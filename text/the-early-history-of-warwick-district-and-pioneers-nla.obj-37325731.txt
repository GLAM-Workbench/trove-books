THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT AND
PIONEERS OF THE DARLING DOWNS.
Dedicated to His Excellency Sir Matthew Nathan, P.C.,
G.C.M.G., Governor of Queensland, with the Author’s compliments,
as a slight appreciation of the encouragement given to record an
accurate history of the very early settlement of the Warwick portion
of the Darling Downs, which was the first occupied.
My parents were intimate friends and school mates of the Leslie
Brothers and Ernest Elphinstone Dalrymple before these gentlemen
left Scotland, and still kept in touch with these pioneer settlers after
they first occupied Toolburra, Canning Downs, and Talgai. When my
parents arrived at Warwick in 1853 the friendship was continued
with the Leslies, but, unfortunately, Ernest Elphinstone Dalrymple
had passed away in 1843. It is this portion which is not altogether
accurate, because Mr. Henry Stuart Russell was an acquaintance only
of the gentlemen mentioned, and had to rely to a great extent on
information given him years afterwards by Mr. Leith-Hay, when he
(Mr, Henry Stuart Russell) began to record certain events for his
Genesis of Queensland.” Besides this the Gammie Bros, were also
intimate friends of my parents. Any other historical efforts which
have been made since Mr. Russell’s work was published are of later
dates, and do not include important historical records which are
referred to by me, obtained first hand from actual pioneer settlers.
If a history is to be of any value it must be accurate, and I have
confined myself to facts, which I trust will give His Excellency the
satisfaction of knowing that he has been, to a great extent, the in-
spiration for having them published, which will harmonise with the
gratification felt generally by the Citizens for the great help rendered
by him in everything tending to promote the welfare of Queensland.
In conclusion I would like to record my thanks to my old and
esteemed friend Mr. F. W. Allen, a native of Canning Downs, for
the assistance he has given me in this matter; also the relatives
of the Pioneers who have kindly contributed photographs.
THOMAS HALL.

PREFACE.
For some time past It has become apparent that the very
earliest settlement of the Southern corner of the Darling Downs has
been leisurely brushed on one side, particularly as regards the
efforts of the rank and file who accompanied the first squatters, or
were employed by them later on. Although the thoughtful por-
tion of the community will not begrudge the pioneer squatters any
of the honour to which they are entitled —indeed they will be only
too anxious for all praise to be given to them —still, they feel that
the people who came under their wing, and afterwards established
themselves as part of the fine yeomanry, and business people
of the State, should not be lost sight of in the chronicle of the early
settlement.
As there was no cultivation worth speaking about until 18
years after Mr. Patrick Leslie reached the Darling Downs, my re-
marks will, for that interval refer principally to live stock, wool and
matters Incidental thereto.
I would have preferred to have seen this written by an abler
pen than mine, but as the links of the pioneer chain are being snapped
daily, I have been asked to record as many of these as I can ere it
is too late. As there were no printed records of current events at
the very earliest period, I shall have to rely, to a certain extent upon
memory, but those who have made a practice of memorising mat-
ters will understand that it can be done with wonderful accuracy.


The Garden of Australia—Allan Cunningham’s Darling Downs.
Physical Features.
Resting on a foundation of carboniferous rocks, where the
Walloon coal measures are prominent, still to be covered by the bas-
alts and Pliocene strata, in which are contained all that remains of
the life of a bygone period. The remains discovered included the
Talgai skull recently found near Allora, which in itself is fairly
clear evidence that in this part of the continent the aborigines
flourished in the pliocene Ice Age. In the same drifts and strataa
are found the remains of immense marsupials and crocodiles, with a
diversity of animal forms all in huge sizes, associated with a one-
time luxuriant growth of vegetation. That the climatic conditions
then were very different to that experienced at the present time, is
certain. All of this makes the Darling Downs an Intensely interest-
ing portion of the continent, for those who understand geology and
appreciate the lessons it unfolds, not the least interesting part being
that lying around Warwick.
It seems very likely that the continent had been convulsed by two
distinct volcanic eruptions as many of the huge fossil remains are
found lying on top of a red alluvial strata under the black. The ani-
mals appear to have been overwhelmed by volcanic mud, and two dis-
tinct flows of basalt, one much harder and more flinty than the other.
As a result of these flows the denudations from them have covered mogt
of the surface of the Darling Downs, with a rich volcanic black soil,
varying in depth from one to two hundred feet, while on some of the
high mountain crests we still find some rich chocolate deposits. In the
lower depressions, as the effect of weather conditions, the rich black
soil has been carried down by water, and filled them up until we find a
large portion of the surface now rich alluvial plains with very few trees,
but covered by the richest grasses and most nourishing herbage.
Concisely, it includes the valley of the Condamine River with its
sources, also those of its tributaries, for many miles, and these, as
they meander through its plains, are, in their permanent holes, filled
with splendid edible fish such as cod, perch, and fresh water cat. At
other places where no surface water exists it can invariably be obtained
at shallow depths, in large quantities.
With an annual average rainfall of 29 inches, and generally an
early wet season, such an area of fine soil fit for cultivation, including
over six thousand square miles of alluvial plains, it followed that this
was soon to be placed on trial by the settlers who came as pioneers in
1840 and afterwards.
Unlike some of Queensland ’s mountains, those bordering the Darling
Downs, which average from two to three thousand feet high, are all
covered by immense scrubs of valuable timbers. These include hoop
pine, bunya pine, cedar, silky oak, beech, yellow wood, crow’s ash, elm,

mahogany, iron bark, stringy bark, box, blue gum, red gum, spotted
gum, sugar gum (which sheds a valuable saccharine in the form of pel-
lets of sugar), and scores of other valuable timbers, which have yet to
be tested in a commercial way.
Its sandstones have been tested for building and monumental
purposes, with great success, so have its limestone deposits, but
its marble and granite beds are still lying in perdu, as are its
numerous beds of excellent pipe clay. Some coal beds have been
worked successfully for years, but there are many others lying
as Nature made them, awaiting the power of Capital to vitalise
the energy of man, so as to make the Darling Downs take its
proper place as a coal mining area.
The whole of these assets placed at our service by nature are
only awaiting the sensible and rational efforts of mankind to make
the Darling Downs become one of the paradises of the human race.
Climate and Scenery.
On its eastern side the sea is 80 miles away by air line, and
the crest of the dividing range benefits by its beautiful effects,
the elevation here averages nearly 3000 feet, while further west
Its average is 1600 feet above sea level. The climate is delight-
fully even, extremely healthy and invigorating, being singularly
free from extremes of heat and cold, making one of the most even
climates in Australia. As a sanitorium for lung troubles, includ-
ing Asthma, it has become a boon to thousands of invalids, and
will become more so with the increase of population.
The beauty of its mountain scenery cannot be surpassed for
variety and grandeur. Although many of its sides are weather
beaten, they are thickly covered by semi-tropical scrubs, the pre-
cipices and ravines being a delightful medley of orchids of many
varieties, flowering climbers, including hoya, and numerous plants
of economic value. The scrubs contain avenues of Tree Ferns and
Palms at the heads of the watercourses, the latter all tending to
the west and north-west, in haromny with the mountain spurs
which radiate from the main body like the points of a compass.
In the forest tops flourishes the giant mountain lily (Doryanthes
Palmeri) with its attractive pink blooms, which seem to be em-
bodied in the ever changing shades of green, purple, and gold ;as
the sun's rays strike the mountain sides. The undulating scenes
of plain and forest lying at the foot of one of nature’s master
pieces simply complete the picture. The beauty of the scenery is
all its own, and cannot be excelled elsewhere.
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.




ALLAN CUNNINGHAM
Discoverer of the Darling Downs


Its Discovery.
Thanks to Allan Cunningham, and Englishman born at Wimbledon,
Surrey, in 1791, we have the first record of the Darling Downs, which
he discovered on the sth June, 1827. It was on this day, from the top
©f the range at the head of Sandy and Thane J s Creeks, that he had
the first view of the “Garden of Australia,” which it is now familiarly
called. Regarding that day, Cunningham in his diary says: —
“The smokes which we had for the last two days observed to
rise from the country to the northward and eastward of us, considered
with the frequent screeching in that direction of the White Cockatoo
(a bird loving to inhabit forest land in the neighbourhood of rivers),
fully satisfied me that we were on the verge of a desirable country.
At our usual hour of departure in the morning we hastened from the
spot on which we had passed the previous night, pursuing our way
in an E.N.E. direction. On climbing a low stony ridge in our way
it was really with the greatest satisfaction that we perceived we
had approached within two miles of the Downs, and as small patches
or strips of mist extended throughout their whole length, and a line
of swamp oak stretched along their south-western extereme, it was
clearly shown us that these extensive tracts of timberless lands were
not wanting in water # Upon accomplishing a journey of thirteen
miles (the last one extending over a commencement of the great
plains) we arrived at the left bank of a small river, about fifteen
yards in breadth, having a brisk current to the north-west. There
was in all parts of its channel, in the neighbourhood of the spot
at which we had made it, a very deep water, which afforded every
encouragement to my people to employ a period of the afternoon
fishing. I sent them away along the left bank, furnishing each with
the hooks and lines. In the meanwhile I obtained some sets of
lunar distances with the sun, the mean results of which gave me for
the meridian of my test 151 deg. 39min. 45sec., but as the accurately
measured distance between it and the north-eastern encampment of
this journey (the situation of which was determined by several obser-
vations aided by correct bearings to certain fixed points on the coast
line) upon being reduced, placed the position of my encampment
Ifmin. to the eastward, its situation may be stated as follows:—'
longtitude 151 deg. 41min. 30sec. E. latitude by observation at noon
sth, 28deg. 9mm. 37sec. S. its mean elevation above the sea shore,
by the barometer being 1402 feet.
“The anglers caught several fine cod, and while thus successfully
occupied on the bank of the river, three natives were seen in the
adjoining forest ground on the opposite bank firing the dried herbage
of these woods. They did not, however, venture to approach towards
my people, but without manifesting the least alarm walked leisurely
away to the more distant parts of the forest. Next day, after
leaving this camp, the party proceeded about half a mile, when they

crossed to the opposite bank,” Cunnihgham in his diary says:—•
“From this stream, which I named Condamine’s river in com-
pliment to the officer who is aide-de-camp to His Excellency the
Governor, we entered upon the extensive Downs before us, pursuing
our way E.N.E. along their southern margin. These extensive tracts
of open country, which I subsequently named (by permission) Darling
Downs, in honour of His Excellency the Governor, are situated in or
about the mean parallel of 28deg. Bmin. S., along which they extend
East 18 miles, to the meridian of 152 deg. ”
So we get the first official intimations of the Darling Downs from
these records; but the eldest son of the King of the Canning Downs
tribe of Aborigines (Darby) told me in the early fifties that the first
white man on the Downs he saw in a black’s camp when a boy, on hia
way to the Bunya mountains, at what afterwards became the Clifton
head station, and who was, no doubt, “Boralcho” Baker, the convict
who escaped from the Moreton Bay settlement, and who lived for 21
years among the Lockyer tribe. This man afterwards surrendered
himself to the authorities, and was employed by Lieutenant O. Gorman,
the Commandant, to show him a track for teams over the Range, other
than Cunningham’s Gap, which he did in 1840. This Gap was at the
head of Hodgson’s Creek, and has always been known as Gorman’s Gap.
Personally! have not the slightest doubt that Baker was really the
first white man to see the Darling Downs.
Now to get back to Cunningham. The 6th and 7th June were
occupied in travelling up the valley of Glengallan Creek, and a camp
was pitched near the foot of Mt. Dumaresq. Two days’ spell were
enjoyed here by the horses, when Cunningham, with one of his party,
climbed and named Dumaresq, and enjoyed the enchanting view lying
at his feet. The plains lying to the north he called Peel’s Plains,
and those south and southeast were named Canning Downs, in honour
of the late Right Hon, George Canning. What is now Maryvale he
called Millar’s Valley. Very heavy rain kept the party in camp for
some days, after which the explorer passed round Mt. Sturt, and Called
what is now Upper Swan Creek, Logan’s Vale, camping five miles up
the creek, and about 10 miles from Double Top. Logan’s
Vale was named after Captain Logan, the then Commandant of the
Moreton Bay Settlement. Several days were occupied here in examining
the scrubs, etc., and the botanist’s love was gratified in discovering
new plants and trees. He was impressed by the immense quantities
of hoop pine. On the morning of June 11th there was a sharp frost,
and at daylight the thermometer was down to 30 degrees. After
climbing Mt. Sturt and the range here, he considered that the gap at
the head of Millar’s Valley was the most practicable for a road over
to the eastern side, which he confirmed. The Logan Vale camp was
latitude 28deg. lOmin. 45sec. S., longtitude 152 deg. 7min, 45sec. E., at
1870 feet above sea level Quoting from the explorer’s diary once
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


more, it is most interesting: —
“In taking a general view of the very superior country at which
the labours of my party terminated northerly, it was gratifying to
observe the range of luxuriant pasturage. This subject of our
discovery, in its plants, rising downs, open wood lands, valleys and
even elevating forest ranges has thrown open to our extensive flocks
and herds in a genial climate, and at an elevation of 1800 feet above
the sea shore. Its timbers, moreover, add to its importance. The
summit and flank of the ranges produce great abundance of well-
grown stringy bark, whilst the lower ridges furnish stately pines of
the species already well known on the Brisbane, varying from sixty
to eighty feet in height, and as small saplings of the red cedar were
observed on the margin of the brushes investing the base of the hills,
large trees of this valuable wood are doubtless to be met with in
their more distant recesses. Although neither coal nor limestone
were found in this tract of country, a quarry of freestone seemingly
well adapted to building could be easily opened on the bank of the
creek about two miles south of the Logan Vale. In fine upon the
consideration that we are occupying a country in which (in the
absence of navigable rivers) an expensive land carriage must ever
be resorted to in the conveyance of produce of the inland to the
coast. The value of this extensive range of pastoral country is not
a little enhanced by its proximity to the seashore, and the seeming
facility with which (w e may reasonably conclude from the moderate
appearance of the interjacent country to the eastward of these
mountains) the fleeces of its growth, as well as the general produce
of its soil, will at some future time be borne down to the shores of
Moreton Bay. 99
On the morning of the 16th June, 1827, that is after spending 11
days on the Darling Downs, Cunningham left for the South, and crossed
the north-eastern edge of Canning Downs, where the plain was not
wider than two miles. After travelling 15 miles that da}, the camp
was made near a chain of small waterholes, in latitude 28deg. 21mm.
17sec. S., longtitude 152 deg. o.2min. E. Next day the party were into
the granite belt, after passing along, what reads like “Lord John
Swamp. ’ } Thus we have the southern corner of the Darling Downs
described for the first time, and how accurately Cunningham described
its future resources even to the present day, sandstone quarry at
Tangan, reads like an inspiration. Naturally his report to His
Excellency Governor Darling became a valuable document, and created
much interest among the colonists at Sydney, and the people of the
United Kingdom, especially in Scotland.
Ernest Elphinstone Dalrymple.
While the people of Scotland were keenly interested in Cun-
ningham’s explorations on the Darling Downs a smart officer named
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


Ernest Elphinstone Dalrymple, on furlough from a Highland regh
ment stationed in India, paid a visit to his ancestral home, Logie
Elphinstone, in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, 'in the late thirties. He
had travelled all over India, Ceylon, and North America, and
was a brilliant platform speaker, having the happy way of attract-
ing and holding an audience. During his son’s visit Sir Robert
Horn Elphinstone Dalrymple gave a social to his tenantry so that
they could meet the visitor, whom many of them had known in his
youthful days. Ernest had now developed into the thoughtful,
campaign-scarred man. and as he had always been a keen observer
the social was to be made doubly attrctive, becuse he was to make
the speech r of the evening. After touching in an interesting way
about the East, also on the slave conditions of North America, fore-
telling the Civil War which afterwards convulsed the United
States, he alluded to Allan Cunningham’s exploration of the Darling
Downs. In a fascinating speech he pointed out the many opportuni-
ties the people had of improving their prospects in life, by going
to the new colonies, and much to the surprise of Ms father and
audience, announced his intention of selling his commission, forming
a party of Aberdonians, and making his way to the Darlig Downs
in Australia. My father was at his social, and with others, was so
impressed by the speech, that they had it printed and circulated
in Aberdeenshire. What tremendous after effects this speech and
the influence of Ernest Elphinstone Dalrymple had will be revealed
as this history is read.
Formation of First Party.
"With the public mind interested, Ernest Elphinstone Dalrymple
(Disney) had no trouble in quickly forming a party of ten young
fellows, in which Dalrymple was placed in charge. Some of the
membeis were George and Flatrick Leslie, George and John Gammie,
George McAdam and James Fletcher. Sir Robert, who was a keen,
practical breeder of high class stock, presented his son with a Poled
Aberdeen Angus bull and two cows, also two thoroughbred blood
stallions, Sr„ Andrew and St George, James Fletcher was placed in
charge of the thoroughbred cattle, whilst George McAdam had
charge of the two blood hoists. The party arrived safe!:/ at Sydney,
but had considerable trouble before the live stock were landed.
Eventually, however, they had to swim the animals to shore.
Dalrymple’s cattle afterwards came to the Darling Downs with
those belonging to Leslie Bros., but the horses came to Moreton Bay
by water, and thence to the Darling Downs overland.
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


Settlement of the Darling Downs.
Thirteen years after Cunningham had sent in his report, we
find him giving full particulars to a friend named Patrick Leslie,
one of the party already alluded to, to enable that plucky indivi-
dual to find his way to the new Eldorado, so as to take it up for
squatting purposes. To further assist Leslie, Cunningham asked
Admiral King to lend Leslie his map, but the Admiral had mislaid
it; however, he was able to give Leslie the exact position of Ben
Lomond in New England, and this became the starting point. Leslie
belonged to a well-known family of that name, whose estate was
Wartle of Aberdeenshire, Scotland. He had three brothers, William,
Walter, and George. On the 2nd March, 1940, Patrick Leslie left
Falconer Plains, his sole companion being Peter Murphy, a native
of Dublin, who had been sent out for some offence, and was assigned
to Patrick Leslie in 1838. Whatever Peter’s offence was Leslie
became greatly attached to him, as the following record by Leslie
■will show: —
“When I was at Falconer’s Plains, and about starting to look
for the Downs, Murphy was the only man I had with me, and not
liking to compel him (a convict) to accompany me, I told him
what my intentions were, viz., to go out to look for the Darling
Downs, and to take only cue man with me, and I asked him if he
was willing to go. telling him I left it entirely to himself.
He looked at ms and said. “Go with you Sir, I would go tc
with you.’ ’ We had a pack horse and a sheep dog with us, also
carried biscuit and bacon, tea and sugar, trusting to our guns for
fresh meat, and lines and hooks for fish, and we lived exceedingly
well. We had a spare shirt, a pair of trousers each, and a single
blanket. This man was about the pluckiest chap I ever came
across in my life, and as good a servant as master ever had.
After working their way out of New England, Leslie in a let-
ter to Henry Stuart Russell, written from Wartle, Auckland, New
Zealand, in 1878, says: —
“On the 14th March, crossing the Severn River, we came on the
junction of a large stream nearly opposite the junction of the
Mole and Severn. This was afterwards called Pike’s Creek. We
followed this creek up a considerable distance, encamping several
nights. We then crossed a range and made a large creek, after-
wards called Sandy Creek, and following the valley thereof,
reached the Darling Downs on the 20th March, about 4 miles above
Toolburra, On the 20th and 21st March explored up the Conda-
mine to Canning Downs, and crossing a ridge, came down the
(afterwards Glengallan Creek), then leaving the Downs about 5
miles below Toolburra, made south for Canal Creek, Quart Pot

Creek, Mclntyre Brook, Severn River, etc., and on the 31st March
reached Cameron’s Station on Bannockburn Plains, and on the
4th April came to Dobie’s camp on Falconer’s Plains. There we
tried hard to induce Dobie to follow us out to Darling Downs, but
in vain. He remained wedded to the Clarence
“On the 12th April George Leslie arrived at Dobie’s Camp with
our sheep, drays, etc., and encamped three miles up the creek from
Dobie s camp. Our stock consisted of 4000 breeding ewes in lamb,
one hundred Sire hoggets, one thousand wether hoggets, one hun-
dred rams, and five hundred wethers three and
four years old. We had two teams of bul-
locks, seven bullocks in each team, one in the
shaft of each dray, 2 drays, a team of horses and dray, also ten
saddle horses. We had twenty-two men all ticket-of-leave, or con-
victs, as good and game a lot of men as s'rer existed, and who never
occasioned us a moment’s trouble —worth any forty men I have
ever seen since,
“On Monday, the 14th April w e started from Falconer’s Plains
camp, went on by easy stages by Beardy Plains, Waterloo, Vivers,
etc., to Mclntyre Station at Byron Plains, where we arrived on
the 2 6th April, and reamined till the Ist May, on which day we
came to George Wyndham’s Station, on what was supposed to be
a branch of the Mclntyre River, then the farthest north station
in New England (West side).
“On the 3rd May we left Wyndham’s, and I marked the first
tree of Leslie’s marked tree line, close to Wyndham’s stock yard.
A blazed line was marked from this to Leslie’s crossing place on
the Condamine River, between Talgai and Tummerville, and we
arrived at the Condamine on Wednesday, the 4th June, without
the loss of a single animal, or breaking a bullock chain. On our
outward route we kept as much as possible on my track when
returning from the Downs in March!
“On the 6th June, leaving all stock, drays, etc., in charge of
the men, George Leslie, Peter Murphy and I left the Condamine
camp and explored the country up the Condamine, by Canning-
Downs, Killarney, Glengallan, and Dalrymple Creeks, returning
to camp on the 13th, and on the 14th, moved up the river, arriv-
ing at the junction of Sandy Creek with the Condamine on the
20th. Here we made a temporary camp intended for our first
sheep station, and for the protection of men and stock, made one
station on the north bank of the river, and two others opposite
one on either side of Sandy Creek, thus giving mutual protection,
and at the same time, deep water between each camp. From this
camp, on the 21st June, George, Murphy and I struck across the
Downs to the northward, crossing by (what is now) Allora, Spring
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


Creek King’s Creek, and on to Gowrie, thence to One Tree Hill.
Finding nothing we liked as much as Canning Downs we re-
turned as far as Glengallan Creek, ran the Middle Gap Creek up
to Cunningham’s Gap, crossed it and followed a creek down to the
Bremer River, intending to go on to Brisbane, but on second
thoughts we feared going without credentials. Recrossing the
Gap we returned to our camp on the Ist July, and next day we
left the sheep at their stations, and moved down some four miles
to Toolburra, where we formed our head station for Patrick Les-
lie we then formed the Canning Downs head station for Geoi ge
Leslie. After that we took up the country from the bottom of
Toolburra to the head of the Condamine, including all tributaries.
Afterwards we gave up what was afterwards called Glengallan
Creek to the Campbells and Fred Bracker, the German’s Creek and
Sandy Creek to the Aberdeen Co.
“Well, to return to the 2nd July, we encamped the drays, etc.,
on the knoll on which Toolburra head station was afterwards
built, and on the 7th July, I left George at Toolburra, and, mak-
>nr ray way by our own marked tree line, I met Dalrymple on the
9th, with our cattle at Quart Pot Creek, camped the night with
him, and next day 1 went on, arriving at the Severn River on the
12th. Found Cox had formed a cattle station since we passed
up, stopped the night there, and having, next morning, reached
Blaxlands station on Fraser’s Creek (also formed since we passed
up) on the 14th July came on the Wyndham’s station where we
commenced blazing our line on our way up, 3rd May.
“On the 19th July I reached a station belonging to Cash, of
New Zealand, and having heard that Hodgson and Elliot were
camped some three miles off I made for their camp, and there
stayed the night. Hodgson was very unsettled as to whether he
would go to the Clarence, or follow out my line to Darling Downs.
I had no difficulty, however, in persuading him to take the latter
course, telling him of a fine country, and how to reach it from
Leslie’s crossing place at the Condamine. This country was Eton
Yale, to which he went straight away. Hodgson must have
reached the Darling Downs early in September, being the first to
go off on my line. We were the only people on the Darling Downs
for fully three months, having arrived on the 4th June, Hodgson
in September. I think King and Sibley were the next settlers, or
probably Isaac, who went out with Hodgson, and may have select-
ed Gowrie before King and Sibley arrived. lam not sure of this,
but if Isaac settled before King and Sibley, the latter had their
stock up before Isaac.
“As for any station being formed before 1840, it is simply rub-
bish. Regarding Warwick, it was never thought of until the end

of 1847, when the Government instructed me to select a spot for
the township, on the Condamine, below Canning Downs, and it
must have been in 1848 when the first settlement took place. In
1847 Genge Leslie had a sheep station on the very spot where
Warwick now stands. I think it was in 1848 that the first land
sale was held. The Survey Office can give the date, and I was the
first man to buy a lot, being instigated to such speculation, extend-
ing to £4, by a sawyer named Joe Russell, a well-known char-
acter in those days, who, when the first lot of land was put up,
addressed me in the following way:—“Come Mr. Patrick Leslie,
buy the lot for luck, you were the first man here, be the
first t( buy,” which I did. This pretty well settles the founda-
tion of Warwick.
“If 1 rightly, Rolleston, as Crown Land Commissioner,
had to appi ove of the site for the town. He may remember if
it was so. At first it was named “Canning Town,” to which name
we all objected, and at our suggestion it was changed by the Gov-
ernment to “Warwick.”
Referring to the matter of supplies for the new Country,
Leslie says. The Penal Settlement was a close one, and no one
could get there except by permission of the Government. The
first supplies were Hodgson’s and my own, and came in 1840
under permits signed by the then Governor, Sir George Gipps.
Even if supplies could have been procured from Brisbane, same
could not have been taken to the Downs, as we all know that no
wheels made could have crossed the Main Range when we first
went up there. Cunningham’s Gap on our side, and the old Hell-
hole road, Drayton side, were the first roads, if they could be so
called, and were cleared by Hodgson, ourselves and others.”
One convincing proof that I was the first man to settle on the
Darling Downs will be found in the following:
When I returned to Sydney at the end of July, 1840, the Gov-
ernor at that time, Sir George Gipps, sent for me, and obtained
all the information I could give him regarding the Darling
Downs, as well as the unsettled districts between the outside
New England stations and the Downs. Sir George expressed hig
pleasure at such a large and fine area of country being explored
and settlement commenced, and asked if there was anything he
could do for me. I replied I wanted nothing for myself, but that
my companion was an assigned servant, a convict for life, and
who had behaved splendidly, standing by me when attacked by
the blacks, when most men in his position would have run, and
I asked Sir George to grant him a ticket-of-leave. This the Gov-
ernor said he would do, and would also recommend him for a

conditional pardon, so Peter Murphy got his pardon accordingly.”
This will show what sort of a man Leslie was, and will always
stand to his credit, for through him, his faithful comrade, Peter
Murphy, occupied a position in the community, which he was en-
titled to hold, namely, a free citizen. That Peter reciprocated the
sterling character of his old employer is undoubted, because he re-
mained with him up to the time Leslie left Queensland. Leslie had
such absolute confidence in Peter Murphy that, the latter practic-
ally became his overseer during their residence on the Darling
Downs, and Patrick Leslie would not allow any person to 'interfere
with arrangements made by Peter, Peter Murphy died at Charters
Towers, Queensland, on the 6th April, 187 8, aged 72 years.
The foregoing clearly sets out the first occupation of the Dar-
ling Downs at Warwick, and the Toowoomba end.
The Aborigines.
In Cunningham’s Diary of the discovery of the Darling Downs
appears the following, when camped at Logan Yale:
“Although very recent traces of natives were remarked in dif-
ferent parts of the vale in which we remained encamped about
a week, only a solitary aboriginie (a man of ordinary stature)
was seen, who, in wandering forth from his retreat in quest of
food, chanced to pass the tents. Immediately, however, on an
attempt made by my people to approach him, he retired in great
alarm to the adjacent brushes at the foot of the boundary hills,
and instantly disappeared. It therefore seems probable that he
had not previously seen white men, and, possibly, might never
have had any communication with the natives inhabiting the
country on the eastern side of the Dividing Range, from whom he
could have acquired such information of the existence of a body
of white strangers on the banks of the Brisbane, and their
friendly disposition towards his countrymen, hs might have in-
duced him to meet with confidence our overtures to effect an amic-
able communication.”
Earlier in his Diary he had referred to his first day’s experi-
ence when camped on the stream he named the Condamine, viz.,
“That three natives were seen in the adjoining forest ground on
the opposite bank, firing the dried herbage of these woods. They
did not, however, venture to approach towards my people, but
without manifesting the least alarm walked leisurely away to
the more distant parts of the forest.”
I have always thought that the friendly approach of Cunning-
ham when camped near Swanfels to the stray blackfellow seen that
day, had its after effects on the “Blucher,” or Canning Downs tribe,
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


of later years, when Leslie took up Canning Downs. It was in 1853
that I first saw the members of this tribe, when they were at their
full strength, and I never met a finer and more trustworthy body of
men than those of the “Blucher” tribe, provided they were treated
fairly, and promises made to them kept. It was entirely owing to
their friendship that the Leslies were not all killed in the early
days of their settlement, as on more than one occasion, when the
warriors of the Macintyre tribe were savagely attacking the Leslies
at Canning Downs, the “Blucher” tribe came to the assistance of
the white people, and saved them from death. For this reason Pat-
rick Leslie named their King “Blucher.” “Blucher” lived to be a
very old man, and it was always an object lesson to the white people
to see the filial affection of his sons in carrying him about for 3
years on a rough improvised stretcher made of a sheet of bark. In
this way they carried him backwards and forwards between Can-
ning Downs and Fassifern, on more than one occasion. “Blucher”
had three sons. Darby, Toby and Tommy, and four daughters. The
eldest son, “Darby,” afterwards became King on the death of his
father. The following incident will show the loyalty of this tribe
to the white people in the early fifties, and had relation to the
first experience of imported Chinese labour at Canning Downs. The
Chinamen quickly discovered that they were being paid less wages
than the whites and, showing their teeth by breaking cast off shears
in two, and attacking the occupant of the butcher’s shop in the
early hours of the morning with the blades. Mr, Hay was cutting
up a bullock in his slab hut, which had only one door as an en-
trance facing east. Some of the black-fellows were camped a short
distance from this hut, including Tommy, who had seen the “Chows”
in the moonlight getting the shears at the shed, and, becoming sus-
picious that there was going to be trouble, sneaked and hid himself
in some bushes, behind a log not far from the hut door. Hay cut
one quarter up, and went round the back of the bench to salt it.
The Chinamen had been watching their chance to get him in this
corner, where he could not escape in a moment. They then drew
their shear blades form their loose jackets, and charged, with the
intention of murdering him. Hay grasped the large cleaver, and
called out for the blacks. The last Chinaman was barely inside the
door when Tommy knocked the five of them down with his nulla,
caught hold of each one by the pig-tail, and threw them out of the
shop. The first question Mr. Hay asked Tommy was, “Did you hit
them hard?” Tommy said, “Baal me hittem hard, only make ’em
bit sleepy; me bin hit ’em along a neck, baal kill ’em, only make
’em bit sick.” After the “Chows” recovered consciousness, they
saw Mr. Hay and Tommy standing over them, one with a stockwhip.
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


the other with a boomerang and nulla. Directly they were able
to walk Hay gave them a taste of the stockwhip, and Tommy ad-
ministered the flat of the boomerang to their “sit upon." They
quickly joined their mates at the gardener's hut, and after events
are recorded elsewhere. Some time after this. Tommy, with a
brother, visited Fassifern and while they were eating their break-
fast, were suddenly surprised by the Black Police, and Tommy was
shot dead. This was one of the most dastardly acts ever commit-
ted by these irresponsibles, which caused intense indignation at
the time, and was not forgotten for years afterwards by the white
people at Canning Downs.
At the time I first saw this tribe, and for years afterwards,
each family had its large, warm opossum rug for winter use. These
rugs were made by the women, of sun-dried, untanned opossum
skins, neatly cut and sewn together. Later on, when Queen Vic-
toria's bounty was distributed on the 24th May each year, it took
the form of a blanket for each member of the tribe. This was the
death knell of the opossum rugs, as they gradually became a thing
of the past, and have long since vanished for ever.
South Toolburra.
As already pointed out, Patrick Leslie actually occupied South
Toolburra on the 2nd July, 1840, with his teams, etc., and leaving his
brother George in charge, departed for the south on 7th July. South
Toolburra was therefore made their headquarters. I have not been
able to find out when Patrick Leslie brought his wife to the Downs,
but It was on September 9th, 1840, he was married to one of the Miss
Macarthurs, of Parramatta, and his brother George married another
sister at about the same time. These ladies, like many other subse-
quent pioneer women, got permission from the New South Wales Gov-
ernment to come through Brisbane, which was at that time a Penal
Settlement, and rode their horses through Cunningham’s Gap, to their
homes on Ihe Darling Downs. They were relatives of Captain John
Macarthur, who took such a prominent and distinguished part in help-
ing to lay the foundations of the merino wool industry of Australia,
and incidentally, of viticulture. As the merino wool industry has
played such a tremendous part in the progress of the Commonwealth,
I now propose to digress a little by recording, concisely, its historical
connection with the United Kingdom and her Colonies.
The Spanish Merino Sheep.
The early introduction of these to the United Kingdom dated
back to 1778, when Lord Somerville smuggled a few of them through
Portugal, but from all accounts they were a failure. Then King
George, in 1791, applied to, and obtained from the Spanish Crown, 4
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


rams and 36 ewes. These were selected from the Negrettes, and not
from the Escurial. The former was the tallest sheep in Spain, but
their wool was shorter than that from the Escurial. In 1808 King
Ueorge received from Spain 200 Paulars, a distinct breed of merinos,
very much like the Escurials. There is nothing recorded that His
Majesty ever received any of the Escurial breed. To be exact, these
sheep came from the Marchioness del Campo di Alange, for which he
paid 8 Royal carriage horses. In the eighteenth century Spain ex-
ported merino sheep to Russia and Norway and, when the 7 years’
war had finished, the King of Spain, Charles 111, made a present of
300 merinos, the pick of his Escurials, to the Elector of Saxony, his
cousin. From this we get the foundation of the Saxon sheep, which in
after years were to play such an important part in Australian and
Tasmanian history, early in the 19th century.
Towards The end of the 18th century the Netherlands Government
who held the Cape of Good Hope, had a fine officer in its employ, viz.,
Ccdonel Gordon, This officer had a hobby of breeding pure merino
sheep, but there are no records to show from whence he obtained these
sheep. However, on his death his widow sold to the members of an
Australian expedition, which touched at the Cape for supplies, viz.,
Lieutenant Governor King and Colonel Paterson, 26 sheep, being 13 to
each, at £4 and £4/4/ per head. Apart from this, she made a present
of 3 apiece to the aforesaid officers. The squadron was in command
of Captain Waterhouse, and Lieutenant Kent, who had to put forth
their best efforts to pay for the sheep.
Captain John Macarthur.
Now we come to a name that every thoughtful Australian can
mentally salute, if for nothing else than for the action he took in in-
troducing merino sheep. Besides this, he was a man that called a
thief a thief, or a rogue a rogue, in the good old John Bull manner.
Macarthur had laid himself out to make a success of the merino wool
industry, owing to the demand there was for this product in the United
Kingdom then, as the result of improved methods of manufacture.
Macarthur wished to buy the whole of the South African thorough-
breds already referred to, but the purchasers declined, and instead,
sold them to William Cox (Paymaster), Rev. Samuel Marsden, and
John Macarthur. The former straight away crossed their units with
the hardier Australian sheep for mutton and wool, but Macarthur
built up a pure bred merino stud from his lot, and by a strange over-
sight from such a thorough-going man of the world, neglected to keep
a pedigree register. In 1800 John Macarthur sent wool to England for
sale, which was pronounced by an expert there, “Could the Colony
produce such kinds of wool it would be a great acquisition to our
Manufactories in England.” A couple of years after this John Mac-
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


PATRICK LESLIE
The first Squatter on the Darling Downs




arthur, In a duel with a superior officer, introduced “Jock’s touch”
to his opponent, and was sent home for a court-martial, because he
loaded up his enemy with a little lead. Not to be bluffed by this he
took home, as baggage, some bales of his wool for sale. The manufac-
turers gave him the heartiest of welcomes, secured his wool, and
straight away petitioned the Imperial Government to give John Mac-
arthur a grant of land in the colony, so that he could extend his
operations to the advantage of the wool trade. The response to this
was a grant of 5000 acres at the Cow Pastures, now Camden, owing
to a great extent to the sympathy of the Earl of Camden, as opposed
by Sir Joseph Banks. Fortified by this grant, John Macarthur now
decided to improve his merino stud, and at King George’s sale of
Spanish merinos, Hampton Court, he purchased in August 1804, 3 rams
and 5 ewes. Having purchased these sheep we find Macarthur now
fighting the United Kingdom’s Customs to get them away, when he
was promptly told that it was a felony to export sheep out of Eng-
land. Once more, however, he smothered opposition, and had his
sheep landed in New South Wales in anything but good condition.
They were then blended with his Gordon-bred South Africans.
During Captain John Macarthur’s exile in England, which lasted
about 8 years, his wife, Elizabeth Macarthur, one of the finest edu-
cated pioneer women ever seen in Australia, took charge of her hus-
band's affairs, and successfully carried on the sheep breeding. On his
return, in giving evidence before Bigges’ Commission, he was able to
say That his flock of merinos had been kept absolutely pure, their wool
improved, while the number had increased, much of the credit being
due to his wife, who also reared a family at the same time, and who
held her own against the raids of murdering aborigines.
Now to get back to the Rev. Samuel Marsden. It is recorded that
he visited England in 1807, and in response to a command from His
Majesty, King George, to visit him, appeared in a coat made from the
wool of his cross-bred flock of sheep. This novelty so impressed the
King that he at once had a similar garment made from the same wool
for himself. Unlike John Macarthur, the Rev. Samuel Marsden stepped
into the blaze of the footlights of the King’s pleasure, and returned
to Australia bringing a few of his Majesty’s choice merinos, as a
present from the King. Thus we find that to a certain extent, this
clergyman shared the honour of establishing the merino sheep in Aus-
tralia. with Captain John Macarthur.
South Toolb arrays History (Continued).
Soon after Toolburra head station was formed, with its slab hut
and bark roof, the Leslie Bros, divided their stock, Patrick remaining
at Toolburra, and George taking Canning Downs, where he placed his
stock. The boundary line of these two stations was at Sandy Creek.
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


In November 1840, Patrick Leslie had the following companions at
South Toolburra; —His brother George, Ernest Elphinstone Dairymple.
Farquharson, and G, K. E. Fairliolme. As Canning Downs had been
formed and equipped with a residence the Leslies sold South Tool-
burra to Mr. Gordon, from whom it passed to Messrs. Fairliolme and
Leith-Hay. It Was during the latter ’s occupancy that the first society
wedding at that end of the Darling Downs took place. The principals
were Mis-s Macarthur of Sydney (a sister to the wives of Messrs. Pat-
rick and George Leslie), and Mr. Francis Robert Chester Master, after-
wards Queensland’s Usher of the Black Rod, This wedding was cele-
brated by the Rev. Benjamin Glennie, the pioneer clergyman of the
Church of England on the Darling Downs, After the function was
c\er, and the majority of the guests had departed, including the newly
married couple, who left for Glenlyon, there remained four gentle-
men, Including the Rev. B. Glennie. These were enjoying themselves
after tea, and without warning, ‘'Jimmy’’ Wilson and one mate, both
wearing masks, stuck up the station, secured the firearms, and took
possession of the place after bringing the cook into the parlour to join
the others. The bushrangers, in a suave and polite way, invited all
present to join them in the good things provided, and the outlaws cer-
tainly had a good time. Before leaving, the outlaws relieved Mr.
Glennie of his watch, then they took Leith-Hay’s firearms and im-
ported thoroughbred mare, and departed. Soon after leaving, Wilson
discovered that they had taken Mr. Glennie’s watch, and he was an-
noyed because This splendid clergyman’s good name had long since
gone ahead of him. An opportunity of returning it presented itself by
a passing mailman from Quart Pot Creek, so, instead of robbing the
mail, Wilson asked the mailman to hand the watch back to the South
Toolburra people, which he did, and Mr. Glennie duly received it.
Later on, when working his way across from Ballandeau, Wilson, with
some more ticket-of-leave men, fell in with a teamster who wag
camped. The dray had some liquor amongst its loading, and the gang
at once helped themselves to it. As there has always been a mystery
about the actual happenings here, I will give the particulars of same,
received from one of the attacking party.
Tt appears, after the gang had freely helped themselves to the
spirits, the teamster seized the opportunity of sending an urgent
courier to the police at Tenterfield. advising them, and giving the num-
ber of men concerned. As the police staff was limited, the officer in
charge enrolled a few young fellows to help them. The latter, think-
ing it was a jaunt to arrest a few drunken men, looked forward to
the fun. When they got in sight of the dray it was covered with the
tarpaulin, and Leith-Hay’s mare, hobbled, was feeding •some distance
away. They thought "Wilson and his mates were dead drunk and fast
asleep. The leader of the party signalled them to dismount. At this
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


junctuie the wind gave the tarpaulin covering the dray a wave, the
horses sweived, and the men beneath the dray fired straight at the
horses. My informant felt a sling in his leg, and his horse fell dead.
The men rushei out from beneath the dray to fight, but were too drunk.
The police fired on them, and in a few minutes there were four men
and three horses lying dead. After the fight the place was called
Wilson’s Downfall. My informant was the man that was shot in the
leg, and for a long time his wound gave him considerable pain, and
would not heal. How I came to meet this man was while mustering
cattle at Upper Emu Creek, at the spot known as the “old sheep
station,’ ’ where I suddenly came upon him bathing his wound at the
creek, after which he applied a poultice of mud. He explained that,
the mud poultices were doing him more good than all the doctors ho
had consulted, and said he had to thank a blackfellow for telling him
of the treatment. Later on he told me of the cause of his trouble,
also about the police recovering Leith-Hay’s blood mare, and return-
ing it to its owner.
The following account concerning “Jimmy’’ Wilson the little
Scotsman, will show what the atrocious system of flogging, practiced
in the army had upon a high spirited man, owing to the whim of an
ex-army officer, his master. Wilson had been an assigned servant of
one of the Leith-Hay brothers, and, for some reason,, which would not
bear daylight at the present time, was subjected to a public flogging
by the authorities, and with this rankling in his feelings, the outrage
was committed at South Toclburra. A personal friend of the writer’s
who knew “Jimmy” Wilson, and bad greet influence over him, assured
me that Wilson was anything but a bad man, but had suffered such an
indignity as a result of what may be aptly termed the abuse of class
distinction, that the worst in the unfortunate man’s nature came to
the surface. It was owing to the advice and influence of my friend
that Mr. Leith-Hay was not shot by Wilson, and incidentally others
with whom he was known to be on intimate terms. Now we get to
more congenial history, the creek between Sandy Creek and South
Toolburra, well known as Badger ; a Creek, was so called after an Eng-
lishman named James Rogers, better known as “Cocky” Rogers, be-
cause he was a Cockney. Rogers came over with Arthur Hodgson’s
stock, which was in charge of Pemberton Hodgson. Another smart
young fellow named Henry Stuart Russell, who was Pemberton Hodg-
son’s friend, w’as also in this party, and it was he who, in after years,
recorded many of the early happenings of this period in his “Genesis
of Queensland.” As Toolburra was so close to Leslie’s marked tree

side, which was known as North Toolburra. The old head station was
consolidated with the Rosenthal property. After this sale Mr. Leith-
Hay received an appointment as Manager of Canning Downs, and the
Gammie Bros., who were then at old Talgai, secured part of the Clif-
ton land.
Eton Vale.
On the 19th July, 1840, Patrick Leslie met and camped with
Hodgson and Elliott in New England. These pioneers were looking
for grazing country, and taking Patrick Leslie’s advice, they made
straight for what afterwards became Eton Yale. They were the
fourth to settle on the Darling Downs, and squatted on Hodgson’s
Creek, twelve miles further down the creek than where the head
station was afterwards established. The locality was called the
“Drummers” Camp, because the owners had a shepherd in charge
who had previously been a drummer in the British Army. One of
iheir companions was Frederick Isaac, of Maitland, who afterwards
selected Cowrie. Others were Pemberton, Hodgson, and Henry
Stuart Russell, “Cocky” Rogers was also with them, but after reach-
ing Eton Vale, received the order of the sack, and a man named
Foster was promoted. John Hill was with the party, but later on
was speared by the aboriginies at Eton Vale, and died from the
effects. These squatters were amongst the first to try and find
a road from the Downs oyer the range to Brisbane, other than the
rough bridle track already found through Cunningham’s Gap.
In 1840 they had Commandant Gorman and his staff, including
“Boralcho” Baker, the guide, as their guests, who paid a surprise
visit by opening up a new road, afterwards called Gorman’s Gap.
On this occasion the first jaunting car to visit the Darling Downs
came laden with luggage and rations, and was drawn by one bul-
lock. This colonial-made vehicle afterwards became the property
of Mr. Henry Stuart Russell, who often scattered the dust about
Cecil Plains with 'it. The dimensions of the car were wrought iron
axle, shafts heavy enough for a draught horse, and sides made to
fold up and down on hinges over the wheels for a seat and foot-
board. If not required for this purpose the sides could be pulled
up, thereby forming a fine strong box, with a very narrow space
between the wheels. Other shepherds employed here were Asplin,
“Scotchie,” Mears, Spiers and Mclntyre. At the first shearing was
Gilbert Elliot, one of the partners, who had been aid-de-camp to
Sir George Gipps, Governor of New South Wales, and who left him
to become a squatter in the Never Never country. His Excellency
who was an epicure as regards food, had a weakness for rounds of
roast beef, which had to be properly cooked, and Elliott was often

pressed into the ser.vice to see that Sir George’s taste was not
spoiled. Disgusted at this he resigned. On this occasion he tried
his hand at wool sorting, preferring it to the aroma from a roast
round of beef.
In 1841 the Eton Yale homestead house was built, and “The
Drummers” became a shepherds camp. In April, 1842, Arthur
Hodgson was married to Miss Dowling, of Sydney, and in the fol-
lowing month he and his wife reached the Eton Vale house. On their
way up Gorman’s Gap this pair had a very strong escort to guard
them from the attack of the aboriginies, “Boralcho” Baker’s erst-
while comrades, who were very dangerous about Flagstone Creek
and other places at the foot of what is now the Toll Bar road.
Among the early employees of Eton Vale was Mr, Christopher
Gorry, who afterwards settled in Ipswich, where he had a large
saddlery business. Mr. Gorry, who was a mate of the John Hill
already referred to as having been speared by the aboriginies, in
giving an account of the tragedy, says:
“John Hill started early one morning for the camp near Mt.
Rascal, in order to take home some bullocks.
He told me to follow him in about half an hour’s time, which I
did, and to my surprise, met poor John Hill with a spear right
between his shoulders, sticking to the saddle while his horse
galloped home, and the spear dangling at the horse’s rump, until
he arrived at the slip-rail near the house (Eton Vale) with my-
self close after him. Mr. Elliott, with myself and others, came to
his relief. We lifted poor John off the horse, and had to cut
vest and shirt on each side of the spear wound ere we could take
it from the wound in his body, four or five inches. He lived in
.great pain. 1 was sent for Dr. Holland at his Broadwater sta-
tion, who attended John for a week, but held out no hope of hia
recovery. He lingered on for eighteen days, and then passed
away. Another station hand and myself attended to his require-
ments up to the time of his death. In those days there were
no coffins at hand, so we made a shroud of his blanket, and buried
his body in a sheet of bark, in a little flat near the garden on
the bank of the creek. Mr. Elliott read the usual burial service,
and this finished the life of John Hill, of Rickmansworth, Hert-
fordshire, England.”
Eton Vale, with the second white woman to reach the Darling
Downs, now became a place of great importance, and was always
looked forward to by the Squatters and Jackeroos as a place of
call. Very simple incidents are often the cause of places receiving
permanent names, such as the spot where Arthur Hodgson
first squatted, viz., the “Drummers” Camp, then later on Eton Vale.


The latter did not receive this classical name from the seat of learn-
ing in England, but from an incident worth recording. Arthur
Hodgson was exploring his new domain, and when 'in the vicinity
of what afterwards became his Head Station, he and his companions
suddenly disturbed a camp of aboriginies, who flew from the white
men, leaving things scattered about their Gunyas or bark huts.
Strangely enough one of the white men picked up a knife here,
which, on examination, proved to have been made by some one in
Eton. Arthur Hodgson then said, "We will call the station "Eton
Vale.”
This incident clearly establishes the fact that the aboriginies of
this locality, by a system of barter, were in touch with white people,
evidently in a more general way than was thought of. Just about
this time the old skeleton of a horse was found in this vicinity. How
did it come there? Maybe “Boralcho” Baker, the escaped white
convict, could have cleared up this all time mystery, but it died
with him.
I had it from a very truthful ex-convict that Captain Logan
was not murdered by the aboriginies, but by one of the convict party
accompanying him.
In later years Mr. John Watts became associated with Sir Arthur
Hodgson at Eton Yale. It was during this period that Sir Hugh
Nelson was employed here. Mr. John Watts was, after separation,
the first member for Drayton and Toowoomba. Then Mr. Ramsay
followed and his descendants took over the Harrow, or western end
of the run, after which the eastern portion was acquired and cut
up into farms by a syndicate. The old head station is now occupied
by Mr. Christopher Barth, a well-known business man of Warwick,
during the eighties.
Canning Downs.
The first building of any kind erected on this station was a
shepherd’s hut, which was built where the Corporation sale yards
now stand, close to the show building and grounds, Warwick. Im-
mediately below it, at the bottom of “SuesI’’ 1 ’’ bathing hole, was one
of the first fords or crossings over the Condamine, which was con-
structed of timber and stones, known as Bowen’s Bridge. A few
years afterwards, viz., 1847, this hut became Warwick’s first police
barracks, the occupants' being Sergt. Thomas McEvoy, with Con-
stables Hourigan and Jerry Scanlan. Gooragooby was the aboriginal
name for this locality. The above hut was built by George Furness,
who was one of the first carpenters on the Downs, and the prin-
cipal in erecting all the important buildings at that period. This
fine pioneer is represented by many descendants in Queensland at
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


the present time, some of whom hold responsible positions in the
Railway Department of that State, while others are prominent in
commercial life. With the completion of the Shepherd’s hut at
Gooragooby, attention w*as directed to building huts for the general
overseer, the sheep overseer, and other employees on Canning Downs,
which was to become the home of Mr. and Mrs. George Leslie. As
regards sawn timber, this was turned out by pit sawing by hand,
and of course was a tedious job. The adze was another useful im-
plement, and helped to fashion hardwood logs and slabs into service-
able timber for all buildings. There was no such thing as giving*
an order to a sawmill as at present, and the completion of a head
station residence was a mater of time. The first house was a
commodious shingled building, which acted as the chief residence
for many years, and was only removed of recent years by the present
owner, Mr. J. H. S. Barnes. The Leslie family occupied it in 1846.
Mrs. Leslie brought a fine young woman from Sydney as her servant
and companion, named Miss Stokes, who was one of the few white
women in the district. The King of the Canning Downs tribe of
aborigines, v/ho had practically taken the white people under his
protection, allowed his two daughters (young women) to join the
staff of Mrs. Leslie. These girls became Mrs. Leslie’s trusted
servants, and acted day and night as her guards against the on-
slaught of the Macintyre tribe. Only six years before, these girls
had never seen a white person, and were typical savages. The
transformation therefore, was one of the most remarkable cases in
the history of the Australian aborigines. Some of the Canning
Downs tribe had inter-married wnth the Macintyre tribe, and by
this means the former got to know of any hostile movement of the
latter, which, with the practical help of Blucher, their King,
saved the whites from massacre.
The first general overseer was Mr. James Hay, who, with his
wife, son, and three daughters, lived here. The sheep overseer was
Mr. William Wilson, one of the most pratcical sheep men then on
the Downs, and w r ho had a free hand from Mr. Leslie. Naturally,
this practical man kept the Macarthur Camden strain of merinos
up to a high standard.
The second shepherd’s hut built, was occupied by the shepherd
la charge of the flock which grazed in the vicinity of the “four mile
water hole,” and Blade’s Hill. This was afterwards known as the
“Jew’s Retreat,” and that name was acquired in the following way:
—The Macintyre aborigines became such a pest that, they had al-
ready given the shepherd here a scare, because it was generally at
this point they first made their appearance. On this occasion he
took advantage of the opportunity to escape by fording the river,
and made for the Canning Downs stables. One of the young fellows

at the stables was an Englishman named “Bill” Jenkins, and being
a bit of a wag, who, at seeing the shepherd’s fear, jocularly re-
marked “It was clearly a case of the “Jew’s retreat.” The shepherd
was a Jew, and that locality has since been called “Jews Retreat. ”
The name had no connection with the “Jew Boy” (Edward Davis)
gang of bushrangers captured by Denny-Day near Murrundi in 1840.
With the completion of the stables here, the imported thorough-
bred blood horses, St. Andrew and'St. George were brought from
North Talgai, where they had been purchased by Ge )rge Leslie, and
installed at Canning Downs. Here we get the starring point of the
celebrated blood horses for which Canning Downs soon became re-
nowned, and which has been continued up to the present day. At
that time John Collins was stud groom, with “Jemmy” Fletcher
as his right hand man. The next horse to arrive was “Tommy,”
the Arab, which was a pure bred Arab, and this stallion immediately
left a favourable and improved stamp on the horses here. Two
other blood horses at the station during the late forties, were
“Knave of Clubs” and “Blacklock.” In the meantime John Collins
had resigned as stud groom, to enter business at Warwick, and was
succeeded by William Chadbourne, who was given a free hand as
regards the mating of the stud stock, “Billy the groom,” as he was
familiarly known, made a great success, and placed the blood stock
on a still higher plane of excellence. Chadbourne was one of these
painstaking, particular men who, very soon, had a place for every-
thing about the stables, and saw that things were kept in their
places. Some time after his residence at Canning Downs he married
Miss Sokes, already mentioned. After the arrival of one of their
children in 1857, Chadbourne was drowned while swimming the
Condamine opposite “Jew’s Retreat,” to register the child’s birth at
Warwick.
Another blood horse at Canning Downs at this time was “Vag-
rant,” who, after he threw and killed his owner. Dr. Miles, was pur-
chased by George Leslie, and went into the stables at Canning
Downs. This horse sired some excellent animals, one being Mr.
W. Duggan’s hurdle horse. “Vagrant” was a handsome chestnut,
and like many of his descendants, cantered high, with the result
that, some riders easily slipped off their mounts. Then came “Sur-
plice” and “Napoleon.”
“Freetrader,” who had won the Liverpool Grand National, was
purchased in England for £ 1000, and imported to Canning Downs.
Strangely enough this horse's stock were never prominent on the
turf, and he could not be considered a success. He afterwards went
to Sydney, and had better luck there.
Another fine blood horse at Canning Downs was “Exhibition,”
who had been owned by John Collins, the old stud groom, during
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.




THE AUTHOR, MR. THOMAS HALL


which time his name was “The Don," but afterwards changed to
“Exhibition" by the Canning Downs people.
“Tombay," a fine Suffolk stallion, represented that branch of the
stud at Canning Downs, his stock being greatly sought after by
farmers and teamsters.
The Leslies were very fortunate in selecting their men, as they
had some very reliable, and trustworthy employees. Among the
Stockmen were James Dale, James Pomphrey and Thomas Robin-
son, who knew every nook and corner of the run.
Soon after George Leslie occupied Canning Downs he
bought a mob of Shorthorn cows from G. Sparks, of the
Richmond River. These were delivered by Tom Robinson, who was
accompanied by his wife, Mrs. Robinson, being the third white woman
to come to Canning Downs. This fine sturdy couple then settled at
Canning Downs, and are now survived by many descendants in the
district. While on this subject it is worth recording that Tom Rob-
inson was the man who carted the first load of coal from Farm Creek
to ihe Ellinthorp Flour Mill at Warwick. Where that coal came from
is now the Tannymorel Coal Mine. Some other employees not men-
ticned previously were Paddy Crack, Paddy Cannon, and Dugald
McCaul, the latter being stationed at the Elbow as first overseer.
Another of the out stations of Canning Downs was the important
“Heifer” station, which stood on the knoll where Allan Cunningham
camped, and where Leslie built the first hut and stockyards, now
known as Yangan. This was occupied by two stockmen, James
Pomphrey and James Dale. The Heifer station included all the country
on Swan Creek, from what is now Yangan to its head, James
Pomphrey was thrown from his horse and killed in 1853, near Mt.
Sturt, at the spot now occupied by the concrete culvert there. James
Dale died in the Warwick Hospital from dropsy in 1867. He was the
last of the original employees of the Leslies.
This place is now the beautiful valley of Swan Creek, made up of
a network of rich cultivation and dairy farms, with smiling homesteads
on all sides, occupied by scores of families. Yangan, the town, and
railway station, look down as sentinels on this charming and pictur-
esque scene on one side, while at their feet on the other side is the
sandstone wall so pointedly referred to by Allan Cunningham. This
sandstone has since become the celebrated Yangan stone quarry which
has supplied stone for some of the city of Brisbane’s most prominent
buildings, also for many fins places in Warwick and elsewhere.
In 1851 Mr. George Leslie fell into had health, and with his wife,
took a trip to the United Kingdom. At this time Mr. Leslie repre-
sented the Clarence River districts in the Legislative Council of New
South Wales, which embraced the Darling Downs, and, as the repre-
sentative of the squatters, interested himself, while in England, in in-
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


terviewing Earl Gray, with the idea of advancing the cause of separa-
tion, In the early part of 1853 Mr. W. Leith-Hay, who had, with his
partner, sold South Toolburra, engaged with the Leslies to manage
Canning Downs during Mr. George Leslie’s absence. Altogether, things
did not proceed as amicably under his management as they should
have done Leith-Hay was a good inside man, and should have de-
voted his attention principally to the duties there. At all events we
find that, George Leslie sold Canning Downs in 1854 to his relatives
Gilbert and Y/alter Davidson, and Mr. Leith-Hay retired. Neither of
the Davidsons had any previous experience amongst stock before buy-
ing the station. Gilbert was a Civil Engineer, and Walter was a sea-
faring man. Walter took charge of the cattle, and Gilbert the horses
and sheep. Walter built a comfortable house at old Killarney, and
resided there. Gilbert lived in the Canning Downs house. In 1855
Captain Daveney arrived as super at Canning Downs, he and his wife
having ridden up from Fassifern over Spicers Gap. During this jour-
ney Mrs Daveney had to carry her infant son in a pannier, fixed to
her side saddle, and arrived safely. This infant afterwards became
Mr. C. E.V. Daveney, who died in harness as Gladstone’s Post and
Telegraph Master, a man who was greatly respected by all classes of
the community. Captain Daveney managed the station until 1866,
when he left for Palm Tree Creek, which property he had purchased.
While at Canning Downs the Captain made great improvements in the
stable, which is still there intact. Canning Downs had now become a
large sheep station depasturing 60,000 sheep. The cattle has also in-
crased by leaps and bounds, so much so that, they w'ere placed in
charge of Mr. W. C. Balls who resided at the Killarney end of the
Estate. Cattle did exceptionally well here, and quickly found their
way on to the mountain tops between Killarney and Emu Creek,
which has always been noted as splendid cattle country. Among the
employees at that end of the run, in those days, were George Davis,
J. Gardner, and Con Horrigan, also Hugh Shanklin, who took over the
old Killarney farm from the Hon. Peter Murray.
With the arrival of the Davidsons and Captain Daveney at Can-
ning Downs the pastime of horse racing received a fine filip. We find
the imported “Freetrader” arrived there at that time, while among
the horses actually racing was the handsome long iron grey horse
“Eclipse.” Although this horse could invariably beat his Ipswich an-
tagonist “Van Tromp,” who had been his stable companion, he had,
when racing In the first Queensland Champion Race at Ipswich on 27th
May, 1861, to suffer defeat by “Van Tromp” and the other starters.
This race was designated as “The Champion Stakes of £1000,” three
miles weight for age. The entries were J. Tail’s “Zoe,” Single’s
‘‘Ben Belt,’’ Mickey Ford’s “Van Tromp,” and “Eclipse. “Zoe”
jumped away with the lead of a head from “Ben Bolt,” and the little
chestnut could not get any nearer to her; then came “Van Tromp. ’ r

an I “Eclipse.” Time, 5.57. “Zoe” won with ease, without
the use of either whip or spur. Later on it is shown
how Canning Downs bad its revenge on J. Tait «C.
Ascot. As a result of the fine forward move made by the Leslies at
Canning Downs, to be continued by the Davidson Bros., in breeding
a high standard of stock horses, Scott and George Elphinstone Dal-
rymple of the Valley of Lagoons district, purchased 1100 head of DDI
horses at £lO each from the Davidsons. This was one of the largest
horse deals of early Queensland, and the horses were driven to North-
ern Queensland, to help expand the early settlement behind Cardwell
and in the North.
Like Rosenthal, Canning Downs was always prominent as a place
of call for visitors. In 1857 Mr. George Elphinstone Dalrymple visited
Canning Downs. He was then second in command of the Gregory-
Dalrymple Expedition. It was this Mr. Dalrymple who first brought
under the State Government’s notice the suitability of the Northern
Coastal areas for the cultivation of sugarcane. This gentleman was a
brother of Ernest Elphinstone Dalrymple, already mentioned.
In 1866 Messrs. Wildash and Hutchinson purchased Canning
Downs, and very soon began to sell parts of it. The Elbow Valley was
secured by Mr. Bettington, while the leases of Emu Vale and Emu
Creek right up to the head of that creek, together with a flock of
sheep, were sold to Messrs. Gillman and Royds for a high figure. Swan
Creek, from the old Heifer station to the head, was purchased by Mr.
John Affleck for a big price. The leases of both blocks of country
were anything but a successful speculation, because the new men had
scarcely got the property going when, in 1868, the State reclaimed the
country and opened it fo' selection. Mr. John Affleck managed to select
the greater part of Swan Creek, while many fine families occupied
Emu Creek, including the Mitchells, Carmodys, Cawleys, Alexanders,
Browns, Gillespies, Hoibergs, Cutmores, Halls, Burstalls, Frees and
Pages, all of whom left their hall mark of progress by hard work and
improvements.
With the arrival of Mesrs. Wildash and Hutchinson the thorough-
bred stud was increased by the addition of Tamerlane, who had been
imported by Messrs. Macartney and Mayne of Waverley Station, also
some fine mares which came from the South. Zanco’s dam, a splendid
grey mare, was here at this time. In May 1872 we find the Canning
Downs stable represented at the Brisbane Races by “The Rose,” and
“Creole,” neither of whom won at that meeting. However, Canning
Downs had revenge on J. Tait of Sydney, by seeing their old well bred
horse “Zanco” beat his Sydney horse “The Quack,” after a dead
beat, in the Queensland Turf Club Handicap.
In May 1872 six head of deer were imported by Messrs. Wildash
and Hutchinson, and liberated on Canning Downs. They got on splen-
didly for a time, but later, encroached on the crops belonging to the
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


farmers, and were eventually exterminated.
The arrival of "‘Tommy” the Arab horse at Canning Downs, with
those in charge of him, created quite a flutter of excitemnet. Mr. Wil-
liam Leslie had just arrived with the horse from India, and in com-
pany with his friend, the Hon. Peter Murray, brought him as a pres-
ent to George Leslie. On their way up from Brisbane they were the
guests, for a couple of days, of Mr. Hugh Allan at the Aberdeen Com-
pany’s Boiling Down Works. Warrell, near Ipswich, who was Manager
of these Works. The three men were Aberdonians, and school mates,
so quite a happy reunion took place there. After resting the Arab,
Mr. Allan supplied them with horses to ride up to the Darling Downs,
and they led Tommy, who was very stiff after the long sea voyage.
It took them two days to do the journey. George and Patrick Leslie
were aware that they were coming, but as things were so unsettled at
that particular time they had no idea when the visitors would arrive.
In the meantime, George and Patrick married two sisters, Macarthurs.
They never let their brother know that they were married, and also
induced Mr. and Mrs. Allan not to tell him when he came to Warrell,
The party arrived at Canning Downs late in the evening, tired and
weary. George was out on the run, and had not come home. Mrs.
Leslie went cut to receive the visitors, not having any idea who they
were, nor did they know who Mrs. Leslie was. They enquired if Mr.
Leslie was in, and she replied no, but that she was expecting him
home any minute, and asked them to let their horses go in the pad-
dock. They looked at each other quite confused. At last William said
that he had brought an imported horse up for Mr. Leslie, and it would
not do to risk letting him go in the paddock. Mrs. Leslie looked sur-
prised, as she had never heard her husband mention anything about
importing a horse. She then called a man named James Fletcher to
take charge of the animal. Fletcher was the man who came out with
Dalrymple’s polled cattle, and had known the visitors while in Scot-
land. When he came within a short distance he recognised them, and
cried out “I am Jimmy Fletcher,” Mr, Leslie thought the man had
gone off his head. Fletcher first grasped one by the hand and then the
other, calling them by their names. The visitors did not recognise
him at first, but suddenly remembered who he was. He had been one
of (senior’s) herd boys in Scotland. In his excitement Fletcher
neglected to introduce the visitors to Mrs. Leslie. Just then Mr.
George Leslie arrived, heartily greeting the gentlemen, and then intro-
duced them to his wife. At first they were surprised, and thought
George Leslie was playing a trick on them as they had never heard
of his marriage. Mrs. Leslie told her husband about the imported
horse his brolhcr had brought, and asked how much he had paid for
it. He, however could do nothing but acknowledge his ignorance in
the matter, William then said that he had brought it as a present

Btroyed at Old Killarney. I consider this was the most perfect horse
that ever came to the Downs. After a couple of days’ rest the visitors
were taken to Goomburra to see Mr. Patrick Leslie returning with Mr.
and Mrs. Patrick Leslie to Canning Downs. Mr. George Leslie took
the new chums out next day to have a look at his run via Junabee, the
Black Swan Lagoon, and across to Loch Lomond. At the latter place
they stopped to have a good look at the mountain scenery. They were
enchanted at the delightful views and clear bracing atmosphere. At
that lime the place was covered with grass knee deep, with flocks of
emus and plain turkeys in all directions, and the lagoons covered wdh
wild fowl. The fat bulocks grazing around were an object lesson,
and, as they were grazing up the valley of Farm Creek a large mob of
thoroughbred horses came racing down the plain, with their manes
and tails waving, and their heads as straight as a blackfellow’s spear.
There are no horses about now to be compared with them. This mob
had been disturbed by a party of aborigines who were hunting.
Introduction of Llamas.
After Mr. Gilbert Davidson took over Canning Downs from his
relative, George Leslie, he gave serious consideration to the sub-
ject of introducing Llamas, principally on account of the high price
Mohair was bringing on the European market. At that time there
was a slump as regards the price of wool, and Davidson, who had
some experience regarding Llamas, thought this animal could also
be used for packing purposes. In 1857 nine Llamas arrived at
Canning Downs, via Spicer’s Gap, in charge of Mr. Edward Dav-
eney, who landed the mob with the loss of only one animal, after
what can be considered as one of the unique droving feats of early
settlement. The Llamas had a repulsive habit of expectorating a
saliva, which threw off an abominable effluvium, over anyone
roughly handling it. This Davidson knew, but kept the secret
until Jack Howe, senior, undertook to do the shearing. Directly
the first Llama was caught and tied down Jack, shears in hand, and
hatless, began to shear, when the now enraged beast promptly spat
oyer his fine black hair. At this period Jack was a handsome
young acrobat fresh from Le Rosia’s Circus, and wore his hair in
the American fashion now so common amongst the fair sex. With
an exclamation of horror Jack flew to the pump, much to the en-
joyment of Gilbert Davidson, and after vigorous shampoos with the
common variety of bar soap, returned to his contract, although the
attar of Tom Cats still clung to him. Jack, however, insisted that
» nose bag should be placed on the Llama before he resumed opera-
tions. This done, everything went along smoothly, but each Llama
had to wear the nose bag. Experience soon proved that, although
the Llamas flourished at Canning Downs they were not a suc-

■cessful substitute for the good old Merino. Later on, they were
transferred to Eton Vale, where the last of the herd only died of
recent years. The Jack Howe referred to was the father of
Queensland’s champion shearer —John Howe, of the Central dis-
trict.
Harry Alphen, already referred to as being at Canning Downs,
had, after he left Queensland, opened an Hotel at Sydney, where
Jack Howe, senior, met him. Infatuated with Alphen’s account of
the Darling Downs, Jack took the first opportunity of reaching it
per Le Rosia’s Circus, and died at Warwick a few years ago.
From Wildash and Hutchison, Canning Downs passed into the
hands of the Hon. J. D. Macansh, who brought his “Gurley” Short-
horn stud here. He also brought some splendid milking Short-
horns. After his death, Canning Downs was sold to a Syndicate,
which cut it up into farms, and that sterling pioneer, Mr. F.
Needham, purchased the Head Station, with its paddocks. Mr.
Needham afterwards disposed of the property to Mr. J. H. S.
Barnes, a descendant of the well-known and highly esteemed
Dyraaba family, who were among the very first families to settle
on the Richmond and Clarence Rivers. Mrs. J. H. S. Barnes is a
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Mytton, who, in the early days of the
Gilbert River goldfield, pioneered and took up Wando Yale and
Oak Park, under the usual trying conditions of those who settled
in the Basalt country. To those who know anything of this coun-
try and the people reared there, it is not surprising that, such an
accomplished horsewoman as Mrs, Barnes, has set a very high
standard of excellence, to which many of the young present-day
girl residents there are striving to attain and demonstrate at
Townsville’s Shows. With Mr. and Mrs, J. H. S, Barnes in resi-
dence at Canning Downs the old station’s reputation for high-
class stock and hospitality are in safe hands.
Lord John’s Swamp (Canning Downs)
This name appears in these notes and as very few people know
how it originated, I wlil state the reason. The Davidsons had two
flocks of sheep grazing in this locality, under two shepherds, both
of whom had the same Christian name, “John.” One man’s flock
grazed on the country above the swamp, while the other lot had
the lower portion of this district. The storekeeper at Canning
Downs, after having made up the rations, was at first put to some
trouble in the correct delivery of them, and, confusion with annoy-
ance to both parties occurred. To obviate this, the storekeeper
began labelling the different lots, one as Upper John’s (Swamp),
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


the other as Lower John’s (Swamp). After this the latter was
manufactured into “Lord” John's Swamp, now this is the official
and local name of the whole locality.
North Talgai.
This property was first taken up by Ernest Elphinstone Dal-
rymple in 1840, and was always known as Old Talgai. It included
part of Clifton, and the whole of Goomburra. This is the Dal-
rymple referred to earlier in this work, and he arrived on the Dar-
ling Downs with his own and Leslie’s cattle, early in July, 1840.
Later on, when the first buildings were erected, George McAdam and
James Fletcher arrived with the imported blood stallions, St. An-
drew and fet, George, the horses they left Scotland with some time
before, and which had been detained at Sydney. After remaining
at Talgai some time, George McAdam left for Brisbane, and built
the first Sovereign Hotel there. Shortly after this building was
finished, Ernest Elphinstone Dalrymple paid a visit to his old school
mate McAdam, and while staying with him, was struck down by
fever, an old Indian legacy, from which he never rallied, and passed
away amongst his friends. Thus, on November 4, 1844, we find
this fine young fellow crossed the divide at the age of 24 years,
and was buried in the old Milton Cemetery. He was the sixth son
of Sir Robert Horn Elphinstone Dalrymple, Bart, and was held in
the highest estimation by everyone who had the pleasure of his
acquaintance. To his Scottish friends he was affectionately known
as “Disney,” and by them his early death was keenly felt, but his
memory has been carefully handed down to their succeeding gene-
rations on the Darling Downs. He was truly a son of the Empire,
and valiantly helped her, as a Unit in her colonising efforts. His
good work was followed up later by his brother George Elphinstone
Dalrymple. The present Dalrymple creek was called after this fine
colonist. After the death of Ernest Elphinstone Dalrymple, the
blood stallions and Aberdeen Angus cattle were transferred to
Canning Downs. The present-day Elphinstone Railway station,
which was on part of his Talgai property, is called after him. Then
George and John Gammie came on the scene.
George and John Gammie, who are referred to earlier as being
in Ernest Elphinstone Dalrymple’s party, were sons of Dr. Gammie
of Aberdeen, Scotland. They were aged 23 and 21 years, respec-
tively, when they landed in Australia with letters of introduction
to the Governor, Sir George Gipps. A rather amusing episode took
place on board ship during their passage out, when a fellow pas-
senger wagered George Gammie 2/6 that he could throw a stone
further than Gammie. Gammie won the 2/6, which was practic-

ally the sum total of their ready cash. On arriving at Sydney, Sir
George Gipps gave these young fellows an introduction to some of
his pastoral friends at Bathurst. They set off on foot for this
place, and obtained work there. Some time afterwards, Catarrh
broke out amongst their employers sheep, after which they were
given 3000 of these catarrh stricken sheep and an old grey mare,
in lieu of wages. About this time the opening of the Darling Downs
reached them, so straight away these young fellows treked over-
land with their sheep and solitary horse, to try their luck there.
It seems incredible that such an undertaking could be possible,
considering that, they were to travel over country practically un-
known, and very few settlers were to be found on the country
'which was known. In spite of this w r e find them getting through,
having travelled .via Liverpool Plains, Tamworth, Barraba, Bon-
shaw, and on to Texas, finally reaching the Darling Downs in
1841. They settled on country adjoining Leslies. The next thing
we hear of them is buying 7000 sheep from Judge Forbes’ sons at
Clifton for 3/ each, and then they almost immediately purchased
part of Clifton station from the same family, giving £ 700 for the
land. In 1848 they acquired old Talgai, but not Goomburra. At
this time, cattle in the Hunter River were selling at 5/ and 6/
each, so the Gammies promptly purchased 10,000 at these prices,
and drove them to the Darling Downs. After fattening them at
Old Talgai they sent several drafts to be boiled down for tallow,
at the Ipswich Works, and made a lot of money on this specula-
tion. The balance of several thousand they sold to W. B. Tooth
Clifton, at £ 3 per head. The Gammie Bros, quickly increased
their flocks with the best Merino sheep to be had, and taking the
advice of Mr. Fred Bracker, Manager at Rosenthal, they wrote to
a noted breeder of Merino sheep in Germany, As a result, they
were fortunate in securing a splendid ram, which they imported
safely to Talgai, and this animal became known as “German
Billy,’’ so as to distinguish him from “Camden Billy,” who had al-
ready been installed at Rosenthal. Here again we become aware
of the wonderful influence, for good, in the merino wool industry,
which Mr. Bracker exercised in his practical way. In spite of
drought, flood, and disease among the sheep, the Gammie Bros,
never looked behind, and in 1854 shore 60,000 sheep. The late
Mr. James Morgan, father of the late Sir Arthur Morgan, managed
this fine property from 1849 until 1854. The Gammie Bros, soon
after their taking oyer North Talgai, imported the thoroughbred
blood stallion, “Conservative,” to take the place of St. Andrew
and St. George, who had gone to Canning Downs. Not long after
“Conservative” was installed here he managed to es.ape, and took
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.




MR. RORY McLEOD


up his abode on Thane’s Creek, where he Quickly formed a wild
mob, and became head of it. After many fruitless attempts to
capture him, which invariably ended by his chasing the horsemen
off the Creek, the Gammies began to think that they had lost him
for good. At this stage of settlement an extraordinary clever
young horseman, named Rory McLeod came on the scene at Can-
ning Downs, and hearing all about “Conservative,” said he could
capture him. This young fellow’s ability as a rough rider was
quickly announced all over the settled portion of what is now
Queensland, particularly about the Brisbane River and Burnett
districts. Mr. R. C. Haly, a prominent squatter of those parts, an
excellent judge and successful breeder of horses, heard of this and,
as he had an expert Mexican in his employ at that time, unsur-
passed In horsemanship, told Mr. George Leslie that he considered
his man superior to Rory McLeod.
As Mr. Leslie had no doubt regarding the accuracy of his own
opinion, promptly made a bet of £SO with Mr. Haly, that he had
a grey horse, sired by “Vagrant,” at Canning Downs, who would
throw the Mexican.
£SO in those days was worth more than now, so the bet was
quickly accepted/ by Mr, Haly and he accompanied his man to Can-
ning Downs. The buckjumping contest was the event of the
season and attracted many colonists to witness it. The Mexican
had scarcely got seated when he was promptly thrown, then Rory
«>
McLeod essayed to win the bet, and when once in the saddle, the
bet was won, because the horse could not shift him, and squealed
with rage at not doing so. At the conclusion of the contest, Mr.
George Leslie made Rory a present of the horse, and it was with
this animal that he rode to old Talgai and essayed to recapture
“Conservative,” Much to the surprise of the onlookers, Rory
worked along quietly, Conservative appearing as if to make his
final charge at the daring horseman. Instead of bolting, Rory
awaited the attack, and by expert horsemanship was able to cajole
Conservative, in that the latter allowed him to get up alongside
him, and by deftly using the rope he had brought, secured the out-
law, who permitted Rory McLeod to ride him home to his old
quarters at North Talgai, at the same time driving the wild mob to
that place. This young champion was thus known from one end
of the Downs to the other, and has become one of the most suc-

THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


In the Gamraie Bros.’ retinue was John Thane, who took over
the Ellangowan country from the Gammies, and formed that sta-
tion. John Thane, however, was drowned soon afterwards at
Leslies Crossing, while attempting to cross the Condamine 'in
flood. Thane’s Creek w'as called after this gentleman.
Early in the year 185 5 the Gammie Bros, sold North Talgai
to Messrs. Hood and Douglas. In 1856 John Gammie died at Ips-
wich, but the other brother, George, went to England. The
Douglas mentioned here afterwards became the Hon John Dou-
glas, who took such a prominent part in the political matters of
the State in the seventies. He was a very clever, brilliant orator,
and one of the finest cultured gentlemen of his day. Mr. Hood was
another fine man whose personality secured him hosts of friends.
He also became prominent in the commercial affairs of the State,
tn which he made a success. Mr. Hood was, at this time, mem-
ber for the Darling Downs in the New South Wales Parliament,
and was really the first man, through John Douglas, to propose
a railway line from Ipswich to Tenterfleld. This in after years be-
came the Via Recta.
From Hood and Douglas this property fell into the hands of
Messrs. Massie and Walker. The property was then cut in two,
Messrs. Clark and Hanmer taking the Old Talgai end, and Mr.
Donald Gunn the southern half, which was always known as
North Toolburra. As Mr. Gunn had already acquired Pikedale, and
found it inconvenient to work both properties, seeing they were
separated, he sold North Toolburra to Mr. Coutts. In Mr. Coutts’
time this station became a fine property, and the Coutts family,
v/hich was a large one, did a lot to advance the Warwick district.
Socially, they were always in the front, and had the esteem and
respect of all classes. This fine family are represented by many
descendants.
In the late sixties Mr. Coutts met with an accident, which
resulted in his death, but this fine property was carried on by his
family. It had come into the front rank as a sheep property,
which position it held dp to the time of its disposal in 1895, when
the State Government repurchased 10,983 acres. The Hereford
stud built up here still survive, in the hands of Mr. Swinburne,
who acquired a large portion of the Estate. It is now worked
by that gentleman as a large farm, with much success. Its allu-
vial flats being the home of lucerne and grain crops.
Messrs. Charles Clark and Thomas Hanmer who purchased the
Old Talgai portion, carried it on as an excellent sheep station.
Their high grade Merino wool and stud sheep appeared at the
piincipal shows, and took many prizes. The Land Act of 1868

Rosenthal.
After the Leslies had given up the Glengallan country to the
Campbell Bros., they also gave up the Germans Creek (so called
after Mr. Fred Bracket, hut now called Rosenthal CieelS

class merino wool production, and the proper classing of it oni the
Darling Downs. Many of the after day experts derived the.,
knowledge of Merino wool from being practically assoicated w>
Mr. Bracker. Up to the time of this gentleman's arrival the high
grade merino wool was that known as grown on the Negre
Spanish merinos. It was of beautiful texture, but very snort in
the staple Mr. Bracker was aware of this, and suggested t
introduction of the "Rambouilet” family of Spanish merinos, who
had a longer staple, although the texture of their wool was also
superfine. The combination of these breeds gave the Daihng
Downs the fillip of its merino wool industry, which will be
blazoned tor all time in the records of early settlement.
Mr Bracker’s right hand man was Mr. Koltz, who was one
of the finest wool classers that ever came to Australia Work-
ing i„ dose touch, these two men built up the Rosenthal Hocks

into very high types, being vigorous constitutioned animals with
heavy and choice quality fleeces. From this we find that the
Germans were really in the vanguard of the scientific portion of
the Merino wool industry. Mr. Koltz afterwards went to live in
the Tenterfield district, where I understand he died. It was
impossible to bluff him, when blinfolded by handing up the same
fleece twice; he could pick it out every time.
Another of Mr. Bracker’s principal assistants was Ben Rus-
sell, who was an all round reliable man with sheep and cattle.
Russell was an Englishman, with a fair education, and a taking
personality, and for that reason was a very useful, trustworthy
employee, in whom Mr. Bracker placed every confidence. As an
instance of Russell’s pluck and, showing that the milk of human
kindness pemeated through him can never be forgotten. In 1844.
on the eve of Mrs. Bracker’s confinement at Rosenthal, the only
white woman who could be of service was Mrs. Hay, who resided
at Canning Downs. Ben. Russell hurried to this station as the
Condamine River was rising fast. He placed Mrs. Hay on horse-
back, and on reaching the river said to her, “What are we going
to do’? Mrs. Hay replied, “It is Mrs. Bracker’s life or mine, go
on,’’ so both entered the Condamine near “Murphy’s” old bridge.
Ben Russell, who was an excellent swimmer, had chosen two
splendid swimming horses. Keeping close to Mrs. Hay, and sup-
porting her with one hand, they both safely negotiated the flood
waters. Mrs. Hay was thus in time to assist her friend, Mrs.
Bracker. The baby boy is now Mr. Harry Bracker of Moreheads
Limited, Brisbane. Ben Russell, who had the reputation of being
one of the finest shearers on the Darling Downs, thought a great
deal of his old master, and stuck to him. After Mr. Bracker
retired from Rosenthal, and settled at Warroo Station, Mr. John
Deuchar took over the management of the N.B.A, Companys pro-
perties. Mr. Deuchar, also a Scotsman, was therefore the Com-
pany’s second manager, one of those sterling pioneers
who helped to lay the foundation of granite on which the Darling
Downs Community of interests rested. This fine Aberdonian was
accompanied by his henchman William Anderson, in whose charge
was the champion Merino ram “German Billy,” already referred to
as being at Canal Creek. John Deuchar was an energetic man
who spared himself very little in the supervision of this grand
property, and, as a consequence was known as a man of iron con-
stitution. Deuchar’s favourite hack then was a grey mare, who,
whenever she had the opportunity, would clear away from Rosen-
thal, anj make straight for a creek near the present day South
Toolburra head station. This creek became known afterwards
as Greymare Creek, and the name has been given to the Railway

Station now serving this locality. By this time much valuable
high class Merino stock had accumulated at Rosenthal, thanks to
the able management of Messrs. Bracker and Deuchar. Now, w ith
the expansion of the squatting industry a great demand set in ioi
young rams of the Rosenthal breed, and they were readily sold at
£25 each, 6 months old,
John Deuchar was always a solid cattle man, and with the
eheep firmly established, directed his efforts towards the forma-
tion of a pure bred Shorthorn stud, so as to improve the cattle
already on Rosenthal. With this in view we find him writing to
the Company’s headquarters in Scotland, recommending that, a
pure Shorthorn bull be sent out to Rosenthal. In response to this
the first Shorthorn imported bull to reach the Darling Downs came,
his name being “Lord Raglan.” This splendid animal quickly
became a valuable addition to the station, and the Raglan bi ecd
was known far and wide. The first best milking cows seen in
the Warwick district then appeared, and although Lord Raglan
was a beef Shorthorn, all of his female stock were exceptionally
good milkers. Still Mr. Deuchar was not satisfied. He then
took the horses in hand, and was responsible for the appearance
of the stallion known as the “Grey Arab,” who came from one of
the Company’s other stations in the Maitland district. This horse
sired some of the finest jumping and fastest horses of that period,
including “Whalebone,” who won the principal steeplechase in
Brisbane’s early days, being ridden by George O’Donnell. Other
horses were “Jemmy Paterson,” who won Warwick’s Town Plate
In 1855, ridden by Mr. John Deuchar; “Tom Brown,” who won
the Maiden Plate at the same meeting, ridden by James O’Donnell,
loaded up with 14 lbs. of shot to make weight. “Jingler,” the
famous lady’s hack, who brought Mrs. Deuchar over the range
from Fassifern, was also a Grey Arab. Then there was “Trot-
ting Billy,” the champion trotter of the Downs, who did the jour-
ney from Rosenthal to the Company’s Boiling Down Works at
Warrell, two miles beyond Ipswich, in one day, arriving there at
4 p.m. Mr. Deuchar always rode and bred his own horses, and had
the reputation of never having ridden a B.K. horse when managing
Rosenthal. B.K. was the Company’s brand for cattle and horses.
In those days there were no decent roads, and neither coaches nor
railways so Mr. Deuchar had to do all his inspection tiips on
horseback, including two trips annually from Rosenthal to Syd-
ney. His right hand man on these trips was “Davey” Thomp-
son. Mr. Deuchar also introduced “Omar Pasha,” one of the first
Clydesdale stallions brought to the Downs. This horse came in
3harge of Mr. William Reynolds, and lived until 1864.
Naturally, with so much inspection work to do, Mr. Deuchar
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


had. to rely upon a trustworthy overseer, and that man was Wil-
liam Anderson. Mr. William Anderson, who had always been as-
sociated with Mr. DeTichar, was one of those thoughtful individuals
who weighed everything carefully in the scales of success before
recommending to his friend and companion. He was a Scotsman
and school mate, as well as ship mate of Mr. J. Deuchar, and is
survived by a daughter, Mrs. J. A. Stewart, of Warwick.
Included in the other employees on Rosenthal at this period
were James O’Donnell, and “Sandy” Ewan, who afterwards took
up and occupied Lake Elphinstone, west of Mackay, called after
George Elphinstone Dalrymple. At this stage, Mr. John Deuchar
and hig friend left Rosenthal for Glengallan.
Following Mr. Deuchar, Mr. James Morgan was placed in
charge of Rosenthal for a short period, and while there the late
Sir Arthur Morgan was born. Mr. Buckland was afterwards ap-
pointed manager, and it was during his term that, the Wash Pool
on Sandy Creek wag erected, under the supervision of Mr. William
Spreadborough, Mr. Donald Mathieson, who was a good sheep man,
now came on to the staff, to help build up the sheep standard,
which had slipped slightly owing to Mr. Anderson’s departure.
Mr. Seymour Metford, a well educated young Englishman, was
the accountant at Rosenthal, and remained in the employ of the
Company up to the time of his death, quite recently.
Mr. Buckland had an anxious time at Rosenthal, as the import-
ance of the Warwick district was rapidly increasing, which im-
portance brought in its train frictions between the townspeople
and the squatters, and tired out by this, he handed over the
management to Mr. L. E. Lester. It was during Mr. Lester’s time
that the Land Act of 1868 came into force, and then Rosenthal
was carved out by the following selectors: —Messrs. Septimus
Keable, Lomas, Gilmour, Grayson, Lockes, Crane, Betzel, Mclntosh,
Afflecks, Burgess, Stevens, Thompsons, Mitchells, and others. The
centre of gravity of this fine old property then shifted to South
Toolburra, with Mr. Augustus Evang as general manager of Rosen-
thal, South Toolburra, and St. Ruth.
During the existence of Rosenthal, we find that it, like its
mates, Glengallan, and Canning Downs, had become a practical
training ground for young aspiring squatters, and, as a conse-
quence, the colony benefitted. Rosenthal was one of the hubs of
society, and was responsible for many of the social functions of
the day. Among the visitors here in 1846 were the explorer
Leichhardt and his party, and again on their return in 1847 in an
emaciated condition from fever, ague, and rheumatism. Once more
Leichhardt was here in 1848, upon hig final trip, never to be heard
of again after he left M'Pherson’s, Buugeworgoria Station.
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


Gladfield.
This place originally belonged to the Leslies, and after Miss
Macarthur married Mr. F. R. Chester-Master, whose wedding is
referred to elsewhere, they settled here for a time. Later on,
this nice little property was purchased by Mr. Neil Ross for the
sum of £75. Mr. Ross had been in the employ of Mr. Dennis,
of Jondaryan, but, with the permission of Mr. Ernest Elphm-
etone Dalrymple. was allowed to remain at the sheep station on
the bank of Dalrymple Creek, at the spot which is now the town
of Allora. Mr. Ross had a very fine family, consisting of three
girls and one son. One of the girls (Grace) married Mr. Fred
Bracker, then manager of Rosenthal Station. Another daughter
married Mi. A. McNab, who afterwards formed the well known
station Kianga, on the Upper Dawson River. This lady had no
family, but was such a benefactress to people of her own sex
(new arrivals) whom she had instructed in the ways of colonial
life, from her remarkable experience, that her name became a
household word in the homes of succeeding generations. A third
daughter married Mr. D. Murdoch, whose descendants still live
In the Warwick district, and hold prominent positions in busi-
ness circles of the present day. Mr. Neil Ross’ son Alexander,
had taken up land on the Dawson River some time after the family
had made their home at Gladfield. His friend, Rory McLeod, gave
Sandy a hand to drive his cattle on to this country, and then re-
turned to the Darling Downs. As the aborigines were very bad
3n the Dawson, Sandy made his mate, Rory McLeod, promise to
muster up his stock if anything unforseen happened to him. Very
eoon after this Sandy Ross was murdered by the blacks, and Rory
McLeod fulfilled his promise by mustering the stock for poor
Sandy’s relatives.
Neil Ross disposed of Gladfield to Mr. Arnold Wienholt about
1852, after which it became part of Mary vale. It was at the Glad-
field’homestead that the first plough was put into the soil of the
Darling Downs, preparing for the first wheat sown, and afterwards
harvested there by Mr. D. Murdoch. Maize was also grown here
at the same time. This spot is now known as Ross’ Corner.
Maryvale.
The Maryvale country was first occupied by Messrs. Cameron and
Coulboii In the early forties. These two fine men followed the first
pioneers very closely along Leslies’ track, and made their camp on the
eastern bank of Millar's Creek, close to where It joins Glengallau
Creek. While here, they had their first shearing, the wool being de-
spatched to the coast via the Spicers Gap country. As it was an im-
possible track for loaded teams, the wool was transported over the
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


range on slides,, and reloaded at the bottom of the eastern side, on to
teams. There was no road over this Gap, the track being the mail-
or a bridle track. One lot of supplies only are said to have
come up from the Ipswich side at this time, and they were also
brought over on slides, and the Gap abandoned for a time as impos-
eible. Messrs. Cameron and Coulson soon vacated this country, cross-
ing over Cunningham’s Gap. The former took up “Tarome,” near
Fassifem, and the latter secured the Dugandan country at the head of
the Tevlot Brook. Walter Farquharson, who came over to the Downs
practically with the Leslies had a very short sojourn here, and then
Mary vale passed into the hands of James Hay, better known as
Bush Hay. The term “Bush” was given so as to distinguish him
from another family named Loith-Hay, who were not related to him,
but were part owners of South Toolburra. Eventually Maryvale was
purchased by Mr. Arnold Weinholt, then Gladfield and Maryvale be-
came the one property, known as Maryvale. Mr. James Hay had a
family. His son, A. Hay, afterwards lived many years at Capella, near
Clermont, where he kept a very nice hotel, and at which place he
eventually passed away. A daughter married Dr. Samuel Aldred of
Warwick, while another daughter married Mr. Thomas Symes also of
Warwick. The Maryvale country has always been considered very
healthy for stock, and made an ideal grazing property for cattle and
horses, being so nicely watered and sheltered. Visitors from the sea.
coast always acclaimed the beautiful invigorating atmosphere of this
mountainous corner of the State. We find the same opinion expressed
by Lord Kerr and Scott in 1851, also by Governor Sir Charles
Fitzroy in 1854, and Governor Sir George Bowen in 1860, while a much
later Governor, Lord Lamington, was enraptured by its delightful cli-
mate and enchanting scenery. As a result of the latter’s visit a fav-
ourite picnicing spot on the crest of Spicers Gap is now called the
Governor’s Chair.
After Mr. Wienholt had taken over Maryvale, it carried a large
flock of sheep for years, and shearing of which was always looked for*
ward to by many of Warwick's expert Knights of the Shears. Later
on this property developed into one of the finest breeding estates for
draught horses that Queensland has ever possessed, the AWI brand
being known all over the State The nucleus of this splendid stud on
the female side, consisted of some half-bred blood mares. On the male
side, the imported stallion “Champion” was the first to he
troduced. Then followed “Iron Duke,” “England’s Glory ” with
“Prince Edward” and Prince Arthur.” The last two were’ bred at
Prince Albert s Royal stud in England. Many admirers of the Clydes-
dale breed often expressed astonishment at the handsome heads the
Maryvale draught stock possessed, in comparison with other studs The
reason for this is traceable to the original blood mares. As regards the
imported stallions, “Davey” Evans brought “Champion,” and John

Mary vale remained in the possession of the Wienholt family (later
the Wienholt Estates Coy., Ltd., in which that family held the con-
trolling interest; the Trustees of Hon, Win. Graham, M.L.C., also
being shareholders) till about 1908, when Mr. Arnold Wienholt, the
present M.H.R. for Moreton, becoming Managing Director, it was cut
up into farms and sold.
Goomburra.
This nice property was part of the Old Talgai Station, taken
up by Ernest Elphinstone Dalrymple, and at his death was pur-
chased by Patrick Leslie, who built the first residence there, as his
head station, and a very pretty site was chosen for it. George
Furness was the carpenter who carried out the erection of this
building, which was to become a mile post in the early history of
the Darling Downs. As Patrick Leslie had sold South Toolburra,
at this time, to Messrs. Fairholm and Leith-Hay, the Patrick Leslie
family removed to Goomburra, which became their home as long
as they resided on the Downs. Peter Murphy accompanied his
master, and remained with him up to the last, retaining Leslie's
confidence as his trustworthy employee and henchman. The Neil
Ross family were also on Goomburra, and resided at that time on
the bank of the Dalrymple Creek, close to what afterwards became
Mr. Samuel Gordon’s Public House, and Allora. Neil Ross and his
family later on removed to Ross’ Corner, Gladfield.
At the time Patrick Leslie resided at Goomburra, John Deuchar
came to the Darling Downs, and was employed by Leslie as his
cattle overseer. After being here for two years John Deuchar
purchased the Canal Creek country, and pursuaded his old mate
and friend, William Anderson, then overseer at Rosenthal under
Frederick Bracken, to manage it for him. While Patrick Leslie was
at Goomburra, he took a very prominent part in the first agitation
which eventually led up to Separation, and in 1851, got into holts
with the Rev. Dr, Lang, whom he called the “Rev. Republican.” In
1854 the first Governor to visit the Darling Downs was Sir Charles
Fitzroy, Governor of New South Wales, who stayed at Goomburra
on his way over the Darling Downs, as the guest of Mr, Patrick
Leslie. This station was sold by Leslie to Mr. Robert Troth, of
Sydney, and by him to Mr. C. S. Green. Among the other em-
ployees at Goomburra during Patrick Leslie’s ownership were
Arthur Macarthur, Manager in 1854, and George and Walter
Donald, two fine men who came to the Downs with the Leslie Bros.
Their sister afterwards married Mr. Edward Anderson, who came
to Warwick in 1845. Mrs. Anderson only died of recent years, and
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


this pair left many descendants in the Allora district.
Patrick Leslie owned a very fine blood stallion named “Boli-
var,” who left some splendid stock behind him, Patrick Leslie
was always the outside partner, and for that reason did a lot of
travelling on horseback. Like John Deuchar, he never kept any
horseflesh except the best. “Creeping Jenny” was a nice mare that
he raced at Brisbane on what is now the Ascot course.
Mr. Patrick Leslie left the Darling Downs in 1854, and resided
in New South Wales up to 1868, when he left for New Zealand, and
took up land in Waikato. From here he returned to North Shore,
Sydney, where he passed away on August 12th, 1881. Mr. Les-
lie’s son became an officer in the Imperial Army.
For a number of years the few settlers who had acquired land
adjoining this station, in the vicinity of Allora, could not expand
their holdings for the members of their families. Then by an
“Exchange Land Act” nearly the whole of the Allora plain was
taken over by the State in exchange for some Western land, and
thrown open to farmers. Now we see the result of this in scores
o 1 smiling farms and comfortable homesteads, with two lines of
railway running through.
During the eighties, Goomburra was the property and resi-
dence of Mr. Edward Wienholt, brother of Mr, Arnold Wienholt,
and father of Mr. Arnold Wienholt, M.H.R.
Canal Creek.
This was a piece of country lying between Talgai and Glenelg
very sweet, healthy grazing land, nicely watered and sheltered.
Hearing from John Gammie that this property could be secured
for a few hundred pounds, John Deuchar, who was then employed
by Patrick Leslie at Goomburra, acquired it, and William Ander-
son, a friend of Deuchar’s, was appointed manager. This place
was stocked up from the Talgai flock, and the first imported ram,
known as “German Billy,” which came to the Gammies from Tal-
gai, was fortunately secured from them, as head of Deuchar’s Canal
Creek stud. As a result of this the Canal Creek station became
renowned for its high class Merino wool, and much credit for this
is due to Mr. Fred Bracker, who told the Gammie Bros, how and
where to obtain “Billy” in the first instance.
Following this, Mr. Thomas Gillespie bought Canal Creek for
what wag consideied a good price in those days. He then mar-
ried Miss Coutts of Ellangowan.
The imported ram “Billy” was not included In the purchase.
At this stage Mr. Fred Bracker retired from the Management of
Rosenthal, and occupied Warroo, Mr. John Deuchar taking over
the management of Rosenthal, as well as becoming the Travelling
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


Superintendent of the whole of the Aberdeen Company's Stations.
His friend William Anderson then became overseer at Rosenthal,
bringing “German Billy" to that station, thus resuming a position
he had previously held under Mr. Fred Bracker.
Glengallan.
As already stated, the Leslies gave up the Glengallan country
to Colin John, and Archibald Campbell, who followed closely in the
Leslies footsteps. The only reasonable assumption as to why they
gave up this portion to the Campbells is that the Leslies were occu-
pying more country than they were entitled to hold according to
the New South Wales license. Whatever the real reason was, we
find that this party followed Leslies’ marked tree line, and crossed
the Condamine at Leslie’s crossing, continuing up the Condamine
to where Campbell’s Gully joins it. They then followed this gully
vp, and first camped on Freestone creek at the head of what has
always been known as Campbell’s Plain and Campbell’s Gully, As
soon as the matter was settled between the Leslies and the Camp-
bells, the latter moved down to the Oaks on Glengallan Creek. This
party’s first camp was too near the scrub, which at that time
almost extended down to Freestone Creek. The mountains were in-
fested by dingoes, while the aborigines became a nuisance, as this
locality became one of their favourite hunting grounds. Between
the wild dingoes of the scrubs and the tamed ones belonging to the
aborigines, Campbell’s sheep had a rough time, many being de-
voured, particularly at night, owing to the fact that there were no
sheep yards. Le Duff, Le Martin and Le Porte, the coloured men of
the party, had to go on guard every night. Then a wet season set
in to cap the misery of these watchmen, which resulted in much
sickness, and the eventual death of two of these shepherds. At this
period of travelling, the bullock dray pole had not been invented,
but instead, one bullock was harnessed, which acted as a shaft
horse does at the present time. Another innovation was, that these
bullocks had to be shod, precisely as horses are at the present
time, in order to take part of the severe strain off them. Naturally,
heavy loads could not be drawn. In after years Le Porte, who had
then become an old man, frequently told me of the severe trials
and hardships endured by members of the party while here camped.
Le Porte was one of the most truthful and gentlemanly men I have
ever met. It was with feelings of pleasure that this party re-
ceived orders to break camp and treck to Glengallan Creek, thence
to the slopes of the mountain which was subsequently called Mt.
Marshall, on which the first buildings of Glengallan Station were
erected.
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


Tlie Campbells party included those fine pioneers, Mr. and Mi's.
Allan Mclnnes, the latter being the first white woman to see the
Darling Downs. Their home was on Glengallan Creek at the
‘•'Oaks,” and it was here their first child was born in 1843. He was
called Donald, and was the first white child born on the Darling
Downs.
His descendants now hold a prominent place in the Civil Ser-
vice of Queensland, and among the leading orchardists of the Dal-
veen district.
As this is a very important part of the early Downs settlement
I am, through the courtesy of a grandson of Mr. and Mrs. Allan
Mclnnes', enabled to give some reliable and interesting facts.
Archibald Campbell organised the expedition at Byrons Plains, and
it consisted of the following:—Colin Campbell (the Commander),
Allan Mclnnes, his wife (the only female in the party, and the
first white woman to arrive on the Darling Downs), Donald Ken-
nedy, a Scotsman, Daly, an Irishman, Smith, an Englishman, with
Tom Savory, an Irishman, and Charlie Sloan, who drove the bul-
lock teams. There were also twelve ticket-of-leave men, as well as
three natives of Martinique (in the French West Indies), whose
names were Le Porte, Le Martin and Le Duff. The Campbell’s
party, with several thousand sheep in their charge, met and camped
with a number of carriers (including one woman, the wife of a
carrier), who were engaged carrying wool by bullock teams to Syd-
ney. A gang of escaped convicts were also encamped close by,
when a fearful fracas occurred between the carriers and the con-
victs, in which the carrier’s wife was one of the principals. This
resulted in the death of the woman, also the husband for the part he
took on behalf of his wife. Mick O’Hara, one of the convicts, but
not a participant in this affair, turned on his mates for what they
had done, shot two of them dead, and joined Campbell’s party, to
whom he rendered splendid service in the journey. Whatever
Mick had done prior to this shooting, the New South Wales police
became greatly attached to his welfare, without, however, finding
him. Knowing this, Mick lived in seclusion for some years at the
head of Freestone Creek, where he died. Of this party, Archibald
Campbell died in Scotland, Colin in Melbourne, Mr, and Mrs.
Mclnnes in Warwick, Donald Kennedy was killed by a dray at Ray-
mond Terrace, Sydney, in 1884, Either Daly or Smith died at
Glengallan and was buried on the bank of the blind creek there,
but which one, I have never been able to identify. Tom Savory died
at Dunwich about 1892, but the end of his mate, Charlie Sloan,
was never known. Most of the ticket-of-leave men died on the
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


Downs. Le Duff was buried at the round water hole, Freestone
Creek, Le Martin an Mr. Thomas Phelan’s paddock, Freestone Creek,
and Le Porte at the Warwick Cemetery. When a very old man, Le
Porte resided in the cottage which used to stand on the bank of
the Condamine at the eastern end of the Helene Street Bridge, and
in one of the heavy floods of the eighties he was overwhelmed and
drowned during the night. Le Porte had been a drummer boy in
Napoleon Bonaparte’s Army at the battle of Waterloo in 1815. He
vfas a very fin 3 man, and a splendid employee. Many present-daj
residents of Warwick remember him well.
The Campbell Bros, afterwards sold Glengallan to Mr. C. H.
Mai shall, an Englishman, and in 1855 Mr, John Deuchar bought
into this property. Mr. Deuchar was then Manager of Rosenthal,
and Superintendent of the North British Australasian Company’s
properties, which position he still retained. Mr. William Anderson,
his old friend and companion, was appointed Manager of this splen-
did station, and took the imported ram “German Billy” with him,
also a number of young rams sired by “Billy,” together with 150
special ewes. The sheep on Glengallan at this time were a nonde-
script common lot, the previous owners not being well up in the
line merino wool, quantity being their slogan.
“Willie” Anderson (as he was familiarly known) set to work,
classed, culled, and threw out the 'inferior ewes, which he fattened
up and sent to the Boiling Down Works. The imported ram “Ger-
man Billy” now became known as “Deuchar’s Billy.” This was the
foundation of the afterwards celebrated Glengallan Stud flock of
Merinos,
With the nucleus of a pure bred Merino Stud here, Mr. Deuchar
further improved it by selecting from Baron Von Maltzahn’s Ne-
jrette flock at Mecklanberg, 10 rams and 10 ewes. The latter
were mated with the original “German Billy,” and the former
were placed with the select ewes, brought from Rosenthal by Wil-
liam Anderson. From this on, the Glengallan Merino Stud at once
fctepped into the very first rank of high-class Merino sheep, having
the blend of the Negrette and Rambouilet strains.
Mr. Marshall, the Senior partner of Glengallan, in 1862, im-
ported a further consignment of select Merino sheep from the same
Mecklenberg flock, these consisted of 15 ewes and 10 rams, this
lot further helping to place the Glengallan flock on a sound foun-
dation, and that strain was known all over Australia. Prizes were
taken at every Show where a Glengallan exhibit appeared.
Later on, when Mr. Deuchar left Glengallan, and Mr. W. B.
Slade took over the management, that gentleman kept the Merino

flock up to 'its high standard, and never once looked back, until
the Station was repurchased by the State, then the flocks were
broken up. In 1895 and 1898 the State repurchased 15,417 acres
from this Estate, and divided it into 141 blocks, which were quickly
selected, thus, this fine old property has now become a close farm-
ing and dairying portion of the Darling Downs.
Pure Bred Durhams.
The Shorthorn herd of Durhams, for which Glengallan became
famous 'in after years under the care of Mr. W. B. Slade, was first
-started by Mr. John Deuchar, whose principal animal on the
female side was “Charlotte.” In 18 66 this herd was further strength-
ened by Mr. Deuchar when he imported that beautiful cow’ known
as “Bonny Belle,” which belonged to the “Booth” family of Short-
horns.
On the male side, Mr. Deuchar had first, the Lord Raglan
blood which had been installed at Rosenthal by him, when Super-
intendent of that, and other Aberdeen Company’s properties. Com-
ing to more recent years, there are many keen observers and judges
of stock still alive, who saw Mr. W. B. Slade’s efforts in building
up the celebrated Glengallan Durham Stud, with the imported
“Mariner” from King George Y stud and other choice Australian-
bred animals. Once more we see, indirectly, the influence of the
Royal Studs, of the Georges, on our two principal industries, Merino
sheep and Durham cattle, now reflected in our Wool, Mutton
and Beef exports. In 1868 Mr. J. Deuchar built the handsome
house at Glengallan where he and his family resided for some
years. This fine building is still a landmark of the efforts of one
of our best pioneers, although “Fate” ruled that he had to say good-
bye to it in the Autumn of his years.
In October, 1872, his Toowoomba admirers took the prelim-
inary steps for the erection of a monument to his memory, appar-
ently, however, it never eventuated, as the only indication of this,
is the tombstone in the Warwick Cemetery, placed there by his
relatives.
In John Deuchar the State found one of its practical pioneer
squatters, who made good under the most trying conditions. One
of his principal aims in life was an endeavour to improve the
breed of all kinds of stock, sheep, cattle and horses, which he
successfully accomplished. He also took a very prominent part
in laying the foundation of what is now the town of Warwick.
John Deuchar was rightly called an honourable, just and upright
man, and the remarks of the poet Burns could appropriately be
applied to him: —

“Oil why has worth so short a date
While Villians ripen gray with time,
Must thou the noble, generous great
Fall in bold manhood’s hardy prime.”
Clifton.
This was also one of the first runs occupied on the Darling
Downs, and was taken up by King and Sibley, who had been
following Arthur Hodgson very closely. In November, 184 0,
these two pioneers were living in a triangular shaped bark humpy
on the bank of the creek now known as King’s Creek. This camp
was removed a few hundred yards lower down the creek, and the
site selected afterwards became that of the Clifton Head Station.
King and Sibley placed their stock on what was ideal grazing land,
and after getting the property well in hand, disposed of it to Sir
Francis Forbes, Australia’s Chief Justice. In 1849 w r e find Lady
Forbes visiting the place for the first time. From Forbes, the
station was sold to John Milbourne Marsh, who called it Clifton
in honour of his birth place. Later on, Mr, Phillip Pinnock ac-
quired it. This is the gentleman, who, in the seventies, was Police
Magistrate at Warwick, and later, at Brisbane. Mr, Pinnock
was a relative of Mr. Henry Stuart Russell, the author of “Genesis
of Queensland.” From Mr, P. Pinnock, the station passed to Ter-
tius Campbell and to George Gammie, then to W. B. Tooth, with
10,000 head of cattle at £ 3 per head. In Tooth’s day, this
station had the reputation of grazing the largest number of sheep
of any property on the Darling Downs—over 150,000. In the
early forties Dr. Miles was a resident here, and had a bush hos-
pital at Ryford, which was a boon to everyone requiring medical
attention. Dr. Miles removed to Warwick, and was the first medi-
cal man to practice there. At Warwick’s first land sale in 1850,
he purchased the fourth allotment sold. The Clifton cattle yards
in W. B, Tooth’s time were a model for the Darling Downs. Mr.
Tooth established a meatworks here, and soon after it was got
into working order, was burnt down and never rebuilt.
In 1896, 1898, and 1899, the State repurchased 27,615 acres from
the owners, and sold to farmers, wbn have helped to make it
one of the jewels of the Darling Downs.
Acacia Creek.
Practically, Mr. J. D. McLean was the first man to settle ok.
this country, and had in his employ as overseer, a very able sheep
man named George Willet. Mr. Willet’s wife was the first white
woman on Acacia Creek station. Mr. McLean sold this property
in 1854 to a Mr. Broughton, who had lately arrived from England,
and was a very fine employer. This place w r as stocked up with
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


sheep, which at first did very well in the dry seasons, but directly
a wet season came it played havoc with the sheep and ruined the
owner. The trouble in this instance was generally known as
“bottle" or “fluke,” which was the worst form of worms. From
thig Acacia Creek developed into a cattle run, and from Mr. Brough-
ton, passed into the hands of Mr. Reid, who had been managing
Maryland. Mr. Reid, together with his family, resided here for
many years, where he died.
Mr, Reid had a fine family of four sons and one daughter.
The eldest, Mr. Ralph Reid, did some of the pioneering of the
Cooktown cattle country at King’s Plains. Mr. Ralph Reid is
now a resident at Cairns. Miss Reid married a Mr. Adams, who
owned Koreelah, their wedding created quite a ripple of excite-
ment at that time. Miss Reid decided that, the Rev. Benjamin
Glennie, who resided in Warwick, should’ perform the marriage at
the Head Station. A difficulty then cropped up, because her home
was in New South Wales, and the Rev. Mr. Glennie held no
license to celebrate marriages in that State. However, it was
discovered that the boundary lines between the two States passed
very close to the Acacia Creek House —only a few yards away.
Some of the family therefore, suggested that a temporary pavilion
be erected in Queensland, where the ceremony could be carried out
legally. This was done, and after the happy couple were mar-
ried, they walked back with the guests to the old home, where the
wedding breakfast was served.
Ellangowan.
This block of country was taken up by John Thane, who ar-
rived on the Darling Downs with the Gammie Bros, in the early
forties. After he had nicely established himself here, he had the
misfortune to be drowned at Talgai Crossing, while attempting to
swim the Condamine River when in flood. Arthur Hodgson, the
owmor of Eton Yale, held a magisterial enquiry, and read the burial
service at the grave. The station, with 5,000 sheep and other live
stock, also including improvements, etc,, and 10 bales of wool,
brought £ 650, the purchaser being Mr. Henry Hughes, owner of
Westbrook. Thane’s Creek, near Talgai, was called after John
Thane. This property then came into the hands of Mr. Thomas
Coutts, who sold to the Peel River Company, which was managed
by Mr. Snell.
Tummaville.
This property, first known as the Broadwater, was originally
taken up by Mr. Wingate in the early forties, but was soon after-
wards handed over to Dr. Rolland and Domville Taylor, Mr. Win-
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.




gate remaining on the Severn, The name of Tummaville origin-
ated by the liberty some of Taylor’s friends took with his name
Domvllle, and that station afterwards became known as Tumma-
ville. Dr. Holland was frequently called upon to give medical
advice in this out of the way portion of Australia, and like Dr.
Miles at Clifton, was greatly sought after by sufferers. This pro-
perty was afterwards incorporated with Yandilla.
Westbrook.
John Campbell, better known by the alias of “Tinker” Camp-
bell who had previously kept the Page Hotel on the Maclntyre
River, had to abandon this place owing to the hostility of the
aborigines. This tribe was always a treacherous lot, as the Can-
ning Downs people got to know. Thus, in 1841 John Campbell
took up Westbrook. After a time he sold out to Henry Hughes
after the latter had dissolved partnership with Isaacs at Cowrie.
In 1853 Hughes disposed of Westbrook to Jock McLean and Henry
Beit, with 16,000 sheep. The price paid for land and sheep
worked out at 15/ per head, everything else given in.
In 1895 the State repurchased 9886 acres of this station, and
alloted it to settlers, where it came under close settlement for agri-
culture and dairying.
Stonehenge Station.
During the early forties a Mr. McConnell (a friend of Captain
O’Connell, afterwards Sir Maurice Charles O’Connell) arrived on the
Darling Downs from the Richmond River, with his sheep. These were
allowed, by the Canning Downs owners, to graze and rest on a piece of
beautiful country near Killamey, until the lambing was over. This spot
was afterwards named McConnell ’s Plain, and has always retained that
name. After leaving here, Mr. McConnell treked to the Brisbane River,
via the Toowoomba route. On reaching the bottom of the Range his
shepherds were attacked and killed by “Boralcho” Baker’s old aborig-
inal friends, and many of the sheep were slaughtered by these fiends.
Included in those who accompanied Mr. McConnell to Killamey was Mr.
Herbert Evans. This gentleman left the party there, and purchased
Stonehenge Station, which he stocked up with sheep, and after getting
the place into proper working order, installed a Manager in charge, and
came to Warwick to reside. He then purchased the Mile End land near
the Cemetery, on which he built a nice residence. Mr. Herbert Evans has
the honour of having introduced the first draught stallion to Warwick,
whose name was “Rump and Stump.” The “Rump and Stump’’ blood
comprised the pick of all horse teams of the day, and was represented
in the district for many years after Mr. Evans passed away. Mr. Evans
had a practical knowledge of agriculture and demonstrated it in his
paddocks adjoining the present Racecourse, Knowing this, a select
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


Committee, consisting of the Hons. R. Mackenzie, Raff, and Macalister,
asked him to give evidence in 1860 regarding the suitability of the Darl-
ing Downs! for agriculture. His evidence was to the effect that, he
limited the distance from the Range to 15 miles, and anyone attempt-
ing it further away was handicapping himself in comparison to the man
who was farming within the 15 mile limit. There was a lot of truth in
this statement. Mr. Evans succeeded Mr. Hunt, and became Police
Magistrate and Clerk of Petty Sessions combined, at Warwcik. Mr.
Evans left three sons, Augustus, Clarence and George, who are survived
by many descendants.
Yandilla.
Following Wingate very closely were the brothers St. George and
P.alph Gore in 1842, the former accompanied by his wife. This party,
after a long and tedious journey by bullock dray, and a flock of sheep,
occupied Yandilla, thinking there was nothing as good further away to
the North West. In 1847, another brother, Robert Gore, and his family
arrived at Yandilla from Sydney, but as they did not like the bush, de-
cided to leave again first opportunity, which was in March 1847, when
they went on board the small steamer ‘ ‘Sovereign, ”at Brisbane. A
fellow passenger was Henry Dennis, the first owner of Jondaiyan.
Henry Stuart Russell, the owner of Cecil Plains, rode night and day
from there to Brisbane, hoping to join them, but failed to get there in
time. When the “Sovereign’ ? was passing out of Moreton Bay via the
South Passage, at Amity Point, she grounded, and was immediately
overwhelmed by the breakers, and with a few exceptions, all on board
were drowned These included Mr. and Mrs, Gore and their two child-
ren, also Henry Dennis. This fearful calamity threw a pall over the
Daning Downs for many years. Yandilla afterwards absorbed North
Branch and Tummaville.
Mr. St George Gore later on took up Bodumba and Canning Creek
properties, bought land at Warwick, and settled at the latter place.
Warroo.
Mr. Fred Bracker, who had been such a mainstay In most of the
early efforts of settlement on the Darling Downs, owing to his prac-
tical knowledge of the sheep and wool industry, as well as agriculture,
now decided to strike out on his own resources. Up to 1849 he had been
the Aberdeen Company’s Manager at Rosenthal, laying the foundation
there of the sheep industry, where upwards of 60,000 sheep were after-
wards shorn. Mr. Bracker took up the country known as Warroo, and
established his home there, which property has remained In the Bracker
family ever since. Associated with Mr, Bracker while In charge of
Rosenthal, was a German shepherd named Peter, who had charge of
the Sandy Creek sheep station at that time. Peter, although not well
educated, was a practical, hardworking, and careful shepherd, who
never allowed rifficulties to beat him.
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


MR. HARRY BRACKER
MRS. FREDERICK BRACKER




Mr Bracket very soon had Warroo established as a sheep station,
with a very fine stock of merino sheep, which reputation it always
maintained. Warroo also became noted for its pure Shorthorn breed of
cattle, in which Mr. Brackets eldest son, Mr. Harry Bracker, always
took such a prominent part, and became one of the cattle and sheep
experts of the Darling Downs. Mr. Bracker is survived by a fine family
of sons and daughters and their descendants.
Glenelg.
This country was taken up by H. Towns & Co., and in 1860 passed
into the hands of Messrs. John Macarthur and A. Stuart. Prior to this
Mr. Macarthur had been at Bungaban in the Wide Bay district. Gien-
elg, although not a rank grass growing station, was always noted for
being splendid sheep country, which good name it still retains. It is
not surprising, seeing that John Macarthur s father was a nephew of
Captain John Macarthur, who established the Camden stud of merinos,
that he carried on the ancestors high reputation of breeding nothing
but the best Merino sheep. In this way Glenelg established its reputa-
tion, and retained it. Mr. Macarthur resided at Glenelg for 16 years,
and then the property was acquired by Messrs. Percival and O’Hara.
The old home of the Macarthur family was on the Parramatta Elver,
known then as the Vineyard. Now it is the Subiaco Convent. As this
Hannibal Macarthur family took such a prominent place in Australian
history, particularly Queensland history, I shall mention the members.
The daughters married Mr. Patrick Leslie, Mr. George Leslie, Hon. P. G-
King, Mr. Gordon, Captain Wickham, and Mr. F. R. Chester Masters,
owner of Glenlyon. The sons were Rev. George Macarthur, John Mac-
arthur of Glenelg, and Arthur Macarthur, Mr. Hannibal Macarthur
afterwards became Police Magistrate at Ipswich.
Mr. John Macarthur is survived by a son, Mr, E. H. Macarthur, in
charge of Queensland Railway Survey Department, who married Miss
Mary Wildash, daughter of Mr. J. C. Wildash, part owner of Canning
Downs in the sixties. Thus we see a nephew of Mrs. George Leslie,
whose husband was the original owner of Canning Downs marrying a
daughter of one of the subsequent proprietors of that historic station.
A few years ago Glenelg was sold to Mr. W. B. Slade, one of the
giants in the Merino wool industry, whose reputation as a breeder of
high class sheep was established at Glengallan, and is now being con-
tinued with great success at Glenelg.
For many years Mr. John Macarthur had the scissors used in shear-
ing the first Merino sheep at his relatives place Camden, which were
given to him by Captain Macarthur. This relic he lent to Mr. Jules
Joubert, -who opened the Jubilee Exhibition, but up to the present they
have not been returned to his descendants.
The Rev. George Macarthur was for many years Head Master of
the Kings School, Parramatta, the oldest Grammar School in Australia.
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK D.SIRICT.


Pilton.
This was a nice property which, at first formed a part of the
Clifton Station, but later on was occupied by Mr. Joshua J. Whit-
ting, and depastured a fair sized flock of sheep. A very comfort-
able building was erected for the homestead, and being nice and
handy to the main road, was a place of call for squatters and
visitors. In 1854 we find Sir Charles Fitzroy, Governor of New-
South Wales, staying here on his way to Warwick. Like Goom-
burra, this station was very prettily situated, nestling at the foot
of the mountains. Cattle and horses did well here, the moun-
tains providing warm winter resorts, with ample feed and water.
For many years during the early settlement the main road to War-
wick passed close to the head station, but in 1857 four loaded
“Warroo” teams accompanied by a Canning Downs team, all from
Ipswich, explored and used the road from “Steel Rudds” to Spring
Creek; now that track is the main road to Warwick.
The First Road Between Brisbane and Darling Downs.
Soon after the Leslies and Arthur Hodgson arrived on the
Darling Downs, glorious rains fell, and as a result, the country
looked a perfect paradise, with its mantle of grass, herbage, and
wild flowers. As can be imagined, the question of food supplies
became a serious problem, and a road to Brisbane town had to be
found, as Maitland, by road, was too far away. The track over
Cunningham’s Gap, from the Ipswich side, was an impossible one
for days. Fortunately, for the Darling Downs in 1840, the Com-
mandant at Brisbane town was a real live officer, named Lieu-
tenant Owen Gorman, who found a track, as already stated, at the
head of Hodgson’s Creek. This enabled Hodgson’s and Elliot’s
drays from Eton Yale, which had managed to slide down the Cun-
ningham’s Gap side some weeks before, in charge of Elliot and
his employee Joe Archer, to load up their stores at Brisbane, which
had come by water from Sydney. They then returned via the new
road on November 12th, 1840. On the 21st of the same month,
Walter Leslie, in charge of the Toolburra bullock teams, went down
this way to Brisbane for supplies, returning on the 14th December
to Eton Yale. Again in February, 1841, Walter Leslie made an-
other trip for rations, and returned safely, although it took him
three days to get from Hell Hole to the top of Gorman’s Gap, From
this it will be seen that, the main road to Brisbane, for practic-
ally the whole of the Darling Downs and the Acacia Creek corner,
was via Gorman’s Gap. This continued for seven years. At last,
all restraints against entering the Ipswich and Brisbane areas from
the west, which had been imposed owing to Morton Bay being a
penal settlement, had been removed by proclamation, so that left

shorter and better road, which would serve all places situated in.
the southern corner of the Darling Downs, instead of coming so fai
north via Eton Yale, stockmen and others were closely examining
the heads of all creeks in this part. In the meantime, practically
the whole of the Downs country had been secured and settled upon
by squatters, making another road to the coast imperative. Apart
from this, Gorman’s Gap road had become very dangerous owing
to the savage attacks of the aborigines, the tribe that Baker had
lived with for so many years. ‘'Tinker” Campbell had a very nar-
row escape from death at their hands, while Pearce’s shepherds at
Helidon were killed. McConnell’s shepherds, who had only re-
cently arrived from the Canning Downs country with their sheep,
had also been killed, and many sheep slaughtered! Sir Francis
Forbes’ drays' on their way to Clifton were stuck up, and their
mntents stolen or scattered about. After these onslaughts, six
soldiers from her Majesty’s 99 Regiment were stationed at the
Rocky Waterhole , and escorted teams over the Gap. Crown Lands
Commissioner in charge of the Moreton Bay area, Simpson and
Christopher Rolleston of the Darling Downs, with their mobile
police staffs, co-operated with the soldiers and kept the road open.
The soldiers barracks were near the spot where the saw mill beyond
the Withcott Hotel now stands, at the foot of the Toll Bar road.
At this stage, the route for the present Toll Bar was surveyed, and
quickly made passable, thus cutting out the Gorman s Gap road,
and providing one of an easier grade, which has remained the best
road up to the present day. The New South Wales Government
advanced money for Arthur Hodgson to expend on this road.
Another Practical Road via Spicer’s Gap.
In 1847, Henry Alphen, who was Stockkeeper at Canning
Downs, and some others employed at the adjoining properties,
found what could be made a practicable road between Mt. Mitchell
and Spicer’s Peak. Naturally this created immense interest in the
South Eastern corner of the Downs, and efforts w r ere at once con-
centrated on it, so as to make it passable for drays. In harmony
with these efforts we find Mr. Fred Bracket, the Darling Downs
“Dive Wire” at that period, writing to the Moreton Bay “Courier,”
Brisbane, on April 22nd, 1847, as follows;
“I have satisfaction in stating that Messrs. Patrick Leslie, John
Gammie, John Deuchar, J. Miller and myself have carefully in-
spected the new line of road, south of Cunningham’s Gap, found
and marked by Henry Alphen, and have ascertained that it will
be a much better road than I expected would have been found or
made on the range. Mr. Perryman, of the “Bush Inn,” with the

greatest liberality has come forward and subscribed twenty
pounds towards the expense of completing the new line, and as the
undertaking will be rather expensive, I trust you will, as a public
advocate, use your endeavours to raise subscriptions for the
same purpose. I need not point out the advantage that will
accrue to Brisbane and Ipswich from the opening of the road, as
it is pretty certain that the traffic both from part of New Eng-
land, and the Severn, will benefit by the projected route. It is
expected that the road will be completed in a few months. Re-
questing your early attention to the foregoing,
I remain, Sir, Yours Faithfully,
F. BRACKER.
Perryman’s “Bush Inn.”
Editor’s Note. —“There can be no question that the opening
of the proposed new line of road will be productive of
immense advantages to the 'inhabitants of Brisbane and Ips-
wich. It is desired, therefore, that the work should be
undertaken, with as little delay as possible. We will do all
that lies in our power to obtain the needful contributions,
and shall at once upen up a subscription last in our office.
As it will be impossible to make personal application, we
think that all who have the means, and are favourably
disposed towards the undertaking, will come forward with
promptitude and contribute their quota.—Editor M.8.C.”
Very soon after this, the New South Wales Government made
money available for work, which was to be spent on labour, under
the supervision of Mr. Patrick Leslie. The squatters also rendered
all the assistance they could, by men and money, with the result
that a rough but practicable dray road became available in a
short time. The New South Wales authorities rewarded Henry
Alphen for the discovery and he at once built a Public House near
the “Black Ridge” at the western foot of the Gap. He also erected
commodious stock yards near by, for the squatters stock, which were
being driven to the Ipswich Boiling Down Works at that period.
Alphen afterwards disposed of the place to Mr. Jubb, and it be-
came known far and wide as Jubb’s Hotel. In 1859, Jubb practic-
ally rebuilt this Hotel, so as to accommodate the travelling public
■which had increased by leaps and bounds. This road became a busy
•thoroughfare, and the arrival of Mr. William Craig, a practical
wheelwright, with his family from Dungog, at Rosenthal, increased
its usefulness, in that Mr. Craig invented the bullock dray pole,
■which did away with the old bullock dray shafts. In this way,
two pole bullocks could be used as polers, instead of one in harness

in the shafts, as hitherto. Larger loads were at once carried, with
lesd danger to the working bullocks.
Practically the first man to take a bullock team and dray
ever this road was J. Popple. Then followed James Craig, who
went to Ipswich, known as Limestone, to bring back a load of iron
for his father’s business. At this time, it usually took 3 6 bullocks
to draw a load up this road. Under these conditions the top and
final pinch gave trouble for many years, more than one bullock
being killed when half of the team was on each side of this narrow
razorback crest. Every bullock driver using this road had to do
something to the boggy crossings through the scrubs, by cutting
down trees and using them for foundations. It was up this road
that Warwick’s first Public House received the first stock of liquor,
consigned to Messrs. Collins and Kirby. This liquor was sold at 1/-
per drink. The driver of the bullock team who brought this load-
ing was young Gray, who afterwards became that sterling pioneer
resident, W. J. B. Gray, of Arlington, near Inglewood. •
Many pioneers belonging to Warwick and the surrounding dis-
trict, treked along this mountain road, including hundreds of
brave women, with their children, many of the latter being infants.
These women deserve to have their names illuminated in letters of
gold for all time. They indeed helped to lay the foundation of our
beautiful Darling Downs. They had come out of a spot on the
eastern side, known as “Hell Hole,” so called because of its wild,
precipitous surroundings, and eerie outlook, ere they reached the
vicinity of the now National Avenue, and Governor’s Chair. That
this trip should have remained a nightmare in the minds of many
of those fine women, for the remainder of their lives, is scarcely
to be wondered at. In one instance a mother and her thiee
children were resting near the spring known as “Mosses Well” and,
only a very short distance ahead of the struggling teams, and
were about to be massacred by some marauding aborigines, when
a young stockman of Leslie’s, armed with large horse pistols, sud-
denly came to the scene from an opposite direction, in time to
prevent it. Had this massacre taken place, these notes would not
have been written. The Stockman’s name was William Jenkins.
The old Public House (Jubb’s) already referred to was a worldly
heaven to these pioneer women, as they found Mrs. Jubb a sympa-
thetic and kind friend, whose memory has been affectionately
handed down to succeeding generations.
When considering the hardships the pioneer women had to go

conditions at open fires, at the same time nursing Infants and
seeing to their other children, which they dare not allow out of
their sight, and comparing our present-day luxurious mode of
travelling by trains, trams and motor cars, it 'is enough to make
the present-day people refrain from complaining at the trivial ills
that they sometimes imagine are hard to put up with in life. In
1855 Mr. Yates, overseer of roads, surveyed some deviations of
this road, and after Separation, in December, 1859, the Queensland
Government took a hand and further improved it by these devia-
tions, cuttings and bridges, the work being carried out under the
direction and supervision of Mr. H. E, Clinton, as Foreman of
Works. Naturally, with these improvements going on, where
£ 60,000 was eventually spent, quite a number of people were
camped in this area, particularly on the eastern side close to the
everlasting spring, always known as “Moss’s Well,” Some of the
macadamised road made there at that period is as good to-day a«
when made. This road was the main thoroughfare up to 1870,
when the railway reached Hendon; then the carriers teams were
gradually displaced by the railway trains, and the Spicer’s Gap road
was not used so much.
In the early eighties, after the Government handed over the up-
keep of the roads to the Divisional Boards, very few, if any, mainten-
ance repairs were carried out here. Then the elements took command,
and quickly ruined its surface. Following this came the bush fires, and
they promptly burnt out all of the bridges. To anyone using this road
now, by vehicles or motor cars, it is simply anathema.
In the very early fifties, a Mr. Balbi erected a nice Hotel at the
foot of the Range on the eastern side, and this place, like Tubbs, did
a fine business for many years, but after 1870 both Hotels did very
little business, and both places eventually closed down, and the build-

vehicle with her husband, was killed, owing to the vehicle capsizing,
and thus ended the life of a sympathetic and kind woman.
Lands Department and Police Department.
In February 1839 the financial condition of New South Wales had
become pressing, and was giving the Governor, Sir George Gipps, a very
anxious time. Besides, an extraordinary session was opened for the
purpose of adopting measures for the tranquility of the districts beyond
the limits of location. At this session Major-General Sir Maurice
O ’Connell and Captain King were sworn in as members. In explaining
the reason for calling the session together he went on to say;—
“The vast interests which have grown up In these distant parts
of the territory, and the number of persons of all classes now en-
gaged in depasturing sheep and cattle beyond what are called the

boundaries of location, might be sufficient of themselves to call for
the protection of the Police Force, but the necessity for it is rendered
far more urgent by the frequent aggressions made of late by the abo-
riginal natives upon the flocks and herds of the colonists, as well as
on the lives of their stockmen, by the outrages which have been
committed upon the aborigines, as well as by them, and particularly
by one atrocious deed of blood, for which seven men suffered on the
tcaflold.
The bill which I shall lay before you purposes to accomplish this
object, by giving the Crown Lands Commissioners who already per-
form certain functions in these districts, fan more important powers
than they now possess, and by providing that each Commissioner
shall be accompanied by a moving Police Force, sufficient to repress
the predatory attacks of the natives, and to keep order amongst all
•lasses.
As it appears ;o me perfectly lust that the persons who are pro-
tected by this force should pay the expense of it, the bill provides
for that object by means of an assessment on cattle and other stock. * ’
As a result of this regulation we find it being applied to the Darl-
ing Downs, and in 1847 a separate police unit was established at War-
wick
Up to D 843 Mr. George Macdonald had been Commissioner of Crown
Lands for the New England district, which also included the Darling
Downs. In that year, however, Mr. Christopher Rolleston was made
Commissioner of Crown Lands for the Darling Downs. As settlement
Was fast spreading to the north-west,, he made his headquarters at the
foot of the hill, almost opposite what is now Carabooya Railway Sta-
tion. Attached to his staff were two policemen.
Mr. Rolleston married Miss Kate Leslie, a sister of the Leslie
Bros., who had pioneered the Darling Downs. Their nearest neigh-
bours were Sir Arthur and Lady Hodgson, at Eton Vale, Lady Hodgson
having arrived there in May 1842, so Mrs. Rolleston had a lady friend
la this pioneer. Their cottage was a charming oasis in the desert of
non-;settlement, and was looked upon as a paradise to the squatters of
the surrounding districts. Hospitality simply beamed from this fine
civil servant and his splendid partner, resulting in their cottage being
a house of call for all of the stations for miles around, as it was con-
venient to the main road leading through Gormans Gap. The first dis-
pute in which the new Commissioner had to assist in settling, was an
alleged “Jumping” case against a Mr. Somerville, who, on behalf of
his employer in Sydney, named Richard Jones, had squatted on a block
of country claimed by Henry Stuart Russell as part of his Cecil Plains
run. This country has always been known since as St. Ruth, which
eventually became the property of the North British Australasian Com-
pany. The decision of the Commissioners Macdonald and Rolleston
was. that Russell had to give it up to R. Jones. After this, Mr. Rolles

ton had to inspect Canning Downs and make a recommendation for the
Bite of what afterwards became the town of Warwick.
Early in :?853 Mr. Rolleston left the colony for a trip to England,
and was carried down to Moretcn Bay in the little “Swallow” (which
Was one of Brisbane’s first river steamers) to join the “Benjamin El-
kin, 7 ' a sailing vessel. On reaching the Bay, it was with the greatest
difficulty that Mr. Rolleston was transferred to this vessel, owing to the
rough seas and crude methods of transhipping at that time. He was
eventually swung from one vessel to the other by ropes, and the Swal-
low passengers were thankful to get into the river again safely. Mr.
Rolleston was succeeded by Mr. W. H. Wiseman, who afterwards went
to Rockhampton.
Hard Times.
The years 1841, 42 and 43 had been extremely severe on the
early squatters, apart from their trials in reaching the New Eldo-
o
rado safely with their stock and equipment. Although the coun-
try had become a grazing paradise for stock, it had been visited by
one of those terrific hailstorms, which we still get every few years.
As a consequence the waterways became flooded, and many sheep
were drowned, while others died from the icy weather in December,
after being shorn. Some flocks were badly stricken by scab, and
we find Mr. Fred Bracker, who was then in charge of Rosenthal
(1841) coming to the rescue of these squatters, with advice, and
the practical assistance of one of his men regarding its treatment.
Amidst these tioubles the Governor of New South Wales recom-
mended the Colonial Office to increase the squatters’ licenses from
£lO per annum to £6O per annum, maximum area at that rate
30,000 acres.
Practically speaking, there was very little coin of the realm
to be seen, very few bank notes in circulation up this way, and
the bulk of the business was done through Sydney firms and banks.
The only squatters having banking accounts at that time were
Henry Hughes, Leslie Bros., Elliot and Hodgson and Gore and Co.
The other squatters had to draw orders on Mercantile firms in
Sydney. These orders were good as long as the wool was on the
way to Sydney, but, as soon as this stopped, the orders were not
negotiable, being valueless. So that practically meant these
orders had to be liquidated not later than three months from date
of issue. Even then, the local business men charged discount of
'/5 and 30 per cent, when accepting them, and if any change was
required, a handful of other paper had to be taken as part pay-
ment- To aggravate the position, many of the banks in Syd-
ney collapsed, business houses closed their doors, and there was
no way of getting wool to Sydney as the bullockdrivers went on
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


strike, many of them holding orders drawn on these houses. Fre-
quently the bullockies lit their pipes with these orders.
This went on for some years, and in desperation the squatters
began boiling down their stock for tallow. Boiling Down Works
prere established a few miles below Ipswich, one of which was owned
by the Aberdeen Company, of Rosenthal, while another one was
started near Mr. Allan Mclnnes’ property, Glencoe, facing what is
now Mr. Scrymgeour’s Estate at Warwick. Harry Alphen was
the owner of this, but it never became a success owing to the cost
of transportation by teams to Ipswich, the squatters finding it
cheaper to make their stock walk to Ipswich, and be boiled down
there. “Tinker” Campbell tried to keep the Warwick pots boiling,
but had to abandon them in favour of works at Kangaroo Point,
Brisbane. The Aberdeen Company’s works at Warrell, near Ips-
wich, were managed by a Mr. Hugh Allan, a brother-in-law of
Mr. John Deuchar, who passed away in 1873 as the result of an
accident. Still the squatters persevered. One, who afterwards
became Sir Arthur Hodgson, with the tenacity of a bulldog, actu-
ally hawked legs of mutton in a butcher’s tray around Brisbane,
and sold them at 1/ each, and won in the long run.
Up to the end of 1847 stock increased at a great rate. Then it
became a serious question as to how the surplus was to be disposed
of, and just as the matter was being settled by making them walk to
Sydney, the drought came on and wiped them off by thousands, which,
with the assistance of busk fires tnat followed, quickly settled the
question. For a time, at least, there was no alternative but to continue
the boiling down process, although the curing of the hides scarcely
paid for the sale required. If alO cwt. bullock netted £2, or an 801 b.
sheep 4/6, the squatters were pleased. Following the trail of this
drought, came the death of most of the working bullocks, and the com-
plete stoppage of transport for some considerable time. As a result,
starvation loomed largely in front of the workers and their families,
because flour, tea and sugar had almost disappeared. Beef and mutton
were poor and tough, with very little nourishment. The grand pioneer
women, with their families, were driven to distraction in their attempts
to counter semi-starvation, and in desperation, boiled and provided pig-
weed as a substitute for our present day vegetables, and sour grass took
the place of boiled rhubarb for puddings. Mountain balm, the good old
substitute for hops, could be Flour at £5 per bag could be
had as a compliment, but without flour balm was curbed in its use, al-
though its mate, the wild Sarsaparilla plant, was a great benefit as
a blood tonic under such trying food conditions. Fortunately for the
people living near the permanent water holes, fish were caught, and a
heavy toll was taken of this food supply. There is one thing that
Australians can always feel proud of, and that is the pioneer women
who helped to blaze the track, who were among the bravest women that

ever breathed the Australian atmosphere. Notwithstanding their every
day trials, the opportunity to educate their children was a heart scald,
because it was absent.
The year 1855 was a very wet one, with a particularly cold wet
winter, which ended in many of the flocks of sheep being stricken with
catarrh. As this was a most infectious disease, the squatters had to burn
thousands of their flocks by the aid of huge firewood fires, and were
driven to their wits’ end to get sufficient labour to stack and burn the
carcases.
Two years following 1857, nearly a twelve months’ drought, once
more, gave the squatters a touch of poverty, but a timely thunderstorm
one night came to the rescue of those persevering pioneers, by intro-
ducing a wet season.
Law and Order—Justices of the Peace.
Among the first Justices of the Peace on the Darlings Downs
were:—

Establishments of Sydney and Moreton Bay, for in many cases
trivial crimes, which, under present-day conditions, the Police
Courts could settle immediately. There were another class com-
monly known as t( Exiles,” who for pronounced political speeches
or taking part in strikes, etc., were quickly transported from the
United Kingdom, “for the benefit of their country,” as it wa*s
naively expressed, but as it afterwards turned out to help the
United Kingdom to be the largest colonising Nation the world has
ever known. Naturally, there were some who had suffered the in-
dignity of being flogged for breaches of discipline. To these the
worst side of human nature sometimes appeared uppermost, and
they caused trouble. It must also be remembered that the white
people on this continent were so few, that the early settlers were
thankful to get what labour they could from this class. Many of
the incorrigibles in the lower portion of New South Wales became

unbearable directly they acquired freedom, and took to bushranging.
It cannot be wondered at, that the influence of these desperadoes,
who had been at the Cockatoo Goal, manifested Itself occasionally
among the young bloods who came under it, and permeated right
through to the Darling Downs, Warwick, of course, feeling its effect.
As a result thereof, the New South Wales Government decided to
extend the control already exercised by Commissioner Rolleston, and
formed a Police Station at Warwick in 1847. Sergt. Thomas McEvoy
was placed 'in charge, with Constables J, Hourigan and Jerry Scan-
lan. Their barracks was the first shepherds hut built by George
Leslie on Canning Downs, and occupied a site near the present-day
Show Buildings. A slab humpy was afterwards built as a Court
House. At this time. Sergeant McEvoy had William dunes as his
ordinary Constable, the other two men having gone, apparently,
with Mr. C. Rolleston to Cambooya, or better known then as Eton
Yale. What a wise act the selection of Sergeant McEvoy turned
out to be, was immediately apparent. This officer, by much pa-
tience, tin tactful, just, and sympathetic application of discipline,
created an atmosphere of security and freedom among all classes
He at once became a prominent resident, and later on, when War-
wick elected its first Aldermen, he was chosen as one of the Council,
and afterwards its second Mayor. Apart from his official duties,
which he resigned in 1859, he always took a part in the first race
meetings, and bred some of the best thoroughbred racing blood of
his day. One animal known as McEvoy’s 33 mare, produced some
high-class animals.
Mr, McEvoy passed away in 1866, and is survived by two daughters
and many descendants.
The next Officer in charge was Sergt, Watts, who also had a fine
personality, and carried on the good work laid by his predecessor. The
Warwick district can consider itself lucky by having had these two
Officers. Sergt. Watts was assisted by Constables Grayson, J. P.
O’Dc-mpsey, E McMullen, and G. Clunes. Later on Inspector Harris
took charge of the Warwick district, and had Sergt. King as his right
hand assistant, with a staff of constables. The district had now be-
come an important one, and from then on to the present day Warwick
has continued to expand.
Police Magistrate.
The first clerk of the Court, who, with the Justices of the Peace,
administered justice in the Slab Humpy Court House, was a Mr. Hunt.
This gentleman was succeeded by Mr. Herbert Evans, who occupied the
dual position of Police Magistrate and Clerk of Petty Sessions in 1853.
He had travelled on the Continent before coming to Australia, spent
some time in France, and generally, was a gentleman of considerable
THE EARLY HISTORY OP WARWICK DISTRICT.


expei ience His home at Mile End was noted for its orchard, and tha
adjoining property across the Condamine for up-to-date farming, of
vffiich Mr. Evans was a keen exponent.
As Warwick progressed, the slab huts gave way to a brick building
for The Court House, and brick cells for a lock-up. These were built at
Albion Street, near where Fitzroy Street crosses it. The Court House,
apart from having justice dealt out, became the only suitable place for
electioneering meetings tc be held, while all concerts were given there
for a number of years, including one by Madam Carrandini and her
daughters, in the sixties. ■,
As This part of the town was low lying, and had suffered morei
than once from heavy floods, this public office, with the others in the
same locality, were removed to finer buildings of stone, erected at the
corner of Guy and Fitzroy streets,
Mr. Evans was succeeded by Messrs. Halloran, Sinclair, and J. C.
White.
Town of Warwick.
With the pulse of settlement becoming stronger every day,
the New South Wales Government saw the advantage of forming
a town on part of the Canning Downs run, and decided that Mr.
Patrick Leslie should select the site for same. This Mr. Leslie
did at the end of 1847, choosing that portion familiarly known as
the Pocket, because on the present site of Warwick his brother
George had a sheep station. On submitting the proposed site to the
Government of New South Wales, they instructed Mr. Christopher
Rolleston, the newly appointed Commissioner of Crown Lands for
the Darling Downs, to approve of the selection, or suggest another.
As a result, the present site of Warwick was chosen. This done,
it was proposed to call the new town “Canningtown,” but that name
did not meet with any favour, and the recommendation of Patrick
Leslie and his friend Arthur Hodgson and C. Rolleston was, to call
it “Warwick.” which suggestion the New South Wales Government
accepted. Mr. J. C. Burnett, Surveyor, was instructed to make the
first design, which he did, and submitted it in May, 1849, and the
Government’s approval was notified in the Government “Gazette”
the same year —Polio 1708. The actual surveys of selections 1
to 19 were made by Burnett in April, 1850, and of subsequent sec-
tions by A. F. Wood and G. L, Pratten in 1857 and 1859, respec-
tively. The principal streets were named by Burnett and subse-
quent surveyors. Burnett passed away at Brisbane in July, 1854.
The first allotment sold was purchased by Patrick Leslie, being
Allotment 1 of Section 2 —Area 2 roods, the upset price being £B.
This was in July, 1850. *
Now we have the first concrete foundations of Warwick, and it
will be interesting to know who were the first purchasers of the town

allotments of this town, sold on the 31st July, 1850, Bth January, 1851,
and 3rd September, .1851. This information is now available, also the
subsequent sales up to November Btb, 1858.
On looking into these names we recognise those who did so much
to give Warwick its first kick off as professional and business men.
As there were no newspapers published in the district at that time, it
is interesting to know how the authorities made known the fact that
there was to be a Government Land Sale. The New South Wales Lands
Department first notified the squatters of the district, asking them
to announce the date of the sale, and it was done in this way—Written
notices were put up on the trees near all slip-rail entrances to the sta-
tions. There were no such things as gates at that time. The squatters
were very anxious to start a business centre where they could get all
requisites they required. It was very difficult to get rations and im-
plements to keep the work going, there being considerable loss of time
owing to this reason. Just then there was a canny Scot named George
Walker, storekeeping and bookkeeping for Colin Campbell at Glen-
gallan. This man built a bark store opposite to where the Glengallan’s
Shire Council’s Office now stands. Mr. Fred Bracker had a man
named Marcus Bierkman in his employ at Eosenthal, Berkman had
been in business in the Old Country, as a saddler before coming to
Warwick, and being a good business man, could see there was a fine
opening for a general store. He, therefore, bought an allotment at
the first sale, and built a brick store in Albion-street, the first brick
buildings built. These two stores were great acquisitions to the town.
Then came that of Mr, John Bowen. These-men, having a good know-
ledge of what stock was required for the district, quickly spt to work
to get it. As a result of their efforts the residents thought as much
of these three stores then, as the Sydney people do now of Anthony
Hordern’s and similar places. Prior to the three stores being built,
there was John Collins & H. Kirby’s Horse and Jockey Inn, at the
corner of Palmerin and Victoria streets. Before this Inn could be
erected, J. Collins had to get a mate named Harry Kirby to pit saw
the timber for it, and collect all round timber required for the build-
ing, after which Kirby became a partner. The building of this Hotel
provided accommodation badly needed, and became the favourite meet-
ing place of the squatters and business people. Church services were
also held here, until the Slab Court House was finished. It was also
the Post Office for a time, and our present townsman, Mr. William
Collins, who was born at Canning Downs in 1848 lived here. The next
buildings erected were a slab hut to be used as a Court House, and
another hut as the lock-up. Sergeant Thomas M 4 Evoy being in charge.
Another hotel quickly followed the Horse and Jockey, and was
built by Mr. John Bowen at what is now East Warwick. When com-
pleted, Matthew M‘ Carthy purchased it, and afterwards sold to Frede-
rick Hudson, the locality then became known as Hudson’s Hill. The

first blacksmith’s shop was owned by Mr, E. Anderson, who had an
employee named Dan Emmins. The latter worked the place. Shortly
after this, Mr, William Craig erected a blacksmith and wheelwright ’»
ahop at East Warwick. Mr. Craig’s arrival at Warwick is certainly worth
recording, as showing the determination and tenacity of this independent
Scotsman. In 1836, he and his family arrived at Dungog, New South
Wales, from Scotland, and remained there nearly ten years, during
which time he built some of the best buildings in that town. At thi*
stage he made a 500 miles ride on horseback to Eosenthal Station, to
see what the prospects were in the New Eldorado, and there met Mr.
Fred. Bracker. The result of the meeting was that Mr. Bracker agreed
to employ him at Eosenthal until such time as Mr. Craig was ready to
establish a business in the district as blacksmith and wheelwright. On
Mr. Craig’s return to Dungog, he mustered up and sold his cattle
at 18/ each, but brought his horses to Eosenthal, which included the
first draught mare that ever came to the Southern Darling Downs.
He and his family eventually reached Eosenthal per bullock dray, which
Mr. Craig had to build, and to which he had to fit a pole, in payment
to the bullock driver Michael Devericks, who transported he and hig
family. This was the first bullock dray pole to be used on the Darling
Downs. After a tedious journey from Dungog, Mr. and Mrs. Craig and
their 5 sons arrived safely at Eosenthal, and the family at once became an
acquisition to the Eosenthal Station. That was in 1847. After this Mr.
Craig bought land at Hudson’s Hill, and on it erected his shop. Later
on, however, he transferred this building to Victoria-street, and en-
larging it, opened and established one of the largest, most commo-
dious and up-to-date blacksmith and wheelwrights’ business ever
established on the Darling Downs. This fine family are survived by
many descendants, some of whom are still carrying on a business
of the same kind in New South Wales. William Craig’s bullock drayg
afterwards helped to build up Warwick to what it had become in 1870,
when the iron horse arrived, and altered travelling conditions consider-
ably.
Warwick made very little progress in the forties and early fifties,
with, the exception of the business places previously mentioned. Then
came the Downs Hotel, built and owned by Mr. Patrick Fleming,
one of old Warwick’s most solid and progressive men, a man whose
word was his bond. Mr. Thomas M‘Evoy, after his marriage, built
his residence where the Glengallan Shire Office now stands, same,
following the Downs Hotel. Mr. Alex. Wagner was next in order,
and opened business as a saddle and harness nmker in a building
erected by himself. In this he did well. The second Hotel built was
nice and handy to Canning Downs, and was well patronised by the
Canning Downs people and visitors going backwards and forwards
from that Station. It was a favourite rendezvous for the young
Jackeroos of those days, and was the scene of many exciting ex-

perienees. One of these events was an occasion when two of the
young bloods happened to be madly in love with one of the belles
of the district, met here, and over their pewters allowed the green-
eyed monster, jealousy, to assert itself, which resulted in a few blows
being exchanged. The fight was immediately stopped by two of their
mates, perfect wags, who remonstrated with the principals at such
unseemly low-down tactics. “If you wish to fight, well fight as
gentlemen with pistols, not as prize fighters,” said they. It was agreed
to use pistols, and seconds were appointed to see the duel carried out.
These two wags agreed that they would load up the weapons with soap
bullets filled with the blood of a bullock just killed at the yard up from
the public house. In the meantime, each contestant had screwed up his
courage with a drink or two. Then at the command from the seconds
they became “set” at the appointed distance, a few feet apart. At
the word “Fire” one was struck on the forehead, the other bullet
missed. ■ Seeing this, the fight was stopped, and the man who thought
he was wounded felt the bullock’s gore trickling down his nose. He
straightaway put his hand up to his forehead, saw the claret, and con-
sidered that it would only be a matter of a very short time before
he passed away, pathetically said good-bye to all, and fainted. He was
gently assisted to a couch, made comfortable, and instead of dying,
went off to sleep. On waking up he received another shock to find he
was aliv°. The young lady had no time for either of the duellists,
but married a fine young fellow in no way associated with them. This
Hotel subsequently passed info the hands of Mr, Fred. Hudson.
After the first business places had been established in Warwick,
the married people on the adjoining stations nearly all bought land
in town and built houses for their families. So as to make a com-
parison between these early home and present day residents 1 I will
give some particulars of the rough and ready abodes. The houses
were of round posts placed three feet in the ground, split slabs for
walls, round saplings for rafters, with stringy bark for roof, while
ant bed mixed similar to mortor, constituted what they called a first
class floor. A round hollow log split in two was the spout between
the chimney and the gable end of the building. The fire places
in these huts were usually 8 feet long by 5 feet deep, and 6 feet high,
lined with zinc taken out of old cases. After sundown, these humble
dwellings were principally lit up by the fire in their huge fire places,
or by the aid of what they called a “fat lamp.” This lamp was an
ordinary tin such as that used for preserves, which was filled with
tallow, and contained a piece of candle cotton for a wick. An im-
provement on this was effected by using moulds, into which, after
installing wicks of cotton, melted fat was poured. The result was,
the tallow candles, which became quite a boon. All early day school
exercises and clerical work were written by the aid of these candles.
After that, the invention of the day, for lighting purposes (kerosene)

came into use, anl created quite an advance in the comforts of civili-
sation. This continued for many years, when, with the advance of
the times, quite an up-to-date gasometer and equipment were erected,
which gave the people an improved light, together with an extra
cooking advantage. Not satisfied with these, the electric light was
installed in the town. Now with these two lighing systems the
people are keeping in step with the luxuries of civilisation
Separation.
In the early fifties there was an intense struggle for the Separa-
tion of the Northern part of New South Wales, so as to make it into
another State. Practically all of the people were unanimous for
this. Among the members of the most determined advance guard
were Patrick Leslie and Arthur Hodgson, the men who weie the
first to settle on the Darling Downs. Some of the squatters had
received great assistance from the ticket-of-leave and exile labour,
and recognised that there were many excellent men who had been forced
into that class under the flimsiest reasons. These squatters openly
said that, it would be an advantage to still have some of this labour
as a leaven with that of the free Immigrant. By degrees a cleavage
took place, and the colonists were sharply divided into two parties
because one group would have the transportation of criminals, as
they were called, stopped, and were only in favour of Free Immi-
grants. These groups became known as the Conservatives and Lib-
erals. At this stage, a Presbyterian Clergyman named Dr. Lang,
was intensely ernest in his efforts to introduce free Immigrants of
the best classes from the United Kingdom, which afterwards be-
came a boon to this State. As a result, he fell out with some of the
progressive squatters, particularly Sir Arthur Hodgson and Mr. Pat-
rick Leslie. Dr. Lang was a very impulsive, determined man, and
had only theory to lead him in any of the industries, otherwise he
wmuld not have been so unreasonable with Sir Arthur Hodgson and
Mr. Patrick Leslie as he was. With a view of seeing the Darling
Downs, and forming an opinion of its potentialities, Dr. Lang visited
Warwick in 1854, when the country was passing through a nine
month’s drought. He had to ride over the Range, and out as far
as Goondiwindi, and found that, the trip would give him a good
idea of what his Immigrants would have to contend with in the
shape of hardships of every description. He had often to sleep
o i a sheet of bark, with a sheep skin for a bed, and damper and
salt beef for his meals. He soon discovered that, there was more
to learn than passing examinations in High Schools and Colleges, to
develop the resources of a new country like Australia. He ac-
quired a great amount of valuable information during his trip, which
proved to him, that the practical man had wisdom at his back, in-
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


stead of theory. Being an honourable man, Dr. Lang made many
friends amongst the squatters as he travelled through the country,
and began to appreciate what they had to contend with. As a re-
sult of this visit, he described Warwick “as occupying a beautiful
situation, and possessing all the requisites of a first class inland
colonial town, “including one of the finest climates imaginable.”
Dr. Lang could not be considered as being entirely sympathetic
towards the squatters, because he thought it was only waste of time
growing wool, instead of settling the best class of immigrants from
the United Kingdom and Germany, with a view to agriculture, par-
ticularly the cultivation of cotton.
On the 10th December, 1859 the Separationists won the day, and
the New Colony called Queensland was gazetted. For many years
after the doctor’s visit, wool was the staple product, but, in the
middle sixties, during the American Civil War, cotton was suc-
cessfully grown in the Warwick district, owing to the Government
paying a bonus of £3 per ton. At the conclusion of the War, and
after the withdrawal of the bonus, cotton growing died out on the
Darling Downs. Now, however, it seems that Dr. Lang’s prophesy
will be verified before long, and that wool growing will have given
place to the onslaught of cultivation and dairying.
With the new impulse given to the young State, it soon began to
work for elbow room, so as to become a primary producer. The
authorities gave their attention to the cultivation of the land, and
the infant town of Warwick was soon to feel the effects of that
policy.
Municipal Progress.
Although the town had been gazetted as formed in 1849, and
the first sales of allotments took place in 1850, it remained dormant
except for a few bark huts built on the fringe of that part known
as the “Flat” until Separation. In the meantime, the arriving set-
ters including men who had seen the advantages emanating from
municipal town government in the countries of the’r birth. Natur-
ally they took an interest in the land of their adoption, and assisted
by their fellow townsmen, made an advance forward, which culmin-
ated in the formation of the Municipal Council in 1861.

THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


Street Improvements, Bridges, Etc.
With the foundation of the Council the £lOO loaned by the
first Aldermen was expended in clearing tracks through what were
to became Warwick’s present day streets. The question of bridges
to cross the Condamine had also to be taken in hand. Warwick’s
first bridge was built by Patrick and George Leslie at East War-
wick, and was called Murphy’s Bridge, after the Canning Downs
empolyee who lived close to the slip-rails there. This bridge was
a little above the present day Grafton-street bridge, and gave an
entrance to what was until recently, Mr. Dan Connolly’s lucerne
paddock. Another bridge was that over Rosenthal Creek at the
foot of Blades Hill, which was on the main southern road to New
South Wales. Two more bridges, low level, were put over the
Condamine at Mill Hill, where the present day Victoria-street
Bridge was afterwards built. That spot, which is now the main
bed of the Condamine, was in the early days, the backwater, and
Dnly had water in it during floods. What is now the dried filled
up channel, had the deepest permanent water in the early days.
In 1872 the Railway Department erected the present bridge at this
spot, so as to give a better access to its terminus at what is now
Mill Hill.
In the early sixties the first Helene Street bridge was con-
structed, and was a great boon to all people living at the eastern
side of the town, who, up to this time had to cross round by the
old Mill Hill bridges, because the first ford known as Bowen’s
Bridge was closed after Messrs, John Bowen and Hugh O’Neil
bought the freehold of the land on either side in 1855.
Wattle Scented Warwick.
The first Municipal Council had to cut clearings through two
large wattle forests or scrubs. The smaller of these occupied prac-
tically the whole of the high ground at East Warwick facing the
Railway Station. The next scrub ran from the Convent and Hos-
pital down to the edge of the Presbyterian Church and the Ellin-
thorpe Flour Mill. In the winter time these trees were a picture,
and the perfume from them was delightful. I shall never forget
wattle scented Warwick.
Members of Parliament.
In the year 1851 we find the Northern representatives in the
New South Wales Legislative Council to be George Leslie and
Francis Bigg. Mr. George Leslie represented the Darling Downs
and Clarence, and Mr. George Bigge the coastal country.
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


Queensland’s First Parliament.
This was elected in 1860, and consisted of 26 members, the
Darling Downs electorates returning six members, Warwick’s first
member was St. George R. Gore, who under R. G. W. Herbert, be-
came Secretary of Lands and Works in the first Ministry. In con-
gesting the election, St. George R. Gore had Arnold W'ienholt as his
opponent, and the result of the polling was:
Gore 71
Wienholt 58
This was a fitting reward for a pioneer who came to thfc
Downs in 1842, and resided at Yandilla with his brother. After
leaving there, Mr. Gore became the owner of Bodumba and Can-
ning Creek Stations, «in 1853, but his home, which he built, was
Lyndhurst, now the property of the McDougall family. Mr. Gore
held portfolios in two subsequent Ministries.
Lyndhurst was always in the lead as regards social matters.
Lady Gore and her charming daughters having entertained the
early Governors when visiting Warwick. Lady Bowen, on one
occasion was also a guest at Lyndhurst. St. George Gore passed
away at Lyndhurst in 1872. One daughter married Mr. Frank
Needham, of Canning Downs, and the other married Mr. John
Macansh, of Albilbah, and are survived by descendants in New
South Wales and Queensland. Mr. Fred Gore, a son, was for many
years interested in pastoral matters and business circles in the
Goondiwindi districts, where he recently died. Fred Gore was the
first Warwick boy to learn the mechanical engineering profession,
having been apprenticed to the Sydney firm of P, N. Russell Coy.
Mr. Fred Gore is survived by his widow and family.
Queensland’s First Governor.
Sir George Bowen paid his first official visit to Warwick in 1860,
having ridden over the Main Range on horseback, via the rough bridle
trachLthrough Cunningham’s Gap. Whatever exciting incidents hap-
pened in Warwick during election times, the old town could never be
honestly accused of disloyalty. The expected visit of Sir George had
put the people on their mettle, so as to give him a proper welcome,
and they decided to get as many horsemen as possible to form a
mounted escort to meet him, near what is now known as Sladevale. As
Sir George Bowen was an Irish gentleman, who had frequently fol-
lowed the fox hounds in his native land, a happy idea struck the Com-
mittee to ask the horseman to dress in the fox-hunting costume, viz.,
black cap, red coat, boots and breeches. In this they were successful,
and quite an imposing lot of splendid riders turned out in military
style. As the gay horsemen and one or two ladies —the latter gowned
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


Ip tight-fitting costumes, with black hats and blue veils, riding sine
saddle —dame down the sand hill, quite a wave of excitement went
through the sightseers. During the absence of the escort, Messrs,
Craig and Amies, who had charge of all arrangements in connection
with the salute, had organised an anvil battery in lieu of cannons.
The anvils were all charged with gunpowder, the wads being pegs of
wood driven home by sledge hammers, and weighed down by heavy
weights. As the Imposing cavalcade came into the town the salute
was fired in perfect time, with excellent effect, amidst the wildest ex-
citement. The citizens presented the Governor with the usual address
coudhed in the expressive style of that period. His Excellency, in
thanking them for the cordial welcome they had given him to their
‘'rich and beautiful” district, declared the mounted escort that met
him presented a spectactle “such as could be exhibited in only two
countries of the world —England and Australia.” He applauded the
“lovely scenery” and “delightful climate” of the district, and thus
laid the foundation of loyalty, which has always characterised War-
wick.
Church of England.
The Reverend Benjamin Glennie, a Church of England Clergyman,
was probably the first Clergyman to visit the Darling Downs. His
first service was held In the Horse and Jockey Public House owned
by Mr. John Collins. Mr. Glennie was attached to the Diocese of New-
castle. For a time his headquarters were at the Springs (Drayton).
Being a poor horseman, he did most of his travelling on foot, carrying
his wallet through rain and mud for some years. Many times he
walked backwards and forwards between Drayton and Warwick, at-
tending to the spiritual welfare of his flock at all places on the road.
He was a splendid man, the ideal good Christian, and a clean living
man. Persuasions did not bar him from seeing the good qualities of
his fellow beings, he was always delighted to consider everyone a per-
sonal friend. From the poor shepherd to the squatter, he was aa
esteemed visitor, and any one was delighted to show him hospitality.
Among his life-long friends were members of other denominations.
the Darling Downs Diocese had been divided he came to re-
side in Warwick, occupying the old home of Dr. Miles, which was
situated on the northern side of Deuchar’s Creek, now better known
as Rosenthal Creek. The Dr. Miles referred to was Warwick’ s first
Medico. Here the Rev. Mr. Glennie resided for some years, aftrwards
removing to the old Parsonage on the Waterworks Hill.
Before a Church had been built in Warwick, the first services
were held In the Horse and Jockey Public House, and afterwards in
the first Court House, which was a slab hut standing near the site of
the present Pound Yard and Show Buildings.
As Warwick progressed a wooden Church wan erected, in 1857,
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


where the present day Sunday School stands, and was named St.
Mark’s. To meet the ever increasing demand for room, the stone
building now used was finally built by the aid of generous subscrip-
tions, and opened by the Archdeacon Glennie in 1868.
Among other journeys made by this fine man, was when he
walked from Warwick to Brisbane to induct the first Anglican Bishop.
Dr. Tuffnell. After he had grown into years, and the severe trials of
pioneering Christianity began to leave their impression on a weaken-
ing constitution, was promoted to the city of Brisbane Diocese, as
a Canon, where he eventually passed away. The church that had the
honour of his services can congratulate itself upon having had such a
genuine Christian in its ministry.
The Church of England was most fortunate in having a fine lot
of young curates at different times to assist their chief. These in-
cluded the Rev. T. Jones (not the Canon of after years), Revs, Clay-
ton, Danvers and James Matthews. The latter married a Miss Mar-
getts of Warwick, and afterwards became Canon Matthews. A son of
theirs holds a high and responsible position in the National Bank at
Brisbane, The Rev, Mr. Boking was here also, and was afterwards
the clergyman who attended the notorious T. J. Griffin during his last
moments, ere he was executed for the murder of the Police Troopers
who weie in charge of the Bank Escort at the Mackenzie River, in
November 1867,
Presbyterian.
The first clergyman to conduct services in connection with this
Church was the Rev. Thomas Kingsford, who we find was here in
1851. In those days, it was quite the correct thing for the Protestant
Clergy to have a trade, and Mr. Kingsford had that of a blacksmith,
while his friend, the Rev, B. Glennie, was a compositor. The old
Court House (slab bumpy) also served to enable the Presbyterian ser-
vices to be conducted until such time as the first Church was erected
in 1858. Before this Church was built, Sunday Schocl was held in the
Rev, Mr. Kingsford’s private house by Miss Kingsford, and the writer
was one of her scholars. The first wooden Churcfii was built by Peter
Russell, assisted by John Hoyle. For many years Mr. Kingsford
gradually built up the membership of the Church and successfully
carried out its ministrations until the hand of time, who spares no
one, compelled him to retire with honour. The clergyman referred
to was the Grandfather of Warwick’s present Town Clerk. Following
the Rev. Mr. Kingsford came the Rev. Colin McCulloch fresh from the
highest educational establishments of Bonnie Scotland. This clergy-
man had grasped his educational opportunities, and stood out in the
community, at that time, as one of the most highly educated clergy-
men ( f the State.
The Rev. C, McCulloch afterwards lived for some years at
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


Rohama, Swan Creek, part of which, in recent years has been cut up
into town, allotments, on which the progressive town of Yangan now
stands.
During the ministrations of Mr. McCulloch, the present day hand-
some stone church was built in the early sixties, the contractor beiug
the late Mr. John McCulloch.
Methodist.
Here we get an appropriate designation of one of the leading sec-
tions of the Protestant community, judging by my earliest recollections
of the Warwick district, and the methodical manner the few adherents
of that persuasion kept the functions of their church alive at the time
I remember it first. The clergyman then was the Rev. Mr. Fiddler
who, conducted the services in a little wooden church, which stood
opposite the Northern Square in Victoria-street. In harking back to
those days, I find myself thinking about the energy and devotion of
the Clergy of all denominations at that period, in the trials and hard-
ships they had to go through so as to keep the flickering light of
Christianity burning. It could not have been for the greed of money,
because there was very little use for the “mammon of unrighteous-
ness, ” neither was there any luxurious use for it in the district then,
so I am convinced it was the love of the tasks they had undertaken
for the betterment of humanity. The next I remember was the Rev.
Mr. Wilson, who was a brother of Mrs. T, A. Johnson. Following those
mentioned, I recollect the Revs. Wilkins and Wiles, all of whom helped
to place this congregation on a firmer foundation, where it rested for
a year or two. After this, the Revs. Midgley and Taylor revitalised it,
and from that time foreward, that Church has never once looked back
until now we find the adherents of Methodism carrying on their ser-
vices in an up-to-date building, surrounded by all of the comforts and
conveniences of civilisation,.
Roman Catholic.
The first priest to look after the spiritual requirements of the
Roman Catholic residents in the Warwick end of the Darling Downs
was Father M'Ginty. This energetic priest saved himself no bodily or
mental rest in his efforts to keep in touch with the members of his
flock, which had to be done on foot or on horseback. He held his first
services at the Horse and Jockey Public House at the end of 1854,
and for some time in the old Court House. Following him was Dr.
Oani, an Italian priest, who took a very prominent part in assisting
the members of his communion to acquire land and homes in the dis-
trict, with much success. The present Church was built in his time.
His presbytery was the building erected by Dr. Sasche at the western
end of Fitzroy-street, overlooking the Condamiue. Dr. Cani afterwards
became Bishop of Rockhampton. He was succeeded by Father

■ ace. Father M Donough remained in Warwick for some years and
then took over the Clermont diocese, where he passed away.
Banking.
iere was no Bank at Warwick in the early days. All money, which
e nested ° f paper money, such as notes, orders and cheques, had to be
s tto Brisbane. Silver and gold at that time were extremely scarce.
WMT L ° T n° Leslle Was the Banker for the station people, and Mr.
William Craig for the townspeople. These fine pioneers, it will be
seen, had the confidence of the residents. They held the money until
some reliable person whom they could trust to bank it, was going to
Brisbane. These couriers rode through t o Ipswich in the on e day, 84
mi es, caving Warwick at 3 a.m,, they crossed the range, and after-
wards gave their horses two hours’ rest, a feed and drink, during the
hottest part of the day, which freshened them up for the remaining
42 miles.
Q , I AS T _ > th ° distrxct progressed after Separation, the Australian Joint
Stock Bank established a branch in Albion-street, near Mr. Patrick
Fleming’s Downs Hotel, in Bcrkman’s brick store, the manager being
Mr. Jackson. This was a long-felt want, and gave the business the
stability it required. On the death of Mr. Jackson, Mr. J. E. Eoss took
charge as manager. A nice stone building erected by Mr. J. C. White
Police Magistrate, at the corner of Fitzroy and Palmerin streets, was
acquired by this Bank, and it became the banking chambers. This
building, which is now the Australian Bank of Commerce, represented
the only bank in Warwick for many years.
In the sixties the Bank of New South Wales opened a branch, rent-
ing what had been Mr. Fred. Hudson’s Queen’s Hotel in Fitzroy-
atreet, where a fine business was carried on for years. Its first man-
ager was Mr. William Thompson, who had previously been a squatter near
Ballandean. The Accountant was Mr. Hawthorne, who was succeeded
by Mr, Blair Kerr. This bank afterwards bought the premises where
Mr. J. J. Kingsford had his General Store, opposite the Australian
Bank of Commerce, where it erected the present up-to-date building.
These two banks enabled the town and district to expand their
business, and filled all requirements until recent years.
Medical Men.
The first medical men to practice in Warwick were Dr. Miles Dr
Labatt and Dr. Sasche. The former’s son, Mr. C. S. Miles, has
recently retired from the general managership of the State Savings
Bank, at Brisbane, while Dr, Labatt has descendants in the Warwick
district. Dr. Miles was amongst those who purchased land at War-
wick’s first land sale, on which he built a nice brick house. This was
situated near the bridge over Rosenthal Creek, facing the main road
to the South, where it is still to be seen. Later on, when returning from
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


a professional visit in the Inglewood district, he was thrown from hig
horse and killed.
Dr. Labatt followed Dr. Miles, and also lived in the same locality
at Rosenthal Creek. His residence was called “Canning Lodge.” While
here, he had the honour of entertaining the Governor of New South
Wales, Sir Charles Fitzroy, on his visit to Warwick in April, 1854.
Dr. Labatt was related to a very old Irish aristocratic family, and i#
survived by two daughters and several grandchildren.
Dr. Sasche came a little later and built his residence at the corner
of Fitzroy and Wantley streets, but did not remain long, as he re-
moved to Toowoomba.
Later, followed Dr. S. W. Aldred, who had his residence and rooms
in Victoria-street, and afterwards in Palmerin-street, where Mr. M.
B, Daveney’s office is. He was a prominent man in public matters
while residing in Warwick, and married Miss Hay, a daughter of Mr.
James Hay, one time owner of Maryvale, and afterwards overseer at
Canning Downs. Dr. Lucas, who was a very clever physician, came at
this time, but did not remain long.
Dr. Margetts was another good all round medico, who arrived in
the sixties with a fine family, and took up his residence in the build-
ing at the corner of Albion and Fitzroy streets, where he had a large
practice, and was greatly respected. He is survived by many de-
scendants in the district.
Dr. Balls-Headley, M.A., M.D., Cantab, fresh from England, came
close upon the heels of Dr. Margetts, and had his surgery and resi-
dence next door to the latter’s home. He afterwards removed to
Melbourne. Dr. Balls-Headley was a brother of Mr. William Carter
Balls, who was cattle overseer at Canning Downs, and afterwards a
prominent business man in Warwick. As the M.A., M.D., Cantab
was not understood by many of the early day residents, I remember
it caused a lot of curiosity, which was afterwards explained as mean-
ing, Master of Arts and Medical Doctor from Cambridge University.
Lawyers.
The legal profession had the honour of having Mr. John Oxen-
ham as its first lawyer, who built and resided in the fine stone house
which has recently been absorbed by the Scots College, and of which
it now forms part. Mr, Oxenham had a large family, who are, with
their descendants scattered over Australia.
Mr. John Conquest came next, and he is survived by descend-
ants in the State.
Mr. Addenbrooke arrived soon after Mr. Conquest, and resided
in Warwick many years, afterwards retiring with his family to Eng-
land.
Mr. Fuller was another of Warwick’s old legal men, and was.
well known as a wrangler in Police Court matters.
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


Blacksmiths and Wheelwrights.
As already mentioned, Dan Emming was Warwick’s first black-
smith. Then came the Craig family, who have already been refer-
red to as some of Warwick’s progressive citizens.
Another fine citizen was Mr. Thomas Amies, who arrived in 1847,
and always had a reputation of being one of Warwick’s best far-
riers. His business premises were in Victoria-street, facing the pre-
sent day Technical College. Like the Craig family, he is also rep-
resented by many descendants.
The Craig family were succeeded by Messrs. J. Ferguson and J.
Fenwick in their old premises, who did much to uphold the reputa-
tion of their predecessors. Mr. Henry Borger, another good black-
smith, also opened a shop in Fitzroy-street. Later on came Mr.
John McEniery, another champion horse sheer, who is survived by
sons carrying on their father’s business The late Mr. Harry Hough-
ton was a fine all round blacksmith, and is ably represented by his
son.
General Stores.
With the expansion of commerce, the original business places
were too small. Mr. Walker’s bark store had to give place to a
nice up-to-date wooden building, which after being opened, was sold
to Mr. Simon Mayer, who later on, disposed of it to Messrs. Horwitz
Bros. This firm then built the stone store at the corner of Pal-
merin and Fuzroy streets, which was called the Exchange Store. Mr.
Jacob Horwitz was Warwick’s member at one time, and made a very
liberal bequest to the Warwick Hospital quite recently. In the
meantime Mr. J. J. Kingsford established a fine General Store where
the Bank of New South Wales now stands. This was the prin-
cipal business place for years. Mr. Kingsford is survived by many
descendants.
Mr. W. H. Brown had a nice General Store at the corner of
Albert and Albion streets, called the Beehive Stores. For a time
his store was also Warwick’s second Post OiTice. Later on, when
the railway arrived at Warwick, Mr, Brown became second station
master. He is survived by many descendants around Brisbane.
With W. Spreadborough and William Craig, he was the originator
of the Eastern Downs Society. The “Emporium,” under the man-
agership of E. Marwedel, then came to light, and was always a
busy centre for business, as it was connected with the Ellenthorpe
Steam Flour Mill as regards ownership. This store had employees
who afterwards became some of Warwick’s principal business men,
one of whom was the late Mr. T. A. Johnson.
Further up Palmerin Street, nearly opposite the Technical Col-
lege, Messrs. Davis, Harris and Co. had a fine General Store, but this

building has vanished, and the owners, with their families, left
Warwick.
In Fitzroy Street, facing the Queen’s Hotel, Mr. Charles Gilm,
the German baker, had a well stocked General Store, where almost
anything could be purchased for cash —no booking permitted.
Next door Mr. David Clarke had a small store, which com-
prised a good seedman’s section, and I recollect that an apprentice
there has since become the senior partner in one of Warwick’s larg-
est business establishments. Mr. David Clark was also a Chemist
and Druggist. Mr. R, Gill, formerly of Tenterfield, had a large
store where the Royal Hotel now stands, and was a fine business
man. Mr. Gill is survived by a son prominent in business circles
of the Metropolis, also by a daughter in Stanthorpe.
Carpenters and Builders.
The first carpenters and builders were George Furness, John
Kniblock, William Craig, William Marshall, Samuel Evenden, Ned
Anderson, F. Zwoerner, G. Rowlings and John Thompson, all of
whom took a very prominent part in helping the early settlers to
have comfortable houses. Kniblock was a good tradesman, and
with Furness and Anderson, built most of the buildings on Canning
Downs. Most of the above are represented by descendants in the
district at the present day.
Post and Telegraph Officers.
The first Post Office was opened as a receiving post, in the
Horse and Jockey Inn. Prom here it was transferred to Mr. W. H.
Brown’s store at the corner of Albion and Albert Streets. At this
period the Telegraph Office was a separate Office, the first one being
installed in a building in Albion Street, where Mr. O’Connor re-
sided of recent years. The officer in charge was Mr. Towell, and
his line repairer was Mr. Smith, who married a Miss Kingsford.
Mr. Towell afterwards became Telegraph Master at Ipswich.
As business expanded, a new stone building was erected in
Albion Street, opposite Mr. Flitcfort’s factory. This building saw
the amalgamation of both branches, and came under the manage-
ment of Mr. S. Marshall, who had Mr. Frederick Woods as assistant
and letter carrier. From here, owing to this part of the town being
subject to heavy floods, new premises were erected at the corner
of Palmerin and Grafton Streets, which now serve the requirements
of the public.
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


Chemists and Druggists.
The first Chemist and Druggist was Mr. Thomas Symes, who
opened a very nice shop in Victoria-street, opposite the Commercial
Hotel. Mr. Woolcot then took over the shop from Mr. Symes, and.
carried it on with great success. After retiring from business, Mr.
Woolcot handed over to Mr. R. M. Barnes, who then opened a new
shop near the Australian Bank of Commerce. One of Mr. Barnes’*
daughters married Mr. Horace C. Ransome, while a second married
Mr, Maddock. A son, Mr, W. W. Barnes, is in business at Too
woomba. The wife of Mr. R. M. Barnes was a cousin of the British
Admiral, Lord Nelson.
Boot and Shoe Makers.
Warwick’s first bootmaker was Mr. John Bowen, who was suc-
ceeded by Mr. Richard Murphy, an employee at Canning Downs, His
shop was a slab hut at the comer of Mr. Dan Connolly’s present day
hay shed on the Condamine River near Grafton Street. Then followed
Jimmy White who had his shop near the present day Australian
Hotel. Mr. Thomas Drohan commenced business in Palmerin Street,
and is survived by Miss Drohan of Warwick, and Mr. A. Drohan of
Toowoomba,. After this Messrs. Brown Bros, opened a shop in Albion
Street, and soon afterwards Mr. Isambert commenced business.
Saddle and Harness Maker.
As already stated Mr. Alex, Wagner was the first Saddle and Har-
ness Maker in Warwick. Mr. William Kluge came next, and had his
shop next door to the chemists in Victoria Street. This fine citizen
had a large business, and is represened by sons in Charters Towers,
who also established a fine saddlery business there. After this, Mr.
Peter Hoffman commenced in Palmerin Street, and Mr. Joseph Myers
had a nice shop in Fitzroy Street. Mr. Christopher Bath then formed
an up-to-date saddlery establishment in Palmerin Street.
Plumbers and Tinsmiths.
Mr. A. Gerish was Warwick’s first tinsmith, and with the advent
of the railway, enlarged his business to that of Plumber, which be-
came a large one owing to the demand for iron for roofing and spout-
ing on all new buildings. The old method of using shingles then
died out. Mr. Dobson was also a prominent man in this business.
Education.
For many years after the first settlers arrived in the Warwick
district and their families began to grow up, the need of schools was
severely felt To meet that difficulty, the squatters who could afford
the expense, had a tutor or governess in residence at their stations.
At Warroo, for instance, the private tutor was Mr. Francis Kates, at
a salary of £2OO per annum, with other privileges. This gentleman
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


afterwards went into business at Allora, with great success, and then
became the Parliamentary representative for the Dai ling Downs.
Many parents who could not afford a private tutor, or were unable
to send their sons to the Ipswich Grammar School, had to impart the
first rudiments of learning to their children. As settlement pro-
gressed, the first private mixed school in Warwick was opened by a
Mr. Lewis, in the second shepherd’s hut built by George Leslie, viz.,
at Jews Retreat,” which building Mr. Leslie allotted for that pur-
pose. This was a boon to the mothers, for which they had been
longing for years. The hut stood close to the site of Mr. Montcrieff
Scott’s present residence, near the junction of Rosenthal Creek.
Among the first scholars to attend here were the Lockes, M'lnnes,
Lemmings, Thompsons, Craigs, Summers. Weightmans, Robinsons]
Muidochs, Burnetts, Spreadboroughs and McNamaras. Following this
came the establishment of the first school, by the Board of National
Education, on Allotment 1 of Section 17, sold on October 25th, 1850, at
a rental of 1/ per annum. This is the ground on which the East
Warwick School now stands. The first master here was Mr. Jonathan
Harris, who also had the privilege of taking scholars as private
boarders, his charge being £65 per annum each. This school practic-
ally absorbed all of Mr. Lewis’ scholars. Among the first boarders
were Ralph and Alexander Reid, William Collins, my brother George
and myself.
The day scholars had to pay a nominal sum per week. Following
Mr Harris was a Mr. McDongall, who, however, did not remain long.
Then came Mr, J. S. Kerr, who was a very strict, but fine teacher,
and many residents of this State owe most of what they learned at
school to this practical conscientious teacher. By this time the new
brick building was completed, and divided into a Boys’ and Girls’
school, by a wooden partition. Up to the completion of this building
the school was a mixed one. Miss Condren then took charge of the
first Girls’ school, and the National school became the principal edu-
cational centre at Warwick. Prior to Mr. Kerr’s arrival there were
two private schools in Warwick, viz., Mr. Archibald Stewart’s, where
Dr. Wolfgang Hunt’s residence new stands. After this Mr. J. H. Nich-
olson had a fair sized school on the Sandy Creek road. Among the
scholars here were the Gores of Lyndhurst, Morgans of Summerhill,
John Cox and his cousin William from the Pooket. Nearer town came
the Allens and Longwills, all of whom afterwards joined the National
school, under Mr. J. S. Kerr, One of the first Inspectors to visit the
school was Mr. Randal Macdonnell, Mr. J. G. Anderson following.
When Charles Lilley’s Government cut out Scripture lessons from the
National Schools, the Church of England and Roman Catholic de-
nominations established schools of their own, but the former eventu-
ally closed their establishment, which was conducted by Mr. D. Des-
bois. The latter, however, kept their schools open, and these are

now represented by the Convent and Christian Brothers’ up-to-date
establishments. With the increase of settlement the Slate had to pro-
vide ?nore accommodation, and their compulsory Act now became effec-
tive, and the Warwick West Schools were built in the eighties. Re-
cognising the salubrious and healthy climate of Warwick, and its
genial surroundings, with easy access by rail, thoughtful members of
the community at once made a move towards making the town an
educational centre of the first rank. Then came the Technical Col-
lege as a secondary stage for higher education, made possible by the
liberal encouragement of the Department of Public Instruction to
primary scholars. Now we find a series of quick responses by the
Reman Catholic, Presbyterian and Church of England communions,
with their colleges, until Warwick stands out as an advanced educa-
tional centre, for the State’s future male and female population, to
finish off with the University if they so wish. Thus we find that the
humble shepherd’s slab hut of the early fifties surrounded by the
wattle scented groves, has given place to educational conveniences,
from the Kindergarten, ascending, by easy steps, to the landing of
Queensland’s University.
Lands Department—Early Settlement.
Fixity of tenure was a great bugbear to the early squatters be-
cause the majority of the holdings on the Darling Downs were
acquired prior to separation, on the payment of £lO, which gave
the holder a license to take up not more than 30,000 acres for that
sum. The first methods of selection were of a casual kind —Squat-
ters would apply for various tracts of country which were very
often chosen from some commanding position, with the horizon as
the boundary. These claims would be registered and recognised,
and possibly no survey made for years after. Later on, in 1847, the
New South Wales Government allowed squatters to use what was
called a pre-emptive right, which gave them power to take up, with
priority, 15,000 acres of the best land on their run, so as to con-
solidate it. Many of the stations used this right. Warwick was
surveyed, and the first land was sold by the New South Wales Gov-
ernment. Later on, after Separation, this land had to be brought
under Queensland’s Real Property Act, and caused considerable
trouble and delay in many instances, before this was effected. Subse-
quent sales were under the Queensland Act.
On December TOth, 1859, Queensland became a State, and
passed its first Lands Act on September 18th, 1860, which was to
regulate the occupation of Crown Lands in the unsettled districts.
The area of each run was to be not less than 25 square miles, and
not more than 100 square miles, and to be rectangular in form.
About this time, an innovation was made by the Lands Department,
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.

who provided a large area of agricultural land in 1863, comprising
part of the holdings of Canning Downs and Glengallan, on Swan
Creek and Campbell’s Gully. This area became known as the
Agricultural Reserve, and played a very important part in the subse-
quent agricultural advancement of Warwick, as at was taken up by
»uch a number of sterling colonists. Then, in 1868 another Act was
introduced, and it was the first real attempt to deal with closer
lettlement. It provided for acquiring freehold blocks up to 10,000
acres. Then there were smaller areas styled homesteads, consisting
of three classes, viz., agricultural land, first-class pastoral, and sec-
ond class pastoral land. Agricultural selections were not to be much
less than 40 acres, and not to exceed 640 acres. At this stage, we
find the terms “Selector” and “Selection” appearing for the first
time. This was certainly a good Act, and many of our most suc-
cessful residents received their first start by selecting under this
Act, and we see the results of their labour on the mountain scrubs
and elsewhere. Against this, however, was the abuse of dummying,
which many of the squatters worked to advantage, and by thii
means, acquired large freeholds. In 1884 Sir Samuel Griffith intro-
duced a bill to cut up some of the large leasehold runs, by resuming
a portion of each. The resumed parts were called Crown Lands,
and the other portions, the lessees could lease from 10 to 15 years,
with the provision that, the rentals for same were to be appraised
from time to time by a Land Board, which now comes on the scene
for the first time. 20,000 acre blocks now became the order of
the day. In 1894 the Agricultural Land Purchase Act was intro-
duced, which gave the Darling Downs its final kick off in Agricul-
ture. This practically brings us up to the recent introduction of
perpetual leasehold. This Act abolished the sale of Crown Lands,
substituting perpetual leaseholds, with the possibility of their rates
being increased from time to time by the State. This is now in its
experimental stage.
The first Lands Offiio In Warwick was in Albion Street, under
the supervision of Mr. McDowell. Then came Mr. Gumming, followed
by Mr. Carr-Boyd, with whom was associated Mr. W. Hanbury.
Many of the early immigrants were entitled to land orders,
which were presented by the State free. This gave the holder power
to take up a certain area of suburban land, or a larger one of
country land. At first these land orders were transferable, then
those squatters who had the money to buy them cheap, secured all
they could, and enlarged the freeholds of their run with them.
Later on, however, the orders were made non-transferable, and could
not be used by the squatters.
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


After this came the Volunteer Land Orders instituted by the
Queensland Government. These entitled the .volunteer who had
Served a certain number ot years in the ranks ti a s nail area ot
suburban land (10 acres), but 50 acres of country land could be
selected. As these orders were at first transferable, some of the
Darling Downs Stations quickly seized the opportunity of acquir-
ing them, thus consolidating the freehold of their runs. Among
stations who took advantage of this was Yandilla. However, the
authorities, on becoming aware of this, eventually squelched the
matter, and some holders of these orders still have them as a
legacy. One or two nice blocks in the celebrated Isis scrub were
secured under these orders.
Labour Conditions.
In the early fifties a great many changes took place on the Dar-
ling Downs. When the southern gold diggings broke out in 1851,
labour became very scarce, and the squatters had great difiiculty
in getting shearers and sheep washers. Every ablcbodied man went
to the diggings, the squatters, therefore, had to employ the blacks
to wash their sheep, which was done by standing in the water,
and for shepherding they had to procure any labour available. In
this way they were forced to put two flocks of sheep into one, mak-
ing a total of 3000. This caused the shepherds to grumble, and
often to become careless. Numbers of sheep were thus lost, which
gave the supers and overseers a lively time, because the dingoes fed
sumptuously on the squatters mutton, and scattered the sheep in all
directions. On one of these occasions I counted 90 dead sheep in
one camp. It was impossible to poison the dingoes, on account of
the shepherds dogs running the risk of getting the baits. At this
stage some of the squatters tried the experiment of getting labour
from China, and engaged agents there to send out Chinamen on a
two years agreement at £l2 per annum, and found, the squatters
paying their passages out to Australia. At first the chinamen work-
ed all right until they got to understand that they were not being
paid as liberally as the white workers. There were then 300 of
them on the Darling Downs looking after 450,500 sheep. The group
at Canning Downs became dissatisfied, and went on strike. This
was the first labour strike on the Darling Downs. These men came
into the station in a mob and took possession of the gardener’s hut
and all the vegetables they could lay their hands on. They went
up to the woolshed where the shearers had stacked their
castaway shears, took a pair each, broke the bows in the centre,
and carried a shear blade dn each hand. This was done at night.
No one had the slightest suspiciou they were going to show fight
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


until the following morning, when five of them came up from the
farm at daylight with the shear blades concealed beneath their
loose jackets, intending to attack the meat store. Mr. Hay, the
overseer, was in at the time, but had no idea they were going to
attack him, or he would not have given them the opportunity.
Tommy, King Blucher’s son, thwarted this, and the chinamen, furi-
ous at the treatment meted out to them by Hay and the black-
fellow, cleared off to the gardeners hut for reinforcements. In the
meantime Mr. Hay advised his master, Mr. George Leslie, of the
attack, and the latter summoned assistance, two of his stockmen.
Dale and Pomphrey, responding immediately on horseback. Others
quickly joined up, mounted, and with stockwhips in hand, advanced
towards the chows’ stronghold. Mr. Hay placed his men in am-
bush, and rode alone close to the stronghold, on an ambling horse.
The Chinamen, thinking his horse was lame, rushed out after him,
hoping to catch him, but directly they got clear of the hut the men
in ambush raced up. The Chows then turned, intending to put up
a fight, but the sight of Tommy, the blackfellow, with his spear,
nulla and boomerang, soon altered matters, and the Chows, drop-
ping their shear blades, ran for their lives. The horsemen rounded
them up like cattle and drove them into Warwick, where they were
handed over to Sergeant McEvoy. Half of them received short
sentences, while the others were sent back to the Station to work.
These men turned out good shepherds after that, and remained at
the station until their time expired. They also caught the gold
fever, and cleared away to the diggings. At the best, this labour
was unsatisfactory, and more expensive than white labour.
Wages and Labour.
When Warwick was first formed, the following was the rate of
wages:—
Stockmen £45 per annum.
Shepherds £3O per annum.
Hutkeepers £26 per annum
Men working at all kinds of work received from 12/ to 15/ per
week, and rations, the quantities of the latter being:—
Flour 10 lbs.
Beef 14 lbs.
Sugar .. 2 lbs.
Tea i lb.
Shearers 17/ per 100
THE EAHLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


Sheep Washing.
Washers, 6/ a day, and rations. The accommodation provided wag
the woolshed, with the possibility of annoyance from sheep ticks
crawling over those resting. If this was not acceptable then you were
at liberty to strip a few sheets of bark and make a gunyah outside.
It was a free country, and no one would interfere with you.
Bush Work.
Those accustomed to building huts, yards, or hurdle making, found
any amount of contract work for those lines, and made a comfortable
living at it.
Carrying.
This was the best way of making money when the weather per-
mitted, but during the rainy season was the very reverse. The
squatters very often provided teams for men they knew, and gave
them a chance to work them out. Many of the best residents made
good under these conditions. These were all bullock teams. Horse
teams had not then come on the scene. In wet weather the carriage
went up as high as 25/ per 100 lbs. In dry weather the trip to and
from Ipswich usually took from six to eight weeks, and much longer in
wet weather. After this the price came down to £3 per ton be-
tween Ipswich and Warwick.
As soon as Mr. John Collins had established himself at the Horse
and Jockey Hotel, the squatters made that place their main business
centre, and it was here, principally, that they obtained what labour
they required. Thus the Horse and Jockey Inn became Warwick’s first
Labour Bureau.
General.
As a rule, the squatters were very good to their employees and
allowed them certain latitude in dealing, as regards horses. In the
rush South to the goldfields, horses became valuable, and a large num-
ber of people left good positions, bought horses, and made South..
Many, of course came back in a few months, glad to get back to
their old places. A good looking broken in horse brought from £2O
to £35. The Chinamen caught the gold fever, and preferred to rid©
rather than walk. This gave the consistent horse breeders their op-
portunity of selling at good prices. It was very amusing to see the
antics of the Chinamen with the horses. A common sight was to see
one on either side holding the reins while the other fellow mounted.
If he succeeded in getting into the saddle, he usually grasped the pum-
mel with one hand, and the reins with the other, and stuck both heel*
into the sides of the horse. This started the horse bucking at once.
It was nothing unusual to see these Chinamen sprawling on the ground,
and the horse galloping about the poddock with the saddle on. Some
person would, later, run the horse into the yard for them, when the
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


Chinamen would catch the horse, put three swags on his back, and
lead him away. It was not uncommon for the horse to buck the swaga
off and come back to his run with the saddle and bridle on. Many a
stockman obtained a good cheap outfit in this way.
First Saw Mills.
The first dawn of the sawmilling industry made its appearance in
1855. At that time each squatter had a theory of his own, as many
have now, and was not satisfied until he put it into practice and lost
some money in his efforts to conserve water by a dam. Not one of
them, prior to 1855 was a practical engineer, and knew how to con-
struct a dam. In this year, Mr. Charles Mclntosh, senr., and my father,
Thomas Hall, took the levels for a Saw Mill about a mile and a half
below the old Killarney Cattle Station. At this time Gilbert and Walter
Davidson had bought Canning Downs. My father did not know either
of these gentlemen then. He drew out a proper plan, giving the
widths and height of the dam, the distance the water would have to
be taken to the water wheel, depth of the water race, and probable
cost of the whole proposition. At that period Mr. M'lntosh and my
father were employed by Mr. Broughton at Acacia Creek, and could
not get away, so they trusted a man named Mowat, who had been
working with Gilbert Davidson at Rosewood Station before he came
to Canning Downs. Mowat went to Canning Downs and showed the
plan to Davidson, who at once asked who drew it up. Gilbert David-
son was a Civil Engineer, and saw the plan "was drawn up by a
practical man. He told Mowat to send my father to him and he
would lease the place required for the Mill. Unfortunately Mowat
became so excited over the favourable turn events had taken that,
instead of going to Acacia Creek, he went to Warwick, and indulged
in the cup that cheers, from the effects of which it took him ten
days to recover. In consequence of the delay Mr. Davidson thought
that my father and his mate had abanoned the idea. Just then there
were two new* arrivals from Scotland named John and Peter Affleck,
working at Canning Downs at the farm, making wheels. John was
an engineer by profession, and Peter was a carpenter. Gilbert David-
son took the plan and showed it to them, whereupon they discussed the
whole business. Timber at that time wa 25/ per 100 feet, Davidson
advised the two brothers to go into the business, and they replied that
they had no cash, so he offered to finance them on my father’s esti-
mate, which was £IOOO, The Afflecks then went to Killarney, set to
work erecting the dam, and continued there for eighteen months. Dur-
ing that time their dam was carried away twice by floods. Dis-
heartened, they came to Gilbert Davidson to see what was best to bo
done. By this time, my father and Mr. M'lntosh happened to be at
Canning Downs. Davidson discovered my father was a surveyor, and
a practical mill wright, who had been accustomed to erecting dams and
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


water mills in Scotland, so lie introduced the Afflecks to my father.
As a result of this meeting Mr. M‘lntosh completed the work he and
my father had been engaged in, and the latter went to Killarney and
finished the dam. During its erection all the other works were being
pushed ahead, the machinery was fixed in quick time, and the mill
started without a hitch. In a week’s time from its starting, timber
was reduced from 25/ to 20/ per 100 feet. This mill had sufficient
power to drive four large circular saws, and it is questionable if there
is a mill on the Downs to-day to beat it. With sawn timber now avail-
able, a keen demand set in for new houses at Warwick. After work-
ing the mill for a considerable time, John Affleck rented the Glenmore
property at Upper Swan Creek in 1862. Here he established a new mill
and installed a steam engine to provide the working power. This mill was
kept going for years, the timber from which practically built most of
the important buildings in Warwick up to the seventies, also many of
the buildings at early Stanthorpe. The first saw mill erected in the
Warwick district was that owned and built by William Anderson at
Rosella Point, when he and Mr. John Deuchar were at Glengallan. This
mill with its equipment was sold to a Mr. Cocks, of Toowoomba, about
1859, and became Cocks’ saw and flour mill at the latter place, where
it worked for many years at the swamp below where the Foundry was
afterwards established. Another early saw mill was built and worked
by Messrs. Robertson and Gazzard, at the head of Swan Creek, This
mill cut a lot of cedar during the short time it was working.
Pit Sawyers.
For upwards of fifteen years, after the arrival of the Leslie
Bros, on the Darling Downs, most of the sawn timber used in
buildings was the result of the efforts of pit sawyers. These pits
were established close to the timber sources, and for soft timbers
were to be found on the edge of, and in the scrubs. Years after
the first saw mills came on the scene Cedar was cut by pit sawyers,
in many of the remote parts of the mountain range. Cedar was
used for furniture, partions and wainscoating in many of the early
buildings. Some of the first pit sawyers who took such a promin-
ent part in helping to house the first settlers were Joseph Russell,
Harry Kirby, I. Hemmings, James Craig, J. Chapman, M. Gillett, A.
Evans, C. Winks, Gipsy Cooper and Big Charlie.
Among the most prominent cedar pit sawyers of later years was
J. Chapman, who for a long time cut cedar in the recesses of the
mountain scrubs bordering Emu Creek. This man’s wife was a
very small woman. She always kept herself well dressed, neat and
clean, and from the stockmen of the district received the name of
Dolly Dolly, after the horse she rode. For several years Mr. and
Mrs. Chapman resided in seclusion near the spring at the foot of the
spur leading to the mountain tops at Emu Yale, in a dark recess
THE EARLY HISTORY OP WARWICK DISTRICT.


afterwards called Dolly’s Creek, by which name it is still known.
While living here, some of the best whiskey obtained at one of the
Warwick Hotels was said to have been distilled in this locality, from
maize, but it was always remarked, as a strange coincidence, that
after the departure of this couple from Dolly’s Creek, this favou-
rite but scarce spirit almost disappeared from Warwick’s list of
liquors.
Washpools.
The pioneer squatters were not long in discovering that the
cost of wool carriage by privately owned bullock teams, especially
in the grease, made a big hole in their earnings, particularly when
the clip went up to four or five hundred tons. At the rates paid
for hand washing then, provided water was available, and labour
sufficient, it was found more profitable to wash their clips by hand
and save a third of the cost by so doing. With this in view,
Messrs. Gilbert and Walter Davidson got my father to build a dam
close to Mr. Joseph Kay’s property. This served its purpose, al-
though in a small way. Later on Mr, J. D. McLean, of West-
brook. entered into an agreement with my father to build a dam
for him at Oakey Creek, also for a washpool on the same spot. This
dam was to throw the water back three miles, and had to be
100 yards wide, and level with the top of the banks. Great diffi-
culty was experienced here owing to false bottoms, but at a depth
of 12 feet a foundation was obtained, and the dam completed. That
happened in 1859, and the dam still remains there. Mr. John
Deuchar, part owner of Glengallan, then decided to build a dam and
washpool on Glengallan Creek, and engaged my father, his old
school mate, to carry out the work, knowing that he was a prac-
tical man. This was promptly undertaken and completed without
a hitch. After that, Rosenthal spent a lot of money on machinery
for sheep washing purposes, as an equipment of their washpool on
Sandy Creek.
Newspapers.
Although the ‘‘Darling Downs Gazette” was first published at
Drayton In June 1858, Warwick had no newspaper until the first issue
of the 4 ‘Warwick Mail” appeared. The publishing office was in a
building at the corner of Palmerin and Victoria Streets, which has
long since disappeared. The “Warwick Mail” had a very short life-
only a matter of a few months. In November, 1864, the “Warwick
Argus” was first published, which was edited and owned by Mr. Pat-
rick Pitchie. It afterwards passed into the hands of Mr. James Mor-
gan. In 1867 the “Examiner” first came on the scene. It was pub-
lished in a building in Albert Street, just round the corner from tho
old Emporium building. Its first Editor was a Mr. Mallileu. This
paper afterwards became the property of Messrs. Cowton and Irwin.
THE EAKLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


With two fine papers, Warwick stepped into the front rank and be-
came an up-to-date town, receiving all of the outside news promptly,
and recording interesting current events daily. Recently the above
papers joined forces, and became “The Warwick Dally News/' which
paper now caters for the people daily, and is a fine publication.
Agriculture.
The pioneers of the Darling Downs were quick to notice the extra-
ordinary fertility of this portion of Australia. Mr. Fred Bracker at
Rosenthal, and Mr. Neil Ross at Gladfleld, then the Hon. Peter Murray
at Canning Downs, whore he arrived in the latter forties with Mr.
William Leslie. When being shown over the run by Mr. George Les-
lie tfTey rested for a time on top of the hill overlooking old Killarney,
and the valley where the town of Killarney now stands.
The romantic wild scenery of this beautiful part of the Down*
charmed the visitors. George then asked; “What do you think of the
place?” The Hon. Peter Murray replied; “Well, George, this scenery
puts me much in mind of the scenery around Killarney in old Ireland.
George then said: ‘Well, Peter, in honour of you, it shall be called
Killarney. 5 ’ While standing here, the yells of the blackfellows could
be heard hunting after wallabies in the scrub not far away. Moving
from this part, the party crossed the Condamlne, unsaddled their
horses, boiled the quart pots, and had lunch. Murray, who had not
been in robust health, having been ordered away from Bonnie Scotland
for health reasons, now felt the invigorating effects of this salubriou*
climate. Lunch over, he picked up a stick, dug the soil along the
bank of the river, and going further up the side, dug more up. Re-
turning to the party, WTlliam Leslie greeted him with: “Well, Peter,
have you found any gold?” Peter replied; “There is good gold here;
this is the finest soil I have seen in all my travels, and I am
sure it would grow anything if it was properly tilled.” George said:
“If you think this land is of any use to you, you can have as much
as you like for farming purposes.” Peter thanked him for his kind
offer, and fixed on the spot where the late Mr. Thomas Lamb lived, at
the old Killarney Farm. The Hon. Peter Murray remained at Killar-
aey for a considerable time, where he grew wheat, maize and pota-
toes, also other grain. Being possessed of ample means, this farming
here proved successful as a hobby, and he became a strong, robust
man. He afterwards removed to the Western Downs. Following
closely in their steps came Mr. Herbert Evans, who had also seen
Murray’s efforts, and at once put his ideas into practice at the back
of the Racecourse, near Mile End.
Naturally the squatters did not care to press these advantage*
because free Immigration commenced in 1849, and they feared this
would weaken their holdings. This, however, could not be curbed for
long, because the New South Wales Government had commenced to

tell land at Warwick, and now we catch the first glimpse of our first
cultivators of the land, apart from those already mentioned. A« I
knew these men personally, a thrill of admiration passes through my
mind at the mention of their names. Commencing in 1852 and taking
at random in the following years, there were Thomas McEvoy, George
Leslie, Charles G. Miles, Edward Collins, William Spreadborough,
John Locke, William Carter, Michael Pender, William Hawker, John
Cox, Samuel Cox, A. H. McArthur, Fred Hudson, John Collins, Leslie
Bros., James Fitzgerald, William Duggan, William Craig, William Carr,
Martin Crane, Richard Watkinson, William Smith, James Morgan, S.
G. R Gore, Jeffries Bros., Michael McKone, Richard Burnett, W.
Schnitzerling, W. Wightman, Allan Mclnnes, George Thom and Tho-
mas Lamb.
The above purchased their land, or rented it, up to, and including
the year 1858. One year afterwards Separation from New South
Wale? was granted to Queensland. Then the new States Parliament
passed a Land Act in 1850, which was to give Warwick its first good
start in agriculture. This forward move afterwards caused an im-
mense expansion in the Importance of the rising town of Warwick,
creating new avenues of employment, and forming the nucleus of
many important Industries, also establishing stores and hotels. The
splendid class of settlers who arrived in this connection, left their im-
pression on the district for all time, their efforts vibrating in every
direction. These fine colonists practically helped to form our first
"yeomanry, and their descendants have assisted to carry on their
good work. This move' can be correctly termed the sectond stage of
the district’s progress, and included the following families; —Thomas
Robinson, P. Hoffman, Clark, Bloomfield, A. and G. Free, W. Tulloch,
J. Armstrong, T. Jackson, Bennett, Eastwell, W. Wilson, T. Kinsey,
J. Young, A. Watt, R. Woods. J. J. Kingsford, J. Craig, Smith, Cox,
Wilson Bros., Payne Bros., J. Doran, T. Hall, senr., H. Allen, August
Ehrens, B. Ross, Craig Bros., Kennedy, Walker, Dr, Canni, Murray,

Campbell, P. Murphy. P. McGucken, McGahan, J. Coll, T. Brewer, M.
Neviu, McConville, Wilson, G. Free, W. Eastwell, E. Eastwell, D. Con-
way, T. Hall, W. and A. Wilson, Hall Bros., G. Woods, J. McMahon,

Floury, Nichols, McDonald Bros., T. Bourke, Doyle, W. D. Lamb, J.
Kemp, Sleyer, and P. Morrisy. At the same time some nice farms
were made available at Allora, some of these being occupied by the
following:—S Gordon, W. Cook, J. Gallagher, Black, Shannon,
Scbriek, Graham, Erhart, Sparksman, Rooney, Anderson and Maher.
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


Wheat.
The first and most important crop cultivated in a large way was
wheat. As nothing reliable concerning a continuous planting of
this cereal was available, the first farmers relied upon the results
of Messrs. Niel Ross, Hon. Peter Murray and Herbert Evans, with
the softer kinds cf grain sown, viz., White Tuscan, While Llamas
and Purple Straw. At this stage, Mr. Charles Clark and Mr. James
McKeachie (formerly chief engineer on Prussia’s War Vessel “Bar-
borossa”) erected Warwick’s first Flour Mill on the Condamine
facing Wantley Street, in the early sixties, and named it “Ellin-
thorpe Steam Flour Mill,” Immense stones were used to grind the
grain, and excellent flour was produced. Later on, the seed wheat
hitherto grown, owing to changes in the climatic conditions, de-
veloped rust and smut. Then the pioneer farmers began to get set
backs, because the Mill could not turn out good flour with faulty
grain. Persevering, however, the farmers kept the stones grinding
for many years on the soft wheats, and the Mill could always dis-
pose of its good flour in the surrounding districts. Attached to the
Mill was a fine General Store, where the farmers could take out
goods as part payment for grain supplied. Further, the proprietors
were really the first people to introduce high-grade pigs to the
Warwick district. Afterwards these Berkshires were bred in yards
adjoining the property, and fed on the Mill offals, there being no
sale worth mentioning for these products. The pigs were sold to
the farmers and stations. Every year the surplus stock was turned
into hams and bacon, the bulk of which found its way to Ipswich
by bullock teams, under the supervision of Mr. James Sewell, no
railway being available at that time. Naturally, this Mill became
of immense help to the farmers at the very time they required
assistance, circulating large sums of money in the district for fire-
wood alone, also in wages. The Tannymorel coal then received its
first trial. Many of the pioneer families of the Warwick and other
districts were employed here, viz., Beatties, Smiths, Tuckers, Hack-
etts, Sewells, Kerwins, Mansfords, Evans, and Downings. The major-
ity of these families have descendants around Warwick and Too-
woomba, while the ancetor of the Kerwin family (now of Redbank
Plains, well known as coal mine owners there), got his first start
here. Such a high class of wheat was produced in the district that
Messrs, William Tulloch and Robert Armstrong, of the Swan Creek
Reserve, exhibited samples at the Paris Exhibition held at that
period and won everything with them, the variety being Talavera.
The Ellinthorpe Flour Mill afterwards passed into the hands
of Mr. Jacob Horwitz, who worked it successfully for many years.
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


and finally disposed of it to Messrs. Barnes and Co.
With the advent of rail communication and more up-to-date
machinery such as steel rollers, it was eventually pulled down, and
the present up-to-date Mill at the Warwick Railway Station erected
in its place.
Following up the efforts of these fine farmers, and benefiting
by their experience, other varieties of wheat were tried from year
to year, such as Steinwedel, introduced by Mr. Robert Armstrong,
and several varieties of spring wheat brought to Warwick by Mr.
MacDmgall, of Adelaide. All of these wheats proved a success, and
now the wheat crop is one of the standard industries of the War-
wick district.
At this period of the State’s existence, farming had to be car-
ried out with the most primitive implements, which included local
made wooden ploughs costing £l2 each; harrows from 6 to 8 feet
wide, by 5 feet. These were constructed of 3-inch heavy hardwood
with teeth varying from 7 to 9 inches long and 7-8 Inches thick.
As regards harvesting, our first crops were cut by sickles, at
from 25/ to 40/ per acre, and then stacked until thoroughly dry,
this being a most particular part of the harvest work, because all
wheat had to be thrashed by the flail. Later on Mr. P. Fleming
intorduced a horse-tread thrasher, which was considered a great im-
provement. The tread mill as it was called, drove a peg-toothed
drum, w'hich did splendid work. After this the grain passed through
a winnower and grader, which was worked by hand, before being
bagged ready for market. The price ranged from 5/ to 10/ per
bushel, with from 12/6 to 20/ per bushel for the first seed wheat
planted. At this time farm work was slow and laborious, as all
ploughing had to be done by bullocks, and it was some considerable
time before the farmers were able to breed or buy half bred
draughts. Horses at this period were very dear. The demand for
carriers in the west created a large sale for the best horses.
Alfalfa or Lucerne.
The cultivation of this splendid fodder plant was first tried in
the Warwick district by Mr. Fred Bracker, who was then in charge
of Rosenthal. Once again we are reminded of what the Darling
Downs owes to this practical pioneer. Mr. Bracker proved that this
plant was eminently suited for the Downs, although seed was not
available in any quantity. On the arrival at Warwick of Mr. David
Bugden, who built the first Criterion Hotel there, in writing home
to relatives in England, pointed out to them the disadvantage the
Warwick district was placed under, in not having an indigenous

reliable green fodder plant for winter feed, and casually mentioned
lucerne. Mr. Charles Gillam, the relative alluded to, together with
his family, were ready to leave for the Warwick district, so the
eldest son, Mr. William Gillam, before leaving Chichester, purchased
some lucerne seed. This seed was safely brought to Warwick ana
sown on the creek flat at the back of what is now “Ardendeuchar ”
This is the property the Gillam family first occupied when they
arrived as new chums in the early sixties. As a result some splen-
did Seed was secured and again planted at Collinsville, until the Gil-
lams had for sale. From this forward, lucerne wai

serve, by which time its value had been proved, and the Warwick
district then became the immense lucerne growing district of the
present day. In 1864 what was taken to be “dodder” appeared in
one oMh e old lucerne paddocks on the Rosenthal Estate. The Man-
ager, Mr. L E. Lester, gave orders to stack firewood, dead brush
or any other handy inflammable material on the effected portion,’
and urn it. This was done with wonderful success, as the rooted
Plants threw up fresh sprays without any sign of disease, and no
more trouble was experienced.
The following statistics will show what great strides have been
made since the first efforts of cultivation at Gladfield, Killarney and
Rosenthal. The close of the years 1919 and 1920 totalled:—
Wheat for 3919 and 1920 3,717,144 bushels.
B " Ie * 1920 317,511 bushels.
Maize, 1920 306,533 bushels.
Potatoes, 1920 2,673 tons
Canary Seed, 1920 24,751 bushels.
Millet Seed, 1920 6,431 bushel ,
Tobacco, 1920 57,842 lbs.
Orchards and Vineyards.
The majority of the large stations had very fine orchards, and can
Justly claim the Lcnour of having introduced vine cuttings and fruit tree*
to the Warwick district, comprising Canning Downs, Glengallan and
Rosenthal. Canning Downs received some fine vine cuttings from the
MacArthurs of Sydney, who were among the first colonists to import
the best vine cuttings to Australia. From here the vine spread over
the district, Mr. William Spreadborough of Norbiton, near Rosenthal,
being one of the earliest cultivators of same in his splendid garden!
Mr. Herbert Evans also had a fine garden at Mile End, while Dr. C.
S. Miles had a very fine orchard at his residence. The Canning Downs
garden was in charge of Mr. Jacob Kircher, and produced the highest
class fruit. Later on Mr, Kircher left Canning Downs, acquired land
at Sandy Creek, and built up the Assmanshausen wines, known all over
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


the State. Mr. St. George E. Gore, of Lyndhurst, had another excel-
lent garden, in charge of Mr. J. Sterling. The Glengallan garden was
«- very up-to-date one, and nothing pleased that fine old coloured em-
ployee, Le Porte, better, than to have this as he liked it, which was
a high standard. After this we find a wide expansion of the grape
vine industry, including the Sandy Creek areas, also at Glenmore and
Swan Creek, while there were many nice gardens in the town, among
these being Mr. Hawker’s. The fruit fly was practically unknown
(for many years, and when it did arrive, it was the late peach crop
that was affected. Nectarines were grown with great success at this
period, so were peaches, apricots, pears, plums, figs, and quinces. The
most robust grape was the Black Spanish. It was also the most pro-
fitable. Then came the White Syrian, Muscatells, Muscat of Alex-
andria and Black Hamburg.
With the opening up of the granite belt of recent years, we find
an immense expansion has taken place in the production from orchard#
and vineyards on the Darling Downs, and as a comparison, the totals
for the close of the years 1919 and 1920, the following are given;—
Grapes produced for 1919 and 1920 .. 834,459 lbs.
Oranges and lemons for 1919 and 1920 1,569 bushels.
Apples for 1919 and 1920 163,663 bushels.
Other fruits for 1920 124,502 bushels.
Cotton.
During the middle sixties, when the American Civil War was rag-
ing, and cotton growing in the Confederate States was temporarily
itopped, quite a boom in cotton growing took place in South Eastern
Queensland. This boom extended to the Warwick corner of the Darl-
ing Downs, where splendid cotton was grown in various parts, it being
protected by a Government bonus of £3 per ton. Machinery to press
the cotton into bales was installed at the old Hermitage Farm, by
Messrs. Armitstead and Parr, and for a time the industry was a suc-
cess. At the conclusion of the war, the American article once more
came on the market. The bonus was then withdrawn, and Queensland
cotton growing died out. While the industry was booming at Warwick,
the bales of cotton were carried over Spicer’s Gap by bullock and
horse teams to Ipswich, many of these teams belonging to the Ellin-
thorpe Steam Flour Mill. One of the finest crops produced was that
grown on 12 acres by Mr. Thomas Jackson, at Abbotsford, on the slope
of the hill leading down to the present day railway station of Swan
Greek. With modern conveniences for cultivation, and rail communi-
cation, practically from the farms to Brisbane, nothing should be al-
lowed to mar its intense cultivation, because the world’s demand can-
not be supplied at the present time, and payable prices are likely to
continue for many years to come. Apart from this the cotton plant i»

not so liable to disease as wheat; again, the seed is a most useful
fodder for stock, and for that reason w T Ould be invaluable in times of
drought. The oil from cotton seed is another splendid commercial
piodr.ct, and with suitable machinery installed on the Darling
Downs, these by-products would be available to the public at first
cost, with a ready sale at a time when the demand for winter feed
was keen.
Dairying.
With the advent of business people to the town, the first sus-
tained demand for dairy products appeared. At this stage of set-
tlement there were no dairy breeds of cattle in the district —they
were solely the beef breeds. The female descendants of Lord Rag-
lan, the imported Shorthorn at the head of the Rosenthal stud, gave
splendid results as rich milk producers, and anything with a strain
of Lord Raglan was quickly sought after and secured for the bene-
fit of the townspeople, although in a limited way. With the arrival
of newcomers, who settled on the land, came Warwick’s first butter,
which was made from cream skimmed from dishes of milk which had
been standing for hours. The cream was then churned in the old
fashioned wooden churns by hand. The wives of many early set-
tlers walked miles from Sandy Creek, the Pocket, Rosenthal Creek
and the Agricultural Reserve, carrying their baskets of butter made
in the above way, which reached town generally on a Saturday.
This butter was got up in tasty pats adorned with the imprint of a
cow or a swan. These pats promptly sold at 2/6 per lb., and were
a luxury, which most of the families had only once a week. Occa-
sionally, kegs of Irish salted butter arrived at the principal general
store. It also sold readily at 1/ per lb. During the winter months,
when butter was scarce, its place was taken, amongts many families,
by nice dripping, which was what the first school children had to
use on their lunches. Local made cheese then gradually came into
use, and was quite a luxury for years, until the frugal farmers’
Wives had acquired the art of producing a splendid product. Then
it was found in most rural homes at any time of the year, in much
the same way as preserves are now.
Here again the Stanthorpe population gave the farmers in the
Warwick district a demand for all the surplus butter they could
produce, which came as more grist to the mill for our early yeo-
menry. Still, dairy breeds of cattle were absent, as anything with a
bad colour was promptly killed off by the squatters, who could not
tolerate any blacks, brindles, blues or fawns among their herd.
In the eighties, the Government of the day gave the dairying
its first real start, by inaugurating a travelling dairy, which visited
the farming centres, and the instructor imparted information gratis.
Advantage was taken of this, and it was brought more up-to-date.
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


At the same time dairy breeds of cattle were brought up from the
South. Then the Jerseys, Ayrshires and Illawaras came on the
scene This can be considered as the foundation of the present day
industry on the Darling Downs, Mr. Hume Black being the Minister.
If a comparison could be made between the first dairy efforts
with those for the close of the year 1920, we find the following for
1920:
Butter produced • • • • 7,467,238 lbs.
Cheese 10,330,416 lbs.
Milk 24,570,607 gallons.
Gold.
In the middle fifties alluvial gold had been found at Tooloom,
and later on at Lucky Valley. The latter gold was purchased by
Mr. Marcus Berkman. It amounted to a fair number of ounces. At
the same time alluvial gold was also discovered at the junction of
Cullendore and Acacia Creeks, indicating that the precious metal was
not confined to a small area. In the sixties quite a rush set in to
the Canal and Talgai Areas, "where fair quantities of alluvial gold
was discovered, while some promising reefs were also found at Tal-
gai. Gold has always been worked in an intermittent way in the
last two areas, and at the present day fossickers still get nice patches
about Canal and Thanes Creeks. In the late sixties nice alluvial
gold was once more found at Lucky Valley, but was only payable
on the prospector’s claim, still the colours were found over a fairly
Wide area, including Lord John Swamp, where they can still be
found. One reef was discovered here, which promised to develop
into something good, but for some reason, possibly the crude methods
of the day, the Maid of Erin faded away for the time being at all
events. The cyaniding process was not known at that period, and
seeing that the copper veins intrude largely there among the quartz
reefs, it would scarcely have been a success.
Coal.
Although Allan Cunningham, when picking his way up Millar’s
Valley did not notice coal lying about amongst the flood drifts, it
was there all the same, and was quickly observed by those pioneers
who followed him. The same thing was noticed at Swan and Emu
Creeks, also at Farm Creek. At the latter place it stood out promin-
ently in an aboriginal bathing pool, which was known to we young
fellows as the “Coal Hole.” In passing, I should like to remark
that, there was some medicinal quality in this water, of immense
value to the young bloods of the aboriginal tribe, and in it they
would lie for an hour at a time, until cured of a sickness introduced
by white people.
The first coal in quantity was found at this spot, and now it
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


is the well known Tannymorel Coal Mine, which turns out a high
grade coal for Gas and Steam Engines. It sells readily, and is much
sought after by locomotive men for steaming purposes. It was first
tested at the old Ellinthorpe Steam Flour Mill, Warwick, in the
Sixties, but was not persevered with, because that mill used the
scrub ironwood as fuel.
The next mine for trial was that on the bank of Dalrymplo
Creek, owned by Messrs. Hutton and Brennan, from where the coal
had to be carted by teams to Hendon. It also was before its time
as a commercial success, and collapsed. That was in 1870. This
was quickly followed in 1871 by the Clifton Colliery, at Elphin-
stone on the S. and W. Railway line. Mr. A. Simpson, who was a
brother of Captain Simpson of Brisbane, was the owner, and he
worked it vigorously for a time, developing the coal beds, and laying
bare the immense seams of beautiful white pipe clay, A tip boy in
that mine afterwards became Mr. J, W. Hunter, the member for
Roma, and later, Agent-General for Queensland, Mr. Simpson was
up against vested interests, or something with the same power, be-
cause he could not induce the Railway Department to take his coal
in quantities for locomotive purposes. Outside this, there was no
demand. Butter and cheese factories had not come on the scene,
and saw mills provided wood fuel for themselves. Like his neigh-
bour at Dalrymple Creek, after spending anything up to £ 8000 in
wages, equipment, etc., the mine was closed, and has since provided
an immense reservoir for the grazing and farming property on which
it stands. Soon after this the Railway Locomotives, who were using
firewood for fuel, began to burn out farms, haystacks, etc., to such
an extent, that the Railway Commissioner was mulcted in heavy
damages, also legal expenses. As a result, he transformed his loco-
motives into coal burning engines, and used Ipswich coal. It waa
now too late, and the mortgage, unlike Herr Stinnes, his country-
man, considered coal too black, and the mine was closed. Mr. Fred
Morgan, of Warwick, then found nice coal on his property at Ab-
»
botsford, close to the Swan Creek Railway Station, but somehow it
never received a decent trial, and the coal is there still. Shortly
after the above efforts, coal was found by Mr. King on Gowrie, and
was vigorously developed. Then other owners adjacent to this pro-
perty also exploited their seams, and for years a large tonnage
was recovered. These seams were then abandoned for better ones
a little further west, at Oakey and Ballangowan, and they are busy
centres at the present time.
It Is certain that coal underlies the Darling Downs In huge quan-
tities at varying depths, and will become an asset of Immense value to
future generations.
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


Tin Ore.
When Allan Cunningham was returning from his discovery of the
Darling Downs, he passed through the centre of the stream tin de-
posits. camping there, and apparently did not notice this mineral be-
cause he has not mentioned the matter. Patrick Leslie and Ernest
Elphinstone Dalrymple also travelled through it, and chmped on
Quart Pot Creek; still neither of these say anything about seeing any
tin ore. Ihe Marsh family, who took up Maryland a few years later,
do net seem to have observed it on their run, neither did Mr. Bartholo-
mew Ross, who leased the present day Stanthorpe land from Mary-
land people, and built the “Quart Pot Creek” Hotel there. Mr. Rosa
resided here for some years, and was a keen observer, and a keen busi-
ness man, which makes it all the more surprising to those who knew
him.
In 1870 the public were aroused by the excitement, as a result of
stream tin having been discovered at Quart Pot Creek by a prospector
named Joseph Greer. An immediate rush of people from all over
Australia set in, and areas of land were pegged out by the newcomers
on all the gullies and creeks in the district, the maximum area being
40 acres. In one day 900 acres were applied for, and in a week's
time 4220 acres had been leased, on which £1279 had been paid for de-
posits. Many of these claims turned out immensely rich, especially
those in the beds of Quart Pot Creek and the Severn, and for a time,
one that I knew well, produced as high as one ton a day. Naturally,
Warwick benefitted immensely by this discovery, owing to the influx
of so many travellers and new arrivals passing through. Its sawmills
were immediately working at full pressure in their efforts to supply
building timber. The farmers who were fortunate enough to have
supplies of lucerne, could not turn it into hay and chaff quick enough
to overtake the demand, while those farmers who had surplus draught
horses, began carrying between Warwick and Stanthorpe. The discov-
ery of tin ore was a veritable godsend to the farmers, as the wheat
crop at that period had some bad set backs with rust, and something
else was required to stimulate the men on the land, which the tin ore)
did. The damand for maize for feeding purposes, on a large scale
also appeared, and this created another avenue of business for the
farmer, although the highest price paid was 1/10 per bushel. The sur-
plus cattle were readily bought up to feed the army of new arrivals,
so all things considered, the toilers on the land began to get back
something for their past efforts.
Blood Horses and Race Meetings.
Apart from tfte stations already referred to as breeders of thd
thoroughbred racing stock, the following residents were enthusiastic
breeders of the best stock for racing and staying powers: Thomac
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


McEvoy, John Collins, Patrick Fleming, William Carter, Robert Craig,
Burnett Bros,, Frederick Hudson, William Duggan, and Hugh O’Neil.
For a time John Collins had “The Don” and afterwards sold him to
Canning Downs. Patrick Fleming had “Bolivar, ” then “Eucalyp-
tus.” Both of these horses sired good stock, but the main difficulty
was to get well bred mares. Many of them came into the district
with stolen mobs, and of course without pedigrees. One of these wa«
Mr. McEvoy’s celebrated mare 33, whose pedigree was not known.
Some of the best local bred horses included “Whalebone/ ; “Creep-
ing Jenny,” “Van Tromp," “Eclipse,” “Charles I.” Playboy and ‘‘Ben
Bolt.” The first racecourse was on the flat, which was then vacant
land between what is now the Grafton Street bridge, near Canning
Downs, and the Helene Street bridge. The shortest race, the “Trial’'
Stakes of one mile, was looked upon as a flutter. Although the
“Hurry Scurry” was only a mile, it had to be run off in heats, which
meant that the winner and others had to race actually two miles. The
Maiden Plate was miles. The Hack hurdle race was for mile heatg
ever 3 hurdles, and the winner always had to race 2 miles. The prin-
cipal flat races ranged from 2 to 3 miles, while the chief hurdle race
was f. r 3 miles over 9 hurdles 4 feet high. For that time the prize
money was. large when compared with present day prizes and condi-
tions. The best horses of those days came from what is now New
South Wales. The first meetings were for one day only, and that, wau
Boxing Day. This was the event of the*year, and every one for milea
around gathered for this meeting. In after years, as settlement in-
creased, the days were extended to two at mid-winter, and at the
same time the distances were shortened, and the number of rades in-
creased. By this time old Toongooroo, of the Aborigines, had been
allotted a racecourse reserve, and the race meetings have been held
there ever since. At first the prizes, with the honour of winning with
their own horses, were what the racing people were anxious to ob-
tain. Betting had not become part of this sport, neither had the
hocussing of the animals, or crooked riding. The first indication of
these came in the trail of an Imported jockey, who had a great repu-
tation as a hors* man, and he was blamed for showing them “Lon-
don.” The first happening of the day was with this rider on “Zanco,”
for the Trial Stakes. Zanco ran about 100 yards and practically fell
ovei, but the jockey escaped. Some racing men were loud In declar-
ing that Zanco had been dosed. This reached the ears of the public
on the course, and as soon as they understood what dosing meant,
acme of them put It down to the jockey and hi* retinue already men-
tioned. Later on in the day, this jockey rode a horse belonging to
Larry Flannery, a certain winner, the public thought, as also did
Larry; however, the horse ran second. Directly the riders were
weighed in numbers of the public rushed the grandstand fence, tore
off palings, and made a raid on the jockey, who, to avoid massacre,

dodged through the crowd, colours up, but was brought to bay behind
one of the booths, and received several blows from lemonade bottles,
ere the policle arrived and saved him from death. The police got him
off the course then, and he vanished from Warwick, not relishing the
short cuts of the Warwick sports, which were not what he had been
accustomed to at Epsom.
A Queensland jockey named Easton was blamed, at this time, for
acquiring the same habit as his English acquaintance, and was in-
troduced to the order of the ironbark paling.
At all of the early meetings admission to the course for everyone
including horses and vehicles, was free, so under those circumstances
it is not surprising that these meetings were well attended, and the
booth and stall holders did good business. In between the programme
races, the racing track was taken possession of by the public who
wished to give their horses a trial. These trials caused more merri-
ment and fun than all of the other events put together, because there
was such variety of animals and horsemanship, all tending to make
the programme a continuous one.
One of Warwick’s distinguished visitors at a prominent race
meeting in the sixties was Fred Ward, alias Thunderbolt, the bush-
ranger, and his youthful companion Willie. These two had just fin-
ished a successful shearing tour in Southern Queensland, and while
waiting for some storm clouds tc roll by, rusticated at Drayton, as
visiting shearers. Arriving a few days before the meeting at War-
wick they camped on the Southern side of the Condamine opposite
the racecourse, and witnessed the meeting. Thunderbolt saw “Min-
strel,” the Maryland horse, owned by Nicholas Hart, win the big
money. His friend ‘‘Billy Billy” of Tenterfield was also there. This
stockman happened to he working for a prominent butcher of that
town just then. W 7 happened Thunderbolt did not interfere
with Hart on his return to Maryland, but after “Minstrel” won tbe
big money at Tenterfield, a week or so afterwards, he bailed up Hart
at Boonoo Boonoo, and secured the whole of the money.
Prominent early day jockeys were George O’Donnell, Con Kerri-
gan, Bob Craig, Ned Craig, Dick Bumett, Bob Burnett, Billy Wallis,
Tommy Wallis, Billy Collins, Tom Ross, Jim Fitzgerald, and Charlie
Baker.
Races, Etc., 1859.
July 14 had Warwick all excitement. It was their Winter
meeting, and visitors flock into the town from many outside sta-
tions. Fred Hudson’s Queen’s Hotel had among others, Jock Mc-
Lean, N, Bartley, Beevor, Bob Collins, Garden and Lethbridge. On
the racecourse were the Hardies, Mr. and Mrs. Jepson, Westley, C.
M. Y/innett, Gillespie, Mrs. Simon Mayer, Andrew and Mrs. Ross,
the Cobhams and Gores.
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


The Canning Downs horses easily beat the New England
stables, and in honour of this, also the carnival, Canning Downs
gave the ball of the season, and among the guests were Mrs. Car-
den Collins, Mrs. Beevor Daveney, Mrs. Marshall, the Misses Gore,
Miss Anna West, Mrs. Cooper, Mrs. Jephson, Mrs. Hardie, Mr. N.
Bartley, C. Wheeler and A. F. Matvieff.
The hospitality of this fine old station simply excelled itself,
and the supper was a revelation to city visitors. As there were no
cabs, motors, or other conveniences at that time, the male guests
who had no horses had to walk back to Warwick in the usual winter
morning fog.
The Varsoviana” was then the creme de la creme of all
dances, and Mrs. Simon Mayer with C. M. Winnett opened the eyes
of the guests with this masterpiece. The first piano installed at
Canning Downs had only recently arrived per bullock team, and
furnished the music for this ball.
Water Supply.
The first settlers had to dip their drinking water from the
Condamine by buckets. Then, after the two Hotels commenced busi-
ness, and installed their empty spirit casks for storing drinking
water for their own premises, the public, who could afford it, pur-
chased any empty casks that became available. By degrees, water
carriers came on the scene, and carted water at 1/ per cask. At
that stage of the town’s existence, spouting was not used on any
buildings, most of the shingles being hardwood, which discoloured
the water. Increasing settlement created a good demand for casks
to hold water, and that was met by a cooper named Burfen, who
made splendid casks out of silky oak. The business, therefore, of
water joey became an established one, likewise the cooperage shop.
With the arrival of the Railway on January 31, 1871, galvanised
• ron and spouting became available. Then galvanised tanks took
the place of water casks, many older buildings being installed with
the former, also spouting. Now it was found cheaper to provide
rain water, so the water joeys disappeared, as also did the cooper.
The present Reservoir, after extraordinary efforts, was established!
and that still provides the largest quantity of aqua pura for the
town. the increase of settlement an additional source of
supply was obtained by sinking wells at the mouth of Rosenthal
Creek, and the water from same is pumped up to the higher levels
on the Western side of the town. With these united supplies, the
towr manages to struggle along, but every drought emphasises the
necessity of making a more definite effort if the future of the town

Is to be benefited. The increase of population will force the com-
munity, through their representatives, to seek a more reliable sup-
ply, and this will be obtained by making use of that stored by
nature among the mountains at the heads of our principal water
courses. This will do away with much expensive machinery, by
conveying the water to Warwick by gravitation.
The Maclntyre River.
It will be seen by the preceding pages that this river is fre-
quently mentioned, owing to the fact that it, together with its
tributaries, were on the main pathway of the pioneers travelling to
and from the Darling Downs. It also became the first closely set-
tled portion of the early white men, and the incident I am now re-
cording refers to the Mclntyre Brook, the beautiful tributary of
the above river. When Sir Thomas Mitchell, the New South Wales
Surveyor General of 1840 was surveying the country dividing the
Condamine and Mclntyre River waters, he followed down the North
Branch to the point about a mile above the present town of Ingle-
wood. Here an altercation took place between two of his men, re-
sulting in one named Maclntyre being killed. Sir Thomas, who
had the power to act in any capacity in connection with his men,
at once placed the culprit on his trial, and he was found guilty of
murder, after which he was immediately hung on the spot where
the murder had been committed. From this time forward the North
Branch became the Mclntyre Brook, and the main waterway the
Mclntyre River. Sir Thomas Mitchell died in 1855, and was in-
terred at Sydney.
Queensland’s First Solar Eclipse.
The Solar Eclipse, which occurred on the 21st September, 1922,
is now a thing of the past, and was viewed by the ordinary members
of the public in comfort, while Scientists had all of the up-to-date
instruments and equipment which science had made available. For
>ears tha’ event had been announced by Astronomers, and Queens-
land was selected by those who had made astronomy a life long
study, as one of the finest localities to witness it. Eminent Scien-
tists were able to come by train in the comfort that helps to make
travelling a pleasure, not to mention such conveniences as motor
cars, and sleeping cars, to the towns of Warwick, Stanthorpe, and
Goondiwindi. In 1858 we find that Stanthorpe, as a town, was not
thought of, while the Warwick and Goondiwindi districts only con-
tained a few hundred people, because the sum total of Warwick’s
poll for that towm’s first election for Queensland’s State Parliament
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


was 129 votes, the successful candidate securing 71 out of that total,
that was in 1860, In 1858 the inhabitants of the places men-
tioned had a similar opportunity of seeing a solar eclipse, but to
them, it came as a thief unannounced, because there was only one
paper on the Darling Downs at that time, the “Darling Downs
Gazette,” and it had opened its door in June, 1858. The papers
which found their way to the Downs, came from the towns of Bris-
bane and Ipswich, also from other centres further South in New
South Wales, and if the Editors knew anything about that Eclipse,
did not announce its Importance as the press of the present day
did the recent masterpiece of nature. In comparing notes of early
settlement days, it was the good fortune of the writer, as a youth
of 14, to witness the total eclipse of 1858 in the then wild moun-
tainous country of Killarney, at a spot near the Falls, in Spring
Creek. I had been Instructed to ride up that creek, and see if there
were any suitable iron bark trees, which could be used in the con-
struction of the first bridge, which was to be built over the Conda-
mine River, close to what is now the town of Killarney. While
doing this, I was greatly surprised to find how dismal the morning
was becoming, and thinking that it was the shadows of the high
mountain, took the first opportunity of having a look at the sun,
when I saw that it was partly covered by an eclipse, and decided to
do my best and see what happened as far as the naked eye would
permit. It was about 11 a.m., and the birds were flying to their
roosts from all directions, while the Kookaburras were giving their
farewells. To make the surroundings as weird as possible, the
Curlews began to serenade me with their dismal wails, and life
weemed completely changed. While resting here, I never knew,
that in the thick vine scrub close by, one of those mysterious “Bora”
Ceremonies had only been recently carried out, by the tribe of
aboriginies I knew so well, the “Yocum.” In e.veryday life, I was
under the protection of this tribe for having saved one of their
children from drowning in the Condamine River close by. This,
however, would not have protected me had I ventured into that
scrub when the tests were being carried out. As soon as the
eclipse had passed, I went into the scrub, and while examining the
iron bark trees, came on the recently used bora rings, together with
the stakes against which the “Kippas” had to stand their ground.
I was thus able to make a hurried examination of those stakes
which were adorned by soft stringy bark. For some years after-
wards, this “Bora” ground could be seen, until settlement effaced
It, and like those who used it, are, I regret to say, things of the
past.
THE EARLY HISTORY OF WARWICK DISTRICT.


The Darky Flat Massacre.
In the remarks about the early settlement of Canning Downs,
the Macintyre tribe of aborigines is referred to as 1 being very dan-
gerous, because they frequently attacked the white people. At first
eight it may not be apparent why they were treacherous. There
was, however, a very good reason for their enmity, the cause being,
principally, the white people’s ignorance of their laws and customs,
particularly that part which referred to the Bora Ceremonies. In
the middle forties labour was very scarce, and what little there
was, caused every white person, irrespective of class, to form a bond
of close comradeship for mutual protection against the savages.
Owing to the sparsely settled new country, and the ignorance of
some of the white people as regards locality because there were no
roads —merely bridle tracks —they frequently lost themselves. There-
fore, if there was a semi-civilised black boy in, the district, he was
immediately made use of to track the lost ones. In this way, two
young aspiring squatters from Southern New South Wales, in 1845,
brought with them, two aboroginal youths about 18 years of age,
their names being Jimmy and Toby. These were left in the War-
wick district after the young squatters had finished with them.
Neither of the youths had passed through the “Bora,” and conse-
quently were not under the aboriginal Masonic obligations. This
fatal oversight on the part of the white people, led to one of the
most cruel and unjust massacres of aborigines ever perpetrated on
the Darling Downs, and known as the “Darkey Flat” Massacre. The
aboriginal youths referred to were stationed at Rosenthal and Old
Talgal, respectively, and had been protected by the whites for seve-
ral years. Apart from this, they were taught the use of pistols,
and allowed to carry them when acting as mail men, or working on
the runs. Naturally they soon became cunning through associat-
ing with the white employees and used the knowledge gained by com-
mitting outrages on the young females of the Macintyre tribe, when-
ever an opportunity occurred. The favourite time chosen
was when the fighting members were away hunt-
ing and the girls were fishing. The few old men who tried
to protect their young charges, were promptly threatened
with death at the pistol point. However, they told the young out-
laws, in broken English, that they would be killed first opportunity,
for breaking the tribal laws. These two youths were constantly in
each others company, and frequently camped together. A favourite
meeting place was near what is now, Pratten, which place was always
a camping spot for the M‘lntyre tribe, when they visited the district,
owing to the quantity of game and fish available in the locality. The
two lads had heard from the white people how “King Darby” had
warned the Leslies, of Canning Downs, that three of their shepherds
were to be killed at a certain time, by another tribe, whereupon the


Leshes were able to thwart the attack, thereby saving their men and
killing many of the attackers. For this Darby was rewarded with
rations during his lifetime. Knowing that the other blacks were
a raid of them, because they each carried two double-barrelled pistols
immy and Tommy imagined they could carry on their dastardly
actions under the protection of their white friends. Waiting their
opportunity, the Macintyre tribe who were camped at Pratten, laid
a trap for these young ruffians, shifted the majority of their women
and children, also old men, further back, before daylight, and placed
a few young gins, in charge of old women, at one of the best fishing
holes, while a select number of fighting men hid themselves among
the reeds close by. During the afternoon, Jimmy and Tommy came
riding along, and seeing the girls unprotected, thought matters were in
their favour, so at once moved cautiously towards the gins. Whatever
happened, they realised their danger, turned and fled, although attacked
closely, and narrowly escaped with their lives. They raced to Old
Talgai station, and following Darby’s tactics, reported that they had
been warned by an old gin, that the Mackintyre tribe was going to
kill the white shepherds in the morning, and how narrowly they had
just got away. The white people immediately armed themselves, and
under cover of the darkness, took up a handy position, and at daylight,
attacked the few male members of the tribe already mentioned, killed
everyone. This was made easy, because these friendly blacks never
suspected treachery from their white friends. Never forgetting this,
the remaining members watched for Jimmy and Toby continually, and
at last an opportunity came. They then made a hedgehog of Jimmy’s
body with spears, and threw it on a large ant bed. Toby at once fled
from the Downs and never returned. Being on very friendly terms
with “King Darby” of the Canning Downs'tribe, he told me the fore-
going facts, also that his wife was a member of the Macintyre tribe,
and had lost three biothers in that massacre. Naturally, this woman
was always scheming to have revenge on the white people, and en-
couraged her tribe in that direction against Darby’s wishes, making
it hard for Darby to protect the Leslies and their employees. On one
occasion she was so persistent, that he had to thrash her with a Nulla
Nulla, breaking her arm as a result. As a boy I knew Jimmy, who was
a morose, bad tempered semi-savage, with a thin veneer of civilisation.
The white people never had a friendly feeling for him, and his death
caused no regrets,
"Let fate do her worst, there are moments of joy,
Bright dreams of the past, which she cannot destroy,
Which come in the night time of sorrow and care,
And bring back the features that joy used to wear,
Long, long, be the heart with such memories filled ,
Like a vase in which roses have once been distilled,
You may break, you may shatter, the vase if you will,
But the scent of the roses will cling to it still.”
