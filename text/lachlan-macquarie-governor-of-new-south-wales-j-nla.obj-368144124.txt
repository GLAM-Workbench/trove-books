LACHLAN MACQUARIE
JOURNALS OF HIS TOURS IN NEW SOUTH
WALES AND VAN DIEMEN’S LAND
Lachlan Macquarie has been called the greatest of the early gover-
nors of New South Wales. He was in office from January Ist, 1810, to
December Ist, 1821, and finally left for England in February 1822. In
that time the Colony was reorganised, public buildings were erected,
new roads were made, the first bank was established and exploration
greatly extended the bounds of settlement.
Macquarie considered it to be an important part of his duties to
make personal visits to outlying districts. In his first official Despatch
he wrote that he thought tours of the country to be “essentially necessary
for the improvement of the country in general, and the encouragement
of the Settlers in their Agricultural pursuits in particular”. The journals
kept during his tours are a vivid record of exploration, of visits to
settlers and of the founding of towns.
These journals with other private papers of Macquarie are pre-
served in the Mitchell Library, which is vested in the Trustees of the
Public Library of New South Wales, and the Trustees have chosen the
Journals as a first publication from the wealth of original records in
the Mitchell Library and in the recently bequeathed Library of Sir
William Dixson.
The Journals are being published in full for the first time, the
text following the original as closely as possible. Notes and an index
add to the value of the edition as a work of reference, which will also
contain a facsimile of a page of one of the manuscripts, eleven plates in
colour from contemporary portraits and views, and three folding maps.
His Excellency, General Sir John Northcott, Macquarie’s latest
successor in the office of Governor of New South Wales and at present
Administrator of the Commonwealth of Australia, and His Excellency
Sir Kenneth Street, Lieutenant-Governor, have expressed their willing-
ness to head a list of pre-publication subscribers.
The edition will be one of 1,800 copies, of which 1,775 will be for
sale. Up to 1,775 subscribers in advance will be sure of a copy. Sub-
scribers may apply for more than one copy and additional copies will
be available after all pre-publication subscribers have been allocated one
copy. Any subscriptions which cannot be accepted will be refunded.
The pre-publication price to subscribers is £4.0.0 a copy. Upon
publication the price will be £4.10.0. The usual discount of 15% on
Australian publications will be allowed to libraries. A form of appli-
cation is attached. This must be returned with a remittance for the
number of copies desired not later than September 30th, so that copies
may be distributed in time for Christmas.
