INTRODUCTION
In the course of an inquiry made by the Wartime Social Survey for the
Ministry of Information into what sections of the civilian public could be
reached by various publicity media, some questions were asked about cinema going
habits. The cinema is an important publicity medium in war time and it is,
therefore, desirable to know what sort of people go to the cinema and how often
they go.
A sample of people was interviewed. Men and women were selected in
representative proportions from different regions and occupation groups, and
they were asked simply how often they went to the cinema. Women who had child-
fen of elementary school age were asked how often their children went to the
cinema. Details of the sample are given on page 23.
This inquiry should be regarded as only a first attempt to study cineflia
going habits. The data are subject to various limitations and these should be
borne in mind in the interpretation of results.
(1) Only civilians were included in the sample and it is not known what propor-
tion of cinema audiences are civilians and what proportion H.M, Forces.
(2) The inquiry was made in June - July 194-3 a nd informants were asked only about
their habits at that time. The actual question asked was: "How often do
you go to the cinema at this time of year?" In general, cinemas have
smaller audiences in the summer than in the winter, and also there are
variations from one year to another.
The results given in this report, therefore, can be taken as true for the
stunner months of 194-3 only.
(3) People were asked about their habits in a general way, and in most cases
their replies can be regarded only as approximations to the truth. Those
who went to the cinema regularly one dqy in every week could give an
accurate answer, but those who did not go at regular intervals had to say
about how often they went on an average.
The average number of visits to the cinema per month, given in Section IV
are, therefore, approximations, as are the figures (given in the same
section) showing the proportion of cinema attendances accounted for by
different people.
Possibly more*precise results could have been obtained by asking people how
many times they had been to the cinema in a recent specified period, but
here again some approximation would be necessary on account of the unrelia-
bility of memory.
However, it is possible to compare the habits of different groups of the
population with one another.
In Section I the proportions of the sample and of different groups giving
various replies are shown. Section II deals with those who went to the cinema
once a week or more often. These may be described as "cinema enthusiasts" and
their composition is compared with the composition of the adult civilian
population. Both of these sections are concerned only with adults.
In Section 111 the habits of children of elementary school age are shown,
as described by their mothers.
Section IV sums up the results given in the previous sections and shows the
composition of the civilian part of the average cinema audiences during the
summer of 194-3.
Summary of results
lOfo of adult civilians sometimes go to the cinema and 32% go once a week or .
more often (June - July 1943) • Younger adults go to the cinema much more than
older people, and children go rather more than do adults, but not as much as
young wage-earners.

DC W532/1


The lov/er economic groups and those with elementary education go to the
cinema more than the higher economic groups and those with higher education.
Factory workers, clerical and distributive workers go rather more than other
occupation groups. Managerial and professional workers, housewives and the
retired’ and unoccupied go rather less.
Town .dwellers go to the cinema more often than people living in the country,
and women go rather more than men.
The cinema is able to reach large sections of the population which are less
accessible by other publicity media. For instance, many of the groups with a
high average cinema attendance, the younger age groups and the lower economic
groups read newspapers less than do others, (See Wartime Social Survey report
"Newspapers and the Public"), On the other hand some smaller groups-, the
higher economic groups and those with higher education, read newspapers more but
go to the cinema less.
In general it may be said that the lai'ge groups of the population are
relatively better represented in the cinema audience than they are in the publics
reached by other visual publicity media such as newspapers and books.

I. FREQUENCY OF CINEMA GOING
Informants were asked, "How often do you go to the cinema at this time of
year?" (June - July). An exact reply to the question was not, of course,
possible in all cases but those who did not go regularly were able to say
whether they went about once a fortnight or once a month, or whether they only
went occasionally. Those who went to the cinema less them once a month were
classified as occasional cinema-goers. The question was confined to "this
time of year" and the summer months, as habits vary somewhat according to the
season. The summer months may be taken as the least popular period for the
cinema, attendances being in general higher in the winter. There are, of
course, variations from one year to another, and it should be noted that the
results given in this report refer to the summer of 1943.
The percentages of the sample giving different replies are shown in Table 1.
The cinema is thus an important form of recreation for one-third of the
adult civilian population, who go once a week or more often,
A further 12J5 go to the cinema about once a month or once a fortnight, and
26f a go less frequently,
■3Q& do not go to the cinema during the summer months.
There are marked differences shown below in the habits of sane groups in
the population. Certain sections are, therefore, more open to the influence of
cinema publicity than are others.
Analysis by Sex
There are, however, only small differences in the habits of men and women
in this respect, as is shown by Table 2.

Most remarkable is the very high proportion of children aged 14-17 who go
to the cinema once a week and more often, U5% of this group go to the cinema
twice a week or more often and as many as one fifth go more than twice a week.
It should be pointed out that children of this age who are still at school are
excluded from the sample which is designed to represent the adult civilian popu-
lation, an "adult" being defined in this survey as a person who has left school.
Thus this group consists of young workers, and it is clear,from these results
this group more than any other is open to the influence of cinema publicity.
in sample figures here and elsewhere are due to some forms being
unclassified in some respects. In Table 3 the sum of the sample figures for
different age groups is less than the total sample figure because some forms
were unclassified in respect of age.

The 18-40 group also show a higher than average proportion attending
cinemas a week or more often. This is a broad age group and it may be assumed
from the general trend of the results that the younger members of this group go
to cinemas considerably more than the older members.
Of those aged over 65 a high proportion, •do not go to cinemas, and in
the middle age groups the proportions going-to the cinema only occasionally are
higher.
The results of this analysis show that as a channel of publicity the cinema
is likely to afford contact much more with younger than with older people.
The table below shows the proportions of men and women in different age
groups who went to the cinema once a week and more, less than once a week, and
not at all.
About the same proportion of men as of women in the different age groups do
not go to the cinema. Amongst those aged over 65 there are no statistically
significant differences in the proportions of men and of women giving various
replies. In the younger and middle age groups however, the proportion of women
going to the cinema once a week or more is rather higher than the proportion of
men, the latter more frequently going less than once a week.
Analysis by Marital Status
There is little difference in the habits of married and single people when
age is taken into consideration. Comparison of married and widowed people with
single people in the 18-45 age group shows a higher proportion of the single
group visiting cinemas frequently, but it must be remembered that the average age
of the single people in this group is likely to be very much lower than that of
the married people, and if the habits of married and widowed people are compared
with the habits of single people in the 46 - 65 age group no statistically
significant differences are shown.
Table 5 shows the proportion of married and widowed people and of single
people giving different answers in these two age groups and the proportions of
all married and widowed people and all single people aged 18 or over giving
different answers.

In .the 18-45 group there is only a small difference between the propor-
tions of married and of single people who do not go to the cinema. However, a
considerably higher proportion of single people go once a week or more often.
It is clear from these figures that cinema publicity is likely to affect a
greater proportion of the unmarried than of the married, chiefly because more of
the former are in the younger age groups who go to cinemas more frequently.
Analysis by Economic Groups
Informants were classified in different economic groups according to the wage
rate or salary of the chief wage-earner of their families. The lower group
includes member of families in which the chief wage earner has a wage rate of £5
or less per week, and also of families whose income is derived from state
pensions or allowances. If the chief wage earner had a wage rate or salary of
over £5 up to £lO informants were classified in the middle group, and if the
salary or income was over £lO, in the higher group. The lower group includes
of the population, the middle group 20? o and the higher group 5/»*
It is quite clear that in the lower economic group the proportion of frequent
cinema goers is higher, and the middle group show a greater proportion than the
higher group.
However, in the middle and higher groups the proportion of those who go less
frequently is higher, and a smaller proportion of these groups than of the lower
group do not go to the cinema at all.
In considering the very marked difference in the proportions that go to the

cinema more than twice a week it should be remembered that the lower economic
group includes a higher proportion of boys and girls aged from 14 - 17, and
that of this age group as many as 20/o went more than once a week. Boys and
girls of this age in the higher and middle groups are more frequently at school
still and are, therefore, excluded from the sample.
Analysis by Education
There are sharp differences between different education groups. Informants
were classified according to the last place of education attended by them,
elementary, secondary or technical school, university and other types of school.
Figures are not given for the last of these groups as it includes a variety of
different types.
About the same proportion of those with elementary education as of those who
had been to secondary or technical, schools went to the cinema once a week or more.
Of those with university education a greater proportion went less frequently.
The proportion not visiting cinemas is highest in the Elementary group.
Tables 6 and 7 show that substantial proportions, of all economic groups and
of people at all levels of education may be reached by cinema publicity. The
differences observed between different groups in this respect are very much less
than the differences between age groups.
Analysis by Occupation
In the table below replies have been grouped for greater clarity. The
percentages of different occupation groups who go to the cinema once a week and
more, less than once a week, and who do not go, are shown.

Relatively high proportions of workers in light manufacturing and in the
clerical, distributive and miscellaneous groups go to the cinema once a week or
more. Light munitions workers and clerical workers go more than other groups.
Only small proportions in these groups do not go to cinemas.
Agricultural workers and the retired and unoccupied show the lowest
proportions of frequent cinema goers. The latter group is composed largely of
old people. 6 3% in this group and 58$ of agricultural workers do not go to the
cinema.
Of managerial and professional workers a high proportion go less than once a
week. It will be remembered that the higher economic and education groups had a
high proportion occasionally going to the cinema.
Of housewives a rather lower than average proportion go once a week or more
often. Compared with other groups there is a high of older people in
this group, women in the younger age groups more orten being wage-earners.
Amongst factory workers analysis was made of replies received from skilled,
semi-skilled and unskilled workers.
Investigators asked the management or the welfare officer at the factories
visited to grade the workers as skilled, semi-skilled or unskilled, and so the
way in which workers were classified depends on the personal judgment of these
people, and not on any recognised craft or trade union definition. This may
account for the high proportion classified as "skilled". There are however,
some marked differences between the different groups.
34 Sample figures for these two groups are bracketted because the proportion of
munitions workers included in the whole sample is based on secret and confidential
figures.

The differences shown are no doubt related to the age composition of the
different groups. It will be remembered that of young people aged from 12*. - 17
markedly high proportions went to the cinema very frequently, and the majority of
factory workers in this age group would either be just commencing work and there-
fore unskilled, or apprentices graded as semi-skilled. The semi-skilled grpup
shows a very high proportion of workers going to the cinema once a week or more
often, and of the unskilled very high proportions go more than once a week.
Analysis of the age composition of these groups has not been made, but it is
probable that the unskilled group is composed largely of very young workers and
of labourers above military age. The skilled group on the other hand would be
more mixed as regards the proportions in the middle and older groups but would
not be likely to include many very young workers. Skilled workers go to the
cinema rather less frequently than other factory workers. The results for this
group approximate to the results given for distributive workers.
Analysis by Size of Town
Table 10 shavs the proportions of people living in ta/ns of different
sizes and in rural areas who gave different replies. The replies have again
been grouped as the differences may be seen more clearly in this way.
Half the people living in rural areas said they did not go to the cinema at
this time of the year. It will he remembered that agricultural workers went,
less frequently than other occupation groups. Of those people in rural areas
who do go to cinemas a relate v small proportion go as often as once a week.
People living in small to.ms go to the cinema less frequently than those living
in largar and medium sized tarns, but much more frequently that do people in
rural, areas.
These differences in habit are no doubt due in some measure to the distri-
bution of cinemas in different types of district. For people living in rural
areas a visit to the cinema means travelling to a tovvn and there may not always
be sufficient transport services. In a small town there are few cinemas and
the choice of films is therefore limited. Nevertheless, as many as 30$ in small
tavns go once a week or more often.
In considering the regional figures given below, these differences should be
borne in mind, since the proportions of people living in the country and in small
towns vary very much from one region to another.

East Anglia, the South, South West, South East and the North Midlands are
all regions in which the bulk of the population lives in small towns or in the
country.
The North region (Northumberland and Durham) shows a high proportion of
frequent cinema goers and a somewhat low proportion going to cinemas less often.
The results for London, the North Vest and the Midlands approximate to the
results for those living in large and medium sized towns in the country as a
whole. The North East shows a rather low proportion going to the cinema once a
week or more considering the distribution of towns of different sizes and rural
areas in this region.
In Scotland the proportions giving different replies are about average. In
Wales the percentage of frequent cinema goers is somewhat low but it should be
noted the sample is small.
On the whole it may be said that differences between regions are small when
the distribution of the population in different types of district is taken-into
consideration. The only outstanding difference is that noted in the Northern
region, and this is not particularly large.

II WHO ARE THE CINEMA ENTHUSIASTS
The last section dealt with the frequency with which different sections of
the adult civilian population visited cinemas. Members of the Forces were
excluded from the inquiry and the habits of children will be dealt with later.
Those who went to the cinema once a week or more often may be regarded as
cinema enthusiasts, and these sire more open to the influence of cinema publicity
than are other civilians, it is worth while, therefore, to analyse the composi-
tion of this group to compare it with the oompositionof the adult civilian
population.
In the present section those who went to the cinema once a week or more are
regarded as a group, and the proportions of this group having different charac-
teristics, e.g, age, sex, occupation, are shown and compared with corresponding
proportions of the whole sample.
Women are rather better represented in the enthusiastic group than are men,
but the difference is not a very large one.
It is clear that the younger age groups,are more fully represented amongst
the enthusiasts than are the older. Of the enthusiastic group, 70/ were aged
under 41, hut of the sample 47/ are in this age group. It is thus mainly the
younger groups that can be influenced by cinema publicity, and it would not be
very profitable to publicise messages particularly intended for the older groups
in this way.
Analysis by sex by age shows that both young men and young women are better
represented amongst the enthusiasts than older men and women.

It will be remembered that single people Trent to the cinema rather more
frequently than married people and that this was related to the age composition
of the married and single groups. More than half the enthusiastic group are
married, but married people form about three-quarters of the population.
Analysis by Economic Group
Amongst enthusiasts the lower economic groups are somewhat better represented
than the higher. However, the difference is not very great and it should be
remembered that in the middle and higher economic groups a greater proportion go
to the cinema once a fortnight or less and a smaller proportion never go to the
cinema than in the lower economic group.
Analysis by Occupation
In the table below the different occupations are grouped. The factory group
includes workers in heavy and light industry, both munitions workers and others.
"Other Manual Work" includes agriculture, mining, building and transport and
miscellaneous workers.
Factory workers and the clerical and distributive group account for 54$ of
the enthusiasts but only for 41$ of the sample.
Housewives and the retired and unoccupied form only 26$ of the enthusiasts
but 57$ of the whole sample. These groups axe, therefore, somewhat under
represented.. Managerial and professional workers are somewhat under
represented.

People living in large and medium sized towns are rather better represented
amongst enthusiasts than people living in small towns, and those living in the
country are under represented.
It was pointed out in the previous section that regional differences were
related to the proportion of people living in towns of different sizes and in
rural areas, which vary considerably from one region to another.
Analysis by Region
In general those regions where large sections of the population live in the
country and in small towns are somewhat under represented.
The North West, London, the North and the Midlands together account for
54$ of the enthusiasts, but only for 44$ of the population.
Summing up this short section, it may be said that those enthusiasts who go
to the cinema once a week or more, are drawn, from all sections of the adult
civilian population; but that certain sections are somewhat better represented
among them than are others.
A relatively high proportion of enthusiasts are*young people. In fact 70$
of the enthusiasts are younger than 41. Women are represented in the group
somewhat better than men. About a third of the enthusiasts are factory workers
and about a fifth work in offices aid shops.
The vast majority of them (925) are towns-people. In the country the cinema
is less important. They are scattered over all urban areas of Great Britain with
no important regional differences.
It should be stressed that this section and the previous section deal only
with the adult civilian population.

III. CHILDREN AND THE CINEMA.
Amongst the married women interviewed in this sample were 759 mothers of
children aged from five to fourteen. These were asked about the habits of their
children. . The question was "How often do the children (aged 5 - 14) go to the
cinema at this time of year?".
The 759 mothers had between them 1182 children in the age group concerned,
and where possible information was obtained about each child. No information was.
obtained about 169 (145 a) of the children and the results are based, therefore, on
replies about 1013 children only.
In the table below the proportions of children going to.the cinema at
different intervals of time are compared with the corresponding proportions of
the whole sample of adults (see Table 1) and of the young people aged 14-17
included in the sample of adults (Table 3)-
A considerably higher proportion of children than of adults go to the cinema
once a week or more often. However, the young people aged from 14 - 17 show a
very much higher proportion going very frequently.
These results suggest that the cinema is an extremely popular recreation with
the young, and although children go frequently when at school, as soon as they
are earning money themselves, they go even more often.
Analysis by Economic Group
There are differences in the habits of children in different economic groups.
In Table 20 results for the middle and higher economic groups are given together
as the sample of children in the higher group is small.

Children in the lower group go to the cinema more frequently. A substantial
proportion in this group go once a week or more often.
In both the lower and the middle and higher incane groups the children go to
the cinema rather more frequently than do their elders.
The difference between the results for adults and children is not so marked
in the middle and higher economic groups and it should be noted that the sample of
children in these groups is small. However, the difference is statistically
significant. 6.38.- n= 2. Pis less them .05 and there is thus
evidence that the habits of children and adults in the higher and middle economic
groups do differ. In the case of the lower economic group, the difference is
quite clear.
Analysis by Mother’s Education
There are some differences in cinema going between the children of women who
went only to an elementary school and those who had. further education.
The children of women with higher education went to the cinema less
frequently. Half the children of women with elementary education only went
once a week or more often.
There are no statistically significant differences between the results for
children whose mothers had secondary education and for adults in this education
group. Children of mothers with elementary education went to the cinema more
frequently than adults with elementary education.
Sample pigures do not check with the total because no analysis is made of
replies for/6? children whose mothers went to other and various types of school.
None of the'mothers went to universities.

902
Analysis by Mother 1 s Occupation
The mothers of 111 of the children went out to work and the mothers of the
remaining 902 children were housewives only. Table 23 shows the results for
these two groups of children.
The sample of children with mothers at work is small, but the differences
shown are nevertheless significant. The proportion of children with working
mothers who go to the cinema once a week or more often is considerably higher
than the proportion of other children who do so. It is, of course, possible
that the children of mothers who go out to work have an older average age, and
this might account for the difference.
The numbers of children in the sample in different regions are not sufficient
to permit a regional analysis of these results.
Summing up the results given in this section;
(1) Children go to the cinema rather more than adults but less than young
people aged 14 - 17.
(2) Children in families in the lower economic groups go rather more than
children from families in the higher economic groups, and those whose
mothers have only elementary education rather more than those whose
mothers have higher education.
(3) The children of women who go out to work go to the cinema more than
do other children.


IV. THE CINEMA AUDIENCE
From the results given in Sections I and, 111,, it is possible to build up a
rough picture of the civilian cinema audience. These two sections showed how
often different groups of adults and children visited cinemas, and from the
figures given an approximate idea of the average number of cinema attendances per
month for each group may be derived.
It will be remembered that some informants were classified as going to the
cinema "occasionally" and others as going "more than twice a week". It is not,
therefore, possible to work out a precise average but some indication may be
obtained.
A further limitation of the data is that there is no information about the
habits of children aged over 14 who are still at school. These were not
included in the sample of adults, and mothers were asked only about their
children aged from 5 - 14. School children aged over 14 however, form only a
small section, between I£o and Z/o of the civilian population aged 5 and over.
Their exclusion is, therefore, not of great importance.
The average number of cinema attendances per month was calculated as
follows:
Frequency of Cinema Estimated number of
attendance attendances per month
Don't go to cinema 0
Occasionally 0.5
Once a month 1
Once a fortnight 2
Once a week 4
Twice a week 8
More than twice a week 10
The averages given below must be regarded as only approximations to the
actual averages, but they make it possible to compare the habits of different
groups by means of a single measure.
It will be ■ remembered that information was obtained from mothers of about
1013 children. Where results are given for adults and children together the
results for children have been weighted so that they are correctly represented
in the whole sample of adults and children.

By calculating the total number of visits made to the cinema per month by
each group, the composition of the civilian section of cinema audiences may be
shown.
In the diagrams below, the percentages of cinema attendances accounted for
by different groups of the population are compared with the distribution of
the population amongst these groups.
. The diagrams on the right may be taken as representing "the average
civilian cinema audience" in the summer months of 1943*
Table 25
Children sire well represented in the cinema audience and men somewhat
under represented.
Children from 5 “ 17 account for nearly a third of oinema attendances but
only for about a fifth of the population. Those aged over 45 account for a
third of the population but only for 15j£ of cinema attendances. The 18-40
age group is well represented in the cinema audience.


% Civilian Population fo Civilian Cinema Attendances

The lower economic group is better represented in the cinema audience than

People from rural areas are under represented in the cinema audience, but
people from all sizes of town are well represented.

Factory workers and clerical and distributive workers account for 457° of

Comparisons with Other Publicity Media
It is of interest to compare the public reached by the cinema with the
public reached by other kinds of publicity media. In Wartime Social Survey
reports K "Newspapers and the Public" and "M. 0.1. Publications" information is
given about the extent to which different groups in the population read daily
newspapers and other types of publication.
Where results show a trend, as for instance in analyses by age or economic
groups, the direction of the trends shown for different types of publicity may
be compared.

In Table 26 the average cinema attendances per month for different groups are
compared with:
(a) The percentage who saw a morning newspaper "yesterday"
(b) The percentage saying they buy "weekly or monthly magazines or papers
about matters of public interest"
(c) The percentage saying they buy "small books (of the Penguin or Pelican
type) about matters of public interest"
The figures in brackets show the rating.
Sex
Newspapers and books show a contrary result to cinemas, the figures for men
being higher than those for women. About the same proportion of both sexes buy
magazines.
Age
Younger people go to the cinema much more often than old people. With
newspapers and books the figure for the middle age groups is highest, the young
and the old seeing these less. In the case of magazines, as with cinemas, the
figures for older people are lower, but the middle age groups buy magazines, as
much or rather more than the youngest group.
Economic Group and Education Group
The cinema figures are highest in the lower groups but a trend in the
opposite direction is shown in the case of the other three publicity media.
From these comparisons it is clear that the cinema can be a valuable
publicity medium in that cinema publicity is likely to reach particularly some
of those groups in the population which are less open to the influence of other
media, women, the younger age groups, the lower economic groups and those with
elementary education.
Hie lower economic and education groups are numerically more important them
the higher, and it may be said that cinemas reach a wider public than other
media.

THE SAMPLE
The sample was designed to represent the adult civilian population, which
was defined as all civilians aged fourteen or over with the exception of those
still at school.
Representative quotas of men and women in different occupation groups were
set for each of the twelve Civil Defence Regions, the number interviewed in each
region being proportionate to its population.
A total of 5639 people were interviewed. These were distributed as shown
below.
The age distribution of men is, of course, affected by the fact that large
numbers in the middle age groups are in the -Forces and are, therefore, excluded
from the sample.
