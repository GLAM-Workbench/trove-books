Meteoeological observations to be of scientific value must be made on a
uniform, plan, and taken with standardised instruments, otherwise the
results will not be mutually comparable.
Classification of Stations.
Second Order Stations are equipped with self-recording instruments,
also with a barometer, a maximum thermometer, a minimum thermo-
meter, a dry-bulb thermometer, a wet-bulb thermometer, and with appara-
tus for determining solar and terrestrial radiation, a screen, a rain-
gauge, an evaporator, and a wind-vane or self-recording anemometer.
Third Order Stations have a barometer, a maximum thermometer, a
minimum thermometer, a dry-bulb, thermometer, a wet-bulb thermometer,
a screen, a rain-gauge, and also, where necessary, a wind-vane.
Climatological Stations are equipped with a maximum thermometer, a
minimum thermometer, a dry-bulb thermometer, a wet-bulb thermometer,
a rain-gauge, and, where necessary, a wind-vane.
Rain Stations are equipped with a rain-gauge and, where necessary,
with a wind-vane.
Hours of Observations.
Observations for forecasting purposes are to be taken—
(а) In tbe Eastern States, at 9 a.m.—standard time (150° meridian);
(б) In South Australia and the Northern Territory, at 8.30 a.m.—
standard time (142£° meridian);
(c) In Western Australia, at 8 a.m,—standard time (120° meridian);
and wired immediately, in code (vide pages 16-19), in the following order,
to the Divisional Office: —Barometer (corrected), dry bulb, wet bulb, and
maximum and minimum thermometers, direction and force of wind, rain-
fall (in points), cloud (amount, type, and direction). Weather remarks
(see page 15). Coastal Stations should also furnish the state of the sea,
and River Stations the height of the river.
Observations for purely climatological purposes are to be taken at local
time. In the case of Rain Stations and Climatological Stations, at
9 a.m. only; at Second and Third Order Stations, at 9 a.m,, 3 p.m., and
9 p.m. For difference between standard and local time, vide chart.
Instructions to Country Observers.


Keeping of Registers.
To conform with the meteorological regulations of the chief kindred
institutions of the world, subject, however, to such adaptations as are
necessary to meet our peculiar conditions and special requirements, and
for the satisfactory reduction of observations, it is necessary that the
monthly observing books be sent by post with the monthly returns, or as
soon after as may be convenient. *But before doing so, the observations
should be entered in the register books supplied for* local reference. ;
Method of Reading Instruments —The Barometer.
First note the reading of the attached thermometer to the nearest tenth
of a degree—if the barometer is a Fortin, adjust the mercury in the
cistern by turning the screw at the bottom of the cistern, so that the ivory
point is just brought into contact with the surface of the mercury, but
does not depress it; the ivory point and its reflected image in the mercury
should appear to just touch each other and form a double cone. Then
gently tap the tube with the finger, to prevent the mercury from adhering
to-the glass. Next turn the vernier (the .small adjustable scale), so that
its two lower edges just touch the rounded top of the mercury, i.e., the
front and back edges of the vernier, the top of the mercury, and the eye
of the observer must be in- the same straight line (fig. I). Move the
head up and down to make sure that this is so; then read off the division
next below the lower edge (A, fig. I) of the vernier. Suppose it to be
between 29*050 inches and 29*100 inches, the reading is 29*050 inches
plus the vernier indication. Next look along the vernier until one of its
lines is found to be continuous with a line on the scale. Suppose this is
at the fourth division on the vernier—as each of the figures marked on
the vernier counts as a hundredth, and each intermediate division as two
thousandths—the reading on the vernier will be *OOB inch (vide C,
fig. I). The .reading of the barometer is therefore 29*050 + *OOB
= 29*058 inches. Should two lines on the vernier be nearly continuous
with two on the scale, the intermediate value should be adopted. For
example: suppose that any two lines on the vernier, such as *OlO and
‘OOB appear to be both continuous with two on the scale, then the reading
of the vernier would be *OO9. The barometer reading would, conse-
quently, be 29*050 + *OO9 = 29*059 inches.
After the reading has been taken, if the barometer is a Fortin, the
mercury in the cistern should be lowered by turning the screw at the
bottom until the surface is well below the ivory point, otherwise dirt will
collect and the mercury will oxidise immediately underneath the ivory
point, and its reflected image will become indistinct. If the barometer
is of the Kew pattern, no adjustment of the cistern has to be made, and
the vernier is read exactly as with the Fortin.
Note, —The scale on the instrument is usually divided into inches,
tenths, and half-tenths, and the vernier, being made equal in length to
twenty-four divisions of the scale, is divided into twenty-five equal parts.
Each division of the vernier is therefore shorter than each division of the
scale, by the twenty-fifth part of *O5, which is *OO2 inch.
• Observers are advised to keep their register book and monthly return forma entered np to date, eo
as to avoid delay in posting returns at the end of each month.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR READING THE BAROMETER.
1. First read the attached thermometer, to the nearest 31000
■tenth of a degree. 3o«bo
6 050 -»oo
2. Lightly tap the barometer tube with the finger to enable <ms . _ 850
the mercury column to truly adjust itself. 040 _ 800
044 _ ‘750 _
3. Raise the vernier well above the top of the mercury; 04a -too *
then lower it until both front and back lower edges of the 04ft__ — -eso
vernier are in line with the top of the curved mercury surface. 030 _ .goo
A little light will thus be visible on each side of the apparent ose -sso
point of contact.) 034 .500
032 _
4. Note the value, on the fixed barometer scale, of the line , 03flL
next below the position of the bottom edge, or zero line, oza ” 3go
•on the vernier, that is, below the top of the mercury. (The « 3QO
longer lines show tenths of an inch, and the shorter lines half 0 *" OM ' 2g(J •
tenths, so that if we count up from, say, the 29£ inches line
and write out their values to three places of decimals, we get ©2Q
successively 29-500, 29’550, 29-600, 29-650 inches, and so on.) 018
5. Run your eye up the vernier scale until you come to that " -° 5O
line on it which is exactly level with some line on the fixed 30 000
scale of the barometer. 010 ~— 29-950

6. Add the vernier scale value of this line to that of the oos _— , 850
barometer scale line just noted. (The vernier scale value is 006 _ -soo
obtained in -this way. The- kmg lines below the point of . - .750
coincidence give the number of hundredths of an' inch and the A ~ .700
additional short lines up to the point of coincidence the ' 'jifflSC—" 'eso *
thousandths of an inch, reckoned two at a time, to be added ' Wk eoo
to the reading of the barometer scale. For example, suppose ||ji , 550
the line on the vernier which appeared to be level with one of |jl . 500
the barometer scale lines was the third above the second BB| -450
long line marked 2, then there would be two hundredths 1
and six thousandths of an inch to be added to the reading of jffij , 350
the barometer scale already obtained. Suppose this to be |®_ , 300

(For a barometer reading of 29-677 inches, the rise of one-
thousandth of an inch would throw the third line above the ~
figure 2 on the vernier slightly out of coincidence with its
barometer scale line but bring the fourth line nearer, so that
both these lines would be equally near coincidence with lines |s|
on the barometer scale. For a reading of 29-678, the fourth |
line above would coincide ; and so on.) I ~

In the event of these instructions being ineffectual, the observer should
immediately report the matter to the nearest divisional officer, who will,
if necessary, send by first post a new instrument, on receipt of which the
old one must always be returned, no matter what the condition may be.
Thermometer Screen.
The thermometers above referred to must be exposed in a s regulation
screen (see fig. No. IV), in order that true shade temperature results may
be secured. The screen is to be mounted on four stout splayed legs, in a
free and open space, to the south of any buildings, and with the door
facing true south, and at such a height that the bulbs of the dry and wet
thermometers shall be 4 feet above the level of the ground.
Terrestrial Radiation.
Whenever a minimum thermometer is supplied for terrestrial radiation
the instrument should be placed on the wooden rests, with the bulb just
touching the ground, and the other end about half an inch off, in an open
position (not under the screen), and with a fence or some protection
around it, to prevent it from being trod on. It must be read every morn-
ing, exactly the same as the minimum in the screen, and reset in the
afternoon. During the heat of the day it is advisable to place it in the
screen, or protect it in some way from the rays of the sun. The spirit
column is very liable to become detached or broken, and the thermometer
should therefore be frequently examined.
Rain-gauge.
This instrument is used for measuring any form of precipitation, be it
rain, hail, or dew. A gauge of special pattern is supplied for measuring
snow.
The exposure of the rain-gauge is a very important matter. A too-
sheltered position is as objectionable as a too-exposed one.
The wind is the most serious disturbing influence. Driving rain will
fail to reach the opening of the gauge, if it is placed too close to buildings
or trees. On the other hand, if it is in a very open position, the wind
blowing against the gauge causes eddies, which occasionally carry away
considerable quantities of rain; as much as 20 per cent, has been known
to be lost at times.
The site selected, should, if possible, be an open one, unobstructed by
high trees or fences. Low fences, structures, or hedges are, however, an
advantage, if at distance not less than the heights of the surrounding
objects.
The British Rainfall Organisation has framed rules for securing uni-
formity in recording rainfall on which the following are based, and
Australian observers are requested to adhere to them where practicable.
1. Selection of Site. —A rain-gauge should be placed on a level piece
of ground, not upon a slope or terrace, and certainly not on a wall or
roof. It should be at a distance from every object higher than itself,
and should never be nearer to a wall or house than a distance equal to

the height of that object, nor nearer to a growing shrub or tree than a
distance equal to twice that height. Care should be taken to keep flowers
or vegetables away from the gauge for a distance of at least 3 feet all
round. The height above the sea-level should be determined, if possible,
by levelling from the nearest bench mark. The approximate height may
be easily ascertained in many cases by reference to the maps of the official
Survey Department. A specific name should be selected by each observer
for his station.
2. Mountain and Moorland Sites. —Care should be taken that mountain
or moorland gauges are not unduly exposed to the sweep of the wind.
A level patch of ground or a very slight hollow should be selected, and a
turf wall about 2 feet high, surrounding the gauge at a distance of from
6 to 10 feet, is recommended.
3. Placing the Gauge. —The gauge should be planted in the earth and
fixed in a box (fig. Y) by stakes, or placed in a hole which exactly fits it,
in a block of cement. It should be fixed so firmly that it will neither be
blown over nor tilted by the strongest wind, and it is best to be surrounded
by short grass. The gauge should be occasionally examined, and repaired
if any leakage or other defect is detected, and a report made of the
circumstance to the central bureau.
4. Height above Ground. —The funnel of a rain-gauge should be set
exactly level, and at a height of about 1 foot above ground. If the gauge
is surrounded by long grass, or likely to become so, the height may be as
much as 1 ft. 6 in., but it should never be more.
5. Change of Gauge. —When an old established gauge has to be discon-
tinued for any reason, a new gauge should be established on a proper site
one year, or, if possible, two years, before the old one is removed, so that
the readings of both may be compared and the continuity of the record
ensured. This rule does not apply to the substitution for an old gauge,
which has become defective, of a new gauge of the same size and pattern
on the same site. It is most convenient to start a new gauge on Ist
January. The fact of a change, with date, distance, and direction from
former site, should be reported to the central bureau when it is made.
6. Absence of Observer. —An assistant should, if possible, be trained
to measure the rainfall in the absence of the observer. When no such
provision can be made it should be arranged to have the gauge visited
at the usual hour, and the water bottled and labelled, to be kept until
the observer returns.
7. Hour of Observation. —Rainfall should be measured at 9 a.m. daily,
and the amount entered against the date on which it is measured.
. 8. Heading the Rain Glass. —ln measuring rain by means of the gradu-
ated glass the observer must pour the water carefully from the gauge into
the glass measure. The reading should be taken by holding it upright
or setting it on a level slab, then bringing the eye opposite the level of
the water so as to fix the nearest line on the scale to the water surface, not
necessarily the line next above or the line next below the surface, but the
one of these which is nearer. Each division represents one point. If
there is more water in the gauge than can be measured at once, the glass
should be filled up to the 50 mark, emptied into a jar, and filled up again
as often as necessary, counting the number of times, and finally measur-
ing the residue in the usual way. The water in the jar may be measured


again roughly to make sure that no mistake has been made in counting
the number of half-inches. The amount should be written'down before
the water is thrown away; Every measuring glass supplied by the central
bureau is certified.
9. Heavy Bains. —Although a. self-recording gauge affords the fullest
information as to heavy rains in, short periods, an ordinary gauge can
also be utilised. The gauge should be examined immediately on the cessa*
tion of heavy rain,’ the amount and the time of commencement and cessa-
tion noticed, and the water returned to the gauge, so as not to interfere
with next morning’s reading. As a fall of 4 inches or more may occur
in one day in any part of Australia (though few observers believe this
until they experience it), no gauge of less capacity should be used. If
/after heavy rain there appears to be any likelihood of the gauge over-
flowing, it should be measured and emptied, and the amount added to
the next morning’s reading. ,
Evaporators.
Vessels or tanks used for determining the amount of evaporation should
be exposed in as natural a way as possible, and such vessels or tanks
should be fenced around, to prevent dogs or other animals drinking from
them..
Wind Direction.
The wind should be observed to 16 points of the compass, and capital
letters should be entered in the register to indicate the directions, thus:
N North., , S South.,
NNE North-north-east. SSW South-south-west.
NE North-east. SW South-west.
ENE East-north-east. WSW West-south-west.
E-*. East. W.V West.
ESE". East-south-east. WNW.’ West-north-west.
SE South-east. NW North-west.
SSE South-south-east. NNW North-north-west.
The direction of the wind may be ascertained from the indication of.
a.freely-moving vane; when such is not available, by observing the drift
of smoke. By the direction of the wind is meant that point of the com-
pass from which it is blowing. Care must be taken by watching the vane
for a few minutes to see that the direction is that' of the general current
of air passing over the place, and’that the air-current is not affected by
local circumstances.
It is desirable to fix astronomically one cardinal point, and frequently
to examine the position of the pointers of the vane—a pole carrying'a
vane is liable to twist owing to changes of humidity. The true north
point'may be determined by means of the azimuth compass, by applying
the magnetic variation; correction corresponding to the position of the
station'(see Isogonic Chart, fig. VI).
The magnetic variation, is* easterly to the-east, of the 0° line, and
westerly to the west off itf. Thus, at Port Augusta ( vide chart, fig. VI),
and at all places through which the same 5° line passes the true north is
5° to the west of the direction shown by the compass needle, and so on.

Instructions for Erecting Wind Vane
NOTE.—Please Paste in Instruction Book after Page 12.
When erecting a Yane care must betaken —
(1) That it is freely exposed on all sides, and not affected
by local eddies, &c.
(2) That it moves freely.
(3) That the cardinal points indicated on the Yane are
correctly set.
The Yane is packed in eight separate parts. The pedestal with
centre bracket for the arms indicating the cardinal points and also the
bottom flange are packed in one piece.
■ To erect Yane : Fix the pedestal temporarily, and screw the arms
into the centre bracket (Fig. 2) in the positions indicated in Fig. 4,
and then screw on the lock nuts.
In the same manner put together the floater (Fig. 3), care being
taken not to pinch the inner tube by screwing the arms too far (as the
sensitiveness of the Yane would be greatly diminished), and lock by
the lock nuts provided (Fig. 3).
The arrow head is fixed flat, and the observer will find it is much
easier to read, especially at night, than if the head were vertical
(Fig. I)-
It may be better, if fixing the Yane on a post, to remove bottom
flange and bore a hole in the post about 12in. deep, and wedge the
pedestal firmly and vertically into this.
It is desirable to fix astronomically one cardinal point, and
frequently to examine the position of the pointers of the Yane. A pole
carrying a Yane is liable to twist owing to changes of humidity. The
true north point may be determined by means of the magnetic compass
by applying the magnetic variation correction corresponding to the
position of the station (see Isogonic Chart following p. 12 in
Instruction Book).
The magnetic variation is easterly to the east of the 0° line, and
westerly to the west of it. Thus, at Melbourne (see Chart), and at all
places through which the same line, about 8° 15', passes, the true
north is 8° 15' to the west of the direction shown by the compass
needle, and so on.
Care should be taken when using a compass that it is not subjected
to any disturbing effects which may be introduced by the presence of
iron or steel bodies, or of powerful electric currents. When using a
compass, the observer should satisfy himself that all possible sources
of disturbance are absent. Even the presence of small objects, as iron
nails in the support on which the compass is placed, or of knives or
keys in the observer’s pockets, may cause serious errors of unknown
magnitude.

Clouds.
The proportion of sky covered with cloud is to be observed. This is-
done by estimation, the scale adopted being 0 to 10; 0 indicating a cloud-
less sky, and 10, a sky which is completely covered with cloud or overcast.
It is also desirable to note the kind of cloud prevalent at the time, and'
the direction from which it is moving.
The different modifications and forms of clouds as adopted by the-
International Committee are as follows:
Cirrus ( Gi .), *Gode A. —Detached clouds, delicate and fibrous-looking,
taking the form of feathers, generally of a white colour, sometimes-
arranged in belts which cross a portion of the sky in “great circles,”
and, by an effect of perspective, converge towards one or two opposite-
points of the horizon (the Ci.-S., and the Ci.Cu. often contribute to the-
formation of these belts).
Cirro-stratus (Ci.-S.), *Gode B. —A thin, whitish sheet, at times
completely covering the sky, and only giving it a whitish appearance
(it is then sometimes called Cirro-nebula), or at others presenting, more;
or less distinctly, a formation like a tangled web. This sheet often pro-
duces halos around the sun and moon.
Cirro-cumulus (Ci.-Cu.), *Gode G. —Small globular masses or white
flakes without shadows, or having very slight shadows, arranged in groups
and often in lines.
Alto-cumulus (A.-Cu.), *Code D. —Largish globular masses, white or
greyish, partially shaded, arranged in groups or lines, and often so
closely packed that their edges appear confused. The detached masses
are generally larger and more compact (changing to S.tCu.) at the centre
of the group; at the margin they form into finer flakes (changing to *
Ci.-Cu.). They often spread themselves out in lines in one or two direc-
tions.
* Letters A, B, C, &c., refer to the plates on the Cloud Chart, which should he framed and hung in a
convenient place for constant reference.


Alto-stratus (.4.-$.), *Code E. —A thick sheet of a grey or bluish colour,
which shows a brilliant patch in the neighbourhood of the sun or moon,
and which, without causing halos, may give rise to coronae. This form
goes through all the changes like the Cirro-stratus, but by measurements
made at Upsala, its altitude is one-half less.
Strato-cumulus ( S.-Cu .), *Code F. —Large globular masses or rolls of
dark cloud, frequently covering the whole sky, especially in winter, and
occasionally giving it a wavy appearance. The layer of Strato-cumulus
is not, as a rule, very thick, and patches of blue sky are often visible
through the intervening spaces. A 1 sorts of transitions between this form
and the Alto-cumulus are noticeable. It may be distinguished from
Nimbus by its globular and rolled appearance, and also because it does
not bring rain.
Nimbus (A.), *Code G. —Rain-cloud. A thick layer of dark clouds,
without shape and with ragged edge, from which continued rain or snow
generally falls. Through the openings of these clouds an upper layer of
Cirro-stratus or Alto-stratus may almost invariably be seen. If the layer
of Nimbus separates up into shreds, or if small loose clouds are visible
floating at a low level, underneath a large Nimbus, they may be described
as Fracto-nimbus (the “ Scud ” of sailors).
Cumulus {Cu.), *Code H . —Wool-pack clouds. Thick clouds of which the
upper surface is dome-shaped and exhibits protuberances, while the base
is horizontal. These clouds appear to be formed by a diurnal ascensional
movement which is not always observable. When the cloud is opposite the
sun, the surfaces usually presented to the observer have a greater brilli-
ance than the margins of the protuberances. When the light falls aslant,
these clouds give deep shadows; when, on the contrary, the clouds are on
the same side of the sun, they appear dark, with bright edges. The true
Cumulus has clear upper and lower limits. It is often broken up by
strong winds, and the detached portions undergo continual changes.
These may be distinguished by the name of Fracto-cumulus (*Code N).
Cumulus-nimbus ( Cu.-N .), *Code I. —The thunder cloud; shower cloud.
Heavy masses of cloud, rising in the form of mountains, turrets, or
anvils, generally having a sheet or screen of fibrous appearance above
(“ false Cirrus ”), and underneath a mass of cloud similar to Nimbus.
From the base there usually fall local showers of rain or snow (occasion-
ally hail or soft hail). Sometimes the upper edges have the compact form
of Cumulus, forming into massive peaks, round which the delicate “ false
Cirrus ” floats, and sometimes the edges themselves separate into a fringe
of filament similar to that of the Cirrus cloud. This last form is par-
ticularly common in spring showers. The front of thunder clouds of wide
extent frequently presents the form of a large bow spread over a portion
of the sky, which is uniformly brighter in colour.
Stratus (S.), *Code K. —A horizontal sheet of lifted fog. When this
sheet is broken up into irregular shreds by the wind, or by the summits of
mountains, it may be distinguished by the name of Fracto-stratus
(*Code L).
A cloud mirror or nephoscope is sometimes used for observing the
direction of movement of the clouds, and ascertaining they* rate of motion.
• Letters A, B, C, &0., refer to the plates on the Cloud Chart, whichfshould be framed and hung in a
convenient place for constant reference.


Observers who are able to devote time to the study of the clouds should
pay attention to the following points and enter the same in the register:
1. The kind of cloud. Indicated by the international letters of the
name of the cloud.
2. The direction from which the clouds come. 1 If the observer
remains perfectly still for several seconds, the movement of the
clouds may be easily observed, in relation to a steeple or pole
erected in an open space. If the movement of the cloud is very
slow, the head should be steadied by using a rest. This method
of observing must only be used for clouds near the zenith, for
if they are distant from it, perspective may lead to errors. In
such cases the nephoscope should be used,
3. The point of radiation of the upper clouds. These clouds often
take the form of narrow parallel lines, which by reason of per-
spective appear to issue from a given point on the horizon. The
“ point of radiation ” is the name given to the point where
these belts or their prolongations meet the horizon.
4. Undulated clouds. It often happens that the clouds have the
appearance of regular striae, parallel and equidistant, like waves
on the surface of water. This is mostly the case with the
Cirro-cumulus, Strato-cumulus (roll Cumulus), &c. It is im-
portant to note the direction of these striae. When two systems
are apparent, as is often seen in clouds separated into globular
masses by striae in two directions, the directions of these two
systems should be noted. As far as possible, these observations
should be taken of striae near the zenith, so as to avoid errors
caused by perspective.
5. The density and situation of a bank of Cirrus. The upper clouds
often assume the form of a tangled web or sheet, more or less
dense, which, as it appears above the horizon, looks like a thin
bank of a light or greyish colour. As this form of cloud is
closely connected wtih barometrical depressions, it is necessary
to observe:—(a) The density. For this, the scale should be
o—very thin and irregular; I—thin, but regular; 2—fairly
thick; 3 —thick; and 4—very thick and of a dark colour.
(6) The direction in which the sheet or bank appear thickest.
6. Remarks.—All interesting particulars should be noted, such as:
(a) During summer all low clouds, as a rule, assume special
forms, resembling, more or less, the Cumulus. In such cases
an entry should be made in the “ Remarks ” Stratus or Nimbus
Cumuliformis. ( b ) It sometimes happens that a cumulus
presents a mammillated lower surface. This appearance should
be noted under the name of Mammato-cumulus. (c) It should
always be noted whether the clouds seem to be stationary or im
very rapid motion.
r Weather.
In addition to the foregoing observations, it is very desirable to note-
the state of the weather and any phenomena that may have occurred since-
the last observation, such as thunderstorms, halos, fog, snow, &c. These
may be entered in the register and on the monthly return sheet, in an
abbreviated form by the letters of Beaufort’s notation, or by the Inter-
national symbols, as follows :

TABLE FOR DETERMINING THE RELATIVE HUMIDITY FROM THE READINGS OF THE DRY AND WET BULB
THERMOMETERS.


A Glossary of Meteorological Terms.
Accumulated Temperature. This is the
combined amount and duration of the
excess or defect of the air temperature
above or below the base temperature
of 42°. It is considered that the tem-
perature above that value is mainly
effectual in starting and maintaining
the growth and in completing the
ripening of agricultural crops.
Actinometer. An instrument for measur-
ing the intensity of solar radiation.
Adiabatic. The relation of the changes
which occur in the pressure, volume,
and temperature of a mass of gas,
which is subject to the condition that
it neither parts with, nor receives,
heat during the process.
After-glow. The radiance or glow seen in
the western sky for a longer period
than usual after the sun has set.
Alto-Cumulus. See Cloud?, p. 13.
Alto-Stratus. See Clouds, p. 13.
Auemo-Clinograph. An instrument for re-
cording the angular deviations of wind
movement from a horizontal path, or
from one parallel to the surface of the
ground.
Anemogram. The trace marked on paper
by an anemograph.
Anemograph. A self-recording anemome-
ter.
Anemometer. An instrument for measur-
ing the pressure or velocity of the
wind.
Anemoscope. An instrument for recording
the direction of the wind.
Aneroid. An instrument consisting essen-
tially of an elastic metal box, exhausted
of air, which indicates on a dial the
changes due to variations of external
pressure on the box, and therefore
acting as a barometer.
Aneroidograph. A self-recording aneroid
barometer.
