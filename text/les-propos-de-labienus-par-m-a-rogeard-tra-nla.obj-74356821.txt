LES PROPOS DE LABIENUS,*
PAR A. ROGEARD.
(Fublished in Far is after the appear ante of the ?History of Julius Ccesar," by
Louis Napoleon.)
In the seventh year after the Christian era?the thirty-eighth year of the reign of
Augustus) and seven years before his death?the world was in full royalism, the sove-
reign people had a master. Slowly emerging from the vapour of blood which empurpled
its dawn, the star of Julius ascended, and shed a soft light over the silent forum.
It was a grand period. The curia was mute, and the laws held their peace: no
more comitia curiata, or centuriata; no more rogations, no more provocations, no more
secessions, no more plebiscita, no more elections, no more disorder, no more of the army
of the republic, nulla publica arma; everywhere, Eoman peace conquered from the
Romans : one sole tribune, Augustus ; one sole army, the array of Augustus; one single
will, his; one sole consul, he; one single censor, he again; one only praetor, he?
always he.
Proscribed eloquence was perishing in the shade of the schools ; literature expired
under the protection of Maecenas ; Livy ceased to write ; Laheo to speak; to read Cicero
was forbidden society was saved.
As for glory, there was some of that, no doubt, as becomes an empire which respects
itself. There had been a good deal of laying about on all sides; people had been soundly
beaten on the north and the south, the right and the left; there were names for the
corners of the streets, and for triumphal arches; vanquished nations were shown in
chains on bas-reliefs; there were Dalmatians, Cantabrians, Aquitanians, and Pannonians;
Illyrians, Rhcetians, Yindelicians, Salassians, and Dacians : the �bians and the Sicambri,
and the Parthians (the dream of Caesar), without counting the Romans of the civil wars
over whom Augustus had had the audacity to triumph contrary to custom?hut on horse-
back only, by way of modesty.
There had even been one of these wars in which the Emperor commanded in person,
and was wounded, which is indeed the height of glory for a great nation.
Meanwhile, money was showered upon the people; the prince multiplied his dis-
tributions?it might be said that this cost him nothing; he distributed, distributed,
distributed ; he was so gracious that he even gave to little children under eleven years,
contrary to law. It is a fine thing to violate the law, when one is better than the law.
As for sight-seeing, a good time had begun. There was only too much to choose
from?theatricals, shows of gladiators, games of the forum, games of the amphitheatre,
games of the circus, games of the comitia, nautical games, and Trojan games; without
reckoning races, hunting, and the contests of the athletes, and without prejudice to
exhibitions of the rhinoceros, of tigers, and of serpents fifty cubits long.
Never had the Roman people been so amused.

pamphlet satirising Napoleon the Third and his system in the shape of a satire upon the ? Histoire

however, he had taken the precaution, immediately after publishing his clever and bitter pamphlet,
to put the Belgian frontier between himself and the imperial author whom he satirised. His pub*.

Add that the prince frequently reviewed the knights, and was fond of repeating
the ceremony of seeing them pass in defile?a majestic spectacle, if not varied, and one
which it would he unjust to omit in enumerating the pleasures of which he was so
prodigal to the masters of the world.
As for him, his pleasures were simple, and except that, perhaps, he too often gave
the lawful place of Scribonia or of Livia, to .Brasilia, to Tertulla, to Terentilla, to Rufilla,
to Salvia Titiscenia, or others; and that he had the bad taste in the midst of famine,
to banquet over-joyously, disguised as a god, with eleven companions deified like himself;
and that he was rather too passionately fond of fine furniture and beautiful Corinthian
vases?sometimes to the extent of killing the owner to obtain the vase; and that he was
a gambler to the core, and was always slightly prone to the vice of his uncle ; and that,
becoming fastidious in his old age, he would admit only virgins to his intimacy, and
that the care of procuring them was confided by him to his wife Livia (who, by the
way, acquitted herself with great zeal in this little matter); if it had not been for this,
and some lighter performances which are scarcely worth mentioning, Suetonius assures
us that?in everything else?his life was well regulated and above reproach.
It was a happy epoch, then, this Julian era; this age of Augustus was a great-
age ; and it was not without reason that Virgil?a little plundered at first, but subse-
quently compensated?exclaimed that the reign of Saturn had returned.
There was, indeed, here and there, a shadow over the scene. There had been some
ten conspiracies and as many seditions, and this rather damages a reign.
It was the Republicans who reappeared.
As many as could be killed had been put out of the way, at Pharsalia, at Thapsus,
at Munda, at Philippi ,at Actium, at Alexandria, and in Sicily; for Roman liberty died
hard; not less than seven great slaughterings?seven massacres?were required to
dispose of them.
The legions seemed to rise from the earth at Pompey?s will, and these ever-reviving
republicans had been always conscientiously destroyed:?but how many ? Three hun-
dred thousand, perhaps, altogether; this was well, but it was not enough ; some were
left yet. Hence some little contrarieties in the life of a great man. In the senate he
was obliged to have cuirass and' sword beneath his robe (which is uncomfortable,
especially in a hot country), and to surround himself with ten stout fellows, whom he
called his friends, and who were nevertheless troublesome company for him.
There were also three cohorts who carried their weapons behind him, in that same
city into which, sixty years before, it was not lawful to enter with a small knife ; and
this might breed some doubts as to the popularity of the father of his country.
Then there was Agrippa, who was rather too destructive; hut it was needful to
build a marble sepulchre for this great people which was determined to die.
There was also the prefect of Lyons, Licinius, who pressed too heavily on his
province : he knew not how to shear the animal without making it cry out; he was an
ignorant and clumsy administrator, who contented himself with grasping the money
where he found it?in people?s pockets ?who worked without address, and wanted genius
in execution. It was he who proposed to add two months to the calendar, so that he
might twice more in the year exact the monthly impost in his good city. However, it
must be admitted that he fairly shared with his master the fruits of his administration.
The good people of Lyons, not knowing how to shake off such a bloodsucker, were
simple enough to petition to Caesar for the recall of their prefect. He was retained.
There was also a certain distant expedition of which one could not be quite proud;
the unlucky Varus had been stupid enough to be crashed with three legions, away some-
where beyond the Rhine, in the Hercynian forest. This did not look well.
War is like all good things, it must not be abused. I admit that it has the praise
of being an absorbing spectacle, the most attractive of diversions, but it is a resource
that requires management. One must not too lightly play this insolent and terrible
game, which can turn upon him who plays it; and when one is a saviour, it is scarcely
becoming to send too lightly to the slaughter the people whom one has saved. This
might be said ; but who thought of it then ? Hardly twenty thousand mothers, and what
is that in a great empire P
One knows well that glory does not give favours, and Rome was rich enough in
blood and treasure to pay for them. Augustus got over the difficulty by quietly
knocking his head against the wall, and by composing a prosopopoeia, which has since
become classic.


Lastly, there was Lollius, who lost an eagle ?but that might be passed over; and
as for the finances, a new era was opened, a great administration scheme was invented?
the world was to be administered. The empire, monster ?with a hundred million hands
and one belly?unity, is established!
I will work with your hands, and you shall digest with my stomach. You see how
plain this is, and Menenius was quite right, and I need not trouble myself about the
feelings of the peasants on the Danube.
If the system had some abuses, if occasionally there was a famine, this was hut a
small cloud amidst the beaming of the general joy, a jarring note which was lost in the
concert of public thankfulness ; and all those small discomforts which casually ruffled the
surface of the empire, were, truth to say, but happy contrasts, agreeable diversions tor
a people, fortunately accorded to it to enable it to rest in its enjoyment, and to give it
time to breathe; they were, so to speak, the seasoning to the sumptuous repast, just
enough to break the monotony of success, to temper pleasures, and to prevent satiety.
The people were surcharged with prosperity. There are benefits which overwhelm,
happinesses which kill.
Who, then, in this golden age, could complain ? Tacitus tells us that seven years later,
when Augustus died, there remained but few citizens who had seen the republic ; there
were still less who had served it. They had been carried off by the_ civil wars, or by
proscriptions, or by summary executions, or by assassination, or by imprisonment, or
by exile, by misery, or by despair. Time had done the rest. There were left but some
sour spirits, some morose old men; and as for those who had come into the world after
the battle of Actium, they were all born with the image of the emperor in the eye ; and
if they saw no clearer for that, there was at least room for hope that they would he
disposed to think well of the new state of affiars, and even to consider it the best of all
possible conditions, since they had never seen any other. Thus the herd of Remus was
content, and all was for the best in the best of empires.
At this time lived Labienus. Do you know Labienus ? He was a strange creature,
of singular humour. Picture to yourself his obstinacy in remaining a citizen in a city
where none but subjects remained. Can you conceive this? Civis Romanus sum, he
would say. It was impossible to get him out of that. He wished, like Cicero, to die
free in his free country. Can you imagine such extravagance ? Citizen and free ! The
fool! Doubtless he said this, as Polyeucte afterwards said ?lam a Christian. with-
out knowing well what he said. The truth is that his poor head was out of order ; he
was touched with a dangerous affection of the brain; such, at least, was the opinion of
the Emperor?s physician, the celebrated Artorius, who called this kind of folly a
ratiocinative monomania, and who prescribed treatment for it in prison. Labienus had
not followed the prescription, and he was by no means cured, as you will see when 1
have made you better acquainted with him.
Titius Labienus bore a name already twice made illustrious by good citizens. The
first Labienus, Cmsar?s lieutenant, had left him after the passing of the Rubicon, so as
not to be an accomplice in his crime ; the second preferred the service of the Parthians
to that of the triumvirate; our hero was the third. One line from feeneca the rhetorician
suffices even now to give us a glimpse of this grand figure, for we there find this proud
speech of Labienus:?" I know that what I write can only be read after my death.
Orator and historian of the first rank, acquiring glory in spite of a thousand obstacles,
it was said of him that he had seized rather than obtained admiration. He wrote a
history, of which, with closed doors, he read some pages to his safe friends. Specially
for this history the sentencing of books to the flames was applied for the first time, on
the motion of a senator who himself was smitten, some time afterwards, by the punish-
ment which he had invented, and thus Labienus was the first in Rome to receive the honour,
afterwards more common, of an incendiary senatus~consultm. It is this which Monsieur
Effo?er judiciously styles " new historical difficulties begotten by the Imperial system. *
�� The poor historian, thus condemned to the flames, unable to survive his work, scut
himself up in the tomb of his ancestors, never to emerge from it. He thought his
work annihilated. It was not. Cassius knew it by heart, and Cassius, sheltered by
exile, was, as he said himself, a living edition of the work of his friend an edition
which they would not burn. ~ . , , , , ,
Without doubt, the death of Labienus was as ridiculous as his life. A burnt book
a pretty affair! would one kill oneself for that ? The senate did not will the death ot
the sinner; it wished only to give him a caution. He ought to have profited by it; but

this man took everything the wrong way, and when he did understand, always under-
stood at cross purposes. He was worthy to figure in the long array of stoical suicides
which had then commenced, and amongst all those foolish heroes, all those systematic
and obstinate opponents, intemperate and ridiculous, who made a last act of resistance
even of their death, and imagined that in opening their veins they were doing a shrewd
turn to the Emperor. Some even killed themselves for the sole purpose of enraging
the prince, who laughed at them amongst his freedmen, and was all the more convinced
of the correctness of his policy, seeing that in this way his business managed itself.
Lahienus was one of these; you see that he was an imbecile. Such was the man
whose conversation we propose to relate to you, and you will see that in his language,
as in his life and in his death, he was always the same?that is to say, incorrigible.
He was a man of an old party, since liberty had passed away; a re-actionary, since the
republic was a thing of by-gone time; a remnant of the ancient rule, since the government
of the law was the rule of a former time; in a word, he was?a blockhead.
He was one of those bad folks who have need to tremble under a strong Govern-
ment, in order that the good may be re-assured, and society, shaken to its foundations,
may settle itself on its bases. This is not all; Lahienus was ungrateful. In full Csesarism,
in full glory, in the midst of this superabundance of public happiness, and of this
immense feast for the human race, he misunderstood the benefits which were scattered
with hand by the second founder of Home, the pacificator of the world; he had
blind passions, and, at the same time, those hostile passions which make dangerous men
and disastrous citizens.
But you don?t know him yet. His passion craving air and space by the extinction
of the principate, he?being neither able to speak, nor write, nor act, nor move?passed
whole hours on the Sublician bridge (watching the Tiber flow), moveless and silent, but
?with aspect fierce and menacing gesture, his bosom swelling with the spirit of ancient
days, like a statue of avenging Mars, ?like a petrified tribune.
It is sweet to sleep, said Michael Angelo, or to be of stone, while misery and shame
endure. Lahienus did not sleep, hut he was of stone harder than the rock of the
Capitol. Tyranny had no hold upon him, and the fangs of the empire could not rend
him. He was a Roman of the old flint, against which nothing could prevail. Alone,
erect, like Codes, between an army and a precipice, he defied the one and the other; ?
he defied Augustus and smiled at death. In all this there was something good, if you
choose; but on the other hand, what an odious character and perverse spirit!
In vain Octavius had struck a handsome medal, with the three hands of the
triumvirs interlaced, and this sublime inscription, ? The salvation of the human race.?
This even displeased Lahienus ; he pretended that it had been saved in spite of itself,
and cited this verse of Horace :
? He who would save me ?gainst my will,
Is but the ruffian who would kill.?
The old Lahienus was one of those who had seen the republic; this was not his
fault, but he had the folly to think of it?that was the mischief. He had before him a
great reign, and he was not content. There are some people who never are content.
He thought himself always on the morning after Pharsalia; forty years of glory
glared upon his eyes without opening them ; he had the air of a man who was troubled
with bad dreams, and the reality was to him only an infernal vision. He was the
subject of grotesque surprises; he would not believe what had happened. Epimenides
(who slept a hundred years), when he woke, was less astonished.
Sorrowful amidst universal joy, gloomy amidst Homan revelry, he was there, and
he seemed to he elsewhere ;he was a spectre at a feast; you would have said that he was
a dead man escaped from the tombs of Philippi, an inquisitive ghost who came to look
on. Sometimes a friend grieved for him; he?he grieved for his friend. Oftener,
alone, he growled in a corner; he watched the progress of the empire. It was hardly
possible to make such a man understand reason; he was of another age, exiled into a
new one; he had home-sickness for the past; he had learnt nothing, forgotten nothing;
he knew nothing of the present epoch; he had all the prejudices of Brutus ; he was
infected with Greek opinions which had not been current in Rome for a long time. He
had an air as antique as the Twelve Tables ; he thought always as people thought in
the time of Fahricius, and the long-haired Camilli.
And then, such fantastic notions, such inconceivable folly! taste so utterly whimsical,
strange, and inexplicable! he loved liberty! Evidently Lahienus had not common
sense. To love liberty ! Do you understand that? this was retrograde, since liberty
was an ancient thing. Hew men loved the new system. He had no perception of
lights and shades, no notion of time, no sense of transitions.


. Time had moved on, ideas also; he remained fixed like a boundary; he still
believed in justice, in the laws, in science, and in conscience; clearly he raved. Like
Cicero, he spoke of the duty of honourable men ; he spoke of the senate, of the tribunes,
of the comitia, and did not see that all these things had melted away like snow in the
great sewer, and that he was, almost alone, on the brink.
He still reckoned the years by the consuls; for Augustus had left the name to make
people believe in the existence of the thing; and Labienus hoped, by preserving the
name, to revive the thing . �
He prepared addresses to the people, as if there was a people; he invoked the laws
as if there were any laws ; the empire was, to him, only an historical parenthesis,?a
shameful page in the Roman annals; he longed to turn the leaf or to tear it out; he
always said it would come to an end, and he believed so; people thought him a down-
right fool, and he was, as you see.
For the rest, a good sort of man ; queer, rather than wicked; he could not kill a
cmcken, or wish the least harm to anyone except Augustus; and yet he was so gentle
that he would only have sent him to the reformatory, the tread-mill; ?in opposition to
the general opinion, which would have condemned him to the cross.
? 4. moreover, with the Stoics, that punishment is good for a criminal. It
is true, therefore, that he desired the only good thing that could happen to Augustus
atonement. ,
One day, as he walked in the Portico of Agrippa, he met Gallio.
. Junius Gallic was a wise young man, as Labienus was an old fool. He was a
serious and agreeable young man?accomplished, elegant, well-mannered, circumspect,
and prudent?-a moderate fetoic Spanish and Roman, citizen and subject, a man of two
epochs and of two countries, half-blooded, double-minded, a little of this and a little of
that; sometimes, like Horace, turning a softened glance upon the tomb of liberty, and
then bringing it back not less tenderly to the cradle of the empire?giving a tear to
Cato, a smile to Caesar : a benevolent character, loving everybody a little, even Labienus.
He was a brother of Seneca, who dared not to live, and uncle of Lucan, who knew
not how to die.
-There was nothing more left at that time than chips of heroism and splinters of
greatness?a people in ruins before its temples?here and there still some half-Romans.
... a ~.� made rhymes for the favourite of Maecenas?the critics call him the ingenious
Gailio. In fine, he had ability, for he was proconsul. After him, those who were
indifferent in religious_concerns were called Gallionists. He would be as little patron-
izmg in the same way in political matters. Labienus reproached him for this. And I
think that the gloomy saunterer was passing him without caring to recognize him, for
Labienus was not agreeable. He was scarcely more affable than those famous senators
who proudly sitting in the midst of the forum, once upon a time so coldly received
the Gauls. Neither would Gallio have ventured to touch Labienus by the beard ; but
the young fellow was so pleased, so excited, was se anxious to find some one to whom he
could tell the great piece of news he had heard, and was so curious to see its effect on
d?yc 1 (lo U ? S ?? t iat ??Good-day, Titus, quid agis, dulcissime rerum ? How
?Badly, if the empire does well.?
? All right; it is well known that you are always in a bad humour; but I have
news to tell you.
? There can be no news for me while Augustus still reigns.?
? ?? Co ?�> 1 know you?ve been in a rage these thirty years, and have not smiled once
sincere triumvirate. But hear my news?the Memoirs of Augustus have just come
? Since when have robbers taken to writing books ? ?
? Since honest people became Emperors.?
?Alas!? r
? So, my dear Titus, you won?t read these Memoirs ? ?
h a iem ? Gfi�liO) I will read them, weeping for shame at them.?
an Anti-Cato ? ? anSWer them ? criticise them , write an Anti-Caesar, as Ctesar wrote
? ~ f�> Gallio ? I will publish nothing on the subject. I dispute not with the master
of thirty legions; in a country which is not free it ought to be forbidden to approach
contemporary history, and criticism, in like manner, is impossible ? 11
? Won?t you enlighten the public ???


� I -will not help to deceive them ; for in these times on such subjects, nothing which
appears can he good, nothing which is good can appear. I will continue writing my
secret history, and will send a few leaves to Severus in a safe place. I will save the
truth hy banishing it.?
? But we are told that criticism shall he free. Tyranny will allow eight days?
liberty to literature.?
? They could hut give a sham liberty, a liberty of December, that is to say a
liberty of the Carnival, libertas Decembris as Horace has it; I will not make use of it.
I would not, hy writing against the book, place myself between the vengeance of Octavius
and the clemency of Augustus, without even a choice between them. I would not, like
Cinna, give the knave the opportunity of doing the magnanimous, and thus be victimized
by his favours. As for praising the hook, I can only do that if it is good, in which case
I should fear to be confounded with those who praise it with other motives. It is there-
fore as impossible for me to praise as to blame it. And, besides, the book is not good,
and cannot be so. When a man is criminal enough to make himself king, and fool
enough to make himself God, I believe that he could not have all the requisite qualities
for writing history. You know already that he has neither good sense nor good faith.
What, then, has he left ? He can neither know the truth, nor say it if he knew it.
With what, then, does this sceptre-bearer meddle ? What prompts him to write ? An
historian king ought to begin by abdicating. He has not done so?a bad sign. And
then, I have read some passages. He justifies the proscriptions, and apologizes for
usurpation. This is as it should be. And you wish, Gallic, that I should criticise this
labour of ignorance and of falsehood, clothed with the approbation two thousand
centurions, and recommended by veteran legions to the reader! Criticism ! it is the
judgment-seat that you ought to say. Do you not see, my little Gallic, that this is
one of the shrewdest tricks that this son of the banker has played with the sons of the
wolf, who, alas! know not how to bite like their ancestress. Ah! Gallic, we are
degenerate, we are Romans in decay, fallen from Caesar to Augustus, from Charybdis
into Scylla; from force to trickery, and from the uncle to the nephew ! Pho! No! I
will not be entrapped in this literary ambuscade, nor fall into the snare, and above all,
I will not cause others to fall into it. No; I will not write on the Memoirs of Augustus.
The silence of the people is a lesson for kings. Labienus will give that lesson to Augustus.
?Be at your ease, moreover: if you wish for criticisms upon this little morsel of
imperial literature, if you wish for fine appreciations, you will have plenty of them.
If you wish for wise dissertations, there will he showers of them. If you want
ingenious and pointed observations, views full of novelty, elegant and courteous dis-
cussions sustained in an exquisite strain by people of the highest circles, you will have
them ; if you wish for controversy with bended knee and rhetoric grovelling in the dust;
for epigrammatic surprises, whose point tickles instead of piercing; for bites which are
caresses; for deadly reproaches which give pleasure ; for worshipful crouchings gleaming
adroitly under the appearance of a grave judgment; for pretty little words, thoroughly
pleasant, delicately wrapped up in the folds of a savage and harsh phrase; for bouquets
of flowers of Latinity; for streams of honeyed eloquence; for arguments offered up on
velvet cushions ; for objections presented on a silver platter, like a letter by a servant?
nothing of this sort will be wanting, my dear Gallio; we shall have the chorus of the
muses of the state figuring away, and Maecenas will lead the ballet. The chaste sisters
have left Pindus for Mount Palatine, and Apollo has entered the police. Thus Augustus
is sure of a public, of readers, of judges, of critics, of copyists, and of commentators.
He will find people for his work. He who has made Virgils can make Aristarchuses; he
wants them and he will have them.
? Already the literary world is in ecstacy. Yarius weeps for joy, Flavus flutters
with tenderness, Rabirius is getting his tablets ready, Hater ins will give a lecture,
Tarpa will make a declamation, Pompeius Macer declares that it is a great day for
morality, and orders three gorgeous copies for the three public libraries which he has
just established; Fenestella is about to add a volume to his literary history; Metellus,
?who composes so well the prince?s speeches, will count up the oratorical beauties of his
book, and Yerrius the grammarian, the grammatical beauties ; Marathus, the historio-
grapher, will make an analysis of it in the Court Journal ; and Athenodorus, the
hanger-on of Octavia, will arrange a paraphrase for the ladies, with little notes accom-
modated to the understanding of the princesses. Here are ten of them ; I know of a
thousand: thtse people will go brawling in review before the Emperor, like the knights
on parade; he, in the meantime, will wear an aspect full of modesty and majesty; his
gesture will say ? Enough ! ? his smiles will say 1 More ! ? and the crowd will scream till
they are hoarse.


? As he has had the herd of the Seven Hills to applaud his acts, he will have the
herd of authors to praise his book. The applause is sure, but it can only come from one
side, and this is only a consequence arising grotesquely enough from his singular literary
situation.
? The unfortunate fellow perhaps could not foresee this, but I am amused at it.
lie will succeed, of course?by command; that is hard, but I can?t help it. Omnipotence
has inconveniences for an author; the path is not all flowers in the way of a crowned
writer. The post is not tenable, and Virgil would have lost his Latin in it. But one
must submit to the law one has accepted, and when the cup of shame is poured out, it
must be drunk. Attention, then, my dear Gallio ; the ceremony begins; it will he loud
sounding and crowded; the musicians are in their places, tuning their instruments and
preluding tiie concert; look, then, and listen, if it is to your taste; I confess that the
spectacle will be enjoyable enough for those who still can smile.
? I know that the work will comprise the last civil war, and even the last year of
Julius Caesar. In good faith, my dear Gallio, can you take this seriously ? Augustus
publishing a book upon the revolution which he has made ! What would you say of a
criminal publishing an apology for his crime ? To my thinking he is guilty of a second
outrage, more difficult, indeed, than the first (for it is easier to commit a crime than to
justify it); but the second offence, if more difficult, is also more criminal and mischievous,
for the victims are more numerous, the consequences more lasting.
? The first attacks the lives of men, the second their consciences; the one kills the
body, the other the spirit; the one oppresses the present, the other the future. It is
the ? coup d'etat in morality, the creation of disorder, systematized injustice, the
organization of evil, the promulgation of wrong, the proscription of truth, the final
defeat of public reason, the general overthrow of ideas, an intellectual battle of Actium.
It is the true crowning of the edifice (couronnement d?un edifice) of wickedness and
infamy, and it is also the only possible one.
?The book of Augustus is his life set up for an example, his ambition condoned,
his will formulated into law; it is the code of malefactors, and the Bible of rascals;
and it is such a book as this that you would publicly criticise under the control of his
good pleasure!
? Would you make a literary opposition to Augustus ? Have with you! Criticism
against Octavius! how r absurd! He did not criticise Cicero, he killed him! What!
the wretch who assassinates you, makes a speech to you about his murders, and,
before finishing you, asks your opinion on his little composition?your sincere opinion,
there and then, on the matter and the manner?your literary and political opinion, for
he is an artist and a good fellow, and he wants to know your opinion on his work;
and you would meekly give it to him, and would blindly converse with your
executioner, with his knife at your throat! My dear Gallio! you don?t mean it.
? What would you think of Yerres writing a book upon property? Would you
discuss it with him ? Are the Memoirs of Octavius anything else ? Is it not the
theory of usurpation written by an usurper? It is a school of conspiracy opened
by an unpunished conspirator.
?After all, the author can only tell what he knows; he knows how to pillage
a city, to cut the throats of senators, to rifle the treasury of a temple, and to rob Jupiter;
he knows how to make false keys, false oaths, and false wills; he knows how to lie, in
the forum and in the curia ; to corrupt the electors, or to do without them ;to kill his
wounded colleagues, as at Modena; to proscribe wholesale, with other royal tricks.
After the plan of the first Caesar, he knows how to borrow from some to lend to others,
and thus to make friends on both sides ; he knows how, with a vigorous spring, to over-
leap all harriers and all Rubicons, and then with a last bound, careering over all laws,
human and divine, to make the perilous jump, to turn a somersault?and come down king.
? He knows all this, hut he knows not one word of history, nor of politics, nor of
morality, except the great morality, that is to say, the morality of the great as taught in
his family.
? One finds nothing, then, in this book which one wants to know, and everything in
profusion which it is dangerous to learn.
? He loves old words, old coins, and old helmets, but he loves not old manners.
?Would you discuss with him any question in grammar, archaeology, or numismatics?
Fool! to do him such honour. You must see that this would be to fall into his snare,
and to play his game.
?Do what they may, people of this sort feel that they are under the ban of
society. They have violently broken from it by crime, they would re-enter it sidy by
trickery.


?They have only one ambition, to work themselves back again amongst honest
people. To do this they take all disguises; they go about, seeking everywhere their
poor lost honour: one sees them, crowned mendicants, begging esteem at every door:
?it is the only alms which one cannot give them. Augustus is one of these; this
drinker of blood has only one thirst?for praise; this robber of the empire of the
world wishes only to steal one thing now?his rehabilitation.
? But he aims at an impossibility.
? The impotent and desperate attempt which he makes to save some fragments
of his ship-wrecked reputation; this last effort to retrieve his honour when the last
branch is breaking under him; this last struggle of Caesar against the pressure of
public opinion, has something melancholy and comic, like the last grimace of the
criminal on the gallows, or like the smile of the gladiator who wishes to die with
grace.
? The hook of Caesar is the toilet of the condemned; it is the salute of the criminal
to the crowd as he goes to execution. It is the coquetry of the last day.
? Caesar was so filthy that the executioner would have had nothing to do with
him; he cleanses himself to embrace death.
? And he asks for readers! Insolence! readers for Caesar ? "What for? He dares,
in his preface, to address questions to readers; but the licior will reply for him.?
? In expectation of this reply, I will read the Memoirs of Augustus
?And I,? replied Labienus, ?will read again the Letters of Cassius.?
