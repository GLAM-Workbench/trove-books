PREFACE.
My object in compiling tlie matter under this cover is to
give information to people who have not travelled to the lands
of the Barcoo, famous by name even in England for the beautiful
quality of wool produced on its downs—downs which are
counted by hundreds and thousands of miles—and which are
almost exclusively occupied by a few large companies, the prin-
cipals of which chiefly live in our colonial cities or abroad.
These lands would prove a veritable gold mine to thousands who
are now coaxing poor land to give them a living, who in this
district would simply have to erect fences and stock the land
with sheep, when the natural increase and the wool produced
would, lam sure, prove far beyond their expectations. There
is no foot-rot, no scab, no Cumberland, and no grass seed, each
one of which annoyances and consequent loss has to be borne in
many other districts I could mention.
There are certainly periodical droughts to contend against,
but not more than in other parts of the colonies, and now that
boring for artesian water has proved a success these droughts
have lost their terror.
I have given an estimate of the expenses and probable
returns from selections of 5,760, 10,240, and 16,000 acres, which
shows as high as 28 per cent, profit. In these estimates I have
made no mention of summer and winter lambing, which is a
regular thing on the Barcoo. A ewe has always a lamb at her
side, and I have allowed a large margin for losses, although the
loss of ewes does not exceeds percent. I may state that I have
had a varied experience on all lands.
I am not quite a native of the Barcoo, being born in Tas-
mania, but I came to Queensland in 1868 when I gained much
experience amongst sheep and wool on the Darling Downs, after
which I went overlanding or droving sheep through New South
Wales, New England, and the western portions of Queensland,


and I must say I saw no better land or better grown sheep than
on the Barcoo. I have landed a mob of six and eight-tooth
sheep in Brisbane, and, after droving them 250 miles and training
two days, they have averaged, when dressed, 58lbs. each. lam
now a selector of ten years’ standing on the Barcoo.
What is known as, or termed, the Barcoo is the country
extending from Tambo to Muttaburra, about 240 miles, including
the following towns : —Tambo, Blackall, Isisford, Barcaldine,
Aramac, Muttaburra, and Forest Grove. Although Muttaburra
and Forest Grove are on the Thompson waters, they are always
recognized as Barcoo towns. Most of the country known as the
Barcoo is first class sheep country, and is at present carrying f
of a sheep to the acre of available land, viz:—Terrick Terrick,
710 miles, carrying about 300,000; Malvern Hills, 482 miles,
about 160,000 ; Aramac, 378 miles, about 150,000; Rodney
Downs, 141 miles, about 75,000.
A considerable portion of the land open has been taken up
by 97 different selectors, the selections varying from 5,000 to
20,000 acres, principally on those stations lying near the railway
and adjacent to old established towns.
The land most suitable for sheep grazing is on the following
runs, viz,—Landsdowne, 12 miles from Tambo, on the head of
the Ward River ; Tambo, near Tambo township, on the Barcoo ;
Greendale, 12 miles down the Barcoo from Tambo.
Most of the available land has been taken up on the above
named runs, some of the first selectors settling round Tambo,
amongst whom were the Brown Bros., who started in a very
small way, but who now write me as follows :
“ We have now almost 60,000 acresand about 15,000 sheep
and contemplate purchasing more. We cannot complain about
the way we have got on, but would recommend intending settlers
to have one or two suitable partners, which makes it all the
cheaper to work two or three selections together.”
The next run is Mount Enniskillen, on which there is a lot
of good country. Enniskillen is on the Barcoo, and about 18
miles from Greendale, and 30 miles from Tambo.
Minnie Downs, a run on Elizabeth Creek, about 30 miles
from Tambo, has also a large quantity of good country, very
little of which has been taken up.
Further down the Barcoo comes Northampton Downs and
Ravensbourne, two stations worked together. Northampton is 25
miles from Blackall and upon it are some very good selections,
mostly dry and not large areas. Ravensbourne is on Station
Creek, about 26 miles back of Barcoo and Northampton ; on this


tliere are several large selections open, most of which are very
scrubby and rough; there is only one of 20,000 acres worth
taking up.
Adjoining Ravensbourne is Lome Run on Hope Creek, dis-
tance about 30 miles from Blackall. This run contains some good
waterholes, and there are several good selections, but at present
they are not available.
Adjoining Lome is Terrick, a large amount of good country,
some of which has been treated the same as Lome, and is not
available at the present time, but, I have no doubt, when the
land is wanted for bona fide settlement it will be available.
Terrick is on Wooroola Creek; there are numerous creeks running
into it, so that water can be easily made.
Adjoining Terrick is Malvern, through which run there are
several creeks, namely, Hope, Ravensbourne, Conway, Thors-
leigli, and Valentine. There are about 70,000 acres of first-
class grazing land open for selection on this run.
On the opposite side of the Barcoo River is Avington Run,
40 miles from Blackall; on this run there is a lot of good land
open and resumed. On the above runs there is plenty of timber
for fencing purposes.
The next runs on the Barcoo in rotation from Blackall are
Portland Downs, 68 miles distant by road, first-class country,
and well watered; Isis Downs, 134 miles of grazing right, good
country and well watered, about 77 miles west of Blackall.
Further on than Isisford township, and within 50 miles of
it, there is a large quantity of good country, suitable for sheep,
viz. :—Emmett Downs, to the south ; Albilbah, down the Barcoo
to the west; Ruthven, north-west; and Westlands, north-north-
west. Taking another line west from Blackall and starting at
Evora, 25 miles to the north-east of Blackall there is some good
country ; joining, that run to the west is Home Creek, most of the
best land being in the leased portion. Again, farther to the west,
At the back of Portland is Wallsliot, a large run on which there
are 561 miles of first-class sheep country resumed for selection.
This run is now well watered by dams and tanks, and there are
several small creeks with fair waterholes. Further west and
north-west of Longreach (the terminus of the Central Railway
line), there are over a million and a quarter acres of splendid
grazing country, but not much timber; mostly high rolling downs;
black and brown soil. On Bowen Downs and Mount Cornish,
situated on Cornish Creek and the Thompson, there is still a lot
of good country —those runs containing 780 miles of grazing
right, not more than one hundred miles of which are taken up.


The following are the selections above 5,000 acres already
taken up :

In the above estimates only one crop of lambs per year lias
been calculated upon, whereas three lambings can be bad in two
years, so that at least 25 per cent, more can be reckoned upon.
The costs depend a good deal on the situation, the amount
of timber available, and the amount of improvements that have
to be paid for. In some cases they amount to twelve or fifteen
hundred pounds, and in exceptional cases even more than this,
but the Selector always gets value for bis money. In one
instance I bad to do with the year’s rent, survey fees and im-
provements came to about one thousand pounds for a 20,000
acre block, but it was all fenced and a dam upon it.
I can confidently say that my estimate is a very moderate
one, this is also the opinion of two large selectors who have
examined them, and whose certificate I append—
“ Having examined the above estimates, we think they are based on a
fair calculation, in fact the sums are rather under estimated than over.”
( J. K. CUDMORE, Tara, Barcaldine.
Signed | El) w c. MANNING, Yandarlo, Tambo.
The following are taken from a pamphlet published by
Messrs. Campbell & Co., Barcaldine, March, 1889.
“ Mr. Campbell has been a resident in the Barcoo country
for over ten years, during which time he has held selections taken
up under the Act of 1864, which selections have now become
freehold. His estimates have been verified by liis personal
expenditure, and he trusts that the result of his experience may
induce more energetic and younger men to select country, which


each year must become valuable, at the same time, he would
like to remind settlers that Queensland is a rainless country, and
droughts—or rather dry seasons—occur with never failing fre-
quency, indeed, the year 1888 has been distinguished by a record
of the smallest quantity of rain recorded during the past nine
years. At the same time, this dry season has had all the sting
taken out of it by the provisions previously made for securing
permanent conservation of water, so that actually the increase
has been as large on the majority of the Central Queensland
stations as in the years of copious rainfall, while, as will be
observed from statistics published elsewhere, the wool clip has
exceeded by 20 per cent, that of any previous season.
The grazing farms in this district consist of areas of country
from 4,000 acres up to 20,000. The rents vary from Id. to 2d.
per acre, according to the quality of the country, distance from
railway, watered or otherwise. There is artesian water to be
obtained at a depth of from 640 to 960 feet. The artesian well
at Barcaldine is 640 feet deep. The water flows over the surface
at the rate of 175,000 gallons per day, and has been running
without cessation for thirteen months. It supplies the railway
and town, and besides filling the creek bed, thus, keeping up a
permanent supply of water for carriers and travelling stock.
The cost of boring and tubing will be about 275. 6d. per foot.
Twenty-one miles from Barcaldine going due west is a second
bore. This is down 960 feet and it flows over the surface at the
rate of 19,000 gallons per day. Sixty-five miles south of Bar-
caldine is the Blackall bore which yields 275,000 gallons per day,
from a depth of 1,600 feet. The cost of boring may therefore be
estimated without much difficulty, and two settlers might com-
bine if the cost appeared too great for one to bear.
The other method of conserving water is by tank sinking.
Sites are easily procurable, and the work can be done now from
Is. per cubic yard. The cost of a 10,000 yard tank would,
therefore, be £SOO, and one tank of this size would be sufficient
for four paddocks of 5,000 acres. Fencing on the selections
adjoining the railway, where the wire can be delivered on the
ground, costs about £32 per mile for six wire sheep proof fenc-
ing. The country has been settled for some years, but upon
those farms opened now for selection there are no improvements
beyond a few miles of fencing of which the new lessee has to pay
half valuation.
It may be mentioned here that the Land Board revise all
valuations if desired, and at the last meeting of the Board in
adjusting valuations on Fraser-Collier selections the Board in


each case upheld the selectors’ valuations as against those of
the former lessees.

£2,546 0 0
To this, of course must be added travelling expenses,
management, cost of working until returns come in, and we
have allowed for only 5,000 sheep. There is abundance of forest
country, making a good run for cattle, which could be obtained
at a lower rental. In starting a 20,000 acre farm we should like
£SOOO of capital, but, doubtless, half that amount would be
sufficient if the grazier is content to commence on a small scale.
We may add that the climate, though the temperature is high
in summer, boasts of cool nights, and is generally reckoned the
healthiest in Queensland. Our families of young children enjoy
robust health, and if change is required, the train goes down in
one day to the invigorating breezes and fresh air of Emu Park,
on the sands of Kepple Bay, the sanitorium of Rockhampton.
We append here statistics concerning wool despatched from
Barcaldine during the year 1888.
The wool despatched during the year 1888 from Barcaldine
station only amounted to 84,984 bales from 29 stations, and the
most of it has been greasy. Compared with the quantity trucked
the previous year it will be noticed there has been a large increase
principally from such stations as Bowen Downs, which sent
8,885 bales this year as compared with 2,460 last year; Barcal-
dine, 2,781 as against 1,781 last year ; Evesham, 2,128 as against
1,525 ; Corona, 1,888 against 566 ; Wellsliot, 8,186 against
2,029; Albilbali, 1,155 against 519, over 100 per cent.; Darr
River Downs, 2,051 against 809 (this, however, is greasy as
against scoured). The total quantity of bales for 1887 was
25,599, and last year it was increased to 34,984 being an increase
of 9,385 bales. This seems an enormus increase, but, of course,
it is difficult to estimate the exact increase of the clip, as three,


if not more, of the stations named which sent clean w T ool down
in 1887, changed to greasy in 1888.
Isis Downs wool, some of which was not in up to the end
of the year, would have brought the total higher this year.
We have no means of ascertaining the quantities sent from
Jericho, Alpha, and Alice, but we believe the returns when pub-
lished w T ill considerably swell the increase. This year the clip
is likely to be considerably heavier, and doubtless w r itli increased
rates of carriage some of the stations may fall back upon the
scouring machines.

The following arc some letters written on the subject of
selection and railway communication :
“ Blackall, 12t l i September , 1890.
“ Mr. E. T. Towner, Blackall.
“Dear Sir, —Referring to your letter of even date I have
not the slightest doubt that the construction of a branch line of
railway to Blackall will become an accomplished fact within the
immediate future. The promise of support already received by
the Blackall Railway League plainly indicates that our claims for
the “ iron horse ” have been recognised in such a manner as to
ensure ultimate success. Many of the leading business men of


Tambo, Isisford, Barcaldine, Rockhampton, and Brisbane have
already signed the petition. The late Colonial Treasurer, Mr.
John Donaldson, when delivering his last financial statement,
complained that most of the branch lines of railways had proved
to be “ suckers; ” but it is easy to show that a line to Blackall
could not be placed under that heading, as the statistics available
afford ample proof that a branch to Blackall would, from the
day of its completion, prove a very valuable “ feeder ” to the
central line.
“ The country which the proposed line would tap is amongst
the best in Australia, the carrying capabilities of many runs and
selections being over a sheep to the acre. In this district the
stock returns are as follows 26,827 cattle, 1,115,293 sheep,
and 8,890 horses. The large increase of traffic, as shown by the
following comparative returns supplied by the Railway Depart-
ment, is ample proof that the trade and consequent settlement of
the district is advancing with rapid strides. The following
figures are taken from the petition adopted by the Railway
League:—
Goods received at the Jericho railway station for Blackall
and runs in the vicinity for 1888 —897 tons, on which the sum
of £5,695 was paid for railway carriage ; 1889 —1,109 tons, on
which £7,039 was paid for railway carriage. In 1888 there
were 9,357 bales of wool, weighing 1,592 tons, and on which
£7,037 was paid for railway carriage, received at the Jericho
railway station from Blackall and runs in the district. In 1889
this traffic increased to 12,584 bales, weighing 2,161 tons, on
which the sum of £9,574 was paid. In 1888 the number of
sheep forwarded from this district amounted to 3,148, on which
£241 was paid to the Railway Department ; in 1889 this traffic
increased to 34,426, realising £1,486. In addition to the above
there has been a large amount of traffic between Barcaldine and
Blackall and district, particulars of which are not available.
“ In addition to this, the annual surplus of the stock above
enumerated, which is now mainly driven south, would furnish a
very important source of traffic for the proposed branch, Blackall
being the centre of one of the richest pastoral districts of the
Colony.
“ The avowed aim of land legislation of late years has been
to induce close settlement, and another extract from the petition
above quoted will show the progress of selection in this district.
“The area of land selected and occupied in the immediate
vicinity of Blackall, under the Act of 1876, amounts to 34,587
acres, which are improved far in excess of the requirements of


the Act; and the area of land selected near the town of Blackall,
under the Crown Lands Act of 188! to 1889 , amounts as follows: —
Agricultural farms, 13,098 acres; grazing farms, 155,976 acres
(in addition to this, 60,000 acres were taken up during the last
week in July, 1890). There are now over 11,000 acres open to
selection as agricultural farms, and 231,097 acres as grazing
farms, besides which many thousands of acres, which have not
yet been surveyed into selections, are included in the resumed
areas of the various runs.
“When, despite the present high rates of carriage on supplies,
and the heavy cost of improvements and of sending produce to
market, selection has made such strides, it is easy to see that,
with the cheap means of transit a railway would provide, a large
influx of men and money would certainly follow, thus consider-
ably increasing the output of the district.
“Such in brief is the case to be submitted to the Minister
for Railways; and when it is further considered that the country over
which the proposed line would pass is almost level, offering little
or no engineering difficulties, the plea for railway communication
to Blackall is undoubtedly a strong one.
“The petition will be presented to the Minister within a
few weeks, and I will inform you as to the result as early as
possible.”
“ I am,
“ Yours faithfully,
CHARLES CARKEEK
Hon. Secretary Blackall Railway League."
GRAZING FARMS IN THE BARCOO.
“TO THE EDITOR OF ‘THE QUEENSLANDER.’
“ Sir, —‘ Rome was not built in a day.’ The same may be
said of the homes of the Barcoo selectors. No doubt some of
your readers do not even know where the Barcoo is, much
less that the Barcoo is a splendid grazing country where there
are thousands of acres of beautiful land which in fair seasons
will carry a sheep to the acre, and can be had at a rental of Id.
to l£d. per acre per annum. I am quite sure that there are
thousands of people in New South Wales, Victoria, and New
Zealand—people that are already colonised—who would be glad
of the chance of being able to invest a small capital to such
great advantage and get such good returns for their outlay as
can tie got out of a selection of 20,000 acres on the Barcoo,


which I call the Darling Downs of the West. Almost all
have heard ot the wonderful nature of the Darling Downs as a
grain, stock, and wool producing spot in Queensland, but in time
it will be only as the dot to the i as compared with the Barcoo. The
early age that stock come to maturity is wonderful. I saw
a steer killed at the age of sixteen months winch when dressed
brought the scales down at 5161 b. The above animal had been
shut up every night for twelve months, being a milker’s first
calf. From what I can learn from the people on and near the
coast, they imagine that the Barcoo is out of the w r orld ; that it
is hot, that everyone has fever and Barcoo vomit, and that the
flies are unbearable ; instead of which it is a fine bracing climate,
much the same as the Darling Downs, and flies no w T orse ; and
instead of the Barcoo being out of the w r orld, a load of w'ool can
be taken off the sheep’s back and placed on board ship at from
£8 to £ll per ton, and in about a fortnight. Now, Mr. Editor,
I would ask you what the people are thinking of in letting this
beautiful land almost lie idle; for land that is fenced in by
the mile can never be used to advantage. As a rule there is
only one or two vaterlioles in a 40,000-acre paddock, so
that more than half the grass is trodden out; in fact, most of
the country is going to waste, owing to its being w r orked in too
large areas. But, even so, although most of it is held by com-
panies who have paid as much as £250 per mile for the goodwill
only, they can make in a fair season 20 per cent. But w r ith
the goodwill cost deducted from the purchasing price the returns
would be 40 per cent. My statements are made from the selling
price of Malvern Hills and Terrick, which w r as about £1 per
head for the sheep, they both carrying at the time about 200,000
sheep each. derrick now has about 250,000 and Malvern
about 200,000. They are good sheep, and the wool commands a
gocd price, but strange to say the owners try to keep their
own counsel, saying, “ If we make our welfare too public we will
get too much settlement.” On which grounds some of the
stations declined to show their sheep at the Blackall Pastoral
Society’s show. Now let any one calculate the returns from a
5,000 to a 20,000 acre block, when they will find that the
capital required by a practical man w r ould be as follows : —5,000
acres, £1,000; 10,000 acres, £1,800; 15,000 acres, £2,400;
20,000 acres, £3,000. The returns would be in three years from
the 5,000-acre block, £800; the 10,000 acres, £1,400; 15,000
acres, £2,000; and from the 20,000-acre block, £2,500 ; or in
other words about 80 per cent, without goodwill; and with good-
will, as sold formerly, from 40 to 60 per cent. —I am, sir, &c.,
E. T. T.


“TO THE EDITOR OF ‘THE INDEPENDENT.’
“ Sir, —I am glad you have enlarged your paper —an improve-
ment in the right direction. Now, I have no doubt that you will
study the lasting welfare of the district at large. In my opinion
you should always keep before the public the amount of land
there is open for selection, the class as to water, and area of each
lot; as what is wanted in this district is more settlement, and
more of its own products kept in the district. At present a
station of two hundred thousand sheep keeps a manager at £2OO
or £3OO a year, about two overseers at from £BO to £lOO, and
about ten boundary riders ; say, the year’s wages sheet at £2,000 ;
this representing the whole of the money spent in the district,
with the exception of shearing, for the whole year, while the
income from the land amounts to about £30,000 —£25,000 of
which goes out of the district. Now, Mr. Editor, it is not that
grazing on a small scale won’t pay, but the principal reason is
that people do not know that there is such land to be had for a
rental of from Id. to an acre per annum. Land that will
carry a sheep to the acre in ordinary seasons, and turn in a first-
class percentage on the outlay with no more risk than with money
expended in any other business (I think not so much), and a
higher percentage than gold mining, especially Mount Morgan.
Now that water is found all over the district by artesian bores,
there is far less risk in grazing than formerly. I have no doubt
that union of the working men is a good thing for the district, if
not carried too far ; but union of selectors in small grazing areas,
where every man is his own master, would do more good in one
year (if the country in the Baroo district was properly settled),
than all other unions put together in a lifetime.
“Mr. Editor,perhaps you are not aware of the fact, that years
ago we used to have an annual show, and afterwards a show
dinner, where all that liked could pass their opinion on the wel-
fare of the district. But now the squatters take such little interest
(outside their own boundary fence), in the district that there is
no show, the dinner remains in the pot, and public opinion
remains in abeyance. Report says that one of the owners of a
station in this district said ‘ I will not support the show, as it
will tend to make the district too public, and we do not want to
show the world more than can be helped what the land will
produce.’

PARAGRAPH RELATING TO ARTESIAN BORES.
A week seldom passes without some news being available
regarding boring for artesian water, now underway in so many
localities out west. Just after the letter was closed last week the
news came along the wires that the Divisional Board bore upon
the main road from here to Aramac had become a splendid success.
The site is on Politic Creek, on the road mentioned, ten miles
from Aramac and thirty-five from Barcaldine. The depth at
which water was struck was 600 ft., and the same day it was
flowing over the surface at the estimated quantity of 160,000
gallons per day. The water is of good quality, and the tempera-
ture considered to be less than that of the Barcaldine wells.
The work was under the management of Mr. Brown, and boring
was only commenced on the 24tli May, and some time was lost in
casing the bore, owing to loose stuff falling in as boring proceeded.
The manager states that the formation was nearly the same as
that of other bores in tne vicinity—namely, blue shale with hard
streaks every few feet. On top of the water-bearing rock is about
20ft. of something very like chalk; it is quite white and easily
bored. Water was first tapped at about 525 ft., and from that
depth to 613 ft. it was all water-bearing rock. Boring was
stopped at the latter depth, a very hard formation having been
struck, something like the bottom of the first Barcaldine bore.
The boring was very fair, steam only being on the boiler eleven
days altogether. Northampton Downs has also been fortunate
in securing an artesian supply of water. The plant used there
was the one removed from Barcaldine after the artesian well at
the scouring works was finished. The site on Northampton is
about one mile and a-lialf from the woolslied, and the water was
struck at 1183 ft.; the yield is 40,000 gallons per day. It is
expected that this supply will be increased considerably, and bor-
ing will be continued until at least 200,000 gallons is obtained.
The prospect of getting this is very bright, as the supply of water
increases with every stroke of the drill. This makes a total of
twenty-three flowing 'wells in the Central and W estern districts.
Of this number ten are on Corinda, three at Saltern Creek, tw r o
at Barcaldine township, and one each at Blackall, Tambo, Lans-
downe, Northampton, Back Creek, Home Creek, 21-Mile, and
Aramac road. Wells now being put down are on Evora, Barcal-
dine station, Tara and Leichhardt selections, Albilbali, Tambo
station, and Alpha road. Unsuccessful bores, where work has
been abandoned, are Stev T art’s, over 2000 ft.(Tambo-Alplia road);
Wellshot, 1200 ft. ; and Westland, 2500 ft.

occupation in respect of the Grazing Farm.
Rent to be paid during license.
56. During the currency of the license the selector shall
pay the annual rent at the same time and place as is hereinafter
prescribed in the case of rent reserved by and payable under the
lease, and in the event of his failing to make such payment the
same consequences shall ensue with respect to the license as are
prescribed in the case of a lease upon the like default.
Condition of Improvement.
57. In the case of Grazing Farms the selector must, within
three years from the issue of the license, enclose the land with a
good and substantial fence.
In the case of Agricultural Farms the selector must, within
five years from the issue of the license, either enclose the land
with a good and substantial fence or make substantial and
permanent improvements on the land of a value equal to the
cost of such a fence.


If the same person is the selector of two or more contiguous
lots, it shall be sufficient to enclose the whole area comprised in
the lots, or to make the prescribed improvements upon any part
of such whole area.
It shall not be necessary to erect a fence upon any boundary
which is formed by a natural feature of such a character as to
be sufficient to prevent the passage of stock.
The selector must also within such period of three or five
years respectively apply to the Commissioner for a certificate that
lie has done so. Upon such application being made, the Com-
missioner, or some other person appointed by the Governor-in-
Council in that behalf, shall inspect the selection, and, if he finds
that the whole of the land has been so enclosed or improved, shall
certify that fact to the Board.
The Board may, if the selector has from any unavoidable
cause been prevented from enclosing or improving the land with-
in the time hereinbefore prescribed, grant an extension of twelve
months’ further time to make such enclosure or improvement ;
but if the fencing or improvement is not completed within such
extended time the license to occupy shall become inoperative, and
the selector shall have no further right or title to the land or the
occupation thereof.
Lease to issue.
58. Upon the receipt by the Board of a certificate that the
selection has been fenced or improved as hereinbefore prescribed,
the selector shall be entitled to a lease thereof from Her Majesty,
under and subject to the conditions following and all other the
conditions and provisions of this Act, that is to say :
Provided that notwithstanding each forfeiture the Governor -
in-Council may waive the forfeiture and re-instate the selector
upon payment of the arrears of rent due at the date of each for-
feiture and the accrued penalty.
(1.) The term of the lease shall in the case of an Agricul-
tural Farm be fifty years, and in the case of a Grazing
Farm be thirty years, computed from the first day of
January or first day of July nearest to the date ot the
license ;
(2.) The annual rent reseived under the lease shall for the
first ten years thereof be the rent specified by the pro-
clamation declaring the land open to selection. The
rent for each period of five years after the first ten
years shall be determined by the Board ;


(3.) Tlie rent shall be payable in respect of the year ending
on the thirty-first day of December, and shall be pay-
able at the Treasury in Brisbane, or other place ap-
pointed by the Governor-in-Council, on or before the

(4.) In determining the rent regard shall be had to—
(a.) The quality and fitness of the land for agricultural
or grazing purposes, as the case may be ;
(b.) In the case of Grazing Farms the number of stock
which the holding may reasonably be expected to
carry in average seasons after a proper and reason-
able expenditure of money in improvements ;
(c.) The distance of the holding from railway or water
carriage ;
(cl.) The natural supply of water, and the facilities for the
storage or raising of water ;
(e.) The relative value of the holding at the time of the
assessment as compared with its value at the time
of the commencement of the lease :
Provided that in estimating the value any incre-
ment in value attributable to improvements shall
not be taken into account.
(5.) If default is made by the lessee in the payment of rent
the lease shall be forfeited, but the lessee may defeat
the forfeiture by payment of the full annual rent with-
in ninety days from the date hereinbefore appointed for
payment thereof with the addition of a sum by way of
penalty, calculated as follows, that is to say :—lf the
rent is paid within thirty days, five per centum is to be
added ; if the rent is paid within sixty days, ten per
centum is to be added ; and if the rent is paid after
sixty days, fifteen per centum is to be added ; but unless
the whole of the rent, together with such penalty, is
paid within ninety days from the appointed day, the
lease shall be absolutely forfeited ;
(6.) The leesee shall occupy the land continuously and bond
fide during the term of the lease ;
Such occupation shall be by the continuous and
bond fide residence on the land of the lessee himself,
or some other person who is the actual and bond
fide manager or agent of the lessee for the purpose
of the use and occupation of the land, and who is
himself not disqualified from selecting a farm of the
same area and class in the district ;


Every appointment of a manager or agent by the
lessee shall he in writing signed by the parties or their
agents, and shall be in duplicate; and one copy there-
of shall be registered in the office ol the Commissioner ;
Occupation by a person under an unregistered
appointment shall not be recognised ;
(7.) In the case of a Grazing Farm the lessee shall keep the
land fenced with a good and substantial fence during
the whole term of the lease ;
Provided that if the same person is the lessee of
two or more contiguous Farms in his own right, it
shall be sufficient if the whole area comprised in the
Farms is so fenced ;
(8.) If at any time during the currency of the lease it is
proved to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that
the lessee has failed in regard to the performance of
the condition of occupation or fencing, the Governor-
in-Council, on the recommendation of the Board, may
declare the lease absolutely forfeited and vacated, and
thereupon the land comprised therein shall revert to
Her Majesty ;
(9.) Provided that in the case of a Grazing Farm, if it is
proved to the satisfaction of the Board that the failure
to occupy was caused by unavoidable want of water upon
the farm, the Board may excuse such failure ; but such
excuse shall not be given for a period of more than
twelve months unless the want of water continued for
a longer period;
Rent to be paid pending assessment.
(10.) When the rent of a farm is to be determined by the
Board, the lessee shall, until it has been so determined,
continue to pay at the prescribed time and place the
same amount of annual rent as heretofore, and when
the amount of rent has been determined by the Board,
the lessee shall, on the next thirty-first day ot March,
pay at the prescribed place any arrears of rent found
due by him at the rate so determined, so as to adjust
the balance due to the Crown.

gate area whereof, together with the area of the freehold land or
of the holding under Part 111. of this Act, exceeds the area
allowed to be selected by one person in that district. In the case
of several joint holders of freehold land each shall be deemed to
be the holder of an area equal to the total area divided by the
number of joint holders.
Restrictions not to apply in certain cases.
61. The restrictions hereinbefore imposed against any per-
son holding a Farm, or against any one person holding more
than the prescribed area of land as a Farm or Farms, shall not

same terms as those then applicable thereto, or may be pro-
claimed open for selection or occupation in any manner in which
Crown lands in the district may be selected or occupied.
But the former lessee shall not, in case the lease was deter-
mined by forfeiture, be competent to select the land or any part
thereof, or to become the lessee thereof or of any part thereof
by assignment, for a period of five years from the time of forfei-
ture.

the term, the new lessee shall pay to the former lessee compen-
sation for any improvements upon the land. The amount of
such compensation shall be determined by the Board after hear-
ing both parties, and shall be recoverable by action in any
court of competent jurisdiction. Provided that the new lessee
shall not be entitled to receive his lease until he shall produce
evidence of having duly paid the said amount of compensation,

condition of occupation, and his lease may be dealt with
accordingly.

or one-half the annual rent, whichever is the lesser sum, for
every year during which the selection has been held, shall be
credited to the selector as paid in advance in respect of the rent
reserved by the lease, or if there be any surplus after payment of
such rent, then in respect of the purchase money as hereinafter
provided.


The rent to be reserved under the lease for the first ten
years shall he determined by the Board, but shall not be less than
the minimum hereinbefore prescribed.
The purchase money to be paid on purchasing the selection
within the first twelve years, as hereinafter provided, shall be
the selection price, or a sum equal to one pound per acre, which-
ever is the greater sum.
A selector may, before applying to surrender his title under
the provisions ot this section, require the Board to determine the
rent which will be reserved for the first ten years in the event of
such surrender.
Acquisition of Freehold.
In agricultural areas fee-simple may be acquired after ten years’ persona^

holding of the lessee himself, or of each of two or more suc-
cessive lessees, for the period of ten years next preceding the
application hereinafter mentioned, the lessee may apply to the
Commissioner to become the purchaser of the holding, and upon
proof to the satisfaction of the Commissioner in open court that
such condition has been so performed, and on payment at the
Treasury, or other place appointed by the Governor-in-Council,
of the prescribed price and deed fee, and assurance fee, he shall
be entitled to a Deed of Grand of the land in fee-simple.
When the title to a selection under “ The Croicn Lands
Alienation Act oj 1870” has been surrendered and a new lease
has been issued under the provisions of the last preceding section,
any continuous personal residence of the selector upon the
selection up to the time of such surrender shall be computed in
reckoning the period of ten years.
The purchase money shall, if the application to purchase is
made before the expiration of twelve years from the commence-
ment of the term of the lease, be the price specified by the
Proclamation which declared the land open to selection, or here-
inbefore prescribed, as the case may be; and, if the application
is made at a later time, shall be a sum bearing the same pro-
portion to that price as the rent payable at the time of the
application to purchase bears to the rent specified by that Pro-
clamation or so prescribed.
When a holding is vested in an executor or administrator of
a deceased lessee, the residence on the land of any person who
is beneficially interested in the holding shall be deemed to be
personal residence of the lessee for the purposes of this section.


Fencing.
A good and substantial fence can be put up with wire, viz:—
Posts about 44 inches in diameter at small end; # length, 5 feet 8
inches; distance apart, 12 feet; size of wire, top, No. 8 and five
lower wires No. 10.; posts to be 22 inches in the ground,
strainers 3 feet, to be barked level with the ground. Wood to
be Gidya or Boree. Strainers to be 8 inches in diameter, and
one every 20 posts. The wires should be divided as follows : Ist
wire 7 inches above ground, 2nd wire 12 inches, 3rd 18 inches,
4tli 24 inches, sth 31 inches, 6tli 43 inches. The weight of wire
to a mile will be 3441b5. of No. 8, and 2591b5. of No. 10.
Dam Making.
The lollowing is an easy method of calculating the cubic
contents of a tank :
100 ft.
Prismoral Formation.
80ft.
40ft.
60ft.
Depth 10ft.
Bottom section 80 x 40 = 3,200 square feet.
Top „ 100 x6O = 6,000 ~
Middle ~ 90 x5O = 4,500 ~
Add together Bottom section, Top section, and four times Middle
section, divide same by 6, multiply result by depth, this gives
contents in cubic feet, divide by 27 to get contents in cubic yards.
3200 x 6000 x 4 x 4500 x 10 = 45,333 cubic feet.
