COLOURED MOTTLED
ENAMEL FUEL STOVES
IN GREEN, BLUE OR GREY. *
, THE NEW ATTRACTIVE FINISH.
This new MOTTLED ENAMEL Finish has a pleasing appearance, which always
looks cool and at the same time will tone with any colour scheme. It has a highly
glazed surface that in ordinary domestic use may be termed ever-lasting, and will
not chip or craze.
It is easily kept clean: an occasional rub with a damp cloth is all that is
necessary.
This finish effectively seals the metal from moisture, thus preventing the
formation of rust.

THE “REGINA” STOVE.
For Long Wood or Coal.
See Page 1 for Mottled Enamel Finish.
Note. —The “Regina” Stove can only be supplied in Grey Mottled Enamel. Blue anu
Green not being suitable for this type of Stove.
Please note: Short and Elevated Legs are interchangeable.
This popular Stove is now improved, and we draw attention to the Damper
Rod, which is enclosed in the body to prevent damage in transit. Also the improved
Door Catch, etc.
The body of the Stove is constructed of the best quality wrought sheet steel of
heavy gauge for its strength, and in order to conserve the heat generated, we have
double cased this around the oven, packing the space between the casing with clay
silicate of special mixture, and so obtaining as equal a heat in the oven as can possibly
be obtained in a stove set in brickwork. It is constructed to burn long wood
economically. The cast-iron parts are made extra heavy, and the whole combination,
as will be seen by the above illustration, gives a good appearance as well as a
thoroughly efficient article.
Stove supplied with Lifter, Raker and Flue Brush.
8 ft. of SJ4 in. Flue Pipe is necessary for correct draught.
When ordering Flue Pipe only for this Stove, please state Number of Stove and
whether bottom length is required.

"Kosi"
CONTINUOUS BURNING
HEATING STOVES
No. 2 and No. 3 “Kosi.”
The “Kosi” can be installed in
front of Register Grate, or can be
built into a brick or tile surround.
It is also suitable for rooms without
fireplace.
Although the capacities are the
same, the overall sizes of the No.
3B are slightly greater than the
No. 3. The modern square design
of the No. 3B admirably suits the
present day architecture.
See Page 41 for particulars of
new Majolica Enamel finish.
The “Kosi” fills the demand for an
attractive, economical heating stove for
lounge or dining room of the modern
home.
These Stoves burn ordinary small
coke and are absolutely clean in opera-
tion; no soot, ash or dust can enter
the room from the fire box. The room
is heated evenly by the circulation of
the air over the extensive radiating
surface at back of stove, the frets at
side and top allowing air to circulate.
No. 3B “Kosi.”

SPUN AND RIVETED COPPERS.
Spun Seamless Coppers.
Riveted Coppers.
ONE-PIECE SPUN SEAMLESS COPPERS.
We have installed a complete and up-to-date plant, which, having proved
successful, allows us to offer a ONE-PIECE COPPER at a lower price than our
BRAZED COPPER.
As the demand for these SPUN COPPERS has been far greater than the demand
for BRAZED and LIGHT RIVETED COPPERS, we have decided to discontinue
making both the latter.
Spun Coppers are made in three weights
LIGHT, MEDIUM, HEAVY.
The “Light” has been made to meet a demand for a low priced Copper, but we
advise the “Medium” as more serviceable for general use in preference to the “Light.
Spun Coppers are supplied in from 10 to 20 gallon sizes. Medium and Heavy
Riveted Coppers are supplied in from 10 to 50 gallon sizes.
All Coppers should be crated for country. (See Price List.)
Note.—Unless ordered otherwise, all Coppers will be supplied in these sizes.
If required we can make to order Riveted Coppers to any given diameter and depth.

CORRUGATED TANK FLANGES.

The above illustrates the most ser-

pipes to an ordinary corrugated tank,
and can be fitted by any handy man.
With an ordinary socket, which has
been soldered into a tank and requires
an expert to place in position, the area
upon which the strain is carried is very
limited, but with these corrugated
flanges the strain is distributed over a
very large area.

The Burners
These Burners actually convert the kero-
sene fuel into gas. The flame rises in the
combustion chamber—between the two per-
forated tubes. Air is drawn in, mixes as
gas with the kerosene vapour and rises as
a hot blue flame out of the top, striking
and spreading under the cooking utensil.
Metters’ No. 3 Oil Stove is fitted with three
of these burners, and No. 2 Oil Stove with
two, which also have the “Rockweave”
Wick no trouble, no cutting, non-burning,
long lasting.

“ MAJESTIC ” (Underground) GARBAGE RECEIVER.
Cast-iron Top. 18 inches Diameter.
Outside Shell, Black Iron, 20 inches deep.
Inside Receiver, Galvanised Iron, 18 inches deep.
Crating, 2/6 each.
The “ Majestic ” (Underground) Garbage Receiver is ideal for domestic use. It
consists of a heavy water-proof cast-iron cover, with foot operated hinged lid,_ heavy
sheet iron outer casing or shell, with a removable galvanised iron container with bail
handle.
It is neat and sanitary. Compare the top left-hand illustration, for that is all
that is exposed of the “Majestic” Garbage Receiver, with the usual unsightly, and
very unhygienic garbage tin, that every prying cat or hungry dog can upset and
strew the contents about, a veritable breeding ground for bacteria, and feeding ground
for flies, etc.
The “Majestic” (Underground) Garbage Receiver can be installed by simply
digging a hole to accommodate the outer casing in any convenient position, at the
kitchen door (as it is water and odor-proof), or convenient to the entrance for handy
access to the garbage collector.
