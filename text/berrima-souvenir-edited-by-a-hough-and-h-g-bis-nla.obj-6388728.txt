© THE EDITORS
WISH to thank Lieut.-Coi. Darvall for
his permission in allowing them
to publish this little Souvenir; also for
his kindness in granting them special
facilities for carrying out their work oh it.
They wish specially to thank Corpl.
J. F. Scott for his invaluable help in
looking after the illustrations ; thanks
are also due to Mr. Diment for photo-
graphic work.
They regret the necessity of leaving
out so many good contributions, but
the limited time which they could allow
the printers compelled them to confine
the souvenir to its present size.
They are greatly pleased at the en-
thusiastic manner in which the sugges-
tion of producing this souvenir has been
taken up, and trust that it will be valued
by each and every one aboard the
"Berrima" in years to come as a me-
© mento of a voyage taken at a critical ©
and unprecedented period in the history
of the British Empire.

"BERRIMA" SOUVENIR
JANUARY IST, 1917.
THINGS WE WANT TO KNOW IN 6/43.
What is the real name of the concoction
which is served up to us as tea and coffee?
* *
If the electrician is a member of tlie
I.W.W. ?
* * *
Why there should be any objection to a
man being allowed to rest in comfort for
.a few minutes in one place.
# * *
If the nurses have their hands full.
If 8.30 is not far too late to retire. Why
not immediately after tea?
If Crabbe has bought a razor yet?
# *
Who is the Nap king?
How many men have slhpt in their own
hammocks every night.
* *
What is the real reason why the Canteen
so frequently runs out of every kind of
drink but Canteen ale.
If Mr. Opie is a real Yank, or only talks
like one.
Who were the two sergeants who had
two tries in the bridge tournament—one
for bad luck. Easy seen it's their second
voyage.
Why "cockies' 1 and "townies" commence
arguing about the importance of their re-
spective occupations at daybreak every
morning, and if either of these occupations
are half as important as they seem to
think they are.
If there would not be general satisfac-
tion if the punch-ball were to be bursted
or stolen.
If the gentlemen who so heatedly argue
about politics know anything about poli-
tics at all.
If it is because we have a "Furness"
that we are known to be hot stuff on B
deck.
If any qualms of conscience are felt by
anybody at the loss of the box containing
comforts for the 6/43 rd.
* *
If it is true that Taylor is a glutton for
v ork.
Why the tarpaulins are not thought of
until we are wet through during the night.
If Hoskin has a language all his own
If P. X. Collins is not too genteel to
make a successful "copper."
If Hcnnessy prefers soldiering to his
work on the railway, and why?
If Jack Hall ever read the old proverb
"Silence is Golden."
B-E-R-R-I-iVI-A.
B Stands for Berrima, the name of the
ship
That is taking us all for a bonzer
trip.
E Stands for England, the home of the
free,
Where we all hope very shortly to be.
R Stands for ready, which we are
todayy
And eager, too, to join in the fray.
RAlso stands for ruin and run—-
The certain face of the Turk and the
Hun.
T Stands for instinct by which we knovv
* That we shall be in at the Kaiser's
death-blow.
M Stands for Motherland; long may
her name
Continue to lead on the roll of fame.
A Stands for Australia, the land of our
birth,
For which we will fight for all we
are worth.
—Corpl. Arthur Hough.
THE VOYAGE.
Fine weather has been experienced
throughout the journey since we left Aus-
tralia, thus enabling good progress to be
made to our destination. The distances
covered daily from Jan. Ist to 7th are as
follows:—lst, 306 miles; 2nd, 315; 3rd, 282;
4th, 311; sth, 302; 6, 288; 7th, 175 (half-
day, arrival at Durban).
Leave was granted to the men at Ire-
mantle, and was much appreciated. An
enjoyable day was spent in seeing the
sights of Perth and Fremantle, to which
most of the men were strangers.
The favourite bugle calls on board:
Reveille and four G's.
COURAGE.
Courage, deart heart, though sad is now
the parting;
Think of the hour when vict'ry crowns
your arms;
Joy bells will ring to welcome your
returning,
Peace will be ours, and gone war's dread
alarms.
Courage, dear heart; in thought we'll be
together,
Just as of old, dear, whatever may
betide;
Love grows but deeper—memories still
fonder,
Reaching afar o'er land and ocean wide.
—D.S.
Excited Subaltern: "The enemy are
sv arming over their parapets, Sir, as thick
as peas! What are we going to do about
it?" Major (calmly): "Shell 'em, boy—
shell em."
There is no excuse for 6th of 43rd not
keeping their rifle barrels clean. They
always have their pull thro' with them.

A REMARKABLE EPISTLE.
The following is a faithful copy of an
order sent to* and executed by Messrs.
Charlick Brothers, grocers, of 270, Bundle
Street, Adelaide. It came from Tailem
Bend a few months ago, and suggests that
rural education needs a little improvement:

12/32 QUIPS.
It is said that:
Unit concerts were not thought of until
12/32 set the ball rolling.
Our burly Sergeant has undergone a
course of weight reduction, and is now in
fine fettle. This course was of a strenuous

OUR MASCOT (6/43).
Who is it rousts at all the boys.
When lie himself makes all the noise?
Who missed the boat and lest his kit,
And talked himself into a fit?
Who was it got put in the clink,
And said he hadn't had a drink?
Who is it always giving buck,
And saying, "I don't have no luck"?
Who's never late going on parade,
And says of nothing he's afraid?
Who is it thinks lie ought to be
The right-hand man of our O.C. ?
? ?
Who is it always makes us laugh,
And has to stand all sorts of chaff?
A hurly-burly sort of chap,
Who's playing all day long at Nap,
Who would, if he could have his say,
Bun things in a different way?
—A.H.
18 27th NOTES,
The forthcoming football match to be
held at Durban is causing much heart-
burning among the lads. Writer has had
many aspirants approaen him acclaiming
their high standard of efficiency. One 47-
year-old colt, named Ross, imagined that
because lie carried the chewing-gum fo*'
Essendon 21 years ago that lie should stand
a fair chance of inclusion among present-
day talent. No, no, Rossi! Stick to
Euchre; no hard knocks in the niggers'
game.
A mess orderly of F Deck, known to his
confreres as "Plugger Bill" Martin, shortly
after embarkation was heard to loudly
boast of being an old sea-dog; neither the
lashing waves nor the biting winds did he
fear. But, alas! 20 minutes after con-
suming a huge feed of mashed spuds,
pickled pork, and haricot beans he was
found lying on deck a martyr to mal-de-
mer. A comrade standing by exclaimed:
"Hello! There's the anchor coming up!"
Plugger muttered:- "Strewtli! I thought
everything was up long ago!"
Another mess orderly, to wit "Fat"
Garden, is the bugbear of Orderly Corporal
Boalch. Fat daily complains to the long
'un that the tucker is inrafficient to feed
his ravenous, mess. This can be easily
understood, for Fat has only put on 4st.
on the voyage: in fact, he has wasted
away to about the size of an ordinary cart-
horse.
Don Curtis, alias "Lardy" Lowe, marine
dealer, is reported to have lost his licence
through handing into canteen two kero-
sene bottles and one tomato sauce bottle.
Things have been moving lately on the
aft troop decks, promotions being many
ana reductions not a few. Amongst the
decorated privates is one " Possum " Ward
(sometimes known as "Dinkum"), one-time
champion boxer of his own home. ■' 'Pos-
sum's" chest is reported to have swelled
visibly since the attachment of the one
bar.
Popular and all as Sergt. Johnson, of
18/27, is with his mess-mates, lie will have
to stop his chin music, otherwise there is
likely to be trouble at No. 3 table.
"Johnny" will persist in boasting of his
boxing and musical capabilities. Says he
would not mind showing Buggins a few
points in the noble art, or try his hand
at the piano against Corpl. Bastian for a
small sum.
Charlie Buggins, always popular with
the boys of the 18-27, was & particularly
great hero after winning the welter-weight
boxing tourney on New Years morning.
Willis, his opponent, is an did and ex-
perienced boxer, and there were many on
beard who thought he would win: but he
was unable to withstand CdiaflieV cyclonic
attacks. A heavy punch on the point put
the ex-Queenslander down to the board's
for eight. On assuming the perpendicular
he was severely punished about the body.
Unfortunately, at this stage he injured
his arm, and cried enough. A big crowd
witnessed the contest, and, although the
bout was over in a couple of minutes, they
were satisfied they had witnessed two
genuine sports indulge in the manly pas-
time.
Rumour hath it amongst the lads of
18-27 that Sergeants Ashworth and Edwards
have been trying to put up some of their
ancient and thread-worn jokes at the Ser-
geants' Mess, but so far they have fallen
very flat. Ao one seems to bite "Teddy's"
story with a moral about shopkeeper
"Twineham," nor will any of the three-
stripers have anything to do with "Ashy's"
yarn about "Sitting Bull," though assisted
by Friend Dineen. Call them cherry-nose,
'"Ash." That'll make 'em bite.
At piesent the three predominant
thoughts in C'apt. Chaplain Arnold's mind
concern gaiters, gloves, and silk stocking 4 3.
Truth has it that, whilst sleeping on the
boat deck lie was blissfully awakened by
a kiss from one of the Sisters. What will
her harvest be?
AN APPRECIATION
No publication such as ours could be
complete which failed in its pages to ex-
pi ess the appreciation which we have for
the men in blue, and in particular are our
feelings kindly towards those to whose
care we are committed in our present
voyage.
For ourselves, the new life, involving
though it does sacrifice of greater or lesser
extent, yet brings with it many compensa-
tions in the break-away from our estab-
lished routine, with its new appeals to our
senses. To them little of this —rather the
dangers of modern naval warfare added to
the usual perils of their calling, and for the
social pleasures of passenger service the
discomforts of crowded troonships, and re-
sultant arduous labours. Through it all
they carry on their work with the same
steadfast patience and good-humour which
characterise them in times of peace.
Let us therefore here assure them of our
sincere appreciation of their efforts in the
common cause, expressing the hope that as
the men of the past and present, so may
in future be the officers and men of the
Merchant Service.
—E.M.G.
THE DRY CANTEEN
Though it's only very small,
It keeps the wants of all —
That's the Dry Canteen.
"What you want it has got,
And sometimes it has not—
That's the Dry Canteen.
But you'll always hear a roar
When the policeman on the door
Says, "Closed up; they'll serve no more
At the Canteen."
There are fags in galore,
And many things more,
At the Dry Canteen.
There is no need to think—
Why, strike me pink!
Call at the Canteen.
You join in the line,
And you'll reckon it. fine
When it comes to your time (to be served)
At the Dry Canteen.
Ti you want a biscuit.
And vou'd care to risk it,
Call at the Dry Canteen;
And if you'd like some ale,
Which you'll find a little pale,
Call at the Dry Canteen.
There is never harm in calling,
But there's always a chance of falling
When you hear the keeper bawling ("Sold,
out!")
At the Dry Canteen.

8/48 NOTES.
Rumour has it that one of us should
have gone into hospital, instead of coming
to sea. But he could only be persujaded
to have his many wounds dressed when
well out of sight of land. It was a man
in a motor car who bruised him; skinned
half his face and put several ribs out of
joint. That chauffeur has missed his voca-
tion, sure. He must have a wonderfully
straight and powerful left'. Probably
doesn't know his own strength either, judg-
ing by the way he knocked an old man
about. Same old man is ambitious, in
spite of his age, for it was his ardour in
love that brought him into conflict with
the motor man, on that last evening ashore.
Reigho! There have been some tragedies,
as well as many romances, enacted in the
same old King's Park, birthplace and
death-bed alike of many loves!
An Australian officer should always be a
tall man. The greatest general in history
was a little man, it is true; but then he
used to go to work on horseback, and was
therefore easily seen. At the pay parade
the other day one of our humorists (we
have several!) stepped up briskly to the
paying counter, signed the sheet, took up
his pay, and turned away again. A ser-
geant present (also a small man) inquired:
"What do> you do when you speak to an
officer?"
Humorist (also a small man), saluting
hastily: "Beg your pardon, Sir —I didn't
see you!"
Rumoured, but not confirmed, that our
O.C. once attended a church parade.
Our corporal—that is, OUR Corporal (the
unstriped one)—continues to delight and
mystify the ship's company with card tricks
and clairvoyance. What does the bottle
say, Corp?
Our baby corporal lias not yet emerged
from the state of torpor that all but ob-
literated him the day we embarked. He
should never have been permitted to go
abroad without his nurse.
"Mother Wim" seems to have reformed
on board; at least, he has discontinued his
former beer-sparring, riot-raising behaviour,
which was, perhaps, an indication of local-
ity rather than character. It is quite pos-
sible that this changed outlook on life is
due to association with his fellow-mess
o:- derlv.
In one mess, at almost every meal, some-
one asks: "When do they feed the sea-
lions?" And the sea-lion himself has not
yet seen the joke!
The Sanitary Fatigue has acquired a
new Dance. This is a "fat-reducing"
stunt!
Judging by the exhibition of cock-crow-
ing at a recent concert, the ventriloquist
of the unit knows more about farming
new than he'll ever know 7 about soldiering.


The last day we supplied the submarine
guard the officer of the guard approached
one of the men and asked him: —
"What would you do if a submarine
appeared?"
"Please, Sir, I would say, 'Halt, Sub-
marine !'"
Collapse of officer.
Not every unit can boast so much latent
talent as we possess. The boxing tourney
revealed the identities of several coining
pugilistic stars. In one conspicuous case
the bruiser himself discovered his hidden
ability for the first time. At least, he's
not the broken Reed he thought he was !

The general opinion of 23/10 is that their
O.C.'s condition is suggestive of .close
friendship with the pantryman.
AN 8/sth OUTING.
Saturday last, being our usual week-end
leave, an invitation from the Browm family
for a river excursion was eagerly accepted
by the Unit. The day broke very Black
indeed, but as the boat chartered was an
Old favourite, and her Bunker being well
filled, it was decided to make a trip to
Wisbey Island. The Crew were a well-
picked lot, the Purser being of Welch
descent. The sun w r as just Rhys-ing as
we Row r e-d out to the launch, where the
Bishop was in waiting to wish us God-
speed. He never looked Bonn,(i)er in his
Brand new stripes. A remark that he was
related to General Booth was all Bunce,
as he denied any connection with that
Bogu(e)s individual. His word was taken
as his Bond. Baccus signalled a message,
excusing himself on account of a Boyle on
his arm, which broke through chasing a
Brindal Hare, an.l he had decided to Bog-
gon till he Boyle (y)d it up. On arrival
at the island C'onniff fell foul of the Cox-
swain by accusing him of giving them
Currie for breakfast when they had Cole-
man's mustard on the table. Duffield
taunted Dilley on the number of Coates he
possessed, but, there being a new Dyer in
town, the argument ceased. To fill in the
time before lunch an offer tc box four
rounds by Kenny was accepted by Atkin,
who thuglxt he had but Hopson's choice.
No damage was Dunn to either. During
the spar a Gunn went off, as a result of
Gramophone Smith giving a party of three
the order to form fours. Grant ed that
he made a mistake, he excused himself by
stating that the trigger was Lewis, the gun
being a Martiri-i. This was a Newson-ce,
but on, reaching the Mill-more trouble was
caused by Pyke passing a bad Penny on to
Peady. Richards came to the lescue by
extolling the virtues of the Pope and St.
Sylvester. A Seabed letter was found in
the possession of Sturrock, but as it was
for one Sheppard, who was a Seller of
Gough's Grist, no action wa,s taken. Joe
Rogers challenged his team, which won tlie
tng-o'-war so easily (?), against the rest
of the Unit combined. This was adding
insult to injury, To Ryan declaring that
if Maitland was ieft out of the champion (?)
team he would leave Mclnnes out of his
team. The laughter which this brought
forth disturbed Farmer Morley's labours.
It was decided to have a "bob in," but the
only drink obtainable was Adams ale, al-
though Scotty McKay got wind of someone
having a bottle of Dawson's- or Walker's
whisky. This was found to be incorrect,
Scrgt. Hammond declaring that he had just
smelt the breath of every man, and the
only doubtful case was Lockwcod. The
crowing of a Cock was the signal for a
dinner, but- an Archer coming along made
short work of him. After the toast of
The King had been honoured, Davies-Moore
sang "Allen Water," with "I dreamt I
dwelt in Marble Hall" as an encore. The
only other contribution to the programme
was "Casey's Secret,"-an exceedingly very
pathetic ballad, written by Morgan, the
mnsic being set by Cullerton. This was
well sung by Williams and Ashby. The
cnly watch on board was a Walthanx, but
as this was so unreliable it was decided
to get back to the launch. This was
accepted as a. Jolley good idea. A euchre
tournament was indulged in on the return
journey, which resulted in Tommason and
Ingram scoring a Wynne over Davis and
Daunt. Home was reached just on time
to hear "Mess-Orderlies" sounded. Mr.
McGowan acted as master of ceremonies,
and reported a clean sheet for the day's
outing.

A FEW GIGGLES.
Tommy No. 1: "That's a German iden-
tity disc you have round your neck. Where
did you get it?"
Tommy No. 2: "One of those blanky
'Uns tried to take me prisoner, and I
in'erited it from 'im."

"I took my final leave in a small country
town," said Private Jones. "Everybody
turned up at the railway station to wish
me safe return, and, naturally, on such
an occasion, everybody lost their heads,
including myself —so much so, that at the
last moment, when the train was steam-
ing out of the station, I kissed the porter
and gave my mother sixpence."
Ike: "My word, Abe, you have a fine
voice!"
Abe: "Do you think so, Ike?"
Ike*. "Sure; why, you ought to be with
Carl Rosa, the famous tenor."
Abe: "Why, he is dead!"
Ike: "That's why I say you ought to be
with him."
Ike: "Say, Abe, have you been vac-
cinated?"
Abe: "No, Ike."
Ike "Why not?"
Abe: "Well, my old man is a Unionist,
and he won't let me."
Ike: "But what has Unionism to do with
vaccination?"
Abe: "Well, Dad says he won't have any
scabs in the family."
'THE PLEA."
Lord, when the evening closes, and I stand
With eager fearful hands tow T ard heaven's
far shore,
Bring me no gift of roses, as the sand
Runs out, to run again for me no more.
But give me one clear hour at close of day,
And whisper as the darkening shadows
fall
The names of friends I lost along the w r ay,
The faithful friends I can no more recall.
And while their names upon my lips are set,
Oh, speed the silent tides that I must stem,
That, ere again I slumber or forget,
I may begin my eager quest of them.

THE CALL.
Oh, Britain! blessed by those sons
Who guard your shores and man your guns,
Whenever you call, wherever they be,
Ready ever to answer thee,
From every corner of the earth,
Back to the land which gave them birth,
Willing and eager for the fight—
Knowing that thy cause is "Right."
They do not ask what it is for
When Britain's sons go out to war;:
It is no time to question when
The Motherland has called for men.
That latent spirit of the past
Rises within them like a blast,
And calls them Home —a noble band—
To fight or fall for dear Homeland.
—Corpl. Arthur Hough.
FIGHTING YET.
(At the Gallipoli landing the London
Press referred to the Australians as
"wounded and out one day, and fighting
the next.')
Shot and healed, and shot again,
Maimed and bruised, and sore beset,
Yonder where the bullets rain—
Fighting yet.
Spliced and bandaged, off they go,
Eager to erase a debt,
Keen again to meet the foe-
Fighting yet.
Britain shall not strive in vain,
When such sons her lands beget—-
Down and out, and back again—
Fighting yet.
On the fields the dead men lie,
Fields where death and glory met,
But the spirit will not die—
Fighting yet.
Adding lustre to a name
That the world shall not forget,
Thus Australia plays the game,
Fighting yet!
—A. W. Rock, New York.

To show those teeth as fair and —false as she

AMUSEMENTS UP TO DATE.
There are two- main essentials to happi-
ness on a troopship—fine weather and
plenty of amusement. These two factors
have, fortunately, been in evidence on the
present trip. The Clerk of the Weather
lias been exceptionally kind, blue skies and
smooth seas prevailing during the whole
of the trip so far. The second desidera-
tum has been plentifully supplied, all tastes
having been very adequately catered for
by the Recreation Committee, under the
presidency of Chaplain Captain Arnold.
Concert programmes of varying degrees
of merit have been presented, on an ave-
rage, three nights a week, and much latent
talent has been discovered —some, we
trust, to be immediately buried. An orches-
tra now discourses sweet strains at most
of the concerts, and has made its initial
appearance at Officers? Mess, when its
leader (Corporal Bastian) was congratu-
lated by the C.O. on the excellence of its
performance.
The outdoor amusements have also been
well looked after, £4O in orders on the Can-
teen being provided by the C'.O., as prizes,
in addition to many valuable articles o?
use which have been placed at the disposal
of the Committee by Mr. Green, A.C.F.,
and Mr. N. Wynne Opie, Y.M.C.A., an ex-
cellent and well-contested boxing tourna-
ment and a hotly-contested series of tugs-
of-war forming the two outstanding fea-
tures in this section. Of the feather-
weights, O'Connor, 12/32, proved the win-
ner, from Gumas, of the same unit, who
put up a game fight.
Among the light-weights, Westley, 12/32,
fought into> first place—a well-deserved
win—from Hammon, 8/5.
In the welter-weight contest Buggins,
18/27, won from Willis, 23/11, who had the
misfortune in the first 30see. to badly
wrench the muscles of one arm, and was
thus forced to discontinue. This unfortu-
nate occurrence was as disappointing to
the onlookers as to Willis himself, a very
good fight having been anticipated be-
tween these two. However, during the
latter half of the voyage further oppor-
tunity will be given to determine the
merits of these two sturdy fighters.
In the middle-weight division Corpl. Bon-
nett, 23/10, scored an easy victory, it being
a pity that no boxer of nearer his own
standard was matched with him, his fights
being simply walk overs.
All the contests were refereed by Bill
Bell, to the satisfaction of contestants and
onlookers alike.
Tlie tug-of-war resulted in a Wcstralian
win, 8/51, winning from 8/50, after a series
of strenuous pulls.
The skipping contest attracted a fair
number of entrants, and was won by Corpl.
Bennett (23/16), 462, from Buggins (18/27),
400.
The various tourneys in connection with
the indoor games are creating a large
amount of interest. Only one, however,
has been completed—i.e., progressive euchre
for the championships of the different
troop decks. The results are as follows:
Troop Deck A: Crottie 1, Gupton 2.
Troop Deck B: Late 1, Tinfield 2.
Troop Deck C: C. Mackenzie 1, J. Read 2.
Troop Deck D: J. E. Rogers 1. H.
Weedon 2.
Troop Deck E: Corpl. Mofflin 1, Edge 2.
Troop Deck F: A. R. Smith 1, F. Owen 2.
Other competitions in this section still in
progress are bridge, whist, cribbage,
draughts, chess, and dominoes, in all of
which games there is keen competition.
The Recreation Committee have also ar-
ranged a varied programme of shore sports,
in the event of luck holding and a landing
being made at Durban. Three inter-State
football matches—Australian game, Soccer,
and Rugby—will provide amusement for
the devotees of these games. Inter-State
cricket and tennis will also take place. In
addition, a good programme of pedestrian
and swimming events has been arranged.
After leaving Durban tli e latter half ol
the programme of amusements in all sec-
tions will be continued, and no effort of
the Committee will be spared to brighten
the lot of the men, on the troop decks.
Amongst th e projected extensions of the
work of the Committee is the formation
of a choral society. Necessary music will
be purchased at Durban for choral and
orchestral work. Under the more difficult
conditions that will prevail after leaving
Durban, the Committee are confident of
the co-operation of the men in making as
pleasant as possible the lot of all on board.
SUGGESTED LECTURES

Sir, —I understand that the 1 O.C. has
inaugurated a series of lectures by the
officers on board, the choice of subject be-
ing left to the discretion of the lecturer.
May I suggest through the pages of your
esteemed journal that in view of their
peculiarly intimate knowledge of the sub-
jects stated below the following gentle-
men be asked to direct their remarks to
these matters, as to which they are en-
titled to speak with that confidence wdiich
is the child of knowledge and experience:

war."
Lieut. Devonshire.—"Watches and de-
tails."

Trusting that you will give this letter
publication in the interests of our com-
munity , —Your s faithfully,
PRO BONO PUBLICO.

Tliev say—
That a certain RETURNED G.S.M. is-
rather a good authority on geography ip>
to date.
That, according to him, the Anzaes
should be quite used to village; fighting.
That this is evident by the story the
said C'.S.M. tells of Australians dying mys-
teriously after having torn the. veils from
some of the fair damsels at the village of
Gallipoli!
That harmony does not always follow in
tlie wake of a piano.
That the sentry post near the Isolation
Hospital is rather eagerly sought after by
the old hands on boat guard.
That it is a post where bad eyesight is
essential.
That a sergeant, who is lean and tanned,
sufficiently to be mistaken for a ' uinkuin
Australian," causes mild surprise among
strangers.
That by his remarks he only came to
the Land of Sunshine to explain to the
savage inhabitants the greatness of " 'Ome."
That apparently England is J, a small por-
tion of the world built round Manchester.
That the old fallacy that dark people
are immune from sea-sickness lias been ex-
ploded.
That one of the Sisters wishes it were
true.
That after a visit to the engine-room
the said Sister has decided in favour of
reformation.
That four "G's" is sufficient to produce
much smashing of Section 40 of the Army
Act.
That, contrary to expectations, this war
is nearly ended.
That the 23/11 are bringing "Piesse" with
them.
That, not content with ending the row,
the same Unit has "Summers ' among its
personnel.
That the cinema rights for this ship
should be invaluable.
That "Physical Jerks' on a rough day
beats any Keystone screamer.
That to instil self-control laughing is-
strictly forbidden at these entertainments.
We have all heard the old saying that/
you can tell an old soldier by the way he
dodges work. We wish to emphatically
contradict this. As one of our sergeants
had 10 or 15 years' Imperial service, he is
surely entitled to be termed an old soldier.
He lias taken over the work of getting
out the Unit's embarkation papers, ami
expects to have them completed by the
time this voyage lias ended. And he only
commenced them six weeks prior, to em-
barkation !
We don't want an escort! We aren't
afraid of submarines! One glimpse of
Kennedy's face under his scarlet cap would
convince any U boat commander we were
as big a crew of pirates as his command.
And we believe in "Honour among Pirates,"
the same as "Honour among thieves.

23/16 th QUIPS.
Sergeant Scotty Marshall has offered to
hack Corporal McDowall against any other
man on the ship for taking a snack at the
mess table; and, true to his clan, Scotty is
no gambler. I think his speculative pro-
pensity was roused one stormy morning
when the gaunt corporal was seen rubbing
his anatomy and gloating over the pros-
tration of half his mess-mates, on which
the same corporal took two and three-
quarter hours to complete his breakfast,
and that of whomsoever was within reach.
Corporal Tillotson is said to have de-
veloped a most amicable disposition on
hoard, owing to the proximity of deep
water and the scarcity on deck of life-
buoys.
Lance-Corporal Hall has entertained
society professionally for three jeans. At
least, we will not dispute his word; but
since lie was discovered on the saloon
deck one day trying to convince an intel-
ligent audience that the aim cf an accom-
panist is not to accompany, but to set the
time for, a singer, we are constrained to
speculate as to whether he entertained
South Sea Islanders or any other tribe
noted for their docility in mechanically
following things.
Lance-Corporal Fisher has conceived the
ingenious idea of increasing his avoirdu-
pois in a boiling-down process, by deposit-
ing his bony proportions in a hot salt bath
every morning for the beet part of an
hour, to the annoyance of a multitude of
would-be ablutionists, who occupy their
waiting moments by poking derision ao
that emaciated sea mammal in submersion.
The kid-glove boundary rider of the 23/16
is now exercising his talent over the
narrow space of the deck, in pursuit of
stray sanitary excrescences in his capacity
as sanitary expert.
ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
4 'Old Reader."—No. "Our" Billy
Hughes is not the Prime Minister, also
he is not taking the principal part in
"Puss in Boots." We can understand
why you thought so, however.

gious body, so you lose your bet.
"Rosebud."—The best way to distin-
guish between weeds and flowering plants
in the early stages is to pull up every-
thing in the garden. Those that come up
again are weeds.
Lieut. Murray.—Yes, Mr. Stubbs was
the hon. member for Subiaco.

THINGS WE WANT TO KNOW, 12/32.
How much do the Canteen people pay the
ship's officers per week to cut off the fresh
water on C. deck ?
If there are any men on board who do
not understand the saying : " Water, water
everywhere and not a drop to drink?"
If it is possible to find a man on board
who wants to say that our food does not
come up to Schedule "A" as posted up in
our quarters.
Why it is that our orderly officer always
comes through C mess before we get our
tucker, and asks us if there are any com-
plaints ?

ship. Reward.—Finder please return to

"THE N.C.O. AS AN ARTICLE OF
OF FOOD.''
To the Editor.
Dear Sir, —In reply to your previous cor-
respondent, the following information is
submitted:
The N.C.O. is generally considered as an
animal rather than a vegetable product.
Indeed it has at times been described by
writers a£ the backbone of something grown
in England. This might very well be, as
it has habits which are most strengthening
and invigorating. The peculiarity of emit-
ting sharp, loud, and unintelligible sounds
when disturbed suggests some relation to
the canine family, though, with the excep-
tion of the hair, the similarity ceases.
In Germany the N.C.O. is highly culti-
vated, though all foreign specimens are there
looked upon as noxious weeds and strenu-
ous efforts are being made to exterminate
the plant.
When young the N.C.O. is a complex
creation. It appears greenish, arid is most
disconcerting in its behaviour. This out-
ward appearance must not be relied upon in
judging the specimen—it is due to the sur-
roundings and method employed in cultiva-
tion, and when more heavily striped and
hoary in appearance the N.C.O. is at its
best. The lighter shaded younger crop is
not recommended as an article of food by
itself. It takes a lot of sauce to make it
palatable, being tough and stringy through
over work. When more matured, the N.C.O.
is usually well nourished and juicy, and this
is the article most largely in demand.
When provisioning boats for extended ser-
vice it is well to see that one heavily striped
N.C.O. is stowed away with the other
biscuits, as this would ensure sustenance
for at least 40 men for a week or more.
The N.C.O. is a nocturnal animal, being
first promulgated under the stars, and re-
quiring constant and continual exposure to
the stars to attain further development.
The cultivation of the N.C.O. has lately
been undertaken in Australia, and much suc-
cess is being gained with the article pro-
duced. Like wine, it takes years to mature,
but present prospects lead us to hope that
Australia can in this, as in other lines, hold
its own with the world. Thanking you in
anticipation,
"WASP."
FAVOURITE SONGS AND THEIR
SINGERS.
"I'd like to be a sailor bold"—Lieut.
Martin.
"Come into the garden, Maud"—Lieut.
Webster.
"Come and have a drink with me"—
Lieut. Coulthard.
Duet, "When we are married," etc.—
Lieut. Silverston and Lieut. Summers.
"Stand-bye(s) for ever"—Lieut. Piesse.
"I waht to be a soldier"—Lieut. Mc-
Gillivray.
"I love the ladies"—Lieut. Murray.
GROWLS FROM THE SERGEANT'S
MESS.
He is a Coy.-Sgt.-Major. Rumour lias
it that he successfully passed Duntroon,
but, being of a fire-eating disposition, he
refused to wait for his commission. He is
of medium height, and inclined to scraggi-
ness; sharp-nosed and eagle-eyed—as to
gambling and smoking between decks.
His chin is of the obstinate, almost mulish
typei, to complete the general aspect of
fierceness he cultivates a bristling mous-
tache. His favourite saying is "That is
not the sort of example a sergeant should
set." His favourite pastime—enforcing
quiet in the mess after Lights Out. He is
NOT the Ship's Sergt.-Major. Three
guesses!
It is simply marvellous how a man of
strong personality can dominate a crowd
of lesser intellects. Brute force is not in
the game with force of character. A
striking illustration of this fact is the,
manner in which one sergeant, though
seized at various times by a hair-hunting
horde, still boasts a fine crop of black
curls.
Speaking of hair-hunters makes us
think of the seriousness of this loss of
hair epidemic. Note the changed appear-
ance of the Sergt.-Major of the 10th Bat-
talions Reinforcements. At Perth it is
rumoured that his mass of fair curls
created havoc in the hearts of the flap-
pers. Since then he has suffered a severe
attack of "loss of hair," and on his pre-
sent appearance we don't anticipate many
broken hearts at Durban.
We have a nuisance, a deadly nuisance
in our midst. Correctly speaking, there
are two of them, but as they are' never
seen apart they only count as one. And,
anyhow, it takes the two of them to make
one normal sized being. While one tor-
tures our ears with what he fondly terms
"singing," his other half makes the intes-
tines of a long defunct cat torment us to
such an extent that we would almost wel-
come a torpedo to afford relief. After
hearing this pair desecrate the silence of
the mess, and remembering that angels
are credited with singing and playing
stringed instruments, 1 am only waiting
for a chance to break my good resolutions
for the New Year.
A loud "G" from a bugle and an
equally loud order, "Mess Deck, 'Tshun!"
The first time this is heard one involun-
tarily jumps and looks for the origin of
the disturbance. Like all great heroes,
he is quite a short man, though rather
beamy. Being afloat, we unconsciously pick
up these nautical phrases. The new-comer
is apt to think, after seeing the highly
polished combination foot and leg wear, the
neat uniform, shining Sam Brown, stern
tooth-brush moutached face, and cap set
squarely on the head, that he is in the pre-
sence of at least the C.O.Troops. However,
as one's eyes get accustomed to this dazzl-
ing apparition on the dim mess deck, one
sees with relief that three stripes and a
crown adorn the right arm! Still, one
never knows, he may be a general in dis-
guise !
For the information of visitors, the
railed-in portion of D deck is NOT a bar-
ber's .shop, though the sight of a gentleman
—"as you were"—a sergeant, honing razors
at all times of the day and night might give
you the impression that it is.
Visit the mess at meal times—you won't
find them there any other time as they are
of a rather shy disposition—and you will
see a number of poor civilians. As such,
their lot is hard on a khaki ship, as they
can't enter into the daily life of the troops.
And when they reach the Homeland their
lot will be even harder still. But won't we
feel thankful to them, won't we be proud
of them, when our turn comes to use the
material they make.
23/10 QUIPS.
That Pte. Charlie Allen is now of the
opinion that seawater is quite as wet as
fresh, especially when it comes through
a port-hole in the dead of night.
That although not officially gazetted as
yet, Pte. H. Braham has been appointed
right marker for sick parades for the
voyage. Malingerers, please note!
That there is no necessity to allot a
boat to Pte. Will Crooks of 23/10; he
showed his hand at Fremantle.
The money market dropped considerably
the other night, when Bob Beatty fell out
of his hammock.
Robinson Crusoe and his man Friday
has very recently gone out of fashion.
The revised version is R. C. and his girl
"Jinks."
That "Lights Out" should never be
sounded for their unit, as it is impossible
to have darkness while Pte. Christie re-
mains in the unit.
That " 'Arf a Mo" is a very old saying,
but some of the "Arf (a) Moes" on the
Berrima are very, very new.
That it is not a fact that Corporal Solo-
man was a sailor before enlisting.
That any member of 23/10 requiring
physical exercise is recommended to join
the Sandercoek's Pyramid Squad. In
this renowned squad he will learn all
that has been written in books about
physical culture, and probably more.
We are given to understand that this
select squad has performed before the
Prince of Wales, King of Hanover, Duke
of Wellington and many other—hotels.
BOSTON FLOAT.
A HIGHLY INVIGORATING DRINK.
This is a very stimulating drink. Take
a glass of cold water and add one dead fly.
It will float well.


I


8/5 QUIPS.
THEY SAY-:
That the Army training does not com-
pletely eradicate the traits of a man's
former occupation.
That the fact that a prominent member
of this unit formerly earned his living by
mesmerising the local parliament with his
steady eloquence, is apparent by the manner
in which he explains orders as "bill" he is
about to introduce.
That the most important N.C.O. of this
unit is in love.
That this is the only explanation for his
general appearance of living in dreamland.
That in default of anything better to
practice on he kisses his chin strap. (We
pity the girl if this chin-strap kiss is his
usual variety).
That one of our small sergeants is not
content with musical honours.
That he apparently considers his august
presence responsible for this unit winning
the recent tug-of-war. (He wasn't coach
or captain, but considers he should he in
the team photo.)
That other units attribute our vim to
the resin we used.
That we attribute it to our pulling powers
and coaching.
Hear Tom Seller recite "The Bondi
Lady" and you will never regret being born.
A critic on the navigation of the ship has
been unearthed in the unit. Considering
that the largest ship he was on before com-
ing aboard was the Zephyr, you can come
to your own conclusion as to what he really
knows.
The story of a lost clay pipe has been
exciting the attention of members of No. 2
Platoon, but as a handsome reward has been
offered for recovery of same the mystery
may soon be solved.
A prize of a copy of "What I don't
know" will be given to the person failing
to discover the identity of "Lights out on
D Deck."
A popular N.C.O. is very sore over some-
thing that happened at Fremantle which
resulted in him leaving behind his supply
of strawberry jam and chocolates.
The habit of cultivating moustaches has
been taken on very earnestly by several
members of the unit. At this early stage
it is hard to say whether they will be black
or brown.
Why "Barry Woke Up" was preceded
a few nights ago by "Dreg's Downfall"
without limelight effects.
A collection will be taken up in future at
any debate on religion that may take place.
Will those interested please note!
Fair dinkum—not 8/sths either.—Bill :
"What a lovely moon." Jack : "Yes, but
not as large as the moon in Australia."
Is the Australian soldier inferior to the
Tommy was well answered recently by one
of our lads. In fact it was a kind of mov-
ing picture in reality.
So keen are our men in saluting their
officers, that one of them surprised himself
the other day by hitting himself so hard
that he touched bottom backwards.
Quartermaster Lennon has been awarded
so many stripes since he came aboard that
his w 7 ants cannot be supplied by the ship.
THE CHEERY FARE-TH EE-WELL.
From the streaming crowded city,
From the small suburban town,
From the distant Never-Neyer
Where the plains are parched and brown,
From the homestead, from the cottage,
From the mansions of the great,
They have come with faces burning
In their laughing scorn for Fate;
Lads that stir the world with singing—
But within each voice oft dwells
That subduing tone of sorrow
And the sound of fare-thee-wells.
'Twas perchance a midnight parting
'Neath the shadows on the hill.;
Or a long last ride together
Where the gums were sweet and still:
Or a kiss from out the saddle,
Or a distant waved goodbye
Where the dusty mountain cutting
Touched the reddening summer sky.
So they came with pulses throbbing
To the beat of parting knells,
With the memories of homeland
And its tender fare-thee-wells.
Then the transport dark and dismal
Like a saddening ship of sighs—
But I saw the lads had laughter
In their dimmed but tearless eyes
As they chaffed the crowds below them :
And I had the wit to see
Why their merry songs re-echoed
Like their cheering, three times three ;
Why they laughed and yelled and chorused
At a time when parting swells
Wit'h a father's, mother's, sister's
Or a sweetheart's fare-thee-wells.
Yes, the same lads still are singing;
But oft times a searching gaze
Slowly drifts across the distance
To the home of former days
Whence a dream-born breeze of fancy
Comes with tales of homely fun,
Tales of happiness and pleasure
That a pride of blood has won.
For the old folks, friends and sweetheart^
Must be truly proud to tell
Of the lads that left that morning
With that cheery fare-thee-well.
Captain Campbell, A.M,C.
"THE DIRECT ROUTE."
Leaning over the starboard bulwarks of
an ocean-bound troopship in the grey morn-
ing light of a tempestuous day, might have
been seen a sergeant's portly figure, in such
an attitude as to suggest to the casual
passer by the meditations of a nature en-
thusiast. A closer observer, noting the sea-
green complexion and general aspect of hope-
lessness, would have recognised the cld-
time comedy of the "Return of the Swal-
lows." Suddenly the spruce figure of a
mess orderly appeared, and inquired of sea-
sick sergeant : "Will you take your break-
fast on deck this morning, sir?" "No,"
came the prompt rejoinder, "throw it over-
board—save time—and trouble."
PERSONAL PARAGRAPHS.
(Not issued by G.H.Q. in W.A.)
How does matrimony appeal to Lieut.
Silverston and Lieut. Summers, both of
whom should he competent to give am
opinion ?
Ask Lieut. Coulthard how long it takes
to walk from No. 3 Training Battalion
Headquarters to Camp Headquarters at
Blackboy? He is bound to know —if not,
ask the O.C. 8/48. ("He's a cert.")
A book which should be read by all
young officers before leaving W.A. is "The
Way to Embark and how to do it," by
Lieut. Stubbs.
In our last report re the Camp Sport* at
Blackboy, an item of great interest was un-
fortunately left out—i.e., the Infants' Han-
dicap, which was finished in A 1 style, Lieut.
Webster beating Lieut. McGillivray by a
short head. Lieut. J. Simons was the
handicapper. The result has been posted up
at D.H.Q.
Why is it that so much noise emanates
from the W.A. table in the saloon. Ask
Mr. Stubbs.
We note with much pleasure that a cer-
tain W.A. officer has not been absent with-
out leave since the boat left Fremantle.
Apparently dominoes is a fascinating game
(Not as good as 48, eh?).
The embarkation of the W.A. units was
a revelation to all S.A. officers, and we
should like to draw their attention to that
fact also the fact that it is possible for men
to embark without papers, nominal rolls,
et/C., irrespective of certain details hid
down in orders. An item which by the way
is usually issued by the W.A. authorities
after everything is completed.
Singing a song of W.A.
And papers incomplete,
Makes the Adjutant turn away
And the C.O. stamp his feet.
Never mention "hair cut" to a W.A.
sergeant —it is a sore point with them.
Surely Silvie and Summers seriously con-
sidered the sweet subject of settling down
—Why then this sudden severance from the
Land of Sin, Sand, and Sorrow.

THE SERGEANT-MAJOR
'Tis a very fascinating job : That's a cert !
To be a Sergeant-Major, the C.O.'s handy-
man;
With a thundering gait and more or less
alert,
To concentrate attention on the ranks —if
he can.
Just think ! 'Tis he who on parade must
call the roll;
With ruthless energy he notes the absentees,
And then stands by—of course, he's "on
parole"—
To give a helping hand to anyone who needs.
A useful man in many ways, 'tis true;
But, with due respect to Army etiquette,
Contrives at times more than e'en he can do,
If it's only just to get the right effect.
The work he does impresses one;
At reveille, clad in khaki,
Comes below and draws attention—
'Tis not right in bed to be.
Now then, lads. Quick ! Up you get!
Parade this morning, don't forget !"
At sundry hours he can be seen,
"Not to be touched," but just on view-
To give advice to those who've been
Silly enough to give him the cue.
He stands aloof, a man of men,
The pride of few, the butt of all,
And in his train he leaves behind
Many thoughts of divers kind.
When all is said and done,
Though not the Regimental Pet,
He oft as not will take in fun
What he may get, and more—you bet !

ENTERTAINMENT COMMITTEE.
Our columns would be incomplete without
a few words of congratulation for the most
successful manner, and also of apprecia-
tion to the Entertainment Comittee for
their untiring energy in the promotion
of sports, competitions, and concerts, which
have tended to relieve the monotony and
pass away the time of what would other-
wise have been a somewhat dreary voyage.
The following gentlemen comprise the Com-
mittee : President, Chaplain Rev. E.
Arnold; secretary, N. Wynne Opie; Com-
mittee, Capt. Campbell, Sergts. Patterson,
Buggins, Bryant, Johnson, Boyce, Corpls.
Brent, Jopson, Buck, Ray, Sehinkel, Davies,
Moore, Bonnett, and Messrs. Green, Malley
and Opie.
MISSING FRIENDS.
Wanted to know, the whereabouts of
Private Mcßride ; last heard of as chief in-
structor at Burford's soap works , as
Private Morytz wishes to interview him at
the waterworks- on urgent and necessary
business. Any person supplying the required
information to the Sanitary Inspectors
Office, will receive a substantial reward.
8/51 QUIPS.
THEY SAY—
That moustache competitions was keenly
among the three-striped brigade.
That some are hardly visible even with
the aid of a microscope.
That our Mascots are training hard for
the rick-a-sha rides.
That springs will need reinforcing before
the city is viewed by our anchor man.
That one of our clan performances on
physical parades will do credit at a cana-
balistie prayer offering.
That "Bull" Thomas is a glutton for
"gore."
That sparring partners are not forthcom-
ing as rapidly as would please our "fighting
cock.''
That two of the 8/51 sergeants have
sworn everlasting matrimony.
That a reward is offered for the first man
discovering them apart.
That the Orderly Sergeant records no
crimes up-to-date.
That Mick will have a standing order
when he arrives at the next port.
That beer and crayfish suppers being cut
out, he is feeling terribly well.
Th t we boast the biggest promotion
aboard the troopship—some 18 stones.
That the final tug between 8/50 and 3/51
was worth travelling thousands of knots
to "sea."
That the "Gropers" proved their superi-
ority over the "Brow-beaters."
Tint our 18-stone anchor proved too
firmly embedded.
This is the latest Company
That left to fight its foes,
And the backbone of this unit
Is it's gallant N.C.O.'s.
They had a very pleasant trip
Across Australia's bight
And they learnt to mount their hammocks
At ta-too every night.
Three burly B.'s there are on board,
From them enjoyment comes,
For one can fight and one can swear,
The third a laundry runs.
They're now quite used to board-ship life,
But the thing they most deplore
Is the week-end leave of absence
As they cannot get ashore.
12/32.
LIMERICK.
Though he often has reason to snort,
We all think our C.O. a sport,
But in W.A.
There'll be hell to pay
When Headquarters gets his report.
What are the ingredients of a "double
lemon squash?"
