LIST OF BOOKS IN PREPARATION
AUSTRALIAN ART BOOKS
The object of the series is to provide a little record of the work
of the leading Australian Artists.
Though each book is by no means exhaustive, it has been the
endeavour of the artists, the authors, and the publishers, to give
in each a typical record of each man’s best work.
The Publisher takes this opportunity of heartily thanking the
various ladies and gentlemen, and particularly the trustees of the
National Gallery, Melbourne, for their courtesy in allowing pictures
in their possession to be reproduced in these books.

Frederick McGubbin
A Consideration
By Alexander Golquhuon
THE late Frederick McGubbin was born in
1865, his father being Alexander Mc-
Cubbin, master baker, of King-street,
West Melbourne. He was one of a
family of six children, and though from the
beginning fame credits him with strong artis-
tic propensities, his art productions showed
little sign of that brilliant immaturity which
so often characterises the work of youthful
genius, and his promise for the future lay
more—to the seeing eye—in the absolute sin-
cerity and single-mindedness of his outlook, and
in his unchanging fidelity, so far as conditions
permitted, to nature.
In those days of the late eighties the facilities
open to art students in Melbourne were limited
to a primitive drawing school at the National
Gallery, and an equally primitive Art Society,
which held annual exhibitions on Eastern Hill,
both sincere movements in their way, but both
hopelessly out of touch with the progressive re-
quirements of the hour and of the man. Conse-

quently the efforts of the young artist, though
based on sound enough general principles, were
in the main ill-directed.
Painting as then taught at the Gallery was con-
fined to copying the pictures in the rather meagre
national collection, the class being attended chiefly
by young lady students, some of whom made good
financial use of their opportunities by turning
out frequent imitations of such popular works as
“The Poultry Vendor” or “The Fern Gatherer.”
In the midst of these unpromising conditions,
but not of them, worked three young men—Fred
McCubbin, Tom Roberts and C. D. Richardson—
each viewing art from a different temperamental
standpoint, but in accord in so far as the main
issue was concerned.
These three formed, not without opposition, a
life class at the Gallery, where they drew from
the nude in a somewhat furtive and conscious
fashion, for the public mind had not then been
educated up to the point of nice discrimination
in such matters.
In the absence of any definitely established laws
for their guidance, these pioneers fell back to a
certain extent on the thought of the old world,
and showed a tendency to seek inspiration from
Shakespeare or the pagan mythologies; but this
phase passed, and gave place in time to a more
direct and individual method of working.

“DOWN
ON HIS LUCK.”
[F. McCubhin.




FREDERICK McCUBBIN.
Two old exponents of Australian landscape were
alive at this time, Von Guerard and Louis Buve-
lot, the former being teacher at the Gallery
school and a painter of a limited type. Buvelot
was a worker of a different calibre, and his influ-
ence for good was felt and appreciated by the
young men of his day, who, like those to come
after them, owe much to the uplifting impetus
his genius gave to Australian art. The departure
of Von Guerard and the advent of G. F. Folingsby
as Director of the National Gallery was an event
which strongly influenced the hitherto wayward
artistic progress of Fred McCubbin.
A school was now formed at the Gallery which,
however much it may have fallen short of the
possible, was, comparatively speaking, a revela-
tion of method and efficiency.
One of the first to enter the new school, McCub-
bin studied assiduously, though his time was then
much taken up in helping to carry on the family
business, left without a head through the death
of his father.
He adapted himself readily to the changed con-
ditions and made rapid progress, taking leading
place in the first of the now long series of Gallery
annual exhibitions; but the strain of the ill-assor-
ted double duties proved almost too much for the
aspiring student, and at one time, in a spirit of
despair, he put art from him for a space of six


FREDERICK McCUBBIN.
months, only to return to it again with renewed
ardour when the mood of despondency had passed.
As senior student in the Folingsby school,
McCubbin was associated with E. P. Fox, John
Longstaff (winner of the first travelling scholar-
ship) , T. St. G. Tucker, J. J. Gibbs, and the pre-
sent writer, of which group only two survive to-
day.
The work of the school consisted primarily in
drawing from the antique, then in painting still-
life and portraiture in the studios, which were at
that time temporary canvas erections in the
Statue Gallery, and later on subject compositions,
the earliest development of the scholarship pic-
ture.
The first of these compositions was painted by
McCubbin under the title “Home Again.” It was
in some respects an elementary performance, and
the theme and arrangement presented no special
difficulties—just a cottage interior with a woman
engaged in some domestic duty and a man rush-
ing in at the open door; yet its production cost
the painter much thought and strenuous applica-
tion before he succeeded in satisfying the fas-
tidious Folingsby. The picture was shown at the
second Gallery Exhibition, and it is worthy to
be remembered as being the forerunner of the
more matured and important performances of
the “Down on His Luck” period.






FREDERICK McCUBBIN.
Shortly after this the artist was, on the death
of Mr. 0. R. Campbell, appointed drawing instruc-
tor at the Gallery, a position which he retained
with credit and efficiency till his death.
Folingsby was pre-eminently a studio painter,
even when out-door subjects were in question;
while the more robust and progressive instinct of
McCubbin called him to the open air and the sun-
shine, so that when he ceased to be a pupil of the
school he dropped many of its mannerisms, such as
indoor landscape and the free use of bitumen; yet
some of the dicta of his teacher, particularly the
oft-repeated injunction to “keep it broad and
simple and get good drawing into it,” remained
with him to the end.
The return of Tom Roberts from England,
where he had spent some years studying at the
Royal Academy Schools, primed with whatever
was the latest in art, was something of an event,
and his influence on McCubbin, which was as
much personal as artistic, proved an uplifting
and helpful one. Roberts tabooed bitumen
shadows, preached the healthy gospel of sin-
cerity, and presently a new trio was afoot with
Arthur Streeton, then a young and newly dis-
covered genius, taking the place of Richardson,
who, like Roberts, had gone to England, not to
return till some years later.
These three, whose watchword was the some-


FREDERICK McCUBBIN.
what exclusive one of “let the strong men keep
together,” instituted a new cult—which might be
termed the Box Hill cult, from the locality where
its first painting camp was established—and
though the direct motive of the three was their
own personal advancement, they, at this stage in
their climbing, raised the standard of Australian
Art to a higher level than it had yet reached.
“Down on His Luck,” the first of the series
of important and topically Australian pictures,
upon which the popular reputation of the artist
largely rests, was painted during these halcyon
days, and about this time (1889) the trio became
a quartette by the addition to its numbers of a
shy youth named Charles Condor, a wayward
genius destined to achieve fame in after years—
years, unfortunately, too few and troubled to
bear the entire fulfilment of his promise.
In 1894 the artist and his wife—for he was
now married—went to live at Blackburn, close
to Box Hill, where he painted “The Bush Burial,”
and it is characteristic of the sincerity of pur-
pose which pervaded all his dealings with art
that in painting it he should dig a little grave
in his back yard and pose Mrs. McCubbin (who
was ever to him as a modern Saskia) on the
brink in the character of the bereaved and grief-
stricken mother. The obvious leaning in the art
of Frederick McCubbin in the direction of ar-
ranged and descriptive compositions was fostered

BUSH BURIAL.”

FREDERICK McCUBBIN.
by his training under Folingsby, whose views,
though fundamentally sound, were biassed by the
unstable traditions of the German school of
Piloty and Hans Markart.
In dealing with the story picture, however, the
artist unfailingly made the painting his first
care, and never at any time descended to use
his art as a frame on which to hang a narrative.
Much futility has been written and spoken con-
cerning the subject picture. We know that Mil-
lais did, and that Whistler didn’t, and that a
great percentage of such pictures were produced
less to express any truth, or even heresy, in art
than to perpetuate the awful mid-Victorian prin-
ciple that “every true work of art should tell its
own story.” With McCubbin the case was mate-
rially different, and in painting descriptively he
used the life and environment of his country as
he found it, in a manner more analagous in spirit
to the early Flemish painters than to those of his
own time. In later pictures, such as “The Pio-
neers” and “Lost in the Bush,” the latter painted
in 1907, there is a marked change in the quality
of the work; it is looser and more suggestive, yet
at the same time more matured in treatment, and
clear for ever from the restraints of the school
which are traceable in the earlier works.
Apart from picture producing this painter took
an active share in most of the local art movements


FREDERICK McCUBBIN.
of his time, and was one of the band of revolu-
tionary students who, in the days of the old Aca-
demy of Arts, made successful war upon obsolete
dogmatisms, and lived to be the leader of a group
of veteran conservatives in art, facing boldly the
onslaught of a new generation of revolutionaries.
The part McCubbin took, in conjunction with
John Ford Paterson, G. R. Ashton, Walter With-
ers, John Mather, C. D. Richardson and others
in the building up of the Victorian Artists’ So-
ciety was a strenuous one, and his big vigorous
canvases often gave a saving air of substance and
reality to the exhibitions, which they would other-
wise have lacked.
He was several times president of the Society,
and resigned definitely and finally about 1908, in
conjunction with a number of contemporaries,
among whom were John Mather and Walter
Withers, to form the more restful and conserva-
tive Australian Art Association, of which
body he remained a highly valued member and
contributor until his death.
McCubbin in his time painted many portraits,
and, though his work in this respect shows in-
equalities, the best examples, including those of
his friend, the late Louis Abrahams, and the late
J. A. Panton, P.M., place him in the front rank
of Australian portrait painters.

“THE
PIONEERS.”
[F. McCubbin.




FREDERICK McCUBBIN.
1901 was an event in the McCubbin family, and
from this time dates the fine series of mountain
landscapes on which the artist’s later reputation
is chiefly built, one of the first being the triptych
“Pioneers,” now hanging in the Melbourne
National Gallery. Others followed in quick suc-
cession, works less literal in execution than the
earlier ones, but full of a new and happy inspira-
tion.
A further fateful movement was the removal,
after many suburban sojournings, of the town
address to Kensington-road, South Yarra, the
residence being quite an ancient house, dating
back over seventy years, to the time when South
Yarra was a sheep run, and commanding a wide
outlook over the river, the city and its north-
eastern environments. It proved an exceptional
painting ground, different from Macedon, but
with a splendid space value of its own. A typical
example of the work done there is “Moonrise,”
painted in 1909.
While living here the artist, who had so far,
with the exception of a trip to Tasmania, never
been out of Australia, decided to visit Europe.
The opportunity came late in life, but was none
the less acceptable on that account, and a year
spent in London, Paris and Italy came as a reve-
lation in fact, of the glories hitherto known only
through the media of reproduction or written
description.


FREDERICK McCUBBIN.
The sudden transition from the still waters of
Australia to what may be termed the vortexes of
art, and the amount of new experience he was
called upon to absorb in a short space of time,
was almost too great for even his large capacity,
and for a term after his return he found it diffi-
cult to settle down to the normal stride of his
peculiar genius. The sense of confusion passed,
however, leaving only a treasure of vivid and
enduring memories, which gave added sparkle
and interest to the artist’s well-known qualities
as a conversationalist.
Many notable pictures were now painted,
among them the self portrait purchased by the
Adelaide National Gallery, “Hauling Timber,
Macedon,” and the portrait of his old friend,
Mr. Harry Abrahams.
For about two years before his death Mr.
McCubbin suffered from a bronchial affection,
which, though intermittent in its nature, became
by slow degrees worse, causing at first lapses in
his life work, and finally entire cessation.
Apart from his purely professional qualities
this painter possessed in a higher degree than
any of his contemporaries in art a strong and
attractive individuality, in which even the fail-
ings leaned to virtue’s side. With all his socia-
bility one word of two letters frequently found
him tongue-tied; but his failure to utter it was
generally owing to the fear of hurting someone

ese’s feelings—possibly an entirely unworthy
someone. He was an extensive and discriminat-
iig reader, particularly in the direction of bio-
graphy and the higher fiction, and it was his
cmmon habit to memorise what he read and
dliver it to the first receptive friend he came
aross in the form of a brief but glowing epitomy.
The occasion may have been the opening of an
ehibition or a chance meeting in a tram, and
wth another man the thing might have proved
bresome, but with McCubbin never.
During a long knowledge of him I never heard
hm express any very definite views on religious
mtters, yet his attitude in this respect did not
fil in reverence or in a generous trust in the
irimate larger hope.
My last memory of Fred McCubbin was an
iformal visit he paid me at my home one Sun-
dy morning. We smoked a contemplative cigar-
e:e together, talking reminiscently over old
tnes, and more intimately of the present, of the
vir and what it had meant for both of us, of
hs soldier sons, Hugh (wounded on Gallipoli),
Duis (the artist, in camp), and my own boy who
vould not come back.
The vehement book talk was gone with the
oi militant art spirit once so characteristic of
hn, and in its place the restfulness and tolerance
o a man who saw above and beyond these things.


FREDERICK McCUBBIN.
He died at his home in South Yarra two weeks
later on, leaving a widow and a family of two
daughters and four sons, the elder of whom bids
fair to fill his father’s place in the world of Aus-
tralian Art.
