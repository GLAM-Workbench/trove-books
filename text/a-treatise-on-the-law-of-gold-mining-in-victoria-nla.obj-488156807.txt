PREFACE.
With the exception of Atkins’s Notes to
the Mining Statute and McFarland’s admir-
able Digest, no work devoted entirely to the
Law of Mining in Victoria has been published ;
and as, since the last publication of the Digest
in 1881, various changes have taken place in
the statute law, and numerous judgments have
been delivered expounding that law, it is con-
sidered that this work will be found useful to
the members of the profession as well as to
others holding or acquiring mining interests.
A work of this nature, though the result of
the study and practice of a number of years,
must necessarily be imperfect in many respects.
When consideration is given to the facts that
the whole of our mining law is founded on sta-
tutes for which no precedent existed in any
other country; that such statutes were made
and repealed from time to time as occasion re-
quired; that judgments on the construction of
an Act since repealed do not necessarily apply
to an existing Act; that many of the judg-
ments are based on the construction of by-laws,
which have been successively amended or re


pealed ; and that the author’s task was not
only to reconcile as far as possible the numer-
ous decisions upon which the construction of
our mining law is based, but to weave together
into one strand the various sources from which
such law is derived—to compare the many
statutes, by-laws and regulations which form
the mining code of the colony—and to elimin-
ate therefrom such portions as have become
obsolete or useless; it is felt that no apology is
necessary for any errors or omissions which
may have occurred in the performance of the
task.
As the mining law of Victoria is a law stand-
ing by itself, originating within the colony, and
not in any way affected by the decisions of the
English courts (except as regard appeals to the
Privy Council), reference has been made only
to cases arising within the colony, and decided
by the Victorian courts. Each of these cases
has been carefully studied, whether it be in
connection with the statutes or with the by-
laws under which the cases arose ; the digest
of the reported cases has been utilized where
the head lines of the reports have seemed to
constitute a fair digest of the cases, but these
head lines have not been implicitly relied on by
the author without having been carefully ex-
amined with the reports they refer to.
The law of mining companies does not come
within the scope of this work, and has not been


touched upon, except so far as a company may
be considered as the holder of a claim or a
lease, or as a party to a suit. It was also
found necessary to considerably curtail the
chapters on the Procedure and Practice of the
Mining Courts, in order to keep within the
prescribed limits of the volume. For these,
however, the reader is referred to the Act
itself and to the rules thereunder, which must
in any event form the basis of the procedure of
the courts.
The consolidation of the statute mining law
has had the effect of materially altering the
numbers of the sections of the former Acts,
and in order to afford greater facilities for re-
ference to the reports of cases cited (which of
course refer only to the various Acts and sec-
tions in force at the time of the decisions) the
sections of the former Acts have been retained
in the text, and the corresponding sections of
the Consolidated Act have been bracketed
with them.
The appendix to the volume contains the
Consolidated Mines Act 1890 and its amend-
ments, and also the regulations in force relating
to mining leases.

THE
LAW OF GOLD MINING,
ETC.
INTRODUCTORY.
The growth of a law in a new country, and under
new circumstances, will naturally develope with the
growth of the necessity which requires that law. So
it was with the Mining Law of Victoria from the time
of the first gold-fields proclamation in August, 1851, up
to the date of the present extensive mining code of the
colony, numerous regulations having been made and
Acts passed successively, as occasion arose from time to
time for any amendment of or addition to the existing
law.
At the time of the first discovery of gold no mining
law whatever was in existence in New South Wales,
of which Victoria then formed a part, and the first
gold-fields law of the colonies was contained in a pro-
clamation issued on August, 15th, 1851, notifying that
any person taking from any lands within the colony
any gold or gold ore, or digging or disturbing the soil
in any lands then unalienated from the Crown without
being duly authorised to do so would be prosecuted.

Growth of the
Mining Law.

Introductory.
License to mine.
The first Mining
Act.
The authority referred to was given by license to
take up as a claim in which to mine for gold a small
area of Crown land limited by the proclamation on
payment of a monthly fee to the Crown. The term
and fee of this license were subsequently altered from
time to time, as was also the area allowed to be taken
up or pegged out. This license was required to be
produced by its owner whenever he should be called
upon to produce it, and the many harassing searches
made for these licenses, and the arrests of numerous
diggers who failed to produce them when called on,
known at the time as “digger-hunting,” gave rise to
many serious outbreaks amongst the miners on the
various diggings of the colony, which culminated in
the formidable riots at Ballarat.
But though every attention was devoted by the
Government to the protection of the revenue derived
from these mining licenses, yet the miner himself had
no redress beyond physical force against the trespasser
who jumped or encroached on his claim ; and it was
not until January, 1852, that any legal means was
available for the settlement of disputes between diggers
with regard to trespass and encroachment. This means
of redress was, however, granted to a certain extent by
the first Mining Act of the colonies, which was passed
in January, 1852 (a), and which authorised the ap-
pointment of certain officers called Gold Commissioners
who were empowered to enquire into disputes between
miners and determine them in a summary way.
The powers of the Gold Commissioners were con-
tinued by an act passed in the following year (h) which
(a) 15 Vic. No. 15—“ An Act
to restrain by summary proceed-
ings unauthorised mining on
waste lands of the Crown.”
(h) 17 Vic. No. 4—“ An Act
for the better management of
the gold-fields of the colony of
Victoria.”


also authorised two justices to award compensation for
encroachment and trespass to an amount not exceeding
£2OO, and also to hear and settle disputes between
mates or partners.
This method of dealing out justice was of the
roughest fashion, and there was no appeal from a
determination once given. The Gold Commissioner,
an officer whose place was subsequently filled by the
Chairman of the Local Court and afterwards by the
Warden, held his rough court where he pleased, and
usually settled any dispute by visiting the claims and
giving his decision on the spot, and that decision was
final and conclusive.
• A subsequent Act (c) passed in June, 1855, repealed
the previous Act and established the license to mine,
substituting for it the “miner’s right” in a somewhat
similar form to the present document, and also autho-
rising the issue of business licenses and mining leases.
The office of Gold Commissioner was also abolished,
and for the administration of mining law local courts
were instituted, consisting of a chairman appointed by
the Governor and nine holders of miner’s rights, who
were elected by the great body of miners in the local
court district. These local courts had power to frame
regulations in the nature of by-laws to regulate the
taking up and working of claims and the settlement
of disputes between miners. By proclamation made
on June 29th, 1855, five mining districts were named,
each of which had its local court instituted as above.
The Goldfields Act (cl) which came into operation on ' J
June Ist, 1858, effected a still further reform in the
mining law. It was by this Act that Wardens of the

Introductory.
The Mining
Statute 1865,
No. 291.
Principles of the
Act.
Goldfields were created with jurisdiction to decide
cases of title to claims, encroachment and trespass*
forfeiture and abandonment, subject to the right of
appeal from their decisions to the District Courts of
Mines, which were also first created by this Act, and
from which latter courts a right of appeal lay to the
Supreme Court. The Act also authorised the appoint-
ment of elective bodies called Mining Boards, on which
were conferred power to make by-laws regulating the
taking up and working of claims in place of the former
local court regulations. The chairmen of the several
local courts were appointed the first Wardens.
With the development of mining, however, this Act
was found to fall short of the requirements of the gold-
fields, and the Mining Statute 1865, the result of a
Royal Commission on the mining industry, came into
operation on January Ist, 1866 (e).
The general principles of the Act No. 32 were
adhered to in the Act No. 291, by which Act, however,
they were greatly enlarged and extended. The juris-
diction of the Warden and of the Court of Mines was
more clearly defined, and a new court of appeal was
erected, called the court of the Chief Judge of Courts
of Mines, to which court appeal might be had from the
Court of Mines; and both the Warden and the Judge
of the Court of Mines had the right of stating a case
on any question of the law arising in any proceeding
before him for the opinion of the Chief Judge. This
new court, however, was abolished by The Judicature
Act 1883 (f), and the jurisdiction given by The Mining
Statute 1865 to the Chief Judge is now vested in the
Supreme Court.
(/) 47 Vic. No. 761.
(e) 29 Vic. No. 291.


The many weighty and lucid decisions and opinions
of the Chief Judge of this new court in the numerous
and complicated cases that were brought before him,
and the judgments on the Equity side of the Supreme
Court, have in a great measure reduced the mining
law of the colony to a comparatively firm and settled
basis, and though these opinions and judgments were
given to meet cases applicable only to the time at
which they were delivered, they nevertheless form a
solid foundation for the superstructure of mining law
which has been built up on them.
From the earliest times possession and occupation
have always been regarded as the strongest title to a
mining claim. “ The title to mine on the Crown lands
of Victoria from their first being let open to miners
has been based on possession, the first person taking
such possession under restrictions imposed being held
to have the best right” (g). In fact the whole essence
of The Mining Statute rests on two propositions: a
title at law and occupation (h). The title is the
miner’s right, and the occupation is obtained by taking
up in conformity with the by-laws.
But no man may take more ground than his miner’s
right entitles him to take. “The obvious general
meaning of the Act,” says Molesworth, Chief Judge
(i), “is to enable all persons paying for documents
called miners’ rights a small tax—which may be quite
disproportionate to the value of the property obtain-
able—to take possession of Crown lands and mine, the
first person occupying thereby obtaining title. But
it is obviously necessary for the interests of miners to

prevent a first occupant taking more than a reason-
able share of public property at under-value, and
obstructing the industry of all others to whom equal
encouragement was due.”
The various mining boards are within the several
districts authorised to limit the quantity of ground to
be taken, and to define the events in which claims shall
be liable to forfeiture. It has been said that the
mining boards have outlived their usefulness. But if
we consider what would necessarily be the substitute
provided in lieu of them we shall see that they are
not altogether useless. The members of a mining
board live in and are acquainted with the mining dis-
trict they .represent, and in nearly all instances they
are practical miners, having an intimate knowledge of
the requirements of their district. No doubt the
mining code is somewhat complicated by the powei
given to those miniature parliaments to make separate
and distinct laws for their several districts ; but having
regard to the individual interests of each district, as
much uniformity as possible is maintained in all the
by-laws. The sweeping away of the mining boards
would suggest the remedy of Government regulations
in lieu of by-laws, but if these regulations were made
to apply to each separate and distinct mining district
the same complications would result, and possibly in
an exaggerated form, as under the present by-laws;
whilst on the other hand regulations for the taking
up, marking out, registration and working of claims,
made applicable to the whole colony, would prove un-
workable. The same by-law or legulations undei
which are worked the sluicing claims of the Gipps-
land mountains, and the water and other rights ap-
purtenant thereto, would be utterly inapplicable to
the old workings of the Castlemaine goldfield, or the
deep reefs of Sandhurst and Stawell.


The mining law of Victoria, as it at present exists
has been established on the several Goldfields Acts and
the by-laws, and no doubt serious litigation would ensue
were the principles of the Act interfered with in this
respect. Mr. Justice Molesworth, whilst acting as Chief
Judge, always urged uniformity in the by-laws as
nearly as was possible, the great object of which, he
says, “ ought to be to govern all property by the im-
movable principles of common law as far as applicable,
and by the principles of equity as far as would meet
the deficiencies of the common law ; and to establish a
sort of code as affecting the interests of all persons
alike ” ( j).
Perhaps one of the best proofs of the usefulness of
the by-law system can be found in the old frontage
by-laws or local court regulations of Ballarat. The
idea of frontage claims could only emanate from a
practical miner, and though the frontage system has
been for many years obsolete, except in a modified form,
still there can be no doubt of the value of the system
at the time it was introduced. The object of tracing
and defining new leads was accomplished, and it was
only with the progress of mining that the system be-
came cumbersome. So long as the frontage parallels
covered only the lead on which the one frontage claim
was registered, no difficulty was experienced, but when
litigation ensued in respect of boundaries to frontage
claims, and claims on junctioned leads, or of the return
of leads back within the frontage parallels from beyond
the registered boundary, it was then seen that the
system was inefficient. It was intended rather as a
prospecting system than as a regular working code,
and as such it answered its purposes.

Introductory.
Critchley v.
Graham.
Act No. 446.
The decision o£ the Supreme Court in Critchley v.
Graham (1c) has always been strenuously adhered to
by the courts, and the case may be regarded as a
leading one in mining law. The policy of the mining
laws of Victoria has been uniformly opposed to taking
possession for mining purposes of unoccupied Crown
land until the existing occupation has been determined
by the decree of a court of justice. The case of
Critchley v. Graham was decided under The Goldfields
Act (No. 32) Sec. 77. It was there held that in cases
where there had been a forfeiture or a constructive
abandonment, persons wishing to avail themselves of
such forfeiture or abandonment must take proceedings
before the Warden in order to obtain possession, and
that they could not enter as upon vacant ground. In
Barlow v. Hayes (I) it was held that the Legislature
had adhered to the same policy when it passed The
Mining Statute 1865 (No. 291) now in force in its
consolidated form. In Mulcahy v. Walhalla Co. (m)
the Privy Council referred to a by-law of a district
founded on the same policy as being “ a most wise law,
that no person should take possession by his own
authority of any ground claimed to be occupied by any
other person.” The scope and consequence of these
decisions are shown by the cases of Moore v. White (n)
and Beavan v. Rigby (o), where it was laid down that
even a Warden’s order of forfeiture does not give a
title to the forfeited land; that it merely clears away
the old title, and establishes a right for miners to pro-
ceed to make a title for themselves by marking out the
ground and registering as on a new title.
A later Act of Parliament (p), maintains the same

policy, whilst it qualifies the legal rule. By sec. 27 of
that Act, a claim apparently unoccupied, and which
may he deemed abandoned, may be taken up under a
miner’s right without an adjudication of forfeiture or
abandonment, and subject to the rights, if any, of the
previous occupant. The policy of the Legislature,
which has been happily termed a “ peace preserving-
policy,” forbids that land should be taken up under a
miner’s right so long as there is danger of a collision
with, or resistance by, a previous occupier. Where the
fact of the termination of the tenancy is
and there is no one really in possession to contest the
right of possession, such danger does not exist, and the
ground may be taken up under a miner’s right without
previous adjudication ( q ).
The like rule applies where a contention in which a
lessee lias no part arises between two persons, one of
whom has marked out the land for a claim before the
expiration of the lease (r). But so long as a lessee is
in apparent possession, and is present to defend his
possession against strangers, the holders of miners’
rights cannot intrude (s).
The opinion of the Chief Judge in Coles \. SpciTtu
(t) established a principle in mining law which was
found to work so harshly that several of the mining
boards introduced a by-law to meet the difficulty. In
the case in question the defendants, occupieis of a claim,
obtained protection registration for three months under
the by-laws, and on the expiration of the time renewed
their protection registration for a further term of three

months. The plaintiffs having given them notice of
intention to claim the ground, by reason of forfeiture,
the defendants at once proceeded to work without re-
marking the ground but relying on their old title, and
the plaintiffs applied to the Warden to be put in pos-
session. On a case stated, the opinion of the Chief
Judge (u) was that the resuming work by the defend-
ants without abandoning their old title did not cure
the forfeiture previously incurred, irrespective of the
necessity of stirring old pegs on claiming to hold old
ground under a new title.
The same principle was further established in the
case of Clerk v. Wrigley (v) where the Chief Judge
(w) said “I feel the immense hardship and incon-
venience of shaking titles to claims once subject to
forfeiture and afterwards efficiently worked before
process, and regret that the by-law fixed no limita-
tion to the time of enforcing forfeiture. Coles v.
Sparta rests upon peculiar circumstances. In cases
merely under the Act No. 32 it might be said title
consists in possession. A person whose title is for-
feited has as good a right to take possession as other
people—his resuming work is as good as a retaking of
possession. But it is not so easy to apply such re-
suming under by-laws giving title and providing-
registration, &c.”
But where a by-law was made-to remedy this very
defect, and empowered steps to be taken to enforce a
forfeiture so long as the ground of forfeiture con-
tinued, but provided that if before any such steps
were taken the claimholder resumed a proper working
of his claim, then his liability for past delinquencies

should cease, Mr. Justice Webb decided that the by-
law was valid, and that a claimholder working his
claim with the requisite number of men subsequently
to the forfeiture would redeem a title forfeited by a
previous noncompliance with the by-laws (a?).
The law of mining on private property, which was
built up on numerous decisions extending over a num-
ber of years, was completely swept aside by the pass-
ing of The Mining on Private Property Act 1884 (y).
Previous to the passing of this enactment, as it had
been established that all gold mines were the property
of the Crown, there was no legal means available of
mining on land alienated from the Crown, though such
mining was carried on to a large extent by means of
a lease or licence to mine granted for what it was
worth by the freeholder to the miner, who was per-
mitted to remove and appropriate the gold with the
tacit consent of the Crown.
Under The Mining on Private Property Act 1884,
however, the Crown asserted its right to royal mines,
and the tacit consent theretofore given found visible
form in the shape of a mining lease from the Crown,
authorising mining for gold (0) on private property,
subject to compensation being made to the owner and
occupier of the freehold for surface damage, which
compensation may be arrived at by agreement between
the owner and the miner, or in cases of non-agreement
by decision of the Warden or the Court of Mines.

SECTION 1.-PRIVILEGES CONFERRED BY THE MINER’S

The document known as a miner’s right was intro-

issued by the Crown, and is usually issued to remain in
force for one year from the date of issue (a)- The
miner’s right was first substituted for the license to
mine by the Goldfields Act passed in July, 1855 (h),
which granted certain privileges to the holders of
miners’ rights, and these privileges were subsequently

enlarged by The Goldfields Act (c), and have been still
further extended by The Mining Statute 1865 (d) in
section 5 of which Act the privileges conferred by a
miner’s right are fully set out [No. 1120 sec. 5.] This
Act, besides giving the holder of a miner’s right power
(except as against the Queen) to take possession for
gold mining purposes of so much Crown land as the
by-laws permit, confers numerous other ancillary
privileges which are conferred by no other single
document issued by the Crown (c). The reservation
“save as against the Queen” does not reserve to the
Crown any royalty on the gold obtained from a claim
held under miner’s right, but only means that during
the continuance of the miner’s right the Crown may
revoke the title by exempting the land from occupation
under miner’s right (/), and except for this reservation
the title acquired under a miner’s right is good against
the world. Indeed, a miner’s right may be regarded as
a kind of title-deed for the parcel of Crown land or
easement held under it during its currency ( g ), but only
subject to its being renewed on its expiration, for if a
claimholder ceases to hold a miner’s right the fact of his
allowing it to lapse may be taken as corobborative
evidence of an intention to abandon the claim or pro-
perty held under it ( h ).
Thus the interest of a claimholder in his claim under
a miner’s right is as against the Crown at the utmost
an estate at will (i), the occupation under it being legal

only during the currency of the miner’s right, though
such occupation is paramount to every other title,
except as against the Queen ( j ), and may be con-
sidered, except as against the Queen, in the nature of
a permanent estate.
A miner’s right may be granted to “any person
applying for the same on payment of a sum of ss. for
every year for which the same is to be in force” (k) ;
and though not directly so stated in the Mines Act,
the intention of the Act is that a person cannot hold
.more than one miner’s right in his own name, on the
assumption that the course of justice will not struggle
against the fiscal policy of the law (I). Neither under
the Act is one person enabled to multiply himself or
his powers by multiplying his miners’ rights, or ob-
taining a number of miners’ rights in his own name
(m). But the mining board by-laws may lawfully
permit the holder of one miner’s right to take up and
hold a stated number of men’s ground under it (n) ;
though it is doubtful whether a by-law enacting that
multiplied quantities of ground might be taken up by
one man by multiplying his miners’ rights would not
be ultra vires ( o).
The usual number of men’s ground permitted by the
various by-laws to be taken up and held under one
miner’s right is fifty, though of course on application
for the ground and registration of the claim under the
by-laws a separate fee iffpayable for each man’s ground
taken up, the limit as to dimensions and boundaries of
the claim being fixed by the by-laws (p).

Other privileges.
A miner’s right authorizes the holder of it to take
for mining purposes only such Crown land as is not
legally in the occupation of another, and he has no
right to enter or search for gold on ground held by
another person under miner’s right or mining lea,so
( q ); nor has he any authority under his miner’s right
to enter on and take gold from land alienated from
the Crown (r); neither has he a right to mine on or
under a public road without the permission of the
local municipality or body having the care and man-
agement of it (s).
A holder of a miner’s right can, however, take up a
claim as trustee for another person not holding one,
and can thereby confer an equitable interest in the
claim upon the cestui que trust ( t ).
The miner’s right is the authority or title deed by
virtue of which a claim is acquired as against the rest
of the public, and possession under it in conformity
with the by-laws gives the holder of the miner’s right
a title not only to the claim, but to all gold in and
upon that claim (u), and that whether the gold be in
the quartz or in the soil generally (v).

this important document, and these several privileges

Thus a miner’s right may be said to be more exten-
sive in the grant of powers and privileges under it
than a grant of the freehold of land, or what is
ordinarily known as a Crown Grant, and upon no other
condition than the payment to the Crown of a small
fee annually, and the renewal from time to time of the
miner’s right.
SECTION lI.—WHO MAY HOLD A MINER’S RIGHT.
The Mines Act enacts that a miner’s right shall be
granted to any person applying for the same on pay-
ment of the proper fee, and shall contain the Christian
name and surname and the residence of the person to
whom it is issued ( a ); and there appears to be no ex-
emption from the privilege.
A married woman may hold a miners’ right, and
may claim title under it, though it appears she cannot
maintain a suit for forfeiture before the Warden as a
feme sole (h).
As before stated separate miners’ rights are not re-
quired for both a trustee and his cestui que trust, it
being sufficient for all purposes if the trustee is the
holder of a miner’s right (c); and a cestui que trust
having no miner’s right may sue his trustee who holds

The same principle may be applied to the case of a
vendor and his purchaser (e); and to a mortgagor of
mining shares seeking redemption (/).
An incorporated company may hold a miner’s right
((/), and such company is entitled to a miner’s right in
its corporate name; it is not necessary for each indi-
vidual shareholder in the company to have one ( h ); or
a consolidated miner’s right in the name of the manager
or other trustee of the company for the proper number
of miner’s rights is sufficient for all purposes (i).
But it is absolutely necessary that a company hold
a sufficient number of miners’ rights, or a consoliated
miner’s right, for the number of men’s ground held in
the company’s claim, otherwise the title to the claim
will be defective and the rights of the company circum-
scribed (j), it being entirely foreign to the policy of
the Mines Act to permit a number of men’s ground
being taken up under an insufficient number of min rs’
rights.

holder of a miner’s right in force, and all that is re-
quired of him is that he shall hold and occupy his
claim in conformity with the by-laws of the mining
district or division in which the claim is situated {a).
Even if the certificate of registration of the claim is
not in the form required by the by-laws, occupation
under a miner’s right is not regarded as unathorized
occupation of Crown land, and a complaint for illegally
occupying Crown lands is sufficiently answered by a
defendant showing that he is in occupation under a
miner’s right, whether he be actually engaged in mining
or not (h).
Provided a claim is taken up and held in conformity
with the by-laws, occupation of it under a miner’s
right is paramount to every other right, except as
against the Queen (c); and the title of a person in
occupation of a claim under a miner’s right is not in
any way affected by an application for a gold mining
lease of the land occupied by him ( <1 ). But mere
possession of a claim under a miner’s right is not a
reservation or exception within the meaning of The
Transfer of Land Statute (e), and such possession is
no answer to an action of ejectment brought by the
holder of a certificate of title for the same land (/).
Any question of title as between a miner’s right and
a Crown grant or certificate of title will be sufficient
to oust the jurisdiction of the justices (g).

Termination of

Within the four corners of Part I. of the Mines
Act a title cannot be made by one miner’s right to more
than one claim or one man’s ground, unless otherwise
provided by the by-laws (h) ; but a by-law can lawfully
be made enabling the holder of one miner’s right to take
up several single men’s ground or claims under it with-
out requiring the duplication or multiplication of the
miner’s rights (i).
Of course as a miner’s right per se only gives title to
take up and occupy parcels of Crown lands, it does not
authorise mining for gold on private property. Pay-
ment is made for a miner’s right to work Crown lands
and Crown lands only (j). But now under certain
conditions the holder of a miner’s right may enter and
mine for gold on private property with the consent of
the owner (k).
A miner’s right must be renewed before the period
for which it is granted expires, and the dates of the
document and of its expiration are required to appear
on the face of the miner’s right (I). It is a title deed
for the claim held under it, but only during its cur-
rency, and becomes dead on the expiration of the term
(m); and if a claimholder ceases to hold a miner’s
right, or fails or neglects from any cause to renew it,
such neglect may be used in evidence of the abandon-
ment of the claim held by virtue of it ( n ).

right under which the defendant previously held the
claim,the miners right not having been renewed, ter-
minates the defendant’s title to the claim as against
the defendant (o). “ Claims to mine on Crown lands,”
says Molesworth, Chief Judge, “ are dependent for their
continuance or means of legal enforcement upon the
renewal of miners’ rights, but still are in the nature of
permanent estates, and are not confirmed by that which
is a means of renewal ” ( p). But qucere whether a title
under a miner’s right which is liable to forfeiture for
omission to renew the right is restored by a miner’s
right being taken out before adverse proceedings. If
vthe doctrine is pushed to the extremity that the title
is lost on an omission to keep up a continuous miner’s
right, a day’s delay or omission would be fatal to the
title ( q ).
In taking up ground under a miner’s right the miner’s
right need not at the time of its issue be appropriated
to any specific ground; and the holder of ground (r)
under a miner’s right which had expired was allowed
to appropriate to the same ground another miner’s
right which he held, and which he had not appropriated
before in order to save a forfeiture, although he might
not have intended so to appropriate it when the miner’s
right was taken out (s).
Though a person not being the holder of a miner’s
right is not authorized to take up and become possessed
of a claim, yet he may give a power of attorney to take
up ground in anticipation of having one ( t ).

only by voluntary abandonment de facto, or by those
breaches of conditions which amount to a constructive
abandonment or forfeiture (v).
SECTION IV.—MINER’S RIGHT AS A CONDITION
PRECEDENT TO SUE.
Ihe possession ot a miner’s right in force is a con-
dition precedent to the right of any person to institute
proceedings in any court or before the Warden to
recover possession of land occupied by virtue of a
miner’s right, or of any share in such land, or to
recover any damages for or to restrain the occupation
of or the encroachment upon such land, or any part
thereof, 01* to obtain any relief as tenant in common,
joint tenant, co-partner or co-adventurer in any such
land against his tenant in common, joint tenant, co-
partner or co-adventurer; and it is necessary that such
person shall have been the holder of a miner’s right,
or included in a consolidated miner’s right, at the time
when his alleged title to recover such possession or
damages, or to obtain such relief, first arose or accrued
(a).
A miner’s right is not a part of the plaintiffs’ title
as against the defendant so much as a condition as

Fleece andHealesCo., SA. J.R. 18.

to his capacity to obtain relief (h). And therefore it
is not necessary that a person seeking to enforce for-
feiture of a claim should have a miner’s right at the
time the forfeiture was incurred; it is sufficient if he
has one when the complaint is made (c). And where
under the Act No. 32 a plaintiff in equity held a
miner’s right at the time when his title to relief hist
arose, and also at the time of filing his bill, but had
during a portion of the interval been without one, it
was held that this was a sufficient compliance with
section 90 of that Act, which is in all respects identical
with section 246 of the Act No. 291 [No. 1120, section
298.] (d)
An applicant for certiorari to bring up a Warden’s
order ousting him from a claim need not have a
miner’s right, as it is not an application by him
to be put in possession of a claim (e) though the want
of a miner’s right would prevent him from acquiiing
the claim; and a mortgagor seeking redemption of
mining shares is not liable to the necessity of holding
a miner’s right (/) ; nor is a purchaser seeking speci-
fic performance of a contract for sale of a mining claim
(cj) ; though possession M‘ a miner’s right in force is
necessary in a suit in respect of a partnership at the
time the plaintiff’s title tb relief first accrued (h). But

f r mt who had no miner’s right could sue his trustee,

In case a claimholder allows his miner’s right to
expire and fails to renew it, the title to his claim is
tlieieby made voidable, and in a suit where possession
of a claim is sought on the ground that the defendant
had no miner’s right in force, the onus of proof will
be on the defendant to show that he had one in force
at the commencement of the suit (k).
The miner’s right on which a plaintiff relies as a
condition precedent to sue must be produced at the
hearing. The books of a mining registrar are not
e\ idence for the collateral purpose of showing that a
person taking up a claim had a miner’s right at the
time of the injury complained of, so as to enable him
to recover; though such books might be evidence to
show the existence of a miner’s right in such person
as Ins qualification for taking up the claim (I).

was held that the company holding more than two
men’s • ground had not a sufficient miner’s right to en-
able it to sue ( b ).
A company registered under The Mining Com-
panies Limited Liability Act, 1864 (c) was held entitled
to obtain a miner’s right in its corporate name, and it
was not necessary for each individual shareholder to
hold one (d) ; and it was held sufficient if each mem-
ber of an incorporated company held a miner’s right,
though the company had not one in its corporate name
(e). But in an application by a company and its man-
ager for an injunction, the production of a miner’s
right in the name of the manager only as trustee for
the company is not sufficient to entitle them to relief;
and the manager cannot in such a case apply in his
own name for an injunction (/).
A mining company can, however, sue for trespass if
holding a miner’s right at the time of the trespass in
respect of which relief is sought, though it may not
have had one at the time the trespass actually com-
menced (g). But where a company sued in the Court
of Mines to set aside the sale of a claim and machinery

SECTION VI.—CONSOLIDATED MINERS’ RIGHTS.
A consolidated miner’s right may he in force for
any number of years not exceeding fifteen, and may
be obtained on the application of the manager or any
trustee or trustees of any company of persons who
shall have agreed to work in partnership any regis-
tered claim or claims ; and when granted is in lieu of
and represents and is of the same force and effect as
a number of miners’ rights granted for the same period
of time equal to the number of miners’ rights by vir-
tue of which such claim or claims shall have been
originally taken possession of ( a).
A registered company may hold a consolidated min-
er’s right, either in its corporate name or in the name
of its manager (b) ; but a consolidated miner’s right
being for a corporation holding no land except by
trustees is not a consolidated miner’s right within the
meaning of the section (c) ; and a manager holding a
miner’s right in his own name as a trustee for a com-
pany which has no miner’s right cannot apply for an
injunction in his own name ( d ); and a consolidated
miner’s right held by a manager as trustee for a com-
pany applies only to companies having been or seek-

GOLD MUSING CLAIMS.

Sec, I.
Definition of
claim.
When first
applied.
SECTION I.—WHAT IS A CLAIM.
A mining claim is defined as “a piece of Crown land
which any person in accordance with any by-laws of
a mining board shall have taken possession of and be
entitled to occupy for the purpose of seeking for
therein, or any number of such parcels lawfully amal-
gamated by their owners”; but it does not include
land comprised in any lease for gold mining
{a) ; neither is a mining lease a claim within the mean-
ing of section 107 of The Criminal Law and Practice
Statute ( b ).
Though the word “claim” was applied to ground
held for mining purposes in the conditions of the for-
mer licenses to mine, the first application of it in the
mining code was in the Act 17 Vie. No. 4.
(a) Act No. 291 s. 2; and
see In re Glow exparte Hewitt ,
2 W. and W. (L.) 160.
(h) 27 Vic. No. 233. [Consol.
54 Vic. No. 1079 s. 108.] Reg.
v. Davies, 2 V.R. (E.) 117, 2 A.
J. R. 74.


A claim, possession of which is sought before the
Warden, need not necessarily comprise the whole
of the ground held by the person sought to be dis-
possessed. A claim is held (c) to mean what the land
would be called as to the taker, though it might be
part only of the claim or ground held by a previous
occupant ( cl ).
To constitute a place where mining operations are
carried on a “mine” under The Criminal Law and
Practice Statute there must be a shaft, or something
analagous to a shaft, but the distance from the shaft
to the spot where operations are actually carried on
makes no difference ( e ). This, however, refers to a
“mine,” which is a word of entirely different meaning
from a “claim.” The latter is the actual parcel of
ground taken up, with a view of subsequently becom-
ing a mine where shafts are sunk and works are
carried on. A claim, whether it be a frontage or a
block claim, subsists over the entire surface of the
ground (/), and even the proclamation by the Governor
of a road through a claim will not over-ride the title
of the claimholder (g).
SECTION lI.—FRONTAGE AND BLOCK CLAIMS.
There are only two kinds of claim known to the law,
viz. frontage and block claims. Every holder of a
block claim has equally with the holder of a frontage

claim a right to all gold within the boundary of that
claim, whether the gold be in the .soil generally or in
quartz (a). There is no difference between quartz and
alluvial block claims. A holder of a block claim
though registered only for a “block quartz claim” is
unrestricted in his rights as holder of a block claim
pure and simple (h).
The system of marking off' frontage claims came
originally from Ballarat, and was for a time found to
be very effective in developing new alluvial ground.
The primary idea of the system was simple, and it
answered a good purpose for a while as a means of
prospecting and tracing new leads. The method of
marking off frontage claims was defined by the regul-
ations of the local court of the district of Ballarat (c)
and was as followsA datum peg was fixed in a spot
immediately over the known position of the lead, and
from this peg radiating Hnes were laid out at such an
angle as to include the gutter or lead between them; The
o o
frontage claims, or length of gutter as allowed by the
by-laws, were bounded by concentric parallel lines
drawn from the central datum peg, and extending
from one radiating line to the other. In other min-
ing districts a plan was subsequently adopted of laying
down a right line along the supposed course of the lead,
and the longitudinal boundaries of the claims were laid
off' at right angles to such right line, instead of by the
concentric parallels. These lines or boundaries, called
the frontage parallels, embraced the claim, and the
owner of it could sink anywhere within the parallels
which formed his boundary. As soon as the gutter
was discovered within the claim the longitudinal or

side boundaries of the claim were narrowed down to a 1
size regulated by the by-law's, and the ground thus
narrowed became a permanent claim (d).
The frontage system, however, was subsequently ’
found to become very complex in the case of junction
of leads and returning leads, and was abolished at
Ballarat by by-law No. 111. of the district Mining
Board (e). The system, however, still exists in a
modified form in other mining districts of the colony,
and in all the districts where frontage by-laws are in
force the method has been adopted of marking off
longitudinal lines at right angles in lieu of the con-
centric parallels. The complexity of the system at
Ballarat gave rise to many almost interminable suits
on the equity side of the Supreme Court and in the
Court of the Chief Judge, and though for the most
part the elaborate judgments on the law of frontage
claims are of comparatively little value now the system
is almost obsolete, yet many of the points and ques-
tions decided by these courts are applicable to the
mining law of the present day.
A frontage claim embraces the whole surface be-
tween the parallels until it is narrowed down under
the by-laws. The claimholder is entitled not only to
the gold upon the lead in respect of which the claim
is registered, but to all gold within the parallels until
so narrowed ; and when narrowed, he is entitled to all
gold at whatever depth within the claim as narrowed

(/); and where a lead, after being worked through a
frontage claim, passes into an adjoining frontage claim
and then returns into the first claim, the holder of the
first claim is entitled to work it between his parallels (jj).
The holder of a frontage claim possesses a title to
the whole ground marked off, which enables him to
exclude from every portion of its area either before or
after it is narrowed persons who take up a block
claim within the parallels ( h) ; and the prohibition to
interference with a frontage claim on a lead undefined
will not apply to frontage claimants on other leads
intersecting, but their priority of title will depend on
the question which lead the gold is upon (i); and
moreover, registration of a frontage claim cannot be
effected on the undefined leads within the boundaries
of a frontage claim in which the course of the lead
has not been ascertained (j).
A claimholder cannot hold one piece of ground
under two distinct titles; he must either take a block
claim or a frontage claim ; and the holder of a front-
age claim taking up a block claim within his frontage
area forfeits his rights to that portion of his frontage

I block claim is a parcel of land that is marked out
defined metes and bounds, and taken up and regis-
-3d in accordance with the by-laws as a defined

depth of the lead. The depth or computed depth of
the lead on which the by-laws base the quantity of
land to be taken may, and in most cases must, be
assumed at the time of registration, and the depth so
assumed is conclusive (o); a claim cannot be enlarged
or restricted on discovery of a mistake. In a suit for
possession of land where the depth of the lead is as-
sumed a variance between the plaint and the plan an-
nexed to it is not fatal, but subjects the complainant
only to getting a smaller quantity of land as shown by
the plan (p), and does not invalidate the title altogether.
In some instances a claimholder is allowed to go be-
y ond the actual limits of the surface area of his claim.
Thus, where a local court regulation ( q ) provided that
the width of a claim should be 100 feet on each side
of the line of reef, and that the holders should be
entitled to the dips and angles of all reefs within the
boundary, and might follow them to whatever dis-
tance they might dip, it was held that the claimhold-
ers were entitled to hold spaces between the reef and
a line lunning parallel to its actual course, and were
also entitled to follow the dips and angles of the reef
connected with it, though beyond the 100 feet (r).

SECTION lII.—MINING BOARD BY-LAWS.
The mining boards were first instituted by the Act
No. 32, and were by that Act authorized to make by-
laws, which took the place of the former local court
regulations. Under The Mltivykj Stdtivte 1860 (No. 2 .) 1 )
[The Mines Act 1890, No 1120], which repealed the
Act No. 32, the mining boards are continued, and their
powers more definitely stated. 1 hey are empoveied
to make by-laws for their respective districts, or for
any division of a district, for any of the purposes set
forth in the several sub-sections of section 71. [No.
1120 sec. 106.]
It is necessary that the by-laws specify how the
boundary lines of claims are to be drawn, otherwise
they will be void for uncertainty (a), and they must
also fix the form of the claim (6).

In construing by-laws the courts will be guided by
the same rules as are applied to Acts of Parliament

title, he takes all the benefit of such former title as

his own, and loses the protection of his title previously
acquired, which will be deemed to be abandoned by
his taking the assignment of another title (b).
It is a most important principle of the mining
law that the holder of a miner’s right cannot, without
further warrant than entering on and marking out
land, seize or take possession of ground which was
previously occupied by another, or which is alleged to
have been forfeited or constructively abandoned by
the previous occupant. Before the holder of a miner’s
right can avail himself of a forfeiture or constructive
abandonment of a claim in the actual possession of
other miners, he is bound first to obtain the adjudica-
tion of the Warden on the subject (c); and the same
principle applies to persons seeking to deprive miners
in possession of too much ground ( d ).
the case of Critchley v. Graham was decided under
the former Goldfields Act («), but the principle is
upheld under the Act No. 291 [No. 1120], and is an
established principle of mining law (f). “The Act
No. 02, upon which Critchley v. Graham was decided,
embraces cases not merely of claims forfeited or
deemed to be abandoned, but cases of persons claiming
the possession of lands of which any other person has
possession or claims to occupy under the Act” (g).

But the principle of Gritchley v. Graham does not
apply to cases of actual abandonment (h), and will not
bar the holder of a miner’s right from taking posses-
sion as a claim of land the lease of which has expired
by effluxion of time (i) ; nor where a default has been
made in the application for a lease ( j) ; though the
principle will apply to a claim taken up under a
by-law which is ultra vires (Ic) ; and to persons in
actual occupation, though the possession be irregular
(I) ; and to a claim marked out previous to the
expiration of a mining lease of the same ground (m).
The renewal of the miner s right undei which a
claim is held is essential to the legal occupation of the
claim; for the right to mine, which originates in
possession, terminates with the cesser of use of the
land possessed (n), and termination of a miner’s right
without renewal terminates the title held under it (o).
Any Crown land unoccupied, or land occupied as a
claim if liable to forfeiture, may be occupied as Crown
land by any holder of a miner’s right {p) ; and a
holder of a miner’s right may take up a claim as
trustee for and confer an equitable interest in it upon
another person, even though such person does not
hold a miner’s right (q). A married woman is a

up a claim under it, sed qucere whether the claim
would not at once become the property of her
husband (r).
In taking’ up a claim it is absolutely necessary that
the by-laws be complied with in every particular (s)
and the claim so taken up must be occupied and
worked strictly in accordance with such by-laws. “In
this country mining claims may be taken up by
anybody without incurring any expense. When pub-
lic propei ty can be thus taken up, rules are necessary
to secure its proper use by those in possession of it,
and local bodies in different districts have been
empowered to make regulations as to the rights thus
acquired. Every person who takes up a claim in the
district knows, or is supposed to know, what are the
by-laws under which he will have to work it, and
must judge for himself whether it will be worth his
while to take it up ” ( t ).
Persons in actual possession have a good title by
their occupation as against trespassers, and can resist
a suit foi encroachment (u) j and possession alone is
sufficient evidence of title as against a mere wrong-
doer (y) ; and if a person purports to take up any
Crown land as a claim under his miner’s right,
although the ground so taken may have been pre-
viously applied to a public use, any other miner

SECTION V.—TITLE TO CLAIMS.
A claimholder is for all practical purposes possessed
f Ins claim for a permanent estate as regards the
üblic, and such estate is determinable only by volun-
rry abandonment de facto, or by those breaches of
onditions which amount to a constructive abandon-
ment or a forfeiture (a). Possession under a miner’s
ight in conformity with the by-&ws gives title to a
laim and to all gold in it (q) ; and that whether the
fold be in the quartz or in the soil generally The
niner’s right, under which a claim is held, is the
iitle deed to the claim, and the title thus acquired is
jompleted by registration as required by the bylaws,
md is based on possession ; a defendant in a suit
sannot set up a title not duly registered at the time of
the trial (d). .4 H -V* ''
The holder of a claim (e) is the person registered
for the claim in the books of the mining registrar (/).
But mere registration alone will not give a title. The

deemed a sufficient title to it for the purpose, but
where the evidence of title to a claim is a recent
transfer, it will require to be supported by showing
the title of the transferror or something else (g).
As regards the Crown the interest which the
of a miner’s right has in his claim is at the utmost an
estate at will, terminable by exemption of the land
from occupation for mining purposes at any time, and
for such an estate an action of ejectment cannot be
brought in the Supreme Court (h). And the words
“ interest in any claim,” in the proviso to section 73
of the Act No. 291, do not include the right to com-
pensation for improvements on eviction (i).
A share or interest in a claim may be assigned to a
person not holding a miner’s right if the miner’s right
appropriated to the share or interest be assigned with
it ( j). And a person having a share or interest in a
claim with others cannot be excluded from such share
or interest by his partners without his consent.
Where the owners of a claim, excluding one of them,
affected to deal with the claim in forming a new
company, though the excluded partner has no right
to shares in the new company he may enforce his title
to his share or interest in the claim (A;).
Under the Act No. 291 [No. 1120 Part I] the holder
of a miner’s right cannot take up and hold more than

one man’s ground as a claim. One person is not
allowed to multiply himself or his powers by multi-
plying his miner’s right unless the by-laws expressly
enact that multiplied miners’ rights should give power
to take up multiplied quantities; and thus one person
cannot by obtaining live miners’ rights in Ins own
name take up and retain possession of live men’s
ground (I). But a by daw empowering the holder of
one miner’s right to take up several men’s ground
under it is not ultra vires (m); and under a by-law
permitting one man holding a miner’s right to hold
not more than fifty men’s ground a holder of a miners
right may take up, or become the transferee of, claims
not exceeding fifty men’s ground (n). So, after
claims have been taken up and registered, the several
miner’s rights under which the claims are taken up
may be transferred to a purchaser for several part-
ners (o).
When two adverse persons are in possession of the
same claim the law accords possession to him who
has the title (p) ; and where persons are in actual
occupation of ground, though the occupation may not
be strictly legal or regular, other persons have no
riolit to come in upon them and disturb such posses-
sion but can only take advantage of any defect in the
title by proceeding before the Warden or in the Court
of Mines ( q ).

miner’s right is restored by one being taken out
before any adverse proceedings ; but a title could be
defeated by a registration during the period of
omission (r).
The courts will jealously guard the rights and
,interests of litigants coming before them, and a claim-
holder whose title is the subject of litigation will not
be allowed to retain the proceeds of his claim pending
litigation. Where the title to auriferous land is in
"dispute the gold should be retained till the rights of
the parties have been ascertained, no practical injury
being inflicted on either side, the mine being worked
under restrictions, so as to ensure that the balance
after deducting the necessary expenses being placed
in a bank should be available to either plaintiffs or
defendants, whichever might be ultimately held
entitled to it ( s ).
SECTION VI.—AMALGAMATION OF CLAIMS.
The amalgamation of claims is contemplated and
authorised by section 4 of The Mining Statute [No.'
1120 sec. 4] in cases where adjoining claimholders
have agreed to work in partnership. It is the usual*
practice to amalgamate small adjoining claims where
the depth of working is such that the separate claim-
holders would be at great expense in working a
number of small claims, in cases where the ground
could be more profitably and more expeditiously
worked as a single claim.

Co., 8 Y.L.R. (E.) 120, 3 A.L.T.
125. 4 A.L.T. 21.


The. title to the several claims must be good before
the amalgamation, and the amalgamation of a claim
liable to forfeiture with other ground legally held will
not cure the forfeiture (a) ; nor will subsequent work-
ing of the claim cure a forfeiture previously incurred
(5) • for where amalgamation is effectual for all
purposes of working it is also effectual for all
liabilities for not working, and all excuses for not
working (c).
In a case under the Beechworth by-laws (d) where
a party took up four adjoining claims by erecting
four posts only, one at each angle of the ground taken
up, and registered each claim separately, and after -
wards registered them as one amalgamated claim, it
was held that they should in the first instance have
marked off each claim separately as a distinct claim,
and that they had not priority over persons who had
properly marked them out ( e ) ; and it was subse-
quently held under the same by-laws that several
persons taking up ground of dimensions to which they
are jointly entitled may take possession effectually by
pegging and trenching the entire and not the separate
single men’s ground (/). The distinction between the
two cases is apparent. In the latter case the ground
was marked out and taken up as one amalgamated
claim by a party of miners, whereas in Holt v. Pratt
separate claims were registered by each individual
without being individually marked out.

What land is

In the ease of The Parade G.M. Co. v. The Victoria
United, Co. (ff) it was held that if an amalgamation of
• claims were irregular it had the effect of throwing the
owners back on their original titles under their single
claims, and reviving the rights under the claims prior
to amalgamation ; this decision, however, was in an
interlocutory application, and was reversed in the case
of Donaldson v. Llanberis Co. (h), where it was decided
that where an amalgamated claim had been re-
registered the previous separate titles to the claims
amalgamated could not be relied on (i).
Amalgamation of claims unites them as to work
upon one of them saving a forfeiture of the others, but
not as to making a trespass upon one a trespass upon
a ll (j) 5 it gives important new rights, especially
the preserving from forfeiture of any part by working
on other parts (/.'); for immediately on amalgamation
the several amalgamated claims previously held
separately become one single claim, which is then
worked as a single claim, and is subject to the same
liabilities, as it is entitled to the same privileges, as if
such amalgamated claim had been originally taken up
as a single claim.

power under section 14 [l7] to except from such
occupation any specific portion or class of Crown
ands.
Thus, land reserved for a public use or purpose
cannot be taken up as a claim, though where land
was only reserved for sale and was not dedicated to
any specific purpose ( a ) it was not thereby taken out of
the operation of The Mining Statute, and the title of
miners in occupation of it was not invalidated (6).
Reservation to a public use or purpose is sufficient
to exempt land from occupation under miner’s right,
without the necessity of improvements being effected
on it, and land reserved for a park need not neces-
sarily be enclosed for the purpose of dedication to the
use of the public, any more than a road must neces-
sarily be fenced in and metalled to be a road (e) ; and
permissive occupancy, granted by the Governor-in-
Council, of land “to be Used for recreation and
gymnastic purposes,” was heM under the Act No. 82,
sec. 4, to be a sufficient reservation or application to a
public purpose of the land, sp as to prevent it being
taken up as a claim ( d ).

from further occupation under miner’s right, and then
use the land without regard to the rights of the

quite sufficient for this purpose, as to the commence-
ment and continuance of mining; “ for a claimholder
might hold for ever, in spite of the greatest public
inconvenience, land wanted for public purposes, unless
some words were found in the Act authorising the
Crown to terminate his interest in the claim ” ( e ).

It was held in the case of The Parade G.M.JAo. v.
The Royal Harry Q.M. Co. (/) that the subsoil of
Crown lands applied to any public purpose, or held
under miner’s right or business or other license (as
contradistinguished from a lease) plight be within the
limits of a claim, and unless excepted by the Governor-
in-Council might be mined upon, so long as the surface
rights were not interfered with; but The Residence
Areas Act (g), validating gold mining leases below the
surface of residence areas, prohibits any person not
being the holder of a lease from mining thereunder,
and consequently such area could not be included
(either oir or below the surface) in a claim held under
miner’s right (h).

The restriction in The Land Act 1869 (j) against re-
moving soil from Crown lands applies to searching for

has always been there in situ, and not that which by
human means may have been deposited there, such as
quartz tailings or mullock (/<■)•
(h) Public Highways.
The Act No. 291 [No. 1120 Part I.] authorises the
holder of a miner’s right or of a mining lease to mine
upon or under any street, road, or highway, on certain
conditions as to prevention of injury to property, or
obstruction to the highway, and provides for a permit
being issued for the purpose by the body having the
care and management of the highway (a). A street
or road cannot, however, be taken up as a claim under
the by-laws, and the Warden has no jurisdiction to
adjudicate on a summons seeking a declaration o
forfeiture and to be put in possession of it (b). But
land must be legally made and proclaimed a road
before it is so excepted from occupation as a claim (c).
The Court of Mines, however, has to
grant an injunction by one party of miners, mining

■ interfering with them, although the land mined upon
could not be held under miner’s right as a claim ( d ),
on the principle that the 1 earliest in possession is
entitled to protection against a mere wrongdoer.
A permit to mine under streets or roads given by a
municipal council does not merely remove obstruc-
tions to acquiring title, but confers privileges
unconnected with any other title, and does away with
the necessity of applying for the ground or registering
it under the by-laws, and such title is good, except as
against the real owner (e); but a permit to mine is
not to be relied on as conferring title, it is simply a
privilege granted by the clemency of the governing
body, and no guarantee of title (/).
A municipal council has no option of either granting
or refusing an application to mine on a road under its
control. It must consider the application, and cannot
simply decline to entertain it. The words of the Act
are emphatic—the council “ shall decide whether the
same ( i.e. mining upon or under streets or roads) can
be effected without injury ” (g). Their decision, how-
ever, should not be made without due consideration of
the probable effects of mining on the surface of roads,
for a council which has granted permission to mine
upon public streets is not absolved from the respon-
sibility cast upon it as managers to take care that the

streets are preserved in good order (h). Therefore if
subsidence occurs in a road through mining, it is tbe
duty ot‘ the council as between it and the public to
repair and make good the road, the question of damage
being left as an individual matter between the council
and the person causing the injury.
Reservation of a road is not a reservation of the soil
underneath it. but merely the right of passing over it (i).
The surface of a road is under the control of the mum-
Idpal body, the land of all roads being vested in the
>own ( j ); and the Council has no control over the sod
under a road. Public streets are not usually allowed
bo be occupied for mining purposes, but where the local
body sees no objection to sjich occupation and grants
a permit, sections 15 and 10 of the Act No. 291 [No.
1120, secs. 18, 19] provide for occupation of exempted
or excepted land with the approbation of the Go-
vernor-in-Council (k). j
A Crown grant referring! to a road and accompanied
with user is sufficient evidence that the road has been
dedicated to the public usel(i) ; but cutting through a
track outside a claim for the purpose of making a tad
race, and altering the track, which altered track was
afterwards used by the public, does not by per-
missive user alone constitute a dedication to the

A creek which has been reserved for public purposes,
and which has been taken ujnder the management of
a municipal council, and which has been used by such
council, is similar to a road, the control of which is
vested in such council, and cannot be taken up and
worked as a claim without the?permission of the council
(n).
If land is a properly dedicated street or road miners
have no right to disturb or injure it, and on a com-
plaint before justices against such miners for disturb-
ing the soil of the street, the occupation of the miners
cannot be put forward to oust the jurisdiction of the
justices on the ground that a question of title is
involved (o).
It has been held in several cases that the owner of
land abutting on a public street or road was owner

SECTION VIII.—THE EFFECT OF MARKING OUT A CLAIM
FOR A MINING LEASE.
A claimholder may apply for a gold mining lease
of his claim, in which case the obtaining of the lease
is an abandonment of his title under miner’s right.
If a person has a claim and applies for a lease of it, he
is subject until the lease is granted to the forfeiture
of his claim if he does not comply with the conditions
to which the claim is subject (a), and the application
for a lease cannot be set up is an excuse for breach of
the by-laws, though immediately on the granting of
the lease the miner’s right title will merge in the lease
title, and any forfeiture accruing under the former
title will be cured by the latter title.
'A title to a claim held under miner’s right is good
against an applicant for a lease. The claimholder
'is not bound to resist the granting of the lease by
objecting to it under the leasing regulations, but he
may do so ; and should such a lease be granted he can
protect himself against the lease by showing his
lawful title (b).
But ground subject of an application for a lease
may not be marked out as a claim. The Act 36 Vic-
No. 446, secs. 3 and 4 [No. 1120, secs. 70, 71] prohibits
all means of acquiring a claim pending an application
for a lease of the same ground, and therefore the
holder of a miner’s right has no right to mark out as
a claim ground the subject of an application for a
lease, and the Warden cannot put him in possession
pending the application (c) ; neither can the Warden
declare a claim forfeited pending an application foi a

lease of the same ground by the claimholder, unless
_ default in compliance with the leasing regulations be
shown; but if a complaint seeking forfeiture be
brought before him, the temporary obstruction of the
marking out for the lease is a ground for adjournment
from time to time until the application for the lease is
disposed of ( d ). If the lease, be granted, the lessee
will take his title under it; if the lease be refused-,
the Warden can then adjudicate on the complaint for
forfeiture. But a lease, if obtained, will not be
effectual against a person lawfully entitled and in
occupation under a miner’s right previous to the
application for the lease (e).
However, this subject, i.e., the rights of a claim-
holder as against an applicant for a lease, and the
rights of an applicant for a lease to immunity pending
his application as against the holders of miners’ rights,
will be more fully discussed in a subsequent portion
of this work, dealing with interests in gold mining
leases (/).

'Jr ■ SECTION IX.—SUBSIDIARY CLAIMS.
In addition to the mining claims before mentioned
the by-laws of all the districts provide for what may
be called subsidiary claims, such as prospecting claims,
creek claims, sluicing claims, bank sluicing claims,
machine areas, tunnelling claims, dam sites, etc., all of
which are a species of block claim, as the area taken
up is defined by metes and bounds in the same
manner as an ordinary block claim.

(/) See post, Bk. 11. “ Inter-
ests in Gold Mining Leases.’’


Most of the by-laws admit of extended claims
taken up on old worked ground, the title to which is
the same as that of a block claim, a slight difference
being made in the form of application.
Areas for the erection of machinery are also taken
up under the by-laws. A person holding a machine
area or a dam site has no right to mine on it, as it is
held for a special purpose. and not as an ordinary
mining claim. If he mines on such area he has no
title to the gold in it, and he cannot claim title to a
reef that passes through such area, his only title
being that of unlawful occupation of the ground as a
mining claim. The holdei of an adjoining claim fol-
lowing the dips and angles of a reef passing through
a machine area ( ct ) was field to be in constiuctive
possession of the gold in si ch area (6).
Prospecting claims taken up at a certain dis-
tance (fixed by the the locality of any
other gold workings, and enlarged areas are granted,
to be occupied provisionally as a prospecting area
until the discovery of payable gold therein, after
which the area is reduced to that of an ordinary
claim.
Creek claims are those which include the bed of a
creek or river, and are limited by the by-laws to a
certain length in the direction of the course of tlie
stream, and to ascertain width. TCc urUtL
An ordinary sluicing claim is a form of block claim
taken up in any portion of the district to be worked

privileges. A large area is usually granted for
sluicing claims.
Bank sluicing claims are those which do not include
the bed of a creek or river, biut include the ground on
either side of it, and extend a certain distance along
the course of the creek or Tver by a certain width
regulated by the by-laws.
Tunnelling claims are block claims taken with a
view to work from tunnels instead of shafts, and the
ground from the mouth of the tunnel to the face is
frequently outside the boundaries of the claim alto-
gether, the tunnel itself being merely an easement to
the claim.
Machine areas for the erection of puddling or crush-
ing plants, etc., and dam sites and water privileges
are also easements to the mining claims to which they
are appurtenant.
The by-lqws regulating these subsidiary claims differ
more or less in each of the mining districts according
as circumstances may require and in this respect the
by-laws of each district are a ( law to the district
itself.


CHAPTER HI.
THE MEANS BY WHICH INTERESTS IN CLAIMS
MAY BE ACQUIRED.
SECTION I.—BY MARKING OUT.
The various mining boards have power to make i
by-laws, to be in force in their respective districts, for
prescribing the manner in which claims shall be taken
possession of («), and marking out or pegging has in
the various by-laws been made the first proceeding by
any one desirous of acquiring a claim (6).
As before stated (c), possession in conformity with
the by-laws is sufficient to give the holder of a miner’s
right a title to the claim marked out and taken up by
him, and to all gold found in or upon that claim (cl),
but it is absolutely necessary in taking possession of
a claim that the requirements of the by-laws be com-
plied with. And the by-laws will always be construed

strictly (e), and according to the rules which courts of
justice have applied to the construction of Acts of
Parliament (/).
The basis of title to a claim is possession ( g ), and
the first act of possession, either with respect to virgin
ground or to land which has been abandoned de facto,
is the marking out in conformity with the by-laws.
“ The title to mine on the Crown lands of Victoria,”
says Moles worth, Chief Judge, “from their being first
let open to miners has been based on possession, the
first person taking such possession under restrictions
imposed being held to have the best right ” (A); and
persons first marking off a claim which is actually
abandoned, and applying for registration, are entitled
in preference to all others, even to one who after-
wards obtained a declaration by the Warden of
forfeiture by the original holders (i).
Non-compliance with the by-laws, however, in the
taking up of a claim will not make such taking up
void, but only voidable, and an adjudication of poses-
sion by the Warden is necessary to give title as
against a person taking up a claim irregularly and
being in unlawful occupation of it ( j ).
(a) Manner of Marking Out.
The mode of marking out a claim is always defined
by the by-laws, and the urdiversal method adopted is
by inserting posts or pegs i,t the angles of the claim,
or on the approximate base line of a reef, or both,
before applying for registration.

(i) Keast v. D’Angri, 4 A.J.R.
61.
(j) Oreenhill v. Braidley, 4 V.
L.R. (M.) 5.


If a by-law requires a claim to be marked out by
erecting posts at the angles, the claim can be taken
up in no other manner. Where a by-law (a) provided
that claims should be taken possession of by erecting
a post at each corner of the claim, such post to be not
less than three inches in diameter, and to be fixed
firmly in the ground, extending at least three feet
above it, it was held that thb by-law was reasonable
under section 111 of the Act No. 32 (6), and where a
miner had taken possessiorj of a claim under this
by-law by erecting two posts ' at one boundary, blazing
a tree at another, and adopting the stump of a tree
as a post at another, it was hejld that the marking out
was bad, and that the non-coifipliance with the by-law
avoided the effect of taking \ possession, and that a
claim could lawfully be taken possession of only by
erecting posts and in the places, and of the dimensions
and height mentioned in the byelaw (c).
If a by-law requires pegs to be fixed at the corners
of a claim, and two of such corners are on a highway,
the fixing of the pegs on the highway may be an
illegal act so far as encroaching on the highway is
concerned, yet as regards the claim the applicant can
effectually take it up by so marking it out (d) ; and
where a miner taking up a claim (e) found that he
could not peg it out in compliance with the by-laws
without trespassing upon private property, it was
held that as he had not fixed his pegs on the private
property he acquired no title to the claim under the

• by-law, though the taking up was sufficient to enable
him to be sued for being in illegal occupation (/).
Pegging out a claim afresh is an abandonment of
title acquired by a previous marking out; a claim-
holder cannot hold under two titles, and it will be
assumed that by a second marking he is not satisfied
with the regularity of the first marking, and so
voluntarily abandons it (g).
As marking and registration in accordance with the
by-laws are a condition precedent to an applicant
obtaining a title to a claim, a person obtaining a
Warden’s order putting him in possession of a for-
feited or abandoned claim must mark out such claim
forthwith in the same manner as he would be required
to do upon taking up a new claim ( h ), unless the
by-laws specially provide that such marking out is
unnecessary ( i). Marking lout a claim alleged to be
forfeited cannot, howevei, be effected before the
Warden’s adjudication, as any entry on the claim for
the purpose would constithte a trespass as against
the registered holder of the claim. But re-pegging is
not necessary in the case of a person taking a transfer
of a good title. Any marking out in such a case
would create a fresh title, aAd constitute an abandon-
ment of the previous title transferred ( j ).

dimensions to which they sire jointly entitled, with a
view to the subsequent amalgamation of such claims,

may take possession effectually ( k) by pegging and
Drenching the corners of the entire block, and not the
separate single men’s portior s, and may then register
the whole as an amalgamated claim (I). In this case
the amalgamation was virtually effected before the
pegging out and the claims vere not applied for and
registered separately, and s( the decision is not in
conflict with that in Holt v. Pratt (m), where a num-
ber of persons marked out th 3 entire ground to which
they were jointly entitled as a single claim, and
registered their single claims separately, and then
registered an amalgamated c aim without re-pegging.
The title to the amalgamated claim thus acquired was
held to be defective (n).
On a re-pegging the whole claim must be marked
out afresh. A by-law (o) required a claim to be taken
up by fixing four pegs, one at each corner. The
defendants marked out an alluvial claim which ex-
ceeded the quantity to which they were entitled, but
was otherwise regular so far as the pegging out was
concerned; but they had no miners rights at the time
they so marked out. Subsequently, having obtained
miners’ rights, they again marked out their claim, not
by fixing four pegs as required by the by-law, but by
retaining two of the original pegs and by altering the
other two. The Chief Judge held that this was not a
good marking out, inasmuch as the alteration of one
boundary of their ground was not a constructive
taking possession of a claim under their miners
rights ( p).

Truswell v.

The onus of proving that ground has been properly
marked out in the manner prescribed by the by-laws
always rests with the person defending his title ( q ).
(h) Priority of Marking Out.
It is an established principle that the person who
first marks off a claim is entitled to it in preference to
all others (a). But a person marking out ground in
the occupation of another, or ground that has been
constructively abandoned, has no priority over the
original holder until he has obtained an ajJjjjdi^atjon_
of the Warden in his favor (F) ; and! a/third person
cannot take up as a claim land which is the subject of
a complaint for forfeiture before the Warden pending
the answer of the Chief Judge [Supreme Court] (c)
on a special case (d), or pending the application for a
mining lease of the saipd ground (e), as the inchoate
right of the holdei/should not be defeated by a
stranger during thht time.
The effect of priority of marking out as giving
priority of title is fully demonstrated in the case of
Truswell v. Powning (/), known locally as the Little
Bendigo jump. In that case Millett, representing the
Temperance Co., was the holder of a claim at Little
Bendigo, near Ballarat, and Powning issued a War-
den’s summons returnable at 10 a.m. on November 1
against Millett, seeking •to be put in possession of

certain land held by Millett in excess of that allowed
by the by-laws. On the day on which the summons
was returnable (Nov. 1) Truswell, without the consent
of Millett, marked out the land in question as a claim
at 2.80 o’clock in the morning, and at ten o’clock of
the same day registered his claim with the mining
registrar. On the same day, at 11 a.m., the Warden
made an order for possession as against Millett in
favor of Powning. Powning, however, abandoned
the order thus obtained from the Warden, as such
order enured to him only as against Millett and not as
against others, and at 11.80 a.m. lie, with the consent
of the Temperance Co. (as represented by Millett),
marked out a claim on the disputed land and obtained
possession, not as under the Warden’s order, nor as a
transfer from Millet, but as an entirely new taking
up. Truswell, who had pegged out the land earlier in
the morning, and who had registered himself for the
claim, summoned Powning before the Warden for
trespass, and for an order for his removal from the
land. On special case stated, it was held that r l rus-
well being the first to mark out the ground was
entitled to succeed as against Powning ; that Powning
by re-pegging had abandoned his previous title ob-
tained from the Warden, and had committed a trespass
as against Truswell by entering on and marking out
the claim ; and that he could not set up the title of
Millett (the Temperance Co.), or his own possession
with the consent of the company, as a title by way of
possession as against Truswell. In re Drummond
exparte Dunbar (g), Hunter v. Aratraveldt (h), and
Flinn v. Kilgour ( i ) are quoted in the judgment.

sometimes happens, however, that a claimholder deem-
ing his title unsound re-marks and re-registers his
claim, without regard to the effect of such a proceed-
ing. A claim may be lost by excess of caution.
Thus, Clarke on April 28, 1868, pegged out and
registered under the Beech worth By-laws an ordinary
quartz claim. On May 18, and again on. May 26 he
registered a quartz tunnelling claim, the boundaries of
which included the quartz claim originally marked
out by him. There was no provision in the by-
laws for taking up and registering a quartz tunnel-
ling claim, eo nomine. On discovery of this, and
deeming his title insecure, Clarke re-pegged the ori-
ginal quartz claim on Sept. 9, but failed to follow up
his pegging by registration. On Sept. 25 Clarke
applied for a lease of the whole ground, and on
November 5 O’Sullivan summoned Clarke before the
Warden, seeking a declaration of forfeiture and an
order for possession of the claim. On special case, the
Chief Judge held that each successive registration
by Clarke constituted an abandonment of his pre-
vious title; that the re-pegging of his original claim
on Sept. 9, not having been followed by registration,
did not redeem or revi|fe his title to the claim ; and
that his application for a lease afforded no protection
to nor alteration in any previous title (j).

under miner’s right, though in the event of the lease 1
being granted, the lessee could proceed for encroach-
ment and for restitution of the gold taken out of the
leased land ( b ). But under section 3 of the above
Act [No. 1120, sec. 70] “pending the application for .
a lease it shall not be lawful to mark out as a claim,
or to include within the boundaries of any claim,
the land applied for, or any part thereof, and no
such marking out shall confer any right or title to
the said land ” (c).
However, land formerly held under a lease which
has expired by effluxion of time may be marked out
and applied for as a claim, and that without the
necessity of an adjudication by the Warden (d) ; as
also after the Crown has recovered possession and
declared a lease void (e) ; or if a default shall have
been made in the applicai ion (f); but not land the
lease of which is merely alleged to be void (<j) ; nor
can land be legally marked out prior to the expiry
of a lease in anticipation of the expiration of the
term (/<-); though marking out a claim on the even-
ing of the day on which the Gazette notice of for-
feiture of a lease of the lahd marked out is published
is a good marking out (i). ,

section 37 of the Act No. 291 [No. 1120, sec. 65]
explaining section 24 [49] made leases valid as
against persons taking up claims after the applica-
tion and before the granting of leases, hut that it
made them valid against such persons only when
the application for the lease was made in accord-
ance with the leasing regulations ( k).
Though the holder of a miner’s right has no
means of acquiring a claim pending application for
a lease, he may during that period proceed before
the Warden to be put in possession of the land
subject to the fate of the (application for the lease
(I) ; and taking possession of a claim by marking
out is good as against a person subsequently mark-
ing out the ground as for a lease, even though the
registration of the claim is effected subsequently to
the marking out for the lease (m).
Under the Act No. 291, secs. 24 and 37 [No.
1120, secs. 49 and 65], marking out for a lease did
not, as already shown, stop the power of acquiring
title to a claim by marking, except as to the rights
of those previously marking for a lease (n), but the

SECTION lI.—BY ADJUDICATION OF THE WARDEN.
It has been already shown that on the principle of
Oritchley v. Graham, before a miner can avail himself
of a forfeiture or a constructive abandonment of a
claim in the actual possession of another miner, he
must first obtain from the Warden a declaration of
forfeiture or abandonment, and an order to be put in
possession. This principle does not apply, however,
to intentional or de facto abandonment.
The Warden has jurisdiction to order possession of
a claim to be given to any holder of a miner’s right if
the claim has been constructively abandoned (a), or
forfeited for non-compliance with the by-laws (h), or
if the defendant is in illegal occupation (c) ; and in a
complaint before the Warden for recovery of posses-

But the Warden’s order of forfeiture alone is not
sufficient to give the complainant a title. The order
of forfeiture merely clears away the old titles, and
authorises possession by the complainant under his
miner’s right. Persons obtaining a Warden’s order
must therefore mark out the claim as upon taking up
new ground, and they are not necessarily entitled to
take up the whole of the ground forfeited unless they
have sufficient miners’ rights (e) ; but/ where the
by-laws provide that irikrking out subsequent to the
adjudication is not necessary it need nga be done (/),
though in ordinary cases marking out and registration
on the adjudication of possession by the Warden are
necessary to give priority of title (g).
Marking out a claim is not a necessary preliminary
to proceeding before the Warden for forfeiture and
possession (h). There must be some legal means to
enable a complainant to enforce the right of all miners,
and requiring him to make a preliminary marking out
of the claim of which he sought possession would be
requiring a preliminary which would be a trespass
upon possession if he proved wrong (i).
A collusive recovery of land before the Warden
will not give a valid title, and even a large expendi-
ture on a claim by holders previous to forfeiture will

Under the Act No. 32 a by-law (k) was held ultra
vires, which directed that the value of defendant’s
material then on the ground should be paid for before
a complainant could take possession, and it was fur-
ther held that such by-law! was not made valid by
section 80 of the Act No. 291 preserving existing
interests. But where under this by-law Jacomb took
up a claim on January 16, 1885, and on February 27,
1872, Hartmann obtained an adjudication of forfeiture
from the Warden, who directed possession to be given
to him on payment of the value of the defendant’s
material, and Hartmann took possession without pay-
ing the money, marked off the claim, and obtained
registration of it, it was held that though the by-law
was ultra vires Hartmann could not take possession
of the ground without paying the money, until the
bad part of the order requiring the money to be paid
had been quashed (I). 1

required to be given to the mi ping registrar, who will
then furnish a certificate of the application. The

the locality in which the land lies, and a notice to
take up a claim (a) signed by one of the intending
claimholders for himself and nineteen others was held
to be bad, and to make the title to the claim bad (h).
In an application for registration of a claim a mis-
take as to the time of taking possession may be
explained by evidence of the real facts. Thus, where
an applicant made a mistake in his application by
inserting “p.m.” (post meridiem) in lieu of “a.m.” (ante
meridiem), it was held that such a mistake could
not be taken advantage of by an applicant for a
mining lease of the ground ; though the Chief Judge
doubted the effect of such a mistake as between
holders of miners’ rights both applying for a claim
under the by-laws (c). And so, where a mistake was
made in the area taken up. Where a claim was pro-
perty marked out with an area of 16 acres, but was
described in the notice of application without fraud
as 12 acres, and the survey under the by-laws showed
the correct area to be 16 acres, and the applicants
had sufficient miners’ rights to justify them in taking
up that quantity of ground, it was held that they
acquired a good title to the whole 16 acres (d).
A verbal application to the mining registrar to
re-register an amalgamated claim (e) made by the
manager of an incorporated cc mpany, with the con-
sent of the other parties interested, was held to be a

quires marking out as a condition precedent to
acquiring title to acclaim, that preliminary being
prescribed by the ; but it is otherwise with
regard to registration, ambbeforc availing himself of
the privileges of sectioH w *dNo. 1120, sec. 8] it is
necessary that a claimholder>shall register his claim
in pursuance of section b [7| The mode of registra-
tion is defined by the by laws-. I\).&
r, t \b
Registration, however, is not necessary to complete
a title as against trespassers ; it is entirely optional.
And where a by-law (a) Authorised the taking up of
unregistered claims, it wa 5 held that marking out the
claim without actual possession would enable the
owner to maintain tresj ass, though he could not
maintain ejectment (6).
The question of registration of claims does not
apply as between a person 1 marking for a lease and a
person marking for a claim, though it would apply as
between persons marking for claims. A total omis-
sion to register would be iipmaterial as to the former
parties. As between convicting claimholders the
material obligation of working an unregistered claim
runs from the time of taking up, and for this purpose
parts of a day are to be considered (c). “ I have some
difficulty,” says Molesworth, Chief Judge, “as to
whether registration in the name and within the time
prescribed by the by-laws is a condition precedent to
title. I would rather say that a defendant cannot set

A possessory title without registration, though it
may be good as against trespassers, must, however, be
unsatisfactory. The holder ctf a claim (e) means the
registered holder, and persons not registered cannot
avail themselves of the by-law (/) ; and where regis-
tration is required, registration within the time pre-
scribed by the by-laws is part and parcel of the title,
as that is the time from which the obligation to work
a registered claim begins (#).
. The certificate of registration of a claim is granted
oy the mining registrar. It is not necessary that the
certificate of registration should contain the name of a
company which was only a partnership and not incor-
porated, in addition to the names of its members (ft) ;
and it seems that a survey and plan are not necessary
to complete the final registration of a claim, though
where a by-law makes a survey and plan a condition
precedent to registration, neglect to comply with the
by-law in this respect will render the claim liable to
forfeiture (i). If a survey is required the surveyor
Cannot elect whether or not to make it. His duty is
purely ministerial, and the Supreme Court will if
necessary grant a mandamus to compel him to make
a survey (j).

defeat title, but only enable; prior registration by

up under the Beechworth by-laws (m) by Oxley and .
others, who worked continuously from the taking up
on the 9th of the month, add registered the claim on
the 14th, omitting to register the claim within two
days as required (n), the Chief Judge held that such
omission did not avoid tic taking possession by
marking out. “Coupling The Mining Statute 1865,
secs. 5,6, 7, and 71 (xiii.), [TNo. 1120, secs. 5,7, 8, and
106 (xiii.)], with the language of the by-law, I think
the omission would only de irive Oxley and his part-
ners of the powers of secs. 6 and 7 [7 and 8] until
registration, and subject them to a pecuniary penalty
under section 237 ” [No. 112 J), sec. 289] (o).
A claim cannot be registered unless the miner’s
right or miners’ rights under which it is held be pro-
duced at the time to the mining registrar (p) ; and it
is not necessary to appropriate a miner’s right at the
time of its issue to any specific ground (q).
The books of the mining registrar, or copies certified
by him, are evidence of the registration of a claim (r),
and are also evidence to show the existence of miner’s
rights in the persons taking up the claim as their
qualification for taking it up, though such evidence
I would be insufficient to show their right to sue under
section 246 [29B]. In the latter case the miners’
} rights must be produced (s).

order.
Re-marking.
When the Warden declares ground forfeited and
orders possession to be given to a complainant, this
alone does not excuse compliance with the by-laws ;
the complainant should mark out and register himself
for the claim in the same manner as if it were virgin
ground taken up by him under his miner’s right.
The Warden’s order only decides that the land is open
for selection. It declares that the ground has been
forfeited by the defendant; it removes the existing
interests, and the complainant then takes the land
itself which is unoccupied, and occupies it by virtue
of his miner’s right, first marking, applying for, and
registering it under the by-laws ( t). But where a
by-law prescribes registration forthwith after adjudi-
cation of possession by tin Warden, marking out is
not necessary. If the ho der of a claim registered
without marking under a i order of forfeiture en-
croached upon the claim of mother person it might be
a cloud upon his title, but clmld not defeat it (u).
Re-marking without registration has no effect on
the title ( v ). This will amount to an abandon-
ment within the meaning of Barkers G.M. Co. v.
Keating (w), as it is a nullity ; registration being a
subsequent proceeding and a completion of title after
marking, a person re-marking only and not re-
registering does not abandon his registration already
effected.

declaration of forfeiture enures
only to the complainant in whose
favor it is made ; it cannot be
taken advantage of by third par-
ties. Gritchley v. Graham, 2W.

But if a claimholder re-registers his claim, either 1
with or without re-marking, such registration will be
an abandonment of his previous title («) ; and where 1
an amalgamated claim had been registered (y) it
was held (over-ruling The Parade G.M. Go. v. Victoria
United Go. (z), which was a decision given on an
interlocutory application for injunction) that the pre-
vious separate titles to the claims could not be relied
on ( a ) ; and where under | a by-law (6) which pro-
vided that the width of i quartz claim should not
exceed 750 feet, and also that adjoining claims might
be amalgamated and re-registered as one claim, the
registration of an amalgar: lated claim was held good,
though the width of the < laim as amalgamated and
re-registered exceeded 750 feet (c).
A complainant cannot acquire title by an adjudi-
cation of the Warden against a person wrongly
registered, at least so far as regards the legally
registered owner. Where a mining registrar regis-
tered a person by mistake for a claim which was
already registered in the name of a third party, an
adjudication of forfeiture and possession against the
second (illegally) registered owner is of no avail
as against the first and correctly registered owner (d).

Suspension of
work.
Neither can a person flailing to comply with the
by-laws, and thus rendering his claim liable to for-
feiture, revive or redeem his title by falling back on
the fact of due compliance with the by-laws by a for-
mer registered owner. Thus, in 1874 Higgs and
party were duly registered for a claim in compliance
with the by-laws. In March, 1875, Hartly applied
to the Warden to be put in possession of the claim
on the ground of forfeiture, and obtained an adju-
dication in his favor. In May, 1875, Hartley regis-
tered himself as owner of the claim by independent
registration without obtaining the cancellation of
the registration of Higgs and party, but neglected
to comply with the provision of the by-laws (e)
requiring a survey and plan, with which provision
Higgs and party had complied. In December, 1875,
Hartley transferred to Rigby, who obtained regis-
tration as transferree of Hartley, but did not comply
with the by-laws by obtaining a survey and plan.
On an application by Beavan for forfeiture of the
claim on the ground of such non-compliance it was
held that Rigby could not; avail himself of the acts
of the antecedent registered owners (Higgs and
party), who had obtained a survey and plan, and
that the plan provided and used by Higgs and
party on their registration could not be applied by
Rigby to the claim which Hartley had registered
afresh without reference to Higgs’s registration (/).

the by-laws. Protection registration is created en-
tirely by the by*±aars, and is granted as of course on
application to the mining registrar under certain
conditions named in the by-laws, such as inability to
work owing to flooding of"" the mine, the necessity of
suspending work pending the erection of machinery,
or while making preliminary arrangements to form a
company.
A certificate of registration granted on a
verbal application (a) was field to be ineffectual as an
excuse for not working a claim where the by-laws
required the application to be in writing. It may be
doubted whether a written application is intended for
the assistance and protection of the registrar, and
which he therefore might!dispense with, or for the
protection of the interests of the mining public.
There may be purposes for which writing would
'afford material evidence against the applicant, and if
the application were not in;writing persons enquiring
might find no means in the registrar’s office of ascer-
taining the ground on which it was sought, or its
truth or falsehood, or its date ; it is a matter of public
importance, and should be obligatory (h). But unless
the by-laws require the application to be in writing it
may be made verbally.
Some of the by-laws re( uire a declaration show-
ing the cause why protect! >n registration should be
granted, but whether the statement or declaration of
the cause of suspension be Written or verbal, it must
be true ; for the efficacy )f protection registration
depends on the truth and sufficiency of the declara-

A certificate of protectiod registration of a claim
which is liable to forfeitui e will not save the for-
feiture previously incurred (/); neither will it
amount to a constructive working of yie claim (g)
so as to redeem a title forfeited by a previous non-
fulfilment of requirements! as to employment of
labor ( li ).
Protection registration is held under the by-law
under which it is taken, no! withstanding the subse-
quent repeal of such by-law (i). It is granted by
the mining registrar to the holder of a claim properly
applying for it ; and a hole er of a claim seeking
protection registration (j) was held to mean the regis-
tered holder; persons not re< istered could not avail
themselves of the by-law and obtain protection
registration ( k ).
A certificate of registration must be
signed by the mfcog registrar, or, if the by-laws
permit of it, by his assistant; but the assistant must
sign by his own name as assistant, not' merely doing
business for himself and then signing the name of the
mining registrar. A certificate of protection registra-
tion signed “ Harrie Wood per D. Christie, Mining
Registrar,” was held to be bad (1).

The reasons for applying fhr protection registration
must not merely be true, hut) must clearly show why
the protection registration :s sought. Under a by-
law (m) allowing suspension of work on the ground of
“ breakage of machinery, or any other sufficient cause
to be settjed by the Warden ’ no protection is afforded
by a suspension certificate granted on the ground of
“want of machinery to cnsh, &c.,” where the evi-
dence showed that the grcund of application for
protection registration referred to the stoppage of a
public crushing machine at which the claimholder
usually had his stone crushed. The by-law refers to
machinery connected with claim, and not to an
independent public crushing Machine (n).
And where a by-law (o) Required work to be re-
sumed within twenty-four h|urs after the expiration
of the period of protection re ristration, otherwise for-
feiture, and the registered h( Ider of a claim was pre-
vented from resuming worh| in consequence of his
claim being flooded, and it could not be drained
except at a ruinous expense' it was held that not-
withstanding this the by-law applied, and that a for-
feiture of the claim had been incurred ( p).
A certificate of protection registration wrongly'
obtained is not altogether void, but voidable, and a
person obtaining a certificate of suspension for the
purpose of forming a company, and failing to do so
within the time required by tle by-laws, can only be
dispossessed by legal proceedings ( q ). “Courts are

false pretences, it was held t lat the certificate was

could be enforced, it was held that the certificate of

to procure or post the certificate required by the
by-laws ( w ) will not deprive him of the benefit of
protection from forfeiture of his claim, though he may
be liable to other penalties (L?).
A person obtaining protec ion registration is bound
to comply with the conditions under which it is
granted, and a second certificate of suspension will
not cure a forfeiture incun ed during tire existence
of a prior certificate, the ccnditions of which have
not been complied with ( y).
The by-laws generally forbid the granting of a
second certificate of protection registration unless
work shall have been resumed after the expiration
of the period of the first certificate, and continued
for a time limited by the by-laws, as a continuous
series of suspension certificates would lock up the
claim indefinitely, and enable a claimholder to “ shep-
herd ” his claim without working it as long as he
thought fit. A certificate of protection registration
forms only a kind of dies won, and unless the by-
laws permit of it, and specially provide for a limited
time after its expiration for resumption of work, as
in Duffy v. Tail (z), work must be resumed imme-
diately on the expiration of the period of protection
registration.

WRONGFUL INTERFERENCE WITH MINING
INTERESTS.

Sec. I.
Definition of
trespass.
Possession good
as against a
wrongdoer.
SECTION I.—TRESPASS.
(a) What will Constitute Trespass.
Any entry on a claim in the occupation or pos-
session of another person is a trespass upon that
claim unless such entry cai| be justified. The question
of actual damage done is immaterial; a trespass is an
injury in itself. In mining suits trespass is usually
held to be constituted by a wrongful entry on the
surface of or interference with the title of a claim ;
while encroachment, though itself a species of trespass,
is limited to the workings of a mine by trespassing
beyond the boundaries (a).
As against a trespasser the law leans towards the
person in possession, and a person in possession of a
claim, whether the title to it be good or bad, is entitled
to maintain trespass against a mere wrongdoer with-
(a) See post, sec. 11, “ Encroachment.”


out color of title (6); ami if a person takes posses-
sion wrongfully according to the doctrine of Critch-
ley v. Graham (c) and holds possession quietly, it
would be a great straining of that case to say that
another would be warranted in trespassing upon him ,
in fact the peace preserving policy of Critchley v.
Graham would be against the trespasser (d) ; and a
person in possession of ground as a claim, although
the claim may have been taken up under a by-law
which is ultra vires, may maintain trespass and can
only be disturbed in his : possession by legal pro-
ceedings (e).
It is no excuse for a tr Ts'passer to plead that the 1
trespass was committed by his servants. Persons who
contract by consent not tb do a particular act are not
afterwards allowed to do that act by their servants,
and get the profit of it, and retain the profit of it, and
at the same time escape tl eir liability for the act by
saying that they had givm no express directions to
their servants to do it (/). But a hired servant of a
claimholder not acting under his orders will stand in
the same position as regards a complaint against him
for trespass as the claimholder would if he were a
defendant (g) ; and where ja person acting under the
direction of another commits a trespass, and the owner
brings an action of trespass against him which he
defends under instructions; from his principal and is
beaten, the judgment does not operate as an estoppel
against the principal ( h ).

Trespass on
amalgamated
claims.
U nintentional
trespass.
Wilful trespass.
Where several claims have been amalgamated it
does not necessarily follow that a trespass upon one of
them is a trespass upon th£m all ( i ) ; and where two
claims have been amalgamated, and the amalgamated
claim has not been regisiered separately as such,
though trespass be proved <|n the amalgamated claim,
it must be shewn on which of the separate claims the
trespass was committed (j).|
Trespass upon claims is frequently committed unin-
tentionally and without any desire to injure the claim
trespassed upon, or to take gold from it. A trespasser
who has a bond fide belief in his title, in an action
brought by the true owner to recover the value of
gold and quartz taken from the mine, is entitled to
receive credit for the expense of hewing and hauling
(Jc) ; and where a trespass or encroachment by a
neighboring company has been unintentional and un-
concealed, the company encroaching is entitled to the
cost of working the ground, encroached upon (I).
But a trespasser not in possession under any colour
of title, and not under ly any mistake as to facts,
though misapprehending tle law, will not be entitled
to deduct the expenses c f obtaining the gold (m) ;
neither will wilful trespa ;sers be allowed the cost of
winning gold obtained b' 7 them ( n ) ; though a tres-
passer who raised quartz from his own land, and also

from other land on which hfe was unwittingly trespas-
sing, was held to be entitled to the expense of raising
and crushing the quartz obtained from his own land
(o). But in the same case, where the Master in Equity
found an entire quantity of auriferous substances
raised from plaintiffs and defendant’s mines by de-
fendant, who was a trespasser on plaintiff’s mine, and
also how much thereof was raised from eaeh, and the
total yield of gold from such entire quantity, but
there was no evidence to show how much gold was
obtained from each, Molesworth J. held that the
plaintiffs were not entitled to claim the whole of the
gold, but that it should be divided proportionately
( P ); yet this decision was reversed on appeal, and the
plaintiffs were held entitled, on the doctrine of per
confusionem, to the whole of the gold (q).
And where an order was made against a defendant 1
company that they might continue to work on land
the title of which was in dispute on the terms of
keeping an account of the gold obtained, and the
defendants worked the land in conjunction with land
to which they had a good title, and mixed the quartz
from both before extracting the gold from it, and then
paid into the bank a proportionate part of the gold
obtained from the mixed quiartz, it was held by the
Full Court, reversing the decision of Molesworth J. (r),
that the defendant company had committed a distinct
breach of the order, and they were ordered to pay into
the bank the whole of the proceeds of the gold ob-
tained from the quartz so mixed by them (s).

Pending
application
for lease.
Where lease has
expired.
Any person who enters upon land pending the
application for a mining or license of such land
for the purpose of marking out the same as a claim,
or of including within the boundaries of any claim
the land applied for, or any part of it, is deemed to
have trespassed or encroached on such land (t) ; and
the pendency of such application for lease is enacted
to begin with the marking out of the land by the
applicant for such lease (u). The Act No. 291, sec.
37 [No. 1120, sec. 65] would by itself make a person
taking up a claim after an application for a lease of
the same ground a provisional trespasser only, subject
to the fate of the application (v) ; but the Act No.
446, sec. 3 [No. 1120, sec. 70] makes an entry on land
marked out for a lease absolutely a trespass, whether
such entry be for the purpose of occupying or other-
wise interfering with the hand or not ( w ), subject,
however, to due compliance with the leasing regula-
tions ( x ).
Where, however, the tertn of a lease has expired
all holders of miners’ rights are equally entitled to take
possession of the land ( y ), though the marking out of
the land prior to the expiry of the lease confers no title,
even though the miner marking out is and remains
in possession after such expiry. And the defendant
in a complaint for trespassing on a claim so marked
out is entitled to show that at the time of the mark-
ing out a third party had a lease of the ground, and
may put the lease in evidence to show the invalidity

of the title on which the complainant relies (z). But a
jus tertii, or the alleged power of intervention by a
third party to prevent an unauthorised act, which
power has not been exercised, cannot be set up by a
trespasser who has not a shadow of title in himself
against a trespasser in prior occupation of the
land (a).
Marking out and applying for a lease of land in the
occupation of a person under his miner’s right is not
a trespass upon or unlawful interference with the
land applied for. It is an insult rather than an injury
to the person in possession, and forms no ground of
action, especially as the marking out is the only legi-
timate means for a person} acquiring or seeking to
acquire a title by lease, and trying the claimholder’s
title to the claim ( b ).
Trespass suits are perhapi more frequently insti-
tuted for the purpose of test ng title, as in Truswell
v. Pawning (c), than for the recovery of damages, as
in Att. Gen. v. Boyd (d ). Th& latter remedy is usually
sought by suit for encroachment (e), though of course
persons maintaining trespass are entitled to prove and
recover damages against the trespasser.
In cases where there is no proof of actual damage
done—where it is a mere matter of calculation and
estimate—it is necessary for me court to ascertain by
distinct evidence that the partijes are trespassers (/).

Measure of
damages.
Actual
jxissession not
necessary.
Possession
defado.
The measure of damages Jtvill be ascertained as in
an ordinary action of tresp4ss, and where the injury
is remote damages will not be allowed. Thus, it is no
ground for damages in a spit for trespass that the
continuing trespass of the defendants caused an ob-
struction to the plaintiffs obtaining a lease of the land
comprised in their claim (g). \ The measure of damages
is always made high, and even where there is no proof
of actual damage, a wilful trespasser will not be
allowed the expenses of working the mine; as against
trespassers the highest valiie is taken, and the
Supreme Court can, on append from the Court of
Mines, increase the damages Awarded by the latter
court, if considered insufficient (h).
(b) Who can Sue for Trespass.
The holder of a miner’s right who has established
1 his title to a claim as against o diers who retain actual
possession after adjudication against them can main-
tain trespass against those ill possession. It is not
necessary for a claimholder to have been in actual
physical possession of his claim to entitle him to
maintain trespass ; he is not bound first to proceed
for ejectment and obtain actual possession (a). And
if a plaintiff in a suit for trespass prove prior posses-
sion de facto, the legality of such possession in respect
of compliance with the by-laws cannot be questioned
by the defendant ( h ) ; and a defect in a plaintiff s title

The possession of a miner’s right in a plaintiff claim-

Possession by forfeiture collusively obtained gives
no right to sue for trespass as against persons in pos-
session. Thus, the holder of a miner’s right obtained
a declaration of forfeiture and possession on payment
for improvements ; he to)k possession, but did not
pay the money. The latter part of the order was
quashed, but meanwhile a friend of the defaulters in
collusion with them obtained a declaration of for-
feiture and possession agai ist them, registered himself
for the claim and transferred it to the plaintiff, who
instituted a suit for trespass against the defendants,
who were in possession un ier the first forfeiture. It
was held that the forfeiture collusively obtained did
not form a new title, and plaintiffs could not maintain
the suit ( p ).
(c) Suits for Trespass.
A suit for trespass may b$ instituted either in the
Court of Mines (a) or before the Warden (b) ; but the
jurisdiction conferred by The Mines Act on the Court
of Mines and the Warden in trespass does not deprive
a plaintiff* of Ids right to proceed in another court
having jurisdiction. Thus, when a complaint for tres-
pass is dismissed by the Warden by way of non-suit,
the complainant having failed to make out his case,
and no question of title having been decided, the com-
plainant is not estopped from proceeding in the
Supreme Court, although he has not appealed to the
Court of Mines against the Warden’s decision (c).

11l a suit for trespass vfhich is virtually a test of
title it ‘is the plaintiff’s duty to show such a title as
will empower him to maintain trespass. If the de-
fendant challenges the complainant’s title it lies upon
him (the defendant) to show that the plaintiff in pos-
session has a flaw in his title, such as that he has not
complied with the by-laws in taking up the claim ( d ).
Possession alone is primd facie evidence of title,
and is a sufficient title against a mere wrongdoer.
The defendant must show his right to enter on the
land. And a defect in plaintiffs title suing for tres-
pass will not subject him to be defeated in a suit by a
defendant entering without legal process according to
the doctrine of Critchley v. Graham (e).
A miner’s right or miners’ rights held by the com-
plainants are a condition precedent to a suit for
trespass, and where a number of miners sue for tres-
pass and only some of them have miners’ rights in
force, the Warden cannot make an order in favor of
the complainants generally, or in favor of those hold-
ing miners’ rights (/).
And in such a case, where |tll the complainants have
not miners’ rights, and damages are sought, the
damages ought to be apportioned, and an apportion-
ment recovered only by those who had miners’ rights

fact that the opposite party had not obtained such
permission ( h).
The law leans against trespassers, and as shown
above will not only not allow a trespasser any portion
of the gold obtained by him from the claim trespassed
upon, but where quartz has been removed by a tres-
passer, such quartz, in the absence of evidence to the
contrary, will be held to be auriferous, and a decree
made for an account of the value of the gold re-
moved (i).
Where land was found to have been
and the only communication with the part under-
mined was by drives from a shaft on adjoining land,
it was held that in the absence of evidence to the con-
trary this afforded evidence of trespass and removal
of the subsoil by the owner of such shaft (j).
SECTION lI.—ENCROACHMENT.
(a) What will Constitute Encroachment.
A distinction is drawn in The Mines Act between
trespass and encroachment, though the legal definition
of trespass will include encroachment. In mining law
encroachment means encroaching without right or
justification by the owner of one claim beyond the
boundaries of his claim, whether on or below the
surface, upon and within the boundaries of an adjoin-
ing claim. It may be regarded as trespass, but only

as between adjoining claimholders, for though a claim-
holder can trespass on a claim which does not adjoin
his he cannot encroach oh such a claim.
As distinguished from trespass encroachment may
he carried on underground for a long time before it is
known, or even suspected. In case of a suspicion of
encroachment an order may be obtained for inspection
(a) of the mine the owner of which is suspected of
encroaching ; and where owners of property suspect
that it is being encroached upon they are quite right
to wait until they can fix definitely the responsibility
on the persons encroaching, before taking legal pro-
ceedings, and any such delay is not an acquiescence in
the encroachment which would disentitle the parties
to relief (6).
If a person believes that his land is being en-
croached upon he should at once ascertain what his
exact boundaries are, and if another person come near
his boundary to sink a shaft, by reason of which he is
led to believe that trespass or encroachment is
intended, he should take immediate steps to assert his
claim and prevent an encroachment (c), otherwise
knowingly permitting an encroachment may be re-
garded as an acquiescence in it.
The manner in which the (dimensions and bound-
aries of claims are shown mist be specified by the
by-laws. Under the Act Nj). 32 it was held that a
by-law which omitted to specify how the boundary
lines of a claim were to be drawn was held void for
uncertainty, and a complaint for encroachment could

not be maintained in respedt of a claim taken np
under it ( d ).
(b) Who can Sue for Encroachment.
All lawful holders of claims are entitled to prevent
their neighbors from encroaching on them. A person
in possession of a claim, whether his title be good or
bad, is entitled to recover damages in a complaint for
encroachment against a common wrongdoer with no
color of title (a). For though a miner may have a
good title to his own claim, yet he has no right to
mine beyond his boundaries and thus encroach upon
land to which he has no title whatever.
And a person in actual possession of a claim which
has been wrongfully taken up without legal process
according to the principle of Critchley v. Graham can
maintain a suit for encroachment against all but the
rightful owner ( h) ; and in like manner a title by
occupation can resist a suit for encroachment (c).
The occupier of a machine area has no claim to the
gold within his area as against a person who holds
the land under miner’s right as a claim ; and a miner
occupying land as a machine area under his miner’s
right by permit of the Warden cannot maintain en-
croachment against other miners within the bound-
aries of whose claim the machine area is situated for
undermining such area and removing the gold. The
occupier of the machine site has only a title to the
surface. He has no right to the gold, and the claim-
holders have ; and it was held that it was not neces.

But where the holder of jb miner’s right was in
occupation of ground as a residence site (/), and the
defendant applied for a lease of such site with other
ground, and commenced mining on the ground and
within such residence site, and the lease was subse-
quently granted, and the residence area was excised,
it was held that a suit for encroachment might be

Where a company made a drive across a street past 1
the centre of the road, and encroached on portion of
the street occupied by another company, an injunction ]
was granted against the encroachment, but only as to
the ground beyond the medium filum vice (I). But
in the subsequent case of The Garibaldi Go. v. Craven’s
New Chum Go. (m) it was decided that a Crown
grantee of land, with an exception or reservation in
the grant of all gold and auriferous earth and stone,
could not restrain a stranger from removing gold and
auriferous earth and stone from the land, although
such stranger might be a trespasser against the Crown,
and that such a grant showed no title to the auriferous
earth and stone ; and over-ruling Davies v. The Queen
(n) it was held that the definition of the boundary of
land in a Crown grant by i road did not create a
property in the soil of the road ad medium filum
via.i (o ).
A lessee in possession unddr a gold mining lease is
entitled to maintain encroachment and to restrain
tortious mining on the land included in his lease, and
the removal of gold therefrom (p); and an applicant
for a lease whose application has been granted can
proceed for encroachment and restitution of the gold
taken out of the leased ground against a person who

Possession is primd facie evidence of title, and is a
good and sufficient title p&r se as against a mere
wrongdoer to subject him to a suit for encroachment;
The Mines Act, sec. 135 (iii.) does not confine the
remedy for encroachment to plaintiffs having a good
title, or indirectly oblige them to show a good title, in
addition to showing their possession undisturbed (e).
And where plaintiffs werd exclusive licensees in
possession of private land suing defendants for en-
croachment on the licensed h nd, it was not necessary
to prove the title of the licensor (/).
A plaintiff in a suit for I encroachment will not,
however, be allowed to pvovi a different case to that
put forward in Ins bill. Thus] where plaintiffs by their
bill and affidavits made a case of encroachment against
the defendant company by neans of branch drives,
but failed to substantiate such encroachment, they
were not allowed to prove ercroachment by means of
the defendant company’s main drive, which was con-
structed five years previously, as that encroachment
was a different case to the or/e set forth in the bill (<j)■
Evidence of witnesses engaged in an encroachment

and uncontradicted ( h ).

(d) Damages for Encroachment.
The valuation of damage done by encroachment is
always made high, with the feeling of odium spoli-

Court] (h) from the decree of the Court of the Mines
awarding damages for encroachment, the appellate
Court may increase the damages if such damages be
considered too low (c).
Where an encroachment by a neighboring company
has been unintentional and unconcealed the company
encroaching is entitled to be allowed the cost of work-
ing the ground encroached upon (d) ; but a wilful
trespasser will not be allowed, in taking an account of
the value, any expenses of rjiining and separating the
gold, and where there is no proof of actual damage
done the maxim applies tliat as against trespassers
the highest value is taken (e).

ment is not a matter for an acco int in equity, nor can

In a complaint for encroachment before the War-
den, where several claimhofders (plaintiffs) had not
miners’ rights at the time of the encroachment, it was
held that the Warden should assess damages generally,
and out of them award an amount in proportion to
the number of shares held by the claimholders entitled
to institute proceedings by virtue of their miners’
rights (g) ; and where a mining company holding its
claim by two trustees instituted a suit for encroach-
ment, and miners’ rights wefe produced for the com-
pany and one trustee but not for the other, the
by-laws requiring registration of holders of claims as
necessary to a valid title, it was held that the Warden
should assess damages to those who produced miners’
rights in respect of their shares only (h) ; and in case
of an encroachment de die in diem, if some of the
complainants have not miners’ rights the Warden or
the Court should divide the time, and give the
damages accordingly (i).
(e) Orders of Inspection.
Apart from the power inherent in the Supreme
Court to order inspection, tjie Warden has special
power vested in him (a) by writing under his hand to
authorise an entry, which is usually done by a mining
surveyor, on any land or cliaim to ascertain if the
owner of such claim is encroaching on his neighboring
claimholders, and for that purpose to make use of the
machinery of the party suspected of encroaching (6);

Hearsay.
and with regard to the power of obtaining use of such
machinery, it has been held that orders for liberty to
inspect a mine which is in full operation at the time
the order is made are based on the supposition that
the mine will go on working] and that there will con-
sequently be facilities for going up and down (c).
It is only reasonable that a mine owner should
object to any inspection of his mine by adjoining
mine owners, and to the publication of a knowledge
of his works ; and the Court will recognise this disin-
clination of mining companies to submit to inspection
of their mines. Thus, where there was a suspicion
that inspection was sought for an indirect object of
obtaining a knowledge of the workings of an ad-
joining mine the application for inspection was refused
with costs (cl) ; and in cases of encroachment, an order
for inspection will not be granted so long as there are
other means open to the parties of obtaining the
required information (e).
But otherwise for the rectification of an error.
Where a plan forming part of an agreement as to the
boundaries of two mines showed the shaft in the
wrong position, the evidence o:: the surveyor was not
received to explain the discrepancy, but it was ordered
that plaintiff should be at liberty to inspect de-
fendant’s mine in order to procure evidence of the
true position of the encroachment complained of with
reference to the real boundaries' (/).

tain the extent of the encroachment, if any, the case
made by the plaintiffs was one of hearsay. But as
the defendants by their answer had not stated in
detail what they were actually doing, but made a
general assertion that they were not encroaching, and
had not stated that any definite injury would result
from the inspection of their mine, inspection was
granted ( g).
And an order was made for the inspection by plain-
tiffs of the mining works of the defendant alleged by
plaintiffs to be an encroachment on their private
land (h).
And where persons are mining underneath public
streets, and subsidence takes place, the corporation in
charge of such streets may obtain an order of inspec-
tion (i).
But inspection of a mine on private land was re-
fused where no demand was made by a person entitled
to inspect as on behalf of the Grown ( j).

injunction is asked to prevent threatened or appre-

granted whether the person against whom it is sought
is or is not in possession under any color of title or
otherwise, or (if not in possession) does or does not
claim a right to do the act sought to be restrained
under any color of title, and whether the estates
claimed by both or either of the parties be legal or

Under the Act No. 82 an injunction was obtained
by a party of miners mining under a public street
against another party interfering with them, although
the land could not be held under miner’s right, on the
ground that the party seeking the injunction were the
earliest occupiers (6).
Where on application for an interlocutory injunction
to restrain a nuisance to land by accumulation of
sludge upon it, if there is no question of title or as to
the fact of the nuisance, but only as to whether the
nuisance is committed by defendants, an injunction
will be granted without an issue at law being directed
to ascertain that fact (c).
And an interlocutory injunction was granted

Special power is vested in the Warden by The
Mines Act to grant an order enjoining persons named
therein from encroaching on, using, or working a
claim, on notice served twenty-four hours at least
before the time of making the application (e); and he
may grant an interim injunction order, to be in force
for seven days, in cases of pressing emergency, with-
out notice (/). An interim injunction order by the
Warden is granted under special powers vested in him
by the Act, and should be limited to time. The
injunction may, however, be made perpetual on the
final decree (g) ; but the Warden cannot grant an
injunction pending an application for a lease ( h).
The Court of Mines and every judge thereof has the
same powers of granting injunction orders as are
vested in the Supreme Court or any judge thereof (i);
and by The Judicature Act [Supreme Court Act 1890]
the inferior courts have power to grant relief or
redress in as full and ample a manner as might or
ought to be done in like cases by the Supreme
Court ( j).
An injunction order will not be granted against a
person not a party to the suit ( k) ; and in order to
obtain an injunction a plaintiff must show a primd
facie case that an inference fairly arises that he will
ultimately succeed in his suit, though it need not

tiff’s equity is doubtful an injunction will not be

It is also necessary that a plaintiff should be clearly
informed of his rights and take steps to assert them
at once, for an injunction will not be granted to
restrain a trespass where the plaintiffs were aware
that defendants had worked the ground in respect of
which the injunction is sought for two years, and had
taken no steps to prevent them (- n ) ; and parties in
possession without showing any title cannot obtain
an injunction until the hearing of the suit (o) ; neither
will an injunction be granted with reference to an
injury already accomplished (p) ; and it seems a
mining registrar is not subject to an injunction in

An injunction order is not to be interpreted retro-
spectively unless its terms clearly require it (r); and
where an injunction order admits of two constructions
the defendants may properly assume the responsibility
of putting their own construction on it (s).
When a plaintiff obtains an injunction the order is
made on such terms as the Court may think fit, those

does not necessarily determine the suit, but only
maintains intact and inviolate property which might
otherwise pending the final decision of the Court be
destroyed (u).
A title acquired by taking possession of ground
subject matter of an application for injunction, and
subsequently obtaining registration therefor, was held
not to be a sufficient defence to such application ( v).
(b) Breach of Injunction Order.
The fact that a complete and literal compliance
with an injunction order would absolutely stop the
defendants from working is not an excuse for breach
of the injunction. It is a ground for moving the
Court to modify the injunction, and such a motion
may be made by a defendant even when in contempt
for disobedience of the order (a).
But finishing work necessary to the stability or use
of a mine is not a breach of an injunction against the
owner of such mine not to work it ( b ) ; and a mere
oversight subjecting a defendant to the liability of the
consequences of the breach of an injunction will not
be considered a contempt (c).

SECTION I.—BY ABANDONMENT.
(ktj Actual or Intentional Abandonment.
f
A claimholder may voluntarily abandon his claim
at any time, and such abandonment amounts to a
relinquishment of it in favor of any portion of the
mining public who may choose to take it up. And
where a claim has been actually abandoned it is open
to the first legal claimant (a), and may be marked out
as a claim by any holder of (a miners right (b).
The well-known case of Gritchley v. Graham (c)
formulated the axiom that claims forfeited or con-
structively abandoned could only be taken* possession
of under the adjudication of the Warden. But this
axiom will not apply to a claim which has been
actually or intentionally abandoned. No express

renunciation of a claim is necessary to show that it
lias been abandoned (d), as a miner, after satisfying
himself that his claim was worthless, could not be
expected to give notice td the world that he had
thrown up his interest in it.
And, indeed, the application of Gritchley v. Graham
to claims actually and intentionally abandoned would
necessarily result in great hardship and inconvenience,
for it would be manifestly unjust to require a person
wishing to take up a claim registered in the name of
another, and which may have been actually aban-
doned for a long time, to search through the colony
for the original registered owner for the purpose of
making him a defendant, or to obtain substitution of
service of a summons upon him in case he could not
be found ; while it would be still more unjust to sub-
mit to vexatious proceedings before the Warden, and
consequent costs, a man who had voluntarily relin-
quished his claim, and who) had no desire to defend
his title.
And thus it has been decided that where around
has been abandoned de fact > it may be taken up by
any holder of a miner’s right without any previous
adjudication of abandonment ( e ).
In Gritchley v. Graham tile Court had to deal with
the case of defendants claiming by forfeiture against
plaintiffs in clear visible possession, and intimated
that it would decide otherwise in case of actual
abandonment. In Landry v. Barton (/) it was taken

for granted that abandonment without a Warden’s
order put an end to title. People forgetting a right
as valueless would never expressly say they aban-
boned it (g).
And a sluicing claim duly applied for ( h ) can be
taken possession of as abandoned ground without an
adjudication of forfeiture, if abandoned de facto; but
if the suspension of work on the claim is bona fide
for want of sufficient water for sluicing purposes, this
will not amount to actual abandonment (i).
The Act No. 291, sec. 7,1 (x.) [No. 1120, sec. 106
(x.)] authorises the mining‘boards to make by-laws
determining what shall constitute relinquished, aban-
doned, or deserted claims, as distinguished from
forfeited claims; and the Act No. 446, sec. 27 [No.
1120, sec. 10] provides that “ any claim which shall be
apparently unoccupied, and upon which there is no
plant or machinery, and which has been unworked for
a longer period than is allowed by the by-laws of the
district, or for any division or part thereof, in which
such claim is situated, shall be deemed to be actually
abandoned ground, and may, without any adjudication
of forfeiture or abandonment, be taken up and regis-
tered as a claim in accordance with the by-laws by
any holder of a miner’s right, but subject nevertheless
to the rights (if any still subsisting) of any previous
occupier of such ground.”
In view of this provision, therefore, though such a
proceeding is, as before shewn, unnecessary, it may
prove a wise precaution fop a claimholder who desires
to relinquish his claim within the time stated by the
(g) Warrior O.M. Co. v. Cot-
ter, 3 W.W. and a’B. (M.) 81.

by-laws under the above section to expressly abandon
it, and apply to the mining registrar to have his
registration of it cancelled, in order to save himself
from the possible contingency of a complaint before
the Warden at the suit of any person who may be
desirous of taking up the abandoned claim.
(h) Constructive Abandonment.
A claimholder may, however, without wishing to
relinquish his claim, by default in working it or by
other means so neglect it thdt the law justly construes
such neglect or default into a virtual abandonment of
the claim. This is called constructive abandonment
as distinguished from actual or voluntary abandon-
ment, and in such a case the principle of Critchley v.
Graham will apply, viz., that the Warden’s adjudica-
tion of possession must be obtained as against the
claimholder by any person seeking to take advantage
of the abandonment (a).
The courts will always lean against the view of
actual abandonment unless tjhe claim be relinquished
by express declaration of owner, such as cancella-
tion of his registration. Intentional abandonment is
O
only to be proved by cogent evidence of express
declaration, or of unambiguous acts or conduct; on
the other hand the very smallest act animo possi-
dendi is sufficient to negative! such exception ( b ).
Resumption of work on a claim which has been
actually or constructively aba idoned will not cure the
defect in the title, or create a new title. To make

claim it should either have been actually abandoned,
or adjudged forfeited by the Warden ; otherwise all
forfeitures might be avoided by a mere resumption of
work and going through the form of re-pegging the
ground (c).
“The next objection,” says Molesworth J. (d), “is
that the ground said to have been abandoned ought to
have been declared abandoned by a Warden before
the plaintiffs were at liberty to' occupy it, but the
cases which require such an adjudication are those of
constructive forfeiture, and not of abandonment in
fact.” In the case under notice the holders of a claim,
after registering it under the by-laws, obtained a lease
of part of the same ground, and it was held by Moles-
worth J. that this afforded a presumption that they
had abandoned any portion of the original claim which
was not included in the parcels of the lease ; and that
working a shaft which was partly on the excluded
ground, but merely for the purpose of working the
ground included in the lease, did not negative the
presumption of abandonment. On appeal to the Privy
Council, however (e), their Lordships held that the
very smallest act animo possidendi was sufficient to
negative the presumption of abandonment, and that in
the absence of some strong evidence to the contrary ?
or of some adverse possession, the continued posses-
sion of any part of any district of land held under
one title was in itself continued possession of the
whole.
Taking up a claim afresh is an abandonment of the
title acquired by a previous taking up (/), and

in re-pegging and re-registering a claim each succes-
sive registration will constitute an abandonment of
the previous title ( g ).
Thus, taking up a block claibi within the limits of
a frontage claim is an abandonment of the frontage
title to the extent of the block taken up ( h) f and a
claimholder holding under such new title cannot, when
the new title is assailed, set up his former title as a
defence.
A collusive recovery for forfeiture, however, does
not constitute a new title to the claim ; though ac-
quiescence in such a collusive recover}' is an abandon-
ment of the title of the previous holder as between
him and the mining public (li).
Pumping water out of a claim, unless such pumping
be for the purpose of wonting the claim, is not suffi-
cient (j) to protect it from the consequences of
abandonment (k).
But a delay in proceeding to work ( I ) pending
survey of a claim, where the applicants had difficulty
in obtaining the services of a surveyor, who had no
office within ten miles, was held not to constitute
proof of abandonment under the by-laws (m).

Where a shareholder in a claim offered his share to
his co-partners if they would give him a release, which
they refused to do, and lie afterwards allowed his
share to lie dormant, and refused to pay his share of
expenses towards sinking a khaft, it was held that he
had not been guilty of such conduct as would reason-
ably lead his partners to - suppose that he had aban-
doned his share, and that he was entitled to his
interest in the claim (n). But otherwise where a
partner resigned his share, and through carelessness
refrained from asserting his right to it for a period of
nine years (o).
A person applying for too much ground may aban-
don part of the claim improperly taken, and defend
his title to the portion properly taken, if he has been
put in possession of the proper claim by the Warden
i'p) ; but the part into possession of which he has
been put by the Warden will become a new claim, and
should be pegged and registered as the smaller area.
Under a by-law containing a provision that a claim
should not be liable to forfeiture during any period
for which drainage fees were being paid ( q ) the claim
is not protected from being declared abandoned by the
Warden, on an application to be put in possession of
such claim, on the ground that the owners of it are
liable to pay drainage assessment, whether such pay-
ment has been made or not. There must be an actual
payment, and not a mere liability to pay (r).

( c) Means of Enforcing Abandonment.
The question whether or not a claim may be con-
sidered constructively abandoned may be determined
by the Court of Mines ( a ) or by the Warden (b) ; and
the inference of abandonment is a matter that is left to
the absolute discretion of the Court or Warden before
whom the question is tried (c).
The usual means of enforcing abandonment is by
complaint before the Warden, who has jurisdiction
under a by-law as to abandonment ( d ) without being
expressly named in the by-law ; for it is not necessary
to the efficacy of a by-law made under section 71 (x.)
of The Mining Statute [No. 1120, sec. 106 (x.)] that
it should point out a person to adjudicate, as section
177 [No. 1120, sec. 216] shows an intention to give
jurisdiction to the Warden in all cases of disputed
ownership of claims, and the duty of adjudication may
be left to him as the ordinary officer (e).
Under the Act No. 82 a by-law providing that the
Warden might declare any claim “relinquished” if
not worked in a bond fide manner was held good and
sufficient under section Ilf of that Act, enabling
mining boards to make by-laws prescribing the events
on which claims should bp deemed to be “ aban-
doned ” (/).

It is not necessary in seeking to enforce abandon-
ment or forfeiture to negative all the exceptions in a
by-law protecting an unworked claim from abandon-
ment which rest upon facts lying peculiarly within
the defendant’s knowledge ( g ).
An adjudication of abandonment by the Warden
enures only to the party in whose favor the Warden
decides ; it cannot be taken advantage of by others
(h). And in a complaint seeking to enforce abandon-
ment before the Warden, the Warden must decide
whether the claim is abandoned or not; such a ques-
tion is not a proper ground for a special case, resting
as it does upon facts (i).
SECTION lI.—BY FORFEITURE.
(a) Forfeiture under the By-laws.
When a miner has acquired a claim the law requires
nothing more from him than an obligation to work it,
and this obligation may be regarded as the true con-
sideration for which he receives the right and privi-
lege to work and mine on Crown land.
The by-laws determine the events on which the
title to a claim shall become forfeited (a), and com-
pliance with the by-laws as regards the proper
working of a claim will be strictly enforced by the
courts (6); for it is a maxim that courts are rigid in

construing laws imposing forfeiture (c), though they
will not adjudge forfeiture unless there are express
words in the by-law saying that a forfeiture is to be
worked (d).
In fact, by-laws are required to be construed accord-
ing to the same rules as are applied to Acts of Parlia-
ment (e); and it must be borne in mind that
conditions of forfeiture are to be determined by the
by-laws in force at the time the claim was taken up
and is held (/), notwithstanding their subsequent
repeal and that fresh conditions of forfeiture are
imposed by the repealing by-law. And if a by-law
enacts a forfeiture, but omits to point out by whom
the forfeiture may be enforced, such by-law is not
thereby rendered inoperative, but the forfeiture can
be enforced by any holder of a miner’s right ( g ) ; and
land once forfeited is open to the first claimant who
shall legally apply for it ( h ).
Forfeiture for non-working does not in itself
invalidate the title to a claim, so as to deprive the
claimholder absolutely of his interest in it. It makes
the interest in a claim not void, but voidable, and the
only means of avoiding it is by taking proceedings £Ol
forfeiture and possession on the principle of Gritchley
v. Graham (i). The claim cannot be taken up as
actually abandoned ( j).

When the
principle
applies.
Neither will forfeiture of a claim be regarded as an
assignment by operation of law, and the party put in
possession of it is not an assignee of the interest of
the former bolder, either as to date of title or other-
wise (k). A person going into possession of a legally
forfeited claim creates a new title for himself, which
title is distinct from and irrespective of any former
title, hut is subject to all thei liabilities, as it confers
all the privileges, of a new title.
(h) What will Constitute Forfeiture.
Under the Act No. 32, sejc. 77, it was decided that
before miners could avail themselves of a forfeiture or
a constructive abandonment of a claim in the actual
possession of other miners they were bound first to
obtain the adjudication of the Warden on the subject
(a); and section 101 of the Act No. 291 [No. 1120,
sec. 135] is not distinguishable from the section under
which Gritchley v. Graham was decided as to giving
possession by the Court of Mines, and section 177 of
the latter Act [No. 1120, sec. 216] gives the same
power to the Warden ( h ).
The same principle applied to persons in actual
occupation of a claim, though the possession be
irregular (c) ; and to a claim taken up under a by-law

person seeking to deprive miners in possession of
ground in excess of that which is permitted by the
by-laws ( g ).
Ihe dictum of Critchley v. Graham is paramount to
by-laws (h), and what has bieen happily termed the
peace-preserving policy of this decision has found its
way into subsequent mining legislation, and may be
considered as one of the strongest foundations of our
mining law.
But the principle of Critchley v. Graham will not
a Pp!y i n a contest between a mere intruder and a
person who asserts that he is the first and actual
holdei (%), for it would be manifestly unjust to require
a claimholder who held under a good title to take
proceedings against any unwarranted trespasser who
dlose to intrude on him, in order to assert his title.
Nor will the principle apply where a mining lease has
expired by effluxion of time ( j), for in such a case the
foi mer (leasehold) title is gone, and the land which
was held under, it is Crowh land without a legal
occupier; though the principle would apply in a
contest between two persons who had marked out
previous to the expiration of a lease (k). Neither
will the principle apply in a case where the claim
is actually abandoned ( I ), for if a claim is relinquished
(lc facto, with no possible expectation of the former
occupier ever coming back to it, such claim is then

open to any holder of a miner’s right, without the
necessity of the Warden’s adjudication to put him in
possession of it (m).
Another case which has become a leading case
in mining law is Coles v. Sparta (n), as formulating
the dictum that work done on a claim after a for-
feiture has been incurred will not cure the forfeiture.
In this case, where a claimholder did not actually
abandon his claim, but ceased working on it, whereby
it became liable to be forfeited under the by-laws,
and subsequently, without re-marking the claim, the
claimholder re-entered and resumed work upon it
as if no forfeiture had been incurred, it was held
that the subsequent work did not cure the forfeiture
previously incurred, irrespective of the question of
the necessity of stirring old pegs on claiming to
hold old ground under a new title.
But where a by-law enacts a limitation of the
time for enforcing forfeiture, in such a case (o) a
claimholder resuming the proper working of his
claim within the prescribed time will cure his lia-
bility for the previous forfeiture for non-working ( p ).
If, however, a by-law requires work to be resumed
within a stated time after the expiration of a period
of protection registration}, and enacts that otherwise
such claim shall be liable to forfeiture (q), and a
claimholder is prevented from resuming work by
reason of his claim being flooded, a forfeiture will
nevertheless be incurred, even though the claim could

not be drained except at an enormous expense (r),
and the maxim actus Dei nemini facit injuriam
will not apply. And a second certificate of suspen-
sion from work, or protection registration, will not
cure a forfeiture incurred during the period of the
first certificate of suspension, the conditions of which
have not been complied with (s).
The mere obtaining of certificate of protection
registration will not cure a forfeiture already incurred,
for a suspension certificate does not amount positively
to a constructive working of the claim during the
period of suspension, so as to cure a previous for-
feiture for non-working (t), where a limitation of time
for enforcing the forfeiture is prescribed by the
by-laws (u); the protection registration would not in
such a case be equivalent to a resumption of work.
And where no time is prescribed for enforcing for-
feiture, Coles v. Sparta will apply, so as to render
protection registration altogether useless to cure the
previous forfeiture.
A collusive recovery before the Warden for for-
feiture will not form a new title to the claim so
recovered so as to cure a forfeiture previously
incurred, though the claimholder acquiescing in such
collusive recovery will be deemed by such recovery to
to have abandoned his previous title (v). “In the case

collusive recovery by a friend undertaking to hold as
a trustee should be allowed to form a new title for the
defaulter.” Per Molesworth, Chief Judge ( w ).
Working on other land adjoining the claim alleged
to be forfeited may be working to save a forfeiture of
a claim, if done with a decided intention to mine the
claim, and with as great rapidity as to result as
working on the claim itself might reasonably have
(x) ; though this principle applies only where the
adjoining lands are the property of the same owner,
and cannot be taken advantage of where the lands
belong to different owners, even with a prospective
contingent arrangement for their eventually becoming
the property of the same owner (y).
It is not necessary that the work done shall be
actual digging in the mine; any bond fide work
performed for the purpose of winning the gold will be
sufficient to save a forfeiture. Thus, where a by-law
provided that pumping out water should be a protec-
tion to a claim from forfeiture for non-working (z), it
was held that pumping with a bond fide design of
reaching and working at earth within the claim was
working it (a).
An altogether different ground of forfeiture is where
a party of claimholders do not actually neglect to
work, but continue work on the claim with a lesser
number of men than are required by the by-laws. A
by-law which positively requires a certain number of

men to be employed According to tlie size of the claim
in effect says negatively that not less than that
number of men shall be employed (h). Thus, where a
by-law required a certain number of men to be
employed in proportion to the area occupied (c), and
the claimholders, finding they could not keep down
the water, knocked off some of the men and employed
a horse, and took steps to erect machinery but did not
erect it, it was held that the non-compliance with the
by-laws, however occasioned, rendered the claim liable
to foifeiture (d); for though protection registration
may be obtained under the by-laws pending the
erection of machinery, yet machinery will not be
considered in lieu of labor until it is erected (c); and
the mere drawing of water at the expense of an
adjoining claim, or burning quartz belonging to other
persons, and not for the purpose of extracting minerals
from the claim in dispute, will not be regarded as
working the claim so as to save a forfeiture if).
Under by-laws so enacting, money laid out on a
claim may, however, protect the claim from forfeiture
for non-working as against the parties expending
such money, though not |as against parties who
obtained possession of the claim as by forfeiture by
means of collusive proceedings (g) ; and where a
by-law imposes an obligation to advance a main drive
(h), this amounts to a duty imposed by the by-law,

A certificate of protection registration properly

where the certificate has been obtained by false represen-
tations (/.:) ; and a certificate of protection registration
granted on a verbal application, where the by-laws

tual as an excuse for non-working (m); but parties
obtaining protection registration for the purpose of
forming a company, and failing to do so within the
period of protection, may hold and work their claim
(n) ; and as the certificate of protection .registration
is voidable only, and not void ah initio (o), a claim-
holder whose certificate of protection registration is
assailed cannot be dispossessed except by legal process,
according to the doctrine of Critchley v. Graham (p) ;
and a claimholder merely neglecting to procure and
post a certificate of protection registration of his
claim, as required by the by-laws, does not by such
neglect deprive himself of the benefit of the protection
of his claim, or render it liable to forfeiture for

amalgamation of a claim liable to forfeiture with
other ground legally held will not cure a forfeiture,
even though since the amalgamation such work has
been done as would save the amalgamated claim as
an entire claim from forfeiture (s).
But taking more ground than the by-laws permit
to be taken does not work a forfeiture of the whole
claim taken up (t) ; it subjects it only to reduction
to the proper area.
Re-pegging a claim, not followed by registration
of it, will not redeem or revive a title to a claim
liable to forfeiture ( u ); in fact, such pegging may be
regarded as an abandonment of any former pegging,
and probably of the previous title to the claim,
irrespective of the question raised in Coles v. Sparta ,
but not decided in that case, as to whether a claim-
holder whose claim was liable to be forfeited could
form a new title for himself by shifting his pegs and
re-registering his claim ; for no one has a right to
hold simultaneously two claims on the same space
under distinct titles. The acquisition of a later right
is a merger of former rights (v).
An application for a lease by a claimholder is no
protection from forfeiture otherwise incurred, either
before or after such application ( w ), though no person

for as a lease pending the application (x), and the
pendency of the application for the lease will debar
the Warden from putting any one in possession of
the ground (y). The protection afforded by the
application is, however, merely quoad the applicant
for the lease, and if the lease is refused it is just
the same as if the application had not been made ( z ).
The Act No. 446 [incorporated with Act 1120, Part
I.] prohibits any person trespassing on the surface
of land subject of an application for a lease, pending
such application, for the purpose of marking it out
as a claim ; but though a person may not acquire a
claim pending the application for a lease, yet lie may,
without marking out, proceed before the Warden for
forfeiture of the claim, and though the Warden
cannot declare the land forfeited and put the com-
plainant in possession, unless default in the application
be shown («-), pending the application for the lease,
yet he may adjourn the case from time to time
until the application for the lease is decided, and if
the lease is refused lie can then order forfeiture of
the claim and put the complainant in possession ( h );
and a lease executed by the lessee after the expiry
of the time prescribed by the leasing regulations of
1871 (c) is not a valid lease, and is no defence
against a claimant for forfeiture and possession

Where two persons arfe registered for the same
claim by mistake of the mining registrar, and the
later registered holder forfeits his claim by leaving
it unworked, a party who obtains a declaration of
forfeiture from the Warden against such later holder,
and an order that he should deliver possession, cannot
take possession of the claim as against the person
who had been first registered, without giving notice
to him, and obtaining a declaration of abandonment
as against such first owner from the Warden ( e ).
(c) Illegal Occupation.
In addition to the liability a claimholder incurs
of forfeiting his claim for not properly working it
under the by-laws, a claim may be lost by being
unlawfully occupied by the person in possession of
it, as, for example, if he should fail to renew his
miner’s right, and should retain possession of his claim
after the term of his miner’s right has expired ; or if
he shall have entered into possession of more ground
than is permitted by the by-laws, in which case he is
regarded as being in unlawful possession of the excess
area. This is known as illegal occupation. Illegal
occupation may result from an infinite number of acts
or omissions, and though it is not defined by The
Mines Act it is somewhat akin to forfeiture, and
proceedings may be taken before the Warden in a
similar manner as for forfeiture to obtain possession
of land in the illegal occupation of the holder.

Evidence of.
Taking too
much ground.
Termination of
miners nght.
In a suit for possession byt reason of illegal occupa-
tion of a claim the claiinh.olq.er must defend his title,
whatever it may be, and it is not for the complainant
to prove the default. Thus, in a suit to obtain posses-
sion of a claim on the ground that the defendant is in
unlawful occupation, not being in possession of a
miner’s right in force, the onus is cast upon the
defendant to show that he had a miner’s right in force
at the commencement of the suit (a) ; but when the
defence to a suit for being in illegal occupation of a
claim was “priority of legal occupation for mining
purposes under the by-laws,” the defendant was per-
mitted to show title by possession, although such title
was not a legal one under the by-laws (b).
Persons marking out and taking up more ground
than is allowed by the by-laws are in illegal occupa-
tion of the excess area over and above that permitted
to be taken up, but such occupation of an excess area
will not work a forfeiture of the whole (c); and where
five persons are alleged to be in illegal occupation of
more ground than they are entitled to under the
by-laws, and five other persons holding miners’ rights
apply jointly to be put in possession of the ground,
the Warden has jurisdiction to entertain the applica-
tion and put the complainants in possession, and no
previous marking out of the claim is required ( d ).
The termination before comntencement of suit of the
miner’s right under which tike defendant had pre-
viously held his claim will terminate the defendant’s

interest in the claim as against the complainant,
unless the miner’s right he rejnewed ( e ).
In a suit seeking to be put in possession of land
alleged to be in the illegal occupation of another, it is
necessary to show on the face of the summons what
comprises the alleged illegal occupation. A summons
drawn merely for being in illegal occupation of a
claim, without showing in some degree the objection
to the defendant’s title, is too vague, and should be
amended (/). The defendant is entitled to know in
what respect his title is assailed, and unless the
summons be amended to show this it should be
dismissed.
(d) Means of Enforcing Forfeiture.
As has already been shown, a person wishing to
avail himself of the forfeiture of a claim in the actual
possession of another has no right to take forcible
possession of such claim, or to mark it out as virgin
ground, but must proceed in the ordinary course of
law and obtain the adjudication of the Warden in his
favor (a).
But the authority of Critchley v. Graham does not i
apply in every case where a person has been in
possession. It does not mean that in every case where
a person was in possession a miner seeking to avail
himself of a forfeiture must first go before the Warden
before he can mark out. It applies only where the
person in possession has a strong primd facie title (6).

Procedure.

Right to enforce

Miner’s right.
Proceedings to enforce forfeiture may be taken in
the Court of Mines (c) or before the Warden ( cl), as
the Act under which Gritchley v. Graham was decided
(e) is not in this respect distinguishable from the Act
No. 291 [No. 1120, Part I] (f).
However, as before mentioned, this principle will
not apply to cases of actual abandonment. The title
to a claim is based on possession, and a right origin-
ating in possession terminates with the cesser of
possession ( g ). Where there is ade facto abandon-
ment there is no necessity for the Warden’s adjudica-
tion ; it is only in cases of constructive abandonment
and forfeiture, whether by illegal occupation or
otherwise, that the principle's of Gritchley v. Graham
applies ( h).
* The right to enforce forfeiture is a public right
belonging to no particular individual until he has
proceeded in a proper court tp enforce his share of it
to which his title then first accrued, and which he
could enforce subject to the condition of then holding
a miner’s right (i).
But it is not necessary that a person seeking to
enforce forfeiture should have a miner’s right at the
time when the forfeiture was incurred ; it is sufficient
if he has one when the complaint is made ( j ).

Neither is it necessary that he should hold a miner’s
right before the repeal of i by-law under which the
breach causing forfeiture was incurred, provided he is
the holder of a miner’s right when he seeks to enforce
the forfeiture (k).
After the repeal of a by-law, however, the question
of alleged subsequent forfeiture of a claim must be
determined according to the by-law under which the
claim was registered, notwithstanding its subsequent
repeal (I).
A person holding a full claim under one miner’s
right need not have a second miner’s right (m) to
enable him to enforce forfeiture of another claim (n),
as the by-laws in question authorise the holder of one
miners right to take up seVeral single men’s claims
under it.
It is imperative on the Warden in cases of for-
feiture, and in all cases under the Act No. 291, sec.
195 [No. 1120, sec. 237], in which he finds the com-
plainant to be entitled as against the defendant to
make an order putting the complainant in possession
(o). He has no discretion in the matter, and his
adjudication of forfeiture or abandonment will enure
only to the party in whose favor it is made, and it
cannot be taken advantage of by others (p).

Effect of
Warden’s
adjudication.
Adjudication
complainant,
A person obtaining a decree of forfeiture of the
claim of another on the ground of non-compliance
with the by-laws does not, however, thereby acquire a
title for himself, but merely removes a prior title; and
therefore in taking possession under the Warden’s
order he must comply with the ordinary preliminary
conditions of marking out under the by-laws if he
would acquire a title for himself (q), unless the
by-laws under which the claim is so acquired dispense
with such preliminary conditions, and authorise
registration of the claim forthwith after adjudication
(r). And on the same principle a person obtaining an
adjudication of forfeiture and possession has priority
of title in pursuance of such adjudication, if he
proceeds to obtain possession by marking and regis-
tration of the claim (s).
Thus, a third person, or a defendant whose title has
' been defeated, cannot by prior marking immediately
after the Warden’s adjudication in favor of a com-
plainant obtain legal possession of the claim as against
the complainant by reason of such marking. The
priority of title enures to the complainant in whose
favor the adjudication was made, and is a valid title
as soon as he has marked out and registered the
claim ; and a stranger or the defendant cannot fly in
the face of the Warden’s order and obtain title by
marking out immediately the prior titles have been
cleared away by the Warden’s order, and before the
complainant who has obtained the order has had an
opportunity of taking advantage of it by marking
out ( t ).

Forfeiture may be enforced for breach of a by-law
which was repealed subsequent to such breach, where
the repealing by-law saved existing rights (u), and
proceedings may be taken and forfeiture declared
after the neglect or omission the cause of forfeiture
has ceased, notwithstanding the claimholder may have
resumed work on the claim (v).
The persons by whom and the manner in which a
forfeiture may be taken advantage of are to be deter-
mined by the by-laws in existence at the time the
forfeiture is attempted to be enforced (w) ; and if a
by-law enacts a forfeiture, but omits to point out the
person who may enforce it, such forfeiture may be
enforced by any holder of a miner’s right (x). And
where a by-law (y) provides that a claim shall be
forfeitable for non-working, and that it may be by a
competent court declared forfeited, the Warden has no
discretionary power to refrain from ordering for-
feiture and putting the complainant in possession,
should the circumstances appear to him sufficient to
warrant such a decision as being equitable (z), as he is
the person having jurisdiction by law in the matter,
and as persona designata need not be specially men-
tioned in the by-law.
Forfeiture of a claim is ndt confined to the interest
under the then existing miner’s right, as the title is in
the nature of a permanent estate, and' such title is

A person establishing a forfeiture does not neces-
sarily take the same claim as the person whose title
he impugns (b). He may wish to take a lesser area,
or to include in his claim some additional ground, and
he is at liberty to occupy other adjoining ground
together with the claim adjudged forfeited, if the
whole area taken is not in excess of that allowed by
the by-laws (c). But a person taking possession under
the Warden’s adjudication of forfeiture of more
ground than he is entitled to occupy may be limited
to his proper quantity by the Warden’s order, and the
entire title will not be avoided by the excess ( d ).
This, however, was an opinion expressed by Moles-
worth, Chief Judge, where the facts were not
discussed (e).
Pendency of an appeal against the Warden’s dis-
missal of a complaint for! forfeiture will not affect
proceedings to obtain a declaration of forfeiture taken
by a third party pending the appeal (/) ; and pend-
ency of an application for a lease does not prevent the
Warden from making an order for possession in favor
of the complainant of the land included in such
application, should he declare the claim forfeited,

by him of the forfeiture of the lease, and he will be
entitled to an adjudication of forfeiture ( h ).
A shareholder or director in an incorporated com-
pany is not precluded fropa enforcing forfeiture of a
claim incurred by the company for breach of the
by-laws ( i ); and a director of a company, whilst act-
ing as a director, acquiring the knowledge of the
defendant’s want of a miner’s right, is not estopped
by his position as a director from enjoying the same
privileges as the rest of the public have, after he has
ceased to be a director and has severed his connection
with the company (j). tWe cannot say that any
principle of equity is actually violated by one of
several shareholders endeavoring to forfeit for his

formed the subject matter of an association ” (k).

will be bad on the ground of champerty, though the
other person may be a general mining partner of the
complainant (I). Where a complainant in a suit for
forfeiture admitted on cross-examination that another
person had joined with him in advancing money for
the purpose of the suit, and was to have a share in
the claim if recovered, it was held to present the
objection of champerty and maintenance, and the suit
was dismissed. “The plaintiff has no right except
one which can be acquired by litigation, and the
inception of that litigation was through a bargain
contrary to public policy ” (m).
t And it is not necessary, in order to constitute
' champerty, that there should be a binding contract
between the parties, which apart from its illegality
would be valid. But where a plaintiff has a good
title, he is not to be defeated on the ground merely
of remunerating the attorney whom he employs;
though where plaintiffs solicitor had paid the
expenses of the suit, and takewout miners rights, and
was to have half of each of the plaintiff’s interest in
the land when recovered, it was held that the proceed-
ings were in their inception and concoction based upon
champerty and maintenance, and the suit was dis-
missed (n).
The by-laws in some cases of forfeiture permit of a
fine being inflicted in lieu :>f forfeiture of the claim.

had fallen into technical errjbrs only, it was held that J
a fine might properly be inflicted in lieu of forfeiture,
though it would not be permitted where the claim- 1
holder had been guilty of aggravated neglect ( q ).
A third person is not entitled to take up a claim
pending the decision of thj Chief Judge [Supreme
Court] on a special case in respect of the same ground,
for the inchoate rights of a complainant under a
complaint for forfeiture aref not to be obstructed by
the right to a special case given by the Act No. 446,
sec. 22 [No. 1120, sec. 265] to the defendant (r).
A summons for forfeiture before the Warden must
allege distinctly the grounds on which the forfeiture
is sought, and the by-laws which have not been com-
plied with (s), and the safne principle applies to a
summons for being in illegal occupation ( t ). The
Warden has jurisdiction in all cases of forfeiture under
the by-laws though he may not be named as the
person to adjudge a forfeiture in the by-law under
which the forfeiture is sought (u), as he is the proper
officer to hear and determine the complaint, and
derives his jurisdiction from The Mines Act.
The withdrawal of one of a number of complainants
does not defeat the others, und they may have their
share of the land recovered jas if there had been no
such withdrawal (v).

INTERESTS IN GOLD MINING
LEASES.
CHAPTER I.
GOLD MINING LEASES.
Any Crown land not already held under a gold-
mining lease or miner’s right or business license may
be applied for, and the Crown may grant to any per-
son or elective body corporate, subject to The Mines
Act and to the leasing regulations, a lease of such
land to be effectual for gold mining on or below or
both on and below the surface ( a ).
The area authorised to be taken in a gold-mining
lease is not less than one acre, nor more than thirty
acres, and in the case of a lode not less than one

hundred yards nor more than six hundred yards along
, the course of the lode and the width not less than
- twenty yards nor more than two hundred yards
the lode ( b ). If a larger or less area he
applied for the Warden cannot proceed with the
enquiry into the application unless he shall receive
the direction of the Minister of Mines to that effect,
in accordance with reg. 4.
A gold-mining lease is not a claim (c). The inter-
pretation clause of The Mines Act declares that a
claim shall not include any land comprised in any
lease granted for mining purposes (cl).
The title acquired by means of a gold-mining lease is
separate and distinct from any other title, and is
obtained by application made for it under regulations
made by the Governor-in-Council in pursuance of The
Mines Act (e) ; and the granting or refusal of the
lease is entirely in the discretion of the Governor (/).
The term of a gold-mining lease may not exceed
fifteen years from the time of granting it (<j), and so
long as the covenants of such lease are complied with
the lessee may enjoy the land demised during such
term without interference.
The labor covenants of a lease, i.e. the covenants by
which the lessee binds himself to keep employed on
the leased ground a certain number of men, are the

real consideration given for the granting of such lease,
for the rent is merely nominal; and therefore such
covenants will be strictly construed. “The testing
and opening of new ground by means of a stipulated
amount of labor employed is the value given by the
lessee to the Crown in return for the exclusive right
to mine on a portion of the public lands supposed to,
be auriferous. This covenant, therefore, ought to be
strictly construed, and a lessee has no ground of com-
plaint if the performance of it be rigorously en-
forced ” ( h).
An applicant for a gold mining lease acquires no
title to the land until the lease is granted. He is not
entitled to mine on the land before the granting of
the lease, though he has power to prevent other
people mining on it. If he does mine he is regarded as
an unauthorised trespasser on public property (i) ; and
the Gazette notice of a forfeiture under regs. 44-47 of
O 9
1875 [regs. 53-58 of 1890] and of an intention to
grant a lease to the applicant for such forfeiture will
not entitle such applicant to mine on the land in
expectation of his lease being obtained as against
another person who has marked out the land and
applied for a lease of it (j) ; and a person who
obtains a Crown grant of land of which a mining
lease has been previously granted cannot mine on it,
or authorise others to mine on it, during the currency
of the lease ( k) ; and d fortiori, such land cannot be
applied for under The Mining on Private Property
Act (I) during the term of the existing lease.

Prior occupation
under miner's
right.
No person other than the leaseholder has a right to
mine on land held under gold mining lease from the
Crown, as the lease passes everything to the lessee.
The holder of a miner’s right has no authority to
search for auriferous quartz or to prospect on the
leased land (m), for a mming lease having been
granted gives to the lessee the exclusive privilege of
mining on the leased land, |md any entry by other
miners is a trespass so long as the lease remains valid.
And so, where a creek wiith full and free access
thereto was reserved in a gold-mining lease of land
which included part of the creek, and the holder of a
miner’s right took up portion of the creek as a claim,
it was held that the occupation under miner’s right
was illegal, and that, as between the parties, the creek
was protected from occupation, such occupation not
being based on any legal proceeding; and quaere,
whether the holder of a miner’s right could obtain
possession by legal proceeding|s (n).
But a gold-mining lease, even if granted, will not
be effectual as against the holder of a miner’s right in
lawful possession of the leased land at the time of the
granting of the lease , and a pertificate of title under
The Transfer of Land Statute of the leased land in
the name of the lessee, purporting only to grant the
land, does not include a “mine” or “claim” held under
miner’s right at the date of the lease, but only the
surface above such mine or claim (o). The claim-
holder is not bound to resist the granting of the
lease, but he is entitled to do so, and he may protect

himself against the lease when granted by showing his
lawful title (p), and his not objecting to the granting
of the lease will not invalidate his title previously
acquired. If a gold-mining lease be granted by the
Crown comprising land at the time of the demise
lawfully occupied by the holder of a miner’s right,
who lias not assented to the lease, such lease is void
quoad the land so occupied, and no proceedings to set
it aside are necessary (q).
The holder of a claim may if he choose apply for a
lease of the land held by him under miner’s right, or
any part of it, or may include it in an application fojy
a lease of other adjoining ground. But when the
holder of a claim applies jfor and obtains a lease of
part of the ground comprised in his claim, it will be
presumed that he has abandoned any portion of the
portion of the original claim which is not included in
parcels of the lease (r). “If the holder of a claim under
miner’s right consider it aivisable to abandon that
title and obtain a lease, he may do so ; and any lease
granted to any other person is subject to his right, so
that he, although the holder (of a mere licence, and of
no estate at all, is put in a higher position than the
holder of a lease ” (s).
An applicant for a gold-mining lease must, if pos- (
sible, obtain the consent in writing of all persons
having any interest in the land applied for (t) ; ayd

enter upon the land in pursuance of such adjudication,
and remaining on and actually working it. “ This
clause (Act No. 291, s. 37) restricts the right which
persons would otherwise have to take up after an
application for a lease, and makes them provisional
trespassers subject to the fate of the application, and
I think by necessary implication subjects them to

and though it was formerly held that a mining lease
could not give the right to mine under the half of a
o . ~
road which had previously become private property
by virtue of a Crown grant conveying the land
abutting on it (h), yet it was subsequently held by
the Full Court that property in the soil ad medium
filum vice in a public street, road, or highway in
Victoria cannot be, and never has been, created merely
by a grant from the Crown of the land adjoining such
street, road, or highway, tHe property of which
remains in the Crown (i).
Nevertheless the local municipality, being the body
having control of a road or street, is entitled to

receive notice of an application for a gold mining
lease of such road (j), and the consent of such muni-
cipality must be obtained l|y the applicant for the
lease if he desires to break tlje surface of the road or

In a proceeding before justices for disturbing the
soil of a street the defendant claimed the soil of the
street under a mining lease, and contended that the
jurisdiction of the justices was ousted, a claim of title
being involved. It was helfl that the objection was
not tenable the only question for the justices to
decide was whether the place was a street or not ( k ).

The applicant for a lease not be the holder of
a miners right. Where a plaintiff company joined
with its trustees in a suit for encroachment on its
leased land, and also upon its block claim, and miners’
rights were produced by the trustees but not by the
company, it was held that the company was entitled
to succeed in respect of the leased land, but not as to
the claim, the miners’ rights being insufficient as to
the latter (I).
After the expiration of a lease by effluxion of time,
acceptance of rent by the Crown does not confer any
new title on the lessee (m) ; but quaere whether such
acceptance of rent during the currency of a lease
would not avoid a forfeiture for breach of the labor
covenants incurred previous io such acceptance (n).
In order to determine aj gold mining lease the
Crown must take some step I beyond simply declaring
it void. Until such a step is taken the lessee remains
entitled, as between it and individuals, to keep posses-
sion, and to mine and retain the proceeds of mining
and to maintain a suit for trespass against persons
trespassing. Land liable to 4e forfeited, and declared
to be forfeited, but still in thb possession of a tenant,
cannot be forcibly taken from him by a stranger.
Thus, A was the'lessee from the Crown of a gold
mining lease which contained a proviso for forfeit-
ure in case of breach of covenants, and the lease was
by Gazette notice declared tb be forfeited, but the
Crown did not re-enter or take possession. The
defendant company was mining on the land under
color of its having taken possession of it under miner’s

filed a hill against the company to restrain it from

was held by the Full Court (Williams J. clissentiente),
affirming Higinbotham J., that as the lease was not
forfeited merely by the declaration in the Gazette, A
was entitled to maintain the suit, and an injunction
was granted, and an account directed (o).
\
A lessee accepting and executing a lease, a covenant
of which was ultra vires The Mining Statute 1865
[Mines Act Part I.], is nevertheless bound by such
execution from objecting to it, and cannot at the same
time insist that the lease is effectual to pass the estate
to him, and ineffective as providing for its termina-
tion, on the ground that he took the lease which the
Governor might grant or withhold, and which he had
no right to insist on, and then reject the terms it
imposed. And a certificate of title under The Trans-
fer of Land Stat ute (p) of j leasehold land obtained on
transfer of a mining lease, although made paramount
by sec. 49 [No. 1149, sec. 74] of that Act, does not
defeat the right of the Crown to determine the
estate ( q ).
The Crown cannot grant a reversionary lease to a
person applying for a new ease during the currency
of a former one under set. 34 of the Act No. 291
[No. 1120, sec. 62], and sec. 1 of the Act No. 446 [No.

(r). I£ the lessee desires to obtain a renewal of his
lease he must apply for it in the ordinary way after
the expiration of his current lease.
A person holding a lease for which he is virtually a
trustee for a company, though he may not have trans-
ferred the lease to the company, will be declared to be
a trustee only. And this will apply to assignees of
the company, or to purchasers of the company’s
effects from the sheriff under execution. Thus, where
three persons, holding a gold mining lease in their
own names, formed a company which worked the
ground, but the lease was never transferred to the
company, and plaintiff obtained a judgment against
the company, and at the sheriff’s sale under the exe-
cution bought the interest of the company in the
lease, it was held that the lessees were trustees for
the plaintiff, and should transfer the lease to him (s).
A purchaser a±sD at a sheriff’s sale of all the property
of a company would be entitled to a lease granted
subsequently to the purchase to a person who applied
for it as trustee for the company before the
purchase ( t).
Under the leasing regulations of 1871 (cl. 28) if the
applicant failed to execute the lease within sixty days
after the day of the date of the Gazette in which a
notice that the lease was ready for execution by the
lessee had been published, the lease was deemed void.
And this from whatever cause the default arose.
Thus, after the granting of a gold mining lease to the
manager of a company, who died before executing it,
application was made by his successor to the Minister

of Mines for permission to execute the lease in his
stead. Such permission was not granted within
sixty days after the Gazette notice that the lease was
ready for execution, and proceedings were taken by the
holder of a miner’s right before the Warden to be put
in possession of the land as being in illegal occupation
of the company. It was held that the lease was
deemed void under reg. 28 of 1871, and that the
Warden might so regard it, and that there was no
legal or equitable interest in the representatives of
the deceased lessee to make them necessary parties (u).
However, by the amending leasing regulations of
Nov. 4, 1889 (v) unless the applicant execute the
lease within sixty days from the date of the publica-
tion in the Gazette of a notification that the lease is
awaiting execution, the Governor-in-Council may
immediately after the expiration of the period declare
the lease void. The lease is not void, but merely
voidable at the discretion of the Governor-in-
Council.
The yearly rent payable in respect of a gold-mining
lease of Crown land is five shillings for every acre

CHAPTER II.
APPLICATION FOR GOLD MINING LEASES.
SECTION I.—REQUIREMENTS PRELIMINARY TO
GRANTING OF LEASES.
Having considered the subject of gold mining leases
generally we may now poiht out the means of apply-
ing for a lease of Crown land not already demised and
not occupied by the holder of a miner’s right. The
regulations made by tf e Governor-in-Council in
pursuance of The Mines Act prescribe the procedure
(a), and these regulations are to be strictly complied
with in every particular.
The requirements of the leasing regulations pre-
liminary to the application are contained in reg. 5 ;
and these requirements must be complied with within
seven days previous to lodging the application with
the Warden; the calculation of “days” is exclusive
of Sundays, Good Friday and Christmas Day. (reg.
1).

2. Advertising
notice OF
APPLICATION.
1. The first preliminary requirement (reg. 5 (a) ) is
marking out the land by erecting posts painted white,
not less than 2ft. 6in. above the ground, as far as
circumstances and occupiers will permit, to define
accurately the boundaries and angles of the land
applied for, with a metal plate thereon having painted
the words “ applied for lease ” and the name of the
applicant, or (if more than two) of the first two
applicants, legibly painted thereon ; and such posts
are to be kept so erected and painted, or replaced if
removed or torn down, until the termination of the
proceedings under the regulations.
The time of the marking out will date from the
time when the requirements of the regulation have
been fully completed. Thus, where an applicant put
in posts on Feb. 18, but did not paint them white or
put on metal plates as required until the 21st, the
marking out was held to date from the 21st (b). The
marking out is directed by sec. 37 of the Act Not 291
[No. 1120, sec. 65] as the first proceeding of the
applicant for a lease, and reg. 5 (a) must be complied
with in every respect before the land is legally marked
out (c).
2. The second preliminary requirement (reg. 5 (b) )
is the insertion in a newspaper published in the
district in which the land is situated, or if no such
newspaper, then in one published nearest to the land,
of an advertisement or notice in the form prescribed by
the regulations (d). The forms of this notice can be
obtained from every office of the Warden, and the
information required must be filled in concisely and
distinctly before the advertisement is inserted.

smith, 8 V.L.R. (M.) 14, 3 A.L.

(c) Hutcheson v. Erk, 3 V.L.R.
(M.) 1.
(d) Sched. A, “Noticeof appli-
cation for a mining lease.”


3. The third requirement (reg. 5 (c)) is to post notices
similar to the foregoing at the office of the Warden,
and at the post office or police court, whichever shall
appear to the applicant to be nearest to the land by
the ordinary road.
Not posting the notice at the Warden’s office is a
default in the application, and the Warden’s office
referred to in the regulations as the place at which
notices must be posted is not the court or place where
he sits as judge, but the principal place from which he
issues his summonses and orders (e).
Under the leasing regulations of 1871 it was held
that the post office or police court at which the notice
is required to be posted must be that nearest to the
land, but by reg. 5 (c) of the regulations of 1890 it is
that which shall appear to be nearest by the ordinary
road, and not necessarily the one most easily accessible
(/)-. If there be any doubt which of two post offices
is nearest to the land, it is a wise precaution to post a
copy of the notice at each.
4. The next requirement (reg. 5 (d)) is to give to
every person apparently occupying or having or
claiming to the knowledge of the applicant to have
any rights on or under the land, or any part thereof,
a similar notice, the mode of service of which is
prescribed by the regulation. In applying for a lease
of a public road notice must be served on the munici-
pality or body having control of such road, as being a
body having a right or interest in the land applied
for. ( I*.*

permit.
The applicant must state in his notice of applica-
tion who is in occupation of the land (g) ; and not
serving notice on an occupier of the land, or any part
of it, will constitute a default in the application.
When the occupier is a company, service of the notice
on the manager, who takes it and retains it as served
on the company, is sufficient service ( h ).
* !
But service of notice on an occupier was held
insufficient where effected by thrusting the notice
under the door of the dwelling of such occupier,
unless the applicant can show on the enquiry before
the Warden that it reached the person intended to be
served. But see now reg. 5 (d) as to mode of service.
The onus of proof of service of the notice is on the
applicant, and an omission to properly serve notice on
occupiers of the ground applied for is a default
within the meaning of the Act No. 446, s. 4 [No.
1120, sec. 71] (7).
A person who has taken up part of a road under
his miner’s right in accordance with sec. 16 of the
Act No. 291 [No. 1120, sec. 19], and has obtained a
permit to mine on it from the local municipality, is a
person in lawful occupation, and is entitled to be
served with notice by any person applying for a lease
of such road after the permit is applied for and before
it is granted, and omission to serve such an occupier
is a default in the application (j).

As it is necessary that the names of all occupiers
within the knowledge of the applicant must be
inserted in the notice, an applicant for a lease should
take care to ascertain who are the real occupiers
before drawing up the notice; for if a person be
named as an occupier who is not in fact an occupier,
it is assumed he must receive notice, for it has been
held that the list of occupiers published by the
applicant in his notice of application is evidence
against him that the persons named are occupiers (/;),
and by implication that they should all be served.
5. The next requirement (reg. 5 (e)) is the payment to
the clerk of the Warden, or if no such clerk to the
clerk of petty sessions nearest to the land, of the
necessary fee, and the applicant must in addition to
the deposit (reg. 5 (f)), if required by the Warden,
pay a sufficient fee to cover the cost of survey, in
accordance with the scale in schedule C of the regula-
tions.
The fee required for survey is prescribed as such
further sum or sums as may be considered necessary
by the Warden ; and non-payment within seven days
prior to making the application of a sum of money to
cover the cost of surveying interior lines, and then
connecting them with the nearest fixed point, is a
default in proceeding with the application within sec.
4 of the Act No. 446 [No. 1120, sec. 71] (I).
6. The applicant must also (reg. 6) if able to do so
previous to lodging the application obtain from the
occupiers of the land or from any persons having or
claiming to the knowledge of the applicant to have

any rights therein and willing to give the same a
written consent duly witnessed to the application
being granted ; and any occupier not willing to give
such consent is at liberty to object to the application
(reg. 6). These written consents, if obtained, are
annexed to the declaration of the applicant or put
in evidence at the enquiry before the Warden, and are
forwarded by him with his report to the Minister of
Mines.
Though an occupier refusing his consent is at
liberty to object to the lease being granted as regards
the portion occupied by him, a person in legal occupa-
tion of the ground under his miner’s right is not
bound to do so, and a lease of land occupied by virtue
of a miner’s right is invalid as to such ground, unless
the consent of such occupier to the granting of the
lease has been obtained (m). Thus, where a number
of persons, holders of miner’s rights and equally
interested in a claim, appoint one of their number to
apply for a lease of the ground on behalf of the
whole of them, the written consent of the others to
the application should neverthless be obtained, as they
are all occupiers, and something beyond the statement
of the applicant will be required to show that he is a
trustee for, or that he sufficiently represents, all the
owners of the claim.
The registered holder of a claim, though only
trustee for others as the manager of a company, can
without the authority of his cestuis que trustent give
a valid consent to a portion of his claim being
included in a lease, and the consent of the benefi-
ciaries is not necessary (n).

Having complied with the preliminaries, the appli-
cation itself is then made under reg. 7. This must be
lodged with the Warden within seven days after the
advertisement has appeared in the newspaper, and pre-
sumably may be lodged immediately all the preliminaries
are complied with. To tljie application must be appended
a statutory declaration of the applicant in the form of
schedule F showing how the preliminary requirements
have been complied with by him or his agent; and
the newspaper advertisement, receipts for deposits and
consents of occupiers must be annexed thereto as
exhibits (reg. 7). The Warden then directs the
mining surveyor to survey and make a plan of the
land (reg. 10) and should no objection to the applica-
tion be lodged within ten days after the posting of
the surveyor’s notice under reg. 12, the applicant is
not required (unless directed by the Minister) to
attend at any further enquiry, and no court of
enquiry will be held by the Warden unless required
by the Minister, but the whole of the papers and the
statutory declaration and exhibits will be forwarded
to the Minister by the Warden together with his
report and recommendation (reg. 15).
The Minister may, however, require that a court of
enquiry be held, notwithstanding that no objection be
made to the application {teg. 16).
Should any person object to the application being
granted the Warden will in due course hold a court of
enquiry, of which notice is given by him to the
applicant and others interested, to take evidence and
hear objections (reg. 17 et seq). This court of enquiry
is open to the public and the mode of conducting the
business of the court is in the discretion of the
Warden (reg. 19). If, however, the area applied for be
greater or less than prescribed by reg. 2, the Warden

cannot proceed with the 'enquiry unless specially
directed to do so by the Minister of Mines (reg. 4).
This direction must be applied for by the applicant
for the lease not later than the third day after the
application has been lodged with the Warden. As
soon as the evidence is taken by the Warden (on the
expiration of three days after the adjournment of the
court of enquiry), he transmits to the Minister of
Mines the application, plan, report of the mining
surveyor, consents of occupiers, objections (if any),
evidence written and documentary, and all other
writings relating to the application, together with his
observations and opinion thereon (reg. 20).
Any person objecting to the application for a lease
must within the time prescribed by the regulations
lodge with the Warden and serve upon the applicant,
or if more than two then upon any two named in the
application, at his or their address as stated in the
notice, a statement in writing of the grounds of his
objection. This service may be personal or by posting
the notice of objection to the address stated in the
application in a registered letter. No particular form
of objection is required, so long as it clearly shows
what application is objected to, the grounds of the
objection, and the address of the objector (reg. 13).
He must also (reg. 14) deposit with the clerk of the
Warden a sum of five pounds, which deposit, as also
the deposit of the applicant, is subject to the orders of
the Minister of Mines or of the Warden for payment
of costs (regs. 43, 44).
An applicant for a lease must be a person or
persons, or a corporation ; a contemplated company
cannot be an applicant (o), and a lease applied for by
(o) Aladdin O.M. Co. v. Alad-
din and Try Again O.M. Co.,

a person on behalf of a company which does not then
exist will, if granted, be granted to the applicant in
his own name, and not in that of the company.
SECTION lI.—GRANTING OR REFUSAL OF LEASES.
The Crown is not in any way bound to grant a
mining lease. Sec. 39 of The Mining Statute 1865
[ Na sec - 67] vests an arbitrary discretion in the
executive to grant or refuse an application for a lease,
and such discretion cannot be reviewed or controlled
by a court of justice.
No tribunal is provided iby the Act No. 291 [No.
1120] for entertaining the reasonableness or otherwise
of the reasons for refusing! a lease. It is the duty of
the Governor to inform the applicant of the reasons
for refusal of a lease, if refused, but there does not
appear to be any jurisdiction, by mandamus or other-
wise, to compel the performance of that duty. “It is
a class of questions which courts of justice are not
properly competent to entertain, involving a variety
of points, enquiries in a difficult department of
science, questions of publi 2 and private convenience,
and individual eligibility and ineligibility, which
couits of justice cannot enter into ” (a). Neither is
there anything in the Act No. 291, or the regulations
under it, to bind the Governor to follow the opinion
of the Warden as to granting or refusing a lease (6);

hility Act 1865 (c) will not lie against the Crown at
the suit of the holder of a mining claim to restrain
the issue to other parties of a lease of the land
occupied as such claim (d).
The Governor has no power to grant a lease to any
one hut the applicant. Thus, he is not warranted in
granting a lease to an alleged assignee of the applicant
against the protest of such applicant; in such a case
he can only refuse the lease (e). And the representa-
tives of a deceased applicant who died before the
execution of the lease within the time prescribed by
the regulations (reg. 28 of 1871--see reg. 33 of 1890)
have no legal or equitable interest in such lease, if
applied for by the applicant as manager of and on
behalf of a company (/).
,
Under sec. 39 of the Act Nd. 291 [No. 1120, sec.
07] the Governor has power to grant a lease notwith-
standing that the applicant may not in all respects
have complied with the leasing regulations. r lhis,
however, relates to waiving objections before execu-
tion by the Governor, and not before execution by the
lessee. After execution by the Governor, and before
execution by the lessee, the lease according to the
regulations operates by way of escrow. If such regu-
lations are ultra vires sec. 43 [No. 1120, sec. 77], the
lease is altogether inoperative ( g ).

SECTION 111 .—THE EFFECT OF THE ACT NO. 446,
SS. 3, 4 [NO. 1120, SS. 70, 71].
The Act passed to amend The Mining Statute 1865
(ti) has had the effect of materially altering the posi-
tion between persons marking as for a lease, and persons
marking as for a claim. It was held in the case of
Perkins v. Hercules Co. (hi) that an application for a
lease did not exempt the ground from forfeiture other-
wise incurred under the operation of the by-laws;
and the application for a lease by a claimholder of
the ground comprised in his claim did not under sec.
87 of the Act No. 291 [No. 1120, sec. 65] protect the
claim from forfeiture incurred either before or after
the application on the ground of abandonment or
breach of a by-law (c), for the concluding words of
section 87 [6s] show that all that is meant is
that no taking up is good as against the lessee. The
protection afforded by the application was only quoad
the applicant for the lease, and the application for a
lease did not prevent any person taking up the
ground as a claim under miner’s right. In case the
lease should be granted, the lessee could proceed for
trespass and restitution of the gold taken out of the
leased ground (d). Thus, under sec. 87 [No. 1120,
sec. 65] trespass by marking out ground pending an
application for a lease is not a trespass against the
whole world, but only against the applicant for the
lease, and a third party cannot take advantage
of it ( e ).

Bain v. McColl.
Trespass under
No. 291, s. 37.
The case of Bain v. McColl (/), which was decided
before the passing of the Act No. 446, serves to show
the position as between a claimholder and an appli-
cant for a lease, with regard to sec. 37 of the Act No.
291 [No. 1120, sec. 65]. Defendant, who was the
holder of a miner’s right, on August 10, 1871, applied
for a lease of his claim and other ground, and
obtained the recommendation of the Warden that it
should issue. The plaintiff then, on March 1, 1872,
obtained a decision of abandonment by the Warden,
marked out the land as a claim, and sunk a shaft on
it. Defendant summoned him for trespass pending
the application for the lease, and the judge of the
Court of Mines decided against him (the applicant), as
he had failed to comply with the leasing regulations.
Some months afterwards, on October 28, 1872, the
Governor executed the lease, and it was executed on
November 18 following, by the defendant, who there-
upon forcibly ejected the plaintiff, who then sued
defendant tor trespass. It was held that sec. 37 of
the Act No. 291 [No. 1120, sec. 65] explained sec. 24
[No. 1120, sec. 49] so as to make a person intruding
on the ground pending the application liable if the
lease were afterwards granted, yet he would not be so
if the applicant had made default in complying with
the leasing regulations, but that it was not necessary
that the applicant should sue every intruder before
taking the lease ; it would be sufficient if the latter
were liable before the lease was issued ; and further,
that though sec. 39 [No. 1120, sec. 67] authorised the
Governor to issue leases when there has not been full
compliance with the leasing regulations, this quali-
fies the restriction in sec. 24 [No. 1120, sec. 49] against
granting leases to persons not complying with the
regulations as between them and the Crown or the
(/) 4 A..J.R. 62. SA.J.R. 17.


public, but does not so qualify sec. 37 [No. 1120,
sec. 65] as to making a person having a lawful title
before the lease lose his title and be made a trespasser
retrospectively (g).
An applicant for a lease taking proceedings against
a trespasser pending the decision of his application
was bound under sec. 37 to prove compliance with all
the regulations in force respecting his application (h) ;
and this will apply as well under the Act No. 446 (i).
The Act No. 446, passed on December 17, 1872,
however, provides that pending any application for a
lease or license under the provisions of the Act No.
291 [No. 1120, Part I.] it shall not be lawful to mark
out as a claim, or to include within the boundaries of
any claim, the land applied for, or any part thereof,
and no such marking out shall confer any right or
title to the said land; and any person who shall enter
upon such land for the purpose of marking out the
same shall be deemed to have trespassed or encroached
thereon within the meaning of sec. 37 of the Act No.
291 [No. 1120, sec. 65] (») ; and the pendency of an
application shall begin ydth the marking out of tie-
land by the applicant, and continue until the applicant
make default in proceeding with his application in
accordance with the leasing regulations (/,:), or until

the Governor grant or refuse the application (I). But
any applicant for a lease of land consisting wholly or
in part of a claim may purchase such claim and work
the same as a claim pending the application (m).
Thus, though under the, Act No. 291, secs. 24—37
[No. 1120, secs. 49—65] marking out for a lease did
not stop the power of acquiring title to a claim by
marking out, except as to the rights of those pre-
viously marking for a leasq (n), yet the Act No. 446,
secs. 3, 4 [No. 1120, secs. 70,171], passed since the deci-
sion of Barker s G.M. Go. v r Keating (n) was given,
meets the case, and makes marking out for a claim
pending the application for a lease ineffectual for all
purposes (o). There would to have been some
doubt as to whether marking out a claim on land a
lease of which had been applied for could be deemed
an entry on, or interference with, such land within
the meaning of sec. 37 of tl]e Act No. 291 [No. 1120,
sec. 65]. If not, the first part of sec. 3 of the Act
No. 446 [No. 1120, sec. 70] Was not required at all,
though no doubt this section was passed to meet the
case, and resolve any doubt ufpon the point (p).
Thus, section 3 of the amending Act [No. 1120, sec.
70] prohibits all means of acquiring a claim whilst
the defendants are applicants I for a lease of the same
ground (q), but does not prohibit the Warden from
making an order putting complainant in possession as
against a defendant pending an application by a third

party for a lease (r) ; nor as against the applicant for
the lease, hut in such case the complainant will be
left to meet the liabilities for trespass in marking out
contained in the section ; that is, the liability to be
declared a trespasser unless default in the application
can be shown (s).
In order to constitute a trespass under sec. 3 [No.
1120, sec. 70] it is not necessaty that a person entering
on the land subject of the application for a lease
should work or mine on it; the fact of entering to
mark out constitutes a trespass. The latter words of
the section have the effect of making it clear that a
mere entry for marking out, without occupying or
otherwise interfering with the land so as to cause
actual damage, should be a Cause of action for tres-
pass before the Warden ( t) ; but when such land is
marked out as a claim, it is necessary for the appli-
cant for a lease of the land to prove compliance with
the leasing regulations prior to the marking out
under the miner’s right. If a default in the applica-
tion be proved, the marking out for a claim will be
good as against the application for the lease (it).
However, though a person is prohibited from
entering on and marking opt for a claim land the
subject of an application foil a lease without being-
deemed a trespasser, he may proceed against a claim-
holder applying for a lease of his claim, for forfeiture
of the ground as a claim, and though under secs. 3, 4
of the Act No. 446 [No. 1120| secs. 70, 71] an applica-
tion for a lease is sufficient to prevent an order of
forfeiture for non-working, unless default in com-

plying with the leasing regulations be shewn ( v ), and
though the Warden should not pending the applica-
tion for the lease put persoijs in possession, he should
not dismiss the complaint, but adjourn from time to
time under Act No. 291, sec. 180 [No. 1120, sec. 219]
until the question of granting or refusal of the lease
is decided, and he has jurisdiction to grant an injunc-
tion against mining until the application for the lease
is disposed of ( w ).
An application for a lease is therefore only a
provisional title. If the leade is refused it is just the
same as if the application hail not been made ( x ), and
the Warden can then put a complainant in possession
in the same manner as if a default in the application
had been proved.
A title obtained in contravention of sec. 3 of the
Act No. 446 [No. 1120, sec. 70] is bad. Where land
was marked out for a least, and was subsequently
marked out for a claim while the application for the
lease was pending, it was held that the holders of
miners’ rights suing for illegal occupation might insist
under sec. 3 [7o] that the title of the defendants was
bad, as obtained during the application for the lease,
even though the lease was ultimately refused (y).
It must be borne in mind that trespass under sec. 3
of the Act No. 446 [No. 1120, sec. 70] consists only of
entering to mark out the ground applied for under
lease as a claim, and therefore in proceeding for for-
feiture or illegal occupation before the Warden pend-
ing the application for a lease the section is not

contravened, inasmuch as parking out is not a con-
dition precedent to a proceeding before the Warden
( z ). As, however, marking out is necessary after the
Warden’s adjudication (a), even an order for posses-
sion will not authorise entry to mark out pending the
application for the lease, and thus a person obtaining
an adjudication of forfeiture cannot take possession
by marking. The refusal of the lease will, however,
enable the Warden to order forfeiture and possession,
and the complainant can then enter and mark out the
claim, his title being thus in abeyance pending the
granting or refusal of the lease.
SECTION IV.—PRIORITY OF LEASES.
Gold mining leases are granted according to priority
of application, which priority is determined according
to the time at which each application shall have been
received by the Warden as endorsed on the applica-
tions. If there are any reasons why priority should
be granted to one application lodged subsequently
to another the Governor is the sole arbiter, and it lies
in his absolute discretion which application, if any,
shall be granted (a). It is only in this latter manner
that priority of marking out can take precedence of
priority of application.
A person legally occupying under his miner’s right
land subject of an application for a lease has priority
of title over the application, unless he consent to such
application ; and mere taking possession by pegging
out a claim is good as against a person subsequently

and a party applying for a lease, a mistake made
by the applicant for the claim in his notice of appli-
cation, as to the time of taking possession, cannot be
taken advantage of by the applicant for the lease ( h).
In fact, the question of priority between one person
marking for a lease and another person marking for
a claim will not arise until all the preliminary
requirements are completed, and such priority will
date, as to the person marking for a lease, not from
the time when he pegged out the land, but from
the time when he has fully complied with the leasing
regulations as to painting the posts and affixing the
metal plates (c).
And where a person has no legal title, but is in
possession of Crown lands under his miner’s right,
O '
a lease of which has been applied for by others,
the title of the applicant for the lease remains in
abeyance until the lease is granted. If it is refused
the occupier may bring an action against the appli-
cant for trespass or encroachment committed during
the pendency of the application (d).
An applicant for a lease hjas no right to mine on
the land applied for before the lease is granted, and
any such mining is an unauthorised trespass on
public property. But the applicant may defend his
inchoate title, and may restrain other persons from
mining on the ground (e).

An application for a mining lease of land already
under lease, made in anticipation of the expiration
of the term of the current lease, is ineffectual. The
first step to he taken in applying for a lease is to
mark out the ground, and such marking during the
currency of an existing lease would be a trespass
on the leased land. And even were this done by
the lessee himself during his current lease, or with
his consent, the application for a new lease must be
refused, as the Crown cannot grant reversionary
leases applied for before the expiry of a current
lease (/). And of course this principle would apply
to a lessee marking out as seeking a renewal of
his lease ; neither before the passing of The Resi-
dence Areas Act 1881 ( g ) could the Crown grant a
lease of land comprised in a residence area previously
acquired, without the consent of the occupier (A).
SECTION V.—APPLICATION BY HOLDERS OF MINERS’
RIGHTS TO AVOID LEASES.
When a breach of the covenants or conditions of
a mining lease other than a reserved lands lease has
been committed by the lessee, any holder of a miner’s
right may apply to the Minister of Mines to have the
lease declared void, and a ease of the land issued to
the applicant (a). The mode of procedure is by an

• application to the Minister in the form set out in
- schedule O of the regulations, and the Minister may,
if he think fit, refer the application to the Warden
with directions to hold a public enquiry concerning
the alleged breach (reg. 53). The Warden is required
to give such notice to the parties as lie thinks neces-
sary, and proceeds on the day and at the place named
by him to hold an enquiry concerning the breach,
either ex parte or otherwise, and makes his report to
the Minister (reg. 54), forwarding with such report all
evidence taken on such enquiry, and his remarks on
the case.
These regulations are not ultra vires by reason that
they do not require a person pointing out a forfeiture
to mark out the ground as he would be required to do
in applying for a lease in the first instance under
the general regulations (6).
The Warden cannot determine a forfeiture, and put
the applicant in possession. All he has to do is to
enquire into the reality of the forfeiture or alleged
breach of covenant. If he finds that a breach has
been committed and a forfeiture incurred, and his
finding is affirmed by the Minister, the granting of
the lease applied for is a premium to the person
giving the information which leads to the forfeiture
(c). The object of the regulation is to prevent
“ shepherding ” leases, and as the Governor-in-Council
has authority to determine the matter of forfeiture
and of granting a lease to the apphcant, the granting
of a lease under these regulations is entirely within
his own discretion, and generally an equitable decision
may be looked for rather than a. strict legal judgment

as to the reality or otherwise of the forfeiture
incurred.
If the lease be declared void/ the former lessee may
at any time within forty days from the publication
of such forfeiture in the Gazette remove any plant,
machinery or tools belonging to him on the land, but
not timber used in and for Supporting any of the
shafts or drives in the mine (teg. 57).
The Warden is required t>o take evidence on the
enquiry before him respecting the value to the appli-
cant of any work done on or in or beneatli the leased
land, which in the opinion of the Warden is necessary
or available for future mining operations; and if the
lease is declared forfeited the applicant must pay such
ascertained value to the Warden for the former lessee.
But no compensation will be allowed for work or
labor done in the mine if it be proved that a con-
tinuous breach has been committed for a period of
twelve months previous to tile application (reg. 58).
SECTION VI.—LEASES OF RESERVED LANDS.

under lands granted or reserved for railways, water-
works, public parks, places of recreation, or other
public purposes (a) subject to the regulations made

Under the leasing regulations a person desiring to
obtain a mining lease of reserved lands must comply
with the requirements of reg. 5, except as to sub-
clause (a), and must address to the Governor and leave
with or forward to the Warden an application in
duplicate, in the prescribed form, having attached
thereto a statutory declaration and exhibits as in an
application for Crown lands, and also a plan of the
lands in which the mines are situated, showing the
7 O
position of the proposed shafts, and the position and
direction of the drives and other workings proposed
to be executed by the applicant for the purpose of
mining.
It will be noticed that in applying for a reserved
lands mining lease the Warden is not required to
authorise the mining surveyor to survey and make a
plan of the land (reg. 10). The survey and plan
required are not official, and must be made by some
surveyor (not necessarily the mining surveyor of the
district) by instructions of the applicant himself.
If there be no objection lodged the application is
dealt with as an ordinary unopposed application under
reg. 7. If however an objection be lodged under reg.
13 the Warden proceeds to hold an enquiry into the
application and any objections thereto in the same
manner as on an application for a gold mining lease of
Crown lands (reg. 7 et seq.), and transmits the evidence
taken by him, and his opinion thereon, to the Minister
of Mines (reg. 20). The evidence so taken is sub-
mitted to the Governor-in-Council, who alone in his
absolute discretion decides as to the granting or
refusal of the lease.


The form of application for a reserved lands raining
lease is prescribed by sched. E, and is different from
the form of application for an ordinary lease.
Land vested in the Board of Land and Works or
the railways commissioners cannot be applied for by
the holder of a miner’s right under reg. 53 upon
breach of the covenants or conditions of a gold
mining lease of such lands by the lessee.

SECTION I.—WHAT WILL CONSTITUTE FORFEITURE.
Every mining lease issued under the leasing regula-
tions contains a covenant on the part of the lessee
that he will use the leased land bond fide for the
purpose for which it has been demised, and a proviso
that if and whenever there shall be a breach of or non-
compliance with the covenants and provisions therein
contained by the lessee the Governor-in-Council, who
alone shall finally judge and determine the matter
upon the evidence or reports submitted by him by the
Minister of Mines, may declare the lease void (a);
and on publication in the Gazette of notice of such
declaration, all the right, title and interest of the
lessee shall cease and determine both at law and in
equity.
The time at which a Gazette notice operates is from
its being fully printed, not published, and a person

acting in anticipation of the publication, which is
subsequently confirmed, although he may not be
informed of it, is entitled to have the benefit of it (h).
However, a lease is made only voidable by the:
Crown for non-performance of the covenants in the
manner prescribed, and is not made void so that an
individual can claim to be put in possession (c).
In the well-known case of Barwick v. Duchess of
Edinburgh Co. (rZ) previously referred to, it was ques-
tioned whether recovery of possession by the Crown
was necessary to complete the forfeiture of a gold
mining lease, and Higinbotham J. held that section 42
of the Act No. 291 [No. 1120, sec. 75] contemplated
such recovery as necessary, even as regards the
Crown; and as regards the mining public, that
'recovery of possession by the Crown, or an adjudica-
tion of forfeiture, was an essential preliminary
condition to the power to mark out under miner’s

[ And on appeal it was held by the F ull Court
(Williams J. dissentients), affirming the decision of
’ Higinbotham J., that a declaration of forfeiture by
the Governor-in-Council by Gazette notice for breach
of labor covenants did not avoid the lease until some
person representing the Crown had taken some step

and of the lessee to possession, remained unchanged
until some act was done by the Crown to determine
the lease (e).
And payment of rent after breach of covenant is
binding on the Crown when accepted, although the
officer by whom the rent was received may have been
ignorant of breaches of covenant, or that the receipt
of the rent would waive a forfeiture. But receipt of
rent is not a waiver of continuing forfeitures (/).
But on forfeiture of a gold mining lease by Gazette
notice declaring such lease to be void, it is not com-
petent for any one other than the lessee to take the
objection that the lease is not actually determined
until re-entry by the Crown (g).
The publication of new leasing regulations will not
affect a lease issued under regulations which are
repealed by such new regulations, and the same
principle applies to leasing regulations as applies to
mining board by-laws, viz., that a lease is held under
the regulations under which it is granted, notwith-
standing their subsequent repeal. Thus, a gold
mining lease is not subject to regulations afterwards
published, so as to make notice of forfeiture under
such regulations evidence that the lessee has forfeited
his lease ( h ).

SECTION lI.—MEANS OF ENFORCING FORFEITURE.
Gold mining leases can only be declared void by the
Governor-in-Council (a), whose discretion in the
matter is absolute and unchallengable, and, as we have
seen, it is necessary that the Crown should take some
step to assert possession before' the forfeiture is
complete ( h), such as the drawing of the posts erected
by the lessee on his application by some duly autho-
rised person.
The power vested in the Governor of avoiding a
lease may be exercised—
1. During the progress of the application for the
lease, and before the execution of it by the Governor,
in which case the application may be declared aban-
doned.
2. After execution by the Governor and before
execution by the applicant, when the lease is declared
to be void, or
*
3. Where the applicant is stated to have abandoned,
or is to be deemed to have abandoned, his application,
or where the lease is void, or is to be deemed to be
void (reg. 35). See also reg. 59.
Under regulation 53 any hplder of a miner’s right
may apply for the land the subject of a gold mining
lease, not being a reserved lands lease, on a breach of
the covenants or conditions of such lease. The appli-
cation, which is enquired into by the Warden, is
submitted to the Governor-in-Council (reg. 55), who

may if the lease is declared void grant to the appli-

held under the determined 1 iase, without the necessity
of a formal application as for a new lease ( c ), on
payment of the value of any work and labor done on
the land available for future operations ( d ).
Land held under a gold mining lease is protected
from occupation as a claim under miner’s right, and
no one can mark out or take possession of the leased
land before re-entry by the iCrown, without obtaining
an adjudication by a competent court in his favor (e).
-
The Warden has jurisdiction in a complaint by a
holder of a miner’s right to be put in possession as a
claim of ground held under mining lease, and can if
the complainant has a right to recover the leased land
declare a forfeiture of such land for non-compliance
with the labor covenants, but the holder of a miner’s
right cannot enforce forfeiture of a lease held by a
defendant for non-compliance with the labor covenants
until the lease has been legally forfeited by the
Governor-in-Council ( / ).
But the Warden has no jurisdiction to make a
merely declaratory order under The Judicature Act

complainant on due forfeiture of the lease to apply to
the Warden to be put in possession.
Where, however, a lessee* who was manager of a
company and applicant for a lease for such company,
died after execution of the lease by the Governor, and
before execution of it by the lessee, and the repre-
sentatives of the lessee did not obtain permission to
execute the lease in his stead within the sixty days
prescribed by reg. 28 of 1871 [reg. 33 of 1890] it was
held that the Warden had jurisdiction to hear and
determine a complaint by the holder of a miner’s
right to be put in possession of the ground ( i).
And on appeal from the Warden to the Court of
Mines, the judge of which court stated a case for the
opinion of the Chief Judge, |it was held that section
39 of the Act No. 291 [No. 1120, sec. 67] would not
operate to render valid a lease which had not been
executed within the prescribed time (reg. 28), as
against a person who obtained possession from the
Warden after the time had elapsed, and before the
execution of the lease (j). i
In the case referred to, defendant applied for a lease
under the regulations, and notice was published in the
Gazette (reg. 28 of 1871—see reg. 33 of 1890) requir-
ing the lessee to execute th 3 lease within sixty days,
or it would be void, and the lessee did not execute the
lease within that time, and plaintiff, being the holder
of a miner’s right, proceeded before the Warden for a

was allowed to execute the lease after the proceedings

that the execution by the Governor operates only
by way of escrow, dependent for completion on exe-
cution by the lessee within the time prescribed by the
regulations ; and that the Warden had authority to
question the power of the Governor to allow execution
by the lessee making a lease effectual after the expira-
tion of the prescribed sixty days; and that the
Warden had power to declare the lease void, and to
put the complainant in possession of the ground ( k ).
The amending statute of 11872 (I), passed since the
above decision, makes it unlawful to mark out as a
claim any land the subject of an application for a
lease, and no such marking but will confer any right
or title to such ground, but is regarded as a trespass
on the land applied for (n), unless default in the
application be shown.

CHAPTER IV.
GOLD MINING ON PRIVATE PROPERTY.
SECTION I.—LICENSES TO MINE ON PRIVATE PROPERTY.
The passing of The Mining on Private Property
Act 1884, which came into operation on November 25
of that year (a), caused a complete revolution in the
law regarding mining on land alienated from the
Crown. Before that date no means existed by which
a miner could enter on freehold land for the purpose
of mining without the consent of the freeholder, and
consequently large areas of private land lay idle and
unworked as mines, or even prospected. It is true
that in most instances the miner could obtain a license
from the freeholder to enter and mine on his land, but
in many cases an exorbitant percentage of the gold
obtained, or royalty as it was erroneously termed, was
demanded where the lead or reef was known to be
rich; and if it were poor, the miner could not afford
to pay out of the yields from it even a smaller
percentage, while prospecting was rendered almost
impracticable.

Mining with

Numerous attempts werej made by successive
parliaments from time to time to pass measures
authorising and regulating mining on private pro-
perty, but without success, it being generally con-
sidered that it was a matter not so much of public
interest as of private enterprise, until the existing
Act, imperfect as it is in many respects, formed the
beginning of a new legislation.
It has always been held that gold, whether on
Crown land or on private property, is the property of
the Crown. “By the law of England, which is also
the law of this country, all gold mines belong to the
Crown, and though the Crown may have granted the
lands containing them to a subject without reserva-
tion, the gold under the grantee’s land is not his, and
neither he nor any one else has a right as against the
Crown to take it ” ( b ).
And a Crown grant does not pass to the grantee
royal mines ( i.e. gold and silver) that may be found
under the land, unless the intention that such
minerals should pass is expressly stated in the grant
by apt and precise words (c).
But though gold on private property belongs to the
Crown, the Government for a long time permitted
owners and those bargaining with them to mine
without interruption as to the Crown claiming the
real profit of the gold ( d ); and thus it came about
that a miner desirous of mining on private land dis-

regarded the rights of the Crown, and with the tacit :
consent of the Crown entered into an agreement with
the landowner, who granted a license authorising
mining on his land, and occupation of portion of the
surface, upon specified terms, and subject to the
payment of either a rent or a percentage of the gold
obtained, or more frequently of both.
Though such an agreement and license were in a
manner illegal, the rights of the landowner were,
however, respected, and mining on private property
with the tacit consent of the Crown was held not to
be illegal so as to avoid contracts ( e ), though subject
at all times to the assertion of its right by the
Crown (/).
And a landowner mining on his own land for gold
was held entitled to restrain others wrongfully carry-
ing on similar works and encroaching on such land
( g) ; and persons mining on private property under
license from the owner might restrain mining thereon
by the owner, or by any persons claiming under
him (h).
The owner of freehold land alone and in his own
right as freeholder could, however, only restrain
mining so far as it caused damage to the surface of
the land (i), though if the Attorney-General were

SECTION lI.—“THE MINING ON PRIVATE PROPERTY
ACT” [NO. 1120, PART ll.]
The right of the Crown to royal mines having been
established, the policy of the Legislature was to virtually
convert all alienated land in the colony into Crown land
for the purpose only of gold mining thereon, providing
a reasonable compensation for surface damage,
and asserting the right of the Crown to the gold,
regardless of the freehold interest held by the owner
in the land. This in a measure was done by The
Mining on Private Property Act 1884 (a).
Subject to the provisions of the Act the Governor
may grant leases for mining for gold on or below the
surface of any private land, with all the usual appur-
tenances to mining interests (6), for a term not
exceeding fifteen years (sec. 80) [No. 1120, sec. 322],

minimum rent reserved in any lease shall be not less
than one pound per annum (d) ; and these leases may
be renewed on the expiration of their term without
payment of any compensation other than compensa-
tion to the owner and occupier for depriving him of
the surface of the land, and any prospective damage
to the surface beyond what has been already paid for
(sec. 31) [No. 1120, sec. 326].
In certain cases, as in the case of land used for
for gardens, or on which buildings, etc., are situated,
mining leases will not be granted unless the freehold
be taken ( i.e . purchased) by the applicant (secs. 32,
33) [No. 1120, secs. 327, 328]; nor will a lease be
granted of any land on which a hospital, church, or
public building is situated, or of any mines under any
cemetery, reservoir or waterworks, or within one
hundred and fifty yards thereof, without the written
consent of the owners or trustees of, the land (sec.
34) [No. 1120, sec. 329], (v
The mode of applying for a mining lease of private
is fully set out in the regulations contained
in schedule XXXIII. to the Act No. 1120. An appli-
cant for a lease of private property is not required to
mark out the land previous to his application, as an
entry for this purpose would be a trespass on the land
as against the owner. The land applied for is marked
out by the mining surveyor of the district (reg. 8),
who is required to erect white posts to define the
extent of the area below the surface, and red posts to
define the area of the surface in respect of which the
lease is applied for. The applicant is required to state
in his application what surface is sought to be
included in his lease.

Assessment of

In all other respects the application is similar to an
application for a gold mining lease of Crown lands
(regs. 4 a, 4 h, 4c, 5) with the exception of the notice of
the application given to the occupier. This, and the
notice to the owner, are given by the Warden (reg. 6).
The mode of service of notices is prescribed by reg.
39a.
There appears to be no provision in the Act to
compel an applicant to proceed with his application,
and it seems an applicant can abandon or withdraw
his application for a lease at any stage (reg. 38), which
throws on the owner the hardship of the loss of his
costs, except the balance that may be recovered out of
the deposit money (reg. 37), which is often totally inade-
quate, or except he proceed under sec. 22 [No. 1120,
sec. 314] to apply for costs, as well as the loss of his
time and trouble in litigating for compensation.
It is, however, within the power of the applicant
for a lease and an owner or occupier to agree as to the
amount of compensation to be paid or made, and an
agreement or contract may be made or entered into by
them for compensation being made either by payment
of a stipulated sum of money, or by a percentage of
the gold taken from the mines under the land, or
otherwise (e). A copy of the agreement duly signed
must be forwarded to the Minister of Mines (reg. 24),
and the owner and lessee should each possess a copy
of it in addition, as showing the contract between
them irrespective of the lease from the Crown.
If, however, the amount of purchase money of land
taken, & the compensation for surface damage, be not
arrived at by agreement, the claim therefor is heard

1120, s. 308] ; for form of agree-

lations.


and determined by the Warden (without assessors) or
by the Court of Mines held under the provisions of
the Act No. 291 [No. 1120, Part I.]; but if the claim
is adjudicated on by the Warden, appeal from his
determination will lie to the Court of Mines, and the
Warden or the Court of Mines is a tribunal to assess
compensation to be paid before the lease is issued by
the Crown (secs. 18, 19) [No. 1120, secs. 310, 311].
The Crown is not in anyway interested in the
amount of the compensation ; the Minister of Mines,
through whom the compensation is paid to the owner,
is merely a depository of the amount payable (secs.
23, 27) [No. 1120, secs. 315, 319], The parties
materially interested are the owner and the applicant,
and for this reason neither of them can be excluded
from the enquiry held in the matter of the claim (/).
In assessing the amount of compensation payable to
the owner, the Warden acts in a judicial capacity and
not as a mere persona designata for assessing com-
pensation, and he can state a special case under sec.
194 of the Act No. 291 [No. 1120, sec. 236] for the
opinion of the Supreme Court. He may in the
enquiry on an application for renewal of a lease
take into consideration the probable prospective
increase in surface value by reason of the land
becoming available for any purpose to which the
surface might, but for the lease, with reasonable
probability be applied during its currency, but he
must not consider the condition of any underground
workings, or the value of the timber in them, and he
is not limited to considering only the grazing or
agricultural value of the land ( g ).

The proceedings taken under sec. 18 [No. 1120, sec.

Warden or a plaint in the Court of Mines. In the
former the application before the Warden, and in the
latter the proceedings for setting down the case before
the Court of Mines, sufficiently make the applicant a
party ( h ) ; and in an application before the Court of
Mines the court may proceed without the presence of
the applicant if he fail or neglect to appear, and
should assess compensation upon the evidence sub-
mitted by the owner and applicant if they attend, or by
either the other not attending (i).
All mining leases under The Mining on Private Pro-

such lease be granted under sec. 4 ( j) or under sec.

similar to objections to leases of Crown lands (reg.
10). An objection to the granting of the lease is,
however, a proceeding entirely different from the
claim for compensation under sec. 18 of No. 796 [No.
1120, sec. 310], The latter is a proceeding seeking to
recover compensation for the compulsory taking of
the ground, a proceeding which per se gives the owner
no right to object to the granting of the lease, pro-
vided the land is not exempted by the Act from the
operation of mining leases ; whilst an objection is a
proceeding seeking to prevent the granting of the
lease altogether on some valid ground, such as dis-
puted priority of application, etc.
No provision is made in the regulations requiring
an objector to lodge money with his objection to meet
probable costs, as is the case in the regulations
relating to gold mining leases of Crown lands ; but the
Warden and Court of Mines have a discretionary
power to award costs to the owner, occupier or appli-
cant (sec. 22) [No. 1120, sec. 314], payment of which
costs may be enforced under sec. 146 of the Act No.
291 [No. 1120, sec. 183] (I) ; and the amount of costs
to be allowed does not appear to be limited, and would
consequently be taxed on the scales fixed by the
general rules for proceeding before Wardens and in
the Court of Mines.
Private land under the Act includes any land alien-
ated by the Crown prior to Dec. 29, 1884, for any
estate in fee simple at law or in equity (m). Any

The Warden has power to order inspection by a

person who disobeys such order liable to a penalty
not exceeding £5O (sec. 47) [No. 1120, sec. 346], to be
recovered in a summary way before any justice (u).
An injunction may also be granted by the Supreme
Court or by the Court of Mines to restrain trespass or
encroachment at the suit of the Attorney General, or
of the owner, or of any person in lawful possession
of the land, without proof of any special or material
damage (sec. 48) [No. 1120, sec. 347], and generally
the jurisdiction conferred on the Warden and the
Court of Mines by the Act No. 291 [No. 1120, Part
I.] witli respect to mining on Crown lands applies to
any private land comprised in a lease held under the
Act No. 796 (sec. 37) [No. fIUO, sec. 335].
Private land may be taken up as a claim under the
by-laws, subject to an agreement being made between
the miner and the land owner. By the Act No.
1120, Part 11. provision is made whereby owners of
private land may agree with the holders of miners’
rights to take possession of land for gold mining pur-
poses as if it were Crown land, subject to the by-laws
of the district in which it is situated, without obtain-
ing a mining lease of the land (sec. 350). In taking-
up land under this section, as soon as the agreement
is executed and approved by the Warden, and regis-
tered in accordance with the regulations made under
Part 11. of the Act, the private property subject of
such agreement becomes for all mining purposes

The restrictions against unauthorised mining on
private property are very stringent. Any person who
takes or removes gold from private land without
obtaining a mining lease of the land or holding it
under miner’s right in pursuance of sec. 51 [No.
1120, sec. 350], is subject to a penalty of £5 for every
day during which he works the land, and forfeiture of
all gold taken from such land; and on a second con-
viction to be punished for a misdemeanour by impris-
onment for a period not exceeding twelve months (sec.
49) [No. 1120, sec. 348]. This would apply to an
owner removing gold from his own land; but it is
assumed it would not prevent work being done on the
surface; or even a shaft being sunk, with the consent
of the owner, pending an application for a lease, so
long as no gold was removed.
The owner of land held under mining lease has the
right of re-entry on application to the Governor-in-
Council on forfeiture of the lease when the mining
operations have wholly ceased (sec. 39) [No. 1120, sec.
338]; and where private land has been purchased by
an applicant for a lease, and mining operations have
not been commenced on the land comprised in such
lease within a period of one year from the date of
such purchase, or if mining operations have wholly
ceased for a year, the land will revert to the owner
and be re-conveyed to him (sec. 33) [No. 1120, sec.
328],

necessary for the proper working of a mine comprised
in any lease under The Mining on Private Property
Act, or of any lease or claim held under The Mining
Statute (sec. 86) [No. 1120, sec. 335].
Mining leases of private property may be trans-
ferred, sub-leased, mortgaged or surrendered by the
lessee at any time during their currency, with the
consent of the Governor-in-Council (sec. 35) [No.

the same manner as a license to deal with leases of
Crown lands.

MINING INTERESTS OTHER THAN
CLAIMS AND LEASES.
CHAPTER I.
MINING PARTNERSHIPS OTHER THAN
INCORPORATED COMPANIES.
Bk. 111. Chap. I.
Co-operative
mining
companies.
From the earliest days of the diggings in the colony
it has been customary for two or more men to band
themselves together as mates for the purpose of gold
seeking, or in other words to form a partnership by
verbal agreement. This practice is frequently carried
out at the present day, or where considerable outlay is
anticipated it is customary for a larger number of
miners to form themselves into a partnership by
means of a partnership agreement or deed of associa-
tion, without registration under The Mining Com-
panies Act. These partnerships are usually known
as co-operative companies, and it is with these and


similar partnerships that we have to deal in discussing
the law affecting mining partnerships in Victoria.
As to what suffices to constitute a miner a partner
the ordinary laws of partnership apply, and they need
not be discussed here. One partner or mate could not
sue his mates or co-partners at law (a), neither can
one partner in a claim sell or dispose of more than his
own share in it (b). , v
.
A joint adventure is not necessarily a partnership,
and the fact of gold being placed to a joint account
will not per se constitute a partnership. And where
in a joint adventure, not being a partnership, one
party advances money necessary to carry it on, he
may at law recover from the other party his share of
the amount (c).
And a mate or partner in a claim is not necessarily ■
a partner in all transactions, and unless otherwise
agreed between them the partnership will comprise
only the claim worked by them in conjunction.
Thus, where P was a sleeping partner with M who
worked the claim, during which work M discovered a
new reef, and took up and registered himself for a
claim on the new reef, it was held that P the sleeping-
partner in the old claim, had no interest in the new
claim, which had nothing to do with the partner-
ship (d).
An undivided share in a claim under sec. 77 of the '
Act No. 32 was held to mean a share with others to

the clause.
• work the claim for the common purpose of dividing
the proceeds as partners. It is often absolutely
necessary that the claim should be worked by all the
partners, and if it were not worked by the whole it
could not be worked at all. It was for the Warden to
determine in effect whether a partnership existed, and
if he so determined he could put a partner in posses-
sion of his individual share in such claim (e).
Working on terms of receiving a sum fortnightly to
be deducted from dividends will not of itself con-
stitute a partnership, the stipulation being for a share
of dividends and not of income (/).
The unrepealed portion of the Act 31 Vic. No. 324
(sec. 9) [The Instruments Act 1890, sec. 212] provides
that no action shall be brought whereby to charge any
member of a partnership or co-adventure established
or to be established for mining purposes and not
registered under The Mining Companies Limited
Liability Act 1864 (g), upon any simple contract
made by or with any other member of such partner-
ship or co-adventure on behalf of the same, unless
such contract, or some memorandum or note thereof,
shall be made or contained by, or in some writing to
be signed by the defendant in such action (A).
The object of this clause is to protect a partner
from an action by a stranger with whom another of
the partners has contracted on behalf of the partner-

ship, unless the partner defendant has assented to the
contract in writing. Partners for mining purposes
not registered as a company are as to adjusting
accounts between themselves liable for expenditure
incurred by other partners with sufficient authority
from them, though there may be no written evidence
of that authority (i) ; but a member of an unregis-
tered company is not liable upon a contract made by
a manager or agent of the company to whose appoint-
ment he did not assent, and to whom he did not give
authority in writing. Such a manager is agent only
for those who appointed him, or authorised him to
contract on their behalf (j).
Where miners holding a claim in partnership form
themselves into an incorporated company and one
partner is excluded, the partner so excluded cannot
sue the company to be declared entitled to shares in
the company as representing his share in the claim.
He must sue his co-partners for having appropri-
ated his property as theirs in the amalgamation
(k) ; and if some of a number of partners form
themselves into a company to register it, excluding
some of the partners, the new registered company
does not represent the persons originally registered
for the claim, and therefore cannot sue for encroach-
ment (I).

will not affect the remedies |which creditors possessed

(m); and it seems when a company is illegally regis-
tered under The Mining Companies Act it remains an
ordinary mining partnership, and the law of partner-
ship as distinguished from that of mining companies
will apply (n).
But where three partners, who were lessees from
the Crown, floated and registered a company to work
leased ground, but after registration of the company
failed to transfer the lease, it was held that they were
merely trustees and must transfer the lease to the
company (o).
A partner, however, who has been excluded from an
unregistered company cannot maintain a suit against
his co-partners, seeking to he entitled to his share in
the ground, unless he holds a miner’s right in force at
the time the cause of suit arose ( p ). But such an
exclusion will not operate as a dissolution of the
partnership as regards the excluded partner, and if
several partners refuse to acknowledge another as
a partner, where no time is specified for the con-
tinuance of the partnership, that will not necessarily
dissolve the partnership and exclude the partner
whom the others have refused to acknowledge ( q ).
But where a partner abandoned his share and
allowed his rights to lie dormant for nine years after
resigning his share, he was held to be debarred by his
negligence from asserting any right to such share (r);

though it is otherwise where there is no negligence or
carelessness. Thus, in May, 1858, K, a partner with
others in a claim, attended a meeting of the partners,
and declined to contribute towards sinking a shaft
which his partners proposed to sink. He did not pay
;nto the mine, and his partners continued working it.
K offered to surrender his share to the other partners if
they would give him a release from all liabilities in
respect of the partnership, but the other partners
declined to do this. Two years afterwards, in 1860,
the mine became valuable and K claimed his share;
the other partners resisted on the ground that he had
forfeited or abandoned his share. It was held that K
had not been guilty of such laches as would reason-
ably lead his partners to suppose that he had aban-
doned his share, and that he was entitled to his
interest in the ground (s). '
A partner is not prohibited from seeking to enforce
forfeiture of a claim in which he holds a share, as
against his co-partners. There is no principle of
equity violated in one of several partners proceeding
for forfeiture of a claim held by him with others for
his own benefit; but a shareholder ought in that, as in
all other acts, treat all his co-shareholders alike,
whether that treatment be amicable or hostile ( t ).
Jurisdiction is given to the Court of Mines to hear
and determine all suits concerning any partnership
for or in relation to mining on any Crown land (u),

lands only ( x).

CHAPTER II.
WATER RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES.
In mining parlance the term water right may be
held to include the privilege conferred by the Act
No. 291 [No. 1120, Part I.] on the holder of a miner’s
right of cutting, constructing and using races, tail
races, dams and reservoirs for gold mining purposes
through and upon any Crown lands, and of taking or
diverting water from any spring, lake, pool or stream
situate or flowing through or adjoining any Crown
lands, and to use such water for mining for gold, or
for his domestic use (a).
The means by which such water rights may be
acquired and held are defined by the by-laws made
under the Act No. 291, sec. 71 (iv.) [No. 1120, sec. 106,
iv.], which by-laws also provide for the events in
which they are liable to become forfeited, relinquished
or abandoned (sec. 71 (vii.) (ix.) (x.)) [No. 1120, sec.
106 (vii.) (ix.) (x.)], and for their assignment (xii.).

Governor-in-Council may also grant to any person for
any term not exceeding fifteen years a license author-
ising him to cut, construct and use races, drains, dams,
and reservoirs through or upon any Crown lands,
whether such land shall or shall not be held under
miner’s right or mining lease, and to take or divert
water from any spring, lake, pool or stream, in order
to supply water for the purpose of gold mining, and
the right conferred by such license is deemed a chattel
interest (h).
This license is granted under regulations made in
pursuance of the Act (c), which regulations define the
meaning of the words race, drain, dam and reservoir.
The conditions under which the license is issued are
embodied in the license.
At common law every man may stop and use and
appropriate all rain water, as contradistinguished
from streams, flowing over his land, and may erect
dams on his land to retain the water, but he cannot
complain of a stranger interrupting the water above
him ( d ). But this stopping and using of rain water
would not be considered as a water right, as would be
the case were the water diverted from a stream. The
owner of land bounding a stream or river is not, as
between himself and others lower down the stream,
warranted in diverting water so as to considerably
diminish the volume of water in the stream or
river ( e ).

And it seems that the holder of a creek right under
the by-laws (/) would not have priority over a license
granted under the Act 25 Yic. No. 148, sec. 11 (g), and
would not be entitled to deprive the holder of such
license of any portion of the water specified in such
license when the natural supply is insufficient for
both (A).
It is incumbent on persons using a stream so to use
it as not to injure others. Thus, in an action for
throwing sludge on plaintiff’s land, whereby it was
injured, defendants pleaded that as holders of miners’
rights mining on Crown lands they used a stream
flowing through those lands, which afterwards flowed
through plaintiff’s land, for washing auriferous earth
and for their mining operations, and as an outlet for
the water so used, in consequence of which the stream
was discolored, which was the grievance complained
of; but it was held on demurrer that the plea was
bad ( i ).
The holder of a miner’s right is entitled to occupy
Crown lands for a dam for domestic purposes, though
not actually engaged in mining ( j) ; and a water race
holder under the by-laws, who has complied with the
by-laws, and who is the holder of a miner’s right and
resides on a goldfield, is entitled under the Act No.
291 [No. 1120, Part I.] to hold a residence area (A).

But the holder of a dam was not entitled under the
former Public Works Act (I) to have the ownership of
a watershed over Crown lands from which the water
would naturally flow to his dam, and which right he
could only get from the Crown by express grant.
The Act only protected him in the ownership of the
dam itself, and against all direct injuries to it (in) ;
and where on a complaint for disturbing a water race
the defendant relied on a Crown grant of the land,
and complainant on his miner’s right, it was held that
a question of title was involved which ousted the
jurisdiction of the justices ( n ).
The Warden has jurisdiction (o) to hear a complaint
by the owner of a water right license for diversion
and abstraction of water from his source of supply
(p) ; but in a complaint for trespass to a right to use
and divert water for mining purposes, the Warden
cannot go into the question of prospective injury to
the complainant’s rights from the defendant’s acts, or
injury to any right which the complainant might have
to the surface of the land, or of trespass to the land
occupied by the complainant’s race ( q ).

(r) it is provided that any person to whom a license is

SECTION 1.-REGULATION AND INSPECTION OF MINES.
By The Regulation and Mines and Machinery Act
1883 [No. 1120, Part 111, Div. I] (a) general rules are
promulgated for the management of mines and mining
works, and any mine manager or any person in charge
of the works and operations who contravenes or fails
to comply with such rules is guilty of an offence
against the Act, unless he proves that he had taken
all reasonable means to prevent such contravention or
non-compliance.
In a former Act, since repealed (b), the owner of a
mine was defined to mean the manager of an incor-
porated company, i.e. the statutory manager, and in
the case of an unincorporated company the person
having the management of the mining operations (c),
and under a subsequent Act, also repealed (d), the
manager was held to be liable unless he took means

to prevent the non-compliance with the regulations
and provisions of the Act; and merely reporting want
of appliances to the directors of the company was not
sufficient ( e ).
Under the repealed Act No. 480, the owner, i.e. the
manager of an incorporated company, or the person
having the management of the operations of an incor-
porated company, was held liable, even though the
miner injured may have been negligent, unless the
non compliance with the provisions of the Act were
entirely attributable to the miner. Where the acci-
dent was not caused by non-observance of the provi-
sions of the Act the common law was held to apply,
except that the owner was by the Act expressly made
answerable for the acts of a fellow-servant of the
injured miner, and contributory negligence on the part
of such miner was held to be a good defence ( f).
And under the same Act, No. 480, Sec. 5 (viii.),
where an accident occurred in a mine occasioning
bodily injury to any one working therein, iC the
statutory manager of a company owning sucli mine had
not contravened the prescribed rules, lie was held not
liable under a complaint framed under the first branch
of the concluding clause of sec 5 (g).
The doctrine that a master is not responsible to one
servant for injuries resulting from the negligence of
another servant has by these statutes been abrogated
as to mining accidents, and an action under the Act
No. 480 was held to be sufficiently sustained by proof
of the happening of the accident, unless the defendant

could show how it happened, and that it was the
result of some vis major for which no one was to
blame, or that it was the result solely of the injured
miner’s neglect of the provisions of the Act (h).
Under Section 2 of the repealed Act No. 480 a drive
which had been worked out and left unused was not
deemed to be a drive or part of a mine (i); but in the
existing Act, No. 783, Sec. 3 [No. 1120 Sec. 351],
special words are inserted to include a worked out or
unused part of a mine (j).
By sub-sec. viii. of sec. 5 of the Act No. 480, which
is re-enacted in the Act No. 783, sec. 8 (x.) [No. 1120,
sec. 357 (x.) ], a drive or any excavation in connection
with the working of a mine must be protected and
made safe for persons working therein, and this is not
confined to injuries occurring in the drive or excava-
tion which is not securely protected, but to persons
working in the mine (k) ; and a “ platform ” under the
Act No. 783 sec. 8 (xxix.) [No. 1120, sec. 357 (xxix.)]
and sec. 16 means something attached to the ladder or
side of the shaft (1).

intended to keep the lift or pump tube secure in the
shaft, which had fallen from its position, and the
miner admitted that he had known of its being loose

mation of the fact to the manager, it was held under
the Act No. 583, sec. 12 (m) that the plaintiff had not
been guilty of contributory negligence in not report-
ing as dangerous what had existed so long without
occasioning injury (n).
Under the Act No. 583, sec. 6 (x.) (o) a means of
communication from the top to the bottom of a shaft,
or signalling by certain knocks with a hammer upon
the centres of the top of the shaft, which was under-
stood by the miners and proved effective, was held to
be a sufficient compliance with the Act (p).
The existing Act, No. 783, sec. 5 [No. 1120, sec. 353]
requires that miners shall not be employed below
ground for more than forty-eight hours in any week,
nor more than eight hours in any day, except in cases
of emergency ; but where miners are allowed half an
hour for refreshment during their shift, which time is
entirely at their own disposal, their employer is not
liable to a penalty for keeping them eight hours and
a-half below ground. He only employs them for
eight hours, and during the half-hour they were not
at the order of their employer, who during that time
had no control over them ( q).
Sec. 6 (xx.) of the Act No. 583, corresponding with
sec. 8 (xxxi.) of the Act No. 783 [No. 1120, sec. 357

machinery in connection with the working of a mine,

vened or not complied with, or it will be bad for
vagueness (t).
With the view of enforcing compliance with the
provisions of the Act the appointment of inspectors of
mines is authorized (u), whose duty it is to inspect
any mine or mining machinery for the purpose of
ascertaining whether the provisions of the Act are
being complied with, and the owner of the mine or
machinery is required to render all facilities for the
purpose of such inspection ; and notice of any accident
occurring in a mine must be given to the local
inspector within twenty-four hours after the occur-
rence of the accident, and the portion of the mine
where the accident occurred must not be interfered
with until it has been inspected.
Any person charged under this division of the Act
is a competent witness on his own behalf (v) and no
person so charged can be compelled to be a witness at

SECTION lI.—DRAINAGE OF MINES.
Where a number of mines are being worked along
the course of a continuous reef or lode the mine which
contains the deepest workings will naturally receive

the drainage waters from other portions of the reef
or lode beyond the boundaries of such mine; and it
would be manifestly unjust that one mineowner should
be burdened with the expense of draining the ad-
joining mines without receiving some compensation
for so doing.
This difficulty was experienced in the earliest times
of working deep mines, and several Acts were passed
from time to time dealing with the subject. The
Quartz Drainage Act {a), regulating the drainage of
mines on quartz reefs, proved to be inefficient, for in a
case under that Act, where a person obtained a decree
before the Warden against a company holding a gold-
mining lease from the Crown, for money due as
contribution for draining their claim, a rule was made
absolute prohibiting further proceedings, but without
costs, on the ground that the Act applied only to
claims, and that a gold mining lease was not a
claim (h).
This Act was repealed by The Mining Statute 1865,
which empowered the mining boards to make by-laws
for enforcing and regulating the drainage of quartz
reefs and claims (c), but the numerous complicated
by-laws made in pursuance of this Act proved very
cumbrous, and the sub-sections (xiv.) (xv.) of sec. 71,
and all by-laws made under them, were repealed by
the present Drainage of Mines Act 1877 (d), [see No.
1120, Part 111., Div. 2J.
Under this Act owners of pumping machinery may
require contribution from mineowners whose mines

are drained by such machinery, and contribution
under this Act may be recovered from the owner of a
mine on the same line of reef, although the machinery
used for drainage purposes is also used for the general
working of the mine (e).
In case the parties interested cannot agree as to the
payment of drainage dues, the owner of the machinery
may proceed against the mineowners liable for such
payment before the Warden, who may make an order
on such mineowners to pay such sums periodically or
otherwise to the owner of such machinery as he shall
think just and reasonable, and may in making his
order impose on the owner of the machinery such
terms as shall seem just for the efficient working
thereof (sec. 3) [No. 1120, sec. 378].
Either party may require the matter to be heard
and determined before the Warden and assessors, and
the proceedings are to be conducted in conformity
with the Act No. 291, [No. 1120, Part I].
In determining which mineowners shall be liable to
contribute towards the expense of drainage, regard
must be had to the total length of reef or lode affected
by the drainage operations, and to the benefit derived
therefrom by such mineowners (sec. G) [No. 1120,
sec. 381] who are entitled to receive credit for the
value of any work they may perform in assisting to
drain the reef or lode (sec. 7) [No. 1120, sec. 382); and
no drainage fees are payable during suspension of
draining operations (sec. 5) [No. 1120, sec. 380].

that a claim should not be liable to forfeiture during
any period for which drainage dues were being paid,
it was held that the claim was not protected from being-
declared abandoned by the Warden on an application to
be put in possession of such claim, on the ground that
the owners of it were liable to pay drainage assess-
ment, whether such payment had been made or not;
there should be an actual payment, and not a mere
liability to pay ( g).
The mode by which drainage dues payable are
arrived at is by calculating—
(a) The interest on the value of machinery and
plant used for drainage purposes only ;
(b) The wear and tear of such machinery and
plant;
(c) The cost of oil, grease, and packing;
(d) The proportionate cost of fuel expended, or of
horses employed, in drainage operations ;
(e) The wages of engine-drivers, or of other
persons, in such proportions as such persons may be
deemed to be employed in draining a mine ; and
(f) Such other expenses as the owner of the
machinery can prove have necessarily been incurred
in respect of the drainage effected by such machinery
(sec. 4) [No. 1120, sec. 379].
Contracts may be made, apart from The Drainage
of Mines Act, between mineowners on one line of reef,
for the purpose of draining their mines. And where
an owner of machinery covenanted by deed to keep
down the water in a mine belonging to an adjoining
mineowner by means of pumping machinery, which
was to be worked constantly and without stoppage,
and the machinery was not worked on Sundays, but

the water was kept under, this was held to be a
sufficient compliance with the contract (h).
The procedure before the Warden, is regulated by
an amending Act (i) and the moneys directed by the
Warden’s order to be paid become a charge upon the
estate of the owner of the mine in respect of which
such moneys are directed to be paid.
SECTION lII.—MUNICIPAL ASSESSMENTS.
Gold mines have always been exempt from payment
of municipal rates. The word “ mines ” is, however,
capable of a very wide construction, and many
attempts have been made by various municipalities to
enforce rates payable, or claimed to be payable, on
buildings or appurtenances of mines. Several de-
cisions have, however, been obtained on the question,
and the definition of mines within the meaning- of
The Local Government Act 1874 (a) is now fairly
established. “ The word ‘ mines ’ includes every fair
adjunct to the mine, and the adjuncts are not merely
machinery for the purpose of moving the earth to the
surface, but also machinery necessary for making it
into a marketable state. But it includes nothing
beyond that, and certainly not machinery used for
crushing ore brought from other mines, or other ore
belonging to a stranger ” (6).
And the word “ mines ” in The Local Government
Act includes all land held as a claim under miner’s

right, or under a gold-mining lease, and therefore if a
building be part of a mine, and a necessary adjunct
to that mine, it will be exempt from payment of
rates, no matter for what purpose or use it may be
applied ( c ).
Smithies are not necessary adjuncts to a mine, and
are ratable property (</), but a building enclosing an
engine and batteries erected by two companies at the
intersection of their leases, and extending on to the
ground of both companies, half the stamp heads being
set apart for each company, is a necessary adjunct to
the leased land of both companies, and is therefore
exempted from rates (e).
Where, however, the property rated was described
in the assessment as “ engine and battery of twelve
heads, with blacksmith’s shop, office, and store,” it was
held that the battery as a necessary adjunct to the
mine was, along with the mine, exempted from rates,
but that the other property as no such necessary
adjunct was not exempted, and was liable to be
rated (/).
If mining property is rated as “ works, and not as
a mine, the word “ works ” must be taken, in the
absence of anything to the contrary appearing on the
face of the rate, to mean only ratable property.
“Describing merely as ‘works’ land on which there
are mines, is at the most an insufficient description
and insufficiency of description in the rate does not

; form a valid objection to a demand for payment of
such rate ” (g) ; and where the whole mine has been
rated, in default of an appeal against the assessment,
the justices before whom the rate is sought to be
enforced cannot reduce it to the amount due on the
buildings actually ratable. If the defendant is liable
for anything he is liable for all ( h ).
All machinery on the surface of the land used for
purposes strictly subservient to the working of the
mine should be regarded as part of the mine within
the exemption from rates, and if an engine is not an
adjunct to the mine on the land, the land is ratable.
But all machinery to be exempted must have the
character of being used for the purpose of extracting
the mineral from the mine, or extracting the metal
from that mineral; and land held under miner s right,
on which was machinery used for the purpose of
crushing for the mine and for others not interested in
it was held not to be exempted from rates (i) ; nor is
land held under lease on which is erected machinery
used for crushing for the lessees and for strangers (j) ;
nor is land on which is erected a public crushing
machine, which is not a mine within the meaning of
the Act, but crushing machinery for the public ( k ) ; nor
were mines on private property (I).

bound to adopt such measures as will prevent injury
to others; and miners on Crown lands are not justified
in allowing a nuisance to continue which would injure
owners of adjoining claims, or owners of private
property (a).
If, therefore, a company allows sludge to flow on
private land, an injunction will be granted to restrain
it, but before an attachment will be granted it must
be shown that the company has committed a breach
of the injunction by not taking some precautions to
prevent mischief, if they still allow the sludge to
fl° w (!>)• U-M » -
And it is incumbent on persons mining on Crown
lands to use a stream flowing past the ground on
which they are mining in such a way as not to
injure the land or water of those below them ; and
persons throwing sludge on the land of another
cannot in defence say that they only used those
lands for the purpose of their mining
and that thereby the stream became necessarily im-
pregnated with earthy substances (c).
The right of a licensee of a puddling site to
allow sludge to pass over Crown lands is not an
easement necessarily granted by his license, and no
such easement or right is possessed by a defendant
who for years carried on mining operations with a
puddling machine under such a license, and discharged
sludge upon adjoining Crown land which was after-
wards proclaimed reserved for the supply of a reser-

voir (d). The flow of sludge from a puddling mill is
tolerated from the nature of things, but the toleration
of that nuisance is not necessarily the grant of a
right to the licensee (e).
An interlocutory injunction was granted to restrain
the flow of sludge from the works of one mining
company over the land of an adjoining mining com-
pany upon evidence that such sludge polluted a creek
running through the plaintiff company’s land, and
rendered the water of the creek unfit for mining pur-
poses ; but was refused as to the mere flow of sludge
over the surface of land in the occupation of a tenant.
But where a tenant has granted permission to an
adjoining mining company to run sludge over the
surface of the land occupied by him, the reversioner
is entitled to protect his land from an accumulation of
sludge upon it which would permanently injure its
value, but this case is not one for an interlocutory
injunction (/); and in such a case probable future
damage will not be considered ( g ).
But a tenant may give permission, effectual as
against his landlord during the tenancy, to a third
person to construct upon the land occupied by him as
such tenant a wooden flume or drainage channel,
provided it does not injure the soil; but such per-
mission will not afford evidence of a right in sucli
third person as against the reversioner after the
termination of the tenancy ( h ).

And where sludge from the workings of a third
person flows through the plaintiffs land, defendants
have no right to divert such sludge into their own
land, there to extract the water from it, and then
restore the residue in a more mischievous form into
the previous course down to the plaintiffs land ( i ).
It is no defence to an application for injunction to
aver that so many other persons contribute to a
nuisance that it would be useless to restrain the
defendants. If an injunction be granted restraining
defendants from allowing sludge to flow on to plain-
tiff s land, the passage of sludge through a flume over
the land of the plaintiffs is a breach of the injunction
if not perfect and complete, so as to prevent the
escape of sludge from the flume whereby it would
flow over the land (j).

SECTION I.—UNDER THE MINING ACTS.
The policy of the mining law of Victoria has always
been to permit miners to occupy certain portions of
Crown lands on a goldfield for the purpose of resi-
dence and business ; and though no definite enactment
was made with this view prior to The Goldfields Act
of 1855 (a), yet the gold mining licenses under the
first mining Act passed in the colony ( h ) authorised
the holder of such license “ to mine or dig for gold or
exercise and carry on any other trade or calling on
such Crown lands as shall he assigned to him for these
purposes ”; and the same privilege was extended to
holders of gold mining licenses under the Amending
Mining Act (c).
However, The Goldfields Act of 1855 (d) expressly
enacted that the holder of a document which then
first came into existence and was called a “miner’s

right ” should be entitled to occupy for the purpose of
residence and business so much of Crown lands as
should be allowed by rules to be framed under that
Act.
The same privileges were conferred by The Gold-
fields Act of January 1, 1858 (e) ; and by the Mining
Statute 1865 (/) those privileges were continued and
enlarged.
Under the latter statute, however, the title thus
acquired to land on the goldfields for the purpose of
residence or business was regulated by by-laws made
in pursuance of the Act (g), and Aiumerous difficulties
arose from time to time which called for special legis-
lation on the subject of these holdings. The Residence
Areas Act 1881 was passed on December 4, 1881 ( h )
defining the meaning of a residence area, which there-
tofore was a term that had grown by custom to be
applied to these titles, though never before expressed
in any legislative enactment, and providing for their
registration, cancellation ahd transfer. This Act was
subsequently amended by a further enactment (i),
permitting the holder of a residence area to purchase
the freehold of his holding under certain conditions,
and by virtue of a still further amending Act he is
allowed to pay the purchase money of such freehold
by instalments ( j ). These several Acts are now em-
bodied in The Mines Act 1890, Part I. (4).
SECTION lI.—RESIDENCE AREAS.
The term “mining purposed ” in the Act No. 291,
sec. 101 (hi.), did not include residence, neither did the

same expression in the Act/ No. 32, though by both of
these Acts the holder of a ininer’s right is entitled to
the privilege of residence bn a goldfield (a); but by
the Act No. 446, sec. 13 [No. 1120, sec. 135 (hi.)], it is
enacted that these words include the occupation
of Crown lands for the piirpose of residence or busi-
ness.
A residence area is any Crown land on any gold-
field, not exceeding in area one acre ( h ) in extent,
occupied for the time being in accordance with the
Act No. 291 [No. 1120, Part I.] and the by-laws by
the holder of a miner’s right or business license for
the purpose of residence, or of residence and carrying
on business (c).
Under the Act No. 291 [No. 1120, Part I] a married
woman may hold a residence area in her own right,
and may sublet or assign such area; and where the
by-laws required the holder to reside on the area,
residence by her or her assigns was held to be a
sufficient compliance (cl). And a resident on a gold-
field holding a miner’s right, who, though not mining,
was a water-race holder under the by-laws, was held
to be entitled to a residence area (e).
The holder of a residence area means the holder of
a miner’s right or business li sense who is for the time
being entitled to occupy a r ssidence area under the
Act No. 709, sec. 2 [No. 1120, sec. 27], but land already
occupied cannot be taken for the purpose of residence

without the consent of the occupier. So, a residence
area cannot be taken up on a frontage claim against
the will of the owner of the claim (/). But the
marking out of a residence area pending the applica-
tion for a lease of the same land is not illegal and
useless, except as against the applicant for the lease,
if the lease be ultimately grafted (g).
A holder of a residence a*ea was held to be en-
titled under the Act No. 291 to assign or sublet his
holding, unless the right were restricted by the
by-laws (h), but the sub-tenant must be the holder of
a miner’s right, otherwise the lessor could not re-
cover for use and occupation from his tenant (i),
nor could he recover possession (j). By The Resi-
dence Areas Act (No. 709, aec. 11) [No. 1120, sec.
39] a holder is, however, now entitled to sublet his
residence area.

(m), and the surface of land held as a residence
area or under business license was not to be taken
from the surface occupier without his consent, though
a claim might include a residence area unless the land
was exempted from occupation as a claim, and such
area might be mined upon, subject to liability for
disturbing the surface (n).
The Crown had no power; under the Act No. 291 to
grant a gold mining lease Conferring on the lessee a
right to mine under a residence area acquired prior to
the granting of the lease (h), and a person taking up
a claim over a residence irea acquired no title to
such claim, either as against the holder of such
residence area or anyone (p). ■ •
Ground held as a residence area was in the same
category with land proclaimed as a street or road, on
the assumption that no sound distinction could be
drawn between surface applied to a public use,
whether it be a street or a reserve for
and surface applied to the purpose of a residence
area (q).
Now, however, under The Residence Areas Act
1881 [as embodied in The Mines Act, Part 1., Div. I. (4) ]
leases may be granted to jbe effectual below the sur-
face of a residence area, tprovided the safety of any

land including land occupied as a residence area, or
under business license, granted before the passing of
the Act, are valid and effectual in all respects, as if
such leases had been granted with the consent of the
holder of such residence area or business license (s).
The principle of Gritchlev v. Graham ( t) applies to
the case of a residence area flit), and where one person
is in actual occupation of a residence area under a
claim of right no other person can acquire title to the
same land by merely marking it out, without first
instituting proceedings to dispossess the occupant ( v ) ;
and where one person is registered as the holder of a
residence area, no other person can at any time be-
come registered in respect of the same residence area
without first instituting proceedings to have the prior
registration cancelled; for only one title can exist in
respect of the same area at one time (w).
The Warden has jurisdiction under the Act No. ■

The Warden has jurisdiction to entertain a com-
plaint for forfeiture of a residence area for non-pay-
ment of a lien to secure which such area has been
transferred to the plaintiff, but the defendant might
have a suit for redemption on payment of the amount
of the lien, and any such proceedings should be taken
under both sections 101 (iii.) and 177 of the Act No.
291 [No. 1120, secs. 135 [hi.) and 216]. And if a
husband and wife are both in possession of the resi-
dence area, both may be sited (a).
An owner losing possession of a residence area by
the Warden’s order authorising a complainant to be
put in possession is by the Act allowed a reasonable
time for removing erections and fixtures on it; but
the words “at any time” in sec. 5 of No. 291, [No.

currency of his miner’s right (5).
Under The Residence Areas Act 1881 [No. 1120,
Part 1., Uiv. I. (4) ] the Warden has jurisdiction to
order cancellation of the registration of the holder of
a residence area, if such holder ceas’es to have a
miner’s right or business license, or if he has illegally
obtained registration (sec. 7) [No. 1120, sec. 32], or if

Failure to renew the miner’s right is fatal (c).
An uncertificated insolvent who holds a miner’s
right is entitled to maintain a complaint before the
Warden for trespass on his residence area, and his
assignee is not a necessary party ( d ).
Registration is part of the] title to a residence area
in addition to the right of occupation, and The Resi-
dence Areas Act makes registration necessary to
constitute a complete right of occupation. The
operative registration is the one having priority in
point of time (e).
The registration of a residence area is endorsed on
the miner’s right under which it is held, a similar

endorsement being made on each successive renewal of
the miner’s right (/), and this registration may be
cancelled by the Warden if the holder ceases to hold
a miner’s right or business license, or has obtained
registration illegally.
As before stated, the holder of a residence area
losing his right of occupation is allowed to remove
from the holding any buildings and fixtures he may
possess on it. The erection of buildings and fixtures
is necessarily entailed in mining on Crown lands, and
should all claim to these erections be lost as soon as

sought to encourage (g). But the holder of a resi-
dence area must exercise his right to remove buildings
and fixtures thereon belonging to him during his
tenure, or within a reasonable time after his right to
possession has ceased, and before any other person has
lawfully entered into possession ( h ).
When land is by Gazette notice exempted under the
Act No. 291, sec. 14 [No. 1120, sec. 17], from occupa-
tion for mining residence or business purposes, such
notice is a determination of the occupation, and a
person in lawful occupation of a residence area before
the Gazette notice is entitled to a demand for posses-
sion before a summons is issued .against him for being-
in illegal occupation of Crown lands ; but a previous
conviction for being in unauthorised occupation is a
a sufficient notice (i). And where land was tempo-
rarily reserved for public purposes, and permissive
occupancy was given to a municipal council for the
supply of gravel, the occupancy by the holder of a
residence area, even with the acquiescence of the
council, to whom he had paid rates, was held to be
determined by a subsequent exemption of the land
from occupation for mining purposes, and the council
had sufficient possession to maintain trespass, and the
holder of a residence area was a trespasser (j).
No person is allowed to hold more than one resi-
dence area within the distance ten miles from any
other residence area held by him, and a separate
miner’s right must be held for qach residence area (k).

The liolder of a residence area has the exclusive
right to occupy the surface of it, except as against the
Queen (Act No. 709, sec. 10) [No. 1120, sec. 35], and
may let (sec. 11) [sec. 39] or sell (sec. 12) [sec. 40] such
area, provided such sale or transfer is registered with
the mining registrar (sec. 13) [sec. 41]. But such let-
ting or sale must he in accordance with the Act.
Thus, where an agreement was entered into by A
with B, who was a woodcarter, that in consideration
of A allowing B the use of a road across the residence
area of A, B would pay 2s. 6d. per load of wood
carted, it was held that this was only a personal
license, and not an assignment of any portion of the
residence area, and did not create any interest in the
land as regarded B (I).
A residence area is exempt from occupation for
mining purposes under miner’s right, and therefore in
view of the Act cannot be taken as a claim (sec. 15)
[No. 1120, sec. 43]; but tye land included in the
residence area, at a depth of not less than fifty feet,
may be applied for and taken under a gold mining
lease (secs. 16, 17, 18) [No. 1120, secs. 44, 45, 46], pro-
vided that such lease contaiti a covenant by the lessee
to make good any subsidence that may be caused by
mining under such residence area.
A holder of a claim has n© right to reside on it, and
the right to occupy under a miner’s right does not
give the right to occupy for the purpose of residence ;
and though the right to occupy for mining might be
an answer to an attempt tb evict the occupant for
unauthorised occupation (m), yet he is liable to the

A holder of a miner’s rigl(it cannot occupy as a resi-
dence area part of a claim already in the occupation
of another person, if the surface so sought to be occu-
pied for residence is required for the purposes of the
claim. If the claimholder seeks to eject the holder of
a residence area in occupation of part of his claim, he
must prove that he requires the use of the surface of
the claim in dispute for gold mining purposes, but it
is not necessary to prove thqt he had actually used it
for those purposes ( o\
SECTION lII.—BUSINESS LICENSES.
By the interpretation clause of The Residence
Areas Act 1881 [No. 1120, sec. 27] a business license
is included in the term “ residence area,” so far as
that Act is concerned (a), and land held under such
a license is subject to the provisions of that Act;
and must be registered in the same manner as a
residence area.
The authority for the issue of a business license is
the Act No. 291, Part I. (2) [No. 1120, Part I, Div. I.
(2) ] which entitles the holder during the currency of
such license to occupy on any goldfield so much
Crown lands as the by-laws may prescribe (h). The
area to be taken was, however, limited by the Amend-
ing Residence Areas Act (c) to one acre.

A business license and the land held by virtue of it
may be sold, sublet or otherwise dealt with (d), and
generally the same law that applies to residence areas
is applicable also to business licenses. The holder of
a business license need not hold a miner’s right, and
of course his license confers on him no right to mine
on the land; it is held simply for the purpose of
residence and business (e).
If a person be charged with carrying on business
on a goldfield without a license, the onus lies on the
defendant to prove his authority to occupy ; it is not
for the prosecution to prove that he had not a license,
T)ut for the defendant to prove that he had one (/).
Occupation under a business license may be deter-
mined by notice in the Gazette exempting the land
from occupation for business purposes {[/), but the
"holder of the license is entitl m 1 to a demand of posses-
sion before being proceecje i against for being in
Unauthorised occupation of Crown land (It).
{ythe Warden has jurisdiction to put a complainant
in possession of land held under business license, and
may cause the defendant’s buildings to be removed
r therefrom. But where the Warden dismisses a com-
plaint seeking recovery of possession of a residence
area, or of land held under business license, he does
K not thereby deprive the defendant of any property he
/ may have in buildings and fixtures attached to the

Registration.
Title similar to

area.
Registration is essentially necessary to the validity
of title by business license coupled with residence,
and the registration is effected by endorsement by the
mining registrar on the license of a notification of the
fact of such registration, in the same manner as the
registration of a residence area is endorsed on the
miner’s right of the holder ( j).
It may be said that in all respects the title under a
business license is on an exhct footing with the title
to a residence area, and is governed by the clauses
referring to residence areas in Part I, Div. I. (4) of
The Mines Act (k).

BOOK IV.
MINING JUDICATURE.
CHAPTER I.
MINING COURTS OF JUSTICE.
The first mining act passed in the colony (a) autho-
rised the appointment of commissioners of Crown
lands, afterwards known as Goldfields Commissioners,
who were empowered to enquire into all cases of
encroachment, and to determine the same in a sum-
mary way, in addition to other powers conferred on
them, which, however, were restricted to the require-
ments of the small claims then permitted to be
taken up. These matters of encroachment and dis-
putes between adjoining claimholders, were invariably
settled by the commissioner on the ground after per-
sonal inspection; the decision of the commissioner
was final and conclusive, the “ court ” being held in a
rough and ready fashion on the claim itself.

Power of

Local courts.
Wardens of the
goldfields.
The judicial powers of the commissioners were
much enlarged and more clearly defined by the next
following Goldfields Act (6), and in addition to the
powers vested in the commissioners, two justices were
authorised to award damages for encroachment, and
to adjudicate in cases of mining partnerships where
the balance did not exceed £2OO. The procedure in
these cases was as in an ordinary police court.
But as mining extended, tkis means of settling dis-
putes was found to be altogether inefficient for the
purpose of administering justice. It suited the cases
of small claimholders, whose claims were mere shallow
workings and very limited in area, but when a num-
ber of mates banded themselves together and formed
partnerships or companies to work leads and the
deeper alluvial strata, it was seen that something more
was required for the settlement of disputes than the
ipse dixit of a gold commissioner.
Accordingly in June 1855, another Goldfields Act
was passed (c), repealing the former Act, and insti-
tuting certain tribunals known as local courts, con-
sisting of a chairman appointed by the Governor-
in-Council and nine members, each of whom was
required to be the holder of a miner’s right, and was
elected by the general body of miners. These local
courts had power to make regulations, known as local
court regulations, as to the extent and position of
claims, the mode of taking them up, etc., and the local
court regulations were the local laws which answered
the purposes of the present by-laws.
This Act continued in force until the year 1858,
when a further mining Act was passed (d) by which
( b) 17 Vic. No. 4.
(c) 18 Vic. No. 37.
(d) 21 Vic. No. 32.


the local courts were swept away, and in their place
Wardens were appointed for the various mining dis-
tricts established by the Act, with jurisdiction to hear
and determine all suits for encroachment, trespass,
forfeiture and abandonment. This Act also erected
district Courts of Mines with an original jurisdiction
to adjudicate on mining disputes, and a right of
appeal to this court was given to litigants before the
Warden, the right of appeal being also established
from the Court of Mines to the Supreme Court. In
place of the local court regulations authority was
given for the making of by-laws by a mining board
elected for each mining district.
In the year 1865 the mining law was still further
amended by the Mining Statute ( e ), which continues
and enlarges the powers and provisions of the re-
pealed Act No. 82. By Tice Mining Statute 1865 a
new court was erected, styled the Court of the Chief
Judge of Courts of Mines, which was entirely an
appellate court. The Warden or the judge of the
Court of Mines could state a special case for the
opinion of the Chief Judge on any point of law, and
there was also established a right of appeal to the
Court of the Chief Judge from the Court of Mines.
Subsequently, in the year 1L872, an amending Act
was passed (/), principally regulating the machinery
of appeals from the Warden and Court of Mines, and
providing for other necessary amendments of the Act
No. 291.
The Court of the Chief Judge of Courts of Mines
was, however, abolished by The Judicature Act 1883
(, g ), and the jurisdiction theretofore vested in that court

was transferred to the Supreme Court, except as to
pending business at the time the Act came into opera-
tion (July 1, 1884). The right of appeal from the
Court of Mines, and of stating a case by the judge of
that court or by the Warden, given by the Acts No.
291 and No. 440 exists under the present law, except
that such appeal is now made and such special case
stated to the Supreme Court instead of to the Chief
Judge.
These Acts with others have been consolidated in the
present Mines Act, which came into operation on Aug.
1, 1890.
Part I. of The Mines Act is divided into two divi-
sions, viz., (1) Mining Management, and (2) Courts
and Procedure, the former dealing with mining inter-

CHAPTER II.
WARDENS OF THE GOLDFIELDS.
SECTION I.—THE OFFICE OF WARDEN.
Wardens of the goldfields, or more colloquially
Wardens, are appointed in the same manner as jus-
tices of the peace, and within the limits -for which
/.v # ‘ * > ‘ .
tlu-y are appointed have and-exercise the jurisdiction
conferred on them by the Act No. 291 [No. 1120, Part
I, Div. 11. (2) ].
The jurisdiction of the Warden will be considered
subsequently. At the present time the police magis-
trates occupy the position of Wardens in their respec-
tive districts, and the office of Warden is not now,
as formerly, a separate appointment. And there is no
sound distinction betAveen the offices of police magis-
trates and Wardens as to reviewing decisions, or
giving notice of an application for certiorari (a).
The Warden’s tribunal is not strictly speaking a
court, and the Act No. 211 does not apply the term

„cnt,ra y.
“ fcourt ” to the place and manner ot‘ a Warden’s judi-
cial acts (h), though the expression “ Warden’s Court”
is used in the Act No. 446. Though it is usually
spoken of as the “Warden’s Court,” complaints should
he made as before a Warden of the goldfields, and not
in the Warden’s Court.
Though the present practice is to make process
returnable before the Warden at a building occupied
and used as a court house, and though the tribunal is
invariably spoken of as the Warden’s Court, there is
nothing in The Mining Statute 1865 or its amend-
ments [The Mines Act ] to infer that there is any
authority for so doing. The early practice of the
Warden visiting the claim subject of dispute, hearing
evidence and deciding the matter on the spot, is still
countenanced by the Act theoretically, and the Warden
can adjudicate anywhere. He is required to have an
office, bpt this is chiefly for the convenience of suitors,
and for the purposes of the leasing regulations; the
Warden’s office named in the regulations being the
place where he issues his summonses, and not the
court or place where he sits and acts as judge (c).
In its general policy the ijurisdiction given to the
Warden by the Act No. 291 [No. 1120, Part I] seems
to provide for the decision of all disputes between
mining people {cl), and the range of the Warden’s
jurisdiction is of even greater extent than that of the
original jurisdiction of the Court of Mines, which,
however, still retains an inherent right to hear
appeals from the decision of the Warden, or of the
Warden and assessors, on any subject.

The Warden’s Court, to use the popular phrase, is
intended to be a court of quick action between parties
often unrepresented by counsel or attorney (e), and as
such may be placed on an equal footing with the
courts of petty sessions. But though his jurisdiction
is restricted, the Warden is often required to deal
with cases involving rights to property of large value,
and to give decisions which bind those rights (/), so
that though his tribunal is in a manner on a level
with a court of petty sessions, his jurisdiction is
relatively far more extended, and embraces far more
subtle questions than that of the justices.
The duty of a Warden may be regarded as judicial
rather than ministerial, but sec. 166 of the Act No.
291 [No. 1120, sec. 203] classes a Warden with other
officers in such a way as to show that it applies only
to the enforcing of his ministerial acts (g).
SECTION lI.—JURISDICTION OF THE WARDEN.
In addition to the jurisdiction conferred on the
Warden over matters mentioned in sec. 101 of the
Act No. 291 [No. 1120, sec. 135], he has a further
jurisdiction conferred by sec. 177 [No. 1120, sec. 216],
as well as certain special powers and duties under the
Act No. 291 [No. 1120] ; and an additional jurisdiction
is granted to him by The Land Act 1884 (a) and The
Mining on Private 'Property Act 1884 ( h) as regards
gold mining leases of private property, and compensa-

The right of appeal from the decision of the
Warden will be considered in a subsequent chapter.
But with regard to reviewing decisions, or applica-
tions for certiorari, the Supreme Court will interfere
in a mining case with such decision of the Warden
where he has acted without jurisdiction (d), though it
will not do so where he has jurisdiction (e), and the
jurisdiction of the Warden will only be questioned
after he has adjudicated (/). Thus, where the War-
den dismissed a case on a statement that it had been
heard and determined before, which statement was
untrue, it was held that he had already exercised his
jurisdiction, and a mandamus was refused to compel
him to hear the case ( g).
The Warden has jurisdiction in all cases of disputed
ownership of claims (ft) ; and in cases arising between
the Government and claimants under miner’s right as
regards suits for trespass against officials acting
unlawfully on behalf of the Crown, though not
against the Queen herself (i) ; and he had jurisdiction
under sec. 77 of the Act No. 32 to hear and determine
a complaint by a partner claiming an undivided share
in a claim, and to put him in possession, and to decide
the question of partnership (j).

The Warden has also jurisdiction to hear a suit for
trespass by entering on the surface of land in posses-
sion of the complainant as a claim, or under gold
mining lease, and erecting a fence thereon (k). Sec.
37 of the Act No. 291 [No. 1120, sec. 65] also extends
the jurisdiction to cases where a lease is being applied
for, but has not at the time been granted (I) ; he has
jurisdiction to adjudge the forfeiture of a residence
area for nonpayment of i lien, if proceedings are
brought under both 177 and 101 (iii.) of the
Act No. 291 [No. 1120, sees. 135 (iii.) and 216] (in) ;
and the Warden is the proper person to entertain a
complaint under sec. 237. of that Act [No. 1120, sec.
289] for infraction of a by-law (n).
In the case of Wissing v. Finnegan (a) it was held
that the Warden had power to declare a gold mining
lease void, and to place a complainant seeking for-
feiture of such lease in possession of the land as a
claim ; and it was subsequently decided that lie might
entertain a complaint for forfeiture of a gold mining
lease for non-compliance with the labor covenants (p).

Act 1884 (z), The Mining on Private Property Act
1884 (a), The Drainage of Mines Acts 1877 and 1886
(b), and the regulations relating to gold mining leases
has been already discussed, and the powers vested in
the Warden by these Acts and regulations are so
comprehensive and varied that they can only be cur-
sorily mentioned in a work of this nature, and the
reader is referred for fuller information to the enact-
ments and regulations themselves.
The Warden has no power to grant permission to
mine on a public road (c) ; nor has he jurisdiction to
declare ground forfeited where the locus in quo is a
street or road, as such cannot be taken up as a claim
( d ) ; nor has he jurisdiction to enter into a question of
the property in buildings and erections on a residence
area in a complaint for recovery of possession ( e) ; and
the Warden has no jurisdiction over a partnership for
carrying on mining operations on private land (/) ;
nor over a partnership fs to land held under lease
from the Crown (g) ; nor can he entertain a complaint
for damages for forfeiture of shares in a mining com-
pany (h).

cannot entertain a complaint for trespass to land out-
side the boundaries of the complainant’s claim ; in
such a case there would be no privity between the
parties, and the defendant might be a trespasser as
against the Crown, but not as against the com-
plainant.
If the Warden erroneously assumes jurisdiction
such error is a good ground for appeal ( j ), though
where the summons shows excess of jurisdiction, such
summons may be amended by striking out so as to
conform to the evidence ( k ).
The Warden has no jurisdiction to put in possession
of a machinery area a person who is not the holder of
a claim or a water right. A transferree of a machi-
nery area, not being at the time the holder of a claim
is in illegal occupation of it ; and if it be proved
that the defendant is in illegal occupation, tire War-
den can, as against him, put in possession of it the
holder of a claim or a water right (I).

SECTION 111.—PROCEDURE AND PRACTICE BEFORE
THE WARDEN.
(a) Summons.
Every proceeding before the Warden under sec. 177
of the Act No. 291 [No. 1120, sec. 216] must be com-
menced by a summons in the form set forth in the
(i) Rosales v. Rice, 1 V.R. (M.)
1, 1 A.J.R. 13, in which case it
was also held that the Warden
had no jurisdiction in trespass on

area was not land used for min-
ing purposes. But see now Act

schedule to the Act (a), and the summons should
clearly and succintly set out the nature of the relief
sought, and the complainant should state in his sum-
mons that he is the holder of a miner’s right as the
foundation of his title to sue (6).
The practice before the Warden is regulated by the
rules made under The Mining Statute [Mines Act ] (c).
The summons must be issued by the Warden in
whose district, or portion of a district, the subject
matter of dispute, if land or an interest in land, lies,
or where a sole defendant resides ; but if there are
several defendants the suit may proceed before the
Warden in whose district or portion of a district any
of the defendants reside (reg. 1) ; and if a party to a
suit be a corporation or registered company, the office
of such company is substituted for the residences of
individual parties (reg. 26). The summons must be
signed and issued by the Warden, or by the Warden’s
clerk in the name of the Warden (d) ; but where a
summons was signed by the clerk in his own name
and not in the name of the Warden, it was held that
the objection to such summons would be good if taken
before the hearing, but not if taken after appearance
and hearing, and certiorari was refused (e). The
summons must also describe the addresses of com-
plainants with such distinctness as will enable the
Warden and defendants to serve notices upon the
complainants without difficulty (reg. 2).

Description of
land.
Tbe Warden or the Warden and assessors do not
constitute a court, and proceedings should be insti-
tuted “before a Warden of the goldfields,” and not
“in the Wardens Court”; but in an affidavit intituled
“in the Warden’s Court at Ballarat ” the title was
treated as surplusage (/).
It should always be borne in mind in drawing a
plaint summons that the Warden cannot grant more
than he is asked to grant, and consequently no matter
pertinent to the issue should be omitted from it.
Thus, a summons before the'Warden under The Regu-
lation of Mines and Machinery Act 1883 (g) for
injuries sustained was held bad for vagueness in not
alleging which provision of the Act had been con-
travened ; though on the summons being amended to
give the date of the accident, and to refer to the sec-
tion relied on, it was held to give jurisdiction to the
Warden to hear it (h).
And a summons claiming [possession of land “of
which the defendants were in illegal occupation ” was
held to show jurisdiction in tlie Warden, but was too
vague; the objection to the defendants’ title should be
in some degree pointed out. If on such a summons
the objection be taken, the Warden should hear the
objection before the case is opened, and if the com-
plainant should refuse an offer to amend the Warden
should dismiss the summons (i).

mons of the land sought to be recovered, and it is
sufficient to describe it as “ a claim registered in the
books of the mining registrar as defendant’s mining
tenement ” ( j). The usual practice is to describe the
land by the number of the claim in the books of the
mining registrar of the district or division in which it
is registered. In cases of encroachment and trespass
it is sometimes convenient to annex a plan of the
ground to the summons, or the Warden may order a
survey and plan to be made showing the extent of
the encroachment or trespass.
A summons was held good which included two dif-
ferent causes of action, viz., illegal occupation by
reason of an original defect in the title, and forfeiture
of the claim if the title were held good (k). How-
ever, a summons claiming to be put in possession of
portion only of an entire claim alleged to be forfeited
or illegally held should accurately define the portion
possession of which is sought. Ihe Warden has
power to amend by inserting such accurate definition,
but if not so amended the summons should be dis-
missed for vagueness (I).
An objection to the sufficiency of a summons
may be taken before the complainant lias opened his
case (in), but the Warden can amend the summons at
any stage of the hearing (n).

Persons not

hold miners’ rights, or sufficient shareholders to repre-
sent them should be before the Warden (a), and it is
for the Warden to decide., whether one of several
defendants who appears sufficiently represents all the
parties interested (6).
In a proceeding before the Warden for possession of
a claim every defendant must be served, and the War-
den has no power to determine that a defendant not
served is sufficiently represented by those who are
served (c) ; neither has he jurisdiction to make an
order against a person made a party without notice
and notwithstanding his protest (d).
Hut a complainant may make all parties interested
defendants when he does not know whose title will
be set up (e) ; and where some of the parties are
incapacitated, the Warden should strike them out and
confine the proceedings to the proper parties (/).
But where four men have each distinct claims to one
man’s ground, though their individual rights may
have been directly parallel, they cannot be joined as
co-plaintiffs as if the four had a conjoint right in
four claims, and the Warden cannot amend the sum-
mons so as to enable one to sue ( g ).
A person not named in the summons and not served
cannot be heard before the Warden. In a complaint
between A and B, a third party C clearly cannot have
any right to appear as a party, nor by consequence

can he have any right to appeal, or any locus standi
in the appellate court ( h ).
There is no general objection to a complainant
suing before the Warden without making a person for
whom he is a trustee a party {%) ; neither are trustees
for a company necessary parties in a suit for for-
feiture and possession of p claim by or against such
company ( j ); nor is a prior registered owner of a
claim a necessary party to a suit, although he may
not have been removed from the register ( k ).
An assignee, executor or administrator may sue and
be sued before the Warden as if he were a party in
his own right, and an infant may likewise sue and be
sued as if he were of full age (I).
1 1
A complainant, however, should go on with his suit
notwithstanding any change of interests (m), for the
transfer of a claim, or of a share in a claim, and the
registration of it in the name of a party other than
the defendant, or any disposal of any interest or
share in such claim will not in any way affect a suit
commenced before such transfer or registration was
made.
(c) Service of Summons.
A Warden’s summons must be served personally,
or at the dwelling of the defendant, or at the office
of a registered company (reg. 26), upon any person of
years of discretion, or at the place of business of
the defendant upon his servant or agent there em-

ployed, four days before the day of appearance, or
such other time as the Warden may direct, and
which shall be noted at the foot of the summons
(reg. 3).
In a proceeding against] several defendants for
possession of a claim every defendant must be served
personally or by substitution. The Warden cannot
determine that a number of defendants served suffi-
ciently represent one defendant who is not served, and
an order made against a defendant who is not served
will not stand (a) ; and certiorari will be granted to
bring up proceedings before the Warden in order to
have them quashed for non-service of a summons on
one of the defendants ( h); blit appearance will waive
any irregularity as to service 1(c).
An order against one defendant who has been
served and one who has not is bad as against the
unserved defendant, where there is no order for sub-
stituted service; and an unserved defendant who has
not authorised anyone to represent him is not bound
by the appearance qf the other defendants (d).
In case of dispute as to sufficiency of service, or if
the Warden lias any doubt on the matter, he may
hear evidence and decide' whether such service be
good or otherwise, and under special circumstances
appearing by affidavit he may order that a defendant
not served, or insufficiently served, shall be deemed to
be a defendant, upon such terms as he may think tit
(reg. 5).

Where a defendant cannot after diligent enquiry be
found, or cannot from any cause by reasonable exer-
tion be served with the summons, the Warden may, if
satisfied of the facts, order that service be effected
upon such person in such manner as the Warden
by such order shall direct, and may postpone the
hearing of the case to allow of such substituted ser-
vice (e).
An order for substitution of service ought to be
applied for when the summons is returnable. The
Warden has no power to make an order for substi-
tuted service before the return of the summons. He
should adjourn the hearing of the case to admit of the
service in pursuance of his order (/ ), as the order can
only be made at the hearing (</).
The affidavit of service must be endorsed upon or
written under a copy of the summons served, showing-
how service was effected (reg. 4, sched. hi.).
Service on companies registered under The Mining
Companies Act 1871 [Consol. 54 Vic. No. 1074] may
be effected if enclosed in a registered letter addressed
to the manager of such' company at its registered
office, or if left thereat with any person in charge of
the same, or if delivered to the manager or clerk per-
sonally ( h ).
Service of summonses and notices authorised by
the rules may be effected by delivering them to the
attorneys of the parties (reg. 15).

(d) Amendment.
The Warden’s powers of amendment are very
large, and it is almost an accepted maxim that
“ the Warden can amend anything,” so that the sub-
ject matter in dispute between the parties shall
plainly appear (a).
Thus, in a summons for forfeiture of four claims
alleged to be amalgamated, but no amalgamation
being proved, though the Warden cannot adjudicate
on the forfeiture of any one claim and find such one
claim forfeited, he can amend the summons by strik-
ing out the statement as to the amalgamation, and
then adjudicate as to the one claim (b); and where, in
a complaint for forfeiture which did not show under
what by-law the forfeiture was incurred, possession
being claimed by reason of non-compliance with the
by-laws generally, it was held that if no objection
were taken the Warden could adjudicate ; and if the
objection were taken, he could amend (c); and he may
amend a summons seekiig possession of surplus
ground by altering it to om s seeking a declaration of
trespass, and may add co-dejfendants (d).
He may also at the hearing attend a summons by
the addition of any other person ? as complainants or
defendants, or otherwise (e), or b r striking out one or
more of the complainants, upon such terms as he may
think fit (/) ; and he may amend the vagueness in a
summons seeking possession of land “of which the
defendants are in illegal occupation ” by inserting the

objection to the defendant’s title (g) ; he can also
amend the vagueness in a summons claiming to be
put in possession of only portion of an entire claim
alleged to be forfeited by defining the portion posses-
sion of which is sought (/t); and excess of jurisdic-
tion appearing on the face of the summons may be
amended b} r striking out the portion of it which does
not conform to the evidence (i) ; and where a com.
plaint was made under a by-law passed subsequently
to the taking up of a claim, if no objection were
taken the complainants were held entitled to prove
forfeiture under the by-laws applicable, and the
Warden could amend if the objection were taken (j).
The Warden has power to amend a summons at
any stage of the hearing (k).
But where four men, holding distinct titles to one
man’s ground, were joined‘as co-plaintiffs the Warden
was not allowed to amend by changing the summons
by four complainants into summons by one only (I)
and where an application was made to amend a sum-
mons for trespass and encroachment against the
plaintiff’s partner and two other defendants by
changing the complaint tc one of ouster and exclu-
sion against all the defendants, it was held that the
amendment sought was inconsistent with the sum-
mons, and should be refused (m).

(e) Hearing.
The Warden is required as far as practicable to
hear evidence and argument in some court house or
office, and not on the land or locality of the subject of
dispute ; but at his discretion he may hear a com-
plaint and receive evidence and give his decision as to
boundaries, etc., on the ground (reg. 13). He is not
bound to hear a complaint in any particular place ; all
he is required to do is to investigate the matter of the
complaint, and in the presence of all the parties
interested, or such of them as appear to the Warden
sufficiently to represent all the parties interested, or
in the absence of any of them who have been duly
served but do not appear, to hear, receive and examine
evidence, and determine the complaint in a summary
way (a).
The usual practice, howevjer, is for the Warden to
hear and adjudicate on complaints in a court house or
place where courts of petty sessions are usually held,
and if he consider it necesteary he will visit the
ground subject matter of dispute, to inspect it or to
adjust boundaries.
The first evidence necessary to be tendered by a
complainant is his miner’s right, as the foundation of
his right to sue, and it will not be sufficient to pro-
duce the mining register shoWing an entry of the
, number and date of such miner’s right. The books of
the mining registrar are evidence to show the exist-
ence of a miner’s right in a person taking up a claim
as his qualification for taking it up, but not for the
collateral purpose of showing, that he had a miner’s
right at the time of the injury complained of, so as to
entitle him to recover under sec. 246 of the Act No.
(a) Act No. 291, s. 180 [No. 1120, s. 219],


291 [No. 1120, sec. 298]. And a copy ot‘ the mining
register is evidence under sec. 49 [No. 1120, sec. 83] of
the facts recorded in it, but only if shown that the
book in which it is made is directed to be kept by the
regulations under sec. 47 [No. 1120, sec. 81] ( h ); other-
wise the register itself must be produced for the pur-
pose of proving registration of claims, or other
matters requiring registration therein.
Where a person has marked) out as a claim land held
under a gold mining lease alleged to have expired, the
lease may be tendered as evidence against the right of
such person to mark out, and the leasehold title of
the third party may be set up to show the invalidity
of the marking out (c).
It is for the Warden to draw inference of facts
from the evidence which he lears, and the Supreme
Court will not do so on a special case stated (cl),
though on a mere question of fact, if anything turns
upon it, the special case will be remitted to the War-
den to have the point settled (e), and after the
Supreme Court has given an answer to a question, the
appellant may then apply tcj the Warden for a re-
hearing to produce further evidence (/).
On hearing a complaint fot forfeiture, the Warden
ought not to act on evidence given before him in
another case, such as an enquiry concerning the
objections to the granting of a gold mining lease (g).
He can only give his decision in conformity with the

Where, on registration of a claim, a mistake is
made as to the time of marking out, the W 7 arden
should receive evidence tendered to contradict the
statement in the application under which the claim
was registered, and to explain the error therein as to
the time at which possession was actually taken (i).
If the Warden entertair s any doubt as to the ad-
missibility of evidence he may state a special case to
the Supreme Court for the opinion of that court on
the matter (j).
In a complaint before the Warden, after the com-
plainant’s case has been stated, and before he has
called any witnesses, the Warden may call upon the
defendant to state the nature of his defence, and
neither party will be allowed to depart from such
opening statement or defence without leave of the
Warden, (k). But this rule ;does not necessarily re-
quire a complainant to state his case verbally as to
those matters which he ought to have alleged in his
pleadings (I).
The Warden has full power to adjourn the hearing
of a complaint to any other time or place (m).
He has also power to grdnt a re-hearing of any
complaint decided by him, or (by assessors before him,

A party applying for a re-hearing must serve on the
opposite party within seven days from the time the
Warden’s decision was given notice that the applica-
tion will be made at the expiration of two days from
the date of service of such notice, or as soon there-
after as the application can be heard; and if the
Warden grants the application, he will fix the time
and place for the re-hearing, and direct notice thereof
to be given to the parties (n).
Either party to a suit mad previous to or during
the hearing of a complaint apply to the Warden to
inspect the property in dispute, or the Warden may
of his own motion make the inspection, if lie consider
it proper that he should do so ; or he may order a
survey to be made, and the costs of such inspection
or survey will be costs in the cause (o).
(f) Decision and order of the Warden.
The decision of the Warden is regarded as of such
moment that he is required i ’a) to enter a minute of it
in the Warden’s register, a)iid to make an order in
accordance with such decision, and write the same in
the register underneath his decision, and this entry,
drawn up in accordance with sched. XXV. of the Act
No. 291 [No. 1120, sched. NXVIL], is known as the
“ decision of the Warden.”

[No. 1120, sec. 254] (d), and if unreversed is an ad-

The Warden has no discretionary power to refrain

possession of a claim, he is bouhd to put him in posses-
sion of it, otherwise the orde r will be quashed (g) ;

a by-law which provides that a claim may by a com-
petent court be declared forfeited, if the circumstances
appear to him sufficient to justify such a decision (h);
and if a Warden’s order imposes conditions it must
clearly show what the conditions are {i).

defendant who has been served and one who has not,
the whole order is bad and must be quashed (I).
A Warden’s order may be quashed on certiorari
notwithstanding an appeal to the Court of Mines from
the order is pending (m), and certiorari may issue for
nonservice on one defendant, though taken away by
The Mining Statute (n). And an order pronounced
by the Warden after he has refused to state a special
case for the opinion of the Supreme Court is invalid,
and so, not being made in accordance with the Act
No. 291, certiorari may issue to quash it, notwith-
standing sec. 244 of the Act (o). The Supreme Court
will not, however, interfere with the decision of the
Warden when he has jurisdiction to make it {p),
though it will do so where he has no jurisdiction ( q ).
Neither will the Supreme Court interfere when the
Warden has heard and determined a case. So, where
the Warden heard a complaint as to some defendants,
but struck it out as to others! on the ground of want
of jurisdiction, and determined the case in favor of
the complainant as against the other defendants, on
mandamus to compel .him td hear the case as against
the defendants who had been struck out, it was held
that he had exercised his jurisdiction and heard and
determined the complaint, and mandamus was re-
fused (r).

clusive and acts as an est( >ppel (s) ; and where the

Opinion of

Court.
Order

Want of
prosecution.
Warden in his decision, after the Supreme Court has
given an opinion on a question reserved, does not state
any finding on fact, but merely makes an order there-
on, such order does not thereby lose its effect. And
on a fresh summons, the Warden having the identity
of the proceedings before him, nis decision in a former
case is a bar to a second summons (t).
The Warden is bound to give' judgment in accord-
ance with the opinion of the Supreme Court given on
a special case (u); and when the Supreme Court makes
a direction, the duty of the Warden to enter up such
direction is of a judicial nature, and a mandamus
will issue to compel the performance of it (v).
Where the record of the Warden’s decision was
“ case dismissed, having been adjudicated on before,”,
these words were held to mean that the case was
entertained and dismissed, and not dismissed as not
entertained ; the words “ having been adjudicated on
before ” were improperly minuted, and were not part
of the decision, and being outside the decision were
not binding and conclusive on the parties (w).
There is no provision made by the Act for 'dismis-
sing a suit for want of prosecution; the Warden
cannot dismiss a summons where the party taking out
the summons does not proceed with the case. He can
only strike it out ( x ). And under the Act No. 291 he

could not give costs in such a case, a power which is
now conferred on him by the Act No. 446, sec. 17 [No.
1120, sec. 281]. A complainant may, however, at any
stage serve notice in writing of his intention to dis-
continue, and the defendant may then proceed for his
costs (reg. 14).
Under The Goldfields Act (No. 32) sec. 84, when the
Warden dismissed a complaint, there was no appeal to
the Court of Mines (y) ; but otherwise where he
decided that no encroachment had been committed;
in such a case the Court of Mines could make and
enforce an order (z).
For the purposes of sec. 23 of the Act No. 446 [No.
1120, sec. 266] an order of the Warden is deemed to
be made when he announces his intention to make it,
and an application to state a special case on a point of
law for the opinion of the Supreme Court made after-
wards, and before the order is entered in the register,
is too late (a).
(g) Enforcing Decision.
Where by the decision of the Warden or the War-
den and assessors any sum of money is awarded by
way of debt damages, costs, or otherwise, the order
may be enforced by warrant of execution which is to
be executed by the bailiff of the Court of Mines. The
Warden may withhold the issuing of the warrant

on which the decision was made, if he consider it just
and reasonable to do so (No. 291, sec. 200) [No. 1120,
sec. 242].
Where the Warden’s decision is not an order for
payment of money the person entitled to the benefit
of such decision may on disobedience of the Warden’s
order obtain a summons from the Warden requiring
the party so disobeying the order to appear and show
cause why he should not be committed to prison for
disobedience of such order On return of the sum-
mons the Warden will enquire into the matters men-
tioned in the summons, and may, if he think fit, order
such party to be committed to prison (No. 291, sec.
207) [No. 1120, sec. 249]. The order of commitment
may, if warranted by special circumstances, be made
exparte and without notice, on affidavit only of the
wilful disobedience of the Warden’s order (No. 291,
sec. 209) [No. 1120, sec. 251],
A person so committed may be discharged from cus-
tody on such conditions as to performance of so much
of the Warden’s order as remains to be and is capable
of being performed as the Warden or a judge of the
Court of Mines may direct (No. 291, sec. 208) [No.
1120, sec. 250],
A certificate in the form bf schedule xxviii [xxx]
may be obtained from the Warden when any sum of
money awarded by him by way of debt, damages or
costs shall remain unsatisfied, which certificate may
be filed with the clerk of the Court of Mines of the
district, and thereupon execution may issue as upon a
decree or order of that court (No. 291, sec. 210) [No.
1120, sec. 252],


(h) Costs.
In suits before the Warden where the complainant
recovers a demand of less value than £2O, costs are in
the discretion of the Warden (a), but they must not
exceed the costs allowed by rules 22, 23, 24 ; and a
baxation of costs by the Warden in a lump sum with-
out reference to items, or to any scale of costs, may be
good, provided the amount does not exceed what
would be allowed item by item under the scale (5).
Where a complaint is struck out for want of juris-
diction the Warden has power to award costs in the
same manner and to the same extent as if he had
jurisdiction in the matter of such complaint, and the
complainant had not appeared, or had appeared and
failed to prove his case (c).
Costs and expenses to surveyors, accountants, engin-
eers, and other scientific persons whose assistance is
obtained by the Warden, are fixed by him in his dis-
cretion, and are payable in such manner as he may
direct (reg. 25).
Costs of interlocutory proceedings, applications for
injunction or inspection, &c., are in the discretion of
the Warden.
SECTION IV.—THE WARDEN AND ASSESSORS.

and any party to a suit may require the complaint to
be heard before the Warden and four assessors, who
virtually form a jury of practical miners {a).
In a hearing before the Warden and assessors the
matter in dispute is settled by the assessors with the
assistance of the Warden on any point of law, and
the decision of the majority of the assessors has the
same force and effect as a decision of the Warden if
acting alone would have. But a verdict of assessors
not followed by a judgment of the Warden is not
admissable as a verdict for any purpose, and is not of
any weight as a finding (6).
A hearing before the Warden and assessors re-
sembles proceedings on a trial before a judge and jury
(c), though if the assessors cannot agree upon a verdict
the Warden is required to decide the complaint him-
self, and not to order a fresh trial before another jury
of assessors. If, however, the assessors find a verdict,
the order should be made as by the Warden on the
finding of the assessors ( d ).
An appeal to the Court of Mines lies from the
decision of the Warden on the finding of assessors (e)
in the same manner as if such decision were given by
the Warden acting alone, and the appeal is prosecuted
by the same procedure.
Where the assessors returned an unintelligible ver-
dict and the Warden entered up no decision, but called

Ither assessors, who found for the complainant, it was
ield on mandamus to compel the Warden to enter the
r erdict of the first assessors, that on the first trial
here had been no finding, and that the second finding
hould stand, but that the Warden should have
lecided the case by his casting vote when the asses-
lors were equally divided, and have entered up the
lecision accordingly (/).
SECTION V.—SPECIAL POWERS OF THE WARDEN.
In addition to the jurisdiction confered on the War-
den by secs. 101 and 177 of the Act No. 291 [No.
1120, secs. 135 and 216], he has certain special powers
vested in him which in the administration of justice
in regard to practical mining he is frequently called
upon to exercise (a).
The most important special power vested in the
Warden is that of issuing an injunction order to
restrain encroachment or trespass upon or interference
with any claim whereby the right or title of the
applicant for the injunction may be affected (sec. 203)
[No. 1120, sec. 245].
He has also the power in cases of pressing emer-
gency to make an ex parte order of injunction to be
in force for seven days (sec. 204) [No. 1120, sec. 246].
These injunction orders, commonly known as interim
injunctions, as well as injunction orders under sec. 203
[No. 1120, sec. 245] are temporary and interlocutory,

• and should be limited to time, but they may be made
- perpetual on the final order or decree ( h ).
Where an application is made for an injunction
order under sec. 203 [No. 1120, sec. 245] twenty-four
hours’ notice must be given to the parties interested
in opposing the application ; and the order can be
made on affidavits (c). But all persons giving notice
of application for the injunction must appear before
the Warden in support of it, or he should dismiss if;
and quwre whether he has power to amend by striking
out the names of those who do not appear ( d ).
In drawing up the injunction order it is necessary
to show on the face of it the matters necessary to give
the Warden jurisdiction to make it, otherwise the
order will be invalid, and disobedience of it will not
be an offence under section 207 [No. 1120, sec. 249]
(e). The order when made must be served personally
on the person to be bound thereby (sec. 206) [No.
1120, sec. 248], or, if the Warden so orders, it may be
served by publication in a newspaper or by affixing a
copy thereof in some conspicuous place at or near the
property in dispute (/).
The Warden has also a special power to make an
order authorising a surveyor or an experienced miner
to enter upon any claim or lease adjoining the claim
or lease of the person applying for such order, for the
purpose of inspecting the same, and to discover
whether encroachment is being committed, the person
so appointed to enter and inspect being required first

to make a declaration that he will not divulge any ]
information obtained on any such inspection beyond
the fact of the encroachment (sec. 202) [No. 1120, sec.
244]. And it is essential that such declaration not to
divulge shall be made by the person inspecting, before
disobedience of the Warden’s order will become an
offence under sec. 207 [No. 1120, sec. 249] (g).
The Warden is also authorised at the time of
making his decision to order the delivery of any
auriferous earth in satisfaction or part satisfaction of
a debt ordered by him by such decision to be paid,
and may cause such auriferous earth to be seized and
delivered accordingly (sec. 201) [No. 1120, sec. 248];
and he may also order any auriferous earth or gold to
be deposited in the name of the Warden, or of any
other person, to abide the final decision in the matter
of the complaint before him (sec. 205) [No. 1120, sec.

CHAPTER III.
DISTRICT COURTS OF MINES.
Bk. IV. Chap. 111.
Sec. I.
Creation of
Courts of
Mines.
Under Act No.
291.
SECTION I.—THE COURT OF MINES.
Though the summary proceedings before the gold-
fields commissioners or Wardens were regarded in the
earlier days of the colony as sufficient to determine
any dispute as to the title or the boundaries of small
claims, yet with the progress of the mining industry
it was felt that some more responsible tribunal was
required for settlement of disputes relating to more
valuable mining properties, and involving principles of
equity which a Warden or goldfields commissioner
could not he expected to be competent to deal with.
Accordingly, Courts of Mines were first created by
The Goldfields Act (a) in the year 1857.
The Courts of Mines were continued by the Act No.
291, and their jurisdiction and powers considerably
enlarged, and further powers were vested in the
judges of these courts to make interlocutory, injunc-
tion and other orders. Besides being in itself a Court
(a) Act No. 32, s. 14.


of appeal from the decision of the Warden, the Act
gives litigants in the Court of Mines a right of appeal
to the Supreme Court [formerly to the Chief Judge of
Courts of Mines], and the judge has also the power to
state a special case for the opinion of the Supreme
Court [Chief Judge] on any question of law arising
before him.
Titles to claims and leases existed before the passing
of the Act No. 291, but were put on a different foot-
ing by that Act, which created the present Court of
Mines. The Supreme Court has a concurrent juris-
diction with the Courts of Mines as to these titles,
It has been exercised in Mulcahy v. Walhalla Go. (h).
which was confirmed on appeal to the Privy Council
(c) and in various other cases. They are courts of
co-ordinate jurisdiction, though of unequal dignity
(d) and stand in relation to the Supreme Court on the
footing of inferior courts ( e ).
The Court of Mines under the Act No. 32 was a
Court of Equity pure and simple (/), but though it
did not possess a common law jurisdiction it was
governed by the same principles which guide the
Supreme Court. The present Court of Mines is a
court of both law and equity ( g ). The laws of evi-
dence are the same as those of the Supreme Court;
the rules for the interpretation of law are the same ;
and so long as the court acts within the jurisdiction
conferred on it by the statute, the Supreme Court will

not interfere with it. Of course, where the jurisdic-
tion is exceeded, the Supreme Court will interfere (h).
A Court of Mines is established within and for each
mining district, which court is the Court of Mines for
that district, and has no jurisdiction beyond its limits,
though the judge may sit either in court or in cham-
bers at any place in Victoria, and no judgment, rule,
decree or order of any judge can be set aside by reason
that the same was made without the territorial limits
of the court (i).
The colony of Victoria is divided into seven mining
districts, each having its own Court of Mines. The
districts are:
1. Ballarat, containing the divisions of Balla-
rat, Buninyong, Creswick, Smythe’s Creek,
Blackwood, and Steiglitz.
2. Beechworth, containing the divisions of
Beechworth, Indigo, Yackandandah, Buck-
land, Goulburn, and Mitta Mitta.
3. Sandhurst, containing the divisions of Sand-
hurst, Ray wood, Heathcote, Waranga, and
Kilmore.
4. Maryborough, containing the divisions of
Maryborough, Amherst, Avoca, Dunolly, Tar-
nagulla, Korong, and St. Arnaud.
5. Castlemaine, containing the divisions of
Castlemaine, Fryer’s Creek, Taradale, Tar-
rengower, Hepburn, and St. Andrews.
6. Ararat, containing the divisions of Ararat,
Pleasant Creek (Stawell), Raglan, and Barkly.

s. 118].


7. Gipps Land, containing the divisions of String-
er’s Creek, Russell’s Creek, Omeo, Mitchell
River, Crooked River, Jericho, and Don-
nelly’s Creek.
Each of these mining districts has also its own
mining board, empowered to make by-laws for its
district generally, or for any individual division of
such district.
SECTION II —JURISDICTION OF THE COURT OF MINES.
Every Court of Mines has original jurisdiction to
hear and determine all suits cognizable by a court of
law or by a court of equity concerning any of the
matters specified in sec. 101 of the Act Ao. 291 [ho.
1120, sec. 135] (a).
Under the Act No. 32, sec. 27, the jurisdiction of
the Court of Mines was expressly limited to matters
cognizable by a court of equity ( h ), but it may undei
its present constitution determine all suits cognizable
by a court of law as well.
Where the Court of Mines has acted within its
jurisdiction the Supreme Court will not interfere,
although it may have acted wrongly (c); and where a
judge has a statutory discretion to hear an appeal
from the Warden or not, the Supreme Court will not
grant TYicLTiddWsUS directing him to exercise his juiis-
diction, where he has already in exercise of his statu-

tory discretion refused to do so, however harshly such
discretion may have been exercised (d) ; and the
Supreme Court, though having a concurrent jurisdic-
tion with the Court of Mines, will not generally
exercise such jurisdiction in matters within the juris-
diction of the latter court (e).
Under both the Acts No. 32 and No. 291 the judge
of the Court of Mines had no jurisdiction to decide
outside the territorial limits of his district in a matter
otherwise within such limits (/), though if the judge,
with the consent or at the request of the parties,
allowed them to attend him out of the jurisdiction of
his court to hear his reasons and conclusions, there
was nothing to prevent him, being afterwards within
his jurisdiction, from giving his formal order, formally
signed, to the proper officer to be duly recorded (g).
However, sec. 8 of the Act No. 446 [No. 1120, sec.
118] now empowers a judge to sit in court or in
chambers, and make decrees and orders, outside the
territorial limits of his district.
The Court of Mines has no jurisdiction in a suit
between two companies to order the defendant com-
pany to produce for inspection the books of another
company not a party to the suit ( h ) ; nor had it power
under The Insolvency Statute 1865 (t) to expunge a
proof of debt ( j ).

The jurisdiction given to the Court of Mines does
not oust the jurisdiction of other courts otherwise
having jurisdiction in the matter in dispute, on the
ground that all Her Majesty’s courts are open to all
Her Majesty’s subjects. So the fact that the Act No.
291 has provided a special remedy for any interference
with the possession of land held under miner’s right
does not oust the jurisdiction of the County Court to
entertain an action of trespass in respect of such
interference (k).
In addition to the jurisdiction conferred on the
Court of Mines by the Act No. 291 the Court has
been given a further jurisdiction by The Mining on
Private Property Act 1884 (I), which has been
already considered (m). It has also a further juris-
diction conferred on it by Tlte Mining Companies
Act 1871 (n), but the jurisdiction exercised by the
court under this Act and under the Act No. 291 [No.
1120] are separate and distinct jurisdictions. Thus
the Court of Mines exercises two jurisdictions, viz.,
that given by The Alining Statute [The Alines Act ] and
that by The Alining Companies Act, but each is
separate and distinct from the other (o). As, how-
ever, the matter of the jurisdiction of the Court of
Mines under the latter Act does not come within the
scope of this work, the question need not be further
discussed. It may, however, be said that whenever
by any other Act jurisdiction is conferred on the
Court of Mines, the provisions of the Act No. 291
[No. 1120] if applicable, attach as to procedure (p).

The proceedings and practice of the Court of Mines
are regulated by the Act No. 291 [No. 1120, Part 1.,
Div. 2(1)] ( a ) and by the rules promulgated under sec.
86 of that Act [No. 1120, sec. 120] (6).
Every suit is commenced by a plaint in writing and
is prosecuted without written pleadings, unless the
leave of the judge be obtained to prosecute such suit
with written pleadings (sec. 105) [No. 1120, sec. 139] ;
and on the plaint is endorsed a summons to appear at
the court on the day on which the court shall first sit
next after the expiration of fifteen days from the ser-
vice of the summons (sec. 109), i.e., the summons must
be served fifteen clear days before the return day ( c ).
The suit must be commenced in the district and
division where the subject matter of dispute, if land
or an interest in land, lies, and where a sole defendant
resides, but if there are several defendants the suit
may proceed in the district and division in which any
of them reside (reg. 1).

however, refer to appeals from

Every defendant must be served with the plaint
and summons (sec. Ill) [No. 1120, sec. 145], and the
court has power to decide (sec. 142) [No. 1120, sec.
178] whether defendants who appear sufficiently
represent those who do not appear (d). Service may
be effected either personally, or at the dwelling of the
defendant upon any inmate of years of discretion, or
at the place of business of the defendant upon his
servant or agent there employed (reg. 2) ; and an affi-
davit of service must be endorsed on or written under
a copy of the plaint and summons (reg. 3).
In prosecuting a suit with written pleadings by
leave of the judge, a practice which is seldom adopted,
the mode of procedure is laid down in secs. 115-123,
125, 129 and 135 of the Act No. 291 [No. 1120, secs.
149-161, 165 and 171].
The plaint must set forth as briefly as shall be con-
sistent with clearness a statement of the facts on
which the plaintiff relies, divided into paragraphs
numbered consecutively, and must conclude with a
prayer for relief. A plaint is objectionable which
comprises land held under different titles, as being
partly held under miner’s right and partly under
lease, or which makes co-plaintiffs persons who are
not interested at all ( e ).
Every summons and every affidavit of service must
be sealed with the seal of the court, and erasures and
interlineations in an affidavit of service must be ini-
tialed, otherwise such an omission is a good ground
for dismissing the plaint, and appearance to take the
objection is not a waiver (/). But sec. 100 of the

Act No. 291 [No. 1120, sec. 134], requiring process to
be sealed with the seal of the court, refers to a process
in a suit, and applies only to something by which the
suit is advanced ; and a judge’s summons to show
cause why plaintiff should not be placed on the regis-
ter of a company was held sufficient though sealed
with a wrong seal (g).
A solicitor may appear under protest and take
objection to the plaint ( h ), and such appearance will
not be deemed a waiver of the objection taken ( i ).
It is not necessary in order to maintain a suit for
forfeiture of a claim that the plaintiff should show
that the defendant either is or claims to be in posses-
sion of the claim. “By the Act No. 291, sec. 101 (i.)
[No. 1120, sec. 135 (i.)] the jurisdiction seems limited
to land in which some person other than the plaintiff
shall be or shall claim under miner’s right to be en-
titled to be in occupation or possession. This does
not mean that no person can be made a defendant
who claims no right, etc. Plaintiffs are often at a loss
to find who are the real claimants, especially where
they are enforcing forfeiture against those who
neglect to work and absent themselves from the claim,
and they can only feel secure as to their title acquired
by summons by serving all those who have possession
or any pretence of right ” ( j). But a plaint is bad
which joins as co-plaintiffs parties who are not inter-
ested at all ( k).

The judge has power on an appeal from the Warden
to order that an appellant’s name be struck out from
all proceedings in his court, and that all proceedings
be set aside as to such appellant, in a case in which he
was made a party without his authority or know-
ledge ( I ).
If objection for want of parties be taken in a suit
prosecuted with written pleadings, the judge may
amend upon terms (sec. 115) [No. 1120, sec. 149].
The judge has also power to amend a plaint or
answer for uncertainty, obscurity or repugnance (sec.
120) [No. 1120, sec. 156], or if the answer is ineffec-
tual by reason of omission, or erroneous or incon-
gruous statement of fact (sec. 127) [No. 1120, sec-
-163].
He may also amend in cases of misjoinder (sec. 130,
reg. 12) [No. 1120, sec. 166], and such amendment may
be made at any stage of the case. Thus, where
lessees and tributers sued for encroachment, and the
evidence showed that the encroachment was after the
letting on tribute, the judge was allowed to amend the
plaint by striking out the lessees as plaintiffs, and to
make a decree for the tributers (m).
A general power of amendment is given by secs.
132 and 133 [No. 1120, secs. 168, 169], but this refers
to proceedings originated in the Court of Mines, and
not to appeals; the judge cannot amend a form of
appeal (n). And before making any amendment the
judge should defer the exercise of his discretion until
all the facts are disclosed (o).

In the case of a suit prosecuted without written
pleadings the suit is heard and determined by the
court in a summary way, and the defendant may in
such a suit obtain any cross relief which he could
have obtained had a suit been instituted by himself
(sec. 124) [No. 1120, sec. 160].
Either party may require the issues and questions
of fact to be tried before the court and six assessors,
who are to be summoned as before mentioned, and the
verdict of a majority of them will be received (secs.
136, 137) [No. 1120, secs. 172, 173]. If, however, a
majority of the assessors fail to agree on a verdict
within six hours after the case is left to them they
are discharged, and another day appointed for a trial,
each party bearing his own costs (reg. 18). Where
issues have been settled for trial by assessors the
parties should not be allowed in argument to go out-
side those issues (p) ; and in a case heard before the
court and assessors the judge cannot disregard the
finding of the assessors, even though they find against
his direction ( q ). The procedure before the court and
assessors is similar to that before a judge and jury.
The judge of a Court of Mines cannot refuse to act
as such. Where he is vested with authority to hear a
case he is bound to exercise that authority when called
on, otherwise he might refuse to try cases he did not
wish to try. A judge cannot exercise discretion in
such cases ; he is bound to try the cases over which
he has jurisdiction (r).

has been pronounced the party in whose favor the

draw it up, after which it is settled and signed by the
judge, and thereupon becomes effective and enforceable
by the process of the court (sec. 145) [No. 1120, sec.
181] unless stayed or appealed against (s).
The Act No. 291 [No. 1120] contemplates only one
decree, and when that is drawn up and signed by the
judge it is enforceable at once, unless appealed against
(t) ; and the Act does not provide for the judge of the
Court of Mines making a decree to account (u). After
the decree is drawn up by the clerk of the court any
party objecting to its terms may apply to the judge to
settle it, and when settled and signed it becomes
effective (v) ; and the decree should be signed by the
person who was judge at its date (w).
The opinion of the Chief J udge [Supreme Court] is
not a decree of the Court of Mines; the decree itself
must be drawn up from the opinion and signed by the
judge of the latter court (j?).
Where a decree made by the judge of the Court of
Mines was varied by the Chief Judge, and was subse-
quently quashed on certiorari, but the order varying
it was not quashed, it was held that the judge of the
Court of Mines ought not to refuse to hear the cause
on the ground that the decree had not been quashed ;

that when the decree was quashed all the subsequent
proceedings depending on it fell with it, and manda-
mus was granted to compel the judge to proceed with
the hearing ( y ).
It seems that the power of the judge of the Court
of Mines to make a decree reserving the rights of
absent defendants should be exercised only on his own
doubts as to the justice of the case against them, and
not on the objection of other defendants (0).
A plaintiff cannot run the double chance of obtain-
ing a decision in his favor on a point of law and of
falling back afterwards on the merits of the case. If
a person asks for a nonsuit he is not allowed after-
wards to set that nonsuit aside (a).
Where the judge by his decree declared that en-
croachment had been committed and that accounts
should be taken, and on appeal the Chief Judge varied
the decree, but only as to the extent of the encroach-
ment, and remitted it to the judge below, who pro-
ceeded to take accounts, it was held on motion for
prohibition that the judge is not at liberty to take
accounts after having made his decree. He must con-
clude the hearing before making the decree, leaving
nothing more to be done than what is plainly minis-
terial, and taking accounts is not a ministerial pro-
ceeding; it is quasi judicial (b).

any proceeding before the judge, may appeal to the

order (sec. 172) [No. 1120, sec. 210], but no appeal
will lie from an order of the judge of the Court of
Mines setting aside his former decree and directing a
new trial (c). The judge may also reserve any ques-
tion of law in the form of a special case (sec. 171)
[No. 1120, sec. 209] for the opinion of the Chief Judge
[Supreme Court], and the judge must make his decree
in accordance with sucli opinion ( d ). But he may not
decide a case first, and then state a special case for the
opinion of the Supreme Court (e), though the hearing
of the case must be completed before any such ques-
tion is stated (/).
The judge of the Court of Mines may also grant a
rehearing or new trial of questions of fact, and may
if he think lit require such questions to be tried by
assessors (sec. 170) [No. 1120, sec. 207]. An order for
a new trial, however, is not such an order as concludes
the merits, on the principle of following out the policy
adopted in the Privy Council that appeal is only
allowed where the merits of the case are con-
cluded ( g ).
The power of the Supreme Court to issue a writ of
certiorari to bring up proceedings of an inferior
court has been taken away by sec. 244 of the Act No.
291 [No. 1120, sec. 296], but the effect of this clause is
not absolutely to deprive the Supreme Court of its
power to issue a writ of certiorari in mining cases,
but to control and limit its action on such writ (h),

which may be issued to bring up proceedings which
are invalid as not being properly taken under the Act
No. 291 [No. 1120] (i).
But though standing on the footing of an inferior
court, the Court of Mines has concurrent jurisdiction
with the Supreme Court on certain subjects ( j ), and
the decision of the Court of Mines cannot be altered
or varied by the Supreme Court by way of review
for error, or on further discovery of evidence, and
pendency of a case in the Court of Mines will stop
the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court on the same
subject ( k ). But the Supreme Court is bound to grant
mandamus when satisfied that there will be a failure
of justice if it be not granted (I), though the Supreme
Court will not interfere with an order of the Court of
Mines by prohibition where it has exercised its juris-
diction (m), even though the order may be bad (n).
The judge has a discretionary power to award costs,
which are taxed according to the scale in the general
rules (o), and he may assess and award costs in an
interlocutory application (p). The judge can give
costs in his discretion as between party and party or
as between solicitor and client, and he is required at
the time of the hearing or of giving his decision to
tax them (sec. 230) [No. 1120, sec. 280]. Where, how-

decree could not be quashed by certiorari, but that
the proper remedy was by appeal ( q ).
The judge may in any case where a court of equity
might do so make an order for staying proceedings
until security shall have been given for costs (sec.
144) [No. 1120, sec. 180].
SECTION IV.—INTERLOCUTORY ORDERS.
The judge of the Court of Mines is vested with
power to make interlocutory and other orders as may
seem just, in addition to the jurisdiction conferred on
the Court of Mines.
He may grant injunctions against encroachment
and trespass pending suit, and until the hearing and
determination, or pending appeal, or until further
order of the judge or of the court (sec. 158) [No.
1120, sec. 195] and generally he has the same powers
in suits, appeals and proceedings in the Court of
Mines of granting injunction orders as are vested in
the Supreme Court, or one of its judges (sec. 159)
[No. 1120, sec. 196] ; and the court may issue an
injunction in a suit originating before the Warden
and transferred to the Court of Mines, without the
necessity of a suit being instituted in the latter court
(a) ; and in any suit in the Court of Mines the judge
may grant an injunction (sec. 160) [No. 1120, sec. 197]
against proceeding in any other court (6).

Any person desirous of appealing from the decision
of the W 7 arden may appeal to the Court of Mines for
the district, at that sitting of such court which next
after the expiration of one month ( a) from the day of
making such decision shall be held nearest to the
place at which such decision shall have been made,
provided that ten days’ (b) notice is given to the other

make interlocutory orders see

side, or such of them as shall represent till the parties
interested, stating the intention to appeal, and the
grounds of appeal, and the time and place at which
such appeal will be heard. If the parties cannot be
found on whom to serve the notice, it must be served
on the Warden. A deposit of £lO must also be made
with the clerk of the court to abide the costs of the
appeal (c).
When the date of the sitting of the Court of Mines
is not tixed, it will be sufficient if the notice of appeal
be “ for the next court which after the expiration of
one month ” shall be held, without naming a date (d) ;
but it is not sufficient when an erroneous date is
named in the notice for the sitting of the court (e).
Under section 70 of The Goldfields Act (No. 32) the
judge had power to grant only one rehearing of a
hearing or an appeal (/), but under The Mining
Statute (No. 291), sec. 170, [No. 1120, sec. 207] the
court or judge may grant a rehearing of a suit or of
an appeal as often as such court or judge shall deem
proper.
(a) Basis of Appeal.
Under the Act No. 32 no appeal woilld lie where
the Warden declined to make an order for possession,
and dismissed the case (a), but by sec. 212 of the Act
No. 291 [No. 1120, sec. 254] provision is made for
appeal whether the decision of the Warden be a dis-
missal of the case or otherwise.

The basis of appeal is the decision of the Warden,
and that only, and where the Warden sits with asses-
sors appeal lies from his decision in the same manner
as if such decision were given by the Warden sitting
alone ( b ), though there is no appeal from the finding
of the assessors on questions of fact; the only remedy
for a misfinding of assessors is a new trial (c). But if
the finding of the assessors is minuted as the decision
of the case, the finding of the assessors and the order
made in pursuance of it become the decision and order
of the Warden, and appeal will lie ( d).
In a case where questions of fact are to be tried by
assessors on appeal (e) the judge has the same power
of settling such questions as he would have in his
original jurisdiction under sec. 137 [No. 1120, sec.
173] (/)•
The Court of Mines can hear an appeal on a ques-
tion of the jurisdiction of the Warden, and may
reverse the Warden’s order if made without jurisdic-
tion (g) ; and appeal will lie to the Court of Mines
from the decision of the Warden under the Act No.
291, sec. 177 [No. 1120, sec. 216], in respect of a sum
under £lOO claimed as accruing from a joint mining
adventure between complainant and defendant (h).

was not so under the Act No. 32, as in a case under
that Act where the Warden’s decision was “case dis-
missed, having been adjudicated on before,” it was
held that the words “ case dismissed ” must be taken
to mean that the case was entertained and dismissed,
and not dismissed as not entertained, and that the lat-
ter words of the decision were surplusage, and on this
ground that the Court of Mines had jurisdiction to
hear an appeal against such decision (j).
An appeal should he practically a rehearing ( k ), and
the appellant is entitled to prove another and different
case to that proved before the Warden, but he should
he confined to the grounds stated in his notice of ap-
peal, subject to the relaxation of sec. 216 of the Act
No. 291 [No. 1120, sec. 260] (I).
The appeal must in the first instance be to the
Court of Mines for the district within which the
decision appealed from was pronounced, held nearest
to the place where such decision of the Warden was
made, though the appeal may be heard at any place
within the district (m), and it may be assumed that
“ nearest ” means as the crow flies ( n ).
A complainant does not lose his right to proceed
with a# appeal by assigning his rights in the claim
in dispute pending the appeal (o). And it is sufficient
if the parties to the proceedings before the Warden
are before the appellate court (p). Persons who are

There is no appeal from an order of commitment
under sec. 151 of the Act No. 291 [No. 1120, sec. 188],
as a special remedy is provided by sec. 156 [No. 1120,

[Supreme Court] from an order dismissing a’ sum-
mons for commitment under sec. 155 [No. 1120, sec.

(h) Notice of Appeal.
It is essential that the notice of appeal state (1) the
intention to appeal, (2) the grounds of appeal, and (3)
the time and place at which the appeal will be heard.
The appellant will be confined to the grounds stated in
his notice (a), and the appeal must be to the court
held nearest to the place where the decision appealed
from was pronounced, though it need not necessarily
be heard at that court ( h ).
The appeal must be made at that sitting of the
court held next after the expiration of one month
from the making of the decision. If the date of the
sitting of the Court of Mines is not fixed and pub-
licly announced, a party omitting the actual date of
the hearing of the appeal from his notice is not

The notice of appeal must be served on the parties
interested in supporting the decision appealed from,
or upon such of them as shall appear to the Court of
Mines sufficient to represent all the parties
within ten days from the day of making the decision.
If no such person can be found upon whom to
serve the notice it must be served on the Warden by
whom the decision was made (sec. 212) [No. 1120, sec.
254],
The notice of appeal must be in writing in the form
of schedule xxxix. of the Act No. 291 [No. 1120,
schedule xxxi.].
Notice of appeal must be headed in the district in
which the decision was made (e), but if headed in the
wrong division of the district such an error is mere
surplusage, and not fatal to the notice, as the title of
the Court of Mines appealed to will be sufficient if
the district is plainly indicated on the notice (/),
though the notice will be bad if headed in the court
of a mining district which does not exist, and the
judge has no power to amend ( g ).
A notice of appeal headed for trial by assessors, ■
and setting out the grounds of the appeal, but not any
question of issue or fact which the appellant requires
to be tried by assessors, is not a sufficient notice of
trial by assessors under the Act No. 291, sec. 217 [No.

The date of the decision appealed from should be
correctly stated in the notice (i), which should de-
scribe the decision by both date and place ; the head-
ing of the Warden’s order containing the name of the
place is not sufficient (j).
All documents on an appeal from the Warden
should be headed as between appellant and re-
spondent, and not as between complainant and de-
fendant ( k ).
The judge has no power, after the expiration of the
time allowed for appeal, to extend the time (I), but
the time for notice of appeal and deposit of money
may be enlarged by verbal consent of the parties (m).
Sundays and holidays must not be excluded from
the computation of time for giving notice of appeal;
if the last day falls on a Sunday notice of appeal
given on Monday is bad (n).
Notice of appeal is good, though not actually signed
by the appellants, or as on their behalf (o) ; it is suffi-

ney, but by his clerk (r). But the name of the appel-
lant must appear at the foot of the notice; a signature
by an attorney “for and on behalf of the above-
named appellants ” is not sufficient (s).
Service of notice of appeal cannot be effected on an
unauthorised agent of the respondent ( t ), but if either
party appear before the Warden by attorney, notice
of appeal may be served on such attorney (u), though
service on an attorney by leaving the notice with an
inmate of his private house is not good service ( v ).
It should be served on him personally, or on a clerk
at his office.
When service of notice on the Warden is resorted
to, he must be served within the time limited by the
Act No. 446, sec. 18 [No. 1120, sec. 254] (ten days).
Service on him at his residence, or on his clerk at his
office, is sufficient ( w ), but* not on an inmate of his
private residence (x).
If it be shown to the Warden by affidavit that a
person named as a respondent in a notice of appeal
cannot be found, and cannot by reasonable exertion
be served with the notice within the time limited, the
Warden may make an order for substitution of

service on him ( y ). Under the Act No. 32, sec. 84, an
order for substituted service of an appeal summons
might be made by the judge at the hearing, and it
was for the judge to say whether all parties should be
served, or such only of them as appeared to him suffi-
cient to represent all (z).
Respondents on appeal have the right to object to
defective service of notice on themselves or others,
and to examine and give evidence upon controverted
facts as to service (a). The question whether a person
served with notice of appeal sufficiently represents all
the respondents is a matter for the discretion of the
judge, and service of a notice to produce a document
at the hearing of the appeal is not a waiver of an
objection to the service of the notice of appeal (b).
(c) Hearing of Appeal.
An appeal from the decision of the Warden is heard
before the Court of Mines in the same manner as a
suit originating in that court at such sitting of the
court or at such other place within the mining dis-
trict and at such time as the judge shall by writing
under his hand direct; and the order on the appeal is
final (Act No. 291, sec. 213) [No. 1120, sec. 257],
On the hearing of an appeal, after the appellant
has stated his case, and before calling witnesses, the
judge may call upon the respondent to state the
nature of his defence, and .neither party will be per-
mitted to depart from his opening statement, without
leave of the judge ( aa ).

Either party may require an appeal to be tried
before the court and six assessors (Act No. 291, sec.
217) (No. 1120, sec. 261], in which case the hear-
ing is proceeded with in the same manner as a suit in
the Court of Mines (sec. 218) [No. 1120, sec. 262].
The appellant must state in his notice requiring the
appeal to be heard before assessors what question or
issue of fact they are required to try.
In the case of Stevens v. Webster ( b ) it was held
that on an appeal from the Warden to the Court of
Mines the appellant should have the right to begin,
whether he were complainant or defendant in the
court below ; but in a later case (c) this ruling was not
followed, and it was held that, as an appeal was prac-
tically a rehearing ( d ), the complainant below should
begin, though it seems the judge has an absolute
discretion as to the order of hearing.
The production of the Warden’s decision, as re-
quired by the Act No. 291, sec. 213, was a condition
precedent to the hearing of an appeal, and could not
be waived ; it was not a mere right between the
parties, like a notice of appeal (e) ; but this section
has been amended by sec. 21 of the Act No. 446,
which repealed the proviso in sec. 213 of the Act No.
291 [see No. 1120, sec. 257]. However, before an
appeal can be heard a copy of the complaint before
the Warden, and a copy of the Warden’s decision,
which is appealed against, must be delivered to the
clerk of the court, or the court must be provided with
a copy (/). It need not be certified as a true copy,

as the section only requires the appellant to lodge
what he represents verbally or otherwise to be a copy
of the complaint; but the judge may receive evidence
as to its correctness ( g).
The court may make such order with respect to the
costs of the appeal and of the proceeding appealed
from as it may think fit (Act No. 291, sec. 213) [No.
1120, sec. 257]; but if the subject matter of appeal
shall appear to the court not to exceed in value twenty
pounds, no costs of the appeal will be allowed unless
the court shall under special circumstances allow
them (Act No. 291, sec. 215) [No. 1120, sec. 259].
The judge should hear an appeal without reference
to any negotiations for compromise between the par-
ties after the decision of the Warden is made (h) ; but
an agreement between the parties prior to the hearing
of the complaint to accept the decision of the Warden
as final will bar the appeal (sec. 214) [No. 1120, sec.

CHAPTER IV.
THE APPELLATE MINING COURT.
SECTION I.—THE COURT OF THE CHIEF JUDGE OF
COURTS OF MINES.
The right of appeal from the Court of Mines to the
Supreme Court was first given by The Goldfields Act
(No. 32), sec. 71, which Act created the first Court of
Mines. On the repeal of this Act by The Mining
Statute (No. 291) a new appellate court was erected,
entitled the Court of the Chief Judge of Courts of
Mines, to which court appeal might be had from the
Court of Mines (a) ; and by the same Act the Judge
of the Court of Mines was empowered to reserve any
question of law in the form of a special case for the
opinion of the Chief Judge (6), and a similar power
was given to the Warden (c).
The Court of the Chief Judge was a court of record,
on the same footing as the Supreme Court, and its
officers were the officers of the Supreme Court in its

equity jurisdiction, who performed all the duties
appertaining to the Court of the Chief Judge as were
analagous to the duties performed by them as officers
of the Supreme Court in its equity jurisdiction.
Ihe Court of the Chief Judge was, however, abol-
ished by The Judicature Act 1883 (d), and after the
coming into operation of that Act (July 1, 1884), the
jurisdiction therefore vested in the Court of the Chief
Judge was transferred to the Supreme Court, and,
except as to pending business, the Court of the Chief
Judge ceased to exist ( e ).
The creation of the Court of the Chief Judee did
not altogether deprive the Supreme Court of its
jurisdiction (/), and the transferred jurisdiction of
such court does not therefore interfere with the power
of the Supreme Court in its general jurisdiction.
SECTION lI.—APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF MINES.
The right of appeal to the Court of the Chief
Judge [Supreme Court] is given by sec. 172 of The
Mining Statute 1865 [No. 1120, sec. 210] which
provides for the procedure thereon. The Chief Judge
[Supreme Court] may hear the appeal and make such
order therein as shall be just, and may dismiss the
appeal, or reverse or vary the decree appealed from,
or may direct the case to be re-heard before the court,
but not before the Court of Mines, and may give

costs ; and the order of the Chief Judge [Supreme
Court] is final (a).
Where an appeal case had not been transmitted
within the time limited by sec. 172 of the Act No.
291 [No. 1120, sec. 210], yet was set down in the list
for hearing by the Chief Judge, it was held that an
objection on this ground should be made by moving
to have the case struck out of the list, otherwise the
appeal would be heard (6); and where an appeal case
was not transmitted within the proper time, and the
only order for enlargement appearing on the case was
one made by the judge of the Court of Mines after he
had removed from the district, no order was made on
the appeal (c).
The judge of the Court of Mines has the power to
rescind or vary his order enlarging the time for trans-
mission of the appeal case, and there is no appeal
from the exercise of his discretion ( d ). But where
the time for transmitting the appeal case had expired
on March 28, and the judge of the Court of Mines
enlarged the time to April 21, and on April 29, the
case not having then been transmitted, he, with the
consent of the attorneys for the parties, further en-
larged the time to May 11, it was held that, the
second enlargement having been granted eight days
after the expiration of the previous enlarged time,
the judge had no power to enlarge further, and the

appeal was gone (e). So, the power to direct a fur-
ther time for transmission of the appeal case must be
exercised before the original or extended time has
expired (/), and the consent of an attorney to the
extension will not bind his client after the cause is so
out of court ( g ).
The time within which an appeal from a decree of
the Court of Mines may be made should run from the
time when the decree was pronounced, and not from
the time when it was drawn up (h).
The Chief Judge [Supreme Court] on appeal may
decide whether some of the defendants below served
with notice of the appeal sufficiently represent all the
defendants, and may review the decision of the judge
of the Court of Mines in the matter ( i ).
Objections to appeals must be dealt with by the
appellate court, and not by the primary judge (j),
and an objection which should have been taken in the
Court of Mines cannot be entertained on appeal to
the Chief Judge [Supreme Court], if such objection
was not taken in the court below (k).
An appeal from the Court of Mines is practically a
rehearing (I); it opens up the whole case, and the
appellate court may increase the amount of damages
awarded by the court below (m).

On appeal to the Chief Judge [Supreme Court]
from the Court of Mines it is the duty of the judge
of the latter court to state the case fully, having
reference to the particular points raised before him,
and he ought to seek the assistance of both parties to
secure the insertion of such facts as they consider
material. The Chief Judge [Supreme Court] will not
travel out of the case to go into evidence which the
case omitted to set out, and the Chief Judge [Supreme
Court] will not order a rehearing before him or the
court when the evidence is set out sufficiently clearly
to leave no doubt as to what the facts really are.
But the Chief Judge [Supreme Court] will grant a
rehearing when the facts material to the decree do
O
not appear to have been made the subject of evidence,
or where the evidence was set out in extenso, and no
conclusion could be arrived at from that evidence ( n ).
The judge’s notes of evidence are only to be taken
with reference to the arguments urged before him,
and made the ground of appeal; the parties are not
allowed to object that such notes did not show evi-
dence of something as to which objection was not
taken (o).
The Chief Judge [Supreme Court] cannot control
the judge of the Court of Mines, and if he refuses to
introduce evidence into the case the Chief Judge
[Supreme Court] has no power to deal with it. The
Chief Judge refused to allow a case to be supple-
mented by affidavit that evidence not shown in the
appeal case was given at the hearing, and he refused
to remit the case to be restated when the judge of the

No appeal lies to the Chief Judge [Supreme Court]
from an order of the judge of the Court of Mines
setting aside his former decree, and directing a new
trial ( q ) ; but appeal will lie from an order dismissing
a summons for commitment under the Act No. 291,
sec. 155 [No. 1120, sec. 192] (r).
The Chief Judge [Supreme Court] may make such
order with reference to costs as may be considered
just and proper (s), and can give costs where there is
no jurisdiction to hear the appeal ( t ).
The order of the Chief Judge [Supreme Court] on
appeal is final, and is deemed to be a final order of the
Supreme Court within the meaning of any Orders in
Council in force relating to appeals from that court
(Act No. 291, s. 173) [No. 1120, sec. 211],
SECTION lII.—SPECIAL CASE.
The object of a special case is to determine ques-
tions of law. It is not an appeal. The office of a
special case is to state the facts, and ask the opinion
of the Chief Judge [Supreme Court] as to the law
only; and not to substitute the Chief Judge [Supreme
Court] for a judge or Warden to decide facts upon the
balance of evidence (a), and where a special case em-

braced questions of fact as set out in the evidence the
Chief Judge refused to answer it (b).
The points in difference must be succinctly stated
(c) and the whole of the case must be stated, and a
definite question or questions asked for the opinion of
the appellate court. It is not sufficient to ask if the
judge below or the Warden were right in deciding as
he did, or in nonsuiting. “ This way of asking the
propriety of a nonsuit, and not showing in some
degree what is the supposed defect in the plaintiff’s
case according to the judge’s view is inconvenient”
(d) So, asking for the opinion of the court on a
motion for prohibition is inconvenient, if not improper
(e) Neither should a case be stated until all evidence
has been taken on both sides (/).
The Chief Judge [Supreme Court] will not answer
anything he is not asked, even if it appears on the
face of the proceedings ( g ), and the Supreme Court
cannot vary a case put before it; it has nothing to do
but to answer the case as it stands (A), nor will it
listen to an objection not raised in the court below.
“ I have simply to answer the questions put me by
the district judge, and it is for him to decide how he
will deal with the case after I have given my opinion”
(i). So, the Supreme Court will not on the hearing
of a special case receive affidavits filed after the

special case has been stated, but will answer the case
as it stands ( j ); and the Chief Judge refused to allow
a case to be supplemented by an affidavit that evi-
dence not shown by the case was given at the hear-
ing (k).
A special case cannot be s ( tated on a question not
raised on the original hearing (I), and questions
depending upon results of conversation between the
judge or Warden and counsel are not proper subjects
for a special case (m). But where the point raised
was not a proper one for a special case, as it did not
arise on the hearing of any suit or appeal, according
to sec. 171 of the Act No. 291 [No. 1120, sec. 209],
but as there was no protest against it, the Chief Judge
stated that he would answer the question, not mean-
ing, however, that the judge below should be bound
by the answer (n) ; and where on a special case stated
by the Warden the party who applied for the case to
be stated did not appear on the hearing of the case,
the Chief Judge heard the case, and answered the
questions (o); and where there was no appearance of
either party before the Chief Judge, he directed a
written opinion to be forwarded to the Warden (p).
But a motion for the rehearing of a special case was
refused on non-appearance of the party applying for
the case ( q ).

The opinion of the Supreme Court on a special case
stated is not a decree of the Court of Mines, or a
decision of the Warden. It has been decided by the
Privy Council that upon a question submitted the
case remains open for adjudication by the original
court, notwithstanding the opinion of the Chief Judge

(a) Stated by the Judge of the Court of Mines.
The judge of the Court of Mines may at the hear-
ing or rehearing of any suit or appeal (s), or at the
trial of any issue, reserve any question in the form of
a special case for the opinion of the Chief Judge
[Supreme Court] (t), but it is necessary before the
judge of the Court of Mines can intervene between
the parties and state a special case that it appear on
the case that the parties could not agree (u).
The opinion of the Chief Judge [Supreme Court]
on a special case from the Court of Mines is not a
decree of the latter court; an order must be drawn
up in accordance with the opinion, and the decree of
the judge of the Court of Mines made in pursuance
thereof 0). The order so drawn up should be acted
on as a decree of the Court of Mines, and the judge
can exercise no discretion as to the propriety of the
decree, but must regard his- duties as simply minis-
terial in this respect (w).

The points in difference should be succinctly stated.
Thus, where a special case from the judge of the
Court of Mines, after setting out the whole of the
evidence for the plaintiffs, concluded by asking
whether the plaintiffs had established a case, it was
sent back to be re-stated in order to show the non-
suit points relied on ( x ).
Objections to the hearing of an appeal to the Court
of Mines from the decision of the Warden, as to ser-
vice of notice of appeal, and preliminary objections
to the hearing of a suit as to the service of summons,
may be the subject of a special case {y\ but not
questions of fact {z) ; and where the judge of the
Court of Mines dismissed an appeal, and afterwards
one of the appellants applied to have his name struck
out, and all proceedings set aside as against him, it
was held that this was not a proper point for a special
case (a).
And if the judge of the Court of Mines decides
a case on a point of law not raised during the trial
the judge cannot be compelled to state a special case
to the Chief Judge [Supreme Court] as to a question
of law which did not arise at the hearing. Proceed-
J ngs should be take to set the judgment aside ( b ).
But where a defendant in the Court of Mines on an
appeal from the decision of the Warden asked for a
special case at the close of the evidence for the
plaintiff, without stating that he desired to call
evidence, he was bound by the decision on the special

and call evidence in his behalf (c).
Where, however, on a special case from the Court
of Mines on appeal from the Warden several questions
are put to the Chief Judge [Supreme Court], one of
which questions is not at the time material, and is
not answered, such question may be asked again in
another special case after a further hearing in the
court below, and the judge will be ordered to state
such case ( d ).
Under sec. 172 of the Act No. 291 [No. 1120, sec.
210] the judge of the court means the judge for the
time being, who is the proper person to state a

On the hearing of a special case from the Court of

special case for the opinion of the Chief Judge
[Supreme Court] ( h ).
The question of admissibility of evidence in a com-
plaint before the Warden is a proper subject for a
special case ( i ), but the Warden may not state a case
on questions which he should in his discretion deter-
mine himself, such as the preponderance of evi-
dence (j).
On a special case from the Warden the complainant
in the original proceedings has the right to begin ( k ).
After having received the bpinion given by the
Supreme Court, the Warden must make his order in
accordance with such opinion, and no appeal on any
question of law raised by the case will lie from the
Warden, or from the Warden and assessors, but such
decision will be binding and conclusive on all parties
(I) ; and an order made by the Warden after he has
refused to state a special case is, ultra vires (m).
Where a question on a special case has been an-
swered, and the case has been remitted to the Warden
for his opinion on facts, there is nothing to prevent
the Warden taking additional evidence on the ques-
tion which has been left to him ( n ). It is a matter

of judicial discretion for the Warden whether, after
an answer is given by the Chief Judge [Supreme
Court] -to a case stated by him, he should take fresh
evidence, or allow an amendment, and no appeal lies
from the exercise of such discretion (o). Thus, when
the Chief Judge [Supreme Court] has given an answer
to a question, viz., that miners’ rights should have
been produced, the appellant may then apply to the
Warden for a rehearing to produce further evidence
“ Virtually my answer was a decision only as far as
it went; all other points were left open. The Privy
Council has decided (p) that upon questions sub-
mitted by special case the case remains open for
adjudication by the original court, notwithstanding
my answer thereto ” (q).
The Supreme Court had no power to.grant costs on
a special case stated under the Act No. 32 (r), but
under the Act No. 4J6, sec. 25 [No. 1120, sec. 268] the
Chief Judge [Supreme Court] may upon the argument
of any special case make such order with respect to
costs as he may think proper (s).
Where the Warden refiises to state a case, and a
rule nisi is obtained and absolute, directing him
to do so, the Chief Judge' [Supreme Court] on a
special case will not give costs against the Warden
unless they are specially asked for in the rule nisi (i t).

Form of case.
Practice.
No definite form is provided of a special case from
the Warden or the Court of Mines for the opinion of
the Supreme Court. A case stated by the Warden
may be in the following form: —
In the Supreme Court,
In the matter of a complaint before the War-
den at S. between
A. B, complainant
and
C. D. defendant.
Special case stated by the Warden at S. for the opinion
of the Full Court.
This case was commenced by summons, by which the
complainant sought [copy complaint of summons ].
The said summons came on for hearing before me the
undersigned Warden [or Warden and assessors] at S. on
the day 189 , both parties being
represented by counsel, when it was proved [state concisely
and clearly the evidence given before the Warden , and the
points raised].
After hearing arguments I reserved for the opinion of
the Full Court the following questions of law ;
[set out severally the questions reserved].
A case stated by the judge of the Court of Mines
may be in a similar form, mutatis mutandis.
The case is drawn up by the attorney of the party
requiring the case to be stated, and if necessary is
settled by counsel, after which a draft is delivered to
the other side for approval ; and if the parties cannot
agree as to the form of the case it is settled by the
Warden. It is then engrossed and signed by the War-
den after which it is entered for argument with the
prothonotary, and notice of setting down is served,
with a copy of the case, on the other side.


A special case for the opinion of the Supreme
Court may be applied for by either party, and in such
case proceedings may be stayed on such terms as the
Warden may think lit until the opinion shall be given
(No. 446, sec. 22) [No. 1120, sec. 265]. If the Warden
refuse to state a case on such application he cannot
make an order until after the expiration of ten days
from the day of such refusal (No. 446, sec. 23) [No.
1120, sec. 266]; and the applicant may within such
ten days apply to the Supreme Court for a rule nisi
calling upon the Warden to show cause why he should
not state the case.

DIVISION I.—MINING MANAGEMENT.
(1) Miner's Right.
4. It shall be lawful for the Governor in Council to
cause documents to be issued, each of which shall be called
a “ Miner’s Right ” and which shall be in force for any
number of years not exceeding fifteen ; and any such docu-
ment shall be granted to any person applying for the same
upon payment of a sum at the rate of five shillings for
every year for which the same is to be in force.
It shall also be lawful for the Governor in Council to
cause other documents to be issued, each to be called a
“ Consolidated Miner’s Right ” and to be in force for any
number of years not exceeding fifteen ; and any such last-
mentioned document shall, on the application of the mana-
ger or any trustee or trustees of any company of persons
who shall have agreed to work in partnership any claim or
claims registered under the provisions hereof, be granted to
such manager trustee or trustees on behalf of the persons
who shall from time to time be members of such company ;
and shall during its continuance be held by the manager or
the trustee or trustees for the time being of such com-
pany on behalf of such last-mentioned persons ; and shall
be in lieu of and represent and be of the same force and
effect as a number of miners’ rights granted for the same
period of time equal to the number of miners’ rights by
virtue of which the said claim or claims shall have origin-
ally been taken possession of; and the same shall be
granted to any person aforesaid so applying on payment of
a sum at the rate aforesaid multiplied by the number of
miners’ rights which the same is to represent.
Every such document shall be dated of the day and at
the place of the issuing thereof, and shall state the num-
ber of years for which it is to be in force, and contain the
Christian name and surname and the residence of (in case
of a miner’s right) the person in whose favor the same shall
be issued, and (in case of a consolidated miner’s right) the
manager or trustee or trustees to whom and the name of
the company on whose behalf the same shall be issued.


Every such miner’s right shall he in the form in the first
part of the Second Schedule to this Act ; and every such
consolidated miner’s right shall be in the form in the
second part of the said schedule.
Provided that the term “ miner’s right ” where it occurs
throughout this Part of this Act shall, unless inconsistent
with the context, be taken to mean and include a con-
solidated miner’s right.
Provided also that when any such consolidated miner’s
right shall be granted, the miner’s rights of the persons in
whose behalf the same shall be granted shall be retained
by them, and such persons shall be respectively deemed

deliver such appointment and serve such copy, the other
party, if he shall not have failed to do so, may serve upon

ment shall be made.
25. The value so ascertained of any such building or
erection as aforesaid shall be added to the upset price of

become the purchaser of such land and shall pay for the
same, such holder shall be entitled to receive out of such
purchase money the said value of such building or erection.
26. The Board of Land and Works may grant licenses in ]

carrying out such decree :
(xn.) Generally concerning all questions and disputes
cognizable as aforesaid which may arise between
miners in relation to mining on Crown lands.
And the jurisdiction hereby given to Courts of Mines shall
extend not only to cases where the litigants shall be the
parties originally interested in the cause of suit, but to
cases where the title of any such litigants shall be derived
as assignee or otherwise from or through any of such
parties ; and in the exercise of its jurisdiction every court
of Mines may make such decree in the nature of an award
as may be just, and without regard to any rule of law
affecting the form only of relief or to the practice of any
court of law or of equity ; and may, where the same shall
be proper, decree the sale of any such land water gold or

property of any such partnership ; and for the purpose of
carrying out and enforcing such jurisdiction may exercise
all such powers and make all such orders as the Supreme


Court could exercise or make for the purpose of carrying
out and enforcing the analogous jurisdiction of that court;
and in every case where in any such suit it shall appear
that any party is entitled to the possession use or enjoyment
of any such land water gold or metals or minerals or share
or interest therein and generally in the exercise of its
jurisdiction, such court may, on the application of such
party or otherwise as shall be right, direct such process by
way of warrant in analogy to a writ of possession or resti-
tution or injunction to put into possession or to any other
process as used in the Supreme Court in addition to or in
substitution for the process provided for by this Part of
this Act as the judge in the particular case shall consider
necessary to the bailiff of the court \ who shall execute the
same accordingly, and who shall possess and be entitled to
exercise in the execution thereof, in addition to the powers
by this Part especially conferred upon him, all the powers
and authority of the sheriff when acting in execution of
the process of the Supreme Court.
136. If all the parties to any suit in any Court of Mines
shall, by writing under their hands or under the hands of
their respective attorneys or counsel or under the hands of
the manager of or the officer managing the company or of
so many of the parties as shall make it appear to the judge
that the parties so desire, require the judge of the court to
act as arbitrator in the matter of dispute, such judge may
so act and may make an award therein, which shall be in
the nature and have the effect of and be expressed as A
decree in the suit ; and such award shall not be subject
to question or appeal in any court whatever.
137. If in any suit or appeal in the Court of Mines both
legal and equitable rights are involved, the judge may ad-
judicate upon and determine in the same suit both classes
of rights, although a decision upon one class of rights only
may be sought by the plaint.
138. It shall be lawful for any assignee executor or ad-
ministrator to sue and be sued in any court holden under
this Part of this Act or before a warden, or to take pro-
ceedings by way of appeal or otherwise under this Part, in
like manner as if he were a party in his own right; and it
shall be lawful for any person under the age of twenty-one
years to sue or to be sued in any court holden under this
Part or before a warden or to take proceedings by way of

(c) Proceedings in the Courts of Mines.
139. Every suit in a Court of Mines shall be commenced
by a plaint in writing ; and may, with the leave of the
judge obtained on an ex parte application after the plaint
shall be sealed as hereinafter directed, be prosecuted with
written pleadings, but without such leave shall be prosecuted
without written pleadings ; and every such plaint shall state
in which of the said modes the suit is to be prosecuted, and
shall be entitled of the court in which the suit shall be
brought and of the day and year on which the summons in-
dorsed thereon as hereinafter required shall be sealed as
hereinafter directed.
140. Every plaint shall be in the form in the Ninth
Schedule to this Act, and shall state the names and last
known places of abode of the parties so far as the same shall
be known to the plaintiff, and set forth as briefly as shall
be consistent with clearness a statement of the facts upon
which the plaintiff shall rely, and (if he shall be so advised)
of his answer to any anticipated defence on the part of the
defendant; such statement to be divided into paragraphs
numbered consecutively, and each containing as nearly as
may be a distinct allegation ; and every such plaint shall
pray for the relief to which the plaintiff shall conceive him-
self entitled, and shall state the amount sought to be re-
covered so far as the demand shall be pecuniary.
141. The rules adopted in the Supreme Court permitting
in certain cases some persons to sue and be sued on behalf
of themselves and others shall in the like cases in the Courts
of Mines be adopted in those courts; and in such case the
form aforesaid shall be altered and adapted to that mode
of suit.
142. In case the plaintiff in any such suit shall consider
that for the purpose of making the statements in any such
plaint more clear it would be useful that one or more than
one map or plan sh6uld be annexed to the said plaint and
referred to thereby, such plaintiff may cause the same to be
so annexed and may refer thereto by such plaint, and the
same shall be taken as part of the said plaint; and in esti-
mating the costs of the suits a reasonble sum shall be al-


lowed for the expense of every such map or plan, unless the
judge shall consider that the same was unnecessary.
143. On every such plaint there shall be endorsed in
writing a summons directed to the defendant or defendants
by name or names, which summons shall state whether the
plaintiff or plaintiffs is or are proceeding in person or by
attorney ; and every such summons shall in the case of a
suit to be prosecuted without written pleadings be in the
form in the Tenth Schedule to this Act, and shall require
the defendant to appear in the Court of Mines at the place
where the summons shall be sealed as hereinafter directed,
and on the day on which the court shall first sit at that
place next after the expiration of fifteen days from the day
of the service of such summons, to answer the said plaint;
and every such summons shall in the case of a suit to be
prosecuted with written pleadings be in the form in the
Eleventh Schedule to this Act, and shall require the
defendant within such number of days after service on him
of such summons as shall be directed by any such general
rules as aforesaid to deliver an answer to the plaint of the
plaintiffs.
144. Every summons so indorsed shall be signed by the
clerk of the court for the place at which such suit is to be
heard, and shall be sealed by him with the seal of such court
and dated of the day of such sealing ; and the plaint upon
which the summons so sealed shall have been indorsed shall
be left with such clerk, who shall number the same accord-
ing to the order in each year in which the summons thereon
shall be sealed, and shall file the same in his office ; and
if any such map or plan as aforesaid shall be annexed to
such plaint, the same shall together with such plaint be left
with such clerk for the inspection of any defendant in such
suit who may require the same ; and every such map or
plan together with all other documents in the same suit
shall by the said clerk be filed and kept together with such
plaint in one and the same place and marked with the
name and number of the suit.
145. Upon every person whom it shall be intended to
make a defendant in any such suit there shall be served in
the manner and such service shall be proved in the mode
directed by any such general rules as aforesaid (unless in
cases where service shall be substituted by leave of the
court or the judge thereof), by the plaintiff himself or his
agent or the bailiff of the court, a copy of such plaint (but

of the summons indorsed on such plaint, every such last-

like manner as the original summons is hereinbefore
directed to be signed and sealed ; and no person shall,
unless it shall be otherwise ordered by the court, be
deemed a defendant in such suit unless and until he shall
be so served.
146. No misnomer or inaccurate description of any
person or place in any such plaint or summons shall vitiate
the same, so that the person or place be therein described
so as to be commonly known.
147. It shall be lawful for the defendant, in any suit for
or which shall include a pecuniary demand, within such
time as shall be directed by any such general rules as
aforesaid, to pay into court the amount of the sum claimed
in such suit as mentioned in the summons endorsed on the
plaint therein together with the costs incurred by the
plaintiff in respect of that sum up to the time of such
payment and of delivering the notice hereinafter mentioned.
Notice of such payment shall be communicated by the
clerk of the court or by the defendant and certified by the
clerk to the plaintiff by causing the same to be delivered at
his usual last-known place of abode or business; and the
said sum of money and costs shall be paid to the plaintiff;
and after such payment into court no other suit shall be
brought or prosecuted in any court in respect of the
demand in satisfaction of which such sum shall have been
so paid.
148. Any defendant in any suit for or which shall in-
clude a pecuniary demand may, within such time as shall
be directed by the general rules aforesaid, pay into court
such sum of money as he shall think a full satisfaction for
such demand together with the costs incurred by the
plaintiff in respect of that sum up to the time of such
payment and of delivering the notice next hereinafter
mentioned. Notice of such payment shall be communi-
cated by the clerk of the court to the plaintiff by causing
the same to be delivered at his usual or last known place
of abode or business; and the said sum of money and
costs shall be paid to the plaintiff; and if he shall elect to
proceed and shall recover no further sum in the suit in re-
spe«t of such pecuniary demand than shall have been so


paid into court, the plaintiff shall (unless the court or the
judge thereof shall otherwise order) pay to such defendant
the costs incurred by him in the said suit after such pay-
ment into court, and the court may decree the same
accordingly.
149. If any defendant to any suit to be prosecuted with
written pleadings shall consider that the same is defective
by reason of the absence of some party necessary thereto
either as plaintiff or defendant, he may within six days
after he shall have been served with the plaint therein
serve a notice in writing entitled in the suit and bearing
the number thereof upon the plaintiff, requiring him to
show cause on the day but two next after such service
before the court in which such suit shall be pending or the
judge thereof or on such other day as such court or judge
shall appoint why the person whose absence is complained
of should not be made a party to such suit; and such court
or judge shall have power to direct such person to be made
a party to such suit by amendment, and shall make such
order respecting the same and as to the time within which
any amendment which may be ordered is to be made and
any amended plaint served if such service shall be ordered
and within which a notice of objection as hereinafter men-
tioned or the answer to the plaint in such suit or both is or
are to be served or delivered without reference if the judge
shall so think fit to the regular time for such service or
delivery and as to the costs of such application and other-
wise as such court or judge shall see fit.
150. Within such number of days after a defendant in
a suit to be prosecuted with written pleadings shall have
been served with the plaint therein as shall be directed by
any such general rules as aforesaid, save where it shall be
otherwise ordered by the court or the judge thereof, he
shall be entitled, if he considers that he has ground there-
for, to serve a notice in writing dated of the day of such
service entitled in the suit and bearing the number thereof
upon the plaintiff, thereby objecting that the plaintiff by
his own showing is not entitled to the relief sought for by
his plaint or to some particular part thereof; and every
such notice shall set forth the grounds of objection and '
shall be in the form in the Twelfth Schedule of this A.ct.
151. Within the same number of days, save where
it shall be otherwise ordered by the court or the judge
thereof, such defendant may, and whether he shall have

served notice of any such objection or not, deliver to the
plaintiff an answer in writing to the said plaint dated of
the day of such delivery entitled in the suit and bearing
the number thereof ; and when any such answer shall be
delivered, the defendant shall thereby in separate para-
graphs numbered consecutively fully answer the state-
ments in such plaint denying admitting or qualifying them,
but with the right to decline answering any particular
statement on some ground applicable to that statement
alone and not to the entire plaint; and by such answer the
defendant shall also set forth the matters of fact or
grounds upon which he intends to rest his defence; and he
may thereby insist upon several distinct defences, and may
also thereby make a case for and claim any cross relief
which in connection with the matters stated by the plaint
he could have obtained by a proceeding instituted by him-
self ; and every such answer shall be in the form in or as
directed by the Thirteenth Schedule to this Act.
152. Every such notice of objection and answer shall
have endorsed thereon a statement of the place of abode
or business of the defendant or of each of the defendants
whose notice or answer it shall be, and the name and place
of business of his or their attorney if he or they shall act
by such.
153. As many of the defendants in any suit to be prose-
cuted with written pleadings as can conveniently and with-
out prejudice to their or any of their interests combine in
an answer shall do so ; and in estimating the costs of a
suit the judge shall consider how far the number of
answers which may have been delivered therein was reason-
ably necessary for the due defence of the defendants or
any of them ; and he shall not allow the costs of any
answer beyond such as he shall deem to have been so neces-
sary.
154. Either party to any suit or action depending in any
Court of Mines may call on the other party by notice to
admit any fact or document saving all just exceptions; and
every such notice and admission respectively may be
in the form contained in the Fourteenth and Fifteenth
Schedules to this Act or to the like effect; and in case of
refusal or neglect to admit, the costs of proving the fact or
documents shall be paid by the party so neglecting or re-
fusing, whatever the result of the case may be, unless at


the hearing trial or inquiry the judge shall certify that the
refusal to admit was reasonable ; and no costs of proving
any document shall be allowed unless such notice be given,
except in cases where the omission to give the notice is in
the opinion of the judge of the Court of Mines a saving of
expense.
155. An affidavit of the attorney solicitor or agent in the
cause or his clerk of the due signature of any admissions
made in pursuance of such notice and annexed to the affi-
davit shall be in all cases sufficient evidence of such ad-
missions; and an affidavit of the attorney solicitor or agent
in the cause or his clerk of the service of any notice to
produce in respect of which notice to admit shall have been
given and of the time when it was served with a copy of
such notice to produce annexed to such affidavit shall be
sufficient evidence of the service of the original of such
notice and of the time when it was served.
156. If any party to any suit shall complain that by
reason of any uncertainty obscurity or repugnance in the
plaint or in any answer in such suit he is unable to make
answer to such plaint or to understand any issue tendered
or intended to be tendered by such answer, or that any
plaint or answer is so framed as to prejudice embarrass or
delay the fair hearing of the suit, he may within four days
after the service upon him of such plaint or the delivery to
him of such answer serve a notice in writing entitled in the
suit and bearing the number thereof upon the opposite
party, requiring him to show cause on the day but two next
after the service of such notice before the court in which
such suit shall be pending or the judge thereof or on such
other day as such court or judge shall appoint why the
plaint or answer should not be amended in respect of the
matter complained of ; and such court or judge shall have
power to direct any such amendment to be made, and shall
make such order respecting the same and as to the time
within which any amendment which may be ordered is to
be made and any amended plaint served if service thereof
shall be ordered and within which a notice of objection or
the answer or any amended answer to the plaint in such
suit or both such notice and answer is or are to be served
or delivered without reference if the judge shall think fit to
the regular time for such service or delivery and as to the
costs of such application and otherwise as such court or
judge shall see fit; and no party shall be permitted to appeal
from any such order.

157. Upon the expiration of the time limited either as
aforesaid or by any special order of the court or the judge
thereof for the delivery of the answer of any of the defen-
dants in the case of a suit to be prosecuted with written
pleadings, the suit shall be deemed to be at issue between
the plaintiff and such defendant; and after the suit shall
be at issue as to all the defendants, the plaintiff shall, in
the manner to be directed by such general rules as afore-
said, enter the same to be heard on the first day of that
sitting of the court which shall occur next after the expir-
ation of twenty-one days from the time when the suit shall
be at issue as last mentioned
158. After any such last-mentioned suit shall have been
so entered the plaintiff shall, not less than ten days before
the day for which it shall be entered for hearing, serve in
the manner and such service shall be proved in the mode
directed by any such general rules as aforesaid (unless in
cases where service shall be substituted or any shorter time
limited by leave of the court) a notice upon the defendant
or each of the defendants if more than one, informing him
of the day and place upon and at which such hearing is to
be had.
159. Within seven days immediately preceding the day
for which the hearing shall be so entered, the plaintiff shall
make and lodge with the clerk of the court an engrossment
on paper bookwise of the plaint and of each notice of objec-
tion and answer which shall have been delivered (if any)
with any amendments made in any of them and entitled in
and bearing the number of the suit; and any defendant
who before the commencement of the said period of seven
days shall pay to the plaintiff his demand and costs, or
submit by a notice to be served on the plaintiff to a decree
for all that shall be required by the plaint with costs, shall
not be bound to pay the costs of such engrossment.
160. In the case of a suit to be prosecuted without
written pleadings, the plaintiff shall at the time and place
named in that behalf in any such summons as aforesaid
appear; the defendants shall thereupon be required to
appear to answer such suit; and on answer being made in
court by the defendants or by such of them as shall in the
opinion of the court sufficiently represent the defendants,
such court shall proceed to hear the suit in a summary way ;
and upon the hearing of any such suit any defendant may
obtain any cross relief which in connection with the matters


stated by the plaint he could have obtained by a proceed-
ing instituted by himself,
161. In the case of a suit to be prosecuted with written
pleadings the clerk of the court shall on the day for which
the hearing of the suit shall be so entered as aforesaid have
in court the said engrossment and all other documents in
the said suit; and if the plaintiff and the defendants or
such of them as shall in the opinion of the court sufficiently
represent the defendants shall appear, the court shall, if no
notice of any objection to the relief sought in the suit shall
have been served, proceed to hear such suit; but if any
such notice shall have been served, then the court shall
(unless it shall otherwise think proper) proceed first to bear
the objections taken by each notice so served and make its
decree against any defendant whose objections shall be over-
ruled and who shall not have delivered an answer, and then
proceed to hear the suit as against the other defendants,
except any as against whom the court shall be of opinion
that by reason of the allowance of any objections the suit
should not proceed ; but if any such objection shall be
allowed and notwithstanding such allowance the court shall
be of opinion that the plaintiff would be entitled to some
relief legal or equitable whether asked for by the plaint or
not on proof of the case made by the plaint if amended in
some manner not causing such case when so amended to
differ substantially from the same as originally put forward
the court shall on the application of the plaintiff, if it shall
deem that no injustice would be thereby done to any of the
parties, order such amendment to be made forthwith, and
the defendant whose objection shall have been so allowed
forthwith to answer ore terms the plaint so amended; and
forthwith proceed to hear the suit, save as to any defendant
against whom a decree shall have been made as aforesaid ;
but if it shall deem that such injustice would be done, the
court shall adjourn the hearing to such time and to such place
within its district as it shall think tit and upon the terms
hereinafter in cases of adjournment provided ; but if the
court shall be of opinion that by no such amendment would
the plaintiff be entitled to any relief as against the defen-
dant whose objections shall have been so allowed, then it
shall dismiss the suit as against such defendant and any
other defendant as against whom it ought in that case in
the opinion of the court to be dismissed, and shall make
such order as to costs as shall be right. Provided that it
shall not be competent to any defendant who shall neither
have delivered an answer nor have served any notice of

objections to make a case for himself on any such hearing
hut such defendant shall only be permitted to controvert
the case of the plaintiff; and the plaintiff in any such case
shall, on proving his case if in the opinion of the court good
in point of law, be entitled to a decree as against such
defendant.
162. Any defendant whether or not notice of any such
objection shall have been served by him, shall be at liberty
to take at the hearing ore tenus any or any other objection
which might be taken by any such notice ; and the Court
shall proceed to hear and to deal with and in respect of
such objection as if notice thereof had been served. Pro-
vided however that any such objection ore tenus shall be
taken before the hearing of the suit shall be entered upon.
Provided also that in no case shall the court, whether any
such objection shall be taken by notice or ore tenus or not,
make a decree for a plaintiff on a plaint which or which if
amended as aforesaid shall show no right to such decree;
and in all cases of objections the court shall have power to
deal with the costs thereof and of the argument thereof as
it shall think just.
163. If it shall appear at the hearing that the case
designed to be made by any answer is by reason of the
omission or the erroneous uncertain or incongruous state-
ment of some fact ineffectual and the court shall have no
ground to believe that such error could not be rectified
consistently with truth, such court may, if it shall deem
that no injustice would be thereby done to the parties and
shall see no other objection thereto, order such error to be
forthwith rectified and the hearing forthwith to proceed ;
or if it shall deem that such injustice would be done or
shall see any such other objection, may adjourn the hearing
to such time and to such place within its district as it shall
think fit and upon the terms hereinafter in cases of adjourn-
ment provided for,
164. Whenever a defendant shall have objected to
answer any particular statement in a plaint on some ground
applicable to that statement alone, the question as to the
validity of such objection shall be decided by the court on
the examination of the defendant as a witness in reference
to the matter of such statement; and when a defendant
shall have altogether omitted to answer a statement in a
plaint without alleging any reason for such omission or
shall have answered the same evasively, he shall be taken


to have admitted the same, unless the court shall consider
that such course would be unjust; in which event the
court may, if it shall think fit, deal with the case as
if within the next preceding section thereof.
165. If on the hearing of a suit prosecuted with written
pleadings it shall appear that any defendant is entitled to
any cross relief, the court may grant the same if a case
therefor shall have been made by the answer of such
defendant; but if such case shall not have been made, the
court may, if it shall deem that no injustice would be
thereby done to the plaintiff, order the answer to be forth-
with amended in such manner as to make such case, and
may grant such relief; but if it shall deem that any
injustice would be done, it may adjourn the hearing to such
time and place within its district as it shall think fit and
upon the terms hereinafter in cases of adjournment pro-
vided for.
166. Misjoinder of plaintiffs or of defendants shall not
be allowed' to form a ground of objection in any such
notice of objections as aforesaid, and no suit shall be dis-
missed on the ground of any such misjoinder ; but if the
court at the hearing or rehearing of the suit shall deem
that no injustice would be thereby done to any of the par-
ties, it shall in the case of misjoinder of a plaintiff forth-
with order all such amendments as shall be necessary to
rectify such misjoinder to be made in the plaint, either by
striking out the name of any of the plaintiffs or (if
justice shall so require) by changing any plaintiff into a
defendant and by adding to the plaint such averments _as
shall thereupon become necessary \ and in the case of mis-
joinder of a defendant it shall dismiss the suit as against
such defendant, or (if justice shah so require) shall order
such defendant to be made a plaintiff and all aveiments
becoming necessary thereupon to be added to the plaint by
amendment thereof; and forthwith in either case proceed
to hear the suit; but if the court shall deem that such
iniustice would be done, it shall adjourn the hearing to
such time and to such place within its district as it shall
think fit and upon the terms hereinafter in cases of
adjournment provided for.
167. If at or in the course of the hearing or rehearing of
any suit it shall appear that any person interested in the
subject-matter of the suit and who ought to be a party
thereto either as plaintiff or defendant is not such party or

in the case of a defendant has not been duly served wit
the summons or notice of the hearing or does not appea
(his absence not being sufficiently excused) the court ma
either proceed to the hearing of the suit in the absence o
such person and make a decree either binding or savin
the rights of such person or adjourn the hearing in orde
that such person may if a defendant be served with th
summons or notice of hearing or if not a party, made sue
party either as plaintiff or defendant as the case may be
and if made a defendant served with such summons o
notice on such terms (if any) as to payment of costs by
the plaintiff to any defendant who shall have appeared a
such court shall think fit, or may dismiss the suit withou
prejudice to the right of the plaintiff to commence a fresh
suit tor the same cause. Provided that whenever the cour
shall make a decree in the absence of any such persoi
binding the rights of such person, it shall be lawful for the
judge in his discretion at the same or any subsequent cour
to set aside such decree or any part thereof and to grant
rehearing of the suit upon such terms (if any) as to pay
ment of costs giving security or otherwise as such court
may think fit on sufficient cause shown for that purpose.
168. No suit in any court shall be dismissed without the
consent of the plaintiff by reason only that the plaintiff
shall appear at the healing to be entitled to different reliei
from that which shall be sought by any plaint; but in
every such case and whenever it shall appear at the hearing
that the plaintiff is entitled to other relief than that sought
by the plaint, such court shall cause the plaint to°be
amended and the hearing forthwith to proceed; but in case
it shall appear to such court that the defendants or some of
them were in fact deceived by such plaint and that inius-
tice would be done by proceeding at once in such suit, it
shall be lawful for such court to adjourn such hearing to
such time and place within its district as it shall think fit
and upon the terms hereinafter in cases of adjournment
provided for; and whenever at the hearing of any such
suit any variance shall appear between the proof and any
statement in the plaint or in any answer which may have
been delivered in any particular or particulars in the judg-
ment of the court not material to the merits of the case, then,
if the opposite party could not have been prejudiced thereby
in the conduct of his suit or defence, such court may (if it
shall see fit so to do) cause such plaint or answer to be
forthwith amended and the hearing forthwith to proceed ;
but if the opposite party may have been prejudiced by such


variance, such court shall have power to adjourn the hear-
ing to such time and place within its district as it shall
think fit and upon the terms hereinafter in cases of adjourn-
ment provided for ; and after any amendment made in
respect of any such variance the hearing shall proceed either
at the time at which the said variance shall have appeared
or to which the hearing shall have adjourned in the same
manner in all respects both in respect to the liability qf
witnesses to be indicted for perjury and otherwise as if no
such variance had appeared.
169. In no case shall any mere informality in the plead-
ings or proceedings, or any omission not prejudicial or
embarrassing to any of the parties of any name or date or
other such matter in the title of the pleadings or otherwise,
prejudice any such suit or the defence thereto ; but the
same if in the pleadings shall be amended forthwith in
manner aforesaid.
170. Whenever in any of the cases aforesaid or in any
case in which the court shall think right so to do the court
shall adjourn the hearing of a case, it shall have power to
adjourn the same upon such terms as to allowing the plaint
or answer or both to be amended, and (where proper) an
answer or further answer to be delivered, and as to fixing
the time for and manner of delivering such amended plaint
or answer or further answer, or as to allowing some subse-
quent application to be made for liberty so to amend or
deliver such answer or further answer, and as to the pay-
ment of costs and otherwise as to such court shall seem fit.
And whenever any such subsequent application shall be
made, the court shall have power to grant the same upon
such terms as to costs and otherwise as it shall think just.
171. The plaintiff in any suit to be prosecuted with
written pleadings shall be at liberty at any time before an
answer shall have been delivered to his plaint to amend
such plaint as he shall be advised, subject however to the
provisions of such general rules as aforesaid ; but after any
such answer shall have been delivered, no plaintiff shall
amend his plaint without the leave of the court or the judge
thereof, and no defendant in any such suit shall be at
liberty to amend his answer without such leave ; and in
each of such cases such court or judge shall have power on
such terms as to payment of costs or otherwise as it shall
think right to grant such leave, and that whether or not
the suit shall be at issue as to any or all of the defendants;

and the course to be pursued to obtain and after having
obtained the same and the times within which any subse-
quent step in the suit is to be taken shall be that pointed
out for the purpose in the said general rules.
172. It shall be lawful for the court, if and whenever it
shall think fit so to do, to direct and issue to be tried at
such time as it shall appoint before such court and by six
assessors to be summoned as hereinafter directed ; and either
of the parties to any suit may require that any question of
fact material to the issue between the parties shall be tried
at the hearing by six assessors to be summoned as herein-
after mentioned ; the verdict of a majority of whom shall
in both cases be received ; and whenever any question of
fact shall be tried on the requisition of any of the parties
the judge in pronouncing his decree in the suit shall act
upon the verdict found on such trial : but whenever an
issue shall be tried on the direction of the judge, the judge
in pronouncing such decree shall act or not on the verdict
found on such trial as he shall think right, and shall have
power before pronouncing such decree to direct any other
trial or trials of such issue. Provided always that no party
to any suit shall be entitled so to require, unless he shall
eleven clear days before the day on which the suit is to
be heard give notice to the clerk of the court that he
requires assessors to be summoned for such hearing and six
clear days before such day serve on the opposite party or
(if more thaif one) on such of them as the court shall con-
sider sufficient to represent them or on his or their attorney
a notice stating that he has given to the said clerk such
notice. Provided also that the party so requiring shall at
the time when he shall so require pay into court the sum of
six pounds twelve shillings for assessors, any part whereof
not required for the payment of assessors shall be returned
to the plaintiff, and the residue thereof shall eventually be
paid as part of the costs of the suit by such of the parties
as the court shall in that behalf direct.
173. In any case of a trial by assessors no pleading
further than as aforesaid shall be necessary ; but in the
case of an issue directed by the judge, he himself shall
settle the same ; and in the case of facts to be tried on such
requisition of either of the parties, the parties shall, if they
cannot themselves agree thereon, settle under the direction
of the judge in the form of an issue the question respecting
the fact or each of the facts so to be tried, such settlement
to be made at any time before the trial of such question on


an application to the judge either in court or in chamber
upon notice served by the party requiring such trial upon
the other party ; and upon the day appointed for such trial
the parties shall appear, and the clerk of the court shall
then read the issue or question to be tried and the party
asserting the affirmative shall unless the court shall have
otherwise directed be entitled to begin. Every such trial
shall be proceeded on in the same manner as in the case of
the trial of an issue directed by the Supreme Court.
174. Whenever the court shall direct that an issue or
either of the parties to any such suit shall require that any
question of fact shall be tried by assessors, the clerk of the
court shall, in the former case on the direction of the court
and in the latter case on receiving notice of such requisition,
issue to the sheriff within whose bailiwick the place where
such issue or question is to be tried shall be, a precept for
assessors in the form as near as may be of a jury precept as
directed by any Act now or hereafter to be in force relating
to juries, thereby requiring the return of special jurors as
assessors.
And thereupon the said sheriff and clerk shall do all such
things for the procuring of assessors to try such issue or
question as by any Act now or hereafter to be in force are
or shall be directed to be done by any sheriff or the proper
officer of any court in which an issue in a civil action is to
be tried for the procuring of jurors to try such issue.
The swearing or taking the solemn affirmation and
declaration instead of being sworn of every such assessor
and of every other assessor provided for by this section
shall be regulated by the provisions of any Act now or
hereafter to be in force in respect to the swearing and
taking the solemn affirmation and declaration of jurors for
the trial of civil actions.
Any person summoned as such assessor who without law-
ful excuse shall neglect or refuse to attend or to be sworn
or serve as such assessor shall be fined such sum of money
as the judge shall think fit not exceeding Five pounds.
Provided always that no person shall be summoned or
compelled to serve as such assessor more than twice in one
year ; and every person so attending as an assessor who
shall be summoned to try an issue or fact shall be paid by
the clerk of the court ten shillings for each day that he
shall so attend and one shilling for every mile beyond three
miles that he shall travel to attend such court.

Provided further that if a sufficient number of the per-
sons summoned to act as assessors in any court to be holden
under this Act shall not attend or shall not remain after
any of them shall be challenged and set aside, it shall be
lawful for the clerk of such court as often as need be either
to nominate and appoint any one or more of the bystanders
or to summon a sufficient number of persons from the
neighborhood to act as assessor or assessors until the num-
ber of assessors required shall be obtained ; and any of the
bystanders so nominated or of the persons so summoned
and acting as assessor shall be entitled to receive the same
sum for such attendance as if he had been originally sum-
moned to attend, and any of the parties shall have the
same right of challenge with respect to such bystanders
and persons as he would have had with respect to the per-
son originally summoned.
175. If notice shall be given by either of the parties
that he has required assessors to the other of such parties
but by reason that no notice thereof has been given to the
said clerk no assessors shall have been summoned, the
party to whom such notice shall have been given may, if he
shall not consent that the suit shall proceed without asses-
sors, require that any of the bystanders or persons from
the neighborhood shall be appointed or summoned by the
said clerk to act as assessors ; and in such event the case
shall be deemed to be a case within the provision of the
latter part of the next preceding section hereof, and the
said clerk shall act accordingly ; and if in such case a suffi-
cient number of assessors cannot be obtained, or if the
party to whom such notice shall have been given shall not
choose to require that assessors should be so appointed or
summoned as aforesaid, he shall be entitled to require that
the hearing of the suit be adjourned, and that the said
clerk shall summon assessors for such adjourned hearing ;
and thereupon the court shall order such adjournment and
to such time and place and upon such terms as to payment
of costs or otherwise as such court shall direct; and asses-
sors shall be summoned for such adjourned hearing ; and
the provisions herein contained respecting assessors shall be
applicable so far as may be to assessors summoned as last
aforesaid.
176. It shall be lawful for any Court of Mines in such
way as the said court may think fit to obtain the assistance
of accountants engineers surveyors or other scientific per-
sons, or to direct any surveys maps or plans to be made the


better to enable such court to determine any matter at
issue in any suit or appeal, and to refer any question
requiring such assistance to any such person or persons,
and to act to such extent as it shall think fit upon his or
their certificate \ and the expense of obtaining any such
assistance or of such surveys maps or plans shall be deemed
to be part of the costs of the hearing.
177. If the plaintiff in any suit shall fail to appear at
the time and place at which the same is to be heard or to
which the hearing thereof shall have been adjourned, such
suit shall (unless the court shall otherwise order) be dis-
missed with costs as to any defendant who shall appear
and apply for such dismissal, without prejudice however to
any future suit for the same purpose; and as to any
defendant who shall not so appear and apply, the suit shall
(unless the court shall otherwise order) be struck out of the
list of causes for hearing and shall not be re-entered with-
out the order of the court.
178. If the defendant or, where more than one, the
defendants or a number of them not sufficient in the
opinion of the court to represent the defendants shall fail
to appear at the time and place at which the same is to be
heard or to which the hearing thereof shall have been
adjourned, and his or their absence shall not be sufficiently
excused, but the plaintiff shall so appear, the court in the
case may, upon due proof of the service of the summons
or notice of hearing according as the suit shall be prose-
cuted without or with written pleadings upon the defend-
ants or such of them as shall in the opinion of the court
sufficiently represent all the defendants not appear, proceed
to the hearing of the suit in the absence of the defendants
or such of them as shall be absent; and the decree there-
upon shall be as valid as if all the defendants had appeared.
Provided always that such court may in any such case at
the same or any subsequent sittings of the court set aside
any decree so given in the absence of any defendant, and
may grant a rehearing of the suit upon such terms (if any)
as to payment of costs giving security or otherwise as such
court may think fit, on sufficient cause shown for that pur-
pose, But if there shall be no such proof of service of the
summons or notice of hearing, then the suit shall, unless
the court shall think fit to act under the provision afore-
said for proceeding with the hearing in the absence of a
party, be struck out of the list of causes for hearing and
shall not be re-entered without the order of the court.

shall omit to take any step to be taken by him in such suit
at the time at which the same ought to be taken, the
defendant shall be entitled to apply to such court for an
order that such suit be dismissed for want of prosecution ;
and in case any application on notice to any such court or
to any judge thereof shall not be brought on at the time at
which it ought to be brought on the party against whom
such application was to have been made shall be entitled
to apply to such court for an order that the notice of such
application be discharged with costs ; and in each of the
said cases such court shall make such order therein and as
to the cost thereof and of such suit or notice of application
as it shall think just,
180. The judge of any Court of Mines may, in any case
where a court of equity might so do, make orders for staying
proceedings until security shall be given for costs, and may
also make orders for granting time to the plaintiff or defen-
dant to proceed in the prosecution or defence of the suit or
of any such appeal to the Court of Mines as is hereinafter
provided for; and any such judge may also from time to
time adjourn any sitting of the court, or may from time to
time adjourn or change the place for the hearing further
hearing or rehearing of any suit or of any such appeal or
the trial or new trial as hereinafter permitted of any issue
or question of fact in such manner and on such terms (if
any) as to payment of costs or otherwise as to such judge
may seem fit.
181. As soon after any decree shall have been pronounced
as it can conveniently be done, if the person in whose favour
the decree is made shall so desire, the clerk of the court
shall draw up the same entitled in the suit and bearing the
number thereof ; provided that any of the parties objecting
to the terms thereof as so drawn up may apply to the judge
to settle the same ; and when the same shall have been
drawn up or if settled by the judge when settled, it shall
be signed by the judge of the court; and thereupon it shall
become effective and enforceable by the process of the court
unless stayed by the court or unless appealed against or un-
less the court give time for the performance thereof; and
such decree in the case of a suit prosecuted without written
pleadings the clerk shall file in his office, and the same shall
become the record of such decree ; and in the case of a suit
prosecuted with written pleadings the clerk shall annex the
decree to the engrossment to be lodged with him as aforesaid
of the proceedings in the suit in which such decree shall have


been pronounced ; and such engrossment with such decree
so annexed shall be filed in his office by such clerk, and shall
thereupon become the record of such suit and decree; and a
document purporting to be a copy of any such decree or
engrossment or of any such engrossment with any such
decree so annexed or of any part thereof, and purporting
to bear the seal of the court and to be signed and certified
as a true copy by the clerk of the court which shall by
such document be stated to have pronounced the decree or
of the court in which the suit a copy of the engrossment of
the proceedings in which or of any part of which engross-
ment the said document shall purport to be shall by such
document be stated to be or to have been pending, shall be
admitted in all courts and places whatsoever as primd facie
evidence that such decree was pronounced, and that an
original of every plaint summons answer or notice of objec-
tion or other proceeding a copy of which is purported to be
set forth in the said document was served or delivered and
made use of in such suit as the same ought to have been
served delivered or made use of in order to make good the
said suit, and of the regularity of such decree and engross-
ment without any further proof.
182. It shall be lawful for a judge of a Court of Mines
within six weeks after his resignation of office, and for a
deputy judge within six weeks after the determination of
his appointment, to give in to the clerk of the said court a
written judgment in any action suit or other proceedings
heard before the said court judge or deputy judge, and such
clerk shall publicly read such written judgment at the next
sitting of such court, and a judgment decree or order shall
be entered or drawn up in pursuance of such judgment;
and every such judgment decree or order and every judg-
ment decree or order which has been so heretofore entered
or drawn up, shall have the same force and effect as if the
judgment in pursuance whereof it shall be or has been
entered or drawn up had been given by such judge or
deputy judge in open court on the day before his resigna-
tion or the determination of his appointment, save that all
times that run from the giving of judgment shall run from
the reading thereof by the clerk. This section shall be
deemed to have been in force on and since the first day of
March One Thousand eight hundred and seventy-two.

for ; but whenever such court shall decree or order the pay-
ment of money and the same shall not be paid into court or
otherwise as the court shall have directed either forthwith
or within the time limited for that purpose, it shall be law-
ful for the clerk of the court at the place at which such
decree or order shall have been made, upon the request of
the person entitled under such decree or order and without

to this Act.
The bailiff of the said court shall execute the said warrant
in any part of Victoria, and all constables and other peace
officers within their several jurisdictions shall aid and assist
in the execution of every such warrant; and every bailiff
or officer executing any such warrant as last aforesaid may
by virtue thereof seize and take any of the lands tenements

in or towards payment of the sum in respect of which such
warrant shall have issued ; and may also seize and take any
money or bank notes and any cheques bills of exchange
promissory notes bonds specialties or securities for money

or raised for the benefit of the person entitled as aforesaid
who may sue in the name of the party against whom any
such warrant shall have issued or in the name of any person
in whose name such party might have sued for the recovery of
the sum or sums secured or made payable thereby when the
time of payment thereof shall have arrived.
Provided that the expression “ lands tenements and

Schedule shall comprise and include an equity of redemption
and also all interest to which the person against whom such
warrant shall have issued is entitled at law or in equity in any
houses lands or other hereditaments corporeal or incorporeal
and real estates in Victoria and which he might according
to the laws of Victoria have disposed of by virtue of any
power or otherwise for his own benefit, and also any land
or building or share or interest at law or in equity therein
occupied or held by such person by virtue of any miner’s right
or business licence; and all powers vested in any such
person which such person might legally execute for his own
benefit shall be and are hereby by virtue of such warrant
vested in the said bailiff to be by him executed for the
benefit of the party suing out such warrant.
Provided always that no lands tenements and heredita-
ments shall be sold under any such warrant until one month
next after notice of time and place of such sale shall have
been published in the Government Gazette and in some news-
paper circulating in the neighbourhood of such lands tene-
ments and hereditaments.
Provided also that when any such court shall decree or
order the payment of money, the clerk of such court shall,
upon the application of the person entitled under such de-
cree or order, deliver to such person a certificate in the
form in the Second Part of the Sixteenth Schedule to this
Act directed to the clerk of any other Court of Mines, and
shall make a minute thereof in the register to be kept by
such first-mentioned clerk as hereby provided ; and such
certificate, if forwarded to the clerk to whom the same shall
be directed, shall be filed by him, and thereupon execution
shall issue as upon a decree or order of the court to the
clerk of which such certificate shall have been directed.

land or building occupied or held under a miner’s right or
business licence or any share or interest at law or in equity
therein, whether under a warrant issued out of a Court of
Mines or by a warden as hereinafter provided for, such
bailiff shall give to the purchaser thereof a certificate of

the hearing of any suit or of such appeal as aforesaid in
any court or under any decision of any warden as herein-
after provided for a certificate of which decision shall have
been filed in any court holden under this Part of this Act
shall remain unsatisfied either in the whole or in part, it
shall be lawful for the person entitled to recover such
money, whether any such warrant as aforesaid or as herein-
after provided to be granted by a warden in case of the
non-payment of any debt costs or damages awarded by the
decision of a warden shall or shall not have been issued for
the same, to obtain from the clerk of the said court a sum-
mons in the form contained in the Seventeenth Schedule to
this Act or to the like effect directed to the person liable
to pay such money ; and such summons may by order of the
judge of such court be made returnable before the same or
any other Court of Mines or any judge of any Court of
Mines, but without such order such summons shall be made
returnable at the place at and before the court out of which
it shall be issued and such summons shall be served person-
ally. If the person so liable shall appear in pursuance of
such summons at such place as shall be therein named, he
may be examined upon oath touching his estate and effects
and as to the property and means he has of paying satis-
fying and discharging such sum of money or such part
thereof as shall remain unsatisfied and as to the disposal
he may have made of any property and as to his intention
to leave Victoria without paying such money or part as
shall be still unsatisfied or to depart elsewhere within Vic-
toria with intent to evade payment thereof and as to the
mode in which the liability the subject of such decree or
decision was contracted. The person obtaining such
summons as aforesaid and all other witnesses whom the
court shall think requisite may be examined upon oath
touching the inquiries authorised to be made as aforesaid.
186, If a party so summoned as aforesaid shall not
attend as required by such summons and shall not allege a
sufficient excuse for not attending, or shall if attending
refuse to be sworn or to disclose any of the things aforesaid,
or if he shall not make answer touching the same to the
satisfaction of the court or judge before whom such sum-
mons shall be returnable, or if it shall appear to such court
or judge by oral testimony or affidavit or by both that the
said party contracted the liability which was the subject of
such decree order or decision by any fraud or breach of


trust or has made or caused to be made any gift delivery or
transfer of any property or charged removed or concealed
the same with intent to defraud the person entitled to such
money as aforesaid or with intent to defeat any execution
issued upon such decree order or decision, or if on such
evidence as aforesaid it shall appear to the satisfaction of
such court that the party so summoned has then or has had
since the time of making such decree order or decision
sufficient means and ability to pay the sum so recovered
against him and so due and unsatisfied as aforesaid or that
he is about to leave Victoria without paying such money
as shall then be still unsatisfied or to depart elsewhere
within Victoria with intent to evade payment thereof, it
shall be lawful for such court or judge (if it or he shall
think fit) to order that, unless such party shall pay into the
court before which or the judge of which such summons
shall have been returnable either forthwith or within the
time limited in such order the money so unsatisfied together
with the costs of and occasioned by such summons and
examination, he shall be committed to prison for any period
not exceeding six months.

case such order of commitment under the hand of the judge
of the court by which or of the judge by whom such order

upon such warden surveyor registrar or other officer to show
cause at a place within the district of such court or by con-
sent at any other place and time to be named therein why
he should not perform the duty so stated to be neglected or
refused to be performed ; and if the officer named in such
order shall fail to show to the satisfaction of the judge that

veyor registrar or other officer to perform such duty within

hundred and ninety-fourth to the two hundred and second
hereof inclusive may be made at any place in Victoria where
such judge shall happen to be at the time of the application
to him therefor, or at any other place in Victoria to which
he shall adjourn the hearing of the said application and may
be in the form contained in the Twenty-first Schedule to
this Act without any further recital than is directed by
such form ; and every such order shall (except the judge
shall otherwise order) be served by delivering a copy to the
person to be bound thereby and at the same time showing
the original order if such person shall require to see the
same ; and every such order may be filed with the clerk of
any court within the district for which such judge shall be
appointed or of the court in which any suit or proceeding in
which such order may have been made shall have been
instituted or be depending, and shall be enforced and pro-
ceeded on in all respects like any decree of such court. If
the judge shall see fit so to order, it shall be sufficient ser-
vice of any injunction order or of any order appointing a
manager or receiver to lodge a copy of such order in the
office of the warden of the district in which the land referred
to in such order shall be situated, and to publish a copy of
such order in some newspaper circulating within such dis-
trict, and to affix a copy of such order in some conspicious
place upon the land referred to thereby.
205. On the application of any person to a judge of a
Court of Mines stating that any owner of such land water
race dam or reservoir as mentioned in section one hundred
and thirty-five hereof or of any share or interest therein is
a lunatic and incapable of managing the same, such judge
shall, in case he shall be satisfied that no committee has
been appointed for such owner as a lunatic, enquire into
the matter upon such evidence and by such means as he
shall think proper, and shall direct such notice of the appli-
cation as he shall think right to be given to such of the re-
lations or friends of the alleged lunatic as he shall think
just; and if he shall be of opinion that such statement is
true, he shall by order under his hand appoint a guardian
of such lunatic with such remuneration for the performance
of his duties, to be payable out of the profits of such land
water race dam or reservoir share or interest, as such judge
shall think just.
Such guardian shall before entering upon the duties of his
office give security for the due performance of such acts and
duties, and for the fulfilment of such conditions as such


lunatic should perform and fulfil for the preservation of his ‘
interests as such owner having regard to the nature of the
property of which he shall so be the owner, and for
accounting for the income thereof, as such judge shall think
proper ; and every such guardian shall as to such property
have the same powers and perform the same duties as are
now or shall be prescribed by law in the case of committees
of lunatics in respect of their estates, but only until any
such committee shall be regularly appointed or until such
guardian’s removal from his office by an order of the said
judge; and the judge who shall have appointed such
guardian shall in respect of such property have and exer-
cise the same jurisdiction over such guardian as the
Supreme Court is or shall be empowered to exercise in re-
spect of the estates of lunatics over committees of their
estates appointed according to law ; and every such lunatic
shall sue and defend in any court holden under this Part of
this Act or before any warden by such guardian.
Provided that for the purpose of this section the word
“lunatic” shall mean any person who shall in the opinion of
such judge after such inquiry as aforesaid be lunatic or of
unsound mind ; and every such order shall be filed with the
clerk of the court whose office shall be nearest to such
property; and a copy of such order sealed with the seal of such
court and signed and certified by such clerk as a true copy
shall be receivable as primd facie evidence in all courts of
the matters therein stated, and of the due appointment as
such guardian of the person therein stated to be so appointed.
206. The clerk of every Court of Mines shall cause a
minute of all plaints decrees and orders of the court and
executions and returns thereto and of all proceedings of the
said court or of the judge thereof to be entered in a register
to be kept by him for the purpose, such register to be in the
form prescribed by such general regulations as aforesaid ;
and a document purporting to be a copy of any such entry
in the said register, and to bear the seal of such court, and
to be signed and certified as a true copy by the clerk who
shall have the custody thereof, shall at all times be ad-
mitted in all courts and places whatsoever as evidence of
such entry and of the proceedings referred to thereby, and
of the regularity of such proceedings without any further
proof.

grant as often as such court or judge shall deem proper a
rehearing of any suit in or appeal to such court or a new
trial before assessors of any issue or question of fact therein ;
and for that purpose (if necessary) to set aside any decree
or order made in such suit or appeal or on any rehearing
thereof or any verdict given on the trial or any new trial
of any such issue or question of fact. Provided that, within
seven days after such decree or order shall have been made
or the verdict on any such trial or new trial shall have been
given, the party applying for such rehearing or new trial
shall serve upon the opposite party a notice that the appli-
cation therefor will be made at the expiration of two days
from the day of the service of such notice or on the first
day thereafter on which the same can be heard ; and upon
the hearing of such application the court or judge shall fix
the time for such rehearing or new trial if the same shall
be granted and direct such notice thereof to be given and
in such manner as it or he shall think right to any of the
parties; and in the case of a rehearing it shall be lawful
for the court or judge to direct or for either of the parties
to require that any particular question of fact material to
the issue between the parties shall be tried before such
court and six assessors. Provided that in case of either of
the parties so requiring such party shall require the same
at the time at which the rehearing shall be granted, and
shall also then give notice to the clerk of the court that he
so requires and lodge with such clerk the sum of six pounds
twelve shillings for the assessors ; and the provisions herein-
before contained as to trials of issues and questions of fact
by assessors shall be applicable to new trials of issues and
questions of fact and to the case of assessors directed or
required on the granting of rehearings.
208. Any party to any suit in any Court of Mines who
shall be dissatisfied with the granting of an application
for the rehearing of such suit may appeal from the order
granting the same to the Pull Court within seven days after
such application shall have been granted, and the said Pull
Court shall have the like jurisdiction with respect to such
appeal as if the same were expressly given by this Act.
209. On the hearing or rehearing of any such suit or
appeal or upon the trial or new trial of any issue in any
Court of Mines it shall be lawful for the judge of such court
(if he shall think fit) to reserve any question in the form


of a special case for the opinion of the Supreme Court
which opinion such Supreme Court is to give ; and in such
case no decree or order shall be made in respect of any
matter on which such question shall have been reserved
until such opinion shall have been given ; and every such
special case shall after it shall have been prepared by such
judge be transmitted by the clerk of the court to the
Prothonotary of the Supreme Court who shall cause the
same to be set down for argument before the said Supreme
Court.
210. Any party to any suit in any Court of Mines or to
any proceeding before the judge of any such court (except
where the contrary is herein provided) who shall be dis-
satisfied with any decree or order of the said court or with
any order of a judge thereof not being an order of commit-
ment made by such court or judge may appeal from the
same to the Full Court. Provided he shall, within ten
days after such decree or order or in case an application
shall have been made for the rehearing of any suit then
within seven days after such application shall have been
refused or if granted after the decision upon such rehearing
or the abandonment by notice to the opposite party or the
discharge for want of prosecution of the order therefor, give
notice in writing of such appeal to the opposite party or his
attorney, and also to give security (to be approved by the
clerk of the said Court of Mines) for the costs of the appeal,
or in lieu of giving such security deposit in the hands of
such clerk the sum of Twenty-five pounds to answer the
costs of the appeal if such appeal should be dismissed ; and
every such notice of appeal shall set forth the grounds
thereof ; and every such appeal shall be decided by the said
Full Court on the facts as agreed on between the parties or
their attorneys or counsel or stated by the judge from the
order of whom or by the judge of the court from the decree
or order of which such appeal shall be brought; and such
facts shall be set forth in the form of a case agreed on by
both parties or their attorneys or counsel; and if they can-
not agree, the judge shall settle such case and sign it; and
the appellant shall within four weeks from the day of the
service of such notice or within such other time as such
judge shall from time to time direct transmit such case and
a copy of the said notice of appeal to the said Prothonotary,
who shall cause the same to be set down to be argued before

appeal and make such order therein as shall appear just, and
may either dismiss such appeal or reverse or vary such de-
cree or discharge or vary such order and may direct the
cause to be reheard before the Supreme Court, but shall
not in any case remit the cause for rehearing before the
judge of the court from which such appeal shall have
been brought, and may make such order with respect to the
costs of the said appeal and of the suit or proceeding in
which such decree or order shall have been made as it may
think proper; and every such order of the Full Court shall
be final, and shall be deemed to be and shall be a final
order of the Supreme Court of Victoria for the purposes
and within the meaning of any Orders of Her Majesty in
Council now or hereafter to be in force in relation to appeals
from the Supreme Court of Victoria.
212. No appeal from any decree or order of any such
Court of Mines or judge thereof to the said Full Court shall
lapse or from the coming into operation hereof shall be
deemed to have lapsed in consequence of the death removal
or resignation of such judge after such decree or order shall

or resignation may be proceeded with heard and determined
by the said Full Court; and the successor of such judge so
dying or being removed or resigning shall have the like
powers of settling and signing the case on such appeal as
such judge could have exercised had he lived or continued
in office.
213. As soon as the opinion of the Supreme Court shall
have been given upon any special case or the decision of
the Full Court pronounced upon any appeal, the said
Prothonotary shall cause the same to be drawn up and
shall transmit the same to the clerk of the court from the
decree or order of which or from the order of the judge of
which such appeal shall have been brought; and in the
case of a special case, the judge who shall have reserved
the same shall make his decree or order in accordance with
the opinion given thereon; and in the case of an appeal, if
the same shall have been dismissed, the decree or order
appealed from shall be proceeded on as if there had been no
appeal; but if such decree or order shall have been
reversed or varied, the clerk of the court by which or by
the judge of which such decree or order shall have been
made shall enter in the register to be kept by him as


aforesaid a minute of such reversal or variation with the
nature of the variation, and in the case of a decree shall
amend in accordance therewith the decree so as aforesaid
to be filed in his office or to be annexed to such engross-
ment as aforesaid; and the decree or order as reversed or
varied shall be deemed to be the decree or order of such
last-mentioned court or judge, and shall be proceeded on
accordingly.
214. Whenever any such special case shall have been
reserved or any such appeal brought or be about to be
brought, it shall be lawful for the court the judge of which
shall have reserved such case or from the decree or order of
which or from the order of the judge whereof the appeal
shall have been brought or for such judge, on the applica-
tion of any of the parties interested in such case or appeal,
to make such order for an injunction or receiver or payment
of money into court or in the case of an appeal for stay of
proceedings or otherwise and upon such terms as such
court or judge shall think proper ; but without such order
no appeal shall operate as a stay of proceedings.

dant is and claims to be entitled to be in possession, and
concerning any trespass upon any such land of which the
complainant is in the occupation or possession and claims
to be entitled to possess under such licence, and concerning
any money claimed to be due to the complainant upon any
mining partnership account or as in any way accruing to
the complainant from any mining partnership adventure or
interest; and also to hear and determine all suits which

tribution as ascertained according to the provisions of any
by-law of a mining board towards the expenses of any
appliances for raising or lifting water or of the working
thereof, and also all suits which may be brought for the
recovery of any sum of money which any person shall be
liable to pay under the provisions of this Part of this Act
or of any such by-law and for which no other mode of
recovery is hereby provided; and such jurisdiction shall
extend not only to cases where the litigants shall be the
parties originally interested in the causes of suit, but also
to cases where the title of any of such litigants shall be
derived as assignee or otherwise from or through any of
such parties. Provided always that where any sum of
money shall be claimed to be due in respect of a debt
or of a contract or upon partnership account or as accruing
to the complainant from any mining partnership adventure
or interest, such jurisdiction shall not extend to cases where
such sum shall exceed One hundred pounds; and in all
cases of debt or contract the decision of the warden or
assessors as hereinafter provided for shall be final.
217. It shall not be lawful for any complainant to divide
any claim for the purpose of bringing two or more suits be-
fore a warden ; but any complainant may in any case of
debt or contract abandon the excess of his claim beyond
One hundred pounds, and shall on proving his case recover
to an amount not exceeding that sum ; and the decision of
the warden upon the complaint of such complainant shall
be for that amount, and in full discharge of all demands in
respect of such claim, and shall be final.
218. If on the hearing of any case in the Court of Mines
in which the demand shall be in respect of a debt or con-
tract only the plaintiff shall not recover more than One


hundred pounds, he shall not, though succeeding, be entitled
to receive any costs other than he would have been entitled
to had he proceeded before a warden, unless the judge shall
certify that the case was one which from special circum-
stances it was proper should be brought in such court.
219. Every such proceeding as aforesaid before the
warden shall be commenced by a summons, which, if the
proceeding be for the recovery of any land race dam or
reservoir or in respect of any encroachment or trespass
thereon, shall be in the form in the Twenty-second Schedule
hereto ; and if for any other purpose, in the form in the
Twenty-third Schedule hereto ; and every such summons
shall be issued by the warden upon the application of any
person to him therefor, and shall be filled up according to
the nature of the applicant’s case, and shall require the de-
fendant to appear before the said or some other warden on a
day to be named and inserted in the summons by the said
warden; and upon the day named in such summons or
upon any adjourned day of hearing which the warden shall
direct, and upon proof of such service of such summons as
the warden shall think sufficient, he shall proceed to inves-
tigate the matter of such complaint; and in the presence of
all the parties interested, or of such of them as shall appear
to such warden sufficiently to represent all the parties
interested, or in the absence of any of the parties interested
who having been duly served with such summons shall not
appear, shall hear receive and examine evidence and deter-
mine such complaint in a summary way with full power to
adjourn the hearing of such complaint to any other time or
place and with full liberty to the warden to amend such
complaintTby the addition of any other persons as complai-
nants or defendants or otherwise.
220. The Governor in Council may appoint one or more
clerks for each warden, either by the name of such warden
or of the districts or places or any of them in or at which
such warden shall usually sit; and any such clerk may sign
in the name of such warden and issue any such summons as
in the last preceding section mentioned, and every such
summons so signed and issued shall be deemed and taken
to be issued by such warden within the meaning of the said
section.
221. Any warden may at any time either before or at the
hearing of any summons if satisfied by affidavit that any

of such summons upon such person or in such manner as by
such order shall be directed shall be deemed good service
upon such defendant, and if necessary may postpone the
hearing of such summons to allow of substituted service,
and service of such summons in the manner directed by such
order shall be good service to all intents and purposes.
222. Any warden may upon the hearing of any summons
amend the same by striking out any one or more of the
complainants upon such terms as to costs or otherwise as to
such warden shall seem fit.
223. Every warden shall keep a register in the form in
the Twenty-fourth Schedule to this Act; in which he shall
enter the several complaints laid before him with the names
and the last known place of abode of the parties, the nature
of the relief sought, and where the claim is pecuniary the
amount sought to be recovered; and every one of such
plaints shall be numbered in every year according to the
order in which they shall be entered.
224. Every person who shall obtain a summons from a
warden shall at the time of obtaining the same specify the
amount sought to be recovered by such summons so far as
the demand shall be pecuniary, and such amount shall be
entered in the said register in the proper column for that
purpose; and it shall be lawful for the defendant at any
time before the said summons shall be heard to pay to the
warden such amount together with the costs incurred by
the complainant in respect thereof up to the time of such
payment and of delivering the notice next hereinafter
mentioned; and notice of such payment shall be communi-
cated by the warden to the complainant by causing the same
to be delivered at his usual or last-known place of abode or
business, and the said amount shall be paid to the complai-
nant and the said costs to the complainant or his attorney :
and after such payment no other proceeding shall be brought
in any court in respect of the demand in satisfaction of
which such amount shall have been so paid.
225. Any defendant in any proceeding before a warden
for or which shall include a money demand may, at any
time before the summons shall be heard, pay to the warden
such sum of money as he shall think a full satisfaction for


such demand together with the costs incurred by the com-
plainant up to the time of such payment and of delivering
the notice next hereinafter mentioned; and notice of such
payment shall be communicated by the warden to the com-
plainant by causing the same to be delivered at his usual or
last known place of abode or business, and the said sum of
money shall be paid to the complainant and the said costs
to the complainant or his attorney: but if the complainant
shall elect to proceed and shall recover no further sum in
respect of such money demand than shall have been so paid
to the warden, he shall pay to such defendant the costs
incurred by him in the said proceeding after such payment,
and the warden may decree the same accordingly.
226. Previously to the issuing of any such summons as
aforesaid, the fee of two shillings and sixpence shall be paid
by the complainant to the warden; and the said fee shall
be deemed to be a part of the costs of the hearing.
227. No complaint shall be dismissed by any warden
because of any informality either in the summons itself or
in the entry thereof ; nor shall any objection be taken or
allowed to any such summons or complaint for any alleged
defect or misnomer or inaccurate description of any person
or place, or on the ground that the complainant shall appear
at the hearing of the summons to be entitled to different
relief from that which is sought thereby therein, or for any
variance between such summons and the evidence adduced
on the part of the complainant; but such summons shall be
amended by the warden so that the subject-matter in
dispute between the pai'ties shall plainly appear, and the
warden shall proceed to adjudicate according to the rights
of the parties. Provided always that if it shall appear to
the warden upon the hearing of the case that the defendant
has been thereby deceived or misled and that injustice
would be done by proceeding at once with the case, it shall
be lawful for such warden, on such terms as to costs or
otherwise as he shall think fit, to adjourn the further
hearing of the case to some future day.
228. Every warden shall make or cause to be made a list
of persons not less than fifty in number, or of such a
number under and as near fifty as the population of the
neighbourhood will permit, of good repute and who shall be
holders of miners’ rights or business licences residing within
the district wherein such warden shall have jurisdiction;

and the said list shall be the roll of warden’s assessors of
such district.
229. It shall be lawful for either of the parties previously
to the hearing of any such complaint to require from the
warden, or for the warden either before or during such
hearing to require, that such complaint shall be heard be-
fore such warden and four assessors ; and thereupon such
warden shall summon before him either orally or in writing
a sufficient number of the persons whose names shal 1 appear
upon such roll as aforesaid, or, if there shall be no such roll
or if a sufficient number of persons whose names shall be on
such roll cannot be found, then of indifferent persons to
act as such assessors, until the number of four assessors
shall be obtained. Provided also that before any assessors
shall be summoned by any warden, such warden shall
demand and receive the sum of Two pounds from the per-
son demanding assessors; and each of the assessors before
whom the complaint is heard shall be entitled to receive
thereout the sum of ten shillings ; and in case the hearing
of any complaint shall be adjourned to any future day, the
warden shall demand and receive the further sum of two
pounds for every such adjournment, and each of the assessors
shall be entitled to receive thereout the further sum of ten
shillings. Provided that where the warden without a
requisition from either of the parties shall summon
assessors, the warden shall before the hearing demand and
receive from the complainant the sum of two pounds as
aforesaid and also in case of any such adjournment such
further sum of two pounds for the payment of such assessors
at the rate aforesaid ; and any part of any of such sums which
shall not be required for the payment of assessors shall be
returned to the complainant, and the residue thereof shall
eventually be paid as part of the cost of the proceeding by
such of the parties as the warden shall in that behalf
direct.
230. Either party shall be admitted to challenge any
number of persons called as assessors not exceeding two
without assigning cause, and any additional number pro-
vided he assigns of his challenge a cause certain ; and the
truth of such challenges shall be inquired of by the warden.
231. Any person so summoned who without lawful
excuse shall neglect or refuse to attend or to be sworn or
serve as such assessor shall be fined such sura of money not
exceeding Five pounds as such warden shall think fit.


233. Before such warden and assessors shall proceed to
hear any such complaint, such warden shall administer to
each of such assessors an oath in the form in the Twenty-
afth Schedule to this Act. Provided that if any of such
assessors shall be unwilling from alleged conscientious
motives to be sworn, it shall be lawful for the warden upon
being satisfied of the sincerity of such objection to permit
such person instead of being sworn to make his solemn
affirmation and declaration in the words contained in the
Twenty-sixth Schedule to this Act, which affirmation and
declaration shall be of the same force and effect as if such
person had taken an oath in the usual form ; and on such
oath being administered or affirmation and declaration
made, such warden and assessors shall proceed to hear such
complaint the matter of which shall be decided by the
assessors with the assistance of the warden on any point of
law ; and the decision of the majority of them shall have
the same force and effect as the decision of such warden if
acting alone would have had : but if after the expiration of
two hours from the time at which the case shall have been
left to the assessors they shall intimate to the warden that
a majority of them cannot agree upon a verdict, then such
warden shall himself decide such complaint; and every
such decision shall be carried into effect by the same or any
other warden.
233. Either of the parties shall be at liberty, previously
to or during the hearing of any complaint, to apply to a
warden for inspection to be made by such warden or warden
and assessors of any land claim water race drain dam or
easement in dispute ; and if the party so applying shall
satisfy such warden as to the propriety and reasonable-
ness of his application, such warden, if the case be heard
before him alone, shall make such inspection ; but if heard
before him and assessors, shall make an order for such
inspection by the assessors upon payment to the warden by
the party so applying of such sum (if any) and upon such
terms as to the said warden shall seem reasonable ; and
thereupon the warden and assessors shall make such inspec-
tion, and any sum so paid shall be appropriated towards
defraying the expenses of the assessors by reason of such
inspection as such warden may direct : or if such warden
shall himself think that any such inspection would be
proper, he shall if the case be heard before him alone make
such inspection; or if heard before him and assessors, may,
and if required by the majority of the assessors shall, make

he shall think right; and the money paid for such expenses
shall eventually be paid as part of the costs of the proceed-
ing by such of the parties as the warden shall in that
behalf direct.
234. If before or during the hearing of any complaint it
shall appear to the warden that it will be necessary for a
survey to be made of any land or water in dispute, such
warden may order either party to cause such survey and a
plan thereof to be made ; and the costs thereof shall be
deemed to be a part of the costs of the hearing
G*
235. A minute of every decision of a warden or of
assessors in the form contained in the Twenty-seventh
Schedule to this Act or to that effect shall on the day of
the pronouncing thereof be entered by such warden in the
register to be kept as hereinbefore provided ; and such
warden shall make an order in accordance with such
decision, and write the same in the said register under the
said decision; and such decision with said order so under-
written shall be signed by the warden, and no formal order
or other record of such decision shall be necessary ; and
every such entry whether of the decision of a warden’or of
assessors shall be made in form as the decision of the
warden ; and the expression “ decision of a warden ” where
it occurs in this Part of this Act shall (if not inconsistent
with the context or subject-matter) be taken to include the
decision of assessors. A copy of such minute or order shall
on demand be given to any of the parties interested therein;
and the decision of a warden shall be binding and conclusive
on all parties, unless in cases where on appeal therefrom
(where such appeal shall be permitted) the same shall be
reversed or varied ; and a document purporting to be any
such copy, signed and certified as a true copy by the warden
who shall have the custody of such register describing him-
self as having such custody, shall at all times be admitted
in all courts and places whatsoever as evidence of such
decision or order and of such custody without any further
proof.
236. It shall be lawful for any warden, upon such terms
(if any) as to payment of costs or otherwise as such war-
den shall think fit, to grant as often as such warden shall
deem proper a rehearing of any complaint decided by him
or by assessors before him; and for that purpose (if neces-


sary) to set aside any decision or order made on such
complaint or upon any rehearing thereof.
Provided that within seven days after such decision shall
have been made, the party applying for such rehearing
shall serve upon the opposite party a notice that the appli-
cation therefor will be made at the expiration of two days
from the day of the service of such notice or on the first
day thereafter on which the same can be heard ; and upon
the hearing of such application the warden shall fix the
time and place for such rehearing if the same shall be
granted, and direct such notice thereof to be given and in
such manner as he shall think right to any of the parties.
It shall be lawful for the warden to direct or for either
of the parties to require that such rehearing shall be heard
before the warden and four assessors; provided that in case
of either of the parties so requiring, such party shall
require the same at the time the rehearing shall be granted
or at such other time as the warden shall permit, and shall
also then lodge with the warden the sum of two pounds for
the assessors, and the provisions hereinbefore contained as
to hearings before wardens and assessors shall be applicable
to rehearings before them.
On any proceeding before a warden or warden and asses-
sors it shall be lawful for such warden (if he shall think
tit) to reserve any question in the form of a special case for
the opinion of the Supreme Court; and in such case no
order shall be made in respect of any matter on which such
question shall have been reserved until such opinion shall
have been given ; and every such special case shall after it
shall ha ve been prepared by such warden be transmitted by
him to the Prothonotary of the Supreme Court, who shall
cause the same to be set down for argument before the
said Supreme Court, whose opinion when given shall be
drawn up and transmitted by said master to the said
warden, who shall make his order in accordance with such
opinion. A.nd whenever any such special case shall have
been reserved, it shall be lawful for the warden who shall
have reserved the same, on the application of any of the
parties interested in such case, to make such order for an
injunction or receiver or payment of money into the hands
of the said warden or otherwise and upon such terms as
such warden shall think proper.

or the limits and quantity to be taken by either of the
parties of such water, if necessary so to do for the purpose
of terminating the dispute ; and if the complainant shall
succeed, shall determine whether any and what sum in the
nature of mesne profits should be paid to the complainant;
and in the event of the complainant so succeeding, the
warden shall order possession of such land race drain dam
reservoir or water or share to be delivered to the com-
plainant and any such sum to be paid to him; and shall, or
any other warden may, cause such complainant to be put
into possession of any such land race drain dam reservoir
or water or share as aforesaid, and (if necessary) cause or
order any defendant his servants buildings fixtures imple-
ments goods and chattels to be removed therefrom or from

and if the complainant shall succeed, such warden shall
declare him at liberty to divert or remove the same, and
may make an order enjoining any defendant from prevent-
ing such diversion or removal.
239. In case any such proceeding shall be in respect of
any encroachment or trespass upon or any unlawful inter-
ference with or injury to any such land race drain dam
reservoir or water, such warden or assessors shall determine

land or the limits or quantity to be taken by either of the
parties of such water, if necessary so to do for the purpose
of terminating the dispute; and at the same time assess
the amount to be paid to the complainant by way of
damages (if any) by reason of any such encroachment tres-
pass interference or injury found to have been committed;
and the warden shall order such damages to be paid accord-
ingly, an d that the person found to have encroached or
trespassed interfered or injured as aforesaid do cease from
such encroachment trespass interference or injury ; and it
shall be lawful for the same or any other warden to cause
the person so found to have encroached trespassed inter-
fered or injured his servants implements good and chattels


to be removed from the land race drain dam reservoir or
water so encroached or trespassed upon interfered with or
injured or from the using of such water, and to cause such
complainant to be put into possession thereof.
240. In case any such proceeding shall be in relation to
any debt or contract or to money due in respect of any
such land or water or any share or interest therein, or in
respect of any gold or other metals or minerals, or in rela-
tion to any such gold metals or minerals or to the amount
of any contribution or other sum of money (suits for the
recovery of which the warden is hereby authorised to hear
and determine) the warden shall order any money or
damages or gold or other metals or minerals which he or
any such assessors shall find due or payable or deliverable
by either of the parties to the other of them to be paid or
delivered. And in case such proceeding shall be in respect
of money due or gold or other metals or minerals deliver-
able upon a mining partnership account or accruing to the
complainant from any mining partnership adventure or
interest, the warden or the assessors shall take the account
of such partnership adventure or interest, so far as shall be
necessary to ascertain what sum or amount of gold or other
metals or minerals (if any) shall be so due or accruing; and
the warden shall order any such sum or gold to be paid or
delivered.
241. All constables and peace officers shall within their
several jurisdictions aid and assist the warden in the execu-
tion of any of the duties imposed upon him by any of the
preceding sections.
242, Whenever in or by any decision in any of the said
cases before a warden or a warden and assessors any sum
of money shall be awarded by way of debt damages or costs
or otherwise and the same shall not be forthwith paid, such
warden, or any other warden on production to such other
warden of a copy of such decision signed and certified as a
true copy by the warden who shall have the custody of the

required to do and perform in respect of a warrant issued
out of a Court of Mines in the case of the non-payment of
money decreed or ordered to be paid by such court.
Every such bailiff may by virtue of such warrant seize
and take such property as and dispose thereof in the manner

decision shall have been made. Provided also that when-
ever in any of the cases aforesaid any order shall be made
by a warden other than or besides an order for the payment
of money, the same may be enforced under the provisions
of section two hundred and forty-nine hereof, but without

the provisions hereof be enforced.
( h ) Special Powers and Duties
243. Notwithstanding any of the provisions hereinbefore
contained, it shall be lawful for such warden, if he shall


think fit, at the time of the making of any such decision by
him or by any such assessors, to order that any auriferous
earth in the possession of and belonging to the party by
whom payment of any sum in respect of any such debt
damages or costs shall be ordered to the extent in value of
such sum (such value to be fixed by such warden or
assessors) shall be delivered up to the party entitled to such
sum by way of satisfaction or in part satisfaction thereof;
and such warden shall forthwith cause such earth to the
extent aforesaid to be seized and delivered accordingly ; and
thereupon a minute of such order in the form contained in
the Twenty-seventh Schedule to this Act or to that effect
shall be entered and signed in the register aforesaid ; and a
warrant for the balance only of such sum after deducting
the value of the earth seized and delivered as aforesaid shall
be granted by such warden.
244. It shall be lawful for any warden in his discretion,
upon the application of any person claiming to be legally or
equitably interested in any claim or in any land com-
prised in any lease (granted under the provisions of
any Act authorizing the granting of leases for mining
for gold or for metals or minerals other than gold)
or in any other land adjoining any claim or land com-
prised as aforesaid, by writing under the hand of such
warden to authorize the applicant together with a mining
surveyor or some experienced miner to enter upon any
claim or land (whether at the time of such application

any person whomsoever any information obtained upon or
by such entry, save only as to whether such owner or
occupier is encroaching on the said first-mentioned claim or
land ; and every person who shall act contrary to such
declaration shall forfeit and pay any sum not exceeding
Fifty pounds.
245. It shall be lawful for any warden upon the applica-
tion of any person claiming to be legally or equitably inter-
ested in any land claim water race drain dam reservoir or
easement, such application to be made on notice served
twenty-four hours at least before the time for the making
thereof on the parties interested in opposing the same or
such of them as shall appear to such warden sufficiently to
represent the parties so interested, in the presence of such
parties or such of them as aforesaid or in the absence of
any of them upon whom service of such notice shall be
proved to the satisfaction of the warden, to hear receive
and examine evidence.
And thereupon, if he in his discretion shall think fit, and
upon such terms (if any) as he may consider just, by order
under his hand to enjoin any person named in such order
from encroaching upon occupying using or working such
land claim water race drain dam reservoir or easement, or
from seeking for washing out winning extracting or remov-
ing any earth gold or metal or mineral other than gold
taken from such land, or from selling or disposing of or
damaging or otherwise interfering with such land claim
water race drain dam reservoir easement or earth gold metal
or mineral or any share or interest therein respectively, or
from doing any act whereby the right title or interest of
such applicant in or to the same might be affected ; and
every such order shall operate and be in force for such a
period as shall be named therein unless the same shall be
sooner discharged by the warden making the same or by
the judge of any Court of Mines.
Provided that if endeavours reasonable in the opinion of
the warden to serve such of the said parties as in his
opinion would be necessary to represent the parties so
interested shall be proved to the satisfaction of such
warden to have failed, it shall be sufficient service of such


notice if the same shall be advertised in some newspaper
circulating in, or if none in, then in the newspaper or one
of the newspapers circulating nearest to, the district in
which the subject matter of the application shall be situated,
and which shall be published twenty-four hours at least be-
fore the time for the making of the application ; and on
every such application the said warden shall make such
order as to costs as to him shall seem just.
246. If by reason of the pressing emergency of any par-
ticular case it shall seem proper to the warden so to do, he
may, on the application of any such personas last aforesaid
but without any notice, by order under his hand grant such
injunction as last aforesaid ; but to be in force for a period
of seven days only inclusive of the day upon which such
order shall have been made, or until the same shall by the
said warden be discharged. And no second order for an
injunction shall be made for the same cause under this sec-
tion ; but any person at whose instance any injunction shall
have been granted under this section shall be at liberty, at
any time before the expiration of the said period of seven
days as well as thereafter, to apply under the provisions of
the section next preceding for an injunction for any longer
period.
247. It shall be lawful for any warden, upon the applica-
tion of any party to any proceeding on summons before him
(such application to be made on notice served twelve hours
at least before the time for the making thereof on the
parties interested in opposing the same or such of them as
shall appear to such warden sufficiently to represent the
parties so interested) in the presence of such parties or such
of them as aforesaid or in the absence of any of them upon
whom service of such notice shall be proved to the satisfac-
tion of such warden, by order under his hand to direct any
person party to or interested in such proceeding to deposit,

person or at any place named in such order, in the name of
such warden or 6f any other person mentioned in such order

to which will in the opinion of such warden be put in issue
in the course of such proceeding Provided that service of
the notice hereby required may be made by advertisement
under the circumstances and in the manner mentioned in
the section next preceding but one as to the notice by that
section required.
248. Every order made by a warden under any of the
four next preceding sections may be in the form contained
in the Twenty-eighth Schedule to this Act or to that effect,
without any further recital than is directed by such form ;
and every such order shall (except the warden shall other-
wise order) be served by delivering a copy to the person to
be bound thereby and at the same time showing the
original order if such person shall require to see the same ;
and every such order shall be entered by the warden who
shall have made the same in the register to be kept by him
as aforesaid. Provided that if the warden shall see fit so to
order, it shall be sufficient service of any injunction order,
or of any order directing gold metals or minerals or other
property to be deposited, to publish a copy of such order in
such newspaper and to affix a copy thereof in such con-
spicuous place at or near the property in dispute (if any) as
the warden shall direct.
249. In case any person named in any of such orders
’ (not being an order for the payment of money) and intended
to be bound thereby shall disobey the same, it shall be law-
ful for any person entitled to the benefit thereof to obtain
a summons, in the form in the Nineteenth Schedule to this
Act, from the warden by whom such order shall have been
made or any other warden, requiring the party so disobey-
ing to appear at such time and place as shall be directed by
the said summons before the same or any other warden to
show cause why he should not be committed to prison for
disobedience of such order, and stating in what respects the
same has been disobeyed ; and such summons may by order
of such warden be made returnable at any place before
the same or any other warden; but without such order
such summons shall be made returnable at the place where
and before the warden by whom it shall be issued ; and such
summons shall be served personally or at such place or upon
such person or in such other manner as the warden may
under the special circumstances of the case direct. If the
person so summoned shall appear in pursuance of such sum-
mons or shall not attend as required by such summons and


no sufficient excuse shall be shown for his not so attending,
it shall be be lawful for the warden before whom such sum-
mons shall be returnable to inquire into the matters mentioned
in such summons on affidavit or on the oath of one or more
than one credible witness, or upon both oath and affidavit;
and if it shall appear to such warden that the person so
summoned has in fact knowingly disobeyed such order, it
shall be lawful for such warden, if under all the circum-
stances of the case he shall think fit, to order that such
person be committed to prison ; and thereupon the said
warden shall without any previous notice or summons to
the person so ordered to be committed issue a warrant in
the form in the Twenty-ninth Schedule to this Act or to
the like effect; and the bailiff of the Court of Mines of
the district in which such order shall have been made and
the keeper of the gaol to whom such warrant shall be
directed shall respectively execute and obey the said war-
rant ; and all constables and other peace officers within
their several jurisdictions shall aid and assist in the execu-
tion of the same.
250. Whenever any person shall be in custody under
any such warrant as last aforesaid, it shall be lawful for
the officer in whose custody such person may be, on receiv-
ing an order for that purpose under the hand of the
warden by whom such order of commitment shall have been
made or of a judge of a Court of Mines, from time to time
to bring such person before such warden or judge ; and it
shall be lawful for such warden or judge either verbally to
remand such person to his former custody ; or, if it shall
appear to such warden or judge that such person has either
performed the order for disobedience of which such person
shall have been committed or has paid to the person obtain-
ing such order of commitment or to the warden by whom
such order of commitment was made or to the clerk of the
court of which such judge shall be judge in behalf of such
last-mentioned person full compensation for the breach of
such part of the order as can no longer be performed
together with all costs subsequent to the pronouncing of
such order, including the costs of obtaining the commit-
ment or that otherwise under the special circumstances of
the case it would be proper so to do, verbally to order the
person so in custody to be forthwith discharged on such
condition as to performance of so much of the order as
then remains to be and is capable of being performed as
such judge or warden shall direct, and such person shall be

den or judge on being satisfied of the matters aforesaid,
instead of causing the person so in custody to be brought
before him, by order under his hand directed to such officer
to order the immediate discharge of such person, who shall
be discharged accordingly.
Any such order of commitment as last aforesaid
may (if the special circumstances of the case shall appear
to any such warden to warrant it) be made by such warden
ex parte and without notice, on proof by affidavit only of
the wilful disobedience of the order for the disobeying of
which such order of commitment shall be applied for ; and
upon such ex parte order being made under the hand of the
said warden, such warrant as aforesaid may be issued, and
the person ordered to be committed may be dealt with as if
an order of commitment had been made as hereinbefore
directed.
252. Whenever any sum of money awarded by way of
debt damages or costs in or by any decision of any warden
shall lemain unsatisfied in the whole or in part, the warden
who shall have the custody of the register in which such
decision shall be registered shall, on the application of the
person entitled to receive such debt damages or costs or of
any attorney on his behalf, grant to the party so applying
a certificate in the form contained in the Thirtieth Schedule
to this Act or to the like effect and it shall be lawful for
such person to file the said certificate with the clerk of the
Court of Mines of the district in which such decision shall
have been made j and thereupon such proceedings may be
had as hereinbefore provided for in the event of any such
certificate being so filed. Provided that on such applica-
tion as aforesaid the warden shall grant to the person so
a Pp!ying a certificate in the form in the second part of the
Sixteenth Schedule to this Act, directed to the clerk of any
Court of Mines; and such certificate if forwarded to such
clerk shall be filed by him ; and thereupon execution may
issue as upon a decree or order of the Court to the clerk of
which such certificate shall be directed. Provided also that
the signature to such certificate, purporting to be the sig-
nature of a warden having jurisdiction within the district
with the clerk of the Court »of Mines of which the certi-
ficate shall be filed, shall be sufficient warrant to such clerk
to act upon such certificate.


253. Whenever any warden is empowered or required by
this Part of this Act to cause any act to be performed, and
the inode of performing such act is not otherwise expressly
provided for, it shall be lawful for any person verbally
authorized by such warden and in his presence or for any
peace officer or constable authorized in writing under the
hand of such warden to perform such act \ and all peace
officers and constables shall if thereunto required aid and
assist any warden or person authorized as aforesaid in the
performance of his duty under this Part of this Act.
(c) Appeals.
254. Any person who shall be desirous of appealing from
the decision of a warden upon any hearing or rehearing of
a case before him or before him and assessors in cases where
such decision is not hereby declared to be final, and whether
the decision be a dismissal of the case or otherwise, may
appeal from the same to the Court of Mines of the district
within which such decision shall have been pronounced at
that sitting of such court which next after the expiration
of one month from the day of the making of such decision
shall be held nearest to the place at which such decision
shall have been made. Provided that such person shall
within ten days from the day of the making of such deci-
sion deposit with the clerk of such court at the place where
such sitting is to be held the sum of ten pounds to abide
the costs of such appeal, and shall also within the same ten
days serve upon the parties interested in supporting such
decision or upon such of them as shall appear to such court
to represent all the parties interested or in case no such
person can be found upon the warden before whom or
before whom and assessors the case in which such decision
shall have been made was heard, a notice in writing in the
form in the Thirty-first Schedule to this Act stating the
intention to appeal and the grounds of such appeal and the
time and place at which such appeal will be heard.
255. If either party to any proceeding in a warden’s

the time by this Part of this Act limited for service thereof
order that service of such notice of appeal upon such person
or in such manner as by such order shall be directed shall
be deemed good service upon such respondent, and service
of such notice of appeal in the manner directed by such
order within the time limited by this Part shall be good
service to all intents and purposes. Before any appeal shall
be heard as provided for in the last but one preceding and
next following sections hereof the appellant shall deliver to
the clerk for the use of the court, or shall see that there be
provided for the use of the court a copy of the complaint be-
fore the warden and a copy of the decision thereon which is
appealed against.
257. Such appeal shall be heard at such sitting of such
court or at such other place within the mining district and
at such time as the judge of such court shall by writing
under his hand direct; and such court shall proceed to make
an order reversing or varying such decision or dismissing
such appeal; and all such orders shall be final and con-
clusive on the parties; and the judge shall (if necessary)
order payment of money or the delivery of possession of any
claim land race drain dam reservoir or water gold or other
metals or minerals or other property to the person who was
the complainant before the warden, or restitution of any
claim land or water gold or other metals or minerals or other
property as the case may require ; and in and by such
order the said court may make such order with respect to
the costs of the appeal and of the proceeding appealed from
as such court shall think fit.
258. Previously to the hearing of any complaint, the
parties thereto may agree to accept the decision of the
warden or assessors as the case may be as final ; and a
memorandum of every such agreement shall be entered by
the warden in the register to be kept by him as hereinbefore
provided ; and no appeal shall in such case be made from
the decision of the warden or of the assessors as the case
may be.
259. If upon the hearing of such appeal the subject-
matter of the dispute shall appear to the court before which
the appeal shall be heard not to exceed in value twenty
pounds, the appellant shall not although he succeeds be
entitled to receive any costs of such appeal from the opposite
party, unless the court shall be of opinion that the special
circumstances of the case entitle the appellant to costs.


260. Every such appeal shall (unless an issue shall be
directed or the trial of any fact by assessors be required as
hereinafter mentioned) be heard and determined by the
judge alone; and no ground of appeal, excepting those
stated in the notice of appeal, shall be entered upon, unless
the judge shall allow either before or at the hearing other
grounds to be added, upon such terms as to adjournment
costs or otherwise as he may think fit.
261. Upon the hearing of any such appeal the court may
(if it shall think fit) direct an issue to be tried at such time
as it shall appoint before such court and six assessors ; and
either of the parties to any such appeal may require that
some question of fact material to the issue in the appeal
shall be tried before such court and six assessors; the ver-
dict of a majority of which assessors shall in both cases be
received ; and whenever any question of fact shall be tried
on the requisition of any of the parties, the court in pro-
nouncing its order on the appeal shall act on the verdict
found on such trial; but whenever an issue shall be tried
on the direction of the court, the court in pronouncing such
order shall act or not on the verdict found on such trial as
it shall think right, and shall have power before pronouncing
such order to direct any other trial or trials of such issue.
Provided that no appellant shall be entitled so to require,
unless at the time of his depositing the said sum of ten
pounds with the clerk as aforesaid he shall give notice to
such clerk that he does so require; and in the notice of
appeal he shall inform the respondent thereof ; and no res-
pondent shall be entitled so to require, unless ten clear days
before the sitting of the court at which the appeal is to be
tried he shall give notice to such clerk that he does so
require, and serve a notice upon the appellant stating that
he has so required. Provided also that the party so requir-
ing shall at the time when he shall so require pay into
court for assessors, over and above the sum of ten pounds
which if appellant he is to deposit with the clerk as afore-
said, the sum of six pounds twelve shillings to be dealt
with in like manner as the sum of six pounds twelve
shillings to be paid for assessors in original proceedings in
the Courts of Mines is hereby directed to be dealt with.
262, The provisions of the sections hereof in regard to
the trial of issues and of questions of fact in original pio-
ceedings in the Court of Mines, and in regard to the persons
from whom assessors are to be chosen and to the summon-
ing and other proceedings in respect of assessors, shall be

applicable to the trial of such issues and questions of facts
in the case of appeals to the Courts of Mines.
263. Whenever any such appeal shall have been brought
or be about to be brought, it shall be lawful for the warden
from whose decision the appeal shall be or be about to be
brought, on the application of any of the parties interested
in such appeal, to make such order for an injunction or
receiver or payment of money into the hands of the warden
to abide the event of the appeal or for stay of proceedings
or otherwise and upon such terms as he shall think proper;
but without such order or an order to the same effect by the
judge of the court in which the appeal shall be brought, no
appeal shall operate as a stay of proceedings ■ and such
order the said warden may at any time thereafter if he
think fit discharge.
264. No appeal from the decision of a warden to the
Goui t of Mines of the district within which such decision
shall have been pronounced shall be impeded or shall lapse
or from the coming into operation hereof shall be deemed
to be impeded or to have lapsed in consequence of the office
of judge of the said court being vacant by the death removal
cessation or resignation of the judge thereof; but any
appeal whether the same shall or shall not have been partly
heard may be commenced or prosecuted before the succeed-
ing judge at the same place and as nearly as may be at the
same time as it would have been before the preceding
judge if remaining in office.
265. Upon the hearing or rehearing of any appeal from
a warden or upon any proceeding before a warden or a
warden and assessors either party to any such appeal or
proceeding may apply to the judge or warden to reserve
any question of law in the form of a special case for the
opinion of the Supreme Court, which opinion such Supreme
Court is to give, and in such case proceedings may be
stayed upon such terms as the judge or warden shall think
tit until such opinion shall have been given ; and every
such special case shall after it shall have been prepared by
such judge or warden be transmitted by the clerk of the
Court of Mines or the warden to the Prothonotary, who
shall cause the same to be set down for argument before
the said Supreme Court; and whenever any such question
shall have been reserved it shall be lawful for the judge or
warden who shall have reserved the same on the application


of any of the parties interested to make such order for an
injunction or receiver or payment of money into court or
into the hands of the said warden or otherwise and upon
such terms as such judge or warden shall think proper.
266. If the judge or the warden shall refuse upon any
such application to reserve any such question as aforesaid
no order shall be made in respect of any matter on which
such special case shall have been applied for until after the
expiration of ten days from the day of such refusal, and
the costs of and occasioned by such delay shall be in the
discretion of such judge or warden.
267. When the judge or the warden shall refuse to
reserve any such question as aforesaid the applicant may
within ten days after the day of such refusal apply to the
Supreme Court for an order nisi calling on such judge or
warden and also upon the opposite party to show cause why
any such question should not be reserved for the opinion of
such Supreme Court, and the said Supreme Court may
make the same absolute or discharge it with or without
costs as it may think proper ; and the judge or warden
upon being served with any such order absolute shall
reserve such question of law accordingly for the opinion of
such Supreme Court.
268. As soon as the opinion of the Supreme Court shall
have been given upon any such special case the Prothono-
tary shall cause the same to be drawn up, and shall trans-
mit the same to the clerk of the Court of Mines or warden ;
and the judge or warden who shall have reserved the same
shall make his order in accordance with the opinion given
on such special case, and the Supreme Court may upon the
argument of any such special case as aforesaid make such
order with respect to costs as it may think proper ; and no
appeal upon any question of law raised by any such special
case shall lie from a warden, or from a warden and asses-
sors, to a Court of Mines against any decision and order
made in accordance with any such opinion of the said
Supreme Court, but the same shall be binding and con-
clusive upon all parties.
269. After any appeal against the decision of any warden
or assessors shall have been determined, if such appeal
shall be dismissed, it shall be lawful for any warden to
proceed to enforce such decision in the same manner as
such warden might have done if no such appeal had been

brought; and in case any such decision shall be variec
upon appeal, the decision so varied shall be deemed to be
the decision of the warden whose decision shall have been
appealed against.
It shall be lawful for any warden to proceed to enforce
the decision as so varied in the same manner as if it had
been the original decision and no such appeal had beer
brought.
Provided always that if any decision when so affirmed or
varied shall contain an award of debt damages and costs or
either of them and the same shall not have been previously
paid or satisfied, or in case any decision of the Court of
Mines reversing the decision of the warden shall contain
an award of debt damages and costs or either of them or
an order for payment or repayment of money, and the
same shall not forthwith or within the time limited for that
purpose be paid or satisfied, it shall be lawful for the clerk
of the court, on the application of the person entitled to
such debt damages and costs or either of them or to such
money and without any summons or notice to the person
required to pay the same, forthwith to issue execution fer-
tile amount thereof in the same manner as if the same had
been recovered by an original proceeding in the said court;
and in case such court shall order that any money received
by any respondent under the decision appealed against shall
be paid into court, and the same shall not forthwith or
within the time limited for that purpose be paid into court,
or in case such court shall decree costs against any party to
such appeal and the same shall not be paid within the time
limited for that purpose, it shall be lawful for the clerk of
such court (upon the application of the person entitled to
receive the same and without any summons or notice to the
person required to pay the same) forthwith to issue execu-
tion for the amount thereof in the same manner as upon
any decree of the said court for payment of money, or in
case the said court of appeal shall order that possession of
any such land race drain dam reservoir or water as is here-
inbefore mentioned or of any gold or other metals or
minerals or of any share or interest therein respectively
shall be delivered or restored to any party to the appeal,
then it shall be lawful for any warden, and he is hereby
required, to cause possession thereof to be delivered or
restored to such party, and (if necessary) for that purpose
to cause to be removed from any such land race dam reser-
voir or water any other person his servants goods and chat-


tels ; and all constables and other peace officers shall assist
him in doing so.
(3) Miscellaneous Provisions.
270. It shall be lawful for any person in custody under
any order of commitment made under this Part of this
Act, upon giving reasonable notice to the person (or to one
of such persons if more than one) on whose application
such order was granted or if such person or none of such
persons can be found to the judge or warden by whom such
order was made, to apply in a summary way on affidavit to
the Supreme Court for his discharge; and it shall be lawful
for such court in its discretion and on such terms (if any)
as he shall think fit, by order under his hand directed to
the gaoler or other person in whose custody such applicant
may be, to direct that such applicant shall be discharged,
and such applicant shall be discharged accordingly. Pro-
vided that it shall not be lawful for such court upon such
application to inquire into the merits of the decree or
original order on which the order of commitment was
founded.
271. If the judge of any Court of Mines or any warden
shall not arrive at the court-house or place before one o clock
in the afternoon of any day upon which the holding of a
Court of Mines or Warden’s Court as the case may be at
such court-house or place shall have been fixed or to which
the sitting of such court shall have been adjourned, the
clerk of the Court of Mines or warden’s clerk as the case
may be shall open such court and adjourn the same to such

of being deprived of the possession of the surface thereof
or of any part of such surface as the case may be, and for
damage to the surface of the whole or any part thereof as
the case may be which may arise from the carrying on of
mining operations therein or thereon, and for the expense
of severing such land or any part thereof from other land
of the owner or occupier and for all consequential damages ;
and the right to compensation in respect of any such
damage shall not be abridged or in anywise affected by
reason that such damage would not be the subject of an
action at law. As soon as an agreement or contract has
been made it shall be forwarded to the Minister, when a
mining lease may issue to the applicant in accordance with
the regulations in the Thirty-third Schedule hereto. Not-
withstanding anything in this Part contained, an agree-
ment or contract may be entered into with the owner and
occupier for compensation being made by percentage of the
gold taken from the mines under such land or otherwise.
309. If any land or buildings thereon adjoining or in
the vicinity of any land held under any mining lease
granted under this Part of this Act be injured or depre-
ciated in value by any operations carried on by the lessee,
the owner of such land or buildings shall be entitled to
compensation for all loss and damage thereby sustained by
him, and the amount of such compensation shall be ascer-
tained in the same manner as the amount of compensation
in respect of other claims under the provisions of this Part
are ascertained.
310. In case the amount of purchase money or compen-
sation be not ascertained by agreement within one month
from the date of entry by the mining surveyor to survey
such land, then the owner or occupier respectively may
proceed before a warden or in the Court of Mines of the
mining district in which the land taken possession of is
situate, and in manner provided by Part I. of this Act (but
without assessors) to ascertain the amount of compensation
to which he may be entitled under the provisions of this
Part of this Act. And such owner or occupier respectively
shall lodge with the warden or the clerk of the said court
as the case may be two copies of his claim in the form pre-
scribed in the Thirty-fourth Schedule hereto or to the like
effect.
311. Every Court of Mines held under the provisions of
Part I. of this Act shall have original jurisdiction to hear


and determine any claim made for the value of any land
taken and for the determination of the purchase money
thereof or of any claim made for compensation under the
provisions of this Part of this Act in respect of any private
land within the mining district of such court, and every
warden shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine any
such claim which the Court of Mines is hereby empowered
to hear and determine. Provided that where any such
claim is heard and determined by a warden an appeal shall
lie to the Court of Mines in whose mining district the land
taken is situated, and the provisions of Part I. of this Act
with regard to appeals from a warden to a Court of Mines
shall be deemed to be incorporated in this Part for the pur-
pose of the bringing hearing and determining such appeal
and enforcing the decision thereon.
312. The warden or clerk of the said court shall enter or
cause to be entered in a book kept for the purpose a note
of such claim having been received numbered in the order
in which the same was received and a note of the day and
hour when the same was left with him, and as soon as
practicable thereafter shall endorse a similar note on both
the copies of such claim, one of which shall be filed in the
ofiice of the warden or of the said court as the case may be
and the other shall within fourteen days after the same
shall have been lodged be forwarded by such warden or
clerk to the Minister.
313. Such warden or clerk as the case may be shall fix a
day within thirty days after the copy of any claim has been
forwarded to the Minister, and shall also name the place for
the hearing of such claim, and give due notice thereof to
such owner or occupier and to the Minister; and the
warden or the judge of the said court shall accordingly
attend at the time and place appointed in such notice and
shall determine the amount of compensation to be paid to
such owner or occupier in respect of his claim in like
manner as far as may be practicable as proceedings are had
before the said warden or in the said court under the pro-
visions of Part I. of this Act and under any rules or regula-
tions made thereunder ; and all the powers exercisable
thereunder by any judge warden or clerk respectively may

315. If such owner or occupier fail to proceed for a
period of three months after it has become lawful to pro-
ceed as aforesaid, then all claim for compensation by such
owner or occupier shall except as hereinafter provided be
deemed to have been waived and abandoned. Provided
that when any claim for compensation is by the operation
of this section deemed to have been waived and abandoned
the Minister shall direct the warden of the district to
ascertain and fix the amount of compensation to be paid by
any person who desires a mining lease under this Part of
this Act of the land in respect of which such claim is
deemed to have been waived and abandoned, and for the
purpose of ascertaining and fixing the amount of such com-
pensation, the said warden shall have the same powers as
he has in other cases where the amount of compensation to
be paid is not ascertained by agreement. Such person shall
pay such amount to the Minister to be paid over to the
Treasurer of Victoria to be held by him in trust for the
owner or occupier, and thereupon a mining lease may be
granted in respect of such land and mining operations com-
menced notwithstanding anything contained in this Part.
316. All parties under disability to sell and convey who
are seised or possessed of or entitled to any private land or
any estate or interest therein may settle by agreement sub-
ject to the approval of the warden with any person desiring
to mine therein or thereon the amount of compensation to
be paid in respect of any such land estate or interest, and
may enter into all necessary agreements for that purpose,
and particularly any of the following parties so seised
possessed or entitled as aforesaid may so settle with the
applicant (that is to say) :—All corporations, tenants in
tail or for life, guardians, committees of lunatics and idiots,
trustees, or feoffees in trust for charitable or other pur-
poses, executors and administrators, and all parties for the
time being entitled to the receipts of the rents and profits
of any such land in possession or subject to any estate in
dower or to any lease for life or for lives and years or for
years or any less interest, and every valuation so settled as
aforesaid by all such parties other than lessees for life or
for lives and years or for years or for any less interest shall
be binding not only on themselves and their respective
neirs executors administrators and successors but also on


every person entitled in reversion remainder or expectancy
after them, or in defeasance of the estates of such parties,
and as to such guardians on their wards and as to such com-
mittees on the lunatics and idiots of whom they are the
committees respectively, and as to such trustees, executors
or administrators on their cestuique trusts whether infants
issue unborn, lunatics, femes covert or other persons.
317. The sections thirty-eight to forty-five both inclusive
of the Lands Compensation Act 1890 are hereby incorpor-
ated with and shall be read as part of this Part of this Act,
and in the construction of the same the words “of the
execution of the works ” shall be read and construed as
though the words “ of the carrying on of mining operations”
were substituted therefor, and the words “ this Act and
“ this Act or the special Act ” shall be read and construed
as though the words “Part 11. of the Mines Act 1890
were substituted therefor, and the words “ the board ” shall
be read and construed as though the words “ any person
desiring to mine therein or thereon ” were substituted
therefor.
318. The compensation to be ascertained under the pro-
visions of this Part of this Act shall include the several
matters and things which by this Part are made the sub-
jects of compensation.
319. Unless an agreement have been made between any
person applying for a mining lease under this Part of this
Act and the owner or occupier of any land to pay a per-
centage of gold taken from the mines under such land or
otherwise in lieu of compensation, or unless such person
have taken the whole of the land and paid the purchase
money thereof in respect of which such mining lease is
applied for, before any mining lease is granted to any such
person such person shall pay to the Minister the amount of
compensation and costs (if any) ascertained by agreement
or determined as payable in respect of any land of which
such person desires a mining lease, and the Minister shall
pay to the owner and occupier respectively the amount to
which each may be entitled.

and for cutting and constructing thereon races drains dams
reservoirs or tramways, and erecting any buildings and
machinery and generally for doing all such acts and things
as shall appear to be requisite for efficiently mining in or on
the said land , and such mining lease may be granted not-
withstanding that the person applying for the same may
not in all respects have complied with the said regulations.
321. No mining lease shall be granted under this Part of
this Act until after the expiration of one month from the
date of notification in the Government Gazette of intention
to grant the same and in some newspaper the place of
publication of which is near to the land sought to be

322. The term for which a mining lease may be granted
under this Part of this Act shall in the case of land mined
in or on under an agreement existing on the first day of
August One thousand eight hundred and eighty-four be for
the unexpired term of such agreement not exceeding eleven
years and in all other cases not exceeding fifteen years from
the time of granting the same, and the yearly rent to be
payable in respect thereof shall be at the rate of sixpence
for every acre demised. Provided that every mining lease
granted under the authority of this Part shall contain a
condition that if the lessee his executors administrators
and assigns fail at any time during the term to fulfil the
conditions and terms therein contained or to use the land
bond fide for the purposes for which it is demised, such
mining lease shall for any such failure be voidable at the
will of the Governor in Council.
323. In the case of every mining lease and lease under
“ The Mining on Private Property Act 1884” made or
issued previously to the eighteenth day of December One
thousand eight hundred and eighty-five by the Governor in
Council the rent reserved shall from and after the said date
be deemed to be at the rate of sixpence for every acre
demised; and every such mining lease and lease shall so
far only as regards any rent accruing due after the said
date be read as if rent at the rate of sixpence for every
acre had been thereby reserved in lieu of the rent therein


324. The rent reserved by or payable under any mining
[ease issued either before or after the passing of this Act
under “ The Mining on Private Act 1884,” or this
Part of this Act shall not be less than One pound per
annum except in cases in which a smaller sum was payable
before the passing of “ The Mining Rents Act 1887,” in
which cases such smaller sum shall continue to be payable.
325. Where the rent reserved by or payable under any
mining lease made or issued under '■'■The Mining on Private
Property Act 1884” by the Governor in Council before the
passing of “ The Mining Rents Act 1887” would but for
the provisions of section three of “ The Mining Act 1885 ”
have been less than the sum of Four pounds per annum,
such mining lease shall so far as regards any rent accruing
due after the passing of this Act be read as though this
and the last preceding section had been in force at the
time of the making or issuing of such lease.
326. The person beneficially interested and entitled
under any mining lease granted in pursuance of the pro-
visions of this Part of this Act to mine in or on the land
the subject of such lease shall if he make application before
the expiration of such mining lease be entitled to and it
shall be lawful for the Governor in Council to grant a
renewal of his mining lease for a term of fifteen years and
without payment of any compensation, other than compen-
sation to the owner or occupier for depriving him of the
possession of the surface of such land or any part thereof
and for any injury or damage which it may reasonably be
supposed will be done to the surface beyond that already
done and which has not been already compensated for
under any previous agreement; and if the amount of such

within one hundred yards of the same and belonging to
the owner of the same and a right of access to such land
have first been taken by the applicant which he is hereby
authorized to do and the amount of the purchase money
thereof ascertained in the same manner as compensation is
ascertained under the provisions of this Part. Provided
that nothing in this section contained shall be deemed to
forbid the issue of a mining lease in any case where the
applicant has authority from the owner of any private land
to enter thereon for the purpose of mining in or on the
same, and that no person shall be entitled to claim the
benefit of the provisions of this section for more than ten
acres of any land held by him as a garden orchard or vine-
yard.
328. If after any private land has been taken by an
applicant for a mining lease under the authority of this
Part of this Act and mining operations have not been com-
menced on the land comprised in such mining lease within
a period of one year from the date of the taking of such
private land or if mining operations have been commenced
on such private land but have wholly ceased for a period of
one year, then the same shall revert to and shall be recon-
veyed to the person who was the owner thereof at the time
the same was taken.
329. No mining lease shall be granted under this Part of
this Act of any mines under any land on which any hos-
pital asylum church or public building is situated or of any

in such case first obtained.
330. Where under section forty-two of “ The Amending
Land Act 1865” or section forty-nine of the u Land Act 1869”
any land is held under licence or lease from the Crown such
land shall (notwithstanding anything contained in section
two hundred and ninety-nine of this Act) for the purpose
of this Part of this Act be considered as Crown lands
within the meaning of Part I. of this Act.


331. Any person desirous of obtaining a mining lease of
any such lands may at all reasonable times and doing no
unnecessaxy damage enter upon any part of such lands
(not consisting of houses buildings yards gardens or stables)

Crown lands, and no such entry or marking out shall be or
be deemed an act of trespass on the part of such person
his servants or agents.

such lands or any portion thereof for mining purposes, and
all the provisions of the Part I. of this Act respecting the
granting of or otherwise dealing with mining leases shall
apply thereto.
333. The granting the application for such lease shall
not confer upon the lessee any right of entry upon such
lands for the purpose of mining or making preparations for
mining, nor shall any such lease be delivered to the lessee
until such compensation for surface damage as may have
been agreed upon between the licensee or the leaseholder
of the land and the applicant for the lease or as may have
been ascertained and determined in the manner hereinafter
provided has been paid or tendered to the licensee or lease-
holder of the land ; and in case the licensee or leaseholder
of the land and the applicant for a mining lease be unable
within one month after the application for a lease has been
made to agree upon the amount of compensation for sur-
face damage to be paid then the amount of compensation
to be paid for such surface damage shall be ascertained and
determined in the manner provided by section one hundred
and twenty-one of the Land Act 1890 for determining the
amount of compensation to be paid by persons entering
and mining upon lands under the provisions of sections one
hundred and nineteen and one hundred and twenty of the
said Act.
334. Every mining lease under this Part of this Act
may with the consent of the Governor in Council be trans-
ferred sub-leased mortgaged or otherwise dealt with by the
lessee, and every such mining lease may be with the con-
sent of the Governor in Council at any time surrendered.

Part of this Act or of a lease or claim held under Part I.
of this Act that water should be conveyed therefrom or
brought thereto from any river stream or other water-
course or from any water hole dam reservoir or place where
water is artificially stored if the person or persons requiring
such water be entitled to take the same, it shall be lawful
for the Governor in Council in the name and on behalf of
Her Majesty to enter upon so much of any private land as
may be required for the construction of a race or flume or
for the laying of pipes for the bringing of such water to or
from the said mine or claim and to grant to the person re-
quiring or using such water a lease of such private land as
may be required for such construction, and the rent for the
land comprised in any such lease shall be sixpence per acre
per annum. Every such lease shall be obtained and com-
pensation for the land comprised therein and for the in-
juriously affecting of any other land shall be ascertained
and paid as hereinbefore in this Part provided and shall be

right and the owner of any private land as hereinafter
provided the jurisdiction of the warden and of the Court
of Mines and every other jurisdiction established or con-
tinued by Part I. of this Act with respect to mining on
Crown lands shall apply to any private land comprised in
such mining lease or to land the subject of such agreement
as the case may be and to mining in any land in which
such mining is authorized by such mining lease or agree-
ment, and sections one hundred and five to one hundred
and eight both inclusive of the Crimes Act 1890 shall apply
to mining under this Part ; and the word “ claim ” in the
said sections one hundred and five one hundred and six
and one hundred and eight shall mean and include private
land in respect of which a mining lease has been granted
under this Part or land the subject of any such agreement
as aforesaid.

rity of this Part of this Act is or is liable to be forfeited
or declared void and determined by any breach of covenant


or conditions or otherwise, or in case the term thereby
granted has expired, possession of the mines demised shall
and may be recovered on behalf of Her Majesty in such
manner as may be provided by any of the conditions of
such raining lease; or if there be no such conditions it
shall be lawful for the Attorney-General on behalf of Her
Majesty to bring a suit in the Court of Mines in the dis-
trict in which the land comprised in such mining lease is
situated to recover possession of such land or the mines
thereunder, and such suit shall be commenced and carried
on as any other suit in the Court of Mines, and the pro-
ceedings therein shall be the same and the judgment therein
enforced in like manner as in the case ot‘ any other suit in
the said court.
338. If any mining lease on any private land be de-
clared void or forfeited for breach of any of the covenants
of the same, any person mining on such land as a tributer
or sub-tributer shall unless he have been the cause either
wholly or partly of such breach bo entitled to have a
mining lease issued to him for the remainder of the term of
the mining lease so declared void or forfeited. If after
mining operations have been commenced in or upon any
private land held under a mining lease granted under this
Part of this Act the same have wholly ceased without the
consent of the Governor in Council, it shall be lawful for
the Governor in Council on the application of the owner of
the land to authorize him to re-enter and take possession of
such land whereon mining operations have so wholly ceased
notwithstanding that such lease may not have expired.

poration having the care and management of any public
highway street or road or upon the application of any per-
son authorized by such corporation by writing under the
hand of the warden authorize any mining surveyor or
surveyors or some experienced miner or miners to enter
upon and inspect any land or mines comprised in any
mining lease under this Part of this Act and every part
thereof for the purpose of ascertaining whether the persons
working such mines are encroaching on any public highway
street or road, and whether the mining operations carried
on can be continued without causing injury or damage to
such public highway street or road or to any house or build-
ins abutting thereon or adjoining thereto.

sons as aforesaid) as the case may be and every person who
acts contrary to such declaration shall forfeit and pay any

363, If any mine wherein operations are carried on for
the working of any metalliferous or mineral lodes or
veins or any metalliferous or mineral deposits is con-
sidered by the Minister to be likely at any time to contain
dangerous accumulations of water, the Minister may by a
notice in writing addressed to the manager of such mine
order that an accurate plan and sections of the shafts drives
levels and all other underground woi kings of such mine
shall be made and a copy thereof deposited in the office of
the warden nearest to such mine ; and within three months

any injury in person or be killed owing to the non-obser-
vance in such mine of any of the provisions of this Division
of this Part of this Act, such non-observance not being solely
due to the negligence of the person so injured or killed, or
owing in any way to the negligence of the owner of such
mine his agents or servants, the person so injured or his per-
sonal representatives or the personal representatives of the
person so killed may recover from the owner compensation
by any of damages as for a tort committed by such owner;
and the amount of such compensation with the costs of re-
covering the same when determined shall constitute a charge
on the mine and mining plant in or about which such person
was so employed, and all charges arising under the provisions
of this section shall as between themselves be paid ratetably.
Provided that any warden or warden and assessors if re-
quired either by the warden the plaintiff or the defendant
shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine all claims for

any inspector, it shall be the duty of such inspector to make
inquiry into the matter of such complaint, and to take such
other steps as he may deem necessary to investigate the
matter, and the name of the informant shall not be divulged
by the inspector. No inspector under this Division of this
Part of this Act shall be allowed to hold any interest what-
ever in any mine in the district in which he is authorized by

ferous drift may require the owner of any mine the work-
ings of which have reached the natural water level drained
by such machinery to contribute a fair share of the total
expense of draining or drawing the water from the mines
drained by such machinery ; and in default of payment or
in case of disagreement respecting the amount of such
share the owner of such machinery may summon the
owner of any such mine before a warden, who may make an
order on such owner to pay such sum or sums periodically
or otherwise to the owner of such machinery as the warden
shall think just and reasonable.
The warden may upon making such order impose on the
owner of such machinery such terms with regard to the
efficient working thereof for the benefit of all parties as to
such warden shall seem just and order the same to be per-
formed, or may make such other order concerning the
premises as the justice and equity of the case may demand
and such orders from time to time may annul vary or alter.
Provided that if either party shall desire to have the sub-
ject matter of complaint heard before a warden and asses-
sors, the same shall be heard and determined before a
warden and four assessors who are to be chosen from the
warden’s roll as being practical working miners and an
order made accordingly, and such assessors shall be sum-
moned chosen and sworn in the manner prescribed by Part
I. of this Act.


The warden shall have all the powers and authorities in
relation to summoning parties and the witnesses the taking
of evidence and making and enforcing all such orders as
aforesaid as he now has in any case which he has jurlsdic-
diction to hear and determine under or by virtue of the
said Part I. and either party may apply to the warden to
reserve any question of law in the form of a special case
for the opinion of the Supreme Court, which opinion such
Supreme Court is to give, and in such case proceedings may
be stayed upon such terms as the warden shall think fat
until such opinion shall have been given, and all the provi-
sions of the said Part I. relating to the reserving by war-
dens of questions of law in the form of special cases tor
the opinion of the said Supreme Court and to the proceed-
ings therein or thereon shall apply to all questions of law
reserved or which parties may apply to have reserved in the
form of special cases under this section and to all proceed-
ings therein or thereon ; and all the forms and proceedings
to°be instituted under this Division of this Part of this
Act shall be as near as may be to those required under the
said Part I. as the different circumstances will admit.
379. The expense of the drainage effected by the owner
of any machinery shall be arrived at by calculating
(а) The interest on the value of machinery and plant
used for drainage purposes only :
(б) The wear and tear of such machinery and plant:
(c) The cost of oil grease and packing:
(cf) The proportionate cost of fuel expended or of
horses employed in drainage operations :
(e) The wages of engine-drivers and of other persons
in such proportions as such persons may be
deemed to be employed in draining a mine ; and
(/) Such other expenses as the owner can prove that
have necessarily been incurred in respect of the
drainage effected by any machinery.
380. No drainage dues shall be demanded for any period
during suspension of draining operations; and in deter-
mining the cost of drainage effected by the owner of any
machinery if the whole or any part of the water raised by
such machinery shall be used by the owner of such
machinery for mining purposes the value of such water shall
be ascertained and deducted from the general cost of such
drainage.

381. In determining the mines the owners of which shall
be liable to contribute towards the expense of the drainage
effected by the owner of any machinery regard shall be had
to the total length of reef or lode or the extent of lead or
auriferous deposit affected by the drainage operations of
such machinery and to the amount of the benefit derived by
the owners of mines from such operations, and the share to
be contributed in respect of each mine drained shall be pro-
portioned as nearly as may be to the length of such reef or
lode or the extent of such auriferous lead or deposit con-
tained within each such mine and to the amount of benefit
so derived.
382. The owners of each mine liable so to contribute
shall receive credit for the value of any work they shall
perform in assisting to drain, and such value shall be added
to the general cost of drainage.
383. Any order made by a warden in exercise of the
jurisdiction or powers conferred by this Division of this
Part of this Act shall be signed by the warden making the
same, and may be either written or printed in the form or
to the effect in the Thirty-sixth Schedule hereto, and shall
be valid and effectual without any recital or statements ne-
cessary to show jurisdiction; and no order of a warden
under this Division of this Part shall be set aside or de-
clared invalid in any court whatsoever for want of form.
384. Whenever any sum of money or portion of any sum
of money ordered to be paid in or by any decision or order
of a warden under this Division of this Part of this Act,
and whether such money was ordered to be paid at one time
or in periodical payments, shall remain unsatisfied in whole
or in part, and whether after previous executions or not,
for fourteen days or for a longer period, the warden who shall
have made such order or any other warden to whom a
certified copy of the said order shall be produced shall on
the application of the owner of machinery claiming to be
entitled to the moneys in such order or any attorney in his
behalf grant to the party so applying a certificate in the
form in the Thirty-seventh Schedule to this Act or to the
like effect: and it shall be lawful for the party obtaining
such certificate or his attorney to file such certificate with
the clerk of the Court of the Mines of the district in which
such order shall have been made, and thereupon execution
may issue and all such proceedings be had and taken to en-
force payment of the moneys mentioned in such order as


upon a decree or order of the court to the clerk of which
such certificate shall be directed. And in the event of any
such decision or order of the warden imposing upon the
owner of machinery any terms with regard to the efficient
working of the machinery or otherwise, such terms may be
enforced in the same manner as orders by a warden other
than or besides orders for the payment of money may be
enforced under Part I. of this Act; and it shall be lawful
for the warden to suspend the enforcement of so much of
the order as directs the payment of money to the owner of
machinery until the terms in such order imposed upon such
owner of machinery have been carried out by him.
385. Whenever and so soon as any order of a warden
made under this Division of this Part of this Act shall have
been filed with the clerk of the Court of Mines, the moneys
directed in such order to be paid shall so long as any part
thereof remains unpaid and unsatisfied become and be a
charge subject to prior encumbrances upon the estate or
interest of the owner of the mine in the Crown land or
private lands occupied or used for mining purposes by the
owner of the mine in respect of which the money men-
tioned in such order is directed to be paid and upon all
plant and machinery thereon and all property of the owner
of the mine in such land plant and machinery ; and the
warden by whom such order shall have been made or any
other warden to whom a certified copy of such order shall
be produced may by his order restrain the sale or other dis-
posal or transfer of such interest in the land plant
machinery or property until such moneys have been paid ;
but this provision shall not be deemed in any way to lessen
the right of seizure and sale of such land plant machinery
and property under any execution issued for the realisation
of the moneys ordered in such warden’s order to be paid or
contributed.
386. The remedies provided in the three last preceding
sections shall be taken to be cumulative and ancillary to
the remedies given in or by any other section in this
Division of this Part of this Act and shall not be construed
to in any way lessen or take away any of the jurisdiction
power or remedies created or given in or by such last-
mentioned sections.

two and for the grant of pensions and other allowances to
the widows and orphan children of such persons as lost
their lives by the said accident, and after the satisfaction
of such pensions and other allowances then for the relief of
sufferers from subsequent accidents in mines in Victoria :
And whereas it was deemed expedient that trustees should
be appointed and provision made for enforcing the con-
ditions on which such moneys had been allotted and also
for disposing of any surplus or other moneys which might
be thereafter from time to time voted by Parliament or
subscribed by the public and for relieving the sufferers by
any accident which had occurred or might thereafter occur
in any mine in Victoria ; Be it therefore enacted as follows
(that is to say) :

from the time aforesaid perpetual succession and a common
seal and shall be and shall be deemed to have been from
the time aforesaid capable in law of suing and of being
sued, and shall subject to the provisions of the said Act
and of this Division of this Part of this Act have and be
deemed to have had from the time aforesaid power to pur-
chase take and hold lands tenements and hereditaments for
the purpose of any mortgage or for the purpose of pro-
viding offices for the conduct of their business and to sell
and convey any such lands tenements and hereditaments.
388. Anything by this Division of this Part of this Act
authorized to be done by the trustees may be done by any
three of such trustees at any meeting of the trustees duly
convened by the Mayor of Melbourne on the requisition of
any two trustees by a notice addressed to the public office


of each trustee and posted four days before such meeting.
The Mayor of Melbourne shall be chairman of the trustees
and shall if present preside at their meetings, and if he be
not present at any such meeting then such other trustee as
the trustees present at such meeting shall choose shall
preside thereat. The trustee presiding at any meeting of
the trustees shall in the event of an equal division of votes
at such meeting have a second or casting vote. The trus-
tees may from time to time appoint a secretary and sue i
other officers and employes as they think fit and may remove
any persons so appointed, and they may pay such secretary
officers and employes such salaries and remuneration as
they think fit.
389. All moneys raised by public subscription for the
relief of the sufferers by the” accident which occurred in
the New Australasian mine at Oreswick in the month of

the “ Fund.”
All subscriptions donations grants and bequests to the
Fund and all other moneys whatsoever heretofore or
from time to time hereafter received by the trustees in
in virtue of their office as such trustees shall be deemed
from the date of their receipt to have formed and shall
form respectively part of the Fund, and all such subscrip-
tions donations grants and bequests unless specially directed
by the donors thereof to be otherwise applied shall be
deemed to have formed and shall form respectively part ot

(b) Whether it is cultivated or not, and whether any improve-
ments have been effected thereon.
(c) Whether it is intersected by auriferous or argentiferous
veins, or contains alluviums; and if it contains alluviums,

behalf of the Crown Lands Department, a copy of the plan of such


Thirty-third Schedule— continued.
allotment shall be made without any further survey. When a lease
is applied for by the owner or occupier under any agreement, the
warden shall under this rule only authorize the mining surveyor to
make a survey and plan of the land, and to report on the matters
mentioned in sub-sections (/) and (g) of this regulation.

on a conspicuous place on the land, and also on his own office, and
at the post office or police court nearest to the land, a notice in the
form set out in Appendix H hereto.
Objections.
10. Any person objecting to the granting of a lease for which
application has been made shall, within the time appointed by the
notice H, lodge with the warden and leave for the applicant, or if

grounds of his objections, and in such statement shall specify
whether it is proposed to take action in reference to the objections
in the Court of Mines or before the warden. No particular form of
objection shall be necessary, so that it clearly appears whose appli-
cation is objected to, and the grounds thereof, and the address of
the objector, which shall be his address for all the purposes of these
regulations.
11. Within four days after the expiration of the seven days for
lodging objections whether any objection have been lodged or not,
the warden shall give to the applicant and objectors (if any) two
clear days’ notice of the court to be holden to inquire into such

of the applicant and objectors with reference to such ob-
jections, and all matters and things connected therewith,
and mark in the usual way all documentary evidence pro-
duced, and shall take possession thereof, or of a certified
copy thereof. After the applicant and objectors have
concluded the evidence aforesaid, the warden shall then

court was held a notice to the effect that the court in the matter of
such application is closed.
17. In case the Minister is of opinion that the particulars trans-
mitted to him are not sufficient, he may take all or any of the fol-
lowing courses, one before the other, or in any order, and as often
as he thinks fit, before the court is closed, as hereinafter directed:—
(a) State to the warden on what subjects the particulars afore-
said or anything connected therewith are not sufficient, and

the application :

matters and things connected therewith ; such matters and
things to be specified in the direction to hold the court.

mentioned direction, and as often as such direction is received, give
the same notices of an adjourned court as hereinbefore required for
the first court, and in addition thereto he shall notify to the appli-
cant and the objectors (if any, whom it may in his opinion concern)
the matters and things respecting which such adjourned court is to
be held.
19. At and after such adjourned court, and every adjourned court
directed by the Minister, the duties of the warden shall be the same
as at and after the first court, except that the matters and things
for inquiry at each adjourned court respectively shall be the matters
and things specified in the direction of the VI inister to hold each
adjourned court.
20. After every such adjourned court, and within three days
thereof, the applicant and objectors (if any) shall be entitled to take

themselves, and may be heard by his or their counsel or agents ; but

into thereat.

spective parties thereto, shall be forwarded to the Minister.
25. As soon as the amount of compensation agreed upon or deter-
mined on has been paid to the Minister or to the owner or occupier,
leases shall be granted according to priority of application, subject
to the provisions of Part II of the Mines Act 1890, and the priority

shall be included in such lease and to define the same accordingly,
and also to alter as he sees fit any of the other terms proposed in the
application.
27- If the Governor in Council refuse to grant a lease, the appli-
cation shall be deemed to be abandoned, and such abandonment

ing in the Gazette as provided in that event by these regulations.

to such of them who shall execute the lease as the warden thinks
fit.
31. The applicant shall execute the lease within twenty-one days
after the receipt from the warden of the above-mentioned notifica-

32. The lease to be issued by the Governor in Council to the appli-
cant shall be in the form and to the effect and shall contain the reser-

and thereupon the secretary shall publish in the Government Gazette
notice to the effect that the application under Part 11. of the
Mines Act 1890 of [ naming him ] , dated
day of 18 , for a lease of the land [describing
it as in the application] was abandoned, or the lease executed by the
Governor in Council, dated the day of
18 , between Her Majesty the Queen and [the applicant]
of the land [describing it as in the lease] is void, as the case may be ;
and such notice in the Gazette shall be conclusive evidence in all
courts of law and other judicature of such declaration having been
made, and that such application was abandoned or such lease void

tions shall be returned by the warden to the person or persons from
whose custody the same were produced and delivered to him, and
for that purpose the warden shall enter into a book to be kept by

PART 11. OF THE MINES ACT 1890,
Appendix B.— (Rule 4.)
The fees authorized to be charged by mining surveyors for surveys
made by them under these regulations shall not exceed those speci-
fied in the following scale, except in the mining district of Gipps-
land and certain subdivisions of the mining district of Beechworth;—
£ s. d.
Surveying boundaries of any block under 20 acres ... 3 3 0
Ditto, 20 acres and under 40 acres ... 4 4 0
Ditto, 40 acres and upwards, at per mile of boundaries 3 10 0
Interior lines to fix the position of objects within the
block, at per mile ... ... ... ... ... 2 10 0
Connection to nearest fixed point, at per mile .. 2 10 0
Travelling expenses to the block to be surveyed, for
any distance after the first three miles from the
mining surveyor’s office, at per mile one way ... 0 4 0
Note. — The above fees in all cases shall include the making and
furnishing of plans and reports, but shall be exclusive of the ex-
pense of the cost of providing and fixing posts.
When copies are furnished of any plans of allotments surveyed
on behalf of the Crown Lands department, the surveyor will be
allowed to charge only such reasonable fees as the Chief Mining
Surveyor approves.
If two or more surveys are made on the same day, in the same
locality, only one charge will be allowed for the actual distance
travelled one way beyond the first three miles from the surveyor’s
office, such charge to be proportionately divided among the appli-
cants for survey.
For the survey of blocks where the existence of thick scrub may
cause undue loss of time and expense in clearing the lines, the sur-
veyor will be allowed to charge such amount to meet the extra cost
incurred by him as may be considered reasonable and just by the
Chief Mining Surveyor, in addition to the prescribed scale of fees.

tion shall be determined according to the time at which
each application shall have been received, as endorsed on
the applications ; and in case of two or more applications

reasonably requires for the proper working of the land
applied for. He shall also report to the warden whether
any and what further deposit shall be paid by the applicant
to the warden in respect of such marking out by red posts
and survey ; such estimate will be subject to the revision of
the chief mining surveyor.
12. Immediately after such survey is completed, the
surveyor shall post on a conspicuous place on the land and

day’s notice shall be given to the applicant and claimant.
Notice of any such agreement shall be given by the claim-
ant to the warden, and in case he shall not give such
notice he shall not be entitled to the benefit of clause 42.
41. The warden shall, at the time and place (whether or
not the applicant and claimant or one or neither of them
attend), proceed to inquire into the matter of the claim ;
and shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, make his award
in respect of such claimants as shall appear to him to be
entitled to compensation. Such award shall be in the form
marked Lin the schedule hereto, and shall be delivered by
him to the claimant. If the warden shall be of opinion
that the claimant is not entitled to compensation, he shall
post a notice to that effect on some conspicuous part of his
court.
42. The warden shall not allow the applicant, and the
applicant shall not be entitled to execute the lease as pro-
vided by these Regulations unless and until the warden has
been satisfied that the applicant has paid, or satisfied, or
tendered the compensations agreed or awarded (as the case
may be) to be paid to such claimants as shall occupy the
land, or any part thereof, contained in the proposed lease.


As to the Deposits.
43. The applicant’s deposit shall be subject to any orders
which the Minister of Mines or the warden may at any
time or from time to time after the same is deposited make
for the payment thereout of any costs to the Crown, the
objectors, or any other person ; and the clerk with whom
the same is deposited shall pay thereout such sums as shall
by written order be directed to the persons named in any
such order; and if any balance remains, the same or, if no
costs are so ordered to be paid thereout, the whole thereof
shall, unless the Minister shall otherwise direct, be paid to
the applicant or, if more than one, to such one or more of
them as shall apply to the warden for the same after the
execution of the lease or after the notice of the refusal or
abandonment of the application appearing in the Govern-
ment Gazette as by these Regulations directed, but not before.
The whole deposit or any balance remaining after the pay-
ment of expenses shall be liable to be forfeited and paid
into the revenue if the application is abandoned by the
applicant, or if the lease applied for is refused because the
applicant has applied for land lawfully held by other per-
ons who have not consented to the issue of a lease, or if
the applicant refuses or neglects to execute the lease within
the time specified in these Regulations.
44. The deposit of Five pounds made by the objector
shall in like manner be subject to the orders of the Minister
of Mines or of the warden for the payment of any costs
thereout, either to the Crown, the applicant, or any other
person, to be made at any time after the same is deposited
and before the expiration of thirty days from the court
being closed, as by these Regulations provided ; and the
balance (if any) or the whole thereof (if no costs ordered
to be paid thereout within the time aforesaid) shall, upon
application to the warden, be returned to the objector who
deposited the same.
Miscellaneous Rules.
45. Upon receiving from the warden any application for
a reserved lands mining lease, the Minister shall, if he
think fit, cause the same and the documents accompanying
it to be submitted to the Governor in Council and the
Board of Land and Works, or to the Victorian Railways
Commissioners if such land be vested in such Com-
missioners, who shall determine —

Whether to grant such application subject to any and
what covenants, clauses, stipulations, restrictions,
and conditions, or whether to refuse such applica-
tion, and to determine what sum of money (if
any) ought to be paid by the applicant as com-
pensation for damage to the lands on which the
mines are situate, and what security (if any) shall
be given by the applicant to make good any
damage that may result from his mining beyond
that for which such sum to be paid as aforesaid
shall be a sufficient compensation.
46. Whenever the Governor in Council shall order a
lease to issue under these Regulations, the Minister shall
cause such lease to be prepared and submitted to the Board
of Land and Works, or to the Victorian Railways Com-
missioners if such land be vested in such Commissioners,
for their approval; and no lease shall be executed by any
applicant until such approval has been obtained.
47. Any applicant may at any time withdraw his appli-
cation by giving notice to the warden that he so with-
draws, and thereupon the application shall be deemed to be
abandoned.
48. If any party or parties in whom the legal interest in
the term granted by the lease as issued by the Governor
shall for the time being be vested shall be desirous of
working and winning additional metals or minerals than
those specified in the lease, and which may be found in the
land comprised in such lease, he or they shall apply to the
Minister of Mines, through the warden, for a licence so to
do; and if granted, such licence shall be at the rents and
royalties thereby specified, and in the form set out in
Schedule P hereto, or with such modifications and additions
as the Minister of Mines shall think fit.
49. If the applicant is out of the colony he may comply
with these Regulations or any part of them by his attorney;
and if by attorney such attorney shall be constituted by
the execution of a power of attorney for that purpose in
the form or to the effect set out in Schedule M hereto
annexed, or in such other form as shall in the opinion of
the Minister of Mines be sufficient for the purpose; and
such attorney shall be bound to comply with these Regula-
tions in all respects as the applicant would have been if
personally present. Such power shall be filed as hereinafter
provided, and a certified copy thereof, together with the


Registrar-General’s receipt for the original power of at-1
torney, shall be left with the warden.
50. Any person or persons being the lawful holder or
holders of the lease granted by the Governor, except any
person or persons who by operation of law shall be entitled
to sell or dispose of such lease for the benefit of creditors
or a creditor, in which case no licence shall be necessary,
shall (if desirous of so doing) apply to the Minister of
Mines for a licence, under the hand and seal of the Go-
vernor, to transfer, underlet, mortgage, or otherwise dispose
of or encumber such lease, or the premises comprised
therein, or any part or parts thereof; and it shall be lawful
for the Governor to grant or refuse such application.
Every such application must be accompanied with a remit-
tance of One pound, which will be returned if the applica-
tion be refused. Unless the person or persons so applying
is or are the legal holder or holders of the lease, such
licence, if granted, shall have no effect. Such licence if
granted shall be in the form set out in Schedule N hereto
annexed, or as near thereto as practicable.
51. These Regulations are subject to the special powers
vested in the Governor in Council by the 79th section of
The Mines Act 1890 on the occasion of granting any par-
ticular lease.
Registration op Lease.
52. The lease, and every transfer, sub-lease, mortgage,
or encumbrance thereof, or any part or parts of the pre-
mises comprised therein, shall be registered, and every
power of attorney authorized by clause 49 shall be filed in
manner provided by law for the registration and filing of
similar instruments in the colony ; and the fees to be paid
on such registration and filing, and the duties of persons
conducting the same, shall be the same as in ordinary cases
of a similar nature.

shall commit a breach of any of the covenants of such
lease, it shall be lawful for the holder or holders of a
miner’s right or rights to apply to the Minister of Mines in
the form set out in Schedule O hereto ; and if such appli-
cation shall be made, and the person or persons so applying
shall lodge with the clerk of the warden the sum of Five
pounds sterling for costs, the Minister of Mines may if
he think tit refer the said application to the warden, with
directions to hold a public inquiry concerning the alleged
breach.
54. The warden shall give such notice to the parties as
he shall think necessary, and on failure of either party to
attend him he may proceed ex parte; and cn such inquiry
shall hear and examine the parties and their witnessess, and
shall reduce their evidence to writing and shall forward the
same together with a Report thereon to the Minister of
Mines ; and on any such hearing the warden may allow, in
his discretion, to the lessees or lessee, their, his, or its suc-
cessors, executors, administrators, or transferrees, costs not
exceeding Five pounds, to be taken out of the deposit made
by the person or persons so applying as aforesaid.
55. If the Minister of Mines, after perusing such report,
shall be of opinion that any breach of any of the covenants
or conditions of the lease has been committed, and that the
lease should be forfeited, he shall submit the matter for the
judgment and determination of the Governor in Council.
56. If the Governor in Council shall declare the lease to
be void, it shall be lawful for the Governor, in the name
and on behalf of Her Majesty, but subject to Section 69 of
the Mines Act 1890, to grant to the person or persons so
applying a lease of the whole or any portion of the land
held under the determined lease, for such term, not exceed-
ing fifteen years, as the Governor shall think fit.

that the lease has been declared void, remove any plant,
machinery, engines, or tools on the land so held under the
determined lease, but not timber used in and for supporting
the shafts, drives, galleries, or adits in the mine.


58. When any application under Clause 53 of the said
Regulations has been referred to the warden, the warden
shall also inquire respecting the value to the holder or
holders of a miner’s right or rights making such application
for any work or labour then done on, or within, or beneath
the leased land and premises which, in the warden’s opinion,
is available for or necessary to any future mining operations ;
and in case the lease shall be forfeited and declared void,
the said holder or holders of a miner’s right or rights making
the said application under Clause 53 of the said Regulations
shall not receive a lease of the land applied for until he or
they shall have deposited with the warden for payment to
the person or persons entitled to the former lease the
amount found by the warden as the value of the said work
and labour : Provided that no sum shall be allowed or
paid for any such work or labour in any case where it is
proved to the satisfaction of the warden that the lessee or
lessees, his or their executors, administrators, or transferrees,
have neglected to fulfil the covenants of the lease for a
period of twelve months previous to the said application
having been made by the holder or holders of a miner’s
right or rights.
59. If any applicant shall make default in proceeding in
accordance with these Regulations, the Minister may, by an
order under his hand, declare the application abandoned,
and cause to be published in the Government Gazette a
notice to that effect, and after the publication of any such
notice such applicant shall not be entitled to proceed with
his application: Provided that, in any case where an
applicant appears at an inquiry by an agent or gives
sufficient reasons in writing on or before the day on which
the inquiry is to be holdon why he cannot appear, his appli-
cation shall be proceeded with at such times and places as
the warden may think fit.
60. These Regulations shall come into force at the end
of twenty-one days after the same shall have been published
in the Government Gazette ; but they shall not apply to or
in any way affect any application for a lease made and not
determined at the time of the coming into operation of
these Regulations, but such application may be carried on
and determined as if these Regulations had not been
made.
