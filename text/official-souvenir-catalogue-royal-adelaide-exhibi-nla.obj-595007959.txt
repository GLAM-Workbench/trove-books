HOUSEWORK nows SMOOTHLY when
you have gas to help you. Gas will cook
the dinner for you when you’re
not even in the house. It will keep water hot
for you... automatically... you never have
to give it a thought... just use it for
the dozens of daily jobs. And silent,
dependable gas refrigeration will keep your food
sound and wholesome so that you’ve never
a worry about catering.

YOUR LAUNDRY must be cool in summer and tidy

likely to settle in your clean wash, won’t help you.
A gas copper banishes all mess, has the clothes boiling
in half the time, and makes a sparkling white wash a certainty.
i.ff-
IN THE BATHROOM there are
hot baths and showers for everyone when gas heats the water.
Gas bath heaters give streams of hot water instantly and without waste.
All at just the right temperature, too, because gas heat

The Royal Adelaide Exhibition is the sixteenth Exhibition sponsored by the South Aus-
tralian Chamber of Manufactures, and it is not without interest to glance briefly at the history
of these Exhibitions and note the tremendous increase in their size and scope since the initial
undertaking in 1875. ■ ’
It has always been the' Chamber's object that its Exhibitions should reflect the ever-
growing industrial activity of the State, and Since 1920, when the first All-Australian Exhibi-
tion was held, of Australia as a whole. The past eleven years since the last Exhibition was
held has seen an amazing increase in secondary industries, particularly in South Australia,
and in the variety of their products. , A comparison between the articles displayed at this
Exhibition and those at the Centennial Exhibition gives some indication of the progress which
has been made.
The 1875 Exhibition was held in what was known as the Exchange Room of the Adelaide
Town Hall, and its stated object was to enable "mechanics, apprentices and others to com-
pete together with specimens of their inventive genius and mechanical skill." Although,
naturally, only a small affair, it was considered highly successful and was followed by
three similar events in 1876, 1877 and 1880.
The Grand Industrial Exhibition which was held in 1884 at the old Exhibition Building,
Frome Road, for the first time included some working exhibiis. This resulted in the very
successful attendance figure of 30,994
In 1887 the Chamber associated itself with the movement which brought about the Jubi-
lee Interational Exhibition, and its Secretary was appointed Organising Secretary of that
Exhibition.
Progressively successful Exhibitions of South Australian products were held by the
Chamber in the Jubilee Exhibition Buildings in 1891, 1895, 1900, 1905 and 1910. The Exhibi-
tion of 1910 was the first to be organised by the present General Secretary of the Chamber,
Mr. H. E. Winterbottom, and the Royal Adelaide Exhibition is thus the sixth which he has
organised.

ADELAIDE
1901 . 1947


Arrangements were being made to hold an Exhibition in 1915, but these were abandoned
with the outbreak of war in 1914, and it was not until 1920 that another Exhibition was held
—the All-Australian Peace Exhibition. This was the first of the Chamber's Exhibitions to be
all-Australian in character and it proved a tremendous success.
The Exhibitions of 1925 and 1930 were increasingly successful affairs, and these three
Exhibitions placed Adelaide undoubtedly in the lead of all other cities in Australia so far
as Exhibition organisation is concerned.
When the time came for preliminary discussions regarding the holding of an Exhibition
in 1935, it looked very much as though future Exhibitions by the Chamber would have to be
■abandoned owing to lack of satisfactory accommodation. The Jubilee Exhibition Buildings
and grounds had been handed over by the Government to the University to meet its expansion
needs and the Showgrounds at Wayville, whilst ideal for Show purposes, could not give the
•accommodation which an Exhibition required.
Fortunately, however, the centenary of the State in 1936 gave an opportunity for the
erection of a large hall, which, amongst other things, would be suitable for an Exhibition,
•and the Centennial Hall was accordingly erected, as the result of an Agreement between the
Government, the Royal Agricultural Society and the Chamber. This, together with certain
other buildings on the Showgrounds, should provide adequate accommodation for future
Exhibitions by the Chamber for many years to come.
Mainly at the request of the Government, therefore, the Chamber postponed its Exhibition
until 1936, so that it should form part of the Centennial celebrations, and as a centenary gesture
■agreed to widen the scope of the Exhibition so as to admit any Empire products.
The Centennial Exhibition thus proved to to be far and away the most ambitious venture
undertaken by the Chamber. There were Exhibits from almost all countries of the Empire,
and the range and variety of products of Australian, and particularly South Australian,
manufacture was truly remarkable. During its eight weeks' run, 720,000 people visited the
Exhibition.
It had originally been intended to hold the Royal Adelaide Exhibition in 1940 and plans
were well under way when war broke out, so, for a second time and for the same reason,
the Chamber had to abandon an Exhibition project. The war years saw a tremendous in-
crease of secondary industries in Australia, and the Council of the Chamber considered that
the first practical opportunity should be taken, by means of an Exhibition, of giving the public
•at least some idea of the range of lines now produced as the result of the resourcefulness
of Australian industry and the skill and ingenuity of Australian workmen. At the same time,
it was realised that, in organising such a project in the immediate post-war years, the ab-
normal conditions prevailing would create many problems, but after mature consideration, it
was felt that the beneficial results to be expected from the Exhibition made it more than
worthwhile to proceed with the arrangements.
That this decision was more than justified is shown by the truly wonderful support
which the proposal received from the manufacturers, and the result is to be seen in the
numerous fine displays which comprise the Royal Adelaide Exhibition.
Special Prizes.
A great number of very generous contributions towards the Prize Fund has been re-
ceived by the Council. These are either in the form of contributions to the general fund
or for special purposes stipulated by the donors. Details of these donations are published
later in this catalogue.

Exhibits.
The Exhibition comprises the following Sections:—
Section A—Trade displays by manufacturers, producers, Government and constituted autho-
rities.
Section B—Special concessions (sideshows and selling exhibits).
Section C—lndividual effort (exhibits of the individual work of artists, artisans and amateur
craftsmen).
Section D—Technical Schools (exhibits of the work of bona fide students of Technical
Schools).
Section E—Ex-Service Trainees (exhibits of the work of trainees in Government Schools
under the Commonwealth Reconstruction Training Scheme).
Section F—Trade competitions (trials of skill by apprentices and others).
Section G—Musical competitions.
The Exhibition is all-Australian in character, but the Council has permitted the admission
of token exhibits from Great Britain.
Awards.
In Section A prizes will be awarded for meritorious displays, but no awards will be made
for the quality of the goods exhibited. In other Sections awards will be made for individual
exhibits or performances under the respective classification schedules..
The apportionment of prizes will be made by the Council through the judges appointed
by them. Stewards will also be appointed to superintend the judging. No exhibitor will
be eligible for appointment as judge or steward in connection with any exhibit in which he
is interested.
In making their wards, the judges will consider originality, invention, discovery, utility,
quality, skill, workmanship, adaptation to public wants and economy, and will assess the
value of the prizes awarded on the following basis:—
1. Certificate of merit to be awarded to articles or exhibits considered of average merit.
2. Bronze medal for articles or exhibits showing more than average merit.
3. Silver medal for articles or exhibits of exceptional merit.
4. Gold medal for articles or exhibits of the highest order of workmanship as judged by
world standards.
Amusements.
Very complete arrangements have been made by the Council for entertaining the public.
In addition to the many attractions which the Exhibition itself provides, there will be held
in the Centennial Hall every afternoon and evening Musical Entertainments, Concerts, Musi-
cal Competitions and Trade Competitions. The north-western section of the grounds has been
set aside exclusively for use as an Amusement or Carnival Park.
Admission.
The Exhibition is open for two sessions per day, with the exception of Sundays, from
12 noon to 5 p.m. and from 7 p.m. to 10p.m. The ordinary charge for admission is 1/- per
head, children, 6d. The Council reserves the right to increase the charge for admission on
special occasions.

The power to progress is the great
distinctive attribute which separates
mankind from the lower orders.
Nature bestows on us the innate
desire for better things in order that,
by our striving, we may help along
her great scheme of evolution.
In the development of the commer-
cial world towards the ideal state
of perfect service, only the fittest
units, the progressive businesses,
ultimately survive. Our present
position, the result of our onward
march during many years, is but a
land-mark on the road; already
the torch of Progress shows new
ground ahead and we are pre-

Proved reliability, and outstanding
economy (fuel costs per mile are
one-fifth that of an ordinary petrol
engine) —are two of the reasons
why Gardner Diesels are replacing
petrol engines everywhere.
The Birmingham Corporation
which operates a fleet of more
than 800 Gardner engined buses
reports that several engines have
each covered over half a million
miles, having worn out two chassis,
and are now operating in their
third. Many Australian users re-
port similar performances.
Gardner engines are available
NOW to replace the petrol unit in
any heavy duty transport vehicle.
Gardner engines can be hand
started at all times if required,
and there is a complete range of
Stationary, Transport and Marine
Models; 3,4, 5, 6 or 8 cylinders;
B.H.P's. ranging from 26 to 152.
Engines and Equipment
Rasch Motors Pty., Ltd., The Engine
Specialists, invite you to make known
your requirements and receive fullest

MULBERRY HARBOUR MODEL
As the result of representations made by the Agent-General and Trade Commissioner
for South Australia, Sir Charles McCann, the British Government agreed to make available
for exhibition at the Royal Adelaide Exhibition a Model of the Mulberry Invasion Harbour.
This Model is staged in the South Eastern corner of the Centennial Hall. Mulberry
was the code name given to the artificial Port which was prefabricated in England and tow-
ed across to the French coast immediately after"'D" Day. It was roughly the size of Dover
and, in all, twenty-five large British Civil Engineering Companies were engaged in its con-
struction using about 600,000 tons of concrete and 75,000 tons of steel.
The site of the harbour was the small village of Arromanches on the coast of Normandy,
about midway between Havre and Cherbourg, and about 120 miles by sea from South-
hampton.
The harbour area enclosed by the breakwater is about 2L miles long by li miles wide;
the depth of water varies from 0 ft. at the shore to approximately 30 ft. at the breakwater at
low tide. The tidal range along this length of coast is about 24 ft.
The Breakwater.
The initial breakwater was formed of 17 sunken ships which steamed over the Channel
under their own power, and were sunk to provide some protection from heavy seas for the
smaller beaching craft carrying the early assault forces.
This initial breakwater was then extended and strengthened by the addition of 94 con-
crete caissons ("Phoenix"). The final completed length of breakwater was about 4 miles.
Two gaps are provided in the otherwise continuous length, for access of shipping.
Large vessels were moored in deep water at the western end of the harbour and dis-
charged their cargoes to barges and Dukws, which conveyed these stores direct to the beach-
es, or in" the case of the Dukws direct to the store dumps behind the village.
"Phoenix" Caissons.
These caissons are built of reinforced concrete, being divided into 22 cells on the prin-
ciple of an egg box.
The largest units were 204 ft. long x 60 ft. wide x 60 ft. deep, and weighed about 7,400
tons. Units of various sizes were built to suit the depth of water in which they were to be
sunk, the smallest weighing about 1,700 tons.
Construction was carried out in Dry Docks, Wet Basins (which were dried out), Entrance
Locks, floating docks and slipways at sites all along the coasts of Great Britain.

As each unit was completed, it was floated or launched and towed to various parking
sites on the south coast, where it was sunk to the sea bed. Then on "D" Day they were all
refloated and towed over the Channel to the harbour site, to be finally sunk in their pre-
selected positions.
Flooding valves are incorporated in the external walls, and these can be opened to ad-
mit water to sink the unit. The unit is refloated by closing these valves and pumping out
the water.
Stores Pierhead.
The Stores Pierhead with its two approach bridges for on and off traffic, was used for
the berthing of coasters and smaller craft. The total berthing length was about three-
eigths of a mile, and it was composed of eight spud pierheads together with pontoon plat-
forms, all linked by bridges to form a continuous pier.
The spud pierhead consisted of a floating platform 200 ft. long x 60 ft. wide, attached by
guides to four legs. These legs are lowered to the sea bed to form anchors, and the whole
pierhead then stands on the sea bottom like a table.
In calm weather when no berthing shocks have to be resisted, the pontoon is allowed
to float freely up and down the legs with the rise and fall of the tide, but when anchorage is
required to resist berthing or wave shocks, the pontoon is lifted slightly off iloatation by
means of winches, thus giving additional downward load on the legs and holding them firmly
on the sea bed.
The whole of the unit was towed over the Channel with the legs in the raised position.
The Intermediate Pontoon platforms situated between the pierheads are merely steel or
concrete pontoons moored to the spud pierheads to extend the deck length.
L.S.T. Pierhead.
The L.S.T. Pierhead consists of two spud pierheads, from one of which project two buffer
pontoons. The buffer pontoons are attached to the cross pierhead by hinges, about which
they pivot while floating.
The vessel to be berthed slides up the buffer in the same way as she would slide up a
beach.
The purpose of this pierhead is to provide berthing accommodation lor L.S.Ts (Landing
Ship Tank), which approach the buffer at a rate of about 3 knots, running their bows up the
buffer pontoon and lying alongside the spud pierhead. The bow doors of the craft can then
be opened in the dry and tanks, etc. can be run straight from the ship's hold on to the pier-
head. At the same time the deck cargo of lorries can be discharged on to the deck of the
pierhead by means of the timber ramp platform situated alongside the pierhead.
In this way the whole vessel can discharge 18 heavy tanks and 24 heavy lorries in a
matter of 15-20 minutes.
By depressing the buffer pontoon by flooding, the ship is allowed to slide backwards off
the buffer, and thus make way lor the following vessel.
Access to this pierhead is gained by the Floating Roadways.

Floating Roadways.
The floating roadway is a semi-rigid bridge structure consisting of a series of 80 ft. long
flexible steel bridge spans supported on pontoon floats.
This floating structure provides a 10 ft. roadway to carry loads up to 40-ton tanks.
The whole bridge is designed to behave like a long flexible chain which yields to the
movement of the sea. To allow for the extension and contraction in length due to the sea's
movement, a telescopic bridge span is introduced in each 500 ft. length of bridge.
The bridge was towed over the Channel in 500 ft. complete lengths, which were linked
togther at the site, providing a total length of about 2f miles of roadway. The maximum
length of one roadway was about f mile.
Pontoon Floats for Floating Roadway.
These pontoon floats were termed "beetles".
Some were built of steel plating and others of pre-cast concrete slabs.
Special precautions had to be taken at the shore end of the roadway to avoid damage
to the beetles, which with the receding tide would ground on the beach with rock outcrops.
Spud legs, generally similar to the pierhead legs, were provided on the shore floats.
The shore span was then positioned at high tide, the spud legs lowered to a solid bearing,
and when the tide fell the beetle was left standing 4-5 ft. above the beach, supported on its
four legs.
The rocky surface was then cushioned with sandbags, and on the following high tide
the legs could be removed, thus allowing the pontoon to setle on to the cushioned surface
with the subsequent low tide.
These beetles require 4 ft. 6 ins. depth of water in which to float, and thus a gap existed
between the last beetle and the beach. This gap was bridged by the shore ramp float, which
consisted of a wedge-shaped steel pontoon moored by land anchors.
The whole bridge was anchored by lengths of ordinary steel cable and a light grab an-
chor secured to the beetles at intervals along the length of the roadway.
A further small pierhead was built to the west of the Stores Pierhead to be used for dis-
charging cargoes of petrol, oil, and what may be termed "dangerous cargoes".

The bearing ends of the main girders terminate in a box end, which incorporates a spheri-
cal bearing (a cup at one end and a ball at the other end of each girder). The bearings are
secured by keepers to prevent vertical displacement, and by steel cable spring attachements
to prevent longitudinal displacement.
Bearing on the "beetles" is made by the "cup" end of the girder, the socket end of the
adjacent girder seating in this cup.
The bridge is handled in lengths approximately 500 ft. long (six bridge spans together
with the necessary pontoon floats and erection tank), the coupling on site of these lengths
taking approximately 15 minutes.
A telescopic span is introduced into each series of six bridge spans; this allows an ad-
justment of 9 ft. in the bridge length due to the movement of the sea, without interruption to
traffic. This telescopic span is designed on the principle of a match box, a sliding box
being introduced into the main girders, the decking panels being arranged to slide one over
the other. The gap between the bridge pieces over the supporting "beetles" is bridged by
a dished cover, which slides over the bridge deck.
Connection between the bridge and the pierhead is made on a pivot bed plate bolted to
the deck of the pierhead, the bed plate itself being capable of limited movement to take up
the play of the bridge. Connection between the bridge and the shore is made by the shore
end ramp.
Steel Beetles.
The standard steel float pontoon is composed of six welded airtight sections, the size of
each section allowing for transport by sea, road, rail or canal.
The complete pontoon is 15 ft. wide by 7 ft. deep and 41 ft. 9 ins. long (or 49 ft. 9 ins.
when eight sections are incorporated), shaped to permit towing in any direction, with a
shell backed deck which carries a transom of three R.S.Js which form the bearing for the
bridge girders. The weight of the smaller units is 16 tons, and the larger 20 tons. The
draft of the float when loaded with two standard bridge spans, is approximately 4 ft. 9 ins.
On a receding tide the floats can ground comfortably on a bed of sand, mud, gravel or
shingle, but to avoid grounding and bumping on rock, special spud legs are fitted. These
legs are formed of V-trestle column units, adjustable for length, fitted with a camels foot and
carrying a rock shoe to provide a bearing. They are lowered to rock before the fall of the
tide, and thus the float is left suspended on its legs as the tide recedes. This gives an op-
portunity of examining the rock bed, and if necessary sandbags or other buffering can be
laid to receive the float as she settles with the falling tide after removel of the legs. When
the bridge is supported on the spuds, the maximum load should not exceed 10 tons spaced
at 80 ft. intervals. Each spud can carry a safe vertical load of 20 tons. Reaction from bridge
spans and float is about 14 tons if levelling is carried out reasonably well.
During towing the spud legs are drawn up so that the camels foot is almost level with
the underside of the float.
Reinforced Concrete Beetles.
The reinforced concrete float pontoons are generally similar in all respects to the steel
pontoons described above, but are 41 ft. 9 ins. long 15 ft. 3 ins. or 18 ft. 9 ins. wide, and 8 ft.
6 ins. or 8 ft. 9 ins. deep. They are constructed of pre-cast concrete panels 1£ ins. thick,

with a span of 21 ins. between ribs. Division walls divide the unit into six watertight com-
partments, and these are also of pre-cast concrete panels. The joints between panels are
formed by in situ ribs. The weight of the smaller unit is about 45 tons, and the larger 55
tons.
Shore Ramp Float.
This unit comprises a shallow draught, light construction float formed in four welded
watertight sections, each 80 ft. long by 7 ft. 6ins. wide.
Sluice valves are provided so that the float may be grounded when desirable. The
weight of the complete unit is 45 tons.
5-ton winches with warping drums are provided for the purposes of anchoring, which is
carried out with the aid of two S.L.U.G. boats which are mounted on davits on the unit.
The shore ramp is positioned using temporary anchors, which are laid by the S.L.U.G.
boats, and as the tide rises the ramp is hauled further up the beach by the winches which
haul upon the land anchors.
Erection Tanks.
Erection tanks comprise a light steel cylinder float, their function being to allow for the
quick coupling of one 500 ft. bridge length to another.
The cylinder is 8 ft. diameter by 36 ft. long divided by a central watertight bulkhead into
two compartments, each of which is again divided by a bulkhead open along the lower edge.
Saddles are mounted on the cylinder as a bearing for the bridge pieces. The weight
of the whole is about 5£ tons.
Sluice valves with bottom entry , are provided at each end of the cylinder, and there are
air outlets from each compartment to ensure control of flooding.
The erection tank supports the bridge girder at a level of approximately 2 ft. above its
final position on the beetle. The two ends of the bridge length to be linked are manoeuvred
into position, the girder bearings being brougt close enough together to allow coupling
operations to commence. The erection tank is then flooded, which allows the girders to set-
tle on their bearings. Further flooding will cause the erection tank to sink free of the girders,
which allows it to be withdrawn from under the bridge. An air-cock is provided so that the
water can be expelled from the cylinder by means of compressed air.
Anchoring of Floating Roadway.
The bridging is anchored from the beetles. Mooring shuttles which are carried on the
bridge deck, to be launched when the bridge is in position, are used for this purpose. They
consist of a dumb raft formed by two long floats and supporting between them a drum on
which mooring wire has been wound. In addition to the drum the shuttle carries two kite
anchors.
The shuttle is launched from the bridge deck, paddled by the crew to the desired position
paying out the mooring wire en route, and the anchor is released at the predetermined posi-
tion.

SPUD PIERHEAD.
General Description.
The pierhead comprises a steel pontoon platform fitted with four mooring "spud legs,
one at each-corner. The pontoon is 200 ft. long by 60 ft. wide, and approximately 11 ft.
deep, with steel plate deck, sides and bottom. The framing consists of heavy steel girders
extending across the width, all enclosed within the depth of the pontoon. There are two
longitudinal bulkheads and seven cross bulkheads.
The spud legs, 90 ft long by 4 ft. square, are built up of steel plate with diaphragms.
These legs pass through long substantial guide frames, and are each fitted with pointed 9
ft. square mushroom feet, and thus provide vertical mooring, the pontoon travelling up
and down the spuds with the rise and fall of the tide.
Draft of pontoon 2 ft. 9 ins.
Draft of pontoon with spud legs up . . 6 ft. 11 ins. (from water line to bottom of spuds)
The pontoons are floated with the spuds raised.
In calm weather where no berthing forces have to be resisted, the pontoon is allowed to
float freely up and down the spuds. When anchorage is required to resist berthing or wave
shocks, the pontoons are "spudded," i.e., lifted sufficiently off flotation by means of winches
to give the extra downward thrust on the spud legs, thus holding them firmly on the sea bed.
Raising and lowering the spud legs is effected by two. 57 KW diesel generators and four
electrically operated winches. When the pontoon is "spudded," an operator must be in con-
tinuous attendance to raise or lower the pontoon in accordance with the tide.
Ammeter, 12 amps, in free condition, 50 amps, when "spudded" up to 6 ins., when load
on spuds is 160 tons.
PHOENIX R.C. CAISSONS.
General Description.
Each unit is divided into 22 cells (20 in the case of Unit D.) by cross walls and a central
longitudinal watertight bulkhead, all constructed in reinforced concrete.
The 22 cells are interconnected by means of 12 in. square open holes situated at the
base of the wall, forming 10 independent compartments, into which water can be admitted
by means of the main valves in the outer side walls of the caissons.
Penstocks are provided in six of the cross walls, thus reducing the number of separate
watertight compartments to four. These penstocks are intended for use only when the unit
is being pumped out.
Sinking is carried out by opening the flooding valves in the side walls of the caisson.
Two valves are provided for each of the 10 compartments, one 2 ft. above the floor level,
and the other 12 ft. above the floor level.
The time required for sinking depends on the operation of the valves, which, in turn,
is dependent on: —
1. Depth of water with relation to the size of unit.
2. Weather conditions and state of sea.
3. Trim of unit.
With all valves open, sinking time varies between 10 and 30 minutes, according to the
size of the caisson.

Refloating is carried out by pumping out the water, independent pumping -units being
positioned on either side of the caisson for this purpose. Pumping sets comprise either:—
two pumps with 9 in. suction; capacity 750 tons per pump per hour, or
four pumps with 4 in. suction; capacity 130 tons per pump per hour.
Water must be kept to the same level in each compartment to ensure that the caisson
lifts on an even keel. Final pumping (when head becomes too small for large pumps), is com-
pleted by 2 in. centrifugal bilge pumps of 100-120 gallons per minute capacity, one in each
of the compartments.
To lift the largest unit off the sea bed approximately 4,000 tons of water has to be
pumped out.
INTERMEDIATE STEEL PONTOONS.
General Description.
Steel pontoon units 75 ft. x 60 ft. x 10 ft. deep with a light draught of approximately 1 ft.
9 ins., generally of similar design to the pontoon platform of the spud pierhead.
INTERMEDIATE CONCRETE PONTOONS.
General Description.
Are generally similar to the Intermediate Steel Pontoons, but are constructed in reinforced
concrete.
These units are 80 ft. long by 58 ft. wide by 15 ft. deep, swan ended, and are protected
on all sides by timber tendering.
The deck is designed to carry 20 ton vehicles and 40 ton tanks.
The side walls, bottom slab, and bulkheads are of 2£ ins. thick precast concrete slabs
12 ft. 8 ins. long by 3 ft. wide, each weighing approximately 12 cwts. The decking is
composed of 4 ins thick precast slab units in panels 13 ft. 6 ins. x 3 ft. 6 ins which incorporate
the beams. Each deck unit weighs approximately 2 tons.
BUFFER PONTOONS.
These units are attached on each side of the Spud Pierhead and form an artificial beach
to allow for the discharge of vehicles, etc. from the lower deck of an L.S.T. at the same time
as deck vehicles on the craft can be discharged over the Spud Pierhead. The units con-
sists of an all welded steel hull, having a flat keel plate with vertical shell plating at the
sides and aft end.
The flat deck is curved to a definite surface, terminating in a rounded nose at the for-
ward end.
The deck is surfaced by a two-way grid of flat bottom rails, the space between the rails
being filled with concrete. The internal stiffening of the hull consists of welded plate dia-
phragms inclined at 45° to the central axis in both directions, thus forming cells in plan
with 6 ft. sides. These cells are used for compressor houses, water ballast, trimming and
flooding tanks. The whole unit is attached to the pierhead by hinged rocker bearings
about which the buffer pivots while floating. The free end can be depressed into the water
by flooding to the required depth to receive the beaching craft.

Safety,
Economy
and
Comfort
The opening of the Adelaide City and
Port Railway in 1856 was the beginning
of a Government utility that has pro-
gressed with the growth of South Aus-
tralia and materially assisted in the de-
velopment of the State. To safely carry
150 millions of passengers is a huge
transportation job, but add the exigen-
cies of war and it becomes colossal.
Such an undertaking was accomplished
by the South Australian Railways during
the war years in spite of a depleted staff,
coal rationing and record freight ton-
nages. Today £3O million of public
money is invested in your Railways and
a vigorous building programme has pro-
vided modern locomotives and rolling-
stock, ensuring the best service for the
transport of passengers and freight. The
safety and comfort of passengers is al-
ways paramount in the minds of the
Railways Administration and Staff, and
these factors, added to the fares and
rates operating, induce the discriminat-
ing public to utilize rail facilities to the
utmost.
P. F. CHERRY,
Secretary, Railways Commissioner.


EXHIBIT OF THE
COMMONWEALTH RECONSTRUCTION
TRAINING SCHEME.
(Education Department, South Australia)
EXPLANATORY
The Commonwealth Reconstruction Train-
ing Scheme was instituted for the purpose
of training ex-service men and women in
trades, callings and professions so that they
might be successfully rehabilitated into civi-
lian life after prolonged service in the armed
forces.
To this end, the Technical branch of the
Education Department of South Australia
has organized 9 technical training centres,
named according to their locations (Grenfell
Street, Pirie Street, North Terrace, Frome
Road, Gawler Place, Goodwood, LeFevre,
Finsbury, Largs Bay), in which 650 full-time
trainees are taught 22 different trades and
callings.
Trainees in these schools are given in-
tensive and comprehensive instruction for
six months, when, on reaching an efficiency
equivalent to 40% of that of a fully qualified
tradesman, they are placed with an em-
ployer who continues their instruction "on
the job," supplemented by evening classes
conducted by the C.R.T.S.
The school tuition is in the hands of a
staff of 66 qualified instructors who give
training in Carpentry, Joinery, Bricklaying,
Plastering (Solid and Fibrous), Stone-
masonry, Plumbing, Cabinet-making, Paint-
ing, Sign-writing, French Polishing, Tiling,
Upholstery, Wood-machining, Tailoring,
Boot repairing, Surgical Bootmaking, Hair-
dressing, Stenography, Clerical work, Dress-
making, and Electrical mechanics.
EXHIBITS.
The three sections of the exhibit are in-
tended to give practical illustrations of the
main educational technique of the Scheme,
that is, "Learning by doing."
First Section:
Trainees of the first thirteen trades named
above (the building and allied trades) en-
tirely built, decorated, and furnished the first
part of the exhibit, a modern four-roomed
structure, as a functional example of the de-
gree of skill which they attained during their
training period of six months.
The building, showing a variety of inter-
nal and external treatments and indicating
some of the briok, stone, and wall finishes
which are covered in the regular course of
training, contains a lounge, an up-to-date
kitchen, a bathroom, and an inquiry office
and information bureau. As an illustration
of modem visual aids to learning which
have been adopted, training films (strip,
silent, and talkie) will be shown in this pavi-
lion. (Building No. 105).

IN THE CENTENNIAL HALL


Second Section:
Like the first section, the open-air site in
the southern portion of the grounds was also
constructed by trainees. The columns and
wall treatments shown here have been pre-
pared by those training as bricklayers and
plasterers as entries in the competitions for
such work.
In addition to this competitive work, build-
ing trades classes will be operating under
normal school conditions to show the man-
ner in which the classes are conducted dur-
ing the training period. (Building No. 265).
Third Section:
In the adjacent weather-board pavilion
further classes will be at work. During the
period of the Exhibition the classes will be
changed from time to time; for example, the
tailoring group will carry on training for a
time in the precise manner in which they
work in their usual quarters. The tailors
will then give place to other groups, such as
upholsterers, signwriters, etc.
In addition to the trainees at work, there
will be an exhibition of samples of work
carried out by classes many of which have
been entered in official competitions by in-
dividual students.
As an illustration of part-time training
under the C.R.T.S., an exhibit indicating the
scope of instruction to 5,000 students of the
Technical Correspondence School is also
housed in this building. The various types
of instructional material, administrative re-
cords, etc., are open for inspection, together
with examples of the exercises submitted by
students. (Buildings Nos. 266 and 267).
CONCLUSION.
The Commonwealth Reconstruction Train-
ing Scheme is thus seen to comprise many
parts, but it is unified in its aim towards a
common goal of training each student to the
highest point of efficiency in the minimum
time. The whole exhibit is intended to show
both the manner and the result of this train-
ing.

varied activities.
WOODS AND FORESTS DEPARTMENT.
This exhibit is housed in "Radiata Cot-
tage" (western portion of the ground facing
the Amusement Park) which was built in
1929 to prove the value of S.A. Plantation
grown Radiata Pine as a general utility tim-
ber for all building purposes. Since that
time the faith of the Department in this
timber has been amply demonstrated. In
1929 Radiata Pine was unknown to the
majority of people, tradesmen and others
alike. Today Radiata is almost a household
word.
It is Radiata Pine that makes the present
vital housing programme possible. Timber
is in short supply and flooring is probably
the most difficult of all to obtain. For months
past no flooring has been received from
overseas or from other Australian States.
Radiata Pine from the South Australian
Government Forests is meeting this need en-
tirely and stands between a successful and
expanding housing programme and a total
collapse of building operations.
Could any more striking evidence be
necessary of the tremendous value of the
State's forest industry and of this timber to
the community?
The cutting off of overseas timber supplies
during the war brought Radiata Pine very
much into the lime-light and the Department
was called upon to fill a hundred and one
urgent demands. Timber was provided for
the manufacture of ammunition and explo-
sive boxes, flooring for tents and huts for the
troops, and for many camp, aerodrome,
munition factory buildings and many other
purposes—millions of feet of it.
Radiata Pine also provided the cellulose
for the manufacture of nitro-cellulose, a
highly important explosive. Thousands of
logs were sent from the South Eastern
forests to Melbourne and pulped for the
manufacture of this essential product to pro-
duce explosives and ammunition for the
Navy, Army and Air Force.
Many people may not realise the part
played by pine timber from the State Forests
in the every day life of the community. If
they are not building a house or purchasing
new furniture, timber and its uses may not
interest them particularly. A little reflection,
however, will make one realise that there
are many and varied uses for timber. Take
matches for instance, something that most
people handle every day and many times
a day. "Timber" in one of its most common
domestic uses. Do you know that the
matches you have used during most of the
war years and are still using are made with
pine timber from the forests of this State?
Overseas supplies of match sticks com-
pletely failed during the war and this forced
the match factories to find an Australian
substitute. Radiata Pine met this need, and
timber for over 500 million boxes of matches
has been supplied. It requires little imagi-
nation to picture the inconvenience which
would have resulted had a match famine
occurred. Matches have not been plentiful
but there has been sufficient for most require-
ments.
Plywood is another product which has
been in short supply during the war years
and still is. Here again Radiata Pine came
to the rescue. Fifty per cent, of the plywood
available in South Australia during the past
several years has been produced from
Radiata Pine logs supplied from the State
Forests.
Before the war Radiata Pine was used for
making fruit and other cases, but many were
also made from imported timber.
Today overseas timber is practically un-
procurable and case users are relying al-
most entirely on the State Forests for their
supplies and these needs are being met.
The importance of this to the River Murray
and other fruit growing areas both for local
trade and export, and also for the packing
of many manufactured goods, is obvious.
The Department alone supplies over 2 mil-
lion cases per annum, and this will shortly
be raised to 3 million. Other case mills
supply as many or more than this number.
The Cellulose Mill at Millicent has also
played its part during the war years and
since. This factory uses large quantities of
Radiata Pine logs for pulping and manufac-
ture into a wide range of cardboards for

ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
It is, therefore, of paramount importance that you should insist on
your car being fitted with Safety Glass in all windows. By doing so, you
will protect yourself and your family from severe cuts with their lifelong
legacy of unsightly scars.
Insure yourself and your family against disfigurement by making sure
that YOUR car is fitted with Safety Glass.
"ARMOURPLATE" Safety Glass is a heat treated glass which is several
times as strong as ordinary plate glass. Should it break it disintegrates
into tiny pieces which are incapable of causing serious injury.
"Triplex" Safety Glass is a laminated Safety Glass with an interlayer
of plastic material which, if the glass is broken, holds the pieces and prevents
them from flying and causing injury.
Both these types of Safety Glass are manufactured by

boxes, cartons and many other uses. It is
just another instance of the growing im-
portance of the Forestry Industry in the life
and economy of this State.
These are only some of the uses for
Radiata Pine. Visit "Radiata Cottage" and
see for yourself what the "man made"
forests of South Australia mean to you and
to the State. These forests are yours and it
is in your interest to know what is being
done. As yet, the industry is in its infancy,
development, however, is reaching an im-
portant stage and from now on growth will
be rapid. In a very few years forestry and
timber will be one of the major industries
and employers of labour in this State.
The Government wants you to know what
the Woods and Forests Department is doing,
and your knowledge and interest will be an
encouragement to greater achievements.
DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE HALL.
Representative exhibits covering all
phases of Department of Agriculture activi-
ties assisted by the Produce Department,
Roseworthy Agricultural College, Waite
Agricultural Research Institute and Depart-
ment of Chemistry are on display at the
Department's own pavilion situated on the
northern side of the grounds in close proxi-
mity to the Centennial Hall. (Pavilion No. 4).
The Department is staging this compre-
hensive display in an ideal setting, the
handsome pavilion, after years of military
occupation, having been completely reno-
vated, refitted and redecorated in attractive
presentation.
Featured amongst the many sections is
a well-considered exhibition of soil erosion,
which should prove highly educational,
dealing as it does with a problem so much
in the public eye.
Other sections contributing to a most in-
teresting general display include those deal-
ing with cereals, wool, fruit, the milling
qualities of wheat, veterinary science, dairy-
ing, poultry, pastures, fertilizers, pest des-
troyers, plant diseases and honey.
Added interest is given to the honey ex-
hibit by reason of the fact that the bees
shown working in a glass hive are from the
Government Ligurian Bee Project on Kan-
garoo Island.
An hour given to viewing the various ex-
hibits will be well spent, for they are de-
signed to interest both rural producer and
townsman.
S.A. GOVERNMENT IMMIGRATION,
PUBLICITY AND TOURIST BUREAU.
A display of travel posters, photographic
enlargements, and transparencies will be
made in a lounge and rest room in the
Government Pavilion.

The exhibits from the Garden Suburb
Commissioner's Office will include a per-
spective drawing of the suburb by the de-
signer, Mr. C. C. Reade, and aerial photo-
graphs of the principal points of interest,
including schools, recreation reserves and
shopping centre, illustrating the present
stage of development after 25 years' work.
DEPARTMENT OF MINES.
The central exhibit in the space allotted
to the Department of Mines will be a dia-
mond drilling machine. Around this will
be displayed in show cases and in open
formation the various diamond bits used
with the machine in drilling rock. There
will also be a collection of core-recovery
appliances.

ores which are much in the public notice
at the moment, and large typical specimens
of the more important metallic and non-
metalllic minerals produced in the State will
be on show.
The large specimens will be given their
respective geographical position in the State
