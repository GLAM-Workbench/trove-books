PROGRESS AND DEVELOPMENT OF LAND SETTLEMENT IN QUEENSLAND.
Permanent land settlement is one of the stepping-
stones to national prosperity. On it a country’s greatness
and independence largely rests. A fairly prosperous
and contented agrarian population is a reliable staff even
to a declining State; it is to the State, indeed, what air is
to life. It is little wonder, then, that statesmen are to be
found studying every phase of land settlement; that
Governments are assiduously advancing it. The subject
is now universally regarded as a field for the exercise
of useful experiments. Men have been appointed every-
where to watch existing and developing conditions, and as
necessity, born of constant change, has demanded, they
have endeavoured to bring things into line. In the
marshalling of resultant effects Queensland may claim to
be among the most prominent. She is certainly not among
the least successful. She believes that in a system of
progressive land settlement is concentrated both people,
production, and wealth. It is, therefore, sound public policy
to encourage it. These efforts to bring the subject up to
date has necessarily led to many and frequent altera-
tions in the land laws. Those who have failed to
comprehend the special circumstances of the case have
seen grievance in this. Possibly had the land laws
been allowed to remain stationary there would still have
been complaint. Obviously, in the latter event, the ground
for fault-finding would have been more reasonable. The
fAot has been lost sight of that Queensland has been and
still is largely a pastoral country with extensive sheep and
cattle stations. But the process of evolution has set in.
Closer settlement is being aimed at, for with smaller hold-
ings comes increased carrying capacity, and as a conse-
quence greater production and more wealth. At the present
time, it may be remarked, this carrying capacity per acre
is about equal to that of New South Wales, and official
opinion gives it as a reasonable prediction that when
Queensland’s large holdings become subdivided as those of
the mother colony are, the grazing capabilities will be more
than quadrupled. On the volcanic formation, such as the
black soil of Darling Downs, and on the lower cretaceous
formation, which forms such a large proportion of the area
of the colony, the pasture is not excelled in any portion of
the Australian continent.
There are also the agricultural capabilities of the
country to be considered. Opinion on this matter is
hardly less emphatic. In this class of land, as in pastoral,
the aim of legislation of late years has been to prevent


the monopoly of the land by a few in immense freehold
blocks, and to promote either its alienation to, or occupa-
tion by, a large number of smaller holders. A recent
able writer has summed up the question as regards
agriculture in the following concise words : —“Eor the
first half of the period of the colony’s separate exist-
ence, agriculture was almost wholly neglected by her
people. Those living in, or in the immediate neighbourhood
of, the towns devoted themselves to trade and commerce,
while the scattered rural population saw greater attractions
in sheep-farming and the search for gold than in the pur-
suit of agriculture. But in a colony possessing a coastline
stretching from the temperate zone well into the tropical
—from a latitude with a climate congenial to oats and the
apple to a latitude with a climate congenial to coffee and
the sugar-cane —possessing, in short, variations of soil and
climate and geographic conditions equal to the produc-
tion of all the food requirements of man and beast, it w r as
not likely that the neglect of the cultural industries
would continue for very long Little groups
of agriculturists settled down on the slopes of the coast
range, and became the pioneers of farming in what is
destined in the not far distant future to become one of
the greatest agricultural colonies of the group.”
How agriculture and closer pastoral settlement has
progressed can perhaps best be shown by figures. But,
first of all, some idea of the relative size of Queensland
may be useful. It w r ill at any rate serve to demonstrate
that so far as extent of territory is concerned there is plenty
of room for the new comer. In size it stands almost peer-
less amongst Great Britain’s colonial possessions. It is
seven and a-half times the size of Victoria, more than two
and a-half times that of New South Wales, more than six
and a-half times larger than New Zealand, twenty-one
and a-half times the size of Tasmania, and about twice
the size of Canada. When compared with the older
countries it is found to be eleven and a-half the
size of England and Wales, more than twenty-two times
the size of Scotland, and the same size with regard to
Ireland.
Its area in square miles is 668,497, or 427,838,080
acres. The comparison made some years ago by the Depart-
ment with some of the English counties is worth republish-
ing. The figures given show Queensland to be —
342 times the size of Northumberland
110 „ ~ Yorkshire
354 „ „ Lancashire
2,375 „ „ Middlesex
916 „ „ Buckinghamshire
258 „ „ Devonshire
495 „ ~ Cornwall.
Out of this area of 427,838,080 acres, roughly speaking,
only 13,932,379 are alienated or in process of alienation,
and 271,271,312 are leased, leaving 142,034,389 neither
alienated nor leased. The effective area of Queensland
has been set down as 285,203,691, which is very much


larger than that of any other colony. As compared with
New South Wales it is 114,940,839 acres larger. This
vast territory is populated by a mere handful of people.
At the end of 1894 they totalled 445,155. In this connec-
tion, however, it is worth remembering that thirty years
earlier the population barely reached 78,000, while at the
time of Separation (1859), it stood at about 25,000 only.
Accompanying the figures for 1894 it should be stated
that the export of produce for the year was valued at
£8,795,559, and the revenue was £3,358,302, of which
£588,612 was derived from the public lands.
And now to revert to the pastoral and agricultural
industries. As a pastoral colony Queensland holds the
second place in the group, having more cattle than all the
six other colonies reckoned together, and almost as many
sheep as New Zealand. A comparison of the live stock in
the colony for the first three years of her existence as a
separate colony and for the last three years is interesting.
Consulting the official figures, the following picture is pre-
sented :

A comparison for the same periods as to the quantity
and value of wool exported is equally convincing, while it
also furnishes a bird’s-eye view of the fall in values —values
which recent sales have fortunately shown to be decidedly
on the mend.

The trade done in meat may be ganged by the follow-
ing statement, which shows the sheep and cattle frozen,
preserved, and boiled, in 1894, at the respective works.
It may be mentioned that the current year’s returns will
greatly exceed those of 1894, while the capacity of the
works for 1896 will represent 397,000 head of cattle, or
As regards agriculture steady progress has been made.
The figures published for 1894 demonstrate this fact.
Generalising for the moment, it may be stated that the
area under cultivation was 284,552 acres, an increase of
32,477 acres over 1893. Of this 28,997 was under wheat
and 103,671 under maize. There were also 10,523 acres
under potatoes, 28,028 acres under hay, and 71,818 acres
of sugar. In the latter crop Queensland left her only
competitor, New South Wales, a long way behind, and
she took an equally indisputable lead in tropical fruits.
Perhaps a more thorough grasp of the position can be
obtained by a study of the figures in tabular form.
Taking first the area under cultivation, it is found
that during the last five years the position has been this:—

It may, of course, be urged that, however good the
returns have been, the figures do nothing more than
illustrate the progress made ; that the money return to
the farmer is still obscured. There is considerable force
in the contention, for, after all, it is not, from a farmer’s
point of view, so much the extent of the yield as the price
of his produce which interests him most. “ A half crop
pays better than a full one” is an oft-quoted axiom in
agricultural centres. But to arrive at any reliable con-
clusion on this point is attended with difficulty, while the
danger of comparison is too risky to be undertaken ; nor
would comparison serve a very useful purpose. To tell a
farmer that wheat in 1891 fetched 3s. 3d. against 3s. in
1895 would not be nearly so interesting to him as would
be the average prices for the preceding few months. In
the one case he would know what he might have obtained
had he been on the spot so much earlier; in the other he
can fairly gauge his possibilities at the present time-
Recognising this, then, the average market price of farm
produce has been carefully taken out with a view to the
farmer arriving at a conclusion in accord with his own
desires or views as to the crops he will grow. The follow-
ing table, compiled with care, gives the average ruling
rates for the five months commencing Ist July, 1895, and
ending 30th November, 1895 :

Ploughing and Harrowing on the Downs.


Before closing this necessarily brief statement let it
not be supposed that all the farmers in Queensland are in
the fever heat of prosperity. There is poverty, of course;
but it is oftener than not due to bad farming born of
inexperience and lack of self-reliance and enterprise. That
Queensland presents unique advantages to the man with
small means, a little brains, and big muscle is, however,
undeniable.
“Farming,” remarked Professor Shelton, the Govern-
ment expert, in his last report, “ does not tend to individual
aggrandisement. It cap have no attractions for the
speculator anxious to acquire the wealth of the land without
giving an equivalent. But, if the cultivation of the soil
does not lead to opulence, it gives what is much better —
independence. It, better than any other calling, meets
the capacities and satisfies the wants and ambitions of the
common, average men who make up the great mass of
humanity. Anyone who will open his eyes can see the
immeasurable superiority of Queensland farmers to the
like class —the labourers, mechanics, and small tradesmen
—of the towns, in all that ministers to contentment. The
past year has been a particularly trying one to the farmers
of the colony, by reason of the low values of those things
which stand for the farmer’s labour. But low prices have
not been confined to Queensland. Wheat, maize, hay,
butter, cheese, and pork have uniformly during the year
sold for higher—often much higher—prices here than in
Canada and the Western American States.”
The Courier , too, discussing more particularly the
recent purchase of the Government on the Downs, offered
the following cogent remarks : —“ It is nonsense to say that
there is or can be no profitable agriculture in Queensland.
If anyone would see what a mighty difference is made by
skill and enterprise and co-operation, let him compare the
present sugarlandswith the same laudsunder old occupation,
or the present cane-grower of Northern Queensland with the
small holder of farm land in South Queensland. What
are the lessons of the contrast ? We see that going for
an outside market helps. The outside market is generally
a large market, and therefore a steady and reliable market.
Moreover, it delivers the farmer from the truck system,
into which he falls so readily under other conditions, and
which makes the burden of his life. We see the prime
importance of a regard to the natural potentialities of soil
and climate. Look at Mr. Reading growing sugar-cane
above the frostline at Fassifern, to the astonishment of his
poor neighbours, who, nevertheless, have saved themselves
during the recent drought by following his example. Or
look at Mr. McCormick’s advice to the small farmers of
Bundaberg, whose cane has been bitten by frost, and
whose attention is now directed to dairying with a view to
export. These instances, too, show the advantages of
co-operation: the first in regard to sugar-mills, and the
second in regard to butter factories. The Downs is a
splendid dairy country ; the grasses hitherto eulogised for
their power of fattening may equally be eulogised for their
power of butter-making; the cereals produced so freely


may, whenever occasion arises, be used to the same
purpose. Why should not such a country as this be closely
settled?”
Reverting now to the growth of sugar, it should be
remembered that its cultivation was rudely arrested by
the Act of 1885, which prohibited the further importation
of Polynesian labour after 1890. The industry was to all
intents and purposes annihilated for the time being. It can
now only be said to have been again placed on its feet con-
sequent upon the revival of the Island trade and the
establishment on a sound basis of the central-mill system.
The statistics given, therefore, denote an actual progress
greater than is apparent without a knowledge of this
fact. Sugar-cane cultivation has gained a fair foot-
hold throughout the whole of that great stretch of
country lying between the coast and the range, and
varying in width from 20 to 50 miles. In 1893 59,251
acres of this country were cropped, and 76,146 tons of
sugar produced; while in 1894 the area had risen to
71,818 acres, and the product to 91,712 tons. The number
of mills now in operation shows a marked shrinkage, but
this is due to to the fact that the many small and
ineffective plants—most of them devoted to crushing only
—which previously were dotted all over the colony, have
disappeared, and have been replaced by more powerful
as well as more modern appliances,
may help the reader to more thorc
position

The figures representing population, imports, and
exports are worth pondering over. In 1867, for instance,
it is found that 99,849 people used £108,146 worth of
sugar grown and made by others, and exported only 3
tons of the local article—presumably all that was made.
Looking at the figures for 1894, what a different picture

is presented! After satisfying the wants of 445,155
people (for the imports were only 51 tons) 64,910 tons,
valued at £886,834, were sent to countries creating a
demand. Nothing could be more suggestive of the develop-
ment of agriculture. In the figures some idea is given of
the way in which the jungle of semi-tropical Queensland
has been won to man as well as of the climatic advantages
of the colony which allows of such a wide range of varia-
tion in crops, for much of the land that is now under
sugar w T as once under maize, some of it was under wheat,
and not an insignificant area was under products the
growth of which elsewhere is restricted to the temperate
zone.
The confidence manifested in the industry is well
evidenced in the fact that £1,250,000 have been invested
by private persons and corporations, and to meet the still
pressing need for further power £500,000 has been voted
by the Government to be applied under a system of
guarantee. The security to the State consists of the mills
and the lands of the farmers, who are shareholders in the
concerns. As in the case of pastoral lands, large planta-
tions have been subdivided, and immense tracts of virgin
country opened up. Those who previously cultivated great
tracts of country now devote their attention to crushing
alone. Indeed, the sugar industry may be said to have
become divided into three distinct branches —the cultiva-
tion of the cane plant, the crushing and manufacture into
sugar, and the refining. In this latter connection a very
large trade is now done, particularly by the Colonial
Sugar Refinery Company, who have established a complete
branch refinery on the Brisbane River. Literally the planter
of other days is no more ; he is a manufacturer pure and
simple. And this departure to the lines of the subdivision
of labour is working out well. When the manufacturer
was his own cultivator he did not buy from the farmer, but
cultivation now passing from his hands he must needs offer
the farmer every inducement to keep his mill going. Thus
it is that contracts have been made with the farmers
extending over several years at prices which ensures
prosperity for him, whatever happens the manufacturer.
In some cases this means 13s. 6d. per ton, and in some
cases, where the farmer is a shareholder in the mill, he
is getting up to 16s. per ton. The position was well
summarised by Miss Shaw when she said : “ It has been
recognised that planting can be carried on much more
economically upon a small scale than it.can upon a large
scale, while manufacture is better and more profitable
with the resources of a considerable capital at command.
Economically and politically, that system
has such definite advantages that the only matter for
surprise is that they have not been recognised before."
The same lady had the following observations to make
anent the position of the farmer :—“ In the North, on the
cleared scrub land of the Herbert River, that system of
small farming is in full activity. Here selectors, living
upon 160-acre Government lots, are growing cane with
great success for the neighbouring mills. Amongst several
into whose accounts I went with some care, I found that


the man who was least well off had cleared 100 acres of
land, of which 70 acres were under cane, and that he w r as
making an income of about £BOO a year, with working
expenses of £5OO. He had started originally as a plough-
man without any capital, and, in addition to his land, now
possesses a very good two-storied house and all the horses
and implements necessary to the cultivation of his farm.
. . . The proportion between wording expenses and
gross receipts was generally as five to eight.” This
cannot be said to truly describe the condition of
the bulk of the farmers now growing cane, but it
fairly illustrates the possibilities of the case; while the
description of the populated condition of the Herbert
Eiver lands is true of the sugar districts in many other
portions of the colony. But important as the settlement
of a farming population on the sugar lands undoubtedly is,
there is underlying it all the promised solution of a very
complex problem. It will be the means whereby the
employment of black labour will be rendered unnecessary.
Present appearances certainly indicate that with the
progress made in the growth of sugar will come the decline
of Polynesians as cultivators.
From the figures given earlier in this article it will
be seen that maize is, next to sugar, the most important
crop. No less than 2,684,925 bushels were taken off the
103,671 acres cropped during ’94. In maize the mother
colony assumes the position claimed by Queensland in
sugar ; but Queensland occupies second place, and produces
probably three times as much as the remaining five colonies.
Maize grows well not only on all the coast rivers, but also
on the western slopes of the Main Eange. The grain from
the latter locality being dry and less liable to the attacks
of weevil is in greater demand for shipping. The rate at
which the cultivation of this cereal is expanding in
Queensland warrants the assumption that before many
years have passed the output will equal, if not actually
exceed, that of New South Wales. The wheat crop, too,
is gradually growing into significant dimensions. Its
progress of recent years has been regular if not alarming.
For thirty years or more wheat has been successfully
grown in the northern colony, still it can only be said to
have recently emerged from the experimental stage. For
many years its cultivation was confined to the Darling
Downs, of which Toowoomba and Warwick are the
centres ; but since ’9l the farmers of the Maranoa (of
which Eoma is the centre) have devoted a good deal of
attention to the crop, and with results which seem to
indicate that the western plains of Queensland are destined
to become an important factor in tbe world’s supply of
breadstuffs. In the early days of wheat farming red rust
frequently played havoc with the crops; but in spite of
many discouragements the farmers persevered, and it is
gratifying to be able to record that success has rewarded
their persistent efforts. Judicious selection of seed has
led to the discovery of varieties which not only mature
early but are rust-resisting to such a degree that the
scourge no longer possesses for the wheat farmer the
terror with which it inspired him in the early days when


the softer varieties were almost exclusively grown. It is
many years now since rust made a clean sweep of the
Queensland wheat crop. Incidentally it may be mentioned
that the Department of Agriculture has, since Professor
Shelton’s advent, been carrying on exhaustive experiments
with a view, among other things, to testing the suitable-
ness of the soil and climate for wheat-growing. The
results of the observations made at the six stations are
significant because of their success. The extensive nature
of the wheat lands is indicated by the fact that the experi-
ments ranged over about 800 miles of country, north and
south, extending inland in the case of one station over
300 miles. The following table denotes the progress
which the wheat-growing industry has made during the
past five years:—
Area Sown. Eeturn of Grain
Teafcr. Acres. per Acre.
1890 ... 12,063 ... 2020 bushels
1891 ... 20,519 ... 20-32 „
1892 ... 33,332 ... 14*57 „
1893 ... 31,750 ... 14-25 „
1894 ... 34,387 ... 18*80 „
The average for the five years, it will be seen, was 17"27
bushels per acre, which is very much higher than that of
any of the other continental colonies. In the last sixteen
years Queensland has ten times stood at the head of the
Australasian colonies in the yield of wheat per acre; and
only three times has she been the lowest on the list, while
the average yield of the Queensland wheatfields during
this period has been, according to Professor Shelton’s
statistics, nearly five bushels per acre above the average of
the other four colonies for the same time. These facts
will only bear of one interpretation. Queensland’s present
requirements of breadstuffs aggregate 2,500,000 bushels of
wheat annually ; and, as the total home production amounts
to little more than 500,000 bushels, there is room for
material expansion before the demand for home consump-
tion is supplied. This, taken in conjunction with the fact
that there is an import duty of 4d. per bushel on wheat
and £1 per ton on flour, serves to emphasise the assertion
that the Queensland wheat-grower is in a position to com-
mand the highest price ruling in Australia. Still last year
34,004 tons of flour and 415,734 bushels of wheat were
imported from the southern colonies. There are flour-
mills, fitted with modern roller machinery, at Warwick
(two), Allora, Toowoomba (two), Eoma, Brisbane (two),
and Maryborough.
Other grains crops also do well in Queensland. Last
year oats gave a return of 20-62 bushels to the acre; still
T 72,448 bushels (which paid Bd. duty) and £12,066 worth
of oatmeal had to be imported. Barley yielded at the rate
of 26"67 bushels per acre; “ and,” says the Eegistrar-
General, “ it has now been satisfactorily settled that barley
of good quality, fit for malting, can be grown on the
Darling Downs, if not in many other parts of the colony
yet malt to the value of £42,420 was imported in 1894 —
the duty being 4s. 6d. per bushel, a handsome price in
itself. Experienced farmers should find the growing of
malting barley a profitable occupation in Queensland.


Queensland is now most in w r aut of farmers. She
already has a market for much more than she produces.
When her own wants are supplied, facilities for transport-
ing the surplus to places where it can be taken in are at
her very door. Shipping has been provided in anticipation,
as it were. No less a sum than £500,000 is sent away
every year for malting barley, oats, wheat, onions, and
potatoes alone. The Registrar-General discusses these
neglected avenues of production in his last annual report.
Among other things he says :
“ That many channels are yet open for the production
of commodities still imported is abundantly proved on
viewing the list of imports for 1894.
“ During that year there passed through the Customs
goods, the products of agriculture, aggregating in value
no less than £691,041, of which the following figures give
the details. As it is, how r ever, instructive to show the
difference between the value of such imports, comparing
the results of 1894 with the two previous years, the table
is made a comparative one in this respect —
1892. 1893. 1891,
£ £ £
Grain and various products thereof 549,149 497,821 423,820
Fruit 108,011 99,315 94,160

Other products of agriculture ... 107,773 84,999 109,100
£799,491 £740,570 £691,041
From this will be observed the effect of increased
home production on imports of grain and fruit. The
figures relating to the import of vegetables are not so
satisfactory, and a close examination of the details discloses
unreconcilable features, for, whilst agricultural products
generally w r ere at a very low price in 1894, and potatoes
especially quoted as unsaleable, it is found that onions to
the value of £16,672 were imported last year, notwith-
standing the existence of a protective duty of 20s. per ton.
The imports of onions and potatoes for the past three years
were—

Potatoes... 26,824 41,431*38,013
Other products of agriculture imported still show room for
further development in production.
It should be mentioned, too, that successful coffee-
growing has been demonstrated. Considerable areas of
land have been placed under this product during the past
year, and the Department of Agriculture (which dissemi-
nates much useful knowledge) reports that inquiries are
frequently to hand from persons in India and Ceylon
relative to the conditions under which land suitable for
coffee can be secured. It has been proved that the area of
country suitable for coffee is large, and there is evidence
that the cultivation of this product will assume great
dimensions, and rank among the prominent agricultural
industries. It is now grown—and grown luxuriantly—as

far south as Brisbane. The question of labour has hitherto
been a bar to extended cultivation, but, as it has been
decided that Pacific Island labour can be employed in
connection therewith, one obstacle against its extended
cultivation has been removed. Eice also is cultivated in
the Northern districts, last year’s crop giving 25,000
bushels. Tobacco is now largely grown, several large
factories—the majority in Brisbane—drawing their supply
from the local market. Some idea of the growth of
tobacco can be formed from the figures given by the
Eegistrar-General, which show that while 475 acres (giving
an average yield of 964 cwt. per acre) had been cropped
in 1893, the area cultivated had in 1894 increased to 914
acres, the average yield being 10’47 cwt. per acre. The
total yield was about 9,571 cwt., but the significant fact is
that the average yield had increased nearly 1 cwt. per
acre. If this proves anything at all, it is that the Queens-
land tobacco-grower is gaining experience in the cultivation
of the product. It is a matter for regret that Europeans do
not enter more largely into the industry, for with the average
price of leaf at Bd. per lb. it is admitted that its prosecution
can be carried out at a satisfactory profit. The chief
tobacco-growing centres are Texas, Warwick, Killamey,
Stanthorpe, Inglewood, and Goondiwindi. As will have
been observed, other products which have become staple
industries, such as potatoes, lucerne, cotton (for the mill
at Ipswich), prairie grass (last year there were 17,312
acres of artificially sown pasture laid down), pineapples,
the citrus fruits, bananas, and grapes, are also cultivated
successfully. Experimental areas of sugar-beet, grown on
Glengallan and other Downs stations, have yielded up to
10 30 tons to the acre.
It has been complained that, notwithstanding the
spurt in matters agricultural which has manifested
itself during the last few years, progress on the whole
does not bear favourable comparison with the develop-
ments of the older colonies. This complaint is gene-
rally based on unfair comparison. Taking everything
into consideration, Queensland’s record is a particularly
striking one. Eeviewing the figures which have been
given, it is demonstrated that in the lifetime of a
single generation she has increased her population
from 25,000 to 445,000. Her sheep number 19,587,091,
and her cattle over 7,000,000, to say nothing of the
444,000 horses and an increasing herd of pigs (they
now number something like 90,000), for bacon-curing
has during the past two or three years grown to
a remarkable extent. Pig-raising is now recognised as
one of the best assets the farmer has; and he now
breeds, thanks to the efforts of the factory-owners, a
uniform animal for which he has a close and profitable
market. But to return to the review. There has been
put under cultivation 284,552 acres. Queensland’s sugar
crop tots up to something like £1,000,000 a year, and her
goldmines yield £2,378,288, her yearly revenue being
3| millions. Settlement has been extended over the
entire area of her immense territory, which is covered
with a network of 9,986 miles of telegraphs and 2,379’


miles of railways; while a market has been established
for British goods to the amount of £4,337,400, and an
export trade created of nearly £9,000,000.
But, after all, the figures are even more interesting as
a forecast than as a retrospect. What has been accom-
plished in the past is capable of much greater and more
rapid extension in the future under the facilities which the
Government, acting on experience, have provided. Only
last year Parliament passed an Act having for its object
the repurchase of estates in proximity to populated
centres. This Act has already been put into opera-
tion ; large areas of three of the best estates on the
Darling Downs, and one at the foot of the range, have
been bought on which to try the initial experiment of
converting sheep-walks into cultivation areas. Surveyors
are now engaged in subdividing the land into suitable
blocks for close settlement, and these will be made avail-
able for selection on and alter the 18th February 1896.
Then, as has already been said, State aid has been authorised
to assist in the erection of central sugar-mills. This aid
represents £500,000. Liberal advances —to the extent of
50 per cent., on easy terms of repayment—are made
towards the erection of cheese and butter factories, and in
addition there is provision by law for the payment of
bonuses on the export of dairy produce. Low railway
rates render it possible to transport farm produce long
distances at a profit. Cold storage is to be provided for
perishable goods in the railway yards at Brisbane ; and the
new contract with the British India Steam Navigation Com-
pany, which operates from the Ist January, 1896, contains
conditions binding the company to supply the steamers
trading regularly between Brisbane and London with
refrigerating machinery and ample space for cargoes of
meat, dairy produce, fruit, &c., in view of the expansion
of the export trade in these and other articles. The
effects of this and other provisions are already being felt,
for it has stimulated private enterprise to an extent hitherto
unknown, and cold storage works and factories are being
erected in various parts of the country and in the centres.
In closing this review the recent developments in
dairying call for some slight mention. These developments
tend to the extension of the factory system as applied to
the industry. Where milk is available in any large
quantity, either a factory or creamery has sprung into
existence, though not without vigorous protest from the
more conservative dairymen. The complete breaking down
of these old-time notions is, however, only a matter of a
short time. Experience teaches in dairying as in other
walks of life ; and the experience gained from elsewhere,
particularly Victoria, declares that if Queensland dairy
produce is to get anything like a firm foothold on the
markets of the world, one of the first principles to be
learned is uniformity of quality. This can only come
through one channel—the factory. As showing the
growth of this system it need only be said that on the 30th
May last there were in Southern Queensland twenty-three
cheese and butter factories of the first class, and twenty-


seven creameries as against sixteen factories and thirteen
creameries previously. Consulting the import and export
returns for 1893 and 1894 it is found that Queensland is
gradually meeting home demands. The quantity of butter
brought in during the first-named period was 271,106 lb.,
valued at £11,456, but in 1894 the quantity had fallen to
221,724 lb., of a money value of £9,485. The figures in
respect of cheese are even more encouraging, for while in
1893 366,031 lb. of cheese, worth £8,069, was imported, in
1894 only 65,720 lb. were brought in, its value being
£1,543. For this result the travelling dairy may be
ascribed much of the praise; for as a result of its opera-
tions not only has the output been stimulated but a more
perfect system of working has been initiated. The
travelling dairy has still a most extensive field for
operation.


THE PURCHASED LAND.
See Map showing Land Purchased under “ The Agricultural Lands
Purchase Act of 1894” at end [attached).
In an article published in 1888 the following signifi-
cant passage occurs : —“ The Darling Downs are only a
small portion of the lands of the colony, but they possess
so many and so great advantages that their loss to close
settlement, even if it be only for a time, is a matter for
deep regret. They contain some of the finest alluvial plains
in the world, with rich black soil to an indefinite depth,
with no timber needed to be cleared away before the imple-
ments of agriculture can be used; they are fairly well
watered, and have a climate better even than the climate
generally, owing to their considerable elevation above the
sea-level. Add to all these things that they are within
reasonable distance of Brisbane, as the market of agricultural
produce, and the costly Government railways now traverse
these downs for hundreds of miles in different directions.
These railways run for the most part through large
freehold pastoral estates, and neither the land nor the
railways are doing what they are capable of —they are not
devoted to the work and service of close thriving agricul-
tural settlement.” As a corrective of this wholesale
monopoly the Land Act of 1884 was passed. The absolute
remedy for the trouble already caused came ten years later
m the shape of the Agricultural Lands Purchase Act.
The central idea of the 1884 Act was the prevention of
reckless alienation of land in favour of closer settlement
by means of long leases for grazing farms on easy terms
to hand fide settlers. The Act of 1894 has for its object
the reopening of some of the land locked up prior to
1884 to the small man on such terms as the practical
farmer can afford. Briefly, the conditions attaching
to selections are continuous residence; the lease period
is twenty years, the rent being equal to £7 12s. lOd. for
each £IOO of the purchasing price. These payments, if
continued for the twenty years, will extinguish principal
and interest, which is charged at the rate of 5 per cent,
per annum. So far, 27,000 acres have been acquired by
the Crown from Glengallan, North Toolburra, and West-
brook, and 6,160 acres from Eosewood Eun. The two first-
named are in the Warwick district, the third is in the Too-
woomba district, the fourth in the Ipswich, and all four are
among the earliest formed, as they certainly are included
in the finest station properties in the country. The acquired
lands on the Downs are typical of the whole of the Darling
Downs, which have been described as the “ Paradise of
Queensland.” Visitors to the colony have, unsolicited,
expressed their astonishment at their wealth-yielding pro-
perties. The beautifully undulating district is almost
encircled —save for the outlet to the Western plains —by a
belt of mountainous country forming a somewhat elevated
basin which has evidently in bygone ages been filled in by a
strong black alluvial deposit caused by decayed vegetable
matter and the denudation of the mountains. Prom these
mountain heights which, previous to the filling up of the


valleys, must have stood out in solemn grandeur, numerous
rivers and rivulets now derive their source, and wind
through the picturesque tree-dotted plains. The first
sight of this country must have gladdened the hearts of
pioneer pastoralists, who during the days of early settle-
ment took up the land in large areas —days when the
squatting industry was of paramount importance—when it
was considered an act of sacrilege to put an acre of land
under the plough. During the last half-century, however,
circumstances have completely altered the case. The
majority of the large areas originally acquired under
liberal land laws yet remain intact, but now as freeholds,
which extend up to the very threshold of the many towns
and villages with which the Downs country is studded.
The chief merit of the Downs land, as of that in
the Lockyer, lies in its proximity to the markets.
There are thousands and thousands of acres of excellent
agricultural land way hack. Their utilisation for any-
thing but pastoral occupation for many years to come
is not, however, probable, because of their isolated
position. Darling Downs might be absolutely lost in
one corner of the vast plains which are no longer water-
less tracts, and which form the South-western and North-
western portions of the colony. True, their praises are
not often sung, but this is because they are not often
seen—not because they have nothing worthy of praise.
The traveller can for days and days traverse the table-
lands, with their level or gently undulating plains
stretching away like the vast prairies of America to
the illimitable horizon, and covered with a luxurious
growth of nutritious grasses. But to return to the
Darling Downs. It may be remarked that their
excellence dwells not alone in the minds of Queens-
landers. “Bruin,” a Yictorian journalist of repute,
describing them, wrote: —“ There is no portion of the
great colony of Queensland that more delights the eye of
the farmer and grazier than the large extent of fertile
country known far and wide as the Darling Downs. With
a climate resembling that of Italy, and a soil that, over a
great area, rivals the far-famed potato land of Warrnam-
bool, there must be a great future in reserve for this
splendid district when its abundant natural resources are
properly developed. When, a good many years ago, I first
saw the Darling Downs, I came to the conclusion that the
district was admirably fitted to become the granary of
Southern Queensland, and a fattening ground where vast
numbers of sheep and cattle would be topped up for the
local market and for exportation. This impression was
strengthened by a second visit to the locality, when
I had the opportunity of making a closer inspection of
the country.” The Darling Downs district comprises
over 4,000,000 acres of magnificent soil, the bulk of
which is first-class agricultural land. “ It is,” says a
recent visitor from a neighbouring colony, “ a vast pasturage
encircled by mountains and encompassed by belts of
richly-timbered scrubs. It is an enormously fertile dis-
trict, showing a wealth of vegetation probably unsurpassed
in the world. At present it is a great wheat, lucerne, and


corn country—the home also of stud sheep arnd cattle and
famous horses ; but it is prominently a dairying and fruit
district. M uch of the very best land on the Downs still
remains demoted to grazing ; sheep and cattle walks obtain
where there should be cultivated farms. But the breaking
up of the large freeholds is merely a question of time. In
the near future the Downs will be the home of millions,
for there are openings in this fertile region probably
unequalled in any other part of Australia or America for
working farmers of small means.”
As has already been explained, the Agricultural
Lands Purchase Act is the key with which these lands are
to be opened. However, to continue the quotation : “On
its fertile uplands sheep and cattle lie in pleasant content-
ment, the streams gurgle in merry tune, and the birds pipe
melodiously. The barns of the farmers, as a rule, are
choked with the produce of the well-cultivated earth, the
reward of honest industry. The fields are mantled with
green grass, through which gay wild flowers peep, and over
all the land is rest, peace, and plenty. It is impossible for
anyone to visit the Downs towards the close of the year
without being entranced by the glorious beauty of the
undulating plains and the little hills. The Downs carries
2,500,000 sheep and 200,000 cattle, besides a large number
of pigs, the breeding of which has of late engaged the
attention of the farmers. About 80,000 acres are under
close cultivation, held in farms of from 5 to 300 acres.
Extensive coal deposits have been found in various parts
of the district. There is no lack of railway communica-
tion ; the main Southern line to the New South Wales
border, and the main Western line to Charleville intersect
the district, and there are branch lines to Pittsworth,
Crow’s Nest, and Killarney. It is hardly possible to
exaggerate the excellency of the climate; taken all round,
the Downs is far and away the healthiest place in Queens-
land, if not in Australia.” Sufficient has perhaps been
said to show that the Government were well warranted in
their choice of district in which to try their much-desired
experiment. Now to deal with the estates.
NORTH TOOLBURRA.
This estate is prettily situated about seven miles to the
northward of Warwick, and overlooks the river Condamine,
which forms the southern boundary of nearly the wffiole
property. There are in it in all about 23,000 acres of free-
hold land. It was formerly a portion of the old Talgai run,
but it was purchased by the late Mr. T. Coutts, some thirty
years ago, from Messrs. Hood and Douglas, who formed
it in 1852. The present proprietor bought out his relatives,
and now works the estate for sheep and cattle grazing
purposes, the flocks and herds being of a good useful type,
the cattle especially so. The main Southern Railway runs
through the eastern portion of the property, which is undu-
lating and has the appearance of having at one time been
stoutly timbered. Within the last ten years, however, nearly
the whole of the wooded country has been ringbarked, which
of course greatly added to the stock-carrying capacity of

the iestate. The paddocks that were formerly heavily
timbered have now a beautifully clear appearance, except
where some hugh spectral eucalyptus giants stand out in
grim solemnity as an indication of the strength of the
soil. The North Toolburra railway siding has been
erected where, in the primeval days, the timber grew
thickest. Looking north-west from North Toolburra
House and across a treeless valley, a long apple-tree ridge
is observed, showing out bright and green in the distance,
and gently rising from the level of the plain. Along the
summit of the ridge a main road leads from the farming
settlements of the Lower Condamine to Hendon railway
station, one of the important stopping-places between
Toowoomba and Warwick. Following down the view, but
in a south-westerly direction, the tortuous and tree-fringed
course of the Condamine is easily traced. On the right-
hand side of the river is observed the North Toolburra
meadow lands nicely sheltered amidst hills and woodlands,
and profusely covered with long waving grass. It is from
here that the Government have selected the greater por-
tion of the 11,000 acres repurchased. In the opposite
direction a glimpse is obtained of what may be described
as the eastern end of N orth Toolburra run, with the rail-
way line crossing Glengallan Creek. From Toolburra
House a fairly good view of the higher portions of War-
wick is obtained, and two or three miles across the river
are seen the snug and compact farms and vineyards of
Sandy Creek, one of the principal farming settlements in
the neighbourhood of Warwick.
The productive qualities of the land are everywhere
apparent about North Toolburra House, for its well-
arranged garden is adorned with fruit and ornamental
trees. The grape thrives especially well, and the growth
of oranges and Lisbon lemons is as vigorous as if these
trees were indigenous to the country, while Australian native
pines flourish luxuriantly. Dealing more particularly with
the meadow lands, it may be said that this portion of the
estate consists of a strip of land some eighteen miles long
by about two in width, nearly the whole of which is
admirably suited and ready for the plough. The principal
portion, however, is contained within a long treeless valley,
which is but a continuation of the Glengallan meadow
lands, trom which the Government have also made a large
purchase. The whole of this valley is watered by Glen-
gallan Creek, which has its source in the mountain range
near Mount Dumaresq, and strikes into the Condamine
Fiver some four miles below Toolburra House. The strong
pasture on these lands is very noticeable; indeed, when
diverging from the beaten track, some ditflculty is experienced
in riding through the long thick grass. The large-framed
Toolburra sheep are scarcely observable owing to the
length and fulness of the grass. The whole of this rich
valley is filled with the usual strong deposit of black alluvial
soil, which appears to be practically inexhaustible. A top
dressing of lime washing is clearly seen throughout, and
small fragmentary pieces of limestone are grouped
together, especially near the lagoons and watercourses.
The estate is excellently watered, not only by the Conda-


mine Eiver and Glengallan Creek, but also by three or
four miniature lakes or lagoons. Besides this supply it
is believed that an abundance of fresh water could be
easily obtained by sinking to a depth of about 15 feet
in any portion of the valley, the capabilities of which are
strikingly testified to by the cultivation paddocks, and
their wealth of sweet-smelling lucerne hay. The estate is
160 miles by rail from Brisbane, being tapped by the
Southern railway system, which, as already explained,
runs right through its eastern boundary. The 11,000 acres
which have been purchased are so shaped that many of
the subdivisions will have a frontage to permanent water
either from the Condamine Eiver or from Glengallan Creek.
Thus it follows that the land embraces a large percentage
of river flats suitable for lucerne growing, and sloping
backwards from the river into sound timbered uplands
well fitted for dairy runs.
The whole of the flats on the frontage could be
irrigated at a small cost, there being an abundant reserve
of water, and the “ lay ” of the country being such as to
permit of easy and effective distribution. There are butter
factories at Warwick and Allora, within reach of the
Toolburra lands by road and rail. There are two railway
stations on the estate. The average annual rainfall for
the twenty years ended 1893 was nearly 29 inches.
The following table gives the average yield of the
principal crops in the district, and the average prices
realised for the five years from 1890 to 1894, inclusive :
Average Yield per Acre. Average Price.
Wheat ... 17’27 bushels ... 3s. 7d. per bushel
Oats ... 21‘80 „ ... 3s. 3d. „
Maize ... 30‘45 „ ... 2s. 9|d. „
Lucerne ... l - 62 tons ... £3 4s. sd. per ton.
The railage rates to Brisbane are—for grain, about 11s. 6d.
per ton; for other agricultural produce, about 14s. per
ton; for butter and cheese, 14s. per ton.
GLENGALLAN.
The features of Glengallan are none the less attractive;
indeed, it may be described as a continuation of Tool-
burra. With Westbrook, the land is among the very
best comprised in the 4,000,000 acres which form the
Darling Downs. The station is itself in every respect a
model one, and is admittedly one of the best managed and
most compact in Southern Queensland. It comprises an
extent of 40,000 acres, all freehold. The estate is
pleasantly situated, the homestead being some seven miles
from Warwick, while the southern boundary of the pro-
perty comes within three miles of that important town.
The country is lightly timbered, beautifully undulating,
and shows a great wealth of rolling and strongly grassed
downs. One of the valleys, comprising the most central
portion of the property, extends from near the foot of
Mount Dumaresq for about twelve miles in a westerly
direction, and is divided into two about equal parts
by Glengallan Creek, a small fast-flowing and permanent
stream, its course marked by many handsome weeping


willows and acacias which grow upon its banks. The
Glengallan valley carries the impress of a strong volcanic
“ wash,” the gritty nature of the soil being a distinctive
feature in this part of the country. Bor about a
mile on each side of the creek are some rich loamy flats
of a friable nature, and easily worked. On each side
of the creek are broad acres of prairie grass and
lucerne. The uplands are topped with fairly open growths
of boxwood and apple-tree. The estate has been culti-
vated for some years with marked success. A total of
3,600 acres is now under artificial pasturage, and the area
is being annually increased to the extent of 500 or perhaps
even 1,000 acres. Farming operations at Glengallan are
of an extensive order. Prairie grass haystacks are
to be observed all over the cultivated fields. A
remarkable feature on the estate is the comparative
ease and certainty with which a supply of artificial water
is obtained. From wells sunk from 20 feet to s_o feet
deep an inexhaustible supply is drawn, and similar supplies
could be so obtained in every paddock on the property.
Dairying is an important part of the work of this model
estate. Those farmers who are fortunate enough in obtain-
ing selections on it will have, in the way the dairies are
managed, an excellent example. From the cowyards to
the dairy everything is worked in a scrupulously clean
manner. The milking-yards are paved with wood cubes,
the sliding bars of the cowbails are worked by an auto-
matic labour-saving appliance, and a small tramway
connects the milking-sheds with the dairy. Here a large-
sized cream separator is at work, the cream being sent
daily to the Allora creamery.
Of the 40,000 acres comprised in Glengallan the
Government have purchased 6,270 acres. About half of
the repurchased land has frontage to the Condamine
Eiver; some of it has frontage to the railway, and the
whole of it is within four miles of Warwick. The bulk
of it is fit for the plough, and is first-class agricultural
country. It is all within easy reach of the butter factory
at Warwick. The railage rates to Brisbane are a few
pence per ton per mile more than from Toolburra. The
average rainfall (twenty years) is 2878 inches per annum.
The average yield and prices realised were as already stated
in connection with the North Toolburra lands. The Glen-
gallan lands adjoin the finest farming areas in the Warwick
district, which is one of the principal centres of agricultural
activity in the colony.
WESTBROOK ESTATE.
In dealing with the Westbrook estate, we get as it
were into another territory, for while both North Tool-
burra and Glengallan are in the Warwick district, West-
brook is situated near Toowoomba. At the same time the
character of the country practically remains the same.
Westbrook is one of the old Darling Downs squattages,
which, as most people know, constitute the pick of the
country. It is within seven hours’ journey from Brisbane,
being only about 120 miles off the capital and only eleven
miles by road from its town centre —Toowoomba ; the


Part of the Westbrook Lands.


railway line, in fact, cuts right through the estate, which
is the property of Sir Patrick Jennings. There is cer-
tainly not a more fertile spot in the whole of
Queensland than the country which surrounds it. The
genial climate —the keen atmosphere of the high table-
land being appreciably tempered by the warmer currents
from the lower coast regions—and the rich volcanic
soils constitute elements of success only found in pecu-
liarly favoured localities. Westbrook is well within the
sphere of both these influences, and the farmers already
settled in its vicinity are admittedly among the most
successful in the temperate division of the colony. The
rainfall is abundant and regular and well distributed, the
mean annual average being inches. The repurchased
land, which totals 9,886 acres, has really a double railway-
frontage, since the Western line to Charleville passes close
to its north-western boundary, while its southern boundary
practically touches the intercolonial system. Thus it is
most favourably situated, and is bound to excite eager
competition.
The railway rates to Brisbane are —For grain, 9s. lid.
per ton; for hay and chaff, about 12s. 6d. per ton,
and the same for butter and cheese, though smaller
quantities of this class of produce as well as for fruit
can be sent at remarkably cheap rates, as will be
seen by reference to a short article elsewhere dealing
more particularly with railway matters. The lands com-
prised in the estate consist of open plains and gentle
undulating slopes lightly timbered, chiefly with apple-tree
and gum-topped box. The soil is of volcanic character of
the richest description—black, red, and chocolate. It
is on the whole well watered, water being obtained from
small creeks, supplied by surface springs, and by sinking.
This sinking is a very inexpensive work, even if it is
needed at all, for excellent supplies are obtainable at from
16 feet to 20 feet. The natural grasses and herbage are
rich and fattening. For wheat-growing the land can
scarcely be excelled, as will be seen from the following
table,'which proves also that it is admirably adapted for
general agriculture: —
Average Yield per Acre. Average Price.
Maize ... 25T7 bushels ... 2s. Bd. per bushel
Wheat ... 17'91 ~ ... 3s. 6d. „
Oats ... 2TOO „ ... 3s. Id. „
Lucerne ... T 35 tons ... £3 3s. 6d. per ton
These averages are for the five years —1890 to 1895. On
the estate or in its immediate vicinity, too, may be seen
growing in perfection many kinds of fruits, including
oranges, lemons, mandarins, and all other useful sorts of
the citrus family; vines, figs, walnuts, olives, mulberries,
apples, pears, plums, peaches, apricots, and numerous other
stone fruits. In view of the proximity of the estate to
the great metropolitan market, and, consequently, to the
chief port of the colony, the land seems particularly
suited to the requirements of men with limited capital
and desirous of making a home for themselves on the
land.


It has been decided to throw open all these lands (with
the exception of Westbrook, which may be available about
March), on the 18th February, 1896. Should the results
attendant on this experiment warrant it, other lands of like
character will be purchased and made available. It is
intended, in short, to make the policy of recovering lands
suitable for close settlement in proximity to the principal
markets a continuous one, and it is hoped by these means
to gradually bring the best lands of the Moreton and
Downs districts under agricultural occupation. Recognis-
ing the necessities of the case, the Government are not
taking any action towards re-leasing of the runs in the
districts named for squattages, the terms of the existing
lease of which have expired.
ROSEWOOD.
The Rosewood purchase is very much nearer the
metropolis, and is by no means inferior to the three pre-
ceding acquisitions. The climatic conditions vary, however,
to such an extent as to* alter the growing capabilities of
the country somewhat, but this forms no drawback to the
farmer, while it widens the scope of the experiment which
the Government are bent on trying. The land has an area
of 6,160 acres, and forms part of the old Tarampa Run,
but now known as Rosewood. Tarampa was one of the
first stations in the district, and likewise one of the finest.
That part repurchased is on the main south-western rail-
road system, three miles or more of railway track forming
portion of its southern boundary. It is distant about 55
miles from Brisbane—or about half-way between Too-
woomba and the metropolis—Forest Hill Station being on
the land. It is located in the centre, as it were, of one of
the richest and most prolific agricultural districts of
Queensland. Indeed the Lockyer presents a perfect net-
work of never-failing watercourses, all branching out from
Lockyer Creek, which itself empties into the Brisbane.
Some of these creeks rise in the vicinity of the Main
Range, and all their banks and most of the intervening
country is formed of deep, rich, loamy soil. The district
is a thickly populated one, and sends into the metropolis
more produce, perhaps, than any other. The growing
capabilities, as has been mentioned, are less varied than
those of the land above the Main Range, but for general
agricultural produce the productiveness of the land is not
excelled anywhere. The repurchased area is well and
permanently watered by the Lockyer, Laidley, and Sandy
creeks, and forms part of the large cattle-walks which
stand as reminders of the days when populous centres
scarcely existed north of Sydney, and when sheep and
cattle breeding was almost alone the only avenue of
industry in this colony. It has long been urged that these
runs should be made available to the small farmer, for in
the Lockyer district the very large population which has
settled has absorbed most of the agricultural land, en-
hancing its value and forcing those with insufficient means
into the scrubs, long distances from railways or markets.
The first step has been taken to give to those who desire
to locate themselves on the land an opportunity to do so


under reasonable conditions, and there is no doubt tbe
departure made by the Government will be duly appre-
ciated. Tbe terms offered are such as will coincide with
tbe length of the “ small man’s ” pocket. The payment,
in fact, of £7 12s. lOd. per £IOO per annum, which in
twenty years extinguishes both principal and interest, does
not represent more than the interest alone levied on those
who have made their purchases from private land-owners.
The railway rates for agricultural produce from Forest
Hill to Brisbane are as follow : —All produce (except
hay, straw, and chaff), if sent in truck-loads, ss. per ton;
if forwarded in 1-ton lots, 7s. per ton. and for smaller
quantities, Bs. per ton. Hay, straw, and chaff are carried,
if sent in 1-ton lots or over, for 7s. per ton ; smaller
quantities at the rate of Bs. 2d. per ton.
HOW A FARM MAY BE OBTAINED.
To secure the intention of the legislature, that the
operations under the Act should involve no charge on tbe
Treasury, but that in each transaction the State should
recoup itself for its outlay, it has of course been necessary
to enact special provisions as to the manner in which the pur-
chased land should be offered to selection. Thus the general
land laws will only apply to them in regard to points not
specially provided for in the Act under which the lands
were repurchased —namely, the Agricultural Lands Pur-
chase Act. It is intended to make all lands acquired
under the provisions of the Act available for selection
under “ conditional” tenure, but the term of lease will be
twenty years instead of fifty years, as prescribed in the
case of lands taken up under the Act of 1881 and later
measures. The disqualifications imposed by the general
land laws will, however, apply to land dealt with under the
Agricultural Lands Purchase Act. That is to say, no
person that is not a British subject, or who is under the
age of eighteen years, or who seeks to acquire the land as
the agent, trustee, or servant of another will be allowed
to select; neither will a married woman unless holding an
order for judicial separation or protecting her separate
property. Any of these lands, however, that have remained
open to “ Conditional ” Selection for three months, and
have not been applied for, may be opened to “ Uncon-
ditional ” Selection, in which case none of above restric-
tions, except the first, will apply.
The price of each farm will be determined according
to its relative value. The Grovernment, after setting apart
sufficient for roads, reserves, townships, and other public
purposes, will add to the price paid by them for the
property a sum not greater than one-tenth of this cost to
recoup them for the numerous incidental expenses. In
other words, land which cost the Government, say,
£20,000, will cost the selectors £22,000. The rent to
be paid each year will, as has been stated, be equal to
£7 12s. lOd. for each £lOO of the proclaimed price. This
annual payment will, if continued for the twenty years,
extinguish both principal and interest, the interest charge
being 5 per cent, calculated on the balance remaining
unpaid at the end of each year. For example, for a farm


An Agricultural Homestead : Starting for Harvest.


valued at £lOO, tlie deposit to be paid with the application
to select will be £7 12s. lOd. —the first year’s rent —and
whatever amount is due for survey fee. At the end of the
first year there will thus be £92 7s. 2d, still unpaid, and
the interest on this sum at 5 per cent, will be £4 12s, 4d.
The second £7 12s. 10d., therefore, represents this interest
charge of £4 12s. 4d,, and allows £3 Os. 6d. to be devoted
to the reduction of the principal. In the same way it will
be seen that at the end of the second year the unpaid
principal will be £B9 6s. Bd.; and of that year’s payment
of £7 12s. 10d., £4 9s. 4d. will go to interest and £3 3s. 6d.
to further reduce the principal. And so, year by year, the
interest charge diminishes; and more of the rent being
consequently applied to reducing the principal, the debt
becomes extinguished at the termination of the twenty
years.
At least four weeks prior to the date upon which
applications to select lands under the Act may be lodged
at the district lands office the Governor in Council will
issue a proclamation notifying such date, and containing
a list of the farms to be made available, their respective
area and prices, as well as the maximum area which
any one person may acquire. As in all other cases,
applications to select must be signed by the applicant
himself, though they may be lodged by his duly qualified
attorney. In the case of simultaneous applications
priority will be determined by lot.
Upon the approval of an application for a “Condi-
tional” Selection by the Land Commissioner, and the
confirmation of such approval by the Land Board, the
selector will receive from the commissioner a license
to occupy, and within six months thereafter he must
enter into occupation. This occupation must be con-
tinuous during the entire term of the lease. It may
be performed by the selector in person or by his duly
appointed agent. Within five years from the commence-
ment of the term, or such extended period (not exceeding
two years) as the Land Board may under certain circum-
stances allow, the farm must be enclosed with a good and
substantial fence, or have improvements effected upon it
equal in value to the cost of such a fence. When these
improvements have been made, and the conditions of occu-
pation have been fulfilled for five years, the fee-simple of
the land may be acquired on payment of whatever balance
of principal there may be at the time remaining unpaid.
These conditions do not apply to Unconditional
Selections. All that is necessary to be done in these
cases is punctual payment of the rent; and fee-simple
may be acquired at any time by payment of balance of
rents due.


THE GRAZING FARM SYSTEM.
The departure made by the Queensland Government
in respect of grazing farms is undoubtedly the means by
which pastoral occupancy will be revolutionised. The
small man is undeniably coming to the front. The advan-
tages of this to the colony are already being felt.
The benefits which will accrue to the settlers are not
less notable. In the first place, additional revenue must
flow into the Treasury coffers ; in the second, the induce-
ments held out are such as will attract to Queensland a
highly-desirable class of colonists desirous to settle.
Although a very recent divergence from the beaten path
of pastoral tenancy, the accruing results are already mani-
festing themselves in the brisk competition for grazing
farms and the extensive nature which the new leaseholds are
assuming. The scheme has passed the dangerous experi-
mental stage. The latest departmental figures showing
the transactions of the year ending November, 1895, are
interesting in this connection. The statistics are con-
tained in a speech delivered in the House recently
by the Hon. the Minister for Lauds. He said: “Taking
the year from November to November, the conditional
and unconditional selections opened amounted to 415,928
acres; grazing farms, 6,17^,000 acres; grazing home-
steads, 693,00 u acres; being a total of 6,871,000 acres.
Deducting the area opened as both grazing farms and grazing
homesteads, 106,269 acres, we get a total of grazing farms
and grazing homesteads of 6,765,000, or a general total of
land opened from November to November of 7,181,405
acres. The area selected to 12th November, 1895, by
approved application amounted to 700 conditional selec-
tions of 155,800 acres; 221 unconditional selections of
81,800 acres ; being a total of 187,600 acres. One
hundred and ninety-one grazing farms amounted to
1,343,000 acres, and there were 79 grazing homesteads
of 178,000 acres, making a total of 1,523,000 acres ;
or a grand total of applications reported to date and
approved of, 1,710,600. I am told by the officers of the
Lands Department that that is the largest amount of
selection that has taken place. That consists of 921 con-
ditional and unconditional and 270 grazing farms and
homesteads.” This activity is not confined to any par-
ticular district, but may be said to be characteristic of the
whole colony. The success thus achieved has warranted
the Government in making further additions to the land
immediately available for selection. This, too, is spread
over the whole of the pastoral districts of Queensland.
Roma, iSurat, Cunnamulla, Charleville, Buudaberg, Glad-
stone, Rockhampton, Longreach, Winton —all these dis-
tricts figure prominently in the list of available country.
Resumed areas of runs are being subdivided in every place
where the quality of the land encourages the belief that it
is adapted for small holdings. In this way some of the
very finest grazing country is being thrown open.
Notably is this the case in the lands in the Winton district,
a brief outline of which will be given presently.


The method now being adopted by the Queensland
Government has claimed the significant attention in the
older colonies. Quite recently this colony has been visited
by two capable writers on pastoral matters. One of them
—-himself a practical grazier—dilating on theGrazingParm
System, offers the following observations :—“ The new
plan of dealing with the pastoral lands in the back
country has much to recommend, it. It provides an ex-
cellent opening for the energies of young men possessed
of a little capital and having a taste for pastoral
pursuits. It does not offer a rapid and easy means of
growing iich, nor must those who become the lessees of a
grazing farm be afraid of a rough life and plenty of hard
work. That the rough life and bard work will meet with
a good return may be fairly assumed by what has already
been accomplished on these grazing farms. The finest
sample of w r ool I have seen from Queensland w r as from
one of them.
“ During my trip in Queensland I chanced to meet
with several grazing farmers, some of whom were natives
°f Queensland, and, naturally enough, they were the most
successful. Some were from the old country, as fine a
stamp of young men as ever Britain sent forth since she
first swarmed to colonise the waste places of the earth.
Bar from repining at the rough life in the bush, those
with whom 1 spoke on the subject seemed to enjoy it. In
the resumed areas of the Queensland squatting runs there
are openings for any number of enterprising young men
who have sufficient pluck and energy to go out into the
wilderness and make homes for themselves. I cannot help
thinking that if the opportunities presented by these
grazing farms were well known throughout Great Britain,
a considerable number of most desirable colonists would
be drawn to the northern colony. There are any number
of young men in the mother land who are possessed of
sufficient means to establish themselves well on grazing
farms on the Western Downs, but whose means are
insufficient for them to enter iuto any profession or
business at home. It is said that a very large proportion
of these young men are eager to escape from the over-
civilisation of the old country, and to them roughing it in
the bush would not come at all irksome. A deal has
been made of the necessity that exists for the new comer
to obtain what is known as colonial experience, but I fancy
this is exaggerated. A twelvemonths’ knocking about on
a station, or, better still, on a successful grazing farm,
would be quite enough to give men of intelligence a
sufficient knowledge of the business to embark in it on
their own account.”
Briefly sketched, the underlying principles of the
' system are these:—Provision is made for the leasing
of grazing farms in areas extending to 20,000 acres,
the lease period of which runs up to thirty years. The
Lands Department fix the annual rent of the leaseholds
at a rate corresponding with the quality and position
of the land, per acre being the minimum. The rent
so fixed is subject to reassessment after the first ten years,
and subsequently at intervals of five years; but rent cannot


Le increased at any reassessment to more than 50 per cent,
above that for the period immediately preceding. Grazing
farms are taken up in the following manner;- The
applicant first obtains a license to occupy, which is not
transferable, but which may be exchanged for a lease tor
the balance of the term of thirty years as soon as the farm
is enclosed with a substantial fence. This must be done
within three years. When the lease is obtained the holding
may be transferred or mortgaged, or the farm may be
subdivided, or, wnth the consent of the Land Board, be
sublet. It is a condition, however, that the land must be
continuously occupied by the lessee or his agent for the
whole term of his lease. The cost of survey ranges from
about £2l for a farm of 2,SCO acres to about £65 for
one of the maximum area, and may be paid in five equal
annual instalments.
THE GRAZING HOMESTEAD SYSTEM.
In the outlying districts where stock-farming may be
said to be hereditary there is a large number of young
Queenslanders to whom agriculture is naturally dist asteful,
and who unavoidably lead a more or less nomadic life.
A result of the idea of settling this highly desirable class
of colonist in permanent homes is the Grazing Homestead
System.
The area of this smaller grazing farm must not exceed
2,560 acres. Concessions have been devised to meet all
possible cases. The residence conditions are such as will
enable carriers and others, whose avocations are incon-
sistent with continuous residence in one place, to fulfil the
requirements of the occupation clauses without incurring
the expense of paying an agent to do so. The maximum
rent for the first ten years is fd. an acre a year.
The clauses of the Act dealing with the question, of
improvements are also considerably modified in favour ot
the smaller holder, the intention being a closer grouping
of farms with a view to the establishment of State schools
and those other centres whicli the exigencies ot an ever-
improving home life demand. _ .
In all other respects the grazing homestead is prac-
tically a grazing farm. In both cases the name is li ey
to mislead as to the quality of the land comprised in the
areas opened to these classes of selection. ihe word
“ grazing ” refers rather to the size and tenure of the faun
than to its possibilities. In many instances a large P a “
of the land is agricultural, and the desire of the Lands
Department is to include in every farm an area capable or
producing fruit and vegetables for the selector and green
feed for his stock.
The intending selector should personally inspect his
future home, and no time can be better spent than in
doing so. Too much care cannot possibly be given to
the problem of choosing a site -where “ the hearthstone and
the boundary line” of a new family are to be established.
Haphazard choice in this matter is the bane of the
selector and of the Department. The Minister for Lands
is able and willing to aid in cases where there is a
temporary departure from normal conditions, but a man


endeavouring to settle himself on land unsuited to his
requirements is beyond human assistance.
THE WINTON LANDS.
And now as to the nature of the country available
as grazing farms. Deference has been made to the
Winton lands opened on the 7th December. As these are
typical of thousands of acres of other country offered, a
brief description of them may be given. The lots have for
their town centre Winton, from which the most distant
selection is forty miles. The majority of the farms are
virtually on the town boundary. This furthermost point
is Manuka Desumption, located on the main Hughenden-
Winton road, and ninety-two miles from Hughenden,
the present railway terminus. The immensely growing
trade of the district has impressed itself upon the
Government, members of which recently made a personal
visit through it, and are so convinced with its wealth-
yielding capabilities and splendid resources, that it has
been decided to immediately tap it with railway com-
munication. Plans, and book of reference have
been approved by Parliament for (55 miles of railway
starting from Hughenden and travelling towards Winton,
ending on Katandra—the run adjoining Manuka. Ihus
when the line is constructed some of the country comprised
in the forty-six portions offered will abut on iis terminus,
and none of it will be further distant than forty-five miles —
most of it well within that radius. These forty-six selec-
tions comprise an area of 846,000 acres excised from the
resumed parts of the well-known Yindex, Manuka,
Oondooroo, Elderslie, Sesbania, Ayrshire Downs, and
Bladensburg squattages. As several of these farms have
been selected since preparation of this pamphlet, and more
may subsequently be selected, it is important that intending
selectors, in order to prevent disappointment, should make
inquiry what particular lots are still open before taking
any steps towards selecting or inspection of the land.
YINDEX.
There are nine grazing farms mapped out on Yindex —
seven in portion A, and two in portion B—which is much
nearer Winton. Dealing with the last first, it may be said
that they each comprise 10,000 acres of w'ell-grassed open
downs and fairly well watered country,the ‘Western Diver
dividing. The water in the Western Diver generally lasts
six months, and, in addition, in the case of portion 1, Scott’s
Creek gives a supply sufficient to last four months. _ The
only timber may be said to be the coolibah, which fringes
the creek, and a little stunted whitewood on the rises of
the downs. It should be stated, too, that the main stock
route to' Muttaburra intersects the two portions. The
farms on portion A generally present more valuable
features. One, 2, and 3 aie on the dividing water-
shed between the Thomson and theDiamantina. They are
thus mostly high country, and are watered on the east of
the divide by Culloden Creek, which flows into the
Landsborough, and on the west by a tributary of K e shift's,
by Corkwood and Wardoo Creeks, which at different
points enter Mills’ Creek —the main watercourse. The
natural water, however, is of little value, though there are


good facilities for conserving. Portion 3is improved by a
large tank of about 25,000 cubic yards and a windmill
which pumps into'two 20,000 gallon tanks on a masonry
foundation, from which the water runs into troughs.
No. 4 is a remnant of about 3,300 acres —practically
unwatered. Nos. 5,6, and 7 are undoubtedly the best
homesteads on the resumption. The first two are watered
by Elizabeth Creek, an arm of Jesmine Creek, which
flows into Mills’ Creek, and the latter chiefly by Kennedy
Creek, also a tributary of Jesmine. The water in both
Elizabeth and Kennedy Creeks lasts six or seven months.
About the centre of No. 6 there is also a 20,000 cubic
yard dam. The whole of the seven selections comprise
open downs country grassed with Mitchell, Eiinders, and
blue grass.
MANUKA RESUMPTION.
There are also seven homesteads excised from Manuka
Resumption, which, as has already been stated, is close to
the terminus of the proposed railway. The whole of the
country is excellently grassed with Mitchell, Eiinders, and
blue grass along the creeks, and in addition has a per-
manent water supply. In all seasons the country will
safely carry a sheep to three acres. The lots are chiefly
20,000-acre blocks. Each lot is intersected by one or more
creeks, which, however, do not all carry permanent water.
No. 3 has a network of watercourses, as well as one dam
and three overshot dams which hold water for a long time.
The whole of the portions draw their supply from Mills’
Creek (the principal creek in the district), and Nesbitt’s
Creek, a tributary which, on the leasehold at all events,
has never been known to dry up. No. 4 has a dam with
an original excavation of 10,000 cubic yards, as well as an
overshot dam, and a third one in No. 1 south-east paddock,
but none of them are, according to report, permanent.
No. 5, in addition to Muriel Creek, has a waterhole in
Nesbitt’s Creek, giving a six months’ supply, while a well
275 feet deep yields 12,000 gallons raised by a whim into
troughing. Nos. G and 7 comprised country that has never
been used, and has good facilities for conservation.
OONDOOROO.
The eight homesteads thrown open on Oondooroo
Resumption resemble in some respects Nos. 1 and 2 of
portion B on Yindex. They comprise open downs, well
grassed with Mitchell, blue, and other grasses, with cooli-
bah along the creeks, and a little whitewood here and there
on the downs. The whole of the water, with the exception
of that on 6,7, and 8, may be said to be drawn from
Jesmine Creek, a dam in which, in No. 3 at least, has
never been known to fail. No. 1, which adjoins
Sesbania, and is separated from the other lots, has
a small tank which is not permanent, but which could
easily be so made. No. 2 has never been fenced or used,
and the water only lasts about two months, though there are
good facilities for conserving. The W allace Range, clothed
with open scrub, terminates in No. 2. In No. 3, which may
be said to abut on Mills’ Creek, the best natural water lasts


A Selector in a Small Way.


eight or nine months. There is a fine overshot dam, per-
manent in any season, with a smaller one that cannot be
so described. Portion 4 bas natural water lasting about
nine months, and in addition gets the backwater from the
dam in No. 3. Nos. 5,6, 7, and 8 have water lasting from
five to seven months, the latter having a large permanent
tank, and a small dam of little value. Through 6,7, and 8,
which are watered by Oondooroo and Harriet Creeks,
the main stock route to Muttaburra runs.
ELDERSLIE.
The four portions resumed from Elderslie form a block
of country intersected by the Western Eiver and the main
stock route from Eoulia to Winton, and located between
Winton and Collingwood, bordering on the latter tow rn-
ship. The country generally is open downs, well grassed
with Mitchell, blue, and Flinders grasses. Nos. I and 2
have fairly large patches of open gidya scrub, with coolibah
along the creek’s banks. No. 1 is watered by two tanks —
one in Wokingham Creek, originally of 9,000 cubic yards,
and one on the eastern boundary, originally of 12,000 cubic
yards —but both are probably silted up to some extent.
Nos. 2 and 3 are watered by the Western Eiver, which
lasts about nine months, and in the case of the latter one
almost valueless overshot dam. No. 4 comprises four pad-
docks. The woolshed paddock includes Whitewood out-
station of 4-roomed iron cottage, kitchen, and horse and
drafting yards. Water is backed into the woolshed pad-
dock by two stone overshot dams in the township paddock.
There are two dams in one of the other paddocks—one
much silted up and the other probably partly so. A per-
manent tank is sunk inMurdering Dam paddock,from which
water was carted to the out-station during the last drought
when the river had dried up.
AYRSHIRE DOWNS.
Ayrshire Downs and Sesbania resumptions are gene-
rally regarded as being among the best of the country now
thrown open in the Winton district. It, with that of
Elderslie, forms a strip of country which, running north-
east, terminates within three miles of Manuka Eesumption
boundary, and, consequently, not very far from the terminus
of the proposed railway. The six lots on Ayrshire
Downs are well improved for water, and consist of
fine open downs, well gi’assed with Mitchell, Flinders, and
blue grasses. With the exception of some few scattered
whitewood bushes and the coolibah along the creeks
there is no timber on the country. Nos. 1,2, and 3
are watered by a fine square tank of about 26,000 cubic
yards. As in the case of all the tanks on xiyrshire, this
tank is filled with a large pipe with a valve on the inner
end and running through the embankment. This allows
the tank to fill itself to a certain level, after which the
water is pumped over the embankment with a centrifugal
pump and portable engine into troughs. Teviot out-
station paddock is located in the north-western corner
of No. 4. It also has Top Teviot dam, originally of
14,173 cubic yards. Near the western boundary of No. 5


there is a stone overshot dam, as well as Mather’s dam
(originally 8,340 cubic yards), a horse paddock, and a
boundary rider’s iron hut. No. 6is watered by Working-
ham Creek, the waterholes of which last from nine to ten
months.
SESBANIA.
The greater part of Sesbania Resumption is country
that has never been used. Nos. 1,2, 3,4, 7,8, and 9 come
under this heading. Consequently it has never been
fenced. The w r ater is judged to last from two to six
months, but there are good facilities for conserving, and
if a bore were put down on No. 1 on Coriuda Creek the
trend of the creek is such that eight farms could be
permanently watered. In this connection it may safely
be assumed that a large supply of artesian water can be
obtained in all the country thrown open at depths from
2,700 to 3,500 feet It has been estimated that at present
rates a bore could be put down to a depth of 3,500 feet for,
say, £4,200, the contractor finding everything, and one yield-
ing a supply of 1,000,000 gallons would keep a running
stream for fifteen to twenty miles, according to the season
of the year. What has been said of the possibilities of
Sesbania in this respect is true to the same or lesser extent
of some of the other resumptions. No. 5 has some good
■waterholes in Corinda Creek, the best of which last about
nine months, and some of which could be made permanent
by overshot dams, stone being plentiful along the creek.
The same remarks apply to No. 6. In No. 10 there is a
fine lagoon near the southern boundary in a billaboug of
Werna Creek, the water lasting the greater part of the
year. No. 11 has a six months’ supply of natural water,
with a well yielding 12,000 gallons.
BLADENSBURG.
Little need be said of the one portion thrown open
on Bladensburg Resumption except that it is chiefly suited
for cattle. The country is well grassed, and the water in
Lydia Creek (a tributary of the Western River) is
estimated to last half the year with facilities for con-
servation.
OTHER LANDS AVAILABLE.
It is not necessary here to enumerate all the districts
in which land is available to the selector. The necessary
information is obtainable at any of the many land offices.
It is sufficient to say that during the present year consider-
ably over 7,000,000 acres have been thrown open, and
added to that already opened, and the land is available in
any of the divisions of the colony. In the Roma district
alone, which is within easy reach of the railway, there are
about 1,000,000 acres waiting to be taken up. This country
includes some really excellent grazing selections; and it
also comprises many fine agricultural farms within six
miles of the line. As will have been seen by a preceding
article, the Roma district forms an important section of


the _ granary of Queensland. The soil of the farms
awaiting selection is chiefly of that brown sandy loam
type, some of it covered with a thick scrub ; other of it is
fine open forest land. Its adaptability for wheat culture
has been proved by the last harvest results, which show
that although in some parts of the colony the crop has, in
common with the wheat districts of New South Wales
and Victoria, been a half one, the Roma returns have on
the whole been gratifying. It has been no uncommon
experience to find a Roma farmer taking his four ba^s—
that is, sixteen bushels—of wheat off every acre he has
under the cereal.
Then for those who desire to enter into tropical agri-
culture, there are the sugar and coffee lands of the North,
Large areas of Crown lands suitable for sugar-growing
are still available in the coastal districts. These available
lands are chiefly located on the Daintree River, running
thence north as far as Cape Tribulation, and from Mou-
rilyan south to the Hull River and Murray Creek. On
the high lands of the Daintree it may be mentioned the
country has been proved to be eminently suited to coffee
culture.; indeed the climatic conditions of Queensland
are such that the colony can accommodate any class or
land settlement.


QUEENSLAND’S WEALTH OF WATER.
The “ treeless waterless plains ” of the back country
are no longer the fertile source to the writer they were,
say, a decade ago. The picture of the weary traveller
who had left his horse to die, only to himself expire in the
agonising throes of thirst a few hours later, has often
been drawn in all its horribleness to give, as it were, a
melancholy lustre to a recital of fiction. And. if there
has been exaggeration it has been pardonable in the
light of the sufferings of men like Burke, Wills,
Kennedy, Leichhardt, and the host of others who,
searching for knowledge, have perished in the vast
expanse of the “ Never Never,” —leaving out of the
question the scores of rank and file w r ho have followed
them in an endeavour to win the territory to man-
kind. The silent, shelterless tracks have, however,
latterly been robbed of much of their terror. The
ingenuity of man, born of knowledge, has created many
an oasis on the illimitable plains. Springs of living water
have been tapped ; it now gushes forth to invigorate and
make available that w r hich was often useless. Nature
conquers Nature. In a few short years the dry tracts of
territory on which many men have left their bones, and
scores have lost their fortunes, have been irrigated by
never-failing rivulets. The very earth has been perforated,
and the wants of man and beast met, enabling droughts to
be fought and creating wealth to the State. And all this
within a decade ! Ten years ago the underground reser-
voirs of artesian water had, practically speaking, not been
explored. It was indeed by no means certain that any
practical results would accrue if such were done, although
scientific men made predictions. To-day, however, bores
aggregating about 100 miles in length, and sending
forth a daily yield of hundreds of millions of gallons, now
water the hundreds and hundreds of miles of country
known by the misnomer of “the Queensland bush.”
Private enterprise which tapped the water-bearing strata
on Thurulgoona in the South-western part of Queensland
about 1884, and the Government efforts put forth success-
fully at Barcaldine the following year, have stimulated
energy. In both districts, as in others, the initial bores
have been surrounded by a perfect network of others.
Indeed, from the Gulf of Carpentaria down to the western
border line to the northern boundary of New South
Wales, and extending well to the coastal country of this
colony, has the earth been pierced, to respond liberally.
The efforts which were made to demonstrate the
existence of artesian water are worth touching upon. Prior
to 1885 a private bore had, as has been said, been sunk
on Thurulgoona, with the result that a supply of 80,000
gallons were obtained at 1,290 feet. There are now eleven
bores on this property, the deepest one being 2,037 feet,
and the greatest yield 3,500,000 gallons per diem. The
Government may be said to have first taken the matter up


A Bore in the Far West.


in a practical way towards the end of 1885, when, on the
recommendation of the Hydraulic Engineer (Mr. J. B.
Henderson), who for two years before had been urging the
matter, they engaged a borer from America (Mr. Arnold).
On the arrival of this gentleman, Mr. Henderson, after
consulting the Government Geologist (Mr. Jack), fixed
upon Blackall as the site for the first effort, and the
diamond drill, which had been used unsuccessfully, was
for ever abandoned as far as the work of obtaining water
was concerned. The Hydraulic Engineer built a Penn-
sylvania walking beam oil rig machine, which, after trial in
Brisbane, was sent to Blackall. The depth was fixed at
2,500 feet, and it is worth mentioning that the basis of
operations then fixed has remained so ever since. Operations
were commenced in December, 1885, and in June, 1887, a
depth of 1,039 feet had been attained. It was then found
that the machine being worked by cable was not quite
satisfactory, and the bore was hung up with a view to its
being proceeded with when other machinery should be
procured. In the meantime the Government had been in
communication with Canadian and American well-drillers,
which resulted in Messrs. Longhead and William Wodley
coming over from Canada. The negotiations which
followed ended in each of these two gentlemen being given
a contract for 7,500 feet of boring. In Wodley’s work
was included the completion of the Blackall bore, and in
Loughead’s, the sinking of one at Barcaldine. Both
terminated successfully (the old Pennsylvanian rig being
converted by Wodley into a pole-tool machine); but
Longhead first attained the desired goal, for on the 17th
December, 1887, a good supply was tapped at 615 feet.
This depth was increased to 691 feet, at which the yield
given was 175,000 gallons per diem. Erom this small
beginning has the great artesian system been developed.


THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE.
This department, as its name suggests, has for its aim
the instruction in and the development of agriculture in
Queensland. As one of the most important branches of
the Lands Department, it exerts itself to obtain the latest
and most reliable data on which to found its operations in
the farming districts of the colony. It was instituted in
June, 1887. During the first years of its existence the
department occupied two small rooms in the Lands Office in
George street, Brisbane, but as the scope of its operations
became enlarged it was removed to its present position in
William street, in the buildings previously utilised as an
Immigration Depot. The present Under Secretary was
the first officer appointed, and may thus be said to have
organised the department. In 1890 Professor Shelton
arrived from America, he having been selected by the
Department of Agriculture at Washington, out of many
applicants for the position, at the request of the Queens-
land Government to engage a competent instructor in
the latest and most approved methods of agriculture.
The appointment was, in the first instance, for a fixed
period, but so greatly have the efforts of Professor
Shelton been appreciated that his appointment has been
twice renewed. A considerable change for the better
has come over the method of farming in Queensland
of recent years. The time and labour bestowed by
Professor Shelton have undoubtedly had a good deal to do
with this improvement, but particularly has he achieved
success in the growth of wheat. Conferences, in which
the Australian colonies have been represented, have been
held on the question of the rust in wheat, and experimental
stations have been established each year,-where different
varieties of wheat have been grown to ascertain the sorts
best suited to Queensland conditions. The experiments
have been in progress during the current year at six
stations—namely, Allora, Roma, Springsure, Clermont,
Hughenden, and Herberton. At Allora about 266
varieties were grown, and at Eoma 209; while at
each of the other stations twenty-four to thirty standard
sorts were tried. While an experiment covering a single
season is far from conclusive upon any point involved, the
experiments which have been made unmistakably indicate
that a large area of the grass lands of the colony are
amongst the best wTieat soils in the world.
Included in other prominent features of the depart-
ment are the State nurseries at Mackay and Kamerunga,
where new seeds and plants of economic value are tested,
acclimatised, and grown in quantities sufficient for distri-
bution to farmers in the different parts of Queensland.
The dairying industry is watched over also, and those
engaged in it are kept posted up in matters affecting their
welfare by the travelling dairy, which goes from settlement
to settlement equipped with a full staff competent to teach
the latest methods of butter and cheese making. This
dairy stops in each settlement to give instruction. The
revolution worked in respect of the dairying industry is
evidenced by the great reduction which has been made in
the importation of dairy products, which was alluded to
earlier in this pamphlet. In connection with the depart-
ment there are also a botanist and an entomologist.


THE CONDITIONS OF SELECTION.
AGRICULTURAL AREAS.
Where conditions vary, facilities for acquiring land must
alter. The agriculturist cannot, generally speaking, “ sit
down ” alongside the squatter, neither can the sugar-grower
fix his tent-pegs adjacent to the everyday dairy farmer.
At any rate there are very few places where this can be
done with profit. Consequently the land laws have had to
be framed with an eye to the special requirements of the
country possessing so many diverse features. Summarising
these laws they may be set out as follows: —The freehold
of agricultural farms in area varying up to 160 acres may
be acquired if occupied by the selector personally for
five years at 2s. 6d. per acre, payable in five annual
instalments. Thus the annual rent charge is 6d. per acre.
The survey fees are paid in like instalments. The only
condition beyond that of residence is the expenditure in
improvements of a sum equal to 10s. per acre.
Farms up to 1,280 acres may be obtained if occupied
by one lessee personally for five years, or by successive
lessees for ten years, the freehold price being from
15s. per acre; or if occupied by a resident agent they
ma y be acquired on a fifty years’ lease at from 3d. per
acre per annum. Where the condition of occupation has
been performed for five years by the continuous and bond
fide personal residence of one lessee, or for ten years by
successive lessees, tbe freehold may be secured on pay-
ment of the prescribed purchasing price. If the purchase
is made within twelve years from the commencement of
the term of the lease, the price will be that mentioned in
the proclamation which declares that land available for
selection; if the purchase is made after that period, the
price will be increased in proportion to the increase of rent
(if any) upon reassessment. The rent reserved under the
lease usually amounts to about 2-| per cent, on the
purchasing price, and all the rent paid during the period
of personal residence is counted as part of the purchase
money. Unconditional selection of the lastmeutioned
areas is permitted, but in this case the price runs from
20s. per acre, payable in twenty annual instalments.
GRAZING FARMS.
Similarly favourable terms are offered to the grazier.
Under the grazing farm selection clauses of the Act, a
thirty years’ lease of an area extending up to 20,000 acres
is obtainable at from id. per acre per annum. It is under
these clauses, it may be incidentally remarked, that the
Wiuton lands are being made available. Every acre of
land in this parcel is within reasonable distance of the sea-
board. This rent is subject to reassessment by the Land
Board —an independent tribunal—after the first ten years;
but provision is made preventing the increase of the rent
at any reassessment to more than 50 per cent, above that
for the period immediately preceding. The procedure may


be described thus: The applicant first obtains a license
to occupy, which is personal to the applicant, and is not
transferable, but may be exchanged for a lease for the
balance of the term of thirty years as soon as the farm is
enclosed with a substantial fence. This latter must be
done within three years. This lease may be transferred
or mortgaged, or the farm may be subdivided, or, with the
consent of the Land Board, be sublet. The land must be
continuously occupied- by the lessee or his agent for the
whole term of the lease, and cannot be made freehold. The
cost of survey, ranging from something like £2l for a farm
of 2,560 acres to about £65 for a farm of 20,000 —subject
to increase or decrese according to locality —may be paid
in five equal annual instalments.
GRAZING HOMESTEADS.
Grazing homesteads differ somewhat. In the’ first
place, the maximum area that can be taken up is 2,560
acres, and the rent ranges from to fd. per acre per
annum. The lease period, however, remains unaltered —
namely, thirty years. The following special provisions in
regard to the taking up of grazing homesteads are sum-
marised by the Department thus : —“ The selector must
occupy the land by his personal continuous and bond fide
residence thereon for not less than six consecutive months
in each year during the first ten years of the term of the
lease, and thereafter throughout each year by the bond fide
residence of himself personally or of his registered agent.
The lease cannot be transferred during the first ten years
of the term, except in the case of the death of the lessee.
Under license from the Land Board the selectors of two or
more grazing homesteads may co-operate to work their
holdings as a whole, and will then only be required to
fence the external boundaries of the whole area; and
personal residence by one-half the whole number of
selectors will fulfil the condition of occupation.”
VILLAGE SETTLEMENT.
In addition to these modes of taking up land, pro-
vision is made for the settlement of small communities or
villages, each settler having an allotment not exceeding 1 acre
in area, and with farms of 80 acres each in close proximity
to the residential plots. Generally speaking, the freehold
of these farms may be secured on "the same terms as in the
case of agricultural farms not exceeding 160 acres in area,
with the additional privileges, however, that residence .on
the 1-acre allotment in the township is held to be equiva-
lent to residence on the farm, and one-fifth of the
required improvements can be made on the allotment.
It is also possible to establish what are known as co-
operative selections. Under the provisions relating to
this class of settlement, two or more selectors of agri-
cultural farms described as not to exceed 160 acres each,
may associate for mutual assistance under special license
from the Land Board. A selector may perform conditions
of residence for himself and any other member or members
of the association, provided that at least one selector is
in actual occupation for every 320 acres ; and if more than


10s. per acre s spent on permanent improvements on any
one farm, the surplus may be credited to any other farm
or farms in the group.
OCCUPATION LICENSE.
If a more limited tenure is desired it may be obtained
under what is known as an occupation license. The
tenancy of an occupation license expires on the 31st
December of each year, but may be renewed from year to
year by payment on or before 30th September of another
year’s rent, A license is determinable at the end of any
year by six months’ notice previously given to the licensee
by the Minister for Lands.
HINTS AS TO PROCEDURE.
Having noted generally the terms on which land is
available to the selector, it may not be out of place to indi-
cate the procedure. At the outset let it be stated the
application forms are obtainable at every land office in the
colony. All the necessary forms have to be signed by
the applicant himself, though they may be lodged by his
attorney, whose power, however, must be set out in the
proper form. For the benefit of intending selectors the
following draft power of attorney has been prepared by the
Department:— 1
Know all men by these presents that I, ,
, do hereby appoint , of ,
m 7 f r u e and lawful attorney, for me and in my name to lodge
with the Land Agent at applications made by me
for the selection of lands under the laws now in force; to sign
the entry of such applications in the Register of Applications;
to appear for me and on my behalf at any Land Court in
respect of lands so applied for; and generally to act for me in
respect of applications so made and selections so applied for as
I might or could do if personally present.
As witness my hand at this day
of , 18 .
Signed by the said 1
in my presence. 3
Accompanying applications for land, there must be
lodged with the Land Agent a deposit of one year’s rent
and one-fifth of the survey fee on the selection, it being
payable in five annual instalments. The survey fee on
unconditional selections, however, must be paid in full.
The applicant or his attorney must attend the Land
Court, which is held once a month, and at which the
application is dealt with by the Commissioner, who
announces his approval if there is no competition for the
particular lot. If there happens to be competition, the
lot must be balloted for in the case of conditional, or, if
unconditional, the rent is determined by auction ; in both
cases, of course, the simultaneous applicants only com-
peting. If the land applied for has been surveyed, con-
firmation by the Land Board follows very quickly. Then
the Commissioner gives the necessary license to occupy,
and, of course, the selector may at once enter into
possession.


If the land has not been surveyed it must be before
the Board will confirm the Commissioner’s approval, so
that in these cases there may be some little delay. Belay
seldom occurs, however, and the Department makes
every exertion to enable the selector to occupy the land as
soon as possible.
These, briefly, are terms on which land is available, and
the means to the end. There is perhaps much more that
the selector requires to know. But more detailed infor-
mation can readily be obtained at any of the Land Agents’
offices which are scattered over the length and breadth of
the colony in every centre. Specially written pamphlets
have been printed by the Government for gratuitous
circulation, to say nothing of the many maps and Bulletins
(the latter prepared by Government experts) issued from
the various State departments.

THINGrS TO BE REMEMBERED BY SELECTORS.
That office hours observed at all land offices are from
10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
That applications may be lodged between these hours
on each week day except Saturday, when offices close at
noon.
That applications to select take priority by time at
which lodged ; therefore applications should be in at
10 o’clock punctually on the day on which the land is
thrown open.
That all applications for land must be made on three
similar forms, each, being signed by the applicant himself
in his full Christian and surname. They may, however,
be lodged by the applicant’s agent.
That with each application there must be tendered to
the land agent the amount of the first year’s rent and
one-fifth of the survey fee, except in case of uncon-
ditional selections, when the whole survey fee must
be paid.
That when unsurveyed land is applied for, the boun-
daries have to be clearly described on the back of the
application form ; and on the ground the starting-point
has to be indicated by a tree or post at least 6 inches in
diameter and not less than 3 feet above the ground.
That, except in cases where the land applied for
comprises the whole of the Crown land available for
selection, the maximum breadth of frontage to a main
watercourse or main road is fixed at one-half the depth
thereto.
That for unsurveyed portions desired for agricultural
farms the printed form known as El must be used ; for
grazing farms, El. Eor surveyed portions, or a portion
mapped out under the 44th section of “ The Crown
Lands Act of 1884,” Eorm E is used in the case of
agricultural, and Eorm E in the case of grazing farms.
That persons under eighteen years of age, and married
women who have not obtained a judicial separation or pro-
tection order, can only acquire unconditional selections.
That conditional selectors have priority over uncon-
ditional selectors when the same land is applied for
simultaneously, and is open to both class of selectors.
That if two or more applicants tender simultaneously
for conditional selections, priority is determined by ballot;
in the case of unconditional selections by auction.
That all agents appearing for applicants must be armed
with the necessary power of attorney, a draft of which is
given in another part of this pamphlet.
That when residential conditions cannot be fulfilled
by the selector, he may be represented by a registered
bailiff.
That it is imperative that bailiffs must themselves be
qualified to select land.
That all bailiffs’ agreements must be lodged with the
Commissioner within one calendar month from the date of
making.
That when it is desired to appoint a bailiff the agree-
ment in duplicate, and bearing a 2s. 6d. stamp, must be
forwarded to the Commissioner.


That in the event of a female selector marrying, she
retains her holding as her separate property.
That if her marriage tabes place after the expiration
of six months from the commencement of the lease, and if
her husband is the lessee of an agricultural farm riot exceed-
ing 160 acres in the same or adjoining district, the Land
Board may allow the condition of occupation in respect of
both holdings to be performed by the residence of the
husband or wife on either of the holdings for such part
of the term as it thinks fit. Such allowance may be
retrospective.
That fifteen days’ notice prior to the sitting of the court
is required by the Commissioner of selectors applying for
certificates of fulfilment of conditions.
That proof forms to accompany the notice must be in
duplicate, and declared to by two disinterested witnesses
before a justice of the peace.
That licenses are inoperative on the failure of holders
of agricultural or grazing farms to apply for a lease
within the periods of five years or three years from the
license dates, as the case may be.
That holders will, in this event, have no further right
or title to the land unless they obtain from the Land
Board licenses extending the time for the completion of
their improvements, which in no case are permitted to
exceed a period of two years.
That it will facilitate matters very much if applicants
for opening lands to selection, offering land for sale by
auction, &c., would in the first instance make application
to the Land Commissioner of the district, who will then
forward their applications with the necessary report to
the Under Secretary for Public Lands, Brisbane, for
consideration.
That all communications intended for the Head
Office should be addressed to The Under Secretary for
Public Lands, Brisbane, from whom they will receive
careful consideration and prompt attention.


MILWAY FACILITIES.
The relationship of railways to land settlement is
close. The two may he said to go hand in hand; and it
follows that neither should be subordinate to the other.
"Without facilities for reaching a market the agriculturist,
the selector, and even the squatter is practically helpless;
for though he may of course administer to his own wants,
as a contributor to the wealth of the country he is a failure.
In Queensland the railway question is an interesting study,
furnishing as it does an index to the general progress of the
colony. Much of the general progress is wrapped up in the
development of railway construction. The ruthless invasion
of the iron horse into the tropical jungle of the North ;
its piercing of the mountain range which in the South
separates the territory revealed to the white man by
Allan Cunningham and settled by pioneers of the Leslie
type ; its penetration into the undulating grass-clad
plains which lie to the westward of the Drummond Range
—each has its own place in the annals of Queensland.
But in these days of commercial expansion and trade
development people seldom ponder o’er the past. Perhaps
it is because it does not pay. In any case they have little
time. With them it is the present and the immediate
future. The ever-domiuant aim is to make use of and
extend the means at command —means which have aided
so materially in creating the present. What people now
desire to be told is not what things were, but what they
are, and how, if they avail themsqlves of the facilities
already provided, those facilities will fit in with their
particular calling or proposals. Still, stability and per-
manence are two important factors; and, after all, the
extent to which these have been attained in the Queensland
railway system cannot better be judged than by a com-
parison of existing and previously existing conditions.
Under these circumstances a few figures, indicating the
progress made in railway construction, will be interesting,
and as such form a fitting prelude to others of greater
importance to the intending settler.
Railways were inaugurated in Queensland just thirty
years ago —in 1865 —in which year there were only twenty-
one miles of line open. The pioneer track was in the
Southern division of the colony, the twenty-one miles of
rails running from Ipswich Toowoombawards. Inci-
dentally it may be remarked that this railway was part of
a long-brewed scheme which had for its central object the
making of the present capital of Queensland of secondary
importance to Ipswich, which desired to be recognised as
the “ head of navigation.” The idea was that Ipswich
should be the great receiving depbt of the Western
country, the pastoral produce being transported from
the runs to the place by rail, thence by water to the
ships in Moreton Bay. For ten years nearly was the
iron horse kept from Brisbane, and the fight waged so
warmly on this account is to be counted among the most


exciting of past political warfare. The passengers carried
over these twenty-one miles of line in 1865 numbered 17,350,
and the goods traffic amounted to 2,982 tons, the total revenue
derived from both sources being £5,663. In 1875, when
the line through to Brisbane was opened, the mileage
(which included 53 miles in the Central division, the first 30
miles of which were opened in 1867) had run up to 263 miles,
yielding a return of £161,044, of which goods contributed
£97,142 (50,785 tons), and coaching traffic £63,902
(137,890 passengers). The next decade (1885) saw the
three great trunk systems which now bring the Western
country in touch with the coast well under way. The
Northern Railway, the first 34 miles of which had been
completed in 1880, had been extended 203 miles, the
Central had penetrated 390 miles of territory, while the
Southern had been run out 775 miles. Then, in addition,
31 miles of the Cooktown line and 30 miles of the Mackay
railway had been laid. The total mileage for 1885 was
1,429 miles, and over these 1,369,345 passengers and
543,347 tons of goods were carried, earning in all
£733,337. But great as this progress undoubtedly was,
the succeeding decade has eclipsed it. The three great
arms have themselves grown, and have sent out their
branches, which act as life-veins to the country
tapped, and as feeders to the main body. Altogether
2,379 miles of line are now laid, which earned during
the year ending June, 1895,. over £1,000,000, .repre-
senting over 2,000,000 passengers, and over 900,000
tons of goods. When the figures for 1896 will have
been made available, it is anticipated these results will
be found to be largely augmented. The rolling-stock,
which had been thought to be reasonably sufficient, has in
places proved to be quite inadequate to the demands made
upon it, and tenders have been called for the further
supply of locomotives and wagons, while the railway men
in the meantime are working night and day to cope with
the increased trade. And in this connection it is worth
mentioning that a large proportion of the rolling-stock,
including some of the locomotives, has been constructed in
the colony. The Government have, in fact, several work-
shops, with Ipswich as their centre, the whole railway
service utilising the labour of about 4,000 hands, of whom
412 are engaged in the shops. Parliamentary sanction
has been asked and given to further extend the Northern
and Southern systems, and to lay down several branches.
The two former, when completed, will secure to Queens-
land nearly the whole of the great wool trade of the South-
western and North-western portions of the colony, some of
which now finds its way to the railways of Queensland’s
neighbours. They will also greatly enhance the value of
the pastoral lands in those particular districts which have
recently been thrown open to the selector.
The whole aspect of the railway question betokens
permanency, and a pleasing feature in respect to it is the
rapid strides made in regard to the impetus it has given to
the development of the wool and live stock trade. Indeed
of the increased earnings of 1894-5 over those of 1893-4
(£69,765) the live stock traffic alone contributed nearly


Wool Teams on the Road


one-half. The other half was made up of £17,600 wool,
£10,073 general merchandise, £6,876 agricultural produce,
and £515 minerals. A comparison of the passenger traffic
shows that 30,000 more people made use of the train
service, though tnese being principally short distance
wayfarers, the increase is not regarded as a prominent
feature in the transactions.
But what is more significant in a study of the railway
position is the percentage of working expenses to gross
earnings. A comparison of these figures is interesting,
for though they may not be so favourable as have been
occasionally noted, they are much lower than have ruled
generally, and if the one or two lines (like the Cairns railway)
the earnings of which are eaten up by the interest charge or
the excessive construction cost were left out, they would
show a proportion unexcelled by any other existing system.
As it is, few excel in this respect. The percentage of working
expenses to gross earnings has been as high as 96’22, and
as low as 48'20. For 1895, however, it was 56 # 75, the
figures having shown a regular decline for the last seven
years, notwithstanding the costly lines mentioned. And
herein lies the importance of these things to the settler,
for when the great decrease which has been made in the
rates is considered in conjunction with the facts men-
tioned, it may fairly be assumed that the rates now levied
are a maximum quantity. Indeed, it would seem at any
rate that if the position improves in corresponding ratio,
even greater concessions may be afforded the settler than
now prevail. To enable those in other colonies to better
judge of this position a few illustrations as to the rates
charged may be given. Before touching on these, how-
ever, it may he remarked, as illustrating affairs as they
stood at the end of the financial years 1894 and 1895, that
although the train miles run during the later period were
augmented by over 343,000 miles, the net earnings per
train mile had risen from 2s. to 2s. 3fd.
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCE, &o.
And now as to rates. Dealing first with agricultural
produce, it may be said at the outset that the rates have
been framed to meet the requirements of the most humble
contributor to the country’s wealth. All produce (except-
ing hay, straw, and chaff, for which special rates are
charged) is, when forwarded in truckloads, charged at the
rate of Is. 3d, per ton for any distance from 1 to 10
miles. Dor every mile after the 10 miles Id. per mile may
be accepted as the basis of estimate. Thus for 50 miles,
4s. 7d. per ton would be charged; for 100 miles, Bs. 9d.
per ton, and so on. Although the carriage of flour,
bran, and pollard more intimately affects the manu-
facturer, it may incidentally be mentioned that it is
charged for at exactly the same rates when forwarded
in truckloads to ports. Produce forwarded in 1-ton
lots is subject to somewhat higher rates, and neces-
sarily so, because of the fact that half-loaded trains may
have to be drawn. For any distance from 1 to 10 miles,
2s. is charged, this being the minimum. The charge after
this varies somewhat, until it reaches 6s. for 50 miles,


11s. for 100 miles, 14s. 4d. for 150 miles, 17s. Bd. for
200 miles, 20s. 3d. for 250 miles, and 225. Bd. for 300 miles.
These same rates also rule for all hay, straw, and chaff,
whether sent in 1-ton lots or by the truckload. For
smaller quantities than 1 ton of agricultural produce,
including in this case hay, straw, and chaff, a slightly
higher charge is made, the reason for the increase being
obvious. Timber is similarly charged. The case of the
farmer who cannot even forward more than 1 cwt. to
market is generously met. Indeed, he is exceptionally
well-favoured, as will be seen from the following simple
table of minimum charges, which shows the rates and at
the same time affords a comparison with those levied in
the older colony of New South Wales. Certainly the
Queensland farmer has a good start of his southern
neighbour: —

The charge made for return empties is a nominal
one. In the case of empty milk and cream cans they are
transported free of charge.
LIVE STOCK.
Live stock may be deported in either four-wheeled,
six-wheeled, or eight-wheeled wagons and vans. The class
which may be taken as the medium of the rolling-stock,
however, are the six-wheeled vehicles, which are capable
of carrying twelve head in the case of cattle and 140 in
the case of sheep. Taking cattle first, trucks _ of the
capacity named can be forwarded the following distances
for the sums named :—SO miles, 315.; 100 miles, 605.;
125 miles, 725. 6d.; 150 miles, 855.; 175 miles, 975. 6d.;
200 miles, 110 s.; 225 miles, 120 s. 6d.; 250 miles, 1315.;
275 miles, 141 s. 6d.; 300 miles, 151 s. 6d. For sheep, the
rates for six-wheeled vans carrying 140 sheep are as
follow : —Fifty miles, 425.; 100 miles, 775. 6d.; 125 miles,
91s. 6d.; 150 miles, 1055.; 175 miles, 1195.; 200 miles,
1335.; 225 miles, 1425. 6d.; 250 miles, 1525. 6d.; 275
miles, 1625. 6d.; 300 miles, 1725. 6d. Where train loads
are forwarded, rebates on the following scale are made :
250 miles and under, 5 per cent.; 251 to 300 miles, 6 per
cent.; 301 to 350 miles, 7 per cent.; 351 to 400 miles,
9 per cent.; 401 to 450 miles, 12 per cent.; and any
distance over this number of miles, 15 per cent. Store
sheep and cattle, which are required to travel for grass or
water, may be conveyed at a reduction of 33-| per cent,
less than the ordinary rates. A concession is also made


25 miles and under

in respect of drovers. To these a return second class
free pass is issued on the basis of one for each 50 head of
cattle or horses, or 500 sheep, including a dog for each
drover; it being conditional that the drovers shall attend
the live stock during conveyance.
WOOL.
The rates for the carriage of wool cannot easily be
given in detail. It may be said, however, that the basis
for the clean wool starts from 6d. per ton per mile and
descends on a sliding scale to Id. per ton per mile. If the
wool is dumped, a rebate of 10 per cent, is allowed. If
the wool is greasy, the rebate is 20 per cent.; and if greasy
dumped, 25 per cent. It has been mentioned that some of
the trade of the far 'Western country finds its way on to
the railways of the other colonies. As a corrective of this,
special wool rates are in force for all such competitive
areas such as Thargomindah. All information is, however,
easily obtainable on application at any of the stations.
GENERAL MERCHANDISE.
The same difficulty presents itself in regard to general
merchandise. It will be sufficient for present purposes,
therefore, to say that the rates are divided into three
classes, in the framing of which the ad valorem principle
largely operates. The rates are based on a sliding scale,
in respect of distance, so that the further the goods are
carried, the less the cost of carriage per ton per mile works
out. For details it is advisable to secure a copy of the
classification from the Department.
SUGAR-CANE.
The rates for the conveyance of sugar-cane in full
truckloads vary according to locality, but as a guide the
following scale may be given
8 miles and under ... Is. 3d. per ton
9 miles to 20 miles ... l|d. per ton per mile added to the
rate for 8 miles, but not to exceed
2s. 3d. per ton.
Over 20 miles ... Id. per ton per niile added to 2s. 3d.,
the 20-mile rate
As remarked, special rates rule for localities not so
favourably situated as others.
POULTRY IN COOPS.
The Department provides coops, in which farmers
may forward their poultry, on a deposit being made for the
return of the conveniences. This deposit is, of course,
returned upon the coops being returned. Each coop
holds twelve pairs, and for the transport of each coop the
following charge is made ;
s. d.
76 to : 100 miles.... ... ... ~. 3 6
And 6d. for every 50 miles or part of 50 miles above 100
miles.


FROZEN MEAT.
The rates for frozen meat where refrigerating cars are
provided (the supply of ice being furnished by the con-
signor) are as follows : —lOO miles and under, 2-|d. per ton
per mile; 101 to 200 miles, 2d. per ton per mile added to
the rate for 100 miles ; and for distances over 200 miles,
Id. per ton per mile added to the rate for 200 miles. This
product cannot, however, be carried in less quantities than
6 tons. The products of meat preserving, boiling down,
and butchering establishments are carried at much the
same rates, but the minimum distance is 50 miles.
By Authority ; Edmund GREGORY, Government Printer, William street, Brisbane,
Sufficient has, perhaps, been said to furnish an idea as
to the cost of transporting products of the laud to market
and to ports. In conclusion, it should be remarked that,
so far as dairy products are concerned, facilities for cold
storage are now being provided at the metropolitan terminus
of the railway. The store, which is being erected as an
experiment, has a capacity of 200 tons ; and its completion
will necessarily alter the present conditions on which all
frozen products are carried, since the Department will
manufacture its own ice.
