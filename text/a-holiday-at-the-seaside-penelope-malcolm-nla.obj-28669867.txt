At last the great day had
arrived. Beverley, Johnnie and
their dog, Kola, were in the train
on their way to the seaside to
spend the holiday they had talked
and dreamed about for so long.
Palm Beach was crowded
when the train pulled in, and the
— children were very excited at their first
glimpse of the sea. There were crowds
of holiday makers on the beach, and
many boats bobbing up and down near the long pier. Their
Auntie was waiting to welcome them and drive them to her
home, where they were going to stay.
The children's eyes opened very wide when they saw the
ovely tea waiting for them, and Kola barked and wagged his
tail. He seemed to know there would be lots of nice things
for him, too.

Beverley behaved very well, and remembered all she
had been told before leaving home; but Johnnie forgot his
manners. He was very hungry, and did not* stop eating until
everything was gone. He was sorry afterwards, as he soon
had pains in his tummy and Auntie gave him a large spoonful
of oil. It was a long time before he could go to sleep.
Johnnie was well again the next morning, so Beverley
and he decided that they would put on their bathing gowns
and go for a walk along the seashore.
They collected a number of pretty shells in their buckets.
Kola, who had run ahead, started to bark fiercely, and
Beverley and Johnnie hurried to

Kola was sniffing around some rocks when all of a
sudden a big crab caught him by the nose and would not let go.

The poor dog was in great pain and
ran along the beach rubbing his nose in
the sand trying to get rid of the crab, but it was
not until he stumbled head-over-heels over a rock that
he was able to shake off the crab. By this time he was
tired of crabs, and was very glad to hurry back to the
children.
Johnnie then saw a little boat with prettily coloured
sails, floating in the shallow water, and he soon persuaded
Beverley to climb aboard and go for a sail with him. Kola
was frightened, but he did not want to be left behind, so he
clambered in, too. Johnnie pushed the boat into deeper
water and climbed in. The current and the wind soon carried
the boat away from the shore. The children were having a
wonderful time watching the fish swimming, and the seagulls
flying around the boat.

After some time, the
boat drew near to a beautiful
island, and the children in

their eagerness to reach the shore, capsized

were swimming nearby helped them to safety.
The Mermaids took Beverley and Johnnie
to their home, which was a big cave in the
rocks under the sea. The cave sparkled with
thousands of tiny lights and the floor was
covered with gorgeous seaweed, shells, and
coral, and there were many kinds of brightly
coloured fish swimming about. The children
were shown everything in
the cave, and met all

Another day, the children went for
a walk in the bush nearby. They saw a
lot of little bunnies running about, also
squirrels and prettily coloured birds playing
in the treejpps. _J<ola tried to join the
bunnies in their game, but they ran away to

Soon it began to get dark, so Mother

gathered around to say good-bye to the children,
and two of the bunnies went with them to make
sure they reached home safely
