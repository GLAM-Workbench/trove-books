GOVERNOR DIR G. F. BOWEN, G.C.M.G., to the EARL OF CARNARVON.
(Received May 6, 1876.)
Government House, Melbourne,
My Lord, March 7, 1876.
At. the request of my Responsible Advisers I have the honour to forward, and ,to
recommend to the favourable consideration of your Lordship, and of the . Lords Com-
missioners of , the Admiralty, the enclosed ministerial memorandum by, Sir James
McCulloch.
2. It will be seen that the object of this memorandum is to urge the importance of
issuing instructions that “Her Majesty’s ships shall visit, whenever practicable, the
“ groups of uninhabited or unfrequented islands which lie, more or less, on the outward
“ and homeward tracks of vessels trading between Great Britain and the Australasian
“ Colonies, in order that relief may be afforded to shipwrecked persons, should such be
“ found thereon.”
3. Sir James McCulloch further observes, that the recent “ discovery of a number of
“ persons, saved from the missing ship ‘ Strathmore,’on the Crozets (in the Southern
" Indian Ocean), after six month’s privation and suffering, coupled with the fact that at
“ least one other passenger vessel for Australia is now given up as lost, has invested this
“ subject with fresh and painful interest.”.
I have, &c.
The Right Hon. the Earl of;Carnarvon,. (Signed) ~G. F. BOWEN.

Enclosure in No. 1.
Memorandum for His Excellency the Governor.
(No. 566.)
Sir James McCulloch has the honour to submit to his Excellency the Governor that
it is advisable to communicate at the earliest opportunity with the Right Honourable
the Secretary of State for the Colonies, with a view to the issue of instructions to officers
commanding Her Majesty’s ships to visit, whenever practicable, the groups of unin-
habited or unfrequented islands which lie, more or less, in the outward aiid home-
ward tracks of vessels trading between Great Britain-and the Australasian Colonies,
in order that relief may be afforded to shipwrecked persons, should such be found
thereon.
His Excellency will probably recollect that ih 1868, after the rescue of the survivors
in the case of the “ General Grant,” which vessel was wrecked long previously on the
Auckland Islands, the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty were good enough to say,
in reply to a letter from the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce, that periodical visits
should in future be made by the ships on the Australian Station to the islands in the
neighbourhood of New Zealand. Whether the directions then given continue to be
observed this Government is not aware. In any case, no reference was made at that
time to the islands situated between the Gape of Good Hope and Australia, which late
events have shown to demand equal attention.
Recent telegraphic intelligence of the discovery of a number' of persons, saved from
the missing ship “ Strathmore,” on the “ Crozets,” after six months’ privation and suffer-
ing, coupled with the fact that at least one other passenger vessel for Australia is now
given up as lost, has invested .the subject with fresh and painful interest. Had it'been
the practice of Her Majesty’s ships to examine the “ Crozets ” and other islands in the
41658. Wt. 17488. A 2


Southern Indian Ocean when navigating those waters, it is more than probable that the
unfortunate persons alluded to would have been relieved from their distressing position
at a much earlier date, and possibly many lives would have been saved.
Sir James McCulloch, therefore, begs to request that his Excellency will be so good
as to write to Lord Carnarvon on the subject by the outgoing mail. He feels persuaded
that it has only to be brought under the notice of Her Majesty’s Government to ensure
immediate attention. It is suggested that ships of war should receive orders to make a
careful examination of the various islands when sailing in adjacent seas; and that the
officers commanding at the nearest naval stations shall cause like examinations to be
made by the ships at their disposal as frequently as the exigencies of the service will
permit.

Sir, Downing Street, May 15, 1876.
I am directed by the Earl of Carnarvon to transmit to you, for the consideration
of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, a copy of a Despatch from the Governor
of Victoria,* with a ministerial memorandum, urging the importance of issuing instructions
to the officers in command of Her Majesty’s ships to visit, whenever practicable, the
groups of uninhabited or unfrequented islands lying more or less on the outward

Colonies.

With reference to your letter of the 15th instant, f and the Despatch of the Go-
vernor of Victoria, in regard to the importance of Her Majesty’s ships visiting, whenever
practicable, the groups of uninhabited or unfrequented islands lying, more or less, on the
outward and homeward tracks of vessels trading between Great Britain and the Australian
Colonies, I am commanded by my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to request
you will state to the Earl of Carnarvon that their Lordships have already been in
communication with the Committee of Lloyd’s on this question.
2. I am also to forward, for his Lordship’s information, a copy of a letter addressed to
the Secretary at Lloyd’s on the 10th instant, stating the views of this Board on this
subject.
The Under Secretary of State for the Colonies, I am, &c.

Sir Admiralty, May 10, 1876.
With reference to your letter of the 3rd instant, drawing attention to the fact that
three first class ships, trading between Great Britain and Australia within the last nine
months, are unaccounted for, and requesting that one of Her Majesty’s ships should
visit from time to time the islands lying in the ordinary track of vessels making the
Australian voyage, or that one of the Australian squadron should be despatched on that
service, I am commanded by my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to acquaint
you, for information of the committee for managing the affairs at Lloyd’s, that with every
wish to meet their request, my Lords are unable to give directions for one of Her
Majesty’s ships on the Australian Station to search the outlying-islands, as they are quite
beyond the limits of the Australian command.
2. Orders, however, will be given for any vessel proceeding from the Gape of Good
Hope to Australia, when possible, to sight the Crozet Islands sufficiently near to examine
them.

3. In making this communication my Lords desire me to observe that it has come to
their knowledge that ships, in making the passage from this country to Australia, appear
to incur very great risk by going too far south, and making the run amongst icebergs
and floating ice, and that if this is the general practice their Lordships cannot feel
surprised at several vessels being now missing.
4. My Lords further desire me to call attention to the first page of the sixth edition
of the “ Australia Directory,” Vol. 1., which directs that, “ after rounding the Cape of
‘*‘ Good Hope, vessels bound to the south coast of Australia should run down their
“ longitude on or about the parallel of 39° S., where the winds blow almost constantly
“ from some western point, and seldom with more strength than will admit of carrying
“ sail. In a higher latitude the weather is .frequently more boisterous and stormy, and
“ sudden changes of wind, with squally wet weather, are almost constantly to be expected,
■“ especially in the winter season, and after passing the islands of St. Paul and
“ Amsterdam. Islands of ice have also been encountered in those regions, as was almost
“ fatally proved by Her Majesty’s ship ‘ Guardian ’ striking against one in latitude 46°
“or 47° S., and nearly foundering in the beginning of summer.”
I am also to draw your attention to the foot note on page 1 of the same work indicated
by an asterisk.

with transmitted, showing the late tracks of the steamship “ St. Blyth.”*

My Lord, Wellington, December 12, 1876.
I have the honour to bring under your Lordship’s notice a “ Memorandum ”
which has been handed to me by my Government, in which they express their hope that
Her Majesty’s Government may be induced to establish a dep6t of food and clothing on
the “ Crozet Islands,” for the use of any persons who may unfortunately be wrecked there.
2. The recent loss of the “ Strathmore,” together with the fearful sufferings expe-
rienced by the crew and passengers who succeeded in reaching the shore, has naturally
attracted much attention to these islands, which, from their position in the direct course
of ships trading to New Zealand and Australia, are a constant source of danger to
vessels employed in that trade; and in view of the largely increased and still increasing
trade between England and these Colonies, it would seem desirable, now that attention
has so unfortunately been drawn to the subject, to take some steps which would at any
rate alleviate the sufferings of any persons who may in future unfortunately be wrecked
upon them.
3. The cost of establishing such a depot as that proposed could not be large, while it
may be the means of saving many valuable lives. j ave

Memorandum for His Excellency.
The Chamber of Commerce at Christchurch recently drew attention to the privations
and sufferings of the survivors from the wreck of the “ Strathmore ” on the Crozet
Islands, and suggested that the Home authorities should be urged to place thereon a
supply of food and clothing for the relief of castaways.
As these dangerous islets lie in the track of vessels making the voyage from Europe to
Australia and New Zealand, there can be no question as to the desirability of taking the
precaution to prevent any persons who may hereafter be unfortunately cast ashore there
from encountering sufferings such as those to which the survivors from the “ Strathmore ”
were exposed. The Government, therefore, beg that his Excellency will represent this
matter for the favourable consideration of the Home Government.
It appears from correspondence between the Lords of the Admiralty and the Com-
mittee of Lloyd’s, with respect to Her Majesty’s ships calling at the islands between the
Cape of Good Hope and Australia, for the purpose of rescuing persons who may be
shipwrecked upon any of them (a copy of which correspondence was laid before the
.House of Commons, and printed), that my Lords decided to give orders that Her
Majesty’s ships proceeding from the Cape of Good Hope to Australia shall, in future,
when possible, pass the Crozets sufficiently near to examine them.
The Government venture to express a hope that, on the representations made herein
being conveyed to the Lords of the Admiralty, they will see fit to supplement the instruc-
tions they have already given, by directing that a supply of food and clothing shall be
landed on the islands, as promptly as possible, from one of Her Majesty’s ships; and that
whenever the group is subsequently visited, the depot shall be inspected, and the supply
renewed as far as may be necessary.

Sir, Downing Street, February 21, 1877.
With reference to the letter from this Department of the 15th of May last, and
to the reply from the Admiralty of the 18th of the same month,* in regard to the
importance of Her Majesty’s ships visiting, whenever practicable, the groups of unin-
habited or unfrequented islands lying more or less in the track of vessels trading
between this country and the Australasian Colonies, I am directed by the Earl of Car-
narvon to transmit to you, to be laid before the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty,
a copy of a Despatch from the Governor of New Zealand,f enclosing a memorandum from
his Government expressing their hope that the Lords Commissioners will supplement
the instructions they have already given upon this subject, by directing that a dep6t of
food and clothing be’ established on the Crozet Islands for the use of any persons who
may unfortunately be wrecked there.
Lord Carnarvon desires me to add an expression of his own strong hope that it will
be in the power of their Lordships to comply with the suggestion made by the New
Zealand Government.

■Sir, Admiralty, March 10, 1877.
With reference to your letter of the 21st February last,J and its enclosures relative
to the establishment of a depot of food and clothing in the Crozet Islands for the use of
any persons ■who may be shipwrecked there, I am commanded by my Lords Commis-
sioners of the Admiralty to acquaint you, for the information of the Earl of Carnarvon,
that great difficulties exist in the way of placing dep6ts on these islands, as they are all
“ iron-bound,’’ and, as a rule, inaccessible. Landing anywhere, even under favourable

auspices, is precarious. The weather, as a rule, is extremely boisterous, accompanied
with fogs, and there is only one known anchorage in the whole group, and this is a small
and open one on the leewardmost island,
2. The group consists of five islands or clusters of islets, the largest of which is about
13 miles in length and seven in breadth, and they occupy an area included in 35 miles
of latitude and two degrees of longitude.
3. My Lords desire me here to observe that the “Strathmore” was lost on the
northernmost of the group, which appears to be the smallest cluster, so that depbts on
any other of the islands would in the case of that ship have been wholly useless. To
place depots on each of the islands would, therefore, appear to be the only solution of
the proposal recommended, and to do this would involve much risk and a great outlay
of time.
4. Their Lordships further consider that it would be “very undesirable to carryout
the suggestions made in the communications before referred to, as ships can have no
possible excuse for nearing the Crozets when making a passage to Australia or New
Zealand; and if depots were provided there it would be tantamount to offering a premium
for them to navigate in the neighbourhood. There is abundance of ocean room to the
northward of these islands, and, in their Lordships’ opinion, it is a dereliction of duty in
any captain going near them, considering the fogs and tempestuous weather that prevail
in their neighbourhood; and, further, that in the lower latitude of 40° S., or thereabouts,
finer and more favourable winds arb found.
5. In conclusion, my Lords would remark that in all the discussion which has been
brought about by the lamentable affair of the “ Strathmore,” the fact that this ship was
more than 80 miles out of her reckoning at the time of the wreck appears to have been
entirely lost sight of.

The EARL OF CARNARVON to the MARQUIS OF NORMANBY.
My Lord, Downing Street, March 17, 1877.
I have received your Despatch of the 12th of December,* enclosing a memo-
randum from your Ministers expressing their hope that the Lords Commissioners of
the Admiralty will, in addition to the orders they have already given, that any of Her
Majesty’s ships proceeding from the Cape of Good Hope to Australia shall, when possible,
sight the Crozet Islands sufficiently near to examine them, issue further instructions that
a dep6t bf food and clothing shall be established on the islands for the use of any persons
who may unfortunately be wrecked there.
2. I have been in communication with the Lords Commissioners of the .Admiralty
upon the subject, and I enclose a copy of the reply I have received from their Lord-
ships, f
3. From this letter your Ministers will learn that great difficulties exist in complying
with their suggestion, owing to the inaccessible nature of the Crozet Islands; and, more-
over, that depbts would have to be established on each of the islands, owing to the
scattered nature of the group, in order to ensure that persons shipwrecked there would be
able to avail themselves of them.
4. But, in addition to these difficulties, their Lordships again point out, as they did in
their letter to the Secretary of Lloyd’s, dated the 10th of May 1876,J to which your
Ministers refer, that the Crozet Islands do not lie in the proper track of vessels trading
to Australia and New Zealand, and that grfeat and unjustifiable risks are incurred by
those captains who persist in making their course in such high latitudes,
5. The opinions which their Lordships • express appear to me to be conclusive, and as
it is desirable that their views should be known as widely as possible I propose to lay the
correspondence which has passed on the subject before Parliament.

Report respecting the Crozet Islands, South Indian Ocean.
H.M.S. Wolverene, at Sea, Lat. 37° 9'South, Long. 150° 57' E.
Sir, 4th January 1877.
I have the honour to submit to you for the information of the Lords Commissioners
of the Admiralty the following report of an examination of the Crozet Islands, made in
accordance with the directions of their Lordships, to ascertain if there was any appearance of
castaways or vessels which may have wrecked there.
2. We left Simons Bay on 18th November, and proceeded to the south until we fell in with
the prevailing westerly winds in latitude 38° south, longitude 18° east. We then steered
straight for the Crozet Islands until we reached latitude 43° 26' south, longitude 36° 10' east,
the islands then being 622 miles distant. We now entered a dense fog which continued with
rare intervals of open sky until the morning of the 30th, at which time we had nearly run
our estimated distance.
3. We were on the point of heaving to, to wait for the weather to clear, when a sudden
lift of mist disclosed for a few minutes the west end of the Twelve Apostles about three miles
off on the bow.
4. This point of the island is remarkable for its lofty group of pinnacle rocks closely
resembling the Needles. These, although attached by their base to the island, appeared
when first seen like sharp jagged peaks arising separately from the sea, and it was the low
morning light penetrating between the open spaces that cause them to stand out so clearly,
the island itself was not visible. A high rolling sea broke heavily on the weather shore.
5. At about 9 of the forenoon the fog again lifted, and I steamed in for the land to
examine the Twelve Apostles (the island on which the Strathmore was wrecked), firing guns
to attract attention.
6. It was evident that no close observation could be made unless a change took place in
the weather, hut most fortunately the fog cleared away and was succeeded by two singularly
fine and calm days, and we were thus able to examine the shores, bays, and hill slopes within
a distance from which any people or signs of wreck could have been distinctly seen.
7. A small cairn, raised by the survivors from the “ Strathmore,” still exists at a point on
the ridge about 300 feet above the sea. A grassy plateau where they were encamped was
covered with white albatrosses sitting on their nests, and the rocks were crowded with
penguins. Seabirds of various kinds were numerous, attracted by a good stream of fresh
water which flows from the hill over the cliff into the sea.
8. After completing the examination of the Twelve Apostles, I steamed across to Hog
Island and examined its leeward coast. Here, as at the Twelve Apostles, the valleys and hill
sides were dotted with white albatrosses.
The top of this island was covered with snow, and, although it was now the summer of
these latitudes, large quantities of snow were still lying in the cleft of the rocks near the
shore. The windward or west side of Hog Island is precipitous and much exposed, and I
did not see any places where wrecked people could settle, but upon its lee or eastern slope
there were several fairly sheltered positions, where the landing would not be difficult. The
lower sides of the hills are covered with coarse grass. There are numerous birds and rabbits
and several fresh water streams.
9. 1 now proceeded to Penguin Island, the southern extremity of the Crozet Group. This
is a bare precipitous rock about miles in circumference. I could not see any water here,
and very few birds.
This volcanic island appears to be destitute of any means of preserving life, and unfortu-
nately it is, from its position, the most dangerous for vessels proceeding by a great circle
route to Australia.
10. The search round the shores of the Windward Islands occupied one day, and the next
was employed in a similar manner examining the Eastern Islands.


11. The first visited was Possession Island, the largest and most important of the group.
When off Nairne Bay we observed on the beach a hut, several casks, and two boats, one of
which seemed to be in fair condition. The sea being smooth and the wind light, I decided
to anchor and send in our boats to search the shore, as I thought it probable we should find
some record left by people who might have gone there in the hope of meeting a sealing
vessel.
12. Upon landing, our interest was immediately excited by the strange, sensation of finding
ourselves surrounded by animals which evidently had not the slightest fear of men or their
guns. Hundreds of seals which were resting on the damp grass bordering on the stream, which
at this point enters the sea, made no attempt to escape from us; the albatrosses also would
not move from their nests on the ground. These magnificent birds, measuring in several
instances 11 feet across the wings, only showed resistance when actually seized, and even
then did not seem to have any sense of danger. The bay was alive with birds; we observed
the white and sooty albatross, peterels of various kinds, black hens and cape pigeons,
numerous gulls, and a few wild ducks, and the rocks were covered with seals and penguins.
13. The hut was about 12 feet long, and contained six sleeping bunks; it was rudely
constructed with staves of casks. There was a stove inside on the right of the door
ingeniously made out of an old fish kettle; the funnel was formed by a series of small iron
hoops nailed together. There were a number of empty casks outside together with other
debris belonging to a sealing establishment. There were two whale boats hauled up on the
beach ; one of these was useless, the other with some slight repairs could be made seaworthy.
The name J. A. Brink was cut on the door of the hut. We found no fdocument, or any
signs of the bay having been lately visited. The following record was placed in a tin box
and secured to the - stove in the hut: Her Brittannic Majesty’s ship “ Wolverene,” 17 guns,
visited each island of the Crozet group to ascertain if there were any shipwrecked people on
them, and finally called at this bay on the Ist December 1876 on her way to Perth, Western
Australia, from England.
14. We concluded our examination by steaming round and searching the steep and
desolate shores of East Island, the last of the group.
15. Soon after leaving the land and while the Crozets were still visible, we passed close to
a large iceberg whose height was estimated at 300 feet, and the circumference at the water
line about three miles.
16. Judging from my experience, I would submit that merchants vessels should be cautioned
against going down to a higher latitude than the 44th parallel; in the stormy latitudes south
of this the westerly gales propel a ship through the water at a great speed, and the seas are
so high that it would be difficult to check the speed or haul to the wind to clear danger.
The Crozets are in a known position and can be avoided by careful navigation, but this is not
the case with icebergs ; if one of these should happen to be floating in the line of course of a
vessel going through the water at a rate of 12 or 13 knots during a fog by day or on a dark
night it would not be seen until it was too near to be avoided and destruction would be certain.
Icebergs in these southern seas should be considered as representing rocks or shoals in
unknown positions. Merchant ships r;ushing blindly through. these dangers run most
criminal risks, they play a daring game of chance at which the lives of the passengers and
crews are hazarded. It is more than probable that the majority of the ships reported as
missing in these seas are missing because wrecked by sudden and violent contact with
drifting icebergs.
17. In the event of people being cast away on the Crozets I would recommend that, if
possible, they should establish a look out place on the Twelve Apostles; this island is the
one which would most probably be sighted by ships, and an object placed or a man standing
on the ridge where the “ Strathmore ” cairn is erected would be seen at a great distance.
The north-east point of the Twelve Apostles is by the chart placed in longitude 50° 41'
east. Our chronometers placed the point in longitude 50° 36' east. This is assuming the
latitude to be correct, as no observations for latitude could be obtained. If our longitude is
correct the Twelve Apostles should therefore be placed five miles west of their present
position on the chart.
18. Attached to this letter is a copy of the log for the two days that the “Wolverene” was
examining the Crozet group.
I have, &c.
