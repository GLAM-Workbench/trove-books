LIFE AT SEA
AND
AUSTRALIAN & NEW ZEALAND
PASSENGEES' GUIDE.
Experience teaches us that emigration with its
beneficial influences is a movement that with each
hour of its existence becomes more and more popular.
Yearly, monthly, weekly, daily, does it verify the
now famous truism of the late Lord Beaconsfield
that there is ?no success, like success.? In this
case essentially the success lies in its own intrinsic
merits?in its results, which have proved themselves
emphatically beneficial and fruitful of good effects
on all classes of society.
Notwithstanding that men of judgment, and in-
fluence, and power, have set their faces resolutely
against the ?bone and muscle,? as they term it,
being carried into distant lands, the great tidal wave
of humanity still surges onwards with redoubled
force to those havens of promise?those colonies of
ours at the Antipodes, viz., Australia and New
Zealand, and the nearer dependencies of North
America, where all may enjoy similar blessings as
in England, in the shape of just laws and govern-
ment, and with the happy knowledge that they
are all subjects of one Queen ?Victoria.
Our little kingdom, little only in space, is in pro-
portion to its size the most densely populated country
in the world. Statistics prove that its population
increases in a ratio to double itself in half a century.
Now at this increasing rate what would become of
Great Britain and its people if there were not some
vent?some relief to this over pressure ? What better
safety valve could there be than emigration? It
gives not only relief to those who go away, but to
those who remain behind. ?In emigration lies the
best and most effectual remedy against poverty. It
is the most wholesome and natural means of relief.?
To all common sense minds it must be infinitely
better that our poor, no matter of what class, should
go to distant lands where they must labour, and can
labour with good profit, than sink perhaps into ever-
lasting pauperism at home.
We all know the depressing influences of oyer
population, and the grinding competition which
makes it so difficult to live. Our prisons, our peni-
tentiaries, our crowded workhouses, the constant
cries for work, the innumerable deaths by starvation
?each tell their own sad piteous story.
We have only to walk down our narrow streets,
and dense courts, and crowded alleys, to see very
often a family of all ages packed in one room, where
the air is heavy with the seeds of impurity and
disease, where vice and drunkenness run riot, and
crime and death stalk hand in hand. ?If the
towns and cities of Britain are overcrowded ; if
thousands who would willingly work cannot find
the work to do ; and if in consequence poverty and
want stare us in the face, as they so often do at
every corner, what does this mean? Why, what
but that the raw materials of our manufactures,
and the markets to carry these manufactures to,
are alike defective and limited as compared with
our productive ability. If millions on millions there
are of acres of land capable of supplying to the
fullest extent the raw materials in question, and
of forming the happy and comfortable abodes of
communities who would afford to our producers
the best of markets for their goods, what does that
signify, clearly and indisputably to all who will
take the trouble to think of it, but that the balance
of labour and capital is in favour of these promising,
though for the.time being, unproductive regions.?
To the struggling millions at home, who can
intelligently doubt, that the departure of some little
?bone and muscle,? aye, and capital too, could
result in aught but the highest good ? The wealth
thus abstracted from the country in the form of
labour and capital, like the seed taken from the
garners of the husbandman, and scattered over the
fruitful bosom of the land, would assuredly return
to us increased to ten, fifty, or even an hundred
fold. To the capitalist, as well as to the labourer,
would this in the end be true ; for, if wages were
higher, so would also be prices, and if the home
market were even to some extent more limited,
as I cannot believe it would?all having from the
greater prevalence of plenty the greater ability to


purchase?the foreign and colonial markets might
with reason be expected to be indefinitely increased.?
It is useless for any one to emigrate who cannot
carry with him health, strength, industry, and a
strong determined will to overcome all difficulties,
to endure disappointment, and patience to wait
results. In those lands of the Antipodes a man
cannot indulge in the genteel profession of living on
his wits. He must put his shoulder to the wheel.
He must be prepared to dig and delve and build,
to plough and sow and reap. He has, however,
this satisfaction for his energy and patient industry,
that he labours for a tangible something, for a truly
remunerative living, not a bare subsistence?a living
that means, with continued determined labour and
economy, an honourable independence, a home and
lands and property, a comfortable old age, and the
satisfaction that he leaves his family well provided.
To the careless, ?ne?er do weel,? whose faults
are more ? want of head than want of heart,?
emigration is often the salutory means of making
him a respectable individual. Of course he must
have the ? true grit ? in him, or he would remain a
scamp anywhere to the end of his days. ?A great
many people are reckless and improvident simply
because they have nothing or but little to lose.
With any small possession they may come to call
their own comes the wish for more, and this acts
as an incitement to increased industry, economy,
and forethought. There is no better instrument
for the amelioration of the condition of society in
countries like our own so immediately, and so ex-
tremely available, so easily worked, or so certain
and speedy in its results as emigration.? Its
demands are simple. It does not require high moral
or intellectual attainments, or patronage, or favour.
It simply demands men, women, and children of the
ordinary stamp of character, possessed of British
strength, British pluck, British determination, and
British common sense to work out a prosperous
future. ?Those who would not succeed in the
colonies are those who would not succeed anywhere,
or under any conditions: whilst it is not too much,
on the other hand, to affirm, that hundreds of
thousands would prosper and become useful and
intelligent members of society, producers of raw
materials of manufactures, and customers for those
manufactures in the colonies, who, overpowered at
home by the crushing difficulties of their position,
and the overmastering poverty and hardships against
which they are called to wage an unavailing war,
become permanent burdens to the mother country,
and obstacles alike to economic and moral progress.?
What do our struggling thousands gain by emi-
gration to such lands as Australia and New Zealand,
and what do they lose? For the foggy uncertain
climate of Great Britain they will find one equally
healthful and invigorating. Instead of crowded and
packed rooms, comfortable homes, and broad smiling
acres?a soil on which Dame Nature has lavished
her richest gifts, and ?which will yield a compen-
sating reward for labour bestowed? ?they will
exchange a miserable subsistence for a comfortable
living; they will acquire health, strength, and
happiness. For the civilization they leave behind
they will be welcomed by all its blessings?political,
educational, and religious on the shores of their
new home. ?? In fact they will find all the elements
of nature and the advantages of civilization to make
life prosperous and happy.?
The object of this little work is to give the
intending emigrant every practical information as
to his outfit, rates of passage, ship-kit, life at sea,
his prospects in Australia and New Zealand, with
descriptive details of the resources, attractions, and
advantages, the soil, climate, products, farming, and
other pursuits, trades, and wages of those countries.
OUTFIT.
When an emigrant has decided upon what he is
going to take, let him pack as follows: ?In a box
net more than twelve inches high hy thirty inches
long, with good strong lock, let all the linen, &c.,
for the voyage he packed. That is his cabin box.
On all his other boxes his name and destination
must be painted in good bold letters, and ? not
wanted during the voyage,? be written plainly on
them.
Take no unnecessary luggage, have everything
arranged before coming to London, so that the
luggage can be taken straight to the dock where
the vessel lies.
Much extra clothing is not required during the
voyage ?most of the voyage lies in warm latitudes.
Sailing ships as a rule experience a week or two
of cold weather, and perhaps meet with icebergs,
then a little extra clothing is required. It is not
of long duration, and a rug off the bed, or a sharp
walk on deck would do more than heavy clothing.
With regard to outfit, it would be advisable for
the inexperienced to go to a leading house, such
as Hetheringtons, 334, Strand, or to Shepherd?s,
55, Bishopsgate-st., Within, London, and secure
the benefit of their wide and varied experience.
? Really useful clothing and tools are almost equal
to gold in value to the emigrant, but expensive
guns, revolvers, and such like are best left behind.?
RATES �F PASSAGE.
Those who decide to go by steamer must make
application very early for berths, as they are very
rapidly taken up. The publisher will be happy at
any time to book passengers in any steamer or
sailing ship, without charge for booking. Through
means of the Telephone established at 334, Strand,
any information can be instantly obtained by com-
munication with the various shipowners and docks
in London, should any special intelligence be re-
quired. Intending passengers may, if they feel
inclined, speak through the Telephone at this office
to almost any shipowner in London, free of expense,
a proceeding which saves considerable trouble and
time. Passengers can book for New Zealand Ports
by exchanging steamers at Melbourne. The rates
of passages vary, but the following may be con-
sidered as reasonable as can be expected by
steamship.

Return Tickets for Australia.
Passengers booking for the Voyage Out and Homo,
and paying for the round journey before starting,
obtain a reduction of 15 per cent, off the Homeward
Passage Money. Passengers not holding Return
Tickets, who may nevertheless return by tho Line
within twelve months after landing, will, if they
book for their return voyage within one month after
landing, obtain a reduction of 10 per cent, off their
fare for the return passage, according to the Com-
pany?s then existing tariff, and if more than one
month after landing a return of 5 per cent. These
abatements must be applied for at time of re-
booking.
Passengers booked through for ports other than
Melbourne or Sydney proceed from one of these
ports as may be arranged, and may remain on board
the Steamer without extra charge until the departure
of the first branch steamer; but tho Companies will
not be answerable for any hotel expenses or railway
fares, &c., if incurred. Passengers proceeding by
tho first Intercolonial Steamer for their destination
can have their luggage transferred free of charge, at
owner?s risk, but no warehousing will be paid.
A deposit of half the passage money must be paid
at the time of securing a berth, and the balance
at least three days before embarkation. The deposit
will be forfeited in the event of the Passenger not
joining the ship.
The full name, age, occupation, and destination
of the Passenger should be forwarded when applica-
tion is made for a ticket.

Rice, Raisins, Peas, Suet, Vinegar, Pickles, Pre-
served Meat, Soup and Bouilli, or Biscuit.
It will be at the discretion of the Captain to issue,
three times a week, to Children under seven years of
age, four ounces of Rice, or three ounces of Sago, in
lieu of Salt Meat or Preserved Provisions ; also
lb. Soft Baked Bread, in lieu of 1 lb. of Flour,
or 1 lb. Biscuits, or l� lb. Oatmeal, or 1 lb. Rice,
or 1 lb. Peas.
The Sale of Liquors on Board is subject to the
provisions of the Passenger Act, and to the dis-
cretion of the Captain.
The foregoing are the arrangements of the prin-
cipal lines of steamers taking passengers to Australia.
There are occasionally Steamships going from the
Thames and Clyde, taking passengers at a somewhat
cheaper rate: First Cabin, from 45 Guineas ; Second,
26 Guineas; but they have no regular periods of
departure.
The Anglo-Australasian ILine.
It will be remembered that early in the year 1883,
the Anglo-Austualasian Steam Navigation Com-
pany, Limited, was inaugurated. It was brought
forward under favourable auspices. William Mil-
burn & Company, of London and Newcastle-on-
Tyne, have had long and varied experience in the
oversea traffic, and marked success in the Colonial
trade. One of their steamers, the St. Osyth , made
perhaps the quickest passage recorded between this
country and Melbourne by a cargo steamer. It is,
therefore, not surprising that a Company intended
for that particular trade, established under such
direction, should be viewed with confidence. The
line of steamers has been in regular operation for
sometime. The traffic, however, has hitherto been
carried on in chartered tonnage. But now every
arrangement is made for the comfort of passengers,
and a splendid fleet specially built for the purpose is
now ready, and offers unrivalled accommodation for
first and third class passengers. The third class
passengers are berthed on deck, which, in other
steamers, is usually occupied by first and second
class. Tho Port Jackson was the first steamer an-
nounced as ready to take passengers ; but so pleased
were the public after inspection of her accommo-
dation, that a general rush was made to secure
berths in her. Indeed, such was the demand for
passages, that her sister ship, the Tiverton , was
placed on the berth before her, and within a few
days after the date of her sailing was announced,
every available space was taken up.
The Port Jackson is a handsome, well-finished
steamer of some 4,700 tons measurement?fuel space
included; her gross tonnage being 2,700 tons. She
is 317 ft. long, by a little over 37 ft. beam, with
a depth of 27| ft. She is. of practical construction,
built on the spar-deck principle, and to the highest
class at Lloyd?s. The Port Jackson , as well as the
other vessels of the fleet, will be entered on the
Admiralty list for transport service. Each steamer
is divided into seven water-tight compartments,
whereby great immunity from danger by fire, col-
lision, or otherwise, is afforded. The main deck
is of iron, and the upper deck from the fore part
of the fore-hatch to the after part of the after-hatch
is likewise of iron, and sheathed with wood. There
are five hatchways ; the two largest being worked
by winches capable of loading and discharging cargo
simultaneously on each side of the vessel, whilst
the other hatches are worked by single winches
of smaller size. Accommodation for the officers and
engineers is contained in the bridge, while the
second bridge forward gives additional facilities for
a careful look-out. A handsome deck-house affords
accommodation for a limited number of passengers.
But it is not intended to carry many first-class
passengers by this line; great pains having been
exercised to lay the vessels out for the economical
carriage of freight. The saloon of tho Port Jackson ,
however, is handsomely panelled with fancy marble
relieved by ornate pilasters. The spacious berth
accommodation provides every modern com ort. All
the vessels have magnificent ?tween decks, with side
lights, for third- class passengers, for w'hich they are
eminently adapted. The vessels are being rigged
as brigs with a large spread of canvas, whereby
they can in case of accident to machinery be kept
in thorough command.
The engines of the Port Jack mi are calculated
to drive the vessel 11 knots an hour in a laden
condition. They are of extra strength, constructed
by Messrs. Thomas Clark & Co., Elswick ; the
cylinders respectively being 38-in. and 72-in., with
a stroke of 48-in. The steel boilers are made for
a working pressure of 100 lbs. to the square inch.
The estimated consumption of fuel is below 25 tons
of Welsh coal per day, and the vessel is expected


to make the run from London to Adelaide [via the
Suez Canal) in 40 days, including stoppages.
All the vessels have straight stems except
the Port Adelaide , which will have a cut-
water stem and a rakish appearance throughout,
with more powerful engines than the other vessels
of the line. These engines are constructed byMessrs.
Wigham, Richardson, & Co., Newcastle-on-Tyne,
the shafting being of Beardmore built steel.
All the vessels will be supplied with an extra
large amount of spare gear, and their sailing power
will specially fit them for making the passage by
the Cape of Good Hope, or home by Cape Horn,
in case it should be found desirable at any time
to adopt these routes.
The Port Jackson is commanded by Captain James
Hogg, who, for over twenty years, has navigated
vessels owned by the energetic managers of the
Line, whose steamers, St. Osyth, Whampoa, and
Hankow, were, as it will be remembered, the pio-
neers of the direct full-powered steam service with
Australia.
The Anglo-Australasian Steam Navigation Com-
pany, Limited, has laid vigorous hold on the Colonial
trade, and we have no doubt, with the excellent
and efficient steamers it is placing before the public,
it will rapidly advance in popular esteem. Before
many pionths have rolled by, we shall probably
see these steamers going regularly every week.
The Fares by Sailing Ships
Are somewhat cheaper. Thirteen Guineas may,
however, be considered the very lowest that it is
possible for a single man to obtain a passage out
to Australia. The following are the usual terms
offered:?
Chief Cahin Melbourne, from 45 Guineas;
Sydney, 45 Guineas; Adelaide, 45 Guineas ; Bris-
bane, 50 Guineas.
Second Cabin ?Melbourne, from 20 Guineas;
Sydney; 22 Guineas; Adelaide, 22 Guineas; Bris-
bane, 22 Guineas.
Third Cabin (Enclosed for Married Couples and
Single Women) ?Melbourne, from 15 Guineas ;
Sydney, 16 Guineas; Adelaide, 16 Guineas; Bris-
bane, 18 Guineas.
Third Cabin (Open Berths, for Single Men only)
?Melbourne, from 13 Guineas ; Sydney, 14 Guineas;
Adelaide, 14 Guineas ; Brisbane, 16 Guineas.
Children under 12 years of age, half-price; In-
fants under 12 months, free.
Passengers booking at through rates or any of
the above-mentioned ports to proceed by Inter-
colonial steamer are kept on board the ship in
Melbourne till the steamer?s departure for their
destination.
The extra rates to Tasmania and New Zealand,
in addition to the Melbourne fares, are the same
as offered by the Steamship Companies, previously
quoted under Steamship fares.
Fares to Kew Zealand, by Steam.
Some splendid vessels, constructed of steel, have
just been built for the New Zealand trade. They
offer unsurpassed accommodation for passengers of
all classes, and the passage may confidently be
expected to be made under 50 days from London.
The Saloons and State Rooms are on deck amid-
ships ; they are fitted with every requisite, includ-
ing arrangements for heating, also Smoking Rooms
and Ladies? Cabins. A liberal table with fresh
meat, &c., will be supplied. Wines, Spirits, Beer,
and Mineral Waters can be procured on Board at
moderate prices.
The Second Class Passengers will have roomy
Cabins supplied with Bedding, &c., and a good
table will be kept.
Third Class Passengers must provide themselves
with Bedding, Mess Utensils, &c., but their meals
will be cooked by the Ship?s servants.
Fares to Wellington & Canterbury.
First Class (Saloon Cabins), 50 to 70 Guineas;
Second Class, 35 to 40 Guineas; Third Class (Closed
Cabins, with 2 Berths), for Married Couples, 20
Guineas each; ditto, with 4 Berths, 18 Guineas
each; Steerage (Open Berths for Men only), 15
Guineas. Children under 12 years of age, travelling
with their parents, half-price. Infants under 12
months, free.
Passengers booked through to other ports in New
Zealand on payment of the following extra fares :
Port Chalmers, �2 Saloon, or �1 Fore Cabin ; Nelson
and Napier, �2 or �1; New Plymouth and Auck-
land, �4 or �2; they will have the privilege of
remaining on Board these Steamers free of charge,
until the first Intercolonial Steamer starts for their
destination. The Brokers will not be held liable
for any Hotel expenses or Railway fares, &c., if
incurred.
Victualling.
The usual scale of Victualling for Third Cabin
passengers by these steamers, per week, for each
adult Third Cabin passenger, is as follows: ?Pre-
served Meats, 1 lb.; Indian Beef, 1� lb.; Mess Pork
li lb.; Rice or Barley, 1 lb.; Flour, 3 lb.; Biscuit,
3J lb. ; Split Peas, J pint: Oatmeal, 1 lb. ; Raw
Sugar, 1 lb.; Tea, 2 oz.; Coffee, 2 oz.; Butter, 6 oz.;
Raisins or Currants, J lb.; Lime Juice (in Tropics)
6 oz.; Suet, 6 oz.; Pickles, y pint; Vinegar, y pint,
Treacle, J lb.; Mustard, J oz.; Pepper, J oz.; Salt,
2 oz.; Fresh Potatoes, 2 lb., or Preserved ditto, Jib.;
Water, 21 quarts.
For all Children between 1 and 4, and Infants,
an equivalent quantity of Sago, Flour, Rice, Raisins,
Suet, and Sugar will be substituted for Salt Meat,
if required. Provisions of the best quality are put
on board according to the above Scale, together with
an abundant supply of extra Stores and Medical
Comforts for passengers generally. Passengers are
found according to the above Dietary Scale, and
not by that in the Contract Ticket.
We have now the advantage of direct Lines, both
Steam and Sailing Ships to New Zealand, but
passengers can always book through to New Zealand
by any Ship going to Melbourne or Sydney, where
arrangements are made to transfer passengers and
luggage, without cost to themselves, to a Colonial
Steamer.
Useful Hints.
Po not take too many luxuries to vary the ship?s
dietary. It is waste of money, and upsets the
stomach.
Po not indulge in spirituous drinks ; if taken,
take only as you would a medicine.
Po not take money with you, except just a little
for current use ; go to the Bank and get a draft on
one of the Colonial Banks. You have only to
present your draft on arrival, and the money is
at once handed to you. This can be arranged by
the publisher.
Po take a bright, cheerful, contented, hopeful
disposition with you.

LIFE AT SKA.
The following account of ?Life at Sea? is the
diary of one of the passengers on board the Sea
Gull {*) ?bound from London to Australia. It may
be taken as a very fair narrative of the occurrences
and customs incidental to the usual life on board a
sailing ship, and the various pastimes and amuse-
ments got up first by one party, and then another,
to enliven the dull monotony of a three months?
voyage. The life on board a steamship is somewhat
similar, only the voyage is necessarily shorter. The
publisher of this little work has made passages to
and from the Antipodes both by sailing and steam-
ships, and to those intending passagers who can spare
time, he does not hesitate to say that oftentimes a
long journey in a sailing ship is more beneficial
to health than a passage by fast steamer.
should remember that carriage is dear at all times.
Three pounds were paid in December for half a
horseload for thirty miles, to the gold diggings,
over a mountain track.
?A workman may take his tools; but cradles
and carts, and all the heavy paraphernalia recom-
mended in ironmongers? lists, are better bought in
the colony, to which first-rate merchants are largely
shipping from the advices of their own corres-
pondents. Half such outfits will be found useless,
and half the remainder unserviceable. Clothes are
nearly as cheap in the colonies as in England, They
should be selected with a view to very cold as well
well as warm weather. The mining districts are
subject to sleet and torrents of rain. A large loose
coat of the best pilot cloth, made after the fashion of
a soldier?s great coat down to the heels, with a large
waterproof cape, loose sleeves, and capacious pockets
inside, is a capital travelling companion.
? On board ship any old trousers, if warm or light
enough, according to the weather, will do. Shoes
without heels on board. In the colonies good strong
Wellington boots, of the best materials, and not too
tight or heavy. In the bush, and at the diggings,
woollen jerseys, blue or red, are the wear, and
blue striped shirts, were woollen is not worn. In
the chief towns of Australia gentlemen dress exactly
as they do in England, allowing for the difference of
climate ; and, except boots, the prices are about the
same. Both woollen and cotton stockings are needed.
Hats can be bought in the colony cheap enough;
two caps, one to be blown away, will be sufficient
for the voyage.
Preparations for Voyage.
? The first general rule is to take as much money,
and as little of a useless or cumbrous nature, as
possible. This rule especially applies to purchases.
Those who are leaving a well-furnished house or
shop will do well to review their possessions, and
select a number of useful articles which are not
large, nor heavy, and not worth much to sell. In
travelling to a strange place, porterage, wharfage,
and warehouse room are very expensive.
? * The common practice of an intending emigrant
is to discard all he has, and set out with a bran-
new stock of everything. The reverse is the better
plan ?? Begin by mustering what you have got, and
see how much will do.? A single man should be
in light marching order, and should endeavour to
take no more clothes than he could, at a pinch,
make up in a bundle and carry, groaning, on his
back for a mile.
THE DIARY OF CHARLES
GOODWILL.
?A family should take no cumbrous furniture,
no pianos, no mangles, unless proceeding to settle
near friends in a seaport of the colonies, where
labour has become too dear to pay for making chairs
and tables. A chair that folds up flat may be useful
for ? mamma; ? knives and forks, pewter plates, and
teapots will be useful on the voyage, and in town
or bush; so will plated articles, and many little
household things that weigh little, take up no great
room, and sell for nothing at an auction.
? Beware of ingenious costly cabin fittings ; con-
sult some experienced sea-going friend; half the
articles that look tempting in a show-room are
useless at sea. But persons going to the interior
Tuesday , December 29th. ?I have just been a week
at sea, and I will tell you how I came here. I
found, like many others, that I was not doing well
in my native land. My father, when he died, left
me a very nice little business, and a snug little sum
besides. For a time I did very well, but whether
from entrusting my affairs too much to the honesty
or rather dishonesty of others, together with the
grinding competition of the times, I gradually be-
came conscious of the fact that my customers were
getting beautifully less, my business embarrassed,
and I felt convinced that bankruptcy loomed dimly
in the distance. I was cogitating my unenviable
situation over my panacea of all ills, my evening

i,? several incidents of a personal character, has
considered it advisable to adopt this fictitious name


pipe, when a letter was handed to me. It was from
my old friend and chum Billy Biggs, who six years
ago had emigrated to Australia with scarcely any-
thing to call his own, and was now a prosperous
settler there. His letter ended in the following
characteristic style of his: ?If you are down in the
mire, why not come out to me, old chappie. You
will find a hearty welcome. Sell that musty old
business of yours, gather all the coin you can to-
gether, for the more ?American salve? you take
anywhere the better and come out to me by the next
ship. Leave your dandy-jim habits and finicking
ways behind. Here you must emphatically be a man.
You must work not only with your brains but with
your hands, and if you do this perseveringly I?ll eat
my head if in five years you don?t become as pros-
perous as I am. Come out here, my boy, and live,
for you won?t know what life is till you do. I shall
look out for you by the next ship.?
This letter and my ill luck decided me. Two
months later, I took a steerage passage on the splendid
clipper, the Sea Gull, and here I am a week already
on my way to my old friend Billy Biggs and I
trust a happy and prosperous future.
To-day is the 29th, and we weighed anchor on
the 15th. How this week has gone I hardly know.
I tried to bear up bravely against the terrible feeling
of sea-sickness. I resisted it till it completely over-
came me, sending me utterly prostrate. I was in
that condition that you might have tied me to the
mainmast, or consigned me to the watery depths
below?it would have been a matter of perfect in-
difference to me. It was more than annoying to me
to find so many of my fellow passengers ?in the
vr y best of spirits, larking about as if they were on
terra firma. I coujd not understand why Neptune
should have picked me out to undergo the tortures
for at least a dozen others ?but experience has taught
me that, on an average, out of every nine passengers
only one is thoroughly bad, and if he don?t receive
sympathy from the remaining eight, why they are
inhuman. I preferred to have my little sickness to
myself, and for the first day or so secreted myself in
my bunk. I soon however recovered and ? Richard
is himself again.? The fresh sea breeze is so bracing
and invigorating that I feel like a new man already,
and am now quite prepared to enjoy my new and
novel life.
?My fellow passengers are beginning to feel the
same. They are recovering also to a great extent
from the melancholy feeling of having parted with
home, and dear friends, and relatives. The adieus
and good-byes on the scene of departure were truly
heart-rending, and I, who had but few ties to sever,
felt a bit queer myself. I felt especially so when
the shores of Old England were fading from my gaze
?when they became gradually and gradually as it
were like a line of dark shadow that melted away
between the sky and the sea. ? Surely not for
ever? I murmured, and for the moment my heart
seemed to leap into my mouth and choke me, and a
mist suffused my eyes.
Our passage through the famous and dreaded Bay
of Biscay, so popular in song, was accomplished with
some difficulty ; the ship was well tossed about by
the fury of the waves. Now we are off the Coast of
Spain, and enjoying calm waters and balmy breezes.
Every one is becoming more and more accustomed to
his ocean life, and to get on his ? sea legs ? without
much trouble.
Our surroundings are everything desirable?clean-
liness and order prevail everywhere?the provisions
are good. The captain is a thorough nice fellow?
genial, cheerful, and ever anxious for the comfort
and welfare of all on board?Howard is his name.
The first mate is also very popular : the second mate
is just the reverse. The sailors are all good speci-
mens of the jolly English Jack Tar?there are a few
foreigners amongst them, and one negro, Sambo,
who is an especial favourite of mine. This sable
gentlemen has been instructing me occasionally the
last two days, in the interesting accomplishment of a
plantation break-down, to the euphonious accom-
paniment of a Jew?s harp. His grave decision is
that I could become a first-rate nigger dancer.
What a pity I did not think of that before leaving
England, as that invariably ?pays.?
Our Fare.
Taken as a whole the steerage fare is substantial
and wholesome, and on most ships there is very
little to complain of either as regards quality or
quantity: but there are always thin-skinned or fas-
tidious persons even amongst steerage passengers,
and these may be heard to grumble sometimes when
there is really no cause for them to do so. If the
emigrant cannot subsist on steerage fare, and has
not and means to travel as a higher grade of passen-
ger, he ought never to emigrate, as he is certainly
not the kind of person required in new countries, who
should be those only who are not easily stuck with
trifles. Intermediate or second-class passengers fare
somewhat better than those in the steerage. They
have good, plain substantial meals, with dinners
from the joint, and are provided by the ship with all
necessary bedding, etc., though they have no sepa-
rate promenade on deck, which is in common with
those of the steerage. Cabin passengers have a more
liberal table. They live much the same, or even
have greater variety, than do guests at first-class
hotels. Their sleeping accomodation is well appoint-
ed, and baths are provided. The saloon where their
meals are served up is tastefully and even luxuriantly
furnished and decorated. A separate promenade is
reserved for the use of cabin passengers only, this
being situated ? aft,? and on the poop deck.
We have a very decent library on board, besides
the various books brought by the passengers them-
selves, and which they freely lend to each other. On
different parts of the vessel all sorts of games and
pastimes are going on, such as chess, cards, drafts,
athletic sports, &c., &c. To-day we formed a com-
mittee of 14 (of which I was nominated chairman)
for the express purpose of organising a series of
entertainments for the enlivenment of the ship?s
company, and a general meeting will be held to-
morrow to enquire into the special talents of those
on board, and to form a musical band. The Society
has been formally christened the ?Universal Enliven -
er,? and fresh members join it every hour.

The General Meeting.
December 30 th. The meeting was a complete
success. It was attended by every one who could
possibly be there, whether crew or company. The
ladies were in great force. It really was a most
laughable entertainment in itself, and a very lengthy
one. A motion was carried by a majority of the
members ? that as each individual volunteered his
?or her services for the occasion, he or she should
? give an impromptu specimen of his or her singing,
? playing, acting, or dancing.? The results were
excruciatingly funny, and the roars of laughter that
resounded on all sides bore ample evidence of an
appreciative audience. After a very lengthy dis-
cussion, the performers and their parts were chosen,
and it was formally announced that the grand
Variety Entertainment, entitled ?HodgePodge,?
would take place that day fortnight when the grand
saloon would be graciously put at the disposal of
the performers and the ship?s company. It was
further announced that a banquet would be after-
wards given to the illustrous artistes at the expense
of the committee as a recognition of their dis-
tinguished and varied services.
Weather inclined to be stormy. Head winds and
sea.
Aii gilt Watches.
This morning early, the captain and the_ doctor
met the male portion of our floating community, and
appointed watches for every night at sea. It need
scarcely be stated that with few exceptions, the wish
of the captain was readily assented to, and com-
mittees wore at once formed for mailing the necessary
arrangements. The duties of the watch is to see
that there is no smoking between decks, prevent the
spread of fire, and, in short, to guard the lives and
property of the passengers.
lecture by Mr. Gardner.
January Zrd? On New Year?s Day we had a very
interesting sanitary lecture delivered to us by our
clever doctor. It was listened to with great atten-
tion, and the latter part, where he spoke of the health
and safety of the ship,appeared favourably to impress
all. He ended in these words: ? ? Storm and tempest,
fire and disease, are the enemies against which we
have to guard at sea. To maintain our supremacy
over the winds and waves we trust in Divine Provi-
dence, and the skill of the captain, and his officers ;
but with respect to fire and disease every man and
woman on board is personally responsible. Every
fire at sea, which is not due to spontaneous combus-
tion of cargo, might, I believe, be traced to the
careless act of one individual. We carry nothing as
far as I am aware liable to such combustion, con-
sequently, if every person on board considers himself,
or herself personally responsible for the safety of the
ship from fire, we shall certainly be free from dan-
ger. To this end smoking below is strictly prohibited
and the danger from sparks would be reduced to a
minimum, if passengers will smoke only on the lee
side of the ship. Great care should be exercised also
in extinguishing lights and matches, no wick or
match should be left smouldering, but extinguished
perfectly and completely. No one who remembers
the fate of the Cospatrick will consider any precau-
tion too minute, or care too great, that tends to
preserve us from the horrors of fire.
With regard to disease, it should be remembered
that fever of the worst possible type, may be caused
by inattention to cleanliness. The floor space allotted
to each passenger or family is not too large to be
kept perfectly clean, and every individual is person-
ally responsible for the cleanliness of his or her berth
and cabin. Every nook and corner should be scraped
and swept out, and the floor kept as dry as possible.
If any disagreeable smell or leakage occur, which is
beyond the control of the occupier of the cabin, com-
plaint should be made at once to one of the ship?s
officers, and if the cause be remediable they may rely
upon its being remedied.
Disinfectants, with instructions for their use, may
be obtained of the medical officer.
Diseases may arise also from circumstances beyond
our control. In such cases attention to cleanliness
and ventilation is doubly necessary, not only to pre-
vent their spread, but to moderate the severity of
existing cases.
At present the health of the ship is satisfactory,
with the exception of three cases of whooping cough.
We are free from epidemic infectious diseases. Sea-
sickness has disappeared, and every one is able to
get on deck.?
New Year?s Eve a ball was held, the first dance
on the voyage, to celebrate the captain?s birthday.
On retiring for the night he gave each man a good
glass of grog, and each female a good strong glass of
port wine. He is very popular with all, not because
of what he gives, but because of his constant endea-
vours to engender good feeling and sociability
amongst all on board.
An Exciting Chase.
January ith. ?To-day three young lads performed
a daring feat. They mounted to the main-topmast
crosstrees, but perceiving that they were followed
by some of the crew, on evil thoughts intent, they
took to the backstays, and coming down with a run,
arrived on deck amid loud applause. Their second
attempt, however, was less successful, as although
two succeeded in evading their pursuers, the third
and smartest was pounced upon from beneath the top
and only released upon his promise of ransom.
Accidents.
The weather is rather rough, and the vessel is
pitching and rolling about in fine style. One young
girl in coming down a ladder fell on her head, which
produced concussion of the brain followed by epilep-
tic fits. With care and attention the doctor gives
every hope of recovery.
It never rains, but it pours.
As one of the single men was standing in the
hatch leading to bis compartment, a cask, insecurely
fixed above, broke away and precipitated him in its
company to the bottom. Beyond a temporary stun,
a severe contusion, and much shaking, he has escaped
from what might have been a serious injury.
Preparations are going on in all parts of the ship
for the grand variety entertainment on the 12th of
January. Practising and rehearsals are going on
from morning till night. Many of the ladies who
will not actively join in it, but merely as spectators,
are using their ingenuity in fashioning and making
up character-dresses for the oecasion out of their old
clothes. It is wonderful what sociability and good
feeling springs up amongst everyone where there is
a will to please and be pleased.
We have sighted several out-bound ships during
he week but spoken to none.
Sports and Pastimes,
January sth. ?'J?he weather is very fine to-day?
light winds and a calm having set in.


In the morning the poop was enlivened by a little
ball practice from six-chamber Deringers, and sundry
other kinds of destructive weapons. The shooting
by the majority was execrable although in a few
instances it was super-excellent. There was one
young fellow who six times running, smashed a glass
bottle swinging in the air. Ho was loudly cheered
each time. He then said he would hit a cork swing-
ing in the air three times running. There were a
good many bets on this, and to the surprise of every-
one, and the disappointment of many who lost their
money, he accomplished this feat as easily as the
first. Ever after that he went by the name of
? William Tell.? William Tell became a great
favourite with all on board. He was an excellent
ventriloquist, and many a pleasant hour has he
helped us to pass away by his clever impersonations.
Many a practical joke did he indulge in, and the
sailors who liked him were half afraid of him, because
not a few times had he got them into terrible scrapes
by the exercise of his really clever powers.
January 10 Ih. ?Nothing of any special consequence
has happened during the last few days. We have
now been nearly three weeks at sea. Wo are enjoy-
ing the climate of the warmer latitudes, but there is a
fresh invigorating breeze that prevents the heat
becoming oppressive. It is a strange and wonderful
sight this wilderness of waters. Wherever one?s
eyes rest there is nothing but sea and sky, and sky
and sea. How sweet and calm and smiling looks
the vast and mighty ocean upon whose bosom we
are gliding! Who would think that it could ever
be so treacherous, cruel, and merciless. May we
only experience its smiles, and never its stormy anger !
Sunday at Sea.
To-day is Sunday.-?Divine service was largely
attended this morning?it was held on the poop.
The Rev. Charles Mason gave a very eloquent dis-
course which impressed us deeply. His text was
??Be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of
another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous;
not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing,
but contrariwise blessing.? We could not help
smiling at the appropriateness of the text which was
fully bore out in the sermon.
The choir, which becomes more and more perfect,
sang this morning most creditably. In the after-
noon Sunday school was held, and it was a pretty
sight to see the rows of happy smiling little faces?
and the little children seemed really to enjoy it.
In the evening a Wesleyan divine is going to hold
forth, but as I have promised poor Sambo, who is
laid up with a sprained leg, to go and read to him,
I shall miss that learned gentleman?s edifying dis-
course.
The Great Variety Entertainment.
January 13 th. ?The great Variety Entertainment
took place early yesterday evening. It was a com-
plete and signal success. The acting and singing
were really admirable. It is the talk of the whole
ship this morning. Every one is anxious to have
a copy of the three groat potters I printed out, as
a souvenir of the Sea Gull, and a reminiscence of one
of the most enjoyable evenings of their lives. That
is at least what they say, and they are writing out
these programmes all over the place. As acting
manager I am glad it is all over, for I feel thor-
oughly fagged out. A good cigar and a bumper of
Bass?s Bitter might refresh me. I?ll go and try it.
They are all bothering the Committee of the
?Universal Enlivener? for another entertainment
a fortnight hence, so I suppose we must smile and
submit.
I subjoin a copy of the programme: ?The Grand
Variety Entertainment entitled : HODGE PODGE,
will take place on board the Sea Gull, on January
12th, when a variety of talent will be exhibited
unsurpassed and unequalled by any in the world, to
commence with the inimitable Farcical Comedy, by
the famous Saville Family, entitled ? He laughs who
Wins ? ; Miss Eva Stoddart, the beautiful and gifted
soprano ; Fred Larkins, the only comic singer of the
day ; Signor Guffauni, the great Buffo vocalist;
the sisters Godwin, character songs and dances;
Messrs. Goodwill and Smiles, in their inimitable
and laughable nigger performance, ?What?s what? ;
the Finigan family, Irish national songs and
dances; George Warbler, the great alto in his
famous impersonation of the Prima Donna ; William
Tell, the world-famed Ventriloquist; Stella Lione,
the eminent contralto: Leo Mountjoy, the gifted
baritone; Lena Medley, the unrivalled female
comedienne, in her famous rendering of ? Women?s
Rights,? to conclude with the diverting Nautical
farce called Blue-eyed Polly, by the sailors of the
Sea Gull, in which they will introduce the grand
national dance?the hornpipe?and popular nautical
songs.?A week to-day a ballad concert is to be
given?the singers, ladies only.
A. Conundrum.
January 15.?We all feel awfully lazy and good
for nothing after our exertions. Our captain, who
is desperately fond of riddles and conundrums, has
offered a prize to any lady or gentleman who can
solve the following. The successful competitor, if
a lady, will have an Indian wrought card case ; if
a gentleman, a box of the finest cigars.
There is in a town, and may be seen daily by
the curious, a most wonderful prophet, whose
generation is truthfully assei?ted. He was before
Adam ; he was with Noah in the ark; he was with
our Saviour before and when crucified; he was
with Columbus when he discovered America; he
was with Captain Cook in his voyage round the
world ; he was with Nelson at the glorious battle of
the Nile; he followed Bounaparte into Russia and
at the battle of Waterloo ; he knew not his father
nor his mother ; his clothes are neither hair, cotton,
silk, nor woollen, neither knit nor spun, they are
not made with hands, they are of a lovely colour,
yet never dyed ; his beard is of a most splendid
shade, and is seldom or ever cut; he goes barefoot
like a grey friar; he cares not for the pomp and
vanity of this world, but would rather live in out-
houses and barns, than dwell in the palace of kings
and princes; he never takes money, the most he
was known to take was a single grain; he has never
yet l&in in a bed or sat in a chair ; he cries out on
the wickedness of the world with out-stretched arms;
the scriptures speak of him as no imposture, for he
constantly proclaims the day of the Lord ; he is
rather inclined to Popery ; he keeps Lent strictly ;
he is well skilled in the ancient and modern lan-
guages ; he leaves all men alone with regard to their
religion ; he believes not in the resurrection of the
dead, yet there is not an article of faith he denies ;
he walks boldly in the face of his enemies, without
either gun or pistol, sword or staff, yet has a weapon
of defence ; he is strictly temperate, drinks nothing
but water, those that follow his example will be
likely to attain a good old age; he looks upon the
English as a barbarous nation, and thinks that he
shall one day be cruelly martyred by them; he
wears neither hat, cap, or wig, and sleeps taking his
rest either standing or crouching; he is composed of


flesh and blood ; always comes when called for, yet
never spoke ; still he preached one sermon that was
so convincing to a great and good man that he did
not rest until he was thoroughly converted. He is
not the wandering Jew, nor John the Baptist, as
some may suppose ; hut pray who is he ?
A Dreadful Alarm.
As I had a great hankering after that box of
cigars, I felt determined to try and solve the above
brain puzzler. I ensconsced myself in a snug corner
of the ship, under an awning, where I could catch
a nice refreshing breeze. I had cracked my brain
over that puzzle for two hours, and was just sinking
into a comfortable doze, when the appalling cry of
? Fire !? rang out on the air. I was on my feet in
a moment. There was a fearful shrieking of
women, and hurrying of feet. A regular stampede
would have taken place if the Captain and Officers
had not at this moment appeared on the scene, and
explained that the fire was already out, thus allay-
ing the fears of all. The captain further addressed
us in the most solemn and impressive manner, ?I
hope the alarm of fire we have had to-day will be a
warning to all not on any account to strike
a match and smoke below. None but those
who have gone through the awful ordeal can have
any idea of that fearful cry ? fire ? at sea. I have
been burnt out at sea 1000 miles from land ; have
watched the ship burn, and finally blown up ; been
obliged to leave her and take to the boats, in which
we remained for nine days, and then, by God?s
blessing, were seen by a ship and taken on board,
helpless through cramp and salt water. While the
ship was burning, all on board obeyed and carried
out quickly my orders; that with God?s help,
enabled us to leave the ship without an accident,
and all were safe from the ship, when like a drunken
man, she reeled and wont down. No words can
express the dreadful hopelessness of leaving a ship
at sea ; so I hope that the accident to-day will do
good as a warning to all.
The Captain?s Riddle.
January 16.?1 have been very much interested
this last day or two watching the flying fish and
the elegant gambols of the dolphins. Nothing very
much at present is going on. No one solved the
riddle, notwithstanding the most desperate efforts to
do so. The answer when made known caused on
little surprise and merriment, the wonderful prophet
turned out to be a rooster !!
Aotes on the Weather.
December 30.?Head winds at sea.
December 31.?Similar winds but more sea.
January 1 to 11. ?Has been a continuation of head
winds, gales, and high seas. Still wo have been
fortunate. Both the sea and the barometer tell us
there has been very bad weather to N.W. By
clearing the Channel as we did we escaped the
heaviest part of it. We have beat to windward 500
miles against wind and sea. On the 11th sighted
the island of Porto Santo.
January 12 and 13.?Calm winds and smooth sea.
January 14.?Head winds and hazy weather.
The Ladies? Concert.
January 20.?Yesterday we, of the male sex, had
a great treat offered us. The ladies? concert went off
admirably. The little orchestra, which was com-
prised of a piano, a voilin, and a flute, consisted only
of lady performers, and their perfection of execution
really astonished all. Some of the voices were of
great sweetness and compass, and the songs on many
occasions were encored. Great credit was due to the
leader of the company, Mrs. Palgrave.
The programme was as follows:?? The banks of
Allan water,? Miss Maclin ; ? Silver threads among
the gold,? Mrs. Snow; ?The harp that rang
through Tara?s hall,? Miss Sullivan; ? John
Anderson, my Jo,? Miss Robertson ; ? I?ll deck my
brow with flowers,? Miss Dawes ; ?For ever and
forever,? Mrs. Palgrave; ?The Knight and his
lady fair,? Miss Walton ; ? The maid of Judah,?
Mrs. Edgar; ? What are the wild waves saying,?
Miss Lowe and Miss Denny; ?The last rose of
summer,? Miss Sullivan ; ? Good-bye, sweetheart,
good-bye,? Miss Francis; ?I dreamt a dream,?
Miss Fenwick ; ? My Jamie, thou wertkind to me,?
Mrs. Thomas; ?The clang of the wooden Shoon,?
Miss Molloy ; ? Too late,? Miss Williams ; ? Airy,
fairy Lilian,? Miss Maclin ; ?The Red, White, and
Blue,? Mrs. Palgrave; who invited the whole
audience to join in the chorus. It is needless to say
this was done in the most patriotic and hearty
fashion by all.
Our British Sailors.
January 24.?1 have just been at sea a month and
three days. I have amused myself latterly by
watching and studying the lives and habits of the
sailors on board. We, as a maritime nation, must
necessarily feel an interest in all appertaining to the
sea. Our British sailors must above all things be
objects of interest to their countrymen, whether
they be in the navy, or any other service. It is they
who are really the most actively conducive to
England?s wealth and England?s greatness. We are
a sca-loving people. What stirs our liveliest
sympathies more than a good swinging sea song ?
What English man or woman does not love the
national standard, the Union Jack ? We feel proud
of it anywhere, but when we see it flying in foreign
ports our hearts beat with the deepest pride when
we contemplate?
? That flag that waves o?er every sea,
No matter when or where,
And to treat that flag as ought but the free,
Is more than the strongest dare.
For the lion spirits that tread the deck,
Have carried the palm of the brave,
And that flag may sink with a shot-torn wreck,
But never float over a slave.
A few brief details of a sailor?s life on active duty
may not be uninteresting, or out of place in these
pages.
We often hear people say, ? ? Are not sailors very
idle at sea ? What can they find to do P? This is a
very natural mistake, and being very frequently
made, it is one which every sailor feels an interest in
having corrected.
?The morning commences with the watch on
decks ?turning to? at daybreak and washing down,
scrubbing and swabbing the decks. This, together
with filling the scuttled butt with fresh water, and
coiling up the rigging, usually occupies the time
until seven bells (half-past seven) when all hands get
breakfast. At eight the day?s work begins and lasts
until sundown, with the exception of an hour for
dinner.?
? ? The discipline of the ship requires every man to
be at work on something when he is on deck, except
at night or Sundays. At all other times you will
never man on hoard a well-ordered vessel,
standing idle on deck, sitting down, or leaning over
the side. It is the officers? duty to keep everyone


at work, even if there is nothing to he done hut to
scrape the rust from the chain cables. In no state
prison are the convicts more regularly set to work
and more closely watched. No conversation is
allowed among the crew at their duty, and though
they frequently do talk when aloft, or when near
one another, yet they always stop when an officer is
nigh.?
?When first leaving port, studding sail gear is to
he rove, all the running rigging to be examined;
then the standing rigging is to ho overhauled,
repaired and replaced, and repaired in a thousand
different ways ; and wherever any of the numberless
ropes or yards are chafing or wearing upon it, their
chafing gear, as they call it, must he put on. This
chafing gear consists of worming, parcelling,
rounders, battens, and service of all kinds?rope,
yarns, spun y r arn, marline and seizing stuffs.?
?The next point to he considered is, that all the
small stuff, which is used on hoard a ship?such as
spun yarn, marline, and seizing stuff, are all made
on hoard. The owners of a vessel buy up an
incredible number of ?old junk? which the sailors
unlay, after drawing out the yarns, knot them
together and roll them up in balls. These ? rope
yarns? are constantly used for various purposes, hut
the greater part is manufactured into spun yarn.
For this purpose every vessel is furnished with a
spun y T arn winch, which is very simple, consisting of
a wheel and spindle. This may he heard constantly
on deck in pleasant weather; another method of
employing the crew is setting up ? rigging.? When-
ever any of the standing rigging becomes slack
(which is continually happening) the seizings and
coverings must be taken off, tackles got up, and,
after the rigging is bowsed well taut, the seizings
and coverings replaced which is a very nice piece of
work. There is also such a connection between
different parts of a vessel, that one rope can seldom
he touched without altering another. You cannot
stay a mast aft by the hack stays without slacking
up the head stays, &c., &c. If we add to this all the
tarring, greasing, oiling, varnishing, painting,
scraping, and scrubbing, which is required in the
course of a long voyage, and also remember this is all
to he done in addition to watching at night, steering,
reefing, furling, bracing, making and setting sail, and
pulling, hauling, and climbing in every direction,
one will hardly ask, What can a sailor find to do at
sea ??
Sunday is to them something of a holiday?only
one watch is kept on deck at a time. The men are
dressed in their Sunday?s best, which consists of
white duck trousers and red or checked shirts ?they
have nothing to do but to make the necessary changes
in the sails. They amuse themselves by reading,
smoking, talking, spinning yarns and mending their
clothes. It is astonishing how handy sailors are
with the needle, and what ingenious trifles they very
often turn out. I remember seeing an artistic pin-
cushion made by a sailor at sea that would have
done honour and credit to the ? Art Needlework
Society? had one of their members produced it.
There are many curious customs at sea which we
? land lubbers,? as the sons of Neptune comtemp-
tuously call us, know nothing about.
? Chalking the Boot ?
Is one for instance. I remember well the occasion
that we made our first general expedition to the
forecastle. On the first step of the ladder to the
bewilderment of the uninitiated, we were with the
exception of two, each chalked on the boot by a
hidden foe. A canny Scot, however, succeeded in
gaining the deck without the mark, and anticipating
a catch, with his native caution, attempted to holt.
A smart A.B. made a rush, and slipping up grabbed
him by the knees, and administered the chalk with
unsparing hands. The hardy Northerner turned
pale, and we expected to see him discharge a volley
of liquid grape-shot over the enemy, but it turned
out that fear of being thrown overboard was the
cause of the change of color. The only one of the
party who escaped to tell the tale was a ? ? knowing
gintleman? from the ? sister-island,? who could
not he ?blarneyed? into leaving his sacred poop again.
?The most curious of all customs is
? Burying the Dead Morse.?
Sailors on joining a vessel bound for Australia are
advanced one month?s wages and they celebrate the
end of that time by ?burying the dead horse? ;
they do so in the following manner: With their
advanced pay they are supposed to have brought a
horse which died at the eud of the month. A dummy
horse is made, the foundation consisting of an old
flour cask. It is stuffed with straw ?the shape of
the horse pretty r well defined?and neatly covered
with canvas. After painting the nostrils red and
the feet black, and fixing a flowing mane and tail of
spun yarn, finely corded, a hole is cut in the back of
spun yarn, finely corded, a hole is cut in the back of
the horse in the usual place of the saddle. The
ceremony commenced at 7.30 p.m. A procession
then came forward which consisted of a man in a
soldier?s tunic, scotch cap, white trousers, carrying
a mop sick with the head well wrapped up, with
a man?s head painted on it. Then came the pence
collector with a can, long white whiskers, and long
overcoat: then came the mock policemen, who in-
dulged in a little pantomime of their own, clearing
the way by swinging their staves, but so that no
one was injured. The staves were made of canvas
stuffed with straw, or inflated bladders. The pro-
cession closed by a number of sailors who marched
two by two, then all paraded round the decks several
times singing, and collecting all the stray pence they
could get.
After this procession came a second, consisting of
a host of various characters. A nigger playing a
trombone, an old man in a cocked hat playing a
concertina, and three other musicians, each playing
a pan to represent a drum, a tin whistle, and a Jew?s
harp. One of the principal characters then ap-
peared, the auctioneer, attended by his clerk with
a roll of paper. They were followed by the horse,
led by a groom attired in a red jersey, white
breeches, cap, and top boots. The horse was ridden
by a sailor dressed in white tights and jockey cap,
whose body fitted through the hole cut in the animal,
which was suspended from the shoulders. After
this came numerous other characters. The auc-
tioneer then mounted a barrel on the quarter deck
?made a most eloquent harangue about the good
qualities of the horse, and descanted with great
warmth on the famous races it had won. The
bidding then commenced at �l, and the horse was
finally knocked down at �l2. A collection is made
on board before the festival from the passengers,
which is presented to the sailors by one of the
ladies. The bids cease when they reach the sum
already collected. After the final bid all moved
to the lee side, near the main sail. A solemn chant
was then sung, each verse ending with ? Poor old
horse.? The jockey in the meantime had fastened
himself into a seat at the end of a rope, then the
horse was attached to the seat under the man as
if he were astride it. A blue light was then fired

which lit up the ?whole ship, the man and horse
were hoisted up to the yard end, and the jockey
then cut the rope that fastened the ? Poor old
horse,? which fell with a terrific splash into the
sea. The jockey came down the rigging and was
soon on deck. The final procession then went round
the decks singing ?Rule Britannia.? Three cheers
were given for the ladies, the captain, the officers,
the passengers, and the crew. Thus ended the
festival of the ?Dead Horse,? which I witnessed
on hoard the Sea Gull.
January 21th. ?Being a calm fine evening we had
a vcrj r enjoyable dance on deck, and a few im-
promptu songs. It is now getting intensely hot
?the thermometer being 86 degrees in the shade.
We now remain on deck as much as possible, and
every precaution is taken as to cleanliness and ven-
tilation in order to ensure the general health?
which I am thankful to say is very good.
January 30 th.- ?Yesterday we sighted a ship home-
ward hound, and I am glad I was enabled to send
home a line or two to a valued friend whom I
had left in the old country?everyone on board
experienced the same joyous feeling, as it was the
first opportunity we have had of communicating
with England.
Motes or* the Weather.
The notes of the weather and position of the ship
from January 15th to the 30th are as follows :
January \bth. ?Light S.W. breeze and cloudy.
January 16 th. ?Similar winds.
January 11th. ?Fair wind at last, after so many
days of head winds. F.ow welcome it is. Isles of
Palma and Ferro in sight.
January 18 th to 21 st. ?Spoke the barque ladybird ,
28 days from the Tyne, bound for Rio. We are
now fairly in tropics, and shall pass the Isle of
St. Antonio to-night, just 1,200 miles from the
line.
January 22nd. ?Our run was 251 miles.
January 23 rd. ?246 miles.
January 24 th. ?Only 188 miles. Light winds,
thunder, lightning, rain. Calms and heat up to
the 29th.
January 29 th. ?Spoke a Dutch barge, but did not
land her.
January 3 0th. ?Since the 21st we have been
straight on our course of 1,109 miles, and have now
the first of the wished for S.E. trade-winds.
Illumination at Sea.
February 2. ?Last night I witnessed a very bril-
liant phenomena of nature?a phosphorescent illu-
mination of the sea. The sky at the horizon was
of an intense blackness ; overhead thick fleecy clouds
obscured the moon which now and then showed itself
for a moment to disappear the next, the whole waste
of waters appeared one sheet of silvery light, and
now and again the spray thrown up into the air
by the breaking of the waves appeared like minia-
ture fountains of silvery pearls. It was, indeed, a
weird and lovely scene, it seemed so strange to be
sailing on a sea of liquid silver, that I felt as if
I really had entered the realms of Fairyland. For a
while I gave myself up to the enchantment of the
hour?forgot that I was a denizen of earth voyaging
to another sphere to earn my living by the sweat
of my brow. I seemed, as it were, to lose my
identity in that harmony of black and silver, when
suddenly the spell was broken, the moon burst forth
in dazzling radiance, dispersing the gloom around,
and the silvery landscape gradually faded from my
view like a lovely and enchanting vision.
As ennui and weariness of the constant monotony
of the same old scenes began to manifest itself, the
committee of the ?Universal Enlivener? was called
upon to exert its varied and talented powers to
amuse, so after grave deliberation we determined
to give, for a change, a ?Christy Minstrel? enter-
tainment of a first-class character. We decided the
performers should consist of gentlemen only. We
returned the compliment to the ladies by inviting
them all. After various songs, character clog
dances, the performance was to conclude by a
whimsical ?nigger? farce, composed by the res-
pected chairman, and entitled ?Lotted Pollster.?
We fixed it for the 6th. The weather gets hotter
and hotter now, and it is believed in a day or
two we shall cross the line. All sorts of bets are
going on about the day and hour we shall accom-
plish that happy feat, notwithstanding the swelter-
ing heat I must go and practice a breakdown
with Sambo, for in the coming farce I have to go
through various extravagancies all caused through
drinking too much Yankee Cock-tail, and eating too
much ?Lotted Pobster.? I feel literally stewed ?
if you know what that delightful sensation is?l
will try and simmer down a bit over a cigar and
a bottle of Bass before commencing my arduous
labours. Every one of the Christy?s are all hard
at work rehearsing their parts, and the rest are
all in a state of expectancy.
Crossing the Line.
February 7. ?Yesterday was a very eventful one.
At 12 o?clock a notice was posted through the ship
that we were in latitude 0 - 03 S. We all felt glad
that we had crossed the line, though I do not
suppose one person could explain why. We have
got into the S.E. trade winds and are going ahead,
and there is every appearance of our having a fair
voyage to the end. Our entertainment came on that
day, very apropos to celebrate the event, and the
Captain further celebrated it by giving a Ball after
the performances.
The Christy Minstrel Entertain-
ment.
It can truthfully be stated that the Entertainment
gave the greatest satisfaction, and caused infinite
amusement, at the time and since.
The programme was as follows :
Comic Recitation, Mr. T. Black; ? ? Happy with
thee, Love,? Mr. Lovejoy; ?The river sang its
sweetest song,? Mr. G. Waters ; ? Paddy was there
with his stick,? Mr. D. Wood; ? Baby, mine,? Mr.
F. Fathers; Characteristic Songs and Breakdowns,
Sambo and Mr. Goodwill; ? ? Over the Garden Wall, ? ?
Mr. C. Jumper; Comic Narrative, Mr. F. Black:
? Waiting,? Mr. T. Hope; ? ?Tis but a little faded
flower,? Mr. G. Rox ; ?Johnny was a Piper,? Mr.
D. Wood; ?The American National Guard,? Mr.
G. Waters ; ? Madame La Sharty,? Mr. F. Fattiers;
Clog Dances, Messrs. F. Black and T. Hope;
? Massa?s sent a Jelly-gram,? Mr. Goodwill. To
conclude with the Whimsical Farce, entitled:
? Lotted Fobstcr
Supported by the whole Company.
Everyone acquitted himself with eclat. The comic
recital and the comic narrative were so good, that all
on board considered that they had had a treat.
A Paradise.
February 12. ?One of my great chums. Poor
fellow ! seems awfully sick. He is going to stay for
a fortnight at Adelaide with a friend, and is then
going to his uncle in New Zealand. I do all I


can to keep up his spirits, and to console him I
gave him a letter which a gentleman visiting New
Zealand had sent to a friend of mine in England
who forwarded it to me. It runs as follows:
??lf the needy millions of my countrymen only
knew the glorious chances of gaining a competency
for themselves and offspring, which await them in
that great country of New Zealand, how quickly
would they throw off the yoke of poverty and
wretchedness, and hastening with their strength and
sinews to that Land of Plenty,??of glorious soil
and almost perfect climate which is eager to receive
them, would look back in wonder on the stupidity?
I may say the madness?of delaying the steps so
long. Teeming with agricultural acres; full of
mineral wealth, medicinal, and other treasures; redo-
lent of perfumes from natural flowers ; and the
most picturesque scenery in the whole world?it
may be termed Paradise. But the above picture
is principally for the working and agricultural
classes. The Eden seems to have been created solely
for them; at all events, at present, as there is no
chance of comparatively none for the more refined
member of the ?genius home ? For instance, those
who have been brought up to wear ?kids ? and
?patent leathers? had much better remain at
?home,? for nothing can exceed the tales of misery
of many professional persons whom I have en-
countered here. Lawyers, clerks, waiters, shopmen,
actors, &c., are all drugs in the market. It is only
the stone-cutters, the hricklajers, the smiths, the
road-makers, farmers and farm-labourers, who are
wanted here, unless he it understood they may have
a little capital to start with. Then there are chances
for them in a hundred different ways, which they
can never hope to meet with in England. The city
of Auckland alone is one of the most thriving and
delightful in the Colonics, and one of the cheapest
to live in. Imagine rump steaks at 4d. a pound,
and as for houses, a four-roomed cottage with
verandah all round, and an acre of ground, fer
fourteen shillings per week and no taxes. And
when I inform you that mechanics command double
pay for work done,| I think it will be readily
acknowledged that it is ? the home for the working
man.?
This letter seemed quite to cheer him up, and he
seemed day by day to look forward to the future
most hopefully.
Sports and Pastimes.
February 16.?A pedestrian feat was undertaken
by Mr. A. Wood, to walk five miles in one hour,
over a length of fifteen yards marked out on the
ship, commenced his task at four o?clock on Wednes-
day afternoon, the 3rd inst.
The distance was carefully measured on the port
spar deck, and the number of turns and the time
were noted by two time-keepers (Mr. Black and Mr.
White), and an umpire (Mr. Brown).
Mr. Wood, who did his work in excellent style
all through, got over the first mile in 13 mins.
3 secs., and the following ones in 12 mins. 45 secs.,
12 mins. 305., 12 mins. 45 secs., and 12min. 55 sec.,
respectively, thus completing the 5 miles in 63 mins.
40 secs.
This, considering the difficulties of the per-
formance on the slippery deck of a vessel in motion,
and having to make no less than 586 turns in the
time, certainly speaks well for the pedestrian powers
of future Australian settlers.
Mutiny.
February 20. ?Yesterday a very distressing and
unlooked for occurrence happened. A goodly num-
her of seamen mutinied because their pea soup was
not properly cooked. One of the men complained
to the Captain, who promised to sec into the matter,
and ordered meat to he cooked for their tea. This
did not satisfy them?soon after both watches re-
fused to work, and as this amounted to ? ? mutiny
on the high seas,? the men were at once charged
and put in irons. Captain Howard suggested that a
volunteer crew should he selected from the emi-
grants. The saloon passengers gave in their names
immediately, and twenty-five from the steerage were
found willing to form the two watches. It must
have been gratifying to the Captain to find sufficient
passengers to support his power and authority.
Next morning the mutineers, 16 in number, came
to their senses, and were willing to return to their
work. Captain Howard at once released them from
their irons, and they vigorously commenced their
duties. He also specially thanked the passengers
for the able manner in which they had supported
him. Three cheers were given for the Captain and
the volunteer crew, in which the unblushing offenders
heartily joined.
Tlie End of our Journey.
March 3.?To-day the sunrise was remarkable for
a display of coloured clouds unlike what we have
been accustomed to see in northern skies. Although
the heavens were blue and clear, yet all around
the horizon, and especially in the part near the
rising sun, hanks of vapour clouds seemed to he
constantly generating, or changing their form,
sometimes appearing as if they were precipitating
heavy rains, sometimes more as if they were drawing
vapour from the water. Dense masses about the
sun were almost a golden red?the sun itself break-
ing through like a disc of burnished gold, while
far on each side towards north and south a dull
blood-red streak shewed through the vapour near
the horizon.
March 4.?This evening there was also a beautiful
sunset?a clear blue sky above, changing gradually
lower down, and a delicate green, which seems
peculiar to Australian skies, and low streaky clouds
near the horizon richly tinged with various colours
both before and after the bright golden sunset. The
disc of the sun disappeared behind a straight bank
of dark cloud, looking like a flat table land, while
lower down light vapoury clouds seem to rise from
the surface of the water at the horizon, in front
of this dark hank.
During this time there was generally at night
a brilliant effect of phosphoric light to be seen in
the wake of the ship, remarkable for the large size
of the blotches of light, which were also to he
observed here and there for considerable distances
in the undisturbed water on both sides, like floating
lanthorns, and which are said to he caused by some
gelatinous animals called by the sailors, ? sea
cucumbers.? The ship has been continually fol-
lowed by large numbers of birds, including a few
Cape pigeons and an occasional gigantic albatross,
but chiefly by molly-hawks, fine large birds, some
of which have been caught measuring from 6-ft.
to 7-ft. from tip to tip of the wings.
After another fortnight?s repetition of similar
incidents and amusements which I have sufficiently
described in the foregoing chapters, we sighted
Kangaroo Island. All had watched with strained
and eager gaze for the first sight of land, which
we had almost been deprived of for now nearly
three months. The re-action was great. Tears
of delight and relief came into our eyes as we caught
the first glimpse of the long looked-for haven well
nigh in view.


Many a time and oft does memory recall the faces
of our loving friends left behind, in spite of the
numerous acquaintances formed during the passage;
to part from those who have shared the many little
troubles and pleasures of the voyage with us for
the past three months, and whom we have learned
to regard as sisters or brothers, will cause many
a tear to flow when again separated from friends
whom they love.
Only a few hours now will bring us to Semaphore,
which is the name of the piace we land at, before
reaching the capital of the colony of South Aus-
tralia?Adelaide. The end of our journey being
now so close, our good doctor could not resist calling
us together to give us a few farewell words. He
advised those possessing capital to gain some ex-
perience of the colony before investing it; and, in
the course of a few kindand encouraging remarks, told
those who had to depend solely on their strong arms
and willing hearts, to remember the respect enter-
tained for labour in the colonies, and advised them
to accept the first situations which were offered and
not to be too particular as to the precise nature of
the work. He also referred to the evils produced
by drink in hot climates, and warned his hearers
to resist its temptations.
He went on to say, that when some who were
now present saw in after years their children and
grand-children thriving and prosperous, some earn-
ing their bread in comfort, others in positions of
independence, and others perhaps wealthy and among
the great ones of that land, by which that time
would itself be great; and when they contrasted
their position in Australia with that which it would
have been at home, striving to earn a bare sub-
sistence, jostled by their fellow-workers in the
daily struggle for existence; and when they look
back and remember that they owed their prosperity
to the step which they were now taking, in so
wisely and bravely leaving the over-populated
country of their birth, they would bless the day
they left Great Britain, and the good old ship that
carried them over. At this point the doctor was
interrupted by a burst of applause, after which he
resumed, saying, that the picture which he set before
them was no fool?s paradise, but likely to turn
out a reality to all those who would combine per-
severance with sobriety and industry. Without
these, he reminded his hearers, success could not
be achieved; and he bade tflem bear this in mind
that in every country, new or old, the drunkard
and the idler must sink into poverty and obscurity.
He concluded his remarks by thankiug the
audience for the kind way in which they had
listened to him; and assured them, that when the
time of parting came, and he wished them ?God-
speed,? they would carry with them his warmest
wishes for their health, long life, and prosperity
in their new homes.
Landing in a Colony.
The first thing that emigrants generally do on
landing is to make themselves ill by a jollification,
followed by stuffing in fish and fruit for a week
or two,_ and then to fall into very desponding spirits,
and write home despairing letters.
The wise plan is to commence by taking a series
of baths, warm or cold according to the season, to
eat very sparingly of fresh meat, bread, or fruit,
and other viands too delicious to the sea-traveller
wearied of salt junk, preserved meat, and all the
makeshifts, for the produce of gardens and pastures.
Walks or rides, or both, will be found much needed
to get rid of extra flesh accumulated in weeks of
idleness. Neither mind nor body is worth much
when out of condition.
The capitalist will commence a round of visits and
dinner parlies preparatory to a tour of exploration.
The family man of small capital will take a cheap
cottage or unfurnished rooms for his family before
deciding on future progress. If possible he will
engage a cottage as soon as he leaves the ship, so
as to save the extravagant charges of inns and
hotels. The single man of moderate means will
take refuge in a boarding-house. All, no matter
whether they have ten thousand or one hundred
pounds to invest, will, if they are wise, allow at
least one year to elapse before deciding on any
investment, however tempting.
Although it is more possible to do without money
in a colony than in an old country, money is more
valuable and increases faster in a colony, and there-
fore it is a great point to save as much as possible ;
in fact, it is one of the great advantages of cutting
off the entail of old connections by emigration, that
it enables you to save.
To this end the newly-arrived colonist cannot
begin too soon. According to our experience it is
very seldom worth while, even in England, to lay
out half or a quarter, even ten, per cent, of your
fortune. Some strenuously advise gentlemen obliged
by ?the pressure from without? to keep up the
externals of his birth or education to the last:
with Bamaby Rudge?s raven they exclaim, when-
ever an economical maxim presents itself, ?Never
say die!? and so out of the poor scrapings of his
fortune they make him take a cabin passage. They
give him introductions to the most genteel people,
they lead him to put up at the most fashionable
hotels, and spend a small fortune in paying and
receiving visits.
This line of conduct often leaves the victim of
gentility stranded, without a shilling, obliged to
beg, or borrow, or sponge; but then he never can
be reproached, if he should afterwards attain a
wealthy position, with having come out as a ? steer-
age passenger ? ?a direful reproach, although one
which may be borne with considerable equanimity
by a man who owes no one a shilling, who has
never borrowed or begged in the colony, and can
show a fair number of stock, and a respectable
credit at his banker?s.
Poor men, however genteel as cabin passengers,
find themselves led into a great deal of expense by
wealthy cuddy companions, and on landing have
great difficulty in breaking off the acquaintance.
Our advice about passage-money, about lodgings,
and about dress, is to begin as you mean to go on.
Never mind what any one may say: if you have
to stay in a town, and very little money, take such
an empty room or cottage as you can afford, and
make shift with your ship furniture?as many have
done within our knowledge. A gentleman by birth,
education, and profession, walked up the street of
the port until he saw an empty cottage to his mind,
hired it, and then returned for his baggage and
family, without even having entered an inn.
In a strange place a bank credit for twenty pounds
is worth much more than any number of polite
speeches.


AUSTRALIA.
Australia, formerly known as New Holland, lies
entirely in the southern hemisphere; one-third of
its surface being north of the tropic of Capricorn.
It is an Island, hut of such vast dimensions, that
it is now designated the Fifth Continent. From
Cape York, its extreme northern point to Cape
AVilson, its extreme southern point, measures
1,900 miles. From its most easterly point. Cape
Byron, to its most westerly point, Cape Inscription,
the distance is 2,600. Its entire coast line embraces
a circuit of 8,000 miles, and its total area may be
roughly estimated at 3,000,000.
Australia is bounded on the north by the Indian
Ocean and the Torres Strait, separating it from the
large Island of Papua or New Guinea ;on the south
by the Southern Ocean ; on the east by the Pacific
Ocean ; on the west by the Indian Ocean.
In the year 1551 "it was first sighted by the
Provencals. It was also visited on different occa-
sions by the Dutch and Portuguese. The first
permanent settlement was made in 1788, when
Governor Philip founded the city of Sydney. Then
commenced the gradual opening up of the country
by Anglo-Saxon enterprise, until it became one of
the most promising and successful of all England?s
colonies. In the midst of the most absolute bar-
barism, civilization slowly and surely evolved itself ;
tbe foot of civilised man gradually usurped that of
the savage. His desultory and scattered villages
became stately cities and emporiums of luxury and
wealth, the waste and improvident lands were con-
verted into cultivated fields?treasures of golden
grain and golden harvests. Instead of the howl of
the wild dog and the tramp of the emu, is heard
the happy sound of the ploughshare and the scythe ;
in the place of barren wilds spring up large and
prosperous farms. By the hand of cultivated man
its hills became purple with the luscious grape; the
secret recesses of the earth made to disgorge their
gems and gold; the hidden depths of the seas to
yield up their priceless pearls. By the side of the
wild and splendid forests of mahogany and sandal
wood, spring into view magnificent groves of the
orange and the citron, tbe pomegranate and the
guava; while the plum, the peach, the fig, the
banana, the jack fruit, and the pine apple, give
ample evidence of its luxurious and teeming soil.
It is by the intelligence, indomitable energy, and
unflagging industry of Australia?s early colonists
that she owes her present prosperity, greatness, and
fame. Even now there are huge tracts of land
where tbe foot of man has never trod. Who knows
what vast resources of prosperity and wealth lie
waiting there for the hardy adventurer could he only
reach them ? and of course the day will come when
he will reach them, when the Continent of the
Southern seas will be one mighty area of cultivation
and civilization.
The Colonies.
Australia is now divided into six Colonies, viz.:?
I.?AYestern Australia, including a vast extent of
territory.
2.?South Australia, lying between Yictoria, New
South Wales and Queensland on the east, and
AY estem Australia on the west. This colony runs
right across the Continent, and the northerly por-
of his strip is called the ?Northern Territory'.?
3. ?Victoria, occupying the south eastern extremity
of the Continent.
4. ?Tasmania, an island lying to the southward
part of the east coast.
5. ?New South Wales, occupying the southern
part of the east coast, and stretching westward as
far as the boundary line of South Australia.
6. ?Queensland, lying north from New South
Wales, and comprising the north eastern portion of
the Continent.
The Physical Aspect
of Australia is most peculiar. A plate turned upside
down would not be a bad illustration, for it is one
vast tableland studded with diminutive mountains
and has an edging of fertile sea board varying in
depth from one to two hundred milts. It appears
that the most curious features of Australian geology'
is the absence of a secondary formation. The main
tableland rests on tertiary' sandstone overlying
primary rock. Describing the country geologically
a great authority, Mr. Ranken thus speaks of it??
?The great plain appears to have been, at one
period, a plateau of sandstone, for tbe edges of this,
where highest and apparently less reduced by denu-
dation, are of that sediment; and the interior,
although washed and scooped out in places, shows
nothing against this view. Upon the south margin
it presents walls of sandstone cliffs, tbe edge of a
seemingly interminable plateau. Upon the west
this sandstone saliferous and ferruginous, with
marshes laden with salt and gypsum, is interrupted
by granite. The northern watershed shows, in
places, sandstone plateaux and cliffs and desei?ts of
loose sand. And the eastern margin of the great
plain is generally a sandstone tablsland, sometimes
washed down in wide smooth gaps by its subsidences
and emergencies, often interrupted by volcanic over-
flows. Thus the soils are very similar, if not iden-
tical, throughout the great inland plain ; but differing
upon the eastern and western margins, as these are
interrupted by different igneous rocks, the former
often trappean, the latter granitic. The strips of
country which occupy the sea-board between the
western, northern, and eastern margins of the plain
and the ocean, are, however, more varied. For it
is in this belt of coast country that there are more
of indeed nearly all the upheavals of strata and
volcanic interruptions to the formations which, with
the irregularities of surface that permit of more
alluvial deposits, give a richer and more varied
character to the land. The soil, as the climate, has
therefore more variety and power of production
coastwise than towards the interior. The soil, as
the climate, is generally more miserable, forbidding,
and monotonous as the flat interior is reached, and
more promising as the mountainous coast lands are
entered, particularly towards the eastern seaboard.
The south coast is itself the margin of this inland
plain of sterile sand. The north coast is 200 miles
or more from the edge of the interior region, but
it often shows plateaus of sand, even to its northern
extremities. On the west coast an undulating table-
land of syenite or granite falls westward, but without
volcanic rocks intruding to much extent south-east
between Spencer?s Gulf and the Darling, meridional
upheavals have occurred, as along the east coast,


giving increased power of production to the land,
in soil and climate. But all the east and north-east
coast-country is upraised, broken, and interrupted
by volcanic action. The great Cordillera has been
rent in many places, and floods of basalt and trap
have swept over the sterile plains, spurs and parallel
ranges have again broken the surface east and west
of the main ridge ; extinct volcanoes have covered
immense number of acres with the richest soils, and
all in varied temperatures near the sea.?
The theory with regard to Australia is that it was
a sudden upheaval of land by volcanic disturbance,
which had hitherto been submerged in the sea. It
appears that even now the northern coast is still
imperceptibly upheaving.
The Rivers.
There are very few navigable rivers in Australia.
The chief rivers in the north are the Albert, the
Roper, the Adelaide, and Victoria. The latter is
considered one of the finest rivers, but after every
appearance of magnificence for a course of 300 miles,
it suddenly dwindles into utter insignificance. That
is a peculiar feature with most Australian rivers.
Those in the south are the Murray, the Yarra-
Yarra, and the Glenelg; in the East the Burdekin,
the Fitzroy, the Brisbane, the Clarence, the Rich-
mond, the Tweed, the Manning, the Hunter, the
Hawkesbury, and others; in the west, the Swan
River, the Murchison, the Fortescue, and the De
Grey.
The lakes of Australia are quite unworthy of
mention. Its
Slays and Gulfs,
however, to a great extent, make up for the insig-
nificance of its rivers and lakes; they are truly
magnificent. The chief gulfs are the Gulf of
Carpentaria, and St. Vincent and Spencer. The
chief ports and bays are Keppel Bay, Moreton Bay,
Port Stephen, Broken Bay, Port Jackson, Port
Denison, Botany Bay, Jervis Bay, Twofold Bay,
Port Philip, Portland Bay, and the Great Bight.
Tasmania possesses fine hays and harbours, the
most prominent being Stone Bay, Oyster Bay, Port
Dalrymple, and Macquarie Harbour.
Islands.
Not any of the islands of Australia are of any
consequence except Tasmania, of which we shall
fully treat further on. The next in size is Kan-
garoo Island; although a hundred miles in length
it is quite useless for agricultural purposes. It is
covered with dense scrub, and has a very scanty
supply of water. Then comes Nuyt?s Archipelago
on the western coast. Amongst others may be
specially named Dirk Harley?s Island, Doere Island,
Barow Island, and the Dampier Archipelago.
On the north coast are Bathurst Island and
Melville Island, and separated from each other by
a narrow arm of the sea called Aps�y Strait, and
together forming a breakwater to Van Diemen?s
Gulf. On the east coast are Wessel Island, Sir
Edward Pellew?s Island, and Wellesley Island;
off Cape Yoi'k there are a mass of Islands with
which the Torres Straits is every whore studded with,
and which extend the whole distance to Now Guinea.
Mr. Montgomery Martin described the seas of those
islands as follows:?? The beautiful light of the
tropics is increased by the reflection of the nearly
colourless bottom, covered with various molluscs,
some perfectly transparent, others of various hues ;
fish of all sizes, shapes and colours are seen; the
voracious shark eagerly pursuing his prey; the
turtle rolling along in his unwieldy shell, and sea-
snakes of large dimensions, and of glowing lustre,
may be traced in their rapid gliding movements
as clearly as if they were flying in the air.?
The Aborigines
of Australia are a wandering race scattered over all
parts of the country ; they are most numerous on
the coast or by permanent rivers. Those tribes on
the coast are superior to those inland, being people
of finer physical appearance, and of a more warlike
nature, some of the tribes numbering hundreds of
warriors. Those inland are vastly inferior, and can
hardly be classed as tribes, but more as families
of miserable savages. The produce of the river,
the sea, and the forest entirely supports them. Mr.
Ranken says: ?The inferiority of the Aboriginal
race is shown more by its extremely low standard
of intellect than by its numerical weakness. The
race is without vigour, much less ferocity, or warlike
energy : it is listless, by no means aggressive; it
is hold down by the continual struggle with nature,
and only survives as a wretched specimen of hu-
manity. Some races are conquered or spoilt by the
luxuriant kindness of nature, as in tropical gar-
dens ; an d others are overcome in the fight against
starvation, as in the polar wastes. But here we
have a race first enervated by a mild temperate
climate, which has no winter nor a regularity of
season, and then subjected to uncertain extremes
of drought and famine. The coldest season in Aus-
tralia, except upon the highest southern ranges, can-
not be called a winter; it requires no provision to be
made against it, so the people have no thought of to-
morrow ; they are utterly improvident. The driest
and the wettest season cannot be foretold; they
occur at ever-varying intervals, not of months, but
of years; they cannot he anticipated, so the people
are careless, listless, and hopeless in calamity. The
struggles required to survive are frequent and severe,
but the mild climate never braces her children for
that struggle. Intellectually, as physically, the race
is poor and weak. Ignorant beyond comparison,
they are abjectly subject to terror, yet have not
acquired a mythology, nor any one general super-
stition. In the darkest forest, beneath the highest
mountains, by the dreary silent lakes of the southern
highlands, they have retained the tradition of some
animal, and have some common feeling approaching
a superstition regarding it. White men came and
spoke of a devil. Now, the step is short from
their ?hanyip? to this ?devil?; so they learnt a
superstition. But it is not indigenous. Where
there is no tradition of an extinct animal, as in
the north of the continent, there is neither banyip
nor devil; few aboriginals have any such idea, even
from white men. It has been stated that they have
an idea of the Supreme Being and of the transmi-
gration of souls; but he who has been conversant
with untutored ?black fellows,? he who has spent
weeks and months with his black boy riding along-
side daily, and camping at the same fire nightly, and
who has thoroughly surveyed that savage?s mental
range, knows well that there is not only no glim-
mering of such conceptions in that mind, but that
these are quite beyond the grasp of such a weak
intelligence.?
The stature of the Australian savage is consider-
ably less than that of the European, the women
in proportion being much shorter than the men.
The Australian natives are always called ?blacks,?
but their real colour is a purplish copper hue. They
have thick black hair, hazel eyes, yellow and blood
shot, high cheek bones, projecting brows, broad


depressed noses, large but not unpleasant mouths,
narrow jawbones and retreating chins, and teeth
of exquisite whiteness. Both men and women have
a very peculiar and disagreeable odour caused by
rubbing their heads with the entrails of a fish, and
then standing in the sun till the oil runs down their
head and shoulders. They wear no clothing?in
the winter some make rugs of opossum skins or
blankets made by beating out the inner bark of
the tea-tree, after it has gone through certain stages
of soaking. When a native is going to fight, or
to any festive occasion, he marks every rib in his
body with a stripe of white ochre. His hair, after
being plentifully oiled, is plastered with red ochre,
and decorated with feathers. Their process of tat-
tooing is peculiar, they cut gashes with a shell
in their flesh, and stuff them with clay. The flesh
being unable to heal developes into raised wounds
of which they are vastly proud.
The Australian native is essentially idle. He
never dreams of cultivating the soil, nor has he
any fixed abode, but is continually wandering from
point to point wherever ho can get most food.
Native Weapons.
Their chief weapon of defence is the spear, which
they throw with extraordinary dexterity. The
? boomerang? is a weapon specially used for hunt-
ing. Their shields are oval in shape, and made
of a very light wood ?about two feet in length
and five inches in width.
Their clubs, known as ? waddies,? or ? nulla-
nullas,? can be used either to brain an adversary,
or to settle a wife.
The canoes of the natives are good and substantial,
chopped, or burnt out of a solid log. The hatchets
are made of stone. In the more settled districts
they all manage to obtain iron tomahawks. Their
baskets are made of split cane cr grass, and the
nets for catching fish from the fibres of various plants.
Food.
The food of the native consists of snakes, iguanas,
lizards, grubs of all kinds, and the larva) of ants
?the huge cream-coloured maggot found in the
bark of the swamp oak is esteemed as especially
delicious. The emu, the wallaby, the wild duck,
and every available fish, animal, or bird, are used
for food ?the only thing they do not eat is the leach.
1 ? Corrobbory.?
The natives frequently indulge in a ? corrobbory ?
or dance. An extract from Mr. Angur?s book called
?Savage Life in Australia,? and which fully des-
cribes this amusement, cannot fail to be interesting
??The performers were divined into five distinct
classes, the greater body comprising about twenty-
five young men, including five or six boys, painted
and decorated as follows: ?In nudity, except tho
ynodna, which is made expressly for the occasion,
with bunches of gum leaves tied round the legs
just above the knee, which, as they stamped about,
made a loud swishing noise. In their hands they
held a katta or icirra, and some a few gum leaves.
The former were held at arm?s length, and struck
alternately with their legs as they stamped. They
were painted from each shoulder down to the hips
with five or six white stripes rising from tho breast;
their faces also with white perpendicular lines, mak-
ing the most hideous appearance; these were the
dancers. Next came two groups of women, about
five or six in number, standing on the right and
left of the dancers, merely taking the part of super-
numeries ; they were not painted, but had leaves
in their hands, which they shook, and kept beating
time with their feet during the whole performance,
but never moved from the spot where they stood.
Next followed two remarkable characters, painted
and decorated like the dancers, but with the addition
of the palyertatta, a singular ornament, made of two
pieces of wood put cross-wise, and bound together
by the mangua in a spreading manner, having at
the extremities feathers opened, so as to set it off
to the best advantage. One had the palyertatta
stick sideways upon his head, while the other, in
a most wizard-like manner, kept waving it to and
fro before him, corresponding with the action of
his head and legs. Then followed a performer,
distinguished by a long spear, from the top of which
a bunch of feathers hung suspended, and all down
the spear the mangua was wound. He held the
koonteroo (spear and feathers) with both hands behind
his back, but occasionally altered the position, and
waved it to the right and left over the dancers.
At last came the singers?two elderly men in their
usual habiliments; their musical instruments were
the katta and wirri, on which they managed to beat
a double note; their song was one unvaried gabbling
tone.
? The night was mild?the new moon shone with
a faint light, casting a depth of shade over the earth,
which gave a sombre appearance to the surrounding
scene, that highly conduced to enhance the effect
of the approaching play. In the distance a black
mass could be discerned under the gum trees, whence
occasionally a shout and a burst of flame arose.
These were the performers dressing for the dance,
and no one approached them while thus occupied.
? Two men, closely wrapped in their opossum-
skins, noiselessly approached one of the wurlics ,
where the Kuri was to be performed, and commenced
clearing a space for the singers ; this done, they
went back to the singers, but soon after returned,
sat down and began a peculiar harsh and monoto-
nous tune, keeping time with a katta and a wirra
by rattling them together. All the natives of the
different wurlies flocked round the singers, and sat
down in the form of a horse-shoe, two or three rows
deep. By this time the dancers had moved in a
compact body to within a short distance of the
spectators ; after standing for a few minutes in per-
fect silence, they answered the singers by a singular
deep shout simultaneously; twice this was done, and
then the man with the koonteroo stepped out, his
body leaning forward, and commenced with a regular
stamp. The two men with the palyertattas followed
stamping with great regularity, the rest joining in.
The regular and alternate stamp, the waving of the
palyertatta to and fro, with the loud swishing noise
of the gum leaves, formed a scene highly charac-
teristic of the Australian natives. In this style they
approached the singers, the spectators every now and
then shouting forth their applause. For some time
they kept stamping in a body before tho singers,
which had an admirable effect, and did great credit
to their dancing attainments; then one by one they
turned round and danced their way hack to the
place they first started from, and sat down. The
palyertattas and koonteroo men were the last who
were left; and as these three singular beings
stamped their way to the other dancers, they made
a very odd appearance. Tho singing continued for
a short time, and then pipes were lighted ; shouts
of applause ensued, sand boisterous conversa-
tion followed. After resting about ten minutes,
the singers commenced again ; and soon after
the dancers huddled together and responded to
the call by the peculiar shout already men-
tioned, and then performed the same part ovor


again with this variation, that the palyertatta
men brought up the rear, instead of leading
the way. Four separate times these parts of
the play were performed with the usual effect;
others followed, the concluding one as follows :
After tramping up to the singers, the man with the
koonteroo commenced a part which called forth
unbounded applause; with his head and body in-
clined on one side, his spear and feathers behind
his back, standing on the left leg ho beat time with
the right foot, twitching his body and eye, and
stamping with the greatest precision. He remained
a few minutes in this position, and then suddenly
turned round, stood on his right leg, and did the
same over with his left foot. In the meanwhile,
the two men with the mystic palyertatta kept waving
their instruments to and fro, corresponding with the
motion of their heads and legs, and the silent
trampers performed their part equally well. The
koonteroo man now suddenly stopped, and, planting
his spear in the ground, stood in a stooping position
behind it. Two dancers stepped up, went through
the same manoeuvre as the preceding party with
wondeiful regularity, and then gave a final stamp,
turned round and grasped the spear in a stooping
position, and so on with all the rest until every
dancer was brought to the spear, so forming a
circular body. The palyertatta men now performed
the same movement on each side of this body,
accompanied with the perpetual motion of head,
leg, and arm, and then went reund and round, and
finally gave the arrival stamp?thrust in their arm
and grasped the spear; at the same time all sank
on their knees and began to move away in a mass
from the singers, with a sort of grunting noise,
while their bodies heaved and tossed to and fro ;
when they had got about ten or twelve yards they
ceased, and, giving one long semi-grunt or groan
(after the manner of the red kangaroo, as they say),
dispersed. During the whole performance the sing-
ing went on in one continued strain, and, after the
last act of the performers, the rattling accompani-
ment of the singing ceased, the strain died gradually
away, and shouts and acclamations rent the air.
Burial Ceremonies.
The Australian natives differ considerably in the
ways of burying their dead. Those of New South
Wales believe in cremation and bum their corpses.
They place the body on a pile of wood three feet
high, the face towards the rising sun, his martial
weapons laid around him, then they cover the whole
with faggots and logs, and set fire to them. The
calcined bones are carefully removed, and carried
about by the tribe or buried. The mothers of some
tribes entomb their defunct children by eating them.
As an Australian lady native despises every kind
of habiliment she goes into mourning for her husband
in the following fashion:?She shaves her head with
a large mussel shell, covers her scalp with netting,
and then claps on a coating of pipe clay, which
forms a cast of the skull upwards of an inch in
thickness, weighing several pounds. The tribes of
the Coorang turn the skulls of their relatives into
drinking vessels. Others bury their old women in
wombat holes, or the hollow trunks of trees.
The burial of a warrior is also a very singular
ceremony. The corpse is placed cross-legged on a
platform with his face towards the rising sun, his
arms are extended by means of props, the head fast-
ened back, the hair plucked off, and after collecting
every bit of kidney fat, and mixing it with red
ochre, they proceed to rub him over in a most
vigorous style. Fires are then kindled under the
platform, and the friends and relatives gather round
it, and remain for ten days, wailing and gnashing
their teeth. Two of them are more usually employed
?they keep waving boughs over the body to drive
away the flies and other insects. After the lapse of
several weeks on the platform the body is taken
down and burned, all but the skull, which as a last
friendly act, they use as a drinking vessel.
Religion.
With regard to the religion of the native it is
really impossible to say what his faith is. He ac-
knowledges the immateriality of the soul, for his
great ambition after death is ?to jump up a white
boy.? He firmly believes in a devil, but has a very
hazy idea of a God. Mr. Charles Eden, in his book
called the ?Fifth Continent,? speaking on the
religion of the Blacks, says: * ? Their mental capacity
does not admit of their grasping the higher truths of
pure religion. The devil is all very well, they find
no difficulty whatever in realising his existence, and
will willingly see one in every bush. He can punish
them for wrong-doing, can lure their best warriors
to destruction, can send painful droughts nr equally
destructive floods. This is all plain sailing, and
comes within the savages? comprehension, chiming in
as it does, with the love of the supernatural innato
with him. But when a God of love is spoken of,
who is all powerful to avert the designs of the evil
one, the native simply discredits it. I have talked
on the subject of religion over and over again, with
most intelligent blacks, and find their theory to
be this : ?lf the God of love is stronger than the
devil, why does He permit the latter to exist ? Any
attempt to explain the fall of man and the great
scheme of his redemption seems utterly hopeless.
Either the savage is unable to grasp the truth, or
his nature repels the idea of the possibility of a
good and bad spirit co-existing. Of course, I am
speaking only of adults, who have been brought
up without religious instruction as children.
Education.
If taken away from their tribe at an early age,
and placed in the schools set apart for natives in
several parts of the colonies, very excellent results
have followed, and the children have shown some
aptitude for learning, picking up English, and the
art of reading and writing without difficulty. But
the savage nature is rarely completely subdued, or
the tendency to roam eradicated. Without a day?s
warning, the black fellow, whom you have hitherto
regarded as perfectly civilised, will cast aside his
garments and take to the forest. Judge Thierry
mentions the case of a native named Benelong, who,
after a course of education in England, returned
to New South Wales, and was even admitted as a
guest at the Governor?s table. It would have been
thought that this man was broken of his wandering
habits. But no; the old love of roaming returned
in full force, the savage instinct was only dormant,
not dead. One fine morning his clothes were found,
and when next Benelong was seen, his limbs were
unfettered by ought more decorous than a scanty
opossum-skin rug.
I knew a black boy, who had been educated in
Scotland, and who spent his time at the door of
his hut reading green-backed novels. As a tracker
he was perfectly useless, and the superintendent
of the cattle-station on which he was employed was
heartily glad when he took himself off to his native
wilds. Now this man know the advantages, a com-
fortable hut, unlimited food, and abundant clothing.


possessed over a wandering life in the bush, where a
bare existence was not sustained without real hard
work, yet the savage was too strong within him,
and he relinquished beef steaks and raiment for
grubs and nudity.
One more instance. Some years ago the wife of
one of the colonial governors took a girl from the
mission school, with the intention of civilising and
christianising her. For a long time the girl behaved
remarkably well, acted as lady?s maid to her mistress
almost as satisfactorily as an European servant,
attended church regularly, joining in the service
with the congregation, and, in fact, was pointed
out as a living proof that the natives were capable
of the highest degree of civilisation. One morning,
however, black Sarah was nowhere to be found;
search was made for her, but in vain; and it was
feared that the poor girl had met with foul play
from a tribe of wild blacks who had encamped near
the town. Some weeks after this, her mistress,
whilst visiting a different part of the colony, hap-
pened to observe, amongst the occupants of a native
encampment, her long lost maid, covered with grease
and ochre, and clad in a kangaroo skin, sitting
contentedly beside a wild-looking young savage,
to become whose wife she had absconded from
Government House. Perhaps, in this instance,
there was some excuse for the dusky beauty.
Eegarding the origin of the Australian race,
ethnologists differ, some holding the opinion that
they came from the Asiatic Islands, and, crossing
Torres Straits, gradually spread themselves over the
continent; others thinking that they constitute a
race of themselves peculiar to that quarter of the
globe. They are found only in the Australian
Islands, in New Guinea, the New Hebrides, New
Caledonia, and the Solomon Islands.??
Animals.
One of the most singular features of Australian
natural history is the absence of all beasts of prey,
such as the lion, tiger, leopards, bears, or the larger
quadrupeds, such as elephants, giraffes, antelopes,
&g. Those animals peculiar to the country are the
kangarco, opossum, wombat, or Australian badger,
also several species of bandicoot, small ratlike ani-
mals, the Tasmanian wolf, about the size of a jackal,
and the Tasmanian devil. Amongst several others
the native cat, and the native dog, commonly spoken
of as the Dingo.
The Dingo, perhaps, is one of the most trouble-
some animals that the Australians have to deal
with. A sheep once touched by a dingo, be the
wound ever so insignificant, never rallies. In the
north it is necessary to fold the flocks at night
in dog-proof yards, and even then they are not
altogether safe.
? The origin of the dingo has exercised the inge-
nuity and excited the curiosity of many naturalists.
The animal is not marsupial, and is capable of
domestication in a certain degree. Mr. Gould is
of opinion that it followed the black man in his
wanderings from Asia, through the Indian islands
to Australia. Numbers of them hang about the
camps of the natives, who, I fancy, use them for
food in time of scarcity. They are never bold
enough to attack a live man, but will make short
work of a dead one, or of any carcase they can
find. 'The long lugubrious howling of these brutes
is particularly disagreeable to the tired traveller
camping in the bush.?
The Australian Seas
Are full of whales, sharks, valuable for their oil,
seals, dugong, turtle, oysters, both edible and pearl,
and fish of all kinds. The reptiles are plentiful,
from huge alligators to little lizards. Snakes abound
both in water and on land. The carpet snake (a
species of boa) is sometimes found over twenty feet
long.
Birds.
The birds of Australia are without parallel for
beauty of plumage, and their great variety. Pigeons,
parrots, eagles, hawks, kites, owls, goat-suckers,
swallows, honey-birds, kingfishers, magpies, crows,
and emus, besides wild water-fowl, including black
swans, geese, ducks, teal, widgeon, &c.
Those birds of special peculiarity are the Aus-
tralian jungle-fowl, the seipoa or native pheasant,
the British Turkey, the bower-bird, and the cas-
sowary.
Tbe Vegetation
of Australia is remarkable. Towards the north
dense jungles and forests are quite tropical in their
appearance. While the plains are destitute of vege-
tation, the hills are clothed with magnificent timber.
It is stated that there are 8,000 species of plants
in Australia unknown elsewhere. The following
is a description of the Eastern Cordilleras. Mr.
Argus thus describes them:??On entering Illawara
it seemed as though we had become suddenly trans-
ported into a region of tropical verdure, and the
scene all around us was totally new in aspect and
character. We had passed into another climate;
the dry arid soil of the stringy-bark forest, with
its stunted vegetation, was exchanged as if by
magic, for a damp humid region, sheltered from
the wind by colossal barriers of rock, and presenting
a wealth of foliage almost inconceivable. Plants
and trees were here altogether of a different species
from any we had before witnessed; the graceful
cabbage-palm towered to a height of seventy and
even a hundred feet; the Indian fig reared its
tortuous branches high into the air, clothed with
rich draperies of curious and spreading para-
sites ; and the graceful tree-ferns, thirty feet high,
flourished in the warm and damp atmosphere of
these windless dells. In short, nothing can exceed
the beauty of the scenery as the traveller descends
the difficult and winding path that leads down the
mountain to the rich pasture below, and here and
there a group of palms shoot upward towards the
sky; and on either side the forest is so rank with
creepers, ferns, and vines as to be quite unpassable.
Here we gathered wild raspberries, and beheld the
gigantic stag-horn fern growing from the trunks
of the loftiest trees.
Perhaps the gum tree, which grows in every
variety, is the most serviceable. The iron bark,
the blue gum, the box, the rose or violet wood,
the stringy bark, silk, oak, and tulip wood are all
used for various purposes. The ferns grow to great
perfection, some of them attaining a height of
twenty feet.
Several of our fruits grow well in Australia, also
many of our trees.
We trust the foregoing outline of Australia will
give our readers an idea of the principal features
of the country. It is now our intention to take
each colony separate, and describe it in detail,
giving also an account of the pursuits, trades, and
rates of wages, which, we trust, may prove useful
to those who intend making the continent of the
Southern seas their future home.
