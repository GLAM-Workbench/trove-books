THIS EVENING,
Will be produced at this Theatre, and for the first time in Sydney, a
Powerful and Emotional Drama of intense human interest, entitled, The
TWO LITTLE VAGABONDS,
By G. B. Sims & Arthur Shirley.
Founded upon “ Les Deux Gosses,” by Pierre Decourcelle ; acted by an
Exceptionally Powerful Company Specially Selected
for this Production.
MEMO.—From its very first night at the Princess’s Theatre,
London in September, last year, the “ TWO
LITTLE VAGABONDS ” were taken straight to
the heart of the Public.
The Record of this Powerful Play also includes a run of two years at the
Amhigu Theatre, Paris, and was an immensely successful production at
the Academy of Music, New York ; at the Princess Theatre, Melbourne ;
and also at other large cities throughout the world.
TO-NIGHT at 8, the Enormously Successful Sympathetic Play, THE
“GIVE US YOUR PAW,”
and congratulate us on the splendid success of
HUNTER’S PAW-PAW Sauce, which has
tickled the palate and received the grave, but
favorable, criticism of the epicures. Indeed,
PAW-PAW is the most delicjous fruit sauce
that has hitherto been made, and it possesses a
wonderfully beneficial effect on dyspepsia. All
those who suffer from indigestion should use it.
“ That comic seems to be ‘ a bit on.’ ”
“ His songs are certainly ‘ a bit off,’
anyway.”

“ I trust yonr husband had something

replied the widow, with a fresh burst of
tears. “He had seven umbrellas. John
was the thriftiest man I ever knew.”
There are ducts leading from the
corners of the eyes to the nasal cavities,
by which the tears are carried away.

WHAT A SYDNEY LADY THINKS OF IT.

m
Of all the ills that flesh is heir to
perhaps the commonest, and at the
same time, the most trying, is indi-
gestion. It is impossible to over-
estimate the terrible results that may
follow in its wake. Mrs. Maud
Hughes, of 414 Victoria Street,
Darlinghurst, Sydney, had it in a
severe way, and very kindly placed
the following details in the possession
of our reporter:
“ It is now about two years since
the indigestion first attacked me. It
commenced with gnawing pains, and
every time I breathed it hurt me.
My appetite left me, and the very
sight of food made me feel sick, and
very often at night I could not sleep ;
when I did, my rest was disturbed
by frightful dreams. Although I
had the very best medical advice in
New South Wales and other colonies
my condition did not improve, but on the contrary got worse. I suffered from
terrible headaches and a sort of mist seemed to hang over my eyes. Knowing
how ill I was, for I had by this time lost a great deal of flesh, a lady who called
to see me one day said, ‘ I have made a great discovery, which I am going to
tell you all about. It is the great virtue of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills, and
they have done me all the good in the world. My friend spoke in such glowing
terms of the great benefit they had been to her, and having also seen a number
of advertisements of this medicine, proclaiming it a positive cure for dyspepsia
and indigestion, I determined to give it a trial, and bought three boxes to
start with, and commenced taking the contents, following the directions that
were wrapped round each box. I felt better from the first. Before com-
mencing them I had been brought down so low with suffering that my medical
adviser had ordered me a change of air, and strongly recommended a sea
voyage. This advice I followed, and in a few days left for Europe, taking a
supply of the pills with me. By continuing with them my health and appetite
improved wonderfully, and I am sure the Messageries Maritimes Co. didn’t
make much out of me, for I never missed a meal whilst at sea, ‘ falling in ’
to breakfast, tiffin, and dinner most religiously. Instead of a fasting lady I
think I may justly lay claim to the title of a feasting lady. I decided to get
a fresh supply of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills at Paris ; I experienced no difficulty
in obtaining them there. After spending a short time in England I returned
home to Australia, and lam sure I feel a good ten years younger. My spirits
have revived, my complexion has improved, and I take a fresh interest in life.
I attribute all these good results to the use of Dr, Williams’ Pink Pills for
Pale'People, as before taking them I felt invariably listless and drowsy. lam
quite convinced it is this medicine that has cured me ; in fact, I have taken no
other. Yes, you are quite at liberty to publish this statement if you choose,
and if I can give you any more information, will gladly do so.”
As a spring medicine Dr, Williams’ Pink Pills far surpass all other remedies.
Their action on the blood and nerves is prompt, and the effect is wonderful.
Lassitude gives way to a feeling of renewed energy, and the lurking seeds of
disease, resulting from the indoor confinement of the winter months, are
speedily expelled from the system. These Pills are sold only in boxes, the
wrapper round which bears the full trade mark, “ Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for
Pale People.” A pill, even if coloured pink, offered in any other form, is a
fraudulent imitation, and should be promptly refused. Buyers will protect
themselves against imposition by bearing this in mind.

Du Maurier was a thorough worshipper
of beauty, as one can see from “ Trilby,”
The splendid specimens of womanhood
he used to sketch in Punch also show
this. He was no admirer of delicacy, but
loved to see well-developed frames. His
chief models were his wife and daughters.
Domestic Incident.— “ Wow ! ” It was
Mr. Newpop. He had taken a mouthful
of water melon. “ Mar" what the d-deuce
is the matter with this melon F ” “ Doesn’t
it taste good, George?” “Ho; tastes
like a hot wind. What’s the matter with
it ? ” “ Well, you know, George, the doc-
tor said to—and—and—” “ You boiled
it ! Oh ! ” Mr. Newpop settled down in
his chair and cross-eyed at the ceiling for
a few minutes ; then arose and walked un-
steadily into the open air.
Old Bullion—“ What! You wish to
marry my daughter ? She is a mere

Teacher—“ Where do the Arabs live ?”
Boy —“In the desert.” Teacher —“What
do they call those pious men who flee to

Willy—“ Why do they call them Birds

cause their feathers make such heavenly
bonnets. ,

Mirages.
There are few phenomena in nature so
striking as mirages, whether they take
the form* of the palm groves seen across
a desert, as, for instance, in going through
the Suez Canal, or of portents in the sky
like that wonderful storm-blow figuring
in the three crosses of Calvary, which
forms the frontispiece of Mr. Whymper’s
“ Scrambles in the Alps.” A species of
mirage commonly seen across lakes in
fine weather is the Fata Morgana , whereby
diminutive cottages are magnified into
gorgeous fairy palaces, rocks become pin-
nacles, and so on. M. Delebecque has
recently been making an examination into
the causes of this phenomenon, and has
communicated his researches to the
Academie des Sciences. He finds that if
the magnified object be scrutinised
through a telescope it resolves itself into
a number of separate superposed images
which cannot be distinguished by the eye.
Moreover, it may happen that * only one
portion of the object is magnified at a
time ; thus he has seen a boat with double
hull and normal sails suddenly transform
itself into a single hull with gigantic
spread of canvas. As many as five
images may be reflected at the same time.
The mirage also occasionally takes the
reverse form, of diminishing objects
looked at. It occurs most frequently
when the temperature of the air is higher
than that of the lake.

Important Reminder
Physiologists in modern times con-
demn the ordinary bran of wheat
as irritating and likely to inflame
the delicate intestines, and in this
fact lies the great value of
GBAIIUMA,
because its special manufacture is
devoted to rendering the bran por-
tion smooth, soluble and digestible,
retaining the natural phosphates
always attached to the outer shell
of wheat. Phosphates supply
vitality, teeth and brain.

Wales five times exceeds that of any other
brand, and it is daily increasing in popularity.
It enjoys the same popular call in the other col-
onies, other competing brands being nowhere.

doctors for kidney and allied maladies. Taken
with a dash of Angostura, or with Soda or Ginger
Beer, it is a most refreshing and wholesome
stimulant.

A’cyclist was in a Scotch village inn
bragging about his abilities as a rider to
such an extent that the publican ventured
to make a bet with him. “ I say, mister,”
said the man, “ I’ll bet you half-a-crown
that you can’t ride up and down this road
till the church clock strikes four.”
“ Done,” shouted the cyclist, and the next
moment he was speeding? up and down
the road. After about three-quarters of
an hour’s hard riding up and down, the
cyclist asked one of the bystanders if the
church clock had yet struck four.
“Struck four? No fear,” was the blunt
reply ; “ our church clock never strikes,”
Why is the Negro Black ?
The pigmentation of the negro is a
question that has long vexed ethnologists.
One of the most curious theories yet
ventilated to account for it, however, is put
forward by Mr. A. H. Keanein “ Ethno-
logy ” (Cambridge Geographical Series),
that “it seems due to the stimulating
action of solar heat, combined with mois-
ture and an excess of vegetable food, yield-
ing more carbon than can be assimilated,
the character being then fixedby heredity.’’
The “ gentleman farmer,” so called, has
to put up with many jokes at his expense
in print. In real life he is not often
treated to speeches as amusing as one
which recently came to our ears. Before
leaving his place for a winter visit to gayer
scenes, the “ farmer ” of the anecdote
called his Hibernian head man and said—
“ Flynn, I have to be away for a fortnight.
I hope everything will run smoothly on
the farm.” “ Oh,” said Flynn, heartily,
“ye don’t do a bit o’ harm, sir, when
you’re here ! ”

“ I believe I saw yon coming out of a

Mr, Wilgus. “ I guess you did,” said the
parishioner. “On business, I hope ? ”
“ No. I will be candid with you, I went
in to get a drink. You see it was this
way. I had a counterfeit coin passed on
me.” “ Yes.” “And there are only two
pieces a man can get rid of a counterfeit
coin—a church and a public-house. And
of course I didn’t want to pass it on the
contribution box.” The Rev. Mr. W.—

The Sinai Copper Mines
M. Berthelot, in a communication to
the Aoaddmie des Sciences, describes the
results of an analysis of some ores from
the famous copper mines of Sinai. These
mines were worked by the early Egyp-
tians, and were a frequent cause of wars
at a time when copper was the only sub-
stitute for wood and stones. M. Ber-
thelot finds the ore to be remarkably poor
and difficult to work, probably the reason
why the mines were abandoned two thou-
sand years ago ; but an interesting point
which has been brought to light is that
the ancients practised precisely the same
method of extraction as we do at the
present day —namely, reduction with
charcoal combined with silicious and cal-
careous fluxes.

“Entire,” as applied to beer, signifie
that it is drawn entirely from one butt. For-
merly the favourite beer was a mixture of
ale or beer and twopenny, until a brewer
named Hai wood produced a beer with the
same flavour, which he called “ entire,” or
“ entire butt.”

Electric Lighting in Bolton.
The demand for electricity in Bolton
has grown rapidly since its introduction
by the Corporation; and the recent
adoption of what is known as the Brighton
scale of charges promises to giye such a
stimulus to the public demand that it has
been decided to spend an additional
£30,000 on the extension of the works
and plant. The revised scale places the
electric light within the means of the in-
dustrial classes, and before long it is
expected that many working men’s homes
in the town will be lighted by electricity
in place of gas.
