f GOLDEN day so long desired,
Born of a darksome night,
The swinging globe at last is fired,
By thy resplendent light.
And hark ! like Memnon’s morning chord
Is 1 heard from sea to sea
This song : One Master, Christ, the Lord ;
And brethren'all 'are we.
The noises of the night shall cease,
The storms no longer roar ;
The factious foes of God’s own peace
Shall vex His church no more.
A thousand thousand voices sing
The surging harmony ;
One Master, Christ ; one ■ Saviour, King ;
s
g
And brethren all are we.
Sing on, ye chorus of the morn,
Your grand Endeavour strain,
Till Christian hearts, estranged and torn,
Blend in the glad refrain ;
And all the church, with all its powers,
In loving loyalty,
Shall sing : One Master, Christ, is ours
And brethren all are we.
O golden day, the age’s crown,
Alight with heavenly love,
Rare day in prophecy renoun,
On to thy zenith move.
When all the world with one accord,
In full-voiced unity,
Shall sing : One Master, Christ, our Lord ;
And brethren all are we.

I.—Sowing in the Morning.
Sankey’s, 274.
SOWING in the morning, sowing seeds
of kindness,
Sowing in the noontide and the dewy
eves :
Waiting for the harvest, and the time of
reaping,
We shall come rejoicing, bringing in
the sheaves.
Bringing in the sheaves !
Bringing in the sheaves !
We shall come rejoicing,
Bringing in the sheaves.
Sowing in the sunshine, sowing in the
shadows,
Fearing neither clouds, nor winter’s
chilling breeze ;
By-and-by the harvest, and the labour
ended,
We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the
sheaves.
Bringing in the sheaves, &c.
Go then ever, weeping, sowing for the
Master,
Though the loss sustained our Spirit
often grieves ;
When our weeping’s over, He will bid us
welcome,
We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the
sheaves.
Bringing in the sheaves, &c.
2.—Christian Endeavour.
Endeavour Hymns.
COME rally, Endeavourers, for God and
the right,
Come rally around us and join in the
fight—
The fight against sin, against evil and
wrong;
Oh, manfully battle; be brave and be
strong I
For the conquering Saviour will
break every chain,
And give us the victory again and
again.
Our Captain commands us; ’tis Jesus
leads on;
He’ll give us the victory, and grant us the
crown ;
He ne’er will desert us, and triumph is
For all who with courage and patience
endure.
For the conquering Saviour, &c.
Then rally, Endeavourers, for God and
the right:
Let us work with a will, let us work with
our might :
And never give o’er till we hear the glad
word—
“ Well done, enter into the joy of thy
Lord.”
For the conquering Saviour, &c.
3.—Sound the Battle Cry.
Sankey’s, 511.
SOUND the battle cry,
See I the foe is nigh;
liaise the standard high
For the Lord !
Gird your armour on,
Stand firm every one,
Best your cause upon
His Holy Word.
Bouse then, soldiers ! rally round the
banner!
Beady, steady, pass the word along ;
Onward, forward, shout aloud Hosanna,
Christ is captain of the mighty throng.
Strong to meet the foe,
Marching on we go,
While our cause we know
Must prevail;
Shield and banner bright
Gleaming in the light,
Battling for the right,
We ne’er can fail.
Rouse then, soldiers, &c.


O Thou God of all,
Hear us when we call;
Help us one and all,
By thy grace !
When the battle’s done,
And the vict’ry won,
May we wear the crown
Before Thy face.
House then, soldiers, &c.
4.—On the Lord’s Side.
Loyal Responses , 8
WHO is on the Lord’s side ?
Who will serve the King,
Who will be his helpers,
Other lives to bring?
Who will leave the world’s side ?
Who will face the foe ?
Who is on the Lord’s side ?
Who for Him will go ?
By Thy call of mercy,
By Thy grace divine,
We are on the Lord’s side ;
Saviour, we are Thine.
Not for weight of glory,
Not for crown and palm,
Enter we the army,
Eaise the warrior-psalm ;
But for love that claimeth
Lives for whom He died :
He whom Jesus nameth
Must be on His side.
By Thy love constraining,
By Thy grace divine,
We are on the Lord’s side,
Saviour, we are Thine.
Jesus, Thou hast brought us,
Not with gold or gem,
But with Thine own life-blood,
For Thy diadem.
With Thy blessing filling,
Each who comes to Thee,
Thou hast made us willing,
Thou hast made us free.
By Thy grand redemption,
By Thy grace divine,
We are on the Lord’s side,
Saviour, we are Thine.
Chosen to be soldiers
In an alien land ;
“ Chosen, called, and faithful,”
For our Captain’s band ;
In the service royal,
Let us not grow cold ;
Let us be right royal,
Noble, true and bold.
Master, Thou wilt keep us,
By Thy grace divine,
Always on the Lord’s side,
Saviour, always Thine I
s.—Lord, Thy Church is
Waking.
Consecration and Faith, 434.
LORD, Thy ransomed Church is waking
Out of slumber far and near,
Knowing that the morn is breaking
When the Bridegroom shall appear ;
Waking up to claim the treasure
With Thy precious life-blood bought,
And to trust in fuller measure
All Thy wondrous death hath wrought.
Praise to Thee for this glad shower,
Precious drops of latter rain ;
Praise, that by Thy Spirit’s power
Thou hast quickened us again ;
That Thy Gospel’s priceless treasure
Now is borne from laud to land,
And that all the Father’s pleasure
Prospers in Thy pierced hand.
Praise to Thee for saved ones yearning
O’er the lost and wandering throng ;
Praise for voices daily learning
To upraise the glad new song :
Praise to Thee for sick ones hasting
Now to touch Thy garment’s hem ;
Praise for souls believing—tasting
All Thy love has won for them.
6.—Blest be the Tie that Binds.
Sankey’s, 80.
BLEST be the tie that binds
Our hearts in Christian love :
The fellowship of kindred minds
Is like to that above.
Before our father’s throne
We pour our ardent prayers ;
Our fears, our hopes, our aims are one,
Our comforts and our cares.


We share our mutual woes,
Our mutual burdens bear ;
And often for each other flows
The sympathising tear.
When we asunder part,
It gives us inward pain ;
But we shall still be joined in heart,
And hope to meet again.
7,-Is Your Life Fully Yielded
to Jesus?
Consecration and Faith, 190.
IS your lite fully yielded to Jesus ?
Is He King alone in your soul ?
Is the government placed on His shoulder,
Not only in part, but the whole?
Do you look for His guidance in all things ?
Do you trust Him with every care ?
Do you keep in His presence each
moment ?
And always your joy with Him share ?
Do you sit at His feet in the morning,
And wait ere you go on your way;
Seeking first for the strength and the
wisdom,
To live to His glory all day ?
Do you trust Him for victory ever ?
Over self, and Satan and Sin ?
Do you follow the sure, gentle leading
Of God’s Holy Spirit within ?
B.—Blessed Assurance.
Sankey's 500.
BLESSED assurance—Jesus is mine !
Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine !
Heir of salvation, purchase of God ;
Born of the Spirit, washed in His blood.
This is my story, this is my song,
Praising my Saviour all the day long;
This is my story, this is my song,
Praising my Saviour all the day long.
Perfect submission, perfect delight,
Visions of rapture burst on my sight;
Angels descending, bring from above,
Echoes of mercy, whispers of love.
This is my story, &c.
Perfect submission, all is at rest,
I in my Saviour am happy and blest;
Watching and waiting, looking above,
Filled with His goodness, lost in His love*
This is my story, &c.
9.—When I Survey the Won-
drous Cross.
Consecration and Faith, 62
WHEN I survey the wondrous cross
On which the Prince of glory died.
My richest gain I count but loss,
And pour contempt on all my pride.
Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
Save in the cross of Christ my God :
All the vain things that charm me most,
I sacrifice them to His blood.
See from His head, His hands, His feet,
Sorrow and love flow mingled down :
Did e’er such love and sorrow meet,
Or thorns compose so rich a crown.
His dying crimson, like a robe,
Spread’s o’er His body on the tree
Then am I dead to all the globe,
And all the globe is dead to me.
Were the whole realm of nature mine,
That were a present far too small,
Love so amazing, so divine,
Demands my soul, my life, my all I
10.-My Jesus, X Love Thee.
Sankey’s, 374.
MY Jesus I love Thee, I know Thou art
ill mine !
For Thee all the pleasures of sin I resign ;
My gracious Redeemer, my Saviour art
Thou !
If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, ’tis now I
I love Thee because Thou hast first loved
me,
And purchased my pardon on Calvary’s
tree ;
I love Thee for wearing the thorns on
Thy brow;
If ever 1 love Thee, my Jesus, ’tis now!


1 will love Thee in life, I will love Thee in
death,
And praise Thee as long as Thou lendest
me breath ;
And say when the death-dew lies cold on
my brow—
If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, ’tis now !
In mansions of glory and endless delight,
I’ll ever adore Thee in Heaven so bright;
I’ll sing with the glittering crown on my
brow—
If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, ’tis now !
11.—Let us Sing of His Love.
Consecration and Faith, 832.
LET us sing of His love once again ;
Of the love that can never decay,
Of the blood of the Lamb who was slain,
Till we praise Him again in that day.
I believe, Jesus saves,
And His blood washes whiter than
snow;
Tell the world Jesus saves,
And His blood washes whiter than
snow.
There are cleansing and healing for all
Who will wash in the life-giving flood ;
There is life everlasting, and joy
At the right-hand of God, through the
blood.
I believe, &c.
Even now while we taste of His love,
We are filled with delight at His name ;
But what will it be when above,
We shall join in the song of the Lamb !
I believe, &c.
Then we’ll march in His name till we
come,
At His bidding, to enter our rest ;
And the Father shall welcome us home
To our place in the realms of the blest.
I believe, &c.
So with banner unfurled to the breeze,
Our motto shall “ Holiness ” be ;
Till the crown from His hand we shall
seize,
And the King in His glory we see.
I believe, &c.
12.—Let me come Closer to
Thee.
Heart and Lije, 79.
LET me come closer to Thee, Jesus ;
Oh! closer day by day,
Let me lean harder on Thee, Jesus,
Yes, harder all the way.
Let me show forth Thy beauty, Jesus,
Like sunshine on the hills.
Oh ! let my lips pour forth Thy sweetness
In joyous sparkling rills.
Yes, like a fountain, precious Jesus,
Make me and let me be;
Keep me and use me daily, Jesus,
For Thee, for only Thee.
In all my heart and will, 0 Jesus,
Be altogether King,
Make me a loyal subject, Jesus,
To Thee in everything.
13.—Take My Life.
Sankey's, 416.
TAKE my life and let it be
JL Consecrated, Lord, to Thee ;
Take my moments and my days,
Let them flow in ceaseless praise.
Take my hands, and let them move
At the impulse of Thy love ;
Take my feet, and let them be
Swift and beautiful for Thee.
Take my voice, and let me sing
Always, only, for my King ;
Take my lips', and let them be,
Filled with messages from Thee.
Take my silver and my gold ;
Not a mite would I withhold ;
Take my intellect, and use
Every power as Thou shalt choose.
Take my will, and make it Thine ;
It shall be no longer mine ;
Take my heart ; it is Thine own,
It shall be Thy royal Throne.
Take my love ; my Lord, I pour
At Thy feet its treasure store ;
Take myself ; and I will be
Ever only, ALL for Thee.


14 I’m on my Journey.
Sankey's, 269.
I’M on my journey up Zion’s hill,
All the way ’long it is Jesus ;
The way grows brighter and brighter still,
All the way ’long it is Jesus.
Jesus ! Jesus !
Why, all the way ’long it is Jesus !
And oh, how happy the pilgrim’s lot,
All the way ’long it is Jesus ;
He has a comfort the world has not,
All the way ’long it is Jesus.
Jesus, &c.
Let storm-clouds gather and troubles rise,
All the way ’long it is Jesus ;
He seeks a city with cloudless skies,
All the way ’long it is Jesus.
Jesus, &c.
At home the pilgrims together will sing,
All the way ’long it is Jesus ;
We’ll make the heavenly mansions ring,
All the way ’long it is Jesus.
Jesus, &c.
15.-Oh, Dear Redeemer.
Gospel Temperance Hymns.
ODEAR Redeemer, dying Lamb,
O ray Lord!
No music like Thy charming name,
O ray Lord !
He’s the lily of the valley,
O my Lord !
He’s the lily of the valley,
, omy Lord !
He saw me ruined by the Fall,
0 my Lord !
And loves me notwithstanding all,
0 my Lord!
He’s the lily, &c.
To cleanse my sins He shed His blood,
O my Lord !
And died to bring me back to God,
O my Lord !
He’s the lily, &c.
He conquers all my mighty foes,
O ray Lord!
And saves when earth and hell oppose,
O my Lord !
He’s the lily, &c.
Come, all ye needy, He'll relieve ;
O my Lord !
Come all ye guilty, He’ll forgive,
U my Lord !
He’s the lily, &c.
I’ll praise Him whilst He lends me
breath,
O my Lord !
And then I’ll praise Him after death,
0 my Lord !
He’s the lily, &c.
16.—Peace, Perfect Peace.
San key's, 730.
PEACE ! perfect peace ! in this dark
world of sin ?
The blood of Jesus whispers peace within.
Peace ! perfect peace ! by thronging duties
prest ?
To do the will of Jesus, this is rest.
Peace ! perfect peace ! with sorrows surg-
ing round ?
On Jesus’ bosom nought but calm is found.
Peace ! perfect peace ! with loved ones far
away ?
In Jesus’ keeping we are safe, and they.
Peace! perfect peace ! our future all
unknown ?
Jesus we know, and He is on the throne.
Peace! perfect peace! death shadowing
us and ours ?
Jesus has vanquished death and all its
powers.
It is enough: earth’s struggles soon shall
cease,
And Jesus calls us to heaven’s perfect
peace.
17.—Welcome, Welcome, Dear
Redeemer.
Consecration and Faith, 90.
WELCOME, welcome, 0 Redeemer,
Welcome to this heart of mine.
Lord. I make a full surrender,
Every power and thought be thine :
Thine entirely, Thine entirely,
Through eternal ages Thine ;
Thine entirely, Thine entirely,
Through eternal ages Thine.


Oh, I love Thee, precious Jesus.
And I know that thou art mine;
All my heart I give Thee, Jesus,
And I know thou mak’st it Thine.
Take my warmest, best affections,
Take my mera’ry, mind, and will,
And with all Thy loving Spirit
All my emptied nature fill.
Vain the world, its pleasures boasting;
Vain the charms of life to me ;
Gold is dross, and riches worthless,
If they turn my heart from Thee.
Nearer, dearer than a brother
Source and centre of my bliss;
All of joy, and all of sorrow,
Find their end is knowing this.
18.—Like a River Glorious.
Consecration and Faith, 261.
LIKE a river glorious,
Is God’s perfect peace,
Over all victorious
In its bright increase;
Perfect, yet it floweth
Fuller every day,—
Perfect, yet it groweth
Deeper all the way.
Stayed upon Jehovah,
Hearts are fully blest;
Finding, as He promised,
Perfect peace and rest.
Hidden in the hollow
Of His blessed hand,
Never foe can follow,
Never traitor stand ;
Not a surge of worry,
Not a shade of care,
Not a blast of hurry,
Touch the spirit there.
Stayed upon Jehovah, &c.
Every joy or trial
Falleth from above,
Traced upon our dial
By the Sun of Love.
We may trust Him fully
All for us to do ;
They who trust Him wholly
Find Him wholly true.
Stayed upon Jehovah, &c,
19.—My God I am Thine.
Consecration and Faith, 352.
My God, I am Thine ; what a comfort
divine ! ,
What a blessing to know that the Saviour
is mine !
Hallelujah ! Thine the glory !
Hallelujah ! Amen !
Hallelujah ! Thine the Glory !
Come, Jesus, again,
In the Heavenly Lamb, thrice happy I
am ; ,
And my heart doth rejoice at the sound
of His name.
Hallelujah ! &c.
My Jesus to know, and to feel His love
flow,
’Tis life everlasting, ’Tis heaven below.
Hallelujah ! &c.
Yet onward I haste to the heavenly feast;
That, that is the fulness, but this is the
taste.
Hallelujah, &c.
And this I shall prove, till with joy I
remove
To the heaven of heavens in Jesus own
love.
Hallelujah. &c.
20- Cleansing for Me.
lORD, through the blood of the Lamb
J that was slain,
Cleansing for me,
From all the gilt of my sins n )W I claim,
Cleansing for me.
Sinful and black though the past may
have been,
Many the crushing defeats I have seen.
Yet on Thy promise, O Lord ! now I lean,
Cleansing for me.
From all the doubts that have filled me
with gloom,
Cleansing for me.
From all the fears that would point me to
doom.
Cleansing for me.


Jesus, although I may not understand,
In childlike faith I now put forth my
hand,
And through Thy word and Thy grace I
shall stand,
Cleansed by Thee.
From all the care of what men think or
say,
Cleansing for me.
From ever fearing to speak, sing or pray,
Cleansing for me.
Lord in Thy love and Thy power make
me strong,
That all may know that to Thee I belong;
When I am tempted, let this be my song—
Cleansing for me.
21.—Jesus Saves.
Sankey's, 473.
WE have heard the joyful sound;
Jesus saves ! Jesus saves !
Tell the message all around :
Jesus saves! Jesus saves !
Bear the news to ev’ry land,
Climb the steeps and cross the waves ;
Onward I—'tis our Lord’s command :
Jesus saves ! Jesus saves !
Waft it on the rolling tide :
Jesus saves ! Jesus saves !
Say to sinners far and wide ;
Jesus saves ! Jesus saves !
Sing, ye islands of the sea,
Echo back, ye ocean caves;
Earth shall keep her Jubilee :
Jesus saves ! Jesus saves !
Sing above the toil and strife, —
Jesus saves ! Jesus saves !
By His death and endless life, —
Jesus saves ! Jesus saves !
Sing it softly thro’ the gloom,
When the heart for mercy craves ;
Sing in triumph o’er the tomb, —
Jesus saves ! Jesus saves !
Give the winds a mighty voice:
Jesus saves ! Jesus saves !
Let the nations now rejoice,—
Jesus saves ! Jesus saves !
Shout salvation full and free
To every strand that ocean laves ;
This our song of victory,
Jesus saves ! Jesus saves !
22.- -Hail! Sweetest, Dearest
Tie.
Heart and TAfe, 199.
HAIL ! sweetest, dearest tie that binds
Our glowing hearts in one ;
Hail ! sacred hope that fills o ir minds
As towards the goal we run.
It is the hope, the blissful hope,
Which Jesu’s grace has given ;
The hope when days and years are past,
We all shall meet in heaven.
We all shall meet in heaven at last,
We all shall meet in heaven ;
We know when .days and years are
past,
We all shall meet in heaven.
What though the northern wintry blast
Should howl around our cot;
What though beneath an eastern sun
Were cast our distant lot;
Yet still we’d share the blissful hope,
Which Jesu’s grace has given ;
The hope when days and years are past,
We all shall meet in heaven.
We all shall meet, &c.
No lingering look, no parting sigh,
Our future meeting knows ;
There friendship beams from every eye,
And love immortal glows.
0 sacred hope ! 0 blissful hope !
Which Jesu’s grace has given ;
The hope when days and years are past,
W e all shall meet in heaven.
We all shall meet, &c.
23.—Par, Par Away.
Sankey's, 446.
FAR, far away in heathen dai’kness
dwelling,
Millions of souls for ever may be lost,
Who, who will go Salvation’s story
telling
Looking to Jesus, counting not the cost ?
“ All power is given unto me ! All
power is given unto me ! Go ye into
all the world and preach the Gospel;
and 10, I am with you always.”


See o’er the world wide open doors in-
viting:
Soldiers of Christ, arise and enter in !
Christians, awake ! your forces all unit-
ing. , , .
Send forth the Gospel, break the chains
of sin !
AH power, &c.
‘‘ Why will ye die ? ” the voice of God is
calling;
“ Why will ye die ? ” re-echo in His
Name:
Jesus hath died to save from death ap
palling;
Life and salvation therefore go pro-
claim.
All power, &c.
God speed the day when those of ev’ry
nation,
“ Glory to God ” triumphantly shall
sing;
Ransom’d, redeem’d, rejoicing in salvation,
Shout “ Hallelujah, for the Lord is
King ! ”
All power, &c.
24,—The Holy Ghost is Come.
Consecration and Faith, 186.
THE Holy Ghost is come,
We feel His presence here ;
Our hearts would now no longer roam,
But bow in filial fear.
This tenderness of love,
This hush of solemn power,
’Tis heaven descending from above,
To fill this favoured hour.
Earth’s darkness all has fled,
Heaven’s light serenely shines ;
And every heart divinely led,
To holy thought inclines.
No more let sin deceive,
Nor earthly care betray,
Oh, let us never, never grieve
The Comforter away !
25.—My Heart is Resting.
Consecration and Faith, 247.
MY heart is resting. 0 my God,
I will give thanks and sing :
My heart is at the secret source
Of every precious thing.
Now the frail vessel Thou hast made,
No hand but Thine shall fill—
The waters of the earth have failed,
And I am thirsty still.
I thirst for springs of heavenly life,
And here all day they rise—
I seek the treasure of Thy love,
And close at hand it lies.
And a “ new song” is in my mouth,
To long-loved music set—
Glory to Thee for all the grace
I have not tasted yet.
A prayer reposing on His truth.
Who hath made all things mine ;
That draws my captive will to Him,
And makes it one with Thine.
26.—Beneath the Cross of Jesus
Sankey’s, 108.
BENEATH the Cross of Jesus
I fain would take my stand—
The shadow of a mighty rock
Within a weary land
A home within the wilderness,
A rest upon the way,
From the burning of the noontide heat,
And the burden of the day.
0 safe and happy shelter !
0 refuge tried and sweet!
0 trystiug-place, where Heaven’s love
And Heaven’s justice meet!
As to the holy Patriarch
That wondrous dream was given,
So seems my Saviour’s cross to me
A ladder up to heaven.
Upon the Cross of Jesus,
Mine eye at times can see
The very dying form of One
Who suffered there for me ;
And from my smitten heart with tears,
Two wonders I confess, —
The wonders of His glorious love,
And my own worthlessness.
I take, 0 Cross, thy shadow
For my abiding place ;
I ask no other sunshine than
The sunshine of His face ;
Content to let the world go by,
. To know no gain nor loss,—
My sinful self my only shame,
My glory all the Cross.


27.—0 h Jesus, Sweetest,
Dearest Name.
Heart and Life, 61.
0 JESUS, Jesus ! dearest Lord !
Forgive me if I say
For very love Thy sacred Name
A thousand times a day.
Oh wonderful! that Thou shouldst let
So vile a heart as mine
Love Thee with such a love as this,
And make so free with Thine.
Burn, burn, 0 Love ! within my heart,
Bum fiercely night and day,
Till all the dross of earthly loves
Is burned and burned away.
0 Light in darkness, Joy in grief,
0 Heaven begun on earth !
Jesus ! my Love ! my Treasui’e ! who
Can tell what Thou art worth ?
0 Jesus ? Jesus ! sweetest Lord !
What art Thou not to me ?
Each hour brings joy before unknown,
Each day new liberty !
28.—More than Conqueror.
Consecration and Faith, 200.
I’M more than conqueror through His
blood.
Jesus saves me now ;
I rest beneath the shield of God,
Jesus saves me now.
I go a kingdom to obtain,
I shall through Him the victory gain,
Jesus saves me now.
Before the battle lines are spread,
Jesus saves me now ;
Before the boasting foe is dead,
Jesus saves me now.
I win the fight though not begun,
I’ll trust and shout, still marching on,
Jesus saves me now.
I’ll ask no more that I may see,
Jesus saves me now ;
His promise is enough for me,
Jesus saves me now.
Though foes be strong and walls be high,
I’ll shout, He gives the victory,
Jesus saves me now.
Should Satan come like ’whelming waves,
Jesus saves me now ;
Ere trials crush, my father saves,
Jesus saves me now.
He hides me till the storm is past,
For me he tempers every blast,
Jesus saves me now.
29.—Out of My Bondage.
Sankey's, 487.
OUT of my bondage, sorrow, and night,
Jesus, I come ! Jesus, I come !
Into Thy freedom, gladness, and light,
Jesus I come to Thee !
Out of my sickness into Thy health,
Out of my want and into Thy wealth,
Out of my sin and into Thyself,
Jesus I come to Thee!
Out of my shameful failure and loss,
Jesus, I come ! Jesus, I come !
Into the glorious gain of Thy cross,
Jesus, I come to Thee !
Out of earth’s sorrows into thy balm,
Out of life’s storms and into Thy calm,
Out of distress to jubilant psalm,
Jesus, I come to Thee !
Out of unrest and arrogant pride,
Jesus, I come ! Jesus, I come !
Into Thy blessed will to abide,
Jesus, I come to Thee !
Out of myself to dwell in Thy love,
Out of despair into raptures above,
Upward for aye on wings like a dove,
Jesus, I come to Thee !
Out of the fear and dread of the tomb,
Jesus, I come ! Jesus, I come !
Into the joy and light of Thy home,
Jesus I come to Thee !
Out of the depths of ruin untold,
Into the peace of Thy sheltering fold,
Ever Thy glorious face to behold,
Jesus, I come to Thee !
30 —God be with You.
GOD be with you till we meet again !
By His counsels guide, uphold you,
With His sheep securely fold you;
God be with you till we meet again !


Till we meet! .. . Till we meet .. .
Till we meet at Jesus’ feet; . . .
Till we meet! .. . Till we meet! . .
God be with you till we meet again !
God be with you till we meet again !

Yielding henceforth to our glorious
King;
Valiant endeavour and loving obedience,
Freely and joyously now would we bring.

Till Jesus eased my troubled mind,
Shelter in the time of storm.
Oh, Jesus is a rock in a weary land,
In a weary land, in a weary land,
Oh, Jesus is a rock in a weary land,
A shelter in the time of storm.
When none was strong enough to save,
Shelter in the time of storm ;
His life for me He freely gave,
Shelter in the time of storm.
Oh, Jesus is a rock, &c.
Tho’ storms may come and tempest roar,
Shelter in the time of storm ;
I’m safe in Jesus evermore,
Shelter in the time of storm.

Shelter in the time of storm,
My bliss in heaven shall ever last,
Shelter in the time of storm.
Oh, Jesus is a rock, &c.
35.—Victory for Me.
mo the front ! the cry is ringing,
I. To the front! your place is there;
In the conflict men are wanted,
Men of hope and faith and prayer.


Selfish ends shall claim no right
From the battle’s front to take us ;
Fear shall vanish in the fight,
For triumphant God will make us.
No retreating, hell defeating,
Shoulder to shoulder we stand ;
God look down, with victory crown
Our Endeavour Band.
Victory for me !
Through the blood of Christ, my
Saviour;
Victory for me!
Through the precious blood.
To the front ! the fight is raging,
Christ's own banner leads the way ;
Every power and thought engaging,
Might divine shall be our stay.
We have heard the cry for help
From the dying millions round us ;
We've received the Eoyal command
From our dying Lord who found us.
No retreating, hell defeating, &c.
To the front ! no more delaying,
Wounded spirits need thy care ;
To the front ! thy Lord obeying,
Stoop to help the dying there.
Broken hearts and blighted hope,
Slaves of sin and degredation,
Wait for thee in love to bring
Holy peace and liberation.
No retreating, hell defeating, &c.
36.—1 am a Soldier.
ROUSED from my slumber, called forth
to war,
I follow now my Saviour ;
I tread the path that He trod before,
Winning for me God’s favour.
Danger and hardship, sorrow and shame
I’ll bear with joy for my Saviour’s
name;
Though fierce the conflict, yet this I
know,
I shall the victory gain.
I am a soldier, glory to God I
Fighting for Christ who bought
me;
I am a soldier, washed in the
Blood,
Marching along to glory.
I will be daring, fighting for God,
True to the charge Pie gives me;
Gladly I’ll stand where Jesus has stood,
Though it my life may cost me.
Now sin’s enticements I’ll treat with
scorn,
My heart from Jesus no power shall
turn ;
For Him who suffered death me to save,
My soul with love shall burn.
1 am a soldier, &c.
Glory to Jesus ! praise to His name,
For He of praise is worthy ;
He frees the captive, breaks every chain,
Pard’ning the rebel freely.
Glad are the tidings I have to bear,
Sinners around me of Christ shall hear,
As I proclaim the grace of my Lord,
To whom each soul is dear.
I am a soldier, &c.
37 -Shining as the Stars.
MUCH of what this world can boast,
I have lived to count as dross;
And the sight that charms me most,
Is a sinner at the cross.
They that turn many to righteous-
ness,
Shall shine forth as the stars for
Shining as the stars for ever.
Shining as the stars for ever.
Away to be with Jesus,
Shining as the stars.
Sounds of rapture, earthly glee,
Thunder’s roll and ocean’s wave,
These I’ve heard—but give to me
Sinners asking Christ to save.
They that turn many, &e.
Charms and joys once felt and known,
Backward through my life I trace :
But this joy stands out alone—
Sinners found and saved by grace.
They that turn many, &e.


38.—Throw Out the Lite-Line !
THROW out the Life-Line across the
4 dark wave,
There is a brother whom someone should
save;
Somebody’s brother! oh, who then will
dare [share.
To throw out the Life-Line, his peril to
Throw out the Life-Line! Throw out
the Life-Line!
Some one is drifting away !
Throw out the Life-Line I Throw out
the Life-Line!
Some one is sinking to-day !
Throw out the Life-Line with hand quick
and strong;
Why do you tarry, my brother, so long ?
See—he is sinking ; oh, hasten to-day—
And out with the Life boat! away, then
away!
Throw out the Life-Line, &c.
Throw out the Life-Line to danger-fraught
men,
Sinking in anguish where you’ve never
been ;
Winds of temptation and billows of woe
Will soon hurl them out where the dark
waters flow.
Throw out the Life-Line, &c.
Soon will the season of rescue be o’er,
Soon will they drift to eternity’s shore,
Haste then, my brother! no time for
delay,
Rut throw out the Life-Line, aud save
them to-day I
Throw out the Life-Line, &c.
39.—Then shall my Heart keep
Singing.
JDO not ask for earthly store
Beyond a day’s supply ;
I only covet, more and more,
The clear and single eye,
To see my duty face to face,
And trust the Lord for daily grace.
Then shall my heart keep singing,
While to the cross I cling;
For rest is sweet at Jesus’ feet, [ing.
While homeward faith keeps wing-
While homeward faith keeps winging.
I care not for the empty show
The thoughtless worldlings see;
I crave to do the best I know,
And leave the rest with Thee:—
Well satisfied that sweet reward
Is sure to those who trust the Lord.
Then shall my heart, &c.
Whate’er the crosses mine shall be,
I will not dare to shun ;
I only ask to live for Thee,
And that Thy will be done ;
Thy will, 0 Lord, be mine, each day,
While pressing on my homeward way.
Then shall my heart, &c.
And when at last, my labour o’er,
I cross the narrow sea,
Grant, Lord, that on the other shore
My soul may dwell with Thee;
Aud learn what here I cannot know,
Why Thou hast ever loved me so.
Then shall my heart, &c.
40.—What a Wonderful
Saviour.
CHRIST has for sin atonement made ;
What a wonderful Saviour!
We are redeemed!—the price is paid :
What a wonderful Saviour !
What a wonderful Saviour is Jesus,
my Jesus !
What a wonderful Saviour is Jesus,
my Lord!
I praise Him for the cleansing blood :
What a wonderful Saviour !
That reconciled my soul to God:
What a wonderful Saviour !

What 'a wonderful Saviour !
And now he reigns and rules therein :
What a wonderful Saviour !
What a wonderful, &c.
He gives me overcoming power ;
What a wonderful Saviour !
Aud triumph in each trying hour:
What a wonderful Saviour !
What a wonderful, &c.


To Him I’ve given all my heart:
What a wonderful Saviour !
The world shall never share a part:

CHORUSES.
41 Grace there is ray every debt to pay,
Blood to wash my every sin away,
Power to keep me spotless day by day,
Por me, for me.
42 Grace in stormy hours to shelter me,
Grace abundant, living, full and free,
Grace to last into eternity,
Por me, for me.
43 Power to conquer every stubborn foe,
Power to bid the alluring tempter go,
Power to make this world a heaven below,
For me, for me.
44 0 the peace my Saviour gives,
Peace I never knew before ;
For my life has brighter grown,
Since I learned to trust Him more.
45 Jov I joy ! wonderful joy !
Peace ! peace ! naught can destroy !
Love 1 love ! so boundless and free!
All this my Lord gives to me.
4(3 I will love Thee, Saviour,
Thou art mine forever ;
Nothing but Thy favour,
My soul can satisfy.
47 Speak Lord, speak Lord,for Thy servant
heareth;
Speak Lord, speak Lord, for Thy servant
heareth;
Now Lord, now Lord, all my sins con-
fessing ;
Thou Lord, Thou Lord, all my soul
possessing.
48 At the Cross, at the Cross,
Where I first saw the light,
And the burden of my heart roll’d away,
It was there by faith
I received my sight,
And now I am happy all the day.
49 Gone is my burden, He roll’d it away,
Opened my eyes to the light of the day ;
Now in the fullness of joy I can say,
I’m happy, I’m happy in Jesus.
50. Thou art a mighty Saviour,
Thy love doth never waver ;
Thou shalt be mine forever,
And Thine alone I’ll be.
51 Oh, how I love Jesus,
Oh, how I love Jesus,
Oh, how I love Jesus,
Because He first loved me.
52 Hallelujah ! hallelujah ! I love Thee
my Saviour ;
Hallelujah ! hallelujah ! I trust but iu
Thee I
53 What a wonderful Saviour is Jesus,
my Jesus ;
What a wonderful Saviour is Jesus,
my Lord.
54 I have not much to give Thee, Lord,
For that great love that made me
Thine ;
I have not much to give Thee, Lord,
But all I have is Thine.
55 I’ve let the dear Master come in,
His blood now cleanses from sin ;
I’ll sing evermore, the conflict is o’er,
I’ve let the dear Master come in.
56 Fully trusting in the battle’s fray,
Fully trusting Jesus all the way,
Fully trusting—this the surest stay ;
Trusting alone in Jesus !
57 Oh, the love of Jesus !
Boundless love of Jesus !
He loves me tho’ I cannot tell why.
58 Justified now I am
Saved by the bleeding lamb, [sight,
Made pure and white in God’s own
Yes, justified now 1 am.
