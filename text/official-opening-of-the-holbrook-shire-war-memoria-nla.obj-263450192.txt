WAR MEMORIAL
The Swimming Pool is the Holbrook Shire's War Memorial in honour
of the 280 men and women who enlisted in the Services during
World War II and a Memorial to the 20 men who paid the Supreme
Sacrifice.
“Lest Me Forget”
A clock with two dials—one facing north and the other west —has been
provided in a clock tower at the Pool. The letters lest we forget
are depicted in lien of the usual numerals on the clock faces. This
clock will be illuminated each night throughout the year by way of
connection to the street lights, which at present are lit from dusk
to 3 a.m.


THE SWIMMING POOL PROJECT
HE PROPOSAL to build the pool dates back to February,
I J 1946, when the then Shire President (Clr. John Ross)
suggested to the Holbrook Shire Council that the District’s
War Memorial take the form of a swimming pool.
A public meeting endorsed the suggestion and a committee,
with Clr. I. P. Kane as Chairman, was formed to further this matter.
The Committee, after examining the proposal, agreed to ask
Council to construct the pool and itself undertook to solicit contri-
butions for the project.
In 1954, Council agreed to build the pool then tentatively
estimated to cost £32,000 on the basis of public contribution of
£12,000, Government Grant £B,OOO and Council £12,000.
Much activity took place over the next few years—several sketch
plans were prepared; many sites were considered; numerous inter-
views and conferences were held; inspections of pools elsewhere were
carried out; much pressure was put on the Government to provide
or promise a grant, but it was not until 1958 that Council agreed
to call tenders for the project, after appointing a firm of Architects
to prepare full plans and specifications. In the meanwhile, the
Committee continued with its drive for funds. At that time no
definite promise of a Government grant was forthcoming and Council
was advised that if it proceeded and completed the pool before a
grant was promised no contribution by the Government would
be made. As the amount of the subsidy could be £lO,OOO, Council
felt that such a sum should not lightly be brushed aside and further
patience might be rewarded.
In 1959, after repeated requests, the Government offered Council
a grant of 25 per cent, of the cost of the pool with a maximum of
£lO,OOO. Tenders were at once called and eventually two contracts
—one for the pool and the other for the filtration plant—were signed.
The pool contractors, Messrs. K. McCallum & Son, commenced
work in February, 1959, but wet weather held up progress. Council,
in an endeavour to hasten on construction, assisted considerably
with concrete work. The tendered price of the two contracts plus
the cost of improvements of the pool surrounds will reach £45,500,
which is estimated to be the final cost of the project.
The pool is owned by and under the control of the Holbrook
Shire Council, and has been leased to Mr. K. J. Barber for the
current season 1961-62.


FINANCIAL
Council’s plan of financing the pool is unique and well worthy of
mention. The total cost—£4s,so0 —has been provided: £13,300 by
public contribution, £lO,OOO Government Grant and the balance of
£22,200 by Council.
The public Committee is to be highly commended for its untiring
efforts in raising £13,300 —a splendid contribution to Holbrook’s War
Memorial.
In addition, Council is very appreciative of a Government Grant of
£lO,OOO, which is the maximum under the present Government’s
policy.
Council’s share—£22,2oo —has been provided without an increase in
rates, without the imposition of special rates and without resort to
borrowing. By a systematic allocation over a number of years
Council has been able to accumulate this total amount without
impairing its financial resources.
