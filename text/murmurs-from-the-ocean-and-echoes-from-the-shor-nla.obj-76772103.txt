PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION.
Encouraged by the kind reception which my effusions have
received at the hands of a genial and generous Press, and an
appreciative community, this second edition of ? Murmurs
from the Ocean? is herewith issued. I have endeavoured to
improve several lines and an occasional expression, but the
alterations are few, and the ?music? is the same. To meet
the wishes and the wants of friends who have regard to
quantity as well as quality, some pieces of a local character*
have been added to the collection, under the contra-distinctive
title of ?Echoes from the Shore.? While the ?murmurs?
may be welcome to persons on shore, the ?echoes? may be
particularly welcome to passengers on board ship when far
upon the ? melancholy main.? To those who object to
? murmurs ? of any sort, these truly Adelaidean Xi echoes?
may possibly prove acceptable.
THE AUTHOR.
Adelaide, April, 1881.

N* board the good ship ? Collingrove,?
� For England?s coast we steer,
To see once more our native home
And friends we hold most dear.
Friends goovi and kind we leave behind
Our gulf manoeuvres eye,
When with a sigh we wave on high
Our fond and last good-bye !
Borne by a steady, fav?ring breeze
We hail the foaming spray,
As gallantly our noble ship
Speeds on her homeward way.
Our captain is a seaman bold ?
To equal him but few ;
His pride is in his noble ship
And in his gallant crew.
God speed the good ship Collingrove?
Across the deep blue sea, ?
From tempests wild and hurricanes
And ev?ry danger free.
O hour of joy ! when we approach
Old England?s distant shore,
When we with gladsome hearts behold
Our native land once more.
p f'ALL y^LOFT
UR ship for Afric?s distant shore
? Speeds on her way with pride,
And bounding o?er the crested waves
She shakes the spray aside.
Our hearts are fill?d with highest hope,
Our minds with visions bright;
With fav?ring winds we soon expect
Old Afric?s shore in sight.


But suddenly our sky of joy
Is darkly overcast,
And shades of gloom sweep o?er our mind
By dire misfortune?s blast.
From topsail-yard Jack Walton fell
Upon the vessel?s deck,
Where bruis?d and shatter?d, hours he lay
A hopeless human wreck.
Those dreadful hours I no mother near
To soothe her lov?d-one?s brow,
But kind and watchful sailors tend
Their d} lag messmate now.
No monumental stone has he
To mark where lies his head,
Nor can we plant a tender flower
' Where sleeps the humble dead.
p jSTOF\M AT jSEA.
sketch not drawn from the imagination but from actual
experience.?Ship, The Collingrove ; Captain, Angel ;
locality, Indian Ocean, near S.E. coast of Africa; time,
April, 1873.
?f�rKlS night upon the deep, and through the gloom
With awful reckless speed we onward dash;
The blinding lightnings gleam throughout the sky,
And deaf?ning thunders roll incessantly ;
The threat?ning heav?ns, surcharg?d, their flood-gates burst
And pour their torrents with astounding force.
Our captain, ever watchful of his charge,
By measures prompt seems ready to defy
The angry spirit of the coming storm.
The wind, increasing fast, now sharp and shrill
Shrieks through the cordage of our wave-toss?d bark,
And ?sweeping o?er the awe-inspiring scene,
Destruction seemingly upon its wing?
Like an infuriated demon raves.
The fierce and surly blast, as if in spite
At our defiant, fearless attitude,
Veers round at once, and strikes us from ahead
With shock tremendous ; a terrific squall
Has suddenly thus taken us aback.
Oh ! must we perish, God, and be engulphed
By overwhelming seas?our dying wail
Mock?d by the cruel and remorseless wind?
Or shall we yet survive the fearful din
And war of elements tumultuous ?


Thou power Supreme ! who rulest wind and wave,
If in accordance with Thy Sovereign will,
Regard us tenderly, stretch forth Thy arm
And wrest us from the all devouring grasp
And greed of ocean ?wild and treacherous ;
Forsake us not in our extremity,
But look on us with sympathetic eye.
And lend Thy helping hand, we humbly pray.
How dread the rush and roar of win I and wave I
The horrid flap of canvas on the masts
Assails the ear with terrifying noise.
Our vessel heeling over as she does
On her beam-ends, we fancy she will turn
Or that the topmasts certainly will go.
Confusion wildly for a time prevails ;
The voices of the captain and the mate,
Though trumpet-toned, are indistinctly heard
Amidst the howling of the raging storm.
Some seamen, helped by willing passengers,
Pull strenuously at sundry ropes on deck,
While others of the crew, at duty?s call,
The rigging quickly mount to furl the sail.
The order?s difficult, and stern commands,
Are with amazing promptitude obey?d ;
To use a seaman?s phrase, our ship ?pays off,?
And by her topsails goes before i he wind,
And all is then comparatively safe.
For two succeeding days, squall after squall
Attacks our bark ; the billows rising high
Break o?er us now and then and sweep the deck,
Or thunder down the skylight or the hatch ?
Alarming timid passengers below.
Sail after sail in ribbons has been torn
By force of wind ; it is our summer suit ?
Our lightest canvas that is being used ?
Stuff strong enough for gently-fanning airs,
But scarcely suitable for gales like these.
Dispirited, the sailors raise no more
Their cheerful, work-alleviating song,
But toil in moody silence night and day.
The lonely look-out cannot safely watch
?Gainst danger on the wave-swept ? focs?le-head,?
But he securely on the deck-house stands,
And there his dreary midnight vigil keeps.
Next morn, with fairer wind and less?ning sea,
We fast approach the coast of Africa ;
Then for a week along her rocky strand
We view her jaggy peaks and headlands bold
Before we enter into Table Bay.


Pape Jown
SHE *? Colliugrove ? on Sabbath day
Sailed slowly into Table Bay;
Next morn on Afric?s shore we stray,
And through the town,
Where Dutch-built stoeps* obstruct the way,
Stroll up and down.
Since Adam husbandry began,
Man ever has pursued the plan
Of studying his fellow man ;
Here is a place
Where one amusingly may scan
The human race.
Of Zulu, Kafir, Hottentot,
And dusky sons of regions hot,
And Africands, a varied lot
Of endless hue;
A startling picture we have got
Full on our view.
Most diverse races, void of spite
Here, friendly-like, mix and unite
By sacred, matrimonial rite,
And strangely blend ;
You smile, but sober truth I write,
You may depend.
Ye Dutchmen 1 ever thank your stars
That British soldiers, British tars,
Conducted by the warlike Mars,
Entered your bay.
Believing you of civil jars
And petty sway.
Cape Town, with stoeps, a stupid place,
Would still have been devoid of grace
Had it progressed at your slow pace
And sluggish will;
But now it wears more modern face
British skill.
Upon our left, with sweet delight,
We have the Svgarloaf f in sight,
The Lion J couchant on our right;
And o'er the town
The Table Mount from giddy height
Looks darkly down.
*Stoeps?pronounced stoops? i.e., steps which occur in front of the houses
and frequently project to the kerbstones; f and % mountains.


No longer here we can abide;
Cape Town, farewell I as now we ride
Upon the restless, rolling tide,
Clouds overhead
Steal down the Table Mountain?s side
And cloth-like spread.
jbT. j^ELENA,
fnrhlE�D of our most ignoble ease
The ocean?s wonders fail to please,
And dulness seems to bear the sway
Throughout the live-long, tedious day#
Ten days from Cape Town with delight
We hear the cry, ? Land, land in sight 1 ?
And soon at St. Helena?s isle
The ? Collingrove ? rests for a while.
Exhilarated with the change,
In quest of prospects new and strange
We gain the shore without delay,
For short will be our passing stay.
With all their death-dispensing gear
Grim-looking fortresses appear,
And bristling cannons meet the sight
On ev?ry practicable height.
A wall (with gate closed ev?ry night)
Extending from the left to right
Connects on either side a height
And hides the township from our sight;
Before an entrance can be made
You go along an esplanade
Until you reach the island?s gate?
Through which you pass ?if not too late .
Jamestown, between the lofty hills,
The narrow valley wedge-like fills.
Inside the gate there is a space
Not void of ornament and grace,
Termed by the islanders the square,
And certainly beyond compare
The finest portion of the town,
Which, as we saunter up and down
Seems in dilapidated state?
Doom?d by some stem impending fate
A varied lot of Afric?s race
Here poorly find a dwelling-place;


And orange-coloured beauties cast
Their sweetest glance as we go past.
By means of ladder on our right
We scale the giddy towering height,
And from the summit of the steep
Survey the vast and trackless deep,
Which oft-times, furious and wild,
Assumes a mood and mien most mild ;
Like sleeping child on mother?s breast
Our bark enjoys a peaceful rest.
A hasty glance we downward throw
Upon the humble town below ;
And inland with delighted eye
In wildest grandeur we descry
Hills finely wooded, reaching high,
And frowning rocks that pierce the sky.
There is a spot of sacred ground
Amid those scenes, sought out and found
By eager pilgrims when they land
Upon this rocky, rugged strand.
Here in this labyrinthian maze,
Secluded from the world?s rude gaze,
Napoleon dwelt in lone exile
A prisoner upon the isle.
Ambition?s proud, unhappy son,
Torn from the empire he had won,
His crush?d and humble spirit sped
To mingle with the mighty dead.
And in Sane valley?s lonesome shade
The Emperor was lowly laid.
We now descend the huge built stair
And to the lonely tomb repair.
We leave the little town behind
And in the vale neat villas find,
On hillside or in cozy nook
Close by the margin of a brook
Which, murm?ring as it flows along,
Attracts our ear like plaintive song.
An uphill path we now pursue
Enlarging more and more our view ;
When, lo 1 a scene enchants our sight,
And fills our souls with rare delight?
A dashing cascade on our right
Leaps boldly from terrific height.
In rich profusion here are seen
High hills and verdant vales between ;
There sunny slopes and rocky fells
And far below deep darksome dells ;
Here nature smiles with sweetest grace
There darkly frowns with sternest face.
We leave the charming scene behind,


Impress?d for ever on our mind;
And our ascent now at an end
Adown the vale our way we wend.
The simple slab, which does not tell
Aught of the conqueror who fell,
The shady trees, and fount close by
While standing reverently nigh
We view with melancholy eye
And Pity rising, heaves a sigh.
But fleet-wing?d time flies fast away,
Our Angel warned us not to stay ;
So longer here we cannot dwell,
O 1 St. Helena, fare thee well I

an[d Jaunts of
(Part of a Poem entitled ? Scotland Revisited.?)
?HAT glowing terms can I employ
To give expression to the joy
That fills my heart when England?s shore
Bursts on our longing sight once more,
Or when at length, by speedy train,
I reach my native soil again ?
The links that bind me to thy strand,
Dear Scotia, my native land !
Though riveted in days long past
While life remains will firmly last;
And Time?s rude hand will never stain
The brightness of the love-wrought chain.
O Glasgow 1 city of my birth?
Scene of my boyhood?s thoughtless mirth?
The love for thee, I would confess,
No verse cf mine could e?er express ;
Nor Eloquence herself could tell
Aught of the springs of joy that well
O?erflowing in my bosom?s core
As thee I proudly view once more.
The rapid progress thou hast made
In varied industry and trade,
Throughout the earth is widely known ;
Thy boundaries have vastly grown
In size, in influence, and wealth.
How vigorous thy civic health !
Vile Sloth and all its kindred race
Can?t reckon thee their chosen place ;
And empty pleasure, worthless ease,
Thou wishest, carest not to please.
? Let Glasgow flourish 1? has indeed
Thy motto been ; no useless weed
Roots firmly in thy labour?s field ;
Thy grand success is like the yield?
The harvest of some fruitful soil


Attended to by care and toil.
Long may?st thou flourish and succeed
In noble effort, worthy deed,
And anxious to avoid decay
The flag of righteousness display.
More sacred sentiments than pride
Within my faithful heart preside,
For there like ocean, deep and wide,
Emotion heaves its swelling tide.
The joy of him who long from home
Approaches the parental dome,
Or seaman, months upon the main,
Expecting soon the shore to gain,
When from the giddy topmast?s height
He sees his native land in sight,?
Such is the joy with which I view
Thy busy thoroughfares anew.
The soldier from the wars return?d,
Whose heart has oft-times danger spurn?d,
But when he meets his lov?d one?s face
Melts in a long and fond embrace,
Tastes of a joy that is divine ?
An ecstasy akin to mine
When welcom?d by affection?s clasp,
Or friendship?s warm and kindly grasp.
O pure Affection ! I opine
Thou shinest with a light divine ;
What man respecteth not thy name,
Or glows not at thy holy flame ?
And Friendship, thy companion sweet,
Holds fellowship with thee most meet ?
For she when true is ever found
Our help in trouble?s dreary round,
Our comfort in this vale of tears,
And solace in declining years.
As gold is mix?d oft with alloy,
A sadness mingles with my joy,
While missing friends of former date,
Who in their spring-time met their fate,
Or those of kindred?s sacred time
Who cold and silent lowly lie ;
And, musing on my early years,
A sorrow measur?d not by tears
Points to their graves, directs my way,
And bids me there my homage pay.
As lonely, pensively, I stray
Amidst the haunts of boyhood?s day,
Or as I join some joyous throng
Whose hearts are tun?d to friendship?s song,
Or mingle with companions gay
Well-known in days now pass?d away,


Bright visions of the happy past
Their magic spell around me cast;
And scenes of youth again appear
With all their recollections dear.
0 ! happy hours of boyhood?s day,
When hope shone forth with dazzling ray
Upon my then untrodden way,
And all seem?d cheerful, bright, and gay?
But like a summer morn most fair
Obscured here long by gloomy air,
The charming prospects of the past
Alas ! were quickly overcast;
And vanish?d now youth?s idle dreams,
Hope still shines on with milder beams.
My native Clyde ! again with pride
1 view thy gently flowing tide,
And as I wander by thy stream
Life?s sunny morn ?as in a dream
Or fleeting vision of the night?
Returns with all its colours bright.
How oft at close of sultry day
We merry boys would wend our way
To Harvie?s Dyke, where on thy breast
We wantonly disturbed thy rest !
How oft far past Dalmarnock Brig
In skiff, or jolly-boat, or gig
We woke the echoes of thy shore
While skilfully we plied the oar I
How oft thy windings we would trace
?Mid scenes of softest sylvan grace ; .
And as along thy banks we stray?d
Wild-springing flow?rs their charms display?d.
While warblers of the woodlands near
Trill?d sweetly to the list?ning ear !
How oft by Rutherglen, Carmyle,
And Kenmuir steep we rov?d the while;
Or turning from thy banks aside,
Though deck?d in all their summer pride,
With lightsome footsteps bent our way
To Cathkin?s gently-swelling brae,
When gazing o?er the verdant plain
We mark?d thy silver tide again,
As midst the woods and pastures green
Thou sparkling here and there wert seen 1
Once more, as in the days gone by,
Thy scenes of beauty I descry ;
But where are now the gladsome boys
Who joined me in my youthful joys ?
While missing some I mourn for those
Who in Death?s dreamless sleep repose
Like barks that ride in peaceful bay,


Some still in sweet contentment stay
Close by the margin of thy tide,
Wnile others, scatter?d far and wide
Have drifted from their native clime, ?
Such are the changes wrought by time.
-But as the ivy, fresh as Spring,
To time-worn walls will fondly cling
Or as the tendrils of the vine
Will round the trellis intertwine,
So round my heart while life shall last,
The scenes and friends of days gone past,
As through departed years they shine,
Iheir happy memories will twine.
Hail, Broomielaw I where ships immense
upi ear their masts like forest dense :
Adown the masted avenue
We slowly, steadily pursue
Our cautious way, then swiftly glide
Where flows a less obstructed tide.
Our steamer is a splendid craft,
Deck'd with saloon both fore and aft?
beauty, size, and speed, the queen
Of Britain?s river boats, I ween.
All British tourists know her name,
And loudly speak ?lona?s ? fame.
A shallow stream not long ago,
Leviathans pass to and fro
Where in the memory of man,
When present century began,
Such water?s flow?d ?twixt either shore
As easily were waded o?er ;
And now bank?d in and close confin?d
It seems canal-like to the mind.
Vast scenes of industry appear
Where clank of hammers dins the ear,
And skeletons of mighty ships
Are seen like spectres on the slips.
As down the stream we smoothly glide
Rare beauty beams on either side ;
Here waving fields and pastures green,
Or lawns with sylvan groups are seen,
Where opulence holds princely seat
In calm and undisturb?d retreat;
There gentle slope and wooded hill
The roving eye with pleasure fill.
As now and then we fix our gaze
Upon the wild-wood?s tangled maze,
Far in the distance we descry
Peaks proudly tow?ring to the sky.
Soon down the ever wid?ning tide
We gain the noble Frith of Clyde ;


Then sweeping south we steer our way
For Rothesay?s fair and tranquil bay.
The op'ning Frith?s majestic tide,
The towns which lie on either side,
Each winding loch and heath-clad hill
My bosom with emotion fill;
And with accord they one and all
The sunny hours of youth recall.
Whilst the ? lona ? fast explores
Her narrow route to Highland shores,
I rest and contemplate awhile
In Bute?s fair, fascinating isle.
By side of loch oft have I gazed,
With bosom thrill?d and mind amaz?d,
Where mountain solitudes most drear
Their forms in solemn grandeur rear.
Oft have I glanc?d across the deep
From Arran?s bold an I frowning steep,
Rejoiced in Nature?s fairest smile
When wand?ring o?er Bute?s lovely isle;
Stood on the Largs? historic shore,
So fatal to the Danes of yore ;
Rowed with a skilful, daring hand
From Ayrshire to the Cumbray?s strand;
Or from some height surveyed with pride
The sunlit isles that gem the Clyde.
Oft have I scann?d from Girvan?s beach
The channel?s furthest southern reach ;
Viewed Ailsa Craig?that lonely rock
Where wild and shrieking seamews flock ;
Or to the south, in hazy line,
Spied Brin?s coast when days were fine.
Deep was the secret, heartfelt joy
That stirr?d within me when a boy
I viewed from rugged mountain side
The matchless features of the Clyde.
Though many years since then have flown
And I to manhood?s state have grown,
In distant and more sunny climes,
Yet still the joy of other times
Was not so deep?l must avow?
As that which stirs my bosom now.
My warm affection heretofore
Time has intensified the more,
And, undiscerned in days gone by,
Fresh beauty captivates the eye.
Soon shall I leave my native shore,
Perhaps to visit it no more,
But scenes like these, though left behind,
Will fix their impress on my mind,
And oft in pleasant dream by night


Will yield me rapturous delight.
Surveying Nature?s grand array,
With all her manifold display
Of quiet beauty, wildest grace,
The loving hand of God I trace.
This mighty handiwork Divine
Demands a nobler strain than mine.
But in my unaspiring lay
I must my adoration pay
To Him who is afar and nigh,
Eternal, Infinite, Most High !
Composed on board of the ? Raven ? while sailing down the
Clyde bound for Liverpool, en route for London, to take
passage for Australia.,
DIED I ye glens where long-ago
The mighty Wallace won
. His deathless fame and honor?d name
As freedom?s noblest son.
Adieu ! ye plains where gallant Bruce
His dauntless heroes led
To save the soil from despot?s spoil
Or sink in gory bed.
Adieu I ye shrines where martyrs sleep
Who fell in days of yore,
When terrors brand in bloody hand
Swept o?er the troubled shore.
Adieu 1 ye haunts of early youth,
And joyous days gone past,
But dear to me you?ll ever be
While memory shall last.
Adieu ! ye fair, enchanting scenes,
On Clyde?s romantic shore,
Where one may trace the varied grace
Of Nature?s boundless store.
Adieu! ye dim and distant hills
Now fading from our sight,
As speeding fast before the blast
The ? Raven? takes her flight.

S birds, driv?n by the icy breath of North,
Fly from the English coast in winter-time

So we, before the driving northern blast,
By spread of sail have wing?d our bird-like flight
To seas more sunny, milder latitudes.
Fann?d by the genial ? trades,? our gallant ship
Now steadily pursues her lonely way.
Upon our world of waters Sol has set
In gorgeous grandeur in the glowing west;
And evening?s shadows scarce begin to fall
When lo 1 they flee before approaching light.
No chilling mists or suffocating fogs
Best on the heaving bosom of the deep,
Shrouding us in impenetrable gloom?
But all is bright and beautifully clear,
Seeming to us but as a milder day.
Fair Luna?peaceful goddess of the night?
Attended by her countless starry train,
Slowly ascends the high ethereal arch
And smiles upon the sublunary scene.
No heavy mass of vapour overhead
Frowns darkly on our solitary course ;
A few thin clouds, bright with the silv?ry light,
Adorn and beautify the moonlit air ;
The wavelets of the ever restless sea
Sparkling so lustrously like precious gems,
Reflect resplendently the lunar ray.
It is a heavenly night, a scene most fit
For contemplation?s meditative hour.
Musing upon our ocean loneliness
A deep solemnity pervades the mind ;
But yet our quiet progress o?er the main,
The glitt?ring, playful waters, and the sky
Illum?d by such a rich and mellow light
Breathe to the soul peace and tranquility.
Our thoughts upon the buoyant wings of faith
Rise from the finite to the Infinite;


Though silence reigns among the orbs of heav?n
(No speech or language there is ever heard)
Yet they declare with truthful eloquence
The awful presence of Omnipotence.
We yield the tribute of our love and praise
To that great Power who rules the winds and waves,
And guides unerringly the circling worlds
While they roll round in their eternal spheres.

Those glassy seas that mirror tropic skies ;
The genial ? trades ? have gently died away.
Though not a breath of air comes o?er the sea
Its bosom heaves with long, deep rolling swells ?
The token of some past and distant storm.
Our sails hang loosely from the spreading yards,
Or idly flap against the tow?ring masts.
Through tedious hours the mighty lord of day
Has gazed upon the scene with eye most stern,
But now that he descends the western steep
Of heaven?s high arch, he seems relentingly
To make amends for his severity.
Thin fleecy clouds serve as a welcome veil
To screen us from the fierce intensity
And dazzling brightness of the solar rays.
At length Sol disappears beyond the wave,
His fading beams replete with loveliness.
O ! what magnificence enrobes the West,
What golden glories meet our raptur?d sight;
High in the heav?ns extends a mellow light
That slowly melts in graduated shade ;
The clouds?the sky?s most gorgeous drapery?
With ample fold and varied tint and hue,
Enhance the beauty of the Occident.

And spurns the dashing spray.
Far past the Cape of hopeful name,

And soon, with fay?ring gales, we hope
The welcome port to gain.
No sadd?ning thought or dream had we
Of future evil day ;
Fair fortune?s smile and hope?s bright beam
Had cheered us on our way.
But sorrow casts its gloomy shades
Upon the scene at last ;
The piercing cry, ? man overboard 1 ?
Is heard above the blast.
A gallant seaman, loved by all?
So trusty, true, and bold?
Whilst high aloft at duty?s call
Had lost his wonted hold.
He fell into the angry sea,
A cry for help he gave,
But sweeping past our vessel left
Him battling with the wave.
Remorseless waves ! that rise and rage
Lashed by the passing gale,
Against your wrath, will tears and sighs,
And courage naught avail ?j
Hove to, six men in beat go forth
Their much-lov?d friend to save ;
But all in vain 1 he sank o?erwhelmed
death?s dark-swelling wave.
Thus far from home and kindred dear
Poor Christian Olsen died,
But shame to me if to his worth
A tribute were denied.

A LAMENT FOR ? ELLIE.?
(Mrs. G. R. Debney, a well-known writer under th e K nom de
plume of ? Ellie,? died on February 25th, 1870.)
Although the author wishes not to parade the productions of
youth,the two pieces on ?Ellie? are inserted in this collection
as, possibly, they may be read with pleasure by the friends and
admirers of the departed poetess.
AIR flower, but yesterday in bloom I
Australia mourns her early doom,
The thickest, darkest shades of gloom
Obscure her brow?
For raould?ring in the silent tomb
Lies ? Ellie? now.
Free from the wild, tempestuous roar
Of Time?s storm-beaten, rugged shore,
Though we her absence now deplore
She?s safe at rest;
She tunes the lyre for evermore
Amongst the blest.
Ye tuneful warblers of the vale I
That sweetly pipe your simple tale
In your retreats, our loss bewail
In mournful song ;
Bear on thy wings, O summer gale 1
The notes along.
Ye forest songsters I as you spring
From bough to bough on joyous wing,
Some strains of melancholy sing
For her away ;
Yea, let the shady woodlands ring
With doleful lay.
Ye hills ! that proudly tow?r so high.
And fondly kiss the bending sky,
Resound the sympathetic cry
For her who?s gone ;
Ye summer winds ! that faintly sigh,
Our loss bemoan.


THE MUSE?S LAMENT FOI[ ?ELLIE.?
NE rosy morn, when in poetic mood,
> 1 slowly stray?d through a romantic wood ;
A maid appear?d?majestic, stately, fair ?
Who beamed with matchless grace and beauty rare.
The lovely one, in weeds of woe array?d,
Was wailing in a lone, delightful glade ;
She beat her breast, and her dishevel?d hair
Was waving wildly in the morning air.
It was the Muse who thus lamented here ;
With rev?rent, awe-struck feelings I stood near,
And whilst she fill?d the air with plaintive cries,
Tears dimm?d the flashing lightning of her eyes.
She said, ? My much-loved ? Ellie? is no more ;
Are there no bards on South Australia?s shore
To weep for her in sympathetic strain.
Who ne?er shall strike the tuneful lyre again ?
? Shall spotless worth and an unsullied name
Not wear the rightful crown of honest fame ?
And overwhelm?d by death?s dark, swelling wave
Shall ?Ellie? sink unsung into the grave?
? Ye sleeping bards of South Australia?s strand !
Why weep you not in sympathetic band ?
Awake I the notes of lamentation pour.
In saddest strains our mournful loss deplore.
" The songsters of the wood on budding sprays
Bewail our loss in melancholy lays;
The gently-sighing wind and rustling leaf
Proclaim the tale of universal grief.
?No more on earth she?ll shed poetic rays,
Or tune her seraph-voice in simple lays,
But now she pours the tide of heav?nly song
With kindred spirits, ?midst the ransom?d throng.?
p AMENT FOR THE J-ATE pR. jBENSQ]^
(A BROTHER DRUID.)
AD, sad at heart, we bow the head,
For Benson slumbers with the dead;
His genial soul from earth has sped,
But like a star,
With virtue?s rays, it still shall shed
Light from afar.


Ye suffering poor ! who in your pain
Oft look for sympathy in vain,
Your loss bewail; a friend is ta?en
Whose tenderness,
Unmixed with sordid thought of gain,
Relieved distress.
Ye brothers of the healing art I
Well may the tear of sorrow start
For him, whose worthy, noble part
Is ended now ;
0 ! mourn for him with loving heart
And sadden?d brow.
Ye joyless minstrels of this shore I
The swelling tide of sorrow pour
For him, whose face we never more
Shall see again;
Our lamentable loss deplore
In saddest strain.
Thou ! who most keenly feel?st the blow?
A country, warm with pity?s glow,
Shares in thy grief for him laid low,
And at his shrine
The tears of sympathy now flow
For thee and thine.
Though torn from us in early prime,
Yet his life labour was sublime !
Such worth, why spared so brief a time ?
Now he?s at rest,
His soul inhabiting the clime
Where live the blest.
j^ROLOGUE
Spoken at a Druids? Entertainment, specially inserted
brother Druids and ?kindred societies.?
t MIDST the cares harassing, troubles rife
And wonderful vicissitudes of life,
How sweet and soothing to the wearied mind
The social fellowship of human kind I
And in the darksome time of dire distress,
How we do yearn with wistful eagerness
For trusty friendship?s gloom-dispelling rays
From intimates of former, brighter days.
If they forsake us not in hour of need,
Then can we recognise them friends indeed ;
But if unfriendly-like they pass us by


With look disdainful or averted eye,
Their bosoms cold that once appeared to glow,
We feel the thrust and sink beneath the blow.
Enduring Friendship?soul-inspiring name ?
Whose bosom warms not at thy heav?nly flame,
And midst the cold neglects of earth below
Who values not thy warm and kindly glow ?
Thou paint?st the rainbow in our vale of tears,
And yield?st sweet solace in declining years.
I humbly think I need not now explain
The worthy objects that we seek to gain ;
Let it suffice to say that friendship?s fire
The heart Druidic ever will inspire.
Unlike the Druids of historic page,
The worthy order of a barb?rous age,
No secresy or mystic rites abound,
But Concord, Peace, and Unity are found
Within our walls, and brotherly combin?d,
We love each other and our fellow-kind.
Brave gentlemen, and ladies fair and bright
(If ladies you come secondly this time,
Please blame the stern necessities of rhyme)?
A Druids? welcome to you all to-night;
This ev?ning music?soul-refining art I
Will please the ear and influence the heart;
And till its cadences shall die away
We?ll proudly own its fascinating sway;
The charms of elocution and of song
Will gild the moments as they glide along.
A worthy gentleman, of well-known name
And wide-spread elocutionary fame,
In telling tones the story will narrate,
How dauntless Tell defied the Austrian State.
The thoughts of sighiog lovers he?ll enchain
When he addresses them in tender strain,
And gives the counsel wise?wed not for gold,?
As Love can ne?er be barter?d, bought, or sold.
Songs will be sung, of varied sort and kind,
To entertain each individual mind?
The strain pathetic, or the merry lay,
To suit the sentimental or the gay.
The help and presence of our friends to-night
Yield boundless pleasure and unmix?d delight;
Our thanks we offer in the Druids? name,
And hope they kindly will accept the same.


CLARK?S LECTURE ON WESTMINSTER
ABBEY,
ITH hearty welcome to our sunny shore
We greet the prince of orators once more.
His voice, so musically sweet and clear,
Music itself, still captivates the ear.
In strains of eloquence, his thoughts sublime,
Revive within our minds the antique time,
And we, spell-bound by his entrancing style,
Behold old England?s venerable pile,
Round which, like ivy twining, fresh as Spring,
The stirring memories of ages cling.
Borne by the flowing oratoric tide,
Adown the centuries we swiftly glide,
And glorious visions of the by-gone days
Shine on us now with undiminish?d rays.
Historic scenes of interest meet our sight?
Scenes dark with sadness or with pleasure bright,
Which, understood, are ready to impart
Their teeming lessons to the mind and heart.
Kings, queens, and nobles pass in grand review,
Enact their pomp and pageantry anew,
While England?s worthies ?worthy of the name ?
Each adding lustre to his country?s fame,
In bright and glorious succession rise
And act their part before observant eyes.
0 ! may the Abbey, venerable pile,
Still grace for centuries our mother isle ;
And may the ashes of departed worth
That lie within its consecrated earth,
By Britain?s mighty power be shielded long
From sacrilegious, desecrating throng.
A few hours, and the orator no more
May glad again our oft-delighted shore,
But though his voice we nevermore may hear,
His sweet, clear tones will linger in our ear,
And memory, methinks will oft recall
The fascination of his wondrous thrall.
CHINAPHOBIA,
Y theme, 0 Muse! the Chinaphobist band,
Whose ravings wild resound throughout the land.
Come, Satire, to my aid, and in fit song
Immortalize this maniacal throng.


Out of their proper track they wander far,
Led or misled by some bewitching ?Star?
Which, like a will-o?-wisp, but leads astray
All those beguiled by its deceitful ray.
Their minds, distracted with ignoble fear?
Vast hordes of Chinese vagabonds appear
Usurping speedily upon our soil
The lawful place of British sons of toil.
Prosperity?s refulgent sun has shed
His brightest glories ; now his beams have fled r
And shadows, dismal, dark, creep on apace,
F�recasting to the European race
The ruin and the misery in store
When China bursts in earnest on our shore.
Such are the insane ravings, wild and loud,
Of all the crazy Chinaphobist crowd ;
But still far worse, to guard our sacred shore
From Mongol vagrants, justice they ignore,
Regarding truth as strangely out of place
In dealing with the persecuted race.
They yield to them the term Celestial,
But grudge them aught that is terrestrial.
Thus they apostrophise the Chinese name?
-4 Sons of perdition, whose dark deeds of shame,
Where?er you visit, in whatever clime,
Stand forth the blackest on the page of crime ;
Possess?d of honour, virtue, not a grain
Corruption ever follows in your train,
Monopolising all the arts of hell,
In villainy alone you far excel.?
Slanders like these, most recklessly they frame
To rob the moon-face of his honest fame.
Are truth and justice banish?d from our shore ?
If so, their speedy presence I implore.
Let reason once assert supreme command,
Then the misguided Chinaphobist band,
Ashamed, will cease to din our troubled ears
With downright nonsense and their idle fears ;
And thenceforth, by objections*sound and strong,
Try to avert the hated Chinese throng.
May reason, truth, and justice, all combin?d,
For ever regulate the public mind,
Then will the Chinese question, soon or late,
Be well and wisely settled by the State.


INTEMPERANCE. A SATIRE.
Suggested by the utterance of a well-known member of Par-
liament*? ?Let drunkards drink until they hurst.? Im-
pressed with the kindness and wisdom of this parliamentary
expression, we determined to embalm the praiseworthy
thought in imperishable rhyme. After waiting for the hour
of inspiration, the following verses were the result. Per-
sonally we do not scorn drunkards, but heartily pity them.
RINK on, ye drunkards I Drink away!
Care not what Burnett?s host may say;
. Still mingle in the broiling fray
And eaizer fight,
C 1 0 7
Where alcoholic spirits play
By day and night.
Though all the sober-minded race
For ever brand you with disgrace,
Ne?er mind a jot; be yours the place
And heart-felt glee
To join with joy-bespeaking face
The jolly spree.
When earth-born cares your soul annoy,
Let vain allurements ne?er decoy
You from the haunts of social joy
And comrades gay,
But there in booze the hours employ
All night and day.
Whilst yet the sparkling glass goes round,
Let mirth and merriment abound,
And madd?ning revelry resound
Like jangling bells ;
Till prostrate heroes strew the ground
Or crowd the cells.
Leave children dear and trusting wife,
Those plagues upon your boozing life,
And in the bacchanalian strife
Forget them all,
Till misery and ruin rife
Shall on them fall.
Regardless of their woe and pain,
Heed not their voice when they complain
Laugh at the tears that fall in vain,
And feed the fire,
Till wild delirium seize your brain,
And you expire.


When cold and silent in the ground,
Though fame your virtues ne?er shall sound,
Or sanctify your narrow mound,
Yet o?er your dross
Your boon companions , standing round,
Will mourn your loss.
SOUTH AUSTRALIAN VOLUNTEERS.
TSE politicians, holding high debate
On armaments, have oft been known to state
That soldier citizens for home defence
Were useless toys, incurring but expense,
And our protection, the most safe and sure,
Was to depend on helplessness secure ?
A doctrine this we fondly will receive
When black is white we firmly can believe.
Some statesmen, undisturb?d, sedate, and grave,
Assure us that Britannia rules the wave,
And that her tender bosom all aglow ?
With motherly devotion, she will throw
Around her children her protecting arm
When dangers threaten, or when foes alarm.
But if an enemy should by-and-bye
Elude her vigilance, escape her eye,
And hurl destruction on our peaceful shore
Must we for mercy shriek, for life implore ?
No, surely not 1 By all that we hold dear
A front of bold resistance we must rear ;
And when the rage and deadly combat burn,
Death and the foe we both alike will spurn.
?Tis only cowards who will meet with sneers
Or lightly prize the gallant Volunteers.
Ye craven-hearted curs I avaunt my sight,
Go, screen yourselves in shades of blackest night.
Who are the men whom you affect to scorn ?
Are they not Britons, or of Britons born,
Or sons of Europe?s nations, famed afar
For noble daring in the time of war ?
Why, truth to tell, the world?s best fighting blood
Streams through their swelling veins in spring-tide flood,


THE TRAITOR?S TERROR.
S\ C. F. MOODIE, mighty name !
/c) Soar high upon the wings of fame,
? For thou who can?st at pleasure tame
A Zulu chief,
Can?st editorial traitors shame
And bring to grief.
The noisy voice of rumour rang
Strathbogie outlaws would not hang,
For with thy Zulu thou wouldst bang
The assegai,
And Isandula?d, Kelly?s gang
Would sleep for aye.
But thou, it seems, was?t not the man
To hunt an outlaw?d robber clan ;
Thine were the more exalted plan
And nobler place,
The deeds of treason quick to scan
And sternly face.
Like Highland clansman, bold and brave,
Who would his chieftain?s honour save,
Thy loyal banner thou did?st wave
And seek revenge;
The Queen when slander?d by a knave
Thou didst avenge.
0 Moodie ! faithful to the Crown,
The Queen?s proud champion, ever frown
Upon her foes, and put them down
With mighty hand,
Till thy bright glory and renown
Illume our land.
POETS AND THEIR PROSPECTS,
UR starving poets on the spree
Exclaim, ?Hugh Fraser, here?s to thee 1?
And drink his health wi? muckle glee
And pleasure rare,
For he has got his well-won fee
For rhyming ware.


Rf joicing in the happy day
When rhyme received its proper pay,
The bards in merry, jovial lay
Extol their trade,
And loudly sing wi? bosoms gay
? Our fortune?s made.?
The cold, unsympathetic race
Who dwell in this uncultured place,
Turn round with cynical grimace
To hear their song,
Or with a proud, disdainful face
Pass quick along.
Ye bards ! your tones afford me pain
If such the burden of your strain,
True sympathy ne?er hope to gain ;
And of neglect
No more in whining voice complain,
Naught else expect.
If you for honours sigh and pine,
Let Mammon breathe not in a line,
But let the Muse?s light divine
Spread far and near,
Then you like honest bards will shine
Strong, bright, and clear.
TRICKETT V. HANLAN,
UR batsmen at the English wicket
Can proudly show a first-class ticket,
And even teach old England cricket?
Her special game;
And in aquatics Edward Trickett
Can do the same.
Outstripping England?s swiftest speed
Now Canada performs the deed,
But must our Austral oarsman heed
His rival?s arm ?
Not he I He tells his friends they need
Feel no alarm.
? Dominions? mighty fear nor quake,
Although their honour is at stake ;
Will tricky fortune him forsake
As champion known ?
And will another laurels take
Once all his own ?


He, in the grand November race,
Whom fate assigns the second place
Will surely merit no disgrace ;
For all allow
That unexampled is their pace?
Unknown till now.
Admiring Trickett?s matchless skill,
We like his courage better still;
And, meeting Hanlan, trust he will
Fresh triumphs gain,
And by astounding prowess thrill
The world again.
If loser in the risky game
We?ll praise his merit all the same;
But if he can bold Hanlan tame
Our Austral plains
Will shout with joy and sing his fame
In loudest strains.
HANLAN V_LAYGOCK.
NFIT for work and sadly overtrained
I M* I -Crt -IT kvla+al tt ATTArt nrA'
Our hero failed, completely overthrown,
And honours chief the young Canadian gained
Amidst such freaks, the wildest ever known.
But when the lustre of his comrade?s name
Paled in the blaze of Hanlan?s rising fame,
Our dauntless Laycock, anxious to retrieve
His country?s loss, fresh triumphs would achieve;
And he?the victor in aquatic fray,
When matched against the world?s assembled might?
Flush?d high with hot encounter, claims the right
To face the spoiler of the Austral sway.
A nation waits impatiently the time
For Laycock?s coup de grace in Britain?s wintry clime.
