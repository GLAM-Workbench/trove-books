A SOIL AND LAND-USE STUDY OF THE AUSTRALIAN TERRITORY
OF NORFOLK ISLAND, SOUTH PACIFIC OCEAN
By C. G. STEPHENS* and J. T. HUTTON*
(Manuscript received January 13, 1954)
I. INTRODUCTION
Following a request from His Honour the Administrator, Brigadier
H. B. Norman, a soil and land-use study of Norfolk Island, a Territory of
the Commonwealth of Australia in the South Pacific, was undertaken
during 1953. The necessary soil mapping, and associated field work were
done during July and the laboratory examination of the soil samples was
completed subsequently at the headquarters of the Division of Soils at
the Waite Agricultural Research Institute, Adelaide, S.A.
It is intended that this investigation, as well as providing a basis
foi experimental work and the rectification of land-use problems on
Norfolk Island, should exemplify what appear to be appropriate techniques
in the examination of such problems in other Pacific islands. To that
end this report was presented to the Eighth Pacific Science Congress held
in Quezon City, Philippine Islands, in November 1953.
Because of the lack of appropriately organized authorities dealing
constantly and in detail with technical, economic, social, and advisory
aspects of primary production on Norfolk Island, it has been found
necessary to discuss in some detail factors controlling land use normally
beyond the range of such an investigation as this, particularly when under-
taken on the mainland of Australia where State Departments of Agricul-
ture and other bodies would normally be concerned. As so many features
of a diverse character are interwoven with and govern present land use
on the island, any discussion which neglected them would be pointless,
especially as similar factors will certainly be involved in any future
attempts to put primary production on a generally sounder basis.
II. GENERAL
(a) Location and Size
Norfolk Island lies about 900 miles ENE. of Sydney on latitude
29° 3' 45" S. and longitude 167° 56' 29" E. It is a volcanic island about
8500 acres in area and one of a group of three islands in this locality.
Nepean Island, about half a mile to the south, is a limestone islet about
10 acies in extent, and Phillip Island, about three miles to the south, is a
very rugged and precipitous volcanic island less than two miles long and
narrower than one mile.

( b) Settlement, Population, and Administration
When discovered and named by Captain Cook in 1774, Norfolk Island
was uninhabited. A penal settlement was established there in 1788 but
was abandoned in 1813. The island, however, continued to be used by
whalers and warships until 1826, when it was again established as a penal
settlement, this phase lasting until 1855 when the penal settlement was
abandoned.
Following the mutiny of the Bounty in 1789 a few British sailors
and some Tahitian women fled to and settled on Pitcairn Island. Theii
descendants, however, grew too numerous for its small size and limited
resources and were transferred to Norfolk Island in 1856. This com-
munity numbered 194 persons and, except for 46 who returned to Pitcairn
Island in two groups in 1858 and 1863, it is from these and subsequent
settlers mainly from Australia and New Zealand that the piesent popula-
tion is derived. On June 30, 1951 the population was estimated as 1126.
Before 1913 Norfolk Island was under the jurisdiction of the State
of New South Wales but since that date it has been administered as a
Territory of the Commonwealth of Australia. An Administrator is
appointed by the Governor-General, who governs by Ordinances. An
elected Advisory Council advises the Administrator.
II I. GEOLOGYAND TOPOGRAPHY
Norfolk, Phillip, and Nepean Islands form a small group which com-
prises the only exposed land masses on the Norfolk Ridge (Marshall 1910,
Brodie 1952), a submarine elevation stretching from New Caledonia and
its attendant islands to New Zealand. Both Norfolk and Phillip Islands
are extinct remnants of volcanic cones which appear to have been paitly
destroyed by volcanic explosions and which certainly have been con-
siderably modified by weathering and stream dissection. A very small
portion of Norfolk Island at Kingston and all of Nepean Island directly
opposite are composed of calcarenite, a limestone formed of consolidated
current-bedded calcareous sand* in the lower beds of which water-worn
basalt boulders are embedded.
Carne (1885) reported on the chemical composition of the basalt,
tuff, and limestone, the latter containing in the specimen analysed over
95 per cent, of the carbonates of calcium and magnesium. Laing (1912)
and Speight (1912) also described the general physiography and the
nature of the rocks of the island.
* An examination of this calcarenite was made by M. F. Glaessner and Mary J.
Wade of the Geology Department of the University of Adelaide. They reported: “The
organic material consists of worn fragments of calcareous algae (Corallineae and a
few Halimeda), bryozoa, foraminifera ( Marginopora , Cibicules, Eponides, Amphi-
stegina, Sigmoidellu, Tviloculinu, etc.) and molluscan shell fragments. It is a shallow -
water deposit in which terrigenous material is represented only by a few well-rounded
grains of a weathered vesicular basaltic rock.”


Nepean Island is flat-topped and has an elevation of about 100 feet.
The exposure of the limestone at Kingston consists not only of an undulat-
Fig. 1.—Characteristic topography of the greater portion of Norfolk
Island. The gently sloping skyline 300-400 ft above sea-level indicates the

and Mt. Bates, which rise to just over 1000 ft.
ing surface up to 50 feet above sea-level, in places broken down to drifting
sand, but also of wave-cut platforms on the coastline and a reef sheltering

Emily Bay from the sea. Nearly all the streams of Norfolk Island enter
the sea by rapids and falls over the cliffs, on which there are elevated
c


benches and off which there are numerous sea stacks, some with rather
flat tops. All these features point to a significant elevation of the islands
in Pleistocene and Recent times.
Fig. 3.—The cliff face at Cascades on the north
coast, showing the alternate flows of basalt and
layers of tuff.
Uplift, dissection, and coastal erosion have resulted in Norfolk
Island’s being a virtually cliff-girt island with a general elevation of about
400 feet falling away to cliffs which undulate between 100 and 250 feet
above sea-level. In the north-west the interior of the island is dominated
by an abrupt fragment of the crater rim which in Mt. Pitt and Mt. Bates
rises to 1044 and 1028 feet respectively. Ball Bay on the east coast
appears to be the remains of a .subsidiary crater breached by the sea.
The island is drained by both permanent and seasonal streams which lie
in steeply to moderately graded beds located between interlocking spurs
(Fig. 1). These spurs, with slopes consistently convex and pitching
steeply, sometimes at an angle of 30°, into narrow, steep to moderately
Cl


graded stream courses, indicate a juvenile stage of dissection. With only
one exception the streams reach the sea either by falling precipitously
over the low points in the markedly undulating edge of the cliffs or by a
series of rapids and steeply sloping inclines. The exception is Watermill
Creek, which enters the sea near Kingston. This, in its lower course, is a
mature, gently-graded stream for about one mile characterized by a
significant accumulation of alluvial soils and swamps, and traverses the
limestone area for about one-third of that distance.
Fig. 4.—In most road-cuttings and near the tops of cliffs, characteristic
spheroidal weathering of the basalt is evident and occurs to considerable
depths.
The predominant rock is basalt, which, within its minor variations,
appears to be the essential parent material of the soils of the island.
However, in many places in the cliffs, particularly at Anson Bay and at
Cascades on the north coast, frequent exposures of tuff are found between
the various basalt flows (Figs. 2 and 3). In a few road-cuttings there
is also some evidence of this material as well as of old soil profiles covered
by subsequent lava flows. Because of the prevailing steep dissection it
must be presumed that the tuff has contributed somewhat to soil parent
materials, although this was never clearly evident in soil profile examina-
tion in pit excavations and auger borings, which most often ended in
obviously weathered basalt. The weathered basalt as seen in road-cuts
and cliff-tops has the characteristic spheroidal form (Fig. 4). It is possible
that the tuff is the intrinsic parent material of some of the soils of the


Steel’s Point, Duncombe Bay, and Rocky Point areas, which are less
dissected and have very deep profiles, with structure and consistence
qualities differing in a subtle way from the other soils of the island.
IV. VEGETATION AND FAUNA
The earliest descriptions of the native vegetation and the present-day
modified forest on the slopes of Mt. Pitt and Mt. Bates make it evident
that the island was originally clothed by a subtropical rain-forest
dominated by Norfolk Island pine ( Araucaria excelsa R.Br.), which grows
up to 100 feet taller than any other indigenous tree. Beneath the pine,
Lane-Poole (1926) listed the dominant forest components as follows:
ironwood ( Olea apetala Vahl.), maple ( Elaeodendron curtipendulum
Endl.), small yellow-wood ( Zanthoxylum blackburnia Benth.), big
yellow-wood ( Acronychia endlicheri Schott), whitewood ( Celtis
paniculata Planch.), bloodwood ( Baloghia lucida Endl.), Siah’s backbone
(Pseudomorus brunoniana Bur.), palm ( Rhopalostylis baueri H. Wendl.
& Drude), screw pine ( Freycinetia baueriana Endl.), tree ferns ( Alsophila
excelsa R.Br. and A. australis R.Br.), and tree lily ( Cordyline obtecta
J. G. Baker).
These support an array of lianas including species of Jasminum,
Melodinus, Ipomaea, Millettia, and Capparis. In addition, white oak
(Lagunaria patersoni G. Don) is quite common in the park-like grazing
and agricultural land where, with the pine, it forms a very attractive
artificial savannah woodland which unfortunately is much infested by
lantana ( Lantana camara L.), wild tobacco ( Solarium sp.), and Cape
tulip ( Homeria sp.).
Of the native fauna, sea birds may have been responsible for some
effect on soil, particularly near the coast. On the tops of the cliffs and
for a short distance inland the burrows of mutton-birds (sooty petrels,
Puffinus sp.) are quite common in some localities. It is just possible that
their breeding and feeding habits in burrows may be responsible for the
lack of differentiation of horizons in one of the soils mapped, the Selwyn
clay, which is found only adjacent to the cliff-tops.
There are no rabbits on Norfolk Island but they were liberated on
Phillip Island, which today, in striking contrast to Norfolk Island, bears
a highly colourful but extremely eroded and sterile aspect undoubtedly
caused by these rodents. There are numerous small field rats on Norfolk
Island.
V. CLIMATE
Climatic data for Norfolk Island are given in Table 1. The annual
average rainfall of over 50 inches is well distributed but has a marked
winter maximum. According to the criterion of Prescott, Collins, and
Shirpurkar (1952) (P > O.4PV- 75 ) it is effective for plant growth for all

12 months of the year. However, the mean data are somewhat misleading
as the annual rainfall has varied from about 33 inches to 77 inches with
corresponding variations in the monthly figures. Droughts of some weeks’
duration are not infrequent and are referred to in the early records of
the island.
However, on the whole the well-distributed and effective rainfall,
the moderate relative humidity, and the equable and mild temperatures
all provide a particularly favourable climatic environment for plants and
animals.
In only November, December, and January is rainfall on the average
less than the calculated potential evapotranspiration of moisture from
rain-forest cover ( E tr I.GEw 0 - 75 ) and for the year there is an excess
(52.89 40.85) of about 12 inches of moisture for run-off or transfer to
ground-water. Since under the soil and forest conditions of the island,
surface run-off is negligible, this water must normally pass through the
soil to the ground-water.
In only one month, November, is there on the average a deficit of
rainfall, and that a negligible one, for calculated potential evapotranspira-
tion of pasture ( E tr = 1.2 E w 0 For the year there is an excess of water
(52.89 30.61) of about 22 inches for run-off and transfer to ground-
water. Again because of soil and pasture conditions there is negligible
surface run-off, so practically all this moisture passes to the ground-water.
As indicated in Section VIII, this additional 10 inches of moisture passing
annually to the ground-water where the soil is under pasture as compared
to forest is a factor in the development of a form of soil erosion found
on steeply sloping sites on the grassland of the island.
VI. GROUND-WATER AND DRAINAGE
As might be expected from the climatic and topographical conditions,
springs are relatively common on Norfolk Island and are found at eleva-
tions ranging from near sea-level to about 400 feet. Water is also
commonly obtained in wells and bores situated not only in valley bottoms
but also on hill slopes and crests. These range from 20 to over 200 feet
in depth. From the information available and from an examination of
some available spoil they appear to be confined to weathered basalt and
tuff, thus confirming the evidence of the cliff-faces that weathering has
proceeded to considerable depths. The disposition of the springs and the
level of water in the wells considered in respect to the topography indicate
an irregular surface to the aquifer, which on the whole approaches the
land surface most commonly on and near the foot of steep slopes. Under
such topographical conditions the ground-water is a potent factor in the
development of a form of soil erosion discussed later.
Because of their highly structured condition and porous nature the
soils of the island may be considered to be, if anything, somewhat over


drained. However, occasionally near the foot of steep slopes and generally
near springs small areas of soil with drab but mottled and moist plastic
subsoils are encountered. It was not possible at the scale of working
to delineate these on the soil map.
Occasionally a swampy condition is found in the stream beds. This
is partly due to sections of their courses being of a flatter grade, and
partly to choking of the streams by beds of rushes, water hyacinth, and
other growth, and by fallen logs. The largest areas of such swamps are
on the lower mature course of Watermill Creek at Kingston and on the
lower middle course of the stream which drains the country north of
the aerodrome. In the latter case this represents stream maturity
inherited from the period prior to uplift, and at the present time the
stream is being regraded by vigorous headward erosion from where it is
incised in the cliffs, as are all the streams in some degree except Watermill
Creek.
VII. THE SOILE
(a) Soil Series and their Relationships
The soils mapped on Norfolk Island are listed in Table 2, which
shows their classification in terms of great soil groups, their topographic
and drainage relationships, and their parent materials.
( b) The Soil Map
The occurrence and morphological features of the different soils are
described below. Reference is also made to analytical data of agronomic
significance for each soil. The colours of all soils are described for the
moist state and the coordinates given refer to the Munsell* system of
notation. The boundaries of all horizons of all profiles are diffuse. The
boundaries between soil types are likewise ill defined and therefore difficult
to locate with any real precision. However, there is a strong correlation
with topography, and they have been interpolated between observed points
by stereoscopic interpretation of aerial photographs. The diffuse nature
of the soil boundaries and the limits of the technique of mapping employed
should be borne in mind when using the soil map in the field.
(c) Morphological, Chemical, and Physical Characteristics of the Soils
(i) Palm Glen Clay. —This soil is located on the upper and middle
slopes of Mt. Pitt and Mt. Bates and along Stockyard Road to the north-
west of Ball Bay. It lies on moderate to steep slopes and for the most
part is still under forest, being generally regarded as an inferior soil.
It is easily recognized by the rather striking red colour of the profile,
which has the following morphological features.

The surface soil consists of a dark red (2.5YR4/4), friable clay
with organic matter and a pronounced granular to crumb structure. At
less than 12 inches depth this is underlain by a deep subsoil of red
(10R 4/5-4/6), somewhat compact but friable, granular clay in which
decomposing basalt appears at a depth of about 60 inches and increases
in quantity with depth.
Tables 3 and 4 give the results of laboratory examination of samples
from a pit at sample site No. 5 (see map). The relatively low agricultural
reputation of the Palm Glen clay is probably connected with the small
amount of exchangeable calcium in the surface soil and the low pH values
of the subsoil horizons.

(ii) Mt. Pitt Clay. —This chocolate-coloured soil is located on the
middle and lower gentle to moderate slopes of Mt. Pitt and Mt. Bates and
north of Ball Bay. Generally it has been cleared for pasture and is also
used for horticultural purposes. It is regarded as a moderately good soil.
The chocolate colour of the profile makes it rather easy to identify, as
shown in the following morphological description.
The surface soil consists of about 12 inches of dark red-brown
(2.5YR3/3), friable clay containing organic matter and with a nutty
structure. This passes into a deep, friable clay, red-brown (2.5YR4/4)
in colour and with a granular structure. At about 48 inches slight cherty
material occurs in the profile and this is followed by increasing amounts
of decomposing basalt.
Laboratory examination of some of the samples taken from site
No. 4 gave the results in Tables 5 and 6. The better results from
the Mt. Pitt clay as compared with the Palm Glen clay are probably
correlated with the higher value for exchangeable calcium and the generally
higher pH values throughout the profile.

(iii) Rooty Hill Clay. —This soil occurs most intensively on the
dissected slopes and spurs of the eastern and central part of the island.
It is also found wherever the streams cut deeply into the land in the
vicinity of the cliffs. The slopes on which it occurs are characteristically
convex and frequently approach angles of 30°. It is largely under pasture,
being generally too steep to cultivate except on ridge-tops, and is subject
to slumping on the steeper slopes. Except for the shallow stony skeletal
soil on basalt it is the shallowest of the soils formed on volcanic material,
being commonly less than three feet deep to the weathered basalt. Its
morphology is given below.
The surface soil is a dark brown (7.5YR-10YR 3/2), friable, nutty
to granular clay generally less than 12 inches deep. It rests on a subsoil
of red-brown (SYR4/5), friable, granular to crumb-structured clay
generally with cherty material in the lower portion. At depths ranging
up to four feet weathered basalt appears and rapidly increases with depth.
Samples were collected from two sites (Nos. 1 and 8) of Rooty Hill
clay, and Tables 7 and 8 give the results of laboratory examinations.
From these data it will be seen that Rooty Hill clay is intermediate in
character between Palm Glen and Mt. Pitt clays.
(iv) Steel’s Point Clay. —This soil, regarded as the most fertile arable
soil on Norfolk Island, occurs most extensively near Steel’s Point, not so
extensively near Duncombe Bay, and in a broken area near Rocky Point
where there is also rather more variation in soil profile features. It

occupies nearly flat to gently undulating sites and is favoured for all
horticultural crops, especially bean seed production. It is an attractive
dark-coloured soil with deep penetration of organic matter. The charac-
teristic profile morphology is given below.
The surface soil is a dark brown (10YR3/2), friable, crumb- to
granular-structured clay with organic matter; it gradually changes to a
dark yellow-brown colour (10YR-7.5YR 4/3) with depth. At about 30
inches there is a gradual change to a reddish to yellowish brown
(SYR 4/5-7.5YR 5/5), friable, indefinite crumb- to granular-structured
clay. From about 60 inches the soil has the appearance of being a C or
weathering horizon, but no obviously weathering basalt was encountered,
whence it is suspected that the parent material of the soil is the tuff
to be seen in several places along the cliffs.
Laboratory data (Tables 9 and 10) are available for two profiles
sampled at sites Nos. 3 and 6 and confirm the fertile nature of the soil.
This favoured soil is characterized by significantly higher exchangeable
calcium and higher pH values. Phosphorus, at 0.8 per cent., is remarkably
high.
(v) Middlegate Clay. —This soil occupies the least dissected central
portion of the island in the Middlegate and Burnt Pine areas. It occurs
on gently sloping to flat sites on what appear to be remnants of an
elevated tableland. This topographic position and the occurrence of fine

pisolitic ironstone gravel in the surface horizons of the soil indicate
a probably greater age and degree of maturity for this soil than for other
soils of the island. Because of its favourable topography it was almost
certainly the principal soil cultivated in the times of the penal settlements,
but its fertility is regarded as low by present landowners, who largely
use it for pastures. However, where mixed fertilizers are used, horticul-
tural crops are quite successfully grown. The morphology of its profile
is given below.
The surface soil is a nearly black (2.5Y-10YR 3/1), friable, nutty
clay containing slight to moderate amounts of a fine, rounded, ironstone
gravel which increases with depth to about 10 inches. Below is a red-
brown (SYR 4/4), friable, crumb-structured clay to a depth of about
24 inches, below which a darker red-brown (SYR 3/2-3/4), friable,
crumb-structured clay occurs with some cherty material in the lower
portion. This persists to depths of about 50 inches, below which
weathered basalt increasingly occurs.
The greater age of this soil is reflected in the results of the laboratory
examination of samples from site No. 2 (Tables 11 and 12). Exchangeable
calcium is low and the profile is significantly acid in reaction in both the
surface soil and the subsoil. Phosphorus is also lower than in the other
soils.
(vi) Selwyn Clay. —This soil is found on gently undulating areas on
the top of the cliffs on the west coast of the island. It is not extensive
and persists for only a few chains inland. There is an association of
sooty petrel burrows with this soil and the birds’ habits in burrows may

be responsible for the remarkably uniform and dark colour of the whole
profile of this soil. It is regarded as a very fertile soil but occurs in
rather badly exposed situations. The morphology of the profile is given
below.
The whole profile to the C horizon is a dark brown (7.5YR3/2),
friable clay, nutty to granular in structure for a depth of about 20 inches,
then becoming indefinite crumb-structured. At about 60 inches slight
decomposing basalt occurs and increases with depth. Some cherty material
also occurs deep in the profile.
The laboratory results on the samples collected at site No. 7 (Tables
13 and 14) show the fertile nature of the soil and the greater accession
of water-soluble salts from the sea. The high fertility is reflected in the
very large figure for phosphorus, the relatively high exchangeable calcium,
and the uniform neutral reaction throughout the profile.
(vii) Emily Bay Calcareous Sand. —This soil, confined to the Kingston
area, has an undulating, stony landscape and is very variable in depth.
In two places the surface has become broken and sand drift has ensued.
The rest of the soil is covered by pasture and is largely occupied by the
common. The soil has the following morphology in its deeper phase.
The surface soil about three inches deep is a speckled dark brown
(SYR3/2) sandy loam with much organic matter. Below is a similarly
speckled brownish yellow (10YR7/4) sand. Both horizons are highly
calcareous and the profile, of very variable depth, rests on calcarenite.
Laboratory examination of this soil from site No. 9 shows that the
subsoil (3-42 in.) has only 3 per cent, of material insoluble in acid. The
surface is rich in organic matter (0.68 per cent, total nitrogen) and has
16 per cent, of acid-insoluble material, mainly clay.


(viii) Unnamed Shallow Stony Soils. —On many of the very steep
slopes of the island, shallow soils with basalt stones close to and in the
surface soil occur. They are generally dark brown in colour and occur
most extensively on the upper portion of Mt. Pitt and Mt. Bates and on
their northern slopes, but also in minor areas in other parts of the island.
(ix) Unnamed Alluvial and Swamp Soils. —In some of the valleys,
particularly in the lower part of Watermill Creek, some alluvium of
basaltic origin has been deposited. For the most part drainage is
unrestricted and there has been no significant profile differentiation, the
soils being dark in colour and a friable clay in texture. However, in
places where drainage is restricted, swamps with heavy-textured organic
soils have developed.
No samples of the last two soils were collected, hence no laboratory
data are available.
(d) Soil Fertility—General
The high total-nitrogen values for all surface soils are noteworthy
and there is a remarkably consistent carbon: nitrogen- ratio of about
10 to 1. However, these data do not exclude the possibility of temporary
deficiency of available nitrogen. The excess of rainfall, particularly in
the winter months as shown in Table 1, must be responsible at times for
considerable losses of nitrate nitrogen.
It is doubtful if those soils with pH values greater than 6.5 in the
surface horizons would respond to lime. However, experiments are
justified on the Palm Glen, Rooty Hill, and Middlegate soils.
The position with regard to potassium and magnesium is obscure
on all soils and can be clarified only by a series of plot experiments.
Phosphorus varies greatly up to very high values but its availability
in krasnozem soils is always a matter of uncertainty. A comprehensive
series of experiments to test this for Norfolk Island soils, some of which
are apparently unique, is required.
The status of the soils with respect to trace elements is quite obscure.
There is some evidence from both plants and animals that there may be
incipient deficiencies and this needs checking by suitably designed field
experiments.
A small-scale and unreplicated observational trial laid down on Rooty
Hill clay late in July already shows some evidence of responses to phos-
phorus and sulphur, which elements although present in considerable
quantities may not be readily available owing to the high content of
organic matter. The use of a molybdenum salt on portion of a crop of
beans is also reported to show beneficial effects.


VIII. SOIL EROSION
At various places on the island, but most commonly on the steep
slopes behind Kingston, there occurs a particular form of soil erosion
characterized in the final stages by soil slumping. The initial and complete
forms in the development of this damage are shown in Figures 5 and 6.
Fig. 5.—Critically poised soil on a hillside above Watermill Creek. The
fence crossing the toe of the spur leans outward and the large bush nearby
marks the site of a spring at the foot of the slope.
Figure 5 illustrates the characteristic “cat-step” formation due to a
combination of soil creep and stock padding. Circumstances which con-
tribute to this phenomenon are: (1) The soil is at its critical angle of
rest under pasture cover as opposed to its former stable condition under
rain-forest. (2) Ground-water is sufficiently close to the surface in some
localities to assist slipping, particularly after prolonged soaking rains.
The damage is caused by man’s disturbance of a natural equilibrium
established between soil, slope, vegetation, rainfall, and ground-water.
Under natural rain-forest cover, the soils which rest somewhat
precariously on the steep slopes have a stability due not only to the deep
binding effect of the tree roots but also to the minimal accession of
moisture to the ground-water. This small addition results from a marked
interception of rain by the forest canopy and ground litter and from the
removal of water from both the soil and the deeply weathered zone beneath
by forest transpiration.


Under pastures of introduced species the root-binding effect is reduced
to a shallower depth and the roots are weaker. There is also, as shown
in Table 1, a reduction in the interception of rain and a decline in the
transpiration of deeper soil moisture. Since infiltration on these very
permeable soils is high, more water thus reaches the deeper soil and
weathered zone. Where the ground-water is sufficiently close the additional
moisture saturates the soil mass lying at its critical angle of rest on the
steeper slopes. The lubricated soil, being free of strong reinforcing roots,
slumps down the hillside.
Grazing animals may be of some consequence in the development of
this phenomenon. As the soil starts to slip and wrinkle on the steep
slopes they take advantage of the improved foothold to form pads which
accentuate the wrinkles into a terrace-like form. Where previously there
may have been some run-off this reduces or eliminates it and, by increasing
infiltration, accentuates the phenomenon.
Fig. 6.—Final stage in the development of soil erosion due to soil creep
and slumping on steep, convex slopes. A dense pasture sward is not
effective in preventing this form of erosion where soil lies at its critical
angle of rest. Reclamation and stabilization of such sites by planting back
to Norfolk Island pine forest is clearly indicated.
However, overgrazing to increase run-off and reduce infiltration is
not a desirable method of control as inevitably sheet and gully erosion
would result. Control obviously lies in the return of both incipiently and
seriously affected areas to forest. Fencing eroded sites and planting to
Norfolk Island pine, which is so easy to establish even in very steep and
rough situations, is a practical measure and easily carried out. Because
of the ultimate value of the timber it is also possibly an economic procedure


in harmony with the forest policy already proposed for the island by
Lane-Poole (1926), Cromer (1949), and Hall (unpublished data).
As indicated above, the erosion is most prevalent on the slopes above
Kingston and, in addition to loss of soil, there will certainly be a repetition
of the damage done on past occasions to buildings and roads, and an
accumulation of earth behind the walls of the administration offices and
other structures, unless control measures are adopted.
IX. LAND USE
(a) The General State of Primary Production
Despite favourable soil and climatic conditions, primary production
on Norfolk Island is in a depressed and uneconomic state. The reasons
for this are numerous—some non-agricultural—and rather involved.
Previous investigations of different aspects of primary production have
been made and have resulted in factual and valuable reports by McDonald
(1935) on general agricultural conditions, by Savage (1935) and Barnard
(1949) on horticulture, by Wilson (1952) on bean seed production, by
Kent (1952) on the incidence of tuberculosis and other diseases amongst
cattle, and by Lane-Poole (1926), Cromer (1949), and Hall (unpublished
data) on forestry. These reports deal in detail with the shortcomings
and potentialities of each industry and some of them recognize the opera-
tion of non-agricultural factors in curtailing the potential productivity of
the island. An attempt is made below to show the dependence of primary
production on all the factors concerned.
(h) Early Settlement and Land Tenure
The early penal settlements were responsible for the initial develop-
ment of agriculture on the island. During one period approximately 3000
soldiers and convicts were there and a considerable area of land was
cleared, particularly in the eastern and central portions. Twelve hundred
acres were under cultivation and amongst other crops wheat was grown
and milled on the island. Cattle, sheep, and pigs were kept and at the
end of 1843 reached a total of about 6000 head, the great majority being
sheep.
Following the complete evacuation of the penal colony in 1855, the
settlement by the Pitcairn islanders in 1856 was founded on the land
already cleared and cultivated and the livestock left behind. Each family
was granted an area of 40-50 acres, the remainder of the island being
retained by the Crown. Since then, with increasing population, the land
grants have been repeatedly subdivided until now a large number of them
are long, narrow tracts of only a few acres, many of which cannot be
used efficiently as units. The Crown land, except the forest reserves
around Mt. Pitt and at places on the coast, has been issued to subsequent
settlers on a leasehold basis.


(c) Pastures and Livestock
Pastures are dominated by paspalum, kikuyu, buffalo, and couch
grasses and have a variable but generally minor amount of clover. The
weakness of the clover may be due in part at least to the lack of phosphate
fertilizer, which freight and handling charges raise to a prohibitive price
level, about three times that in Australia. Carrying capacity of the
pastures is particularly difficult to estimate because of lack of systematic
grazing management and because of the 12-month growing season, which
produces a green pasture even when overgrazed. Without phosphate the
capacity under good topographic conditions and without noxious plants is
probably equivalent to 2-3 dry sheep to the acre.
The productivity of the pastures is seriously reduced and sometimes
almost eliminated by the prevalence of lantana, tobacco bush, and Cape
tulip, which have been generally allowed to get out of hand. Because of
the small size of the properties the eradication of the first two by hand or
mechanical means is not impracticable, and there are now known methods
of pasture establishment and management (Walker and Trumble, personal
communication) which give some control of Cape tulip.
The last livestock census showed an aggregate of about 2500 horses,
cattle, sheep, and pigs, and of this number approximately 1000 were horses,
mostly unused. These have contributed largely to the overgrazing of
pastures and many animals are now being destroyed. A large proportion
of the sheep and cattle, especially in the Kingston and Ball Bay areas, are
in very poor condition. The report by Kent (1952) on the livestock
industry shows that there is no undue incidence of bovine tuberculosis,
but points to the probable incidence of deficiency diseases. Some of the
sheep show broken wool, poor tucked-up condition, and scouring even on
short pastures, and there are occasional deaths. Bone chewing by cattle
and other evidence of depraved appetite is common. These symptoms
suggest the possibility of coast disease, copper and/or cobalt deficiency,
or phosphorus deficiency.
At the present time both meat and dairy products are produced in
insufficient quantity for the requirements of the island’s population, and a
butter factory operated until 1950 has been closed and dismantled. For
this situation to be rectified there needs to be a concerted policy of
pasture improvement and management, livestock husbandry, fodder con-
servation, and, if possible, the production of protein concentrates for
supplementary feeding of dairy cows. It is certain that areas of at
least 70 acres of topographically suitable land are required for the
efficient operation of worth-while dairy units, and phosphate fertilizers
also may be highly desirable.
( d ) Horticulture
During the past 30 years attempts have been made to develop horticul-
ture as a major export enterprise. Although citrus, bananas, passion-fruit,


guavas, and other fruit, and coffee and other products can be grown with
ease, difficulties with transport, plant diseases, plant quarantine and
health regulations, unreliable markets, and lack of technical skills have
precluded any prolonged period of success with these fruits or their
canned products. At the present time a small-scale but worth-while
sea-borne trade in bean seed, palm seed, and citrus seed for tree stocks,
and in air-freighted flowers, avocado pears, and a small quantity of peas
and beans is all that is left of export horticulture. It is notable that these
are either relatively non-perishable products capable of awaiting sea
transport or high-value though perishable products suitable for air trans-
port. However, the income from these products is woefully small in view
of the potential productivity of the island, and is clearly reflected in the
very adverse trade balance of the island shown in the Commonwealth
Yearbook (Commonwealth of Australia 1953).
As well as the fruit mentioned above, now surplus for island needs,
there is sufficient production of vegetables to meet local requirements.
Potatoes, kumeras, peas, beans, carrots, etc. grow well but occasionally
nitrogen deficiency symptoms can be seen in the non-legumes.
( e ) Forestry
From the early years of the penal settlements Norfolk Island pine
was extensively exploited both for local use and for export markets.
This overcutting quickly led to the depletion of the commercial forest
and now necessitates a period of reafforestation to regain a sustained
yield basis in production and utilization. The reports on the forest needs
of the island referred to in Section IX (a) have clearly laid down such a
plan involving not only the indigenous pine but also species of Eucalyptus
and Pinus. There should be no obstacle whatever to the implementing of
this .plan, as it is entirely a matter for action by the Administration and
does not involve any large portion of the island otherwise suitable for
agriculture; rather, in fact, should forestry be extended if possible to the
steeper slopes of the grazing land, to minimize soil erosion there as
described in Section VIII.
The seed of Norfolk Island pine is collected in the intermittent good
seed years and together with the seed of Lord Howe Island palm (Kentia
belmoreana Bacc.), which grows well on the island, constitutes a small
export product.
(/) Fertilizers
The supply and use of fertilizers on Norfolk Island are entirely
unsatisfactory. Even if their use had been properly assessed, supply
would still present a major problem because of the great additional cost
of transport and freight.


Beyond some experience with a mixed NPK fertilizer on beans and
other garden crops there has been no systematic assessment of the fertilizer
requirements of the different soils and crops of the island. There is,
therefore, urgent need of fertilizer trials on both pastures and vegetables
with phosphorus, calcium, nitrogen, potassium, magnesium, sulphur, and
the trace elements, and of a trial with phosphorus, calcium, copper, and
cobalt on livestock.
Normally lime is required by krasnozem soils, but pH values shown
by field tests and in the laboratory suggest that in some of the soils
adequate exchangeable calcium may be present. Proximity to the sea and
a high accession of oceanic salt may be responsible for this. The analytical
data indicate the concentration of metal ions generally in the surface soil
by organic matter accumulation.
The obvious requirement of phosphorus merits special attention to
the most suitable form of fertilizer. Triple superphosphate would have
great advantages over ordinary superphosphate because of the trebling
effect of freights on costs as compared with those on the Australian main-
land. Some form of concentrated phosphatic fertilizer would greatly
mitigate this impost. If such a fertilizer cannot be made readily in
Australia it may pay to import up to 200 tons annually and tranship
in Sydney for Norfolk Island.
(g) Transport and Market Limitations
As indicated above, definite limitations on production for export are
imposed by the infrequent and irregular shipping service to the island.
Further, heavy freight and handling costs not only treble the costs of
fertilizers but impose similar burdens to some degree on all forms of trade
connected with agriculture, whether it is the export of products or the
importing of agricultural machinery. Because of the small size of the
island, its isolation, and the need for shipping services to touch at other
places it would be unrealistic to expect an improvement in shipping-
services.
Air freight to Australia and New Zealand provides some release from
the restrictions imposed by the shipping service on perishable products,
but for air freight such products must be valuable, e.g. flowers, avocado
pears, and out-of-season vegetables such as peas and beans.
Markets for fresh fruit such as oranges and bananas are not
necessarily available in Australia and New Zealand, as in both cases the
requirements of plant health regulations have to be met, and in New
Zealand the market may be subject to trade barriers. In Australia local
oranges and bananas have great advantages in pi to the mai ket,
frequent transport facilities, and large-scale organization.


(h) Social Limitations
Norfolk Island agriculture suffers from a lack of skilled extension
work amongst a rural population of rather unusual characteristics. The
people, of mixed English and Tahitian stock, have become somewhat
disillusioned and bewildered by the outcome of their ventures in export
agriculture. This has led to an acceptance of subsistence agriculture
which makes little use of the real potentialities of the island. Earlier
reports mention the indolent attitude of the islanders in deprecatory
terms but their interest in all new ventures and better than average results
lead one to believe that higher standards of education, to secondary and
tertiary levels where appropriate, will provide the community not only
with capable leaders but also with an incentive to attain higher living
standards. In the meantime skilled technical extension work in all aspects
of agriculture is required. This can be met only by the appointment of
an officer for at least five years. Primarily he should devote himself to
experimental and advisory work.
( i) Recommendations
(1) The appointment of an agricultural experimental and advisory
officer with the highest possible qualifications.
(2) A comprehensive set of fertilizer trials and animal nutrition
experiments to be carried out.
(3) Implementation of the forest policy already recommended and
its extension to control erosion on active and vulnerable sites.
(4) Agricultural production to be raised to meet all the food needs
of the island except for wheat and flour and similar products.
(5) Investigation of coffee production, which the changed market
situation should greatly favour.
<6) Clearing of noxious weeds and thinning out of hedges, which
are frequently too close and too thick for the small fields they shelter.
(7) Full use to be made of the obvious advantages of the island in
climate and scenic attractions as a health and holiday resort. Tourists
to be increased from 1000 to 5000-10,000 a year and the production of
the island raised commensurably. This implies a policy of bringing people
to the food rather than sending food to the people.
