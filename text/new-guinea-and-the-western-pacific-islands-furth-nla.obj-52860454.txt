Enclosure 1 in No. 1.
My Lord, Paris, October 24, 1884.
I have the honour to inform you that the debate on the first reading of the
“ Recidivistes ” Bill began in the Senate yesterday.
It may be well to observe that, in conformity with the French Parliamentary proce-
dure, the text before the Senate is that of the amended Bill, proposed by its own
Committee, which differs in many points from that of the Bill sent up from the Chamber
of Deputies.
The two texts are printed in parallel columns, pages 53 to G 5 of the Report of the
Committee, copies of which were transmitted to your Lordship with Sir J. Walsham’s
Despatch of the 9th instant.
In the debate yesterday two speeches were made ; one by M. Bereuger, in opposition
to the Bill, and the other by M. Waldeck Rousseau, the Minister of the Interior, who
originated the measure in the Chamber of Deputies before he was in office, and has in
office as well as out of office been a warm supporter of it.
In the course of his speech M, W. Rousseau dwelt upon the advantage which the
Colony of New Caledonia would, he conceived, derive from the relegation to it of a
certain class and a certain number of Recidivistes ; he wound up his statement on this
point with the following words : “ On comprend que la transportation individuelle, c’est-
“ a-dire I’envoi dans la colonie de condamnes dont I’administration, pendant la periode de
“ detention, aura verifie les aptitudes; I’envoi de relegues de recidivistes appartenant a
“ certains professions et correspondant a un besoin de main-d’oeuvre dans la colonie,
“ ne peut Ctre qu’un instrument de progrbs pour la colonie, un moyen d’accroitre ses
“ richesses et sa prospCrite.”
On the other hand M. W. Rousseau enlarged upon the advantages of French Guiana
as a place to which to transport “ Recidivistes ” in general, and disputed the correctness
of the general impressions as to the unhealthiness of that Colony.
He argued that the Senate should first of all decide the question whether the transpor-
tation of the recidivistes is clearly and indisputably required (“ la relegation des recidi-
vistes s’imposent-elle avec evidence, d’une fa§on includable ?”).
This being decided in the affirmative it would then, he maintained, remain for the
Senate to determine whether it should be left to the Government to fix the places to
which the “ RCcidivistes ” should be transported, and the details of the regulations to be
applied to them. At the end of M. W. Rousseau’s speech the debate was adjourned till
the following day (to-day).

Mv Lord, Paris, October 25, 1884.
With reference to my Despatch of yesterday, I have the honour to forward
to your Lordship herewith the report* published this morning in the “ Journal Officiel ”
of the second day’s (yesterday’s) debate in the Senate. on the first reading of the
“ Recidiviste Bill.” The day’s debate was opened by a fresh speech from M. Berenger,
in which he replied to the speech made the day before by M. Waldeck Rousseau, the
Minister of the Interior. He disputed the. accuracy of the estimate made by the
Minister of the number of Ilecidivistes who would be liable to transportation.
He observed that the Minister had declared that there were only two Colonies to whom
Recidivistes could be relegated, viz., New Caledonia and French Guyana.
As regards New Caledonia he said that the Minister proposed indeed to send only a
small proportion, a fifth in fact, to that Colony, but that the Governor had reported that
the Colony could not receive one, not a single one.
He affirmed, in contradiction to the Minister, that French Guyana, to which the mass
would thus be sent, was in truth extremely unhealthy.
To defend himself against the charge of being insensible to the importance of the
“Recidiviste” question, he adverted to the Bill to prevent “ Recidivisme ” which he
had himself brought into the Senate.
He objected to the Government Bill in principle and in detail. An account of
M. Berenger’s Bill was given in my Despatch to your Lordship of 22nd March last.
M. de Verninac, the reporter of the Committee, replied to M. Berenger.
M. Schoelcher, who, before his election as a life Senator by the National Assembly,
had been deputy for French Guyana, protested in the name of the Colony against its
being made a place of transportation for Recidivistes, and read a resolution of the Conseil
General deprecating in the strongest terms such a measure.
M, Felix Faure, Under Secretary of State in the Department of Marine and Colonies,
maintained the correctness of the estimate of the Minister of Interior of the number of
Recidivistes to be transported, that is to say, 5,000 the first year, 4,000 the second year,
3,000 the third year. He denied the unhealthiness of French Guyana.
Admiral Fourichon, who had been Governor of French Guyana, maintained that
Europeans cannot perform agricultural work in that Colony without fatal consequences
to their health. He objected altogether to the transportation of criminals.
After a speech from M. Milhat Fontarabie, Deputy for the Island of Reunion, the
debate was adjourned to the following day (to-day).

Enclosure in No. 2. / /
My Lord, Paris, October 27, 1884.
With reference to my Despatch of 25th instant, I have the honour to inform your
Lordship that the Recidivistes Bill, as proposed by the Senate Committee, was adopted
on the first reading by that body the day before yesterday.
It was, however, expressly stated that Senators reserved to themselves full liberty of
action with regard to the principle as well as the details of the Bill when it should come-
up for the second reading.
I have the honour to enclose the authentic report* of the proceedings.
The day’s debate was opened by Admiral Jaureguiberry, who confirmed the statements
of Admiral Fourichon with regard to the unhealthiness of French Guyana. He said,
however, that New Caledonia might receive in course of time about 2,000 Recidivistes,
provided care was taken to select masons, carpenters, locksmiths, wheelwrights, in short,
the skilled workmen who were wanting in the Colony. He adverted to the system in
force in New Caledonia of obtaining labourers from the New Hebrides, who, he said,
were nothing more than slaves under another name; with regard to suggestions which
had been made on the subject of sending Recidivistes to the New Hebrides, the Admiral
observed, in the first place, that there were international arrangements which would
prevent the annexation of those islands, and, in the second place, that they were
unhealthy, and that in many of them drinking water was scarce.
Admiral Jaureguiberry objected to the arbitrary power left to the Executive Autho-
rities on some points, and in particular to the discretion given to them by the 13th
Article with regard to allowing Recidivistes to quit the Colony temporarily.
He moreover called upon the Government to give the Senate information as to the
regime to which the transported Recidivistes were to be subjected, and which according
to the Bill was to be establishedjby executive decree. These relegated Recidivistes will,
he said, according to the declarations made in the Chamber of Deputies, be free. In
fact they cannot be confined as prisoners; law and right forbid it; “a quel regime
seront-ils soumis? Nous n’en savons rien.”
The Baron de Lareinty maintained that Recidivistes in French Guyana would not be
exposed to greater danger, as regarded their health, than had been incurred by the first
French settlers in that country.
After a speech by M. Yerninac, the reporter of the Committee, in answer to Admiral
Jaureguiberry, the general debate was closed, and the articles were put one by one.
The Ist Article is that by which transportation or “relegation” (to adopt the
euphemism of the Chamber of Deputies) is established in principle. It was carried
by 141 votes to 38.
The other Articles as proposed by the Committee were then adopted, reservations
being made as to their being liable to amendment or rejection on the second reading.

I observed to him that the Bill as it stood left it entirely to the discretion of the
Executive Government to determine to what places “ recidivistes ” should be relegated,
and that I could not but hope that after all the representations and remonstrances which J
had made to him on the part of Her Majesty’s Government and on behalf of Her
Majesty’s Australasian Colonies, none of these criminals would be sent to the Western
Pacific Islands. M. Jules Ferry said that I must have perceived from the debate that it
was to French Guyana, as a place for deportation, that the thoughts of the French
Government were principally directed. He did not give me any more definite assurance.
As your Lordship is aware, the Bill is not unlikely to be altered in some particulars
by the Senate on the second reading.

With reference to my Despatches of the 25th and 29th ult., 1 have the
honour to report that, on the second reading of the “ Recidivistes ” Bill coming up on
the order of the day in the Senate yesterday, it was postponed at the request of M. de
Verninac, the reporter.
M. de Verninac said that the documents for which the Committee had applied to the
Minister of Marine had only just reached them, while those for which they had applied
to the Minister of Justice had not yet been received. He added that they had the day
before taken the evidence of M. Pallu de la Barrihre, Governor of New Caledonia, and
that on the following day they were to take that of the present Governor of French
Guyana.
Finally, he assured the Senate that the Committee regretted the postponement, but
that it would not be long, and that they would themselves ask the House to take up the
Bill in a short time.

Enclosure in No. 5. '
My Lord, Paris, January 3, 1885.
With reference to my Despatch of the 14th November last, I have the
honour to transmit herewith to your Lordship two copies of a supplementary report,*
which was laid on the table of the Senate on the 15th ult. by M. de Yerninac, on behalf
of the Committee on the Recidivistes Bill.
The first section (pages 3 to 7) relates to the question as to the places to which recidi-
vistes shall be transported. The Committee propose that it shall be left to the
Government to fix upon these places. We exclude (they say) no place, not Guyana,
notwithstanding the serious objections made to it; nor do we affirm that notwithstanding
the difficulties arising from the presence of 7,000 convicts and of 3,000 freed convicts
without work in New Caledonia, it will not be possible, especially if the working of mines
should make a fresh start, to turn a certain number of transported recidivistes to good
account in that Colony.
The second section (pages 8 to 11) deals with the system of treatment to be adopted
towards the recidivistes in the places to which they are transported. It begins by men-
tioning the strong repugnance to receiving recidivistes manifested by the French colonies.
It attributes this repugnance mainly to the defects in the system applied with regard to
the convicts who are now transported to these colonies. What, the Committee asks,
becomes of the freed convicts, obliged in virtue of the law of 1854, to reside temporarily
or permanently in the Colony ? they are for the most part without work, they become a
burden to the State or to the Colony, and being no longer submitted to any discipline,
they' are a cause of disturbance and demoralization to the Colonists among whom they
live. We believe, the Committee say, in the usefulness of penal transportation, and in the
possibility of making it advantageous to the Colonies, but we call the attention of the
Government to the necessity of making reforms in the penitentiary system in the
Colonies, and especially in the position of the freed convicts. By the law which the
Committee recommend, it is left to the Executive Government to determine by decree
the measures of police and supervision to which the transported recidivistes are to be
subjected.
Section JY. of the Report (pages 12 to 17) contains an estimate of the number of the
recidivistes to whom the law would apply.
Section VIII, (pages 28 to 34) explains, article by article, the changes proposed by
the Committee in the Bill as passed by the Senate on the first reading.
Pages 35 to 44 contain in parallel columns the Bill passed by the Chamber of Deputies,
the Bill adopted by the Senate on the first reading, and the Bill now proposed by the
Committee.
Among the annexes will be found :
Evidence given by Captain Pallu de la Barriere, formerly Governor of New Caledonia
(page 47).
Evidence of Messrs. Schulcher and Richaux concerning protests of the Conseils
Generaux of Guyana and New Caledonia against the transportation of recidivistes to
those Colonies (page 53).
Evidence of various kinds relative to the question of the unhealthiness of Guyana
(pages 57 to 91).
Suggestion by M. Chesse, Governor of Guyana, respecting the conditions as to
treatment and other matters, under which, in his opinion, recidivistes might with advantage
be transported to that Colony (page 92).
The session of the Chambers was closed on the 29th ult., without the second reading
of the recidivistes Bill having come on in the Senate, but it will probably come on next
Session. According to the French parliamentary practice the close of the Session does
not cancel the previous proceedings respecting Bills in either Chamber. The Bills
are taken up in the next Session at the stage at which they had arrived in the Session
before.

6th February 1885. My Government has submitted to me a Memorandum, the
general purport of which they are desirous I should telegraph your Lordship. My
Government having conferred with Major-General Scratchley learns for first time the
Colonies expected to pay total expenses of Protectorate; this ray Government consider
contrary to tenour of your Lordship’s Despatch 9th May ;* this Government would
last season have been ready to contribute the double amount requested, but present
proposal suggests unknown responsibility without giving to Colonies control over
expenditure. This appears to Government unfair; the duties, moreover, which
Scratchley will have to perform as Commissioner and Deputy embrace those of an
Imperial character, and Government consider that Her Majesty’s Government should
consequently take share in the cost.

They urgently desire information as to extent of territory annexed or Protectorate,
what arrangements for exercise of jurisdiction, function of Special Commissioner, and
what way would administer the Government, After receipt of such information decision
of this Government as to increase of contribution will be announced. Ministers wish
me further to state that, while they trust they may, on the grounds of the Imperial
interests involved, rely with confidence on Her Majesty’s Government contributing
towards the cost attending annexation or protectorate, Victoria will not allow any mere
monetary consideration to stand in the way of conserving the future interests of
Australasia in this matter.

GOVERNOR THE GIGHT HON. LORD AUGUSTUS LOFTUS, G.C.B. (NEW SOUTH
WALES), TO THE RIGHT HON. THE EARL OF DERBY, K.G.
(Received February 10, 1885.)
(Extract.)
Sydney, December 31, 1884.
The telegrams received here from London announcing the establishment of a
Protectorate by Germany over the northern portion of New Guinea, and of New Britain,
New Ireland, and other adjacent islands, have caused surprise and agitation in the public
mind here as well as in the neighbouring Colonies.
Mr. Service has addressed to this Government a telegram requesting their co-operation
with those of the other Australian Governments in “ protesting ” against the German
annexation of any portion of the Island of New Guinea.
On informing me of Mr. Service’s telegram, of which I annex a copy, I observed
to Mr. Dailey that, in regard to the German reported annexation, we were as yet
without any official information, and I considered therefore that it would be most
injudicious to take any such step as that proposed by Mr. Service. It would be absurd
to “ protest ” against an undisputed right of Germany, while a “ protest ” against the
Imperial policy would be an act of serious gravity on the part of the Colonies. I advised
him, therefore, without isolating this Colony or refusing a legitimate co-operation with
the other Colonies in furtherance of a question so deeply affecting their interests, to
await further information before acceding to Mr, Service’s proposal.
I have the honour to enclose to your Lordship copy of the telegram addressed by
Mr. Dailey to Mr. Service, together with a minute giving the grounds for the course he
has taken, which he lias forwarded to the heads of the various Australian Governments,
and has requested me to transmit to your Lordship. This minute is intended as an
answer to the minute which Mr. Service has addressed to the Governor of Victoria, and
the object of it is to show the consistent course which this Government has taken from
the commencement of the New Guinea question, and the loyal wish of my Government
to abstain from causing embarrassment to Her Majesty’s Government in their relations
with Foreign Powers.
But it is my duty to inform your Lordship that great disappointment is felt at
the acquisition by Germany of any portion of New Guinea, while the annexation of the
other islands is not viewed with the same jealousy or disfavour.

Telegram from Mr. Service to Premier, Sydney.
23rd December 1884.—Telegram just received from Agent-General, stating that it is

Government against the recognition of Germany’s claims, especially on New Guinea.
J. Service.


Enclosure 2in No. 10. / u
Minute Paper.
Telegram of the Premier of Victoria requesting the Government of this Colony to
unite in protest to the Imperial Government against the German occupation of a
part of New Guinea.
The Cabinet has under its consideration the invitation addressed to the Colonial
Secretary by the Premier of Victoria, requesting the co-operation of this Government
with those of the other Australasian Colonies in protesting against the German annexation
of any portion of the Island of New Guinea, the intelligence of such action on the part
of Germany having been telegraphed here a few days since. Owing to the fact that
Mr. Service’s telegram was received late on the evening of the last day before the
Christmas holidays, since which day, without much personal inconvenience, no meeting
of the Cabinet could be convened, it has been found impossible to consider this question
at an earlier period. An answer to Mr. Service was despatched within a few moments of
the receipt of his telegram, in these words :
“ Shall have no objection to consider in Cabinet the form of your proposal; but would
suggest to you the expediency of some slight delay, as we have reason to believe that
steps may be shortly taken by the Imperial Government which will either render
remonstrance on our part unnecessary, or, if we now make it, will occasion embarrassment
without any advantage to the Colonies. At all events, no inconvenience will result from
a delay of a few days; and as my colleagues will not in all probability be in town after
to-night till Monday next, I should be unable to inform you of our determination at an
earlier period.
WILLIAM BEDE DALLEY.
As the action of this Government in advising delay has been in some quarters
misunderstood, it is deemed expedient to submit, for the perusal of His Excellency, and
in order that the views of this Government may be clearly and fully communicated to
Her Majesty’s Imperial Government, to place upon record the opinions of the Cabinet.
For many years, as is well known to all who are familiar with the subject from a' perusal
of the official correspondence which has taken place, and the various State Papers which
have been published, the successive Governments of this Colony have been in perfect
agreement as to the extreme desirableness, if not the absolute necessity, of the annexation
by the Imperial Government of the Island of New Guinea. Both in the maintenance
of Imperial, and in the guardianship of Colonial interests—in upholding the
maritime supremacy of England, and in guaranteeing the future peace of these
Colonies—it has been always regarded since first the question was discussed, almost
as indispensable that this step should be taken. It is well known that nearly ten
years ago a much more ambitious and extended scheme of annexation was urged upon
the Imperial Government by the then Administration of Sir John Robertson, in which
two members of this Government, including the Premier, held office. That scheme not
merely comprehended the necessity of an entire possession of New Guinea, but
included the Islands of New Britain, New Ireland, and the chain of islands to the north-
east and east of New Guinea, from Bougainville Island to San Christoval, the south-
easternmost of the Solomon Group, the Group of the New Hebrides, including Espiritu
Santo, Malicolo, and Sandwich, with smaller adjoining islands, and the Marshall, Gilbert,
and Ellice Islands. At the time this representation was forwarded to the Imperial
Government, and perhaps for some years afterwards, the realisation of the scheme was
not only possible but would in all probability have provoked no antagonism on the part
of foreign governments, and aroused no feeling of jealousy whatever. Of late years,
however, although from the Colonial point of view the question is precisely in the same
state as it was, and the feeling as to the necessity of this annexation is unaltered, the
European aspect of the situation is entirely changed. That which could then have been
effected without disturbance or opposition, is now either altogether impossible or
surrounded with grave international difficulties. The reluctance of England to attempt
fresh Colonial enterprises, even though they were, as in this case, shown to be essential
to the freedom from peril to our lines of ocean communication with the mother country,
and, as was pointed out by Sir John Robertson in his minute, to the protection of a
coast line, 1,700 miles in extent, stretching from this capital northwards to within
sight of New Guinea, has resulted in the present condition of things. And this
indisposition on the part of the Imperial Government which, as is well understood,
is a cardinal principle of the political faith of a great party in the mother country,
which strongly resists any extension of the Colonial responsibilities of the Empire
u 16272.


has naturally inspired foreign Governments, proposing to establish or extend
Colonial possessions, with the idea that in exercising their unquestionable right to
pursue this policy they are not by such exercise doing anything to justify the
least dissatisfaction on the part of England. It is essential to bear this in mind when
this Government is invited to adopt a course of action which may involve serious con-
sequences in its relations with the Imperial Government, and perhaps not less serious
embarrassments in the relations of the latter with the Governments of foreign countries.
From the date of the sittings of the Convention up to the present time this Government
has been profoundly sensible of these difficulties, a statement of which it placed clearly’
before the Convention, and a consideration of which has guided the whole of its
correspondence on the subject. This Government has in no way changed its views
in the matter, and is fully prepared to join with the Governments of all the
other Australasian" Colonies in any effective representations as to the necessity of largely
increasing the area of the Protectorate already established in New Guinea. But
in order to render these representations in any way effective, or even intelligible,
and to prevent useless correspondence, and the misunderstanding which would almost
certainly flow from the present entirely defective information on the subject, it is
essential that this Government should know precisely,—lst. Whether the recent action
of Germany’ is the result of an arrangement with the Imperial Government ? 2nd, What
are the terras of this arrangement ? 3rd. Whether as one of the conditions of this
agreement, the English Protectorate of New Guinea has been enlarged so as to
include the shores of the island from East Cape to the German line of occupation ?
4th. Whether, as seems not improbable, from the recent inclusion, by an amendment of
the Schedule of the Proclamation, of the islands of the D’Entrecasteaux Group in the
Protectorate of New Guinea, the Imperial Government has determined to include
various other islands, as for example the Louisiade Group, Rook Island, the Woodlark
Group, and others, the possession of which would strategically command the whole of
that portion of the Pacific. It is impossible, in the absence of information on these
subjects, not merely to prepare but even to consider the terms of any remonstrance to
the Imperial Government. If England is acting in concert with the Great European
Powers who are about to undertake or extend colonization in the Pacific, it is
essential that this fact should be known before any’ representations on the subject are made
by any of her Colonies. Deeply and peculiarly as they are interested in this question, it
would be simply indefensible that they should, without any information, address vague
and meaningless protests, which would be certainly valueless, and probably embarrassing.
If the Imperial Government is free from international obligations, and has given no
countenance to the recent annexation, it may be desirable, by strong and unanimous
representations, to urge, with regard to the occupation of Is ew Guinea by a Foreign
Power, those arguments which have already been so frequently and so forcibly addressed
to successive Secretaries of State. And finally, if the German occupation of a part of
New Guinea has been the subject of international arrangement, and the Imperial
Government has taken care to provide for a largely increased area of its own Protectorate
over the shores of New Guinea and adjacent islands up to the boundary of Germany,
any such representations may be wholly unnecessary. This Government has thus, it
will he seen, been guarded in its course of action, by a determination to uphold the views
on this subject to which it has consistently given expression; and at the same time to
abstain from anything which would have the appearance of either questioning the
undoubted rights of European nations in friendly alliance with our own Imperial Govern-
ment, or presuming to dictate to the latter on questions of Imperial policy. And, more-
over, to take no steps in questions of such gravity and complexity, without the fullest
information concerning the whole situation. Tnis will involve a brief, but, however,
absolutely necessary delay. Having regard to all these circumstances, this Government
will be fully prepared, immediately on the receipt of authoritative information, to cordially
co-operate with the other Australian Colonies in taking such steps as it may deem neces-
sary to secure the object which they are all equally interested in achieving. The Cabinet
desires that a copy of this minute be presented to His Excellency, for the information
of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and that copies be also forwarded to the heads
of the various Australian Governments.

No. 1.
Precis of the Supplementary Report of the Senate Committee (M. de Yerninac),
January 1885.
1, Introduction'.
The report begins by stating that the debates in the Senate on the first reading of the
Bill (23-25 October) had traced the points to which the Committee had to direct their
attention before the second reading.
In those debates the fact had come out that while no one contested the imperious
necessity of restraining the growing extent of relapse into crime, grave doubts had arisen
as to the possibility of carrying the Bill into effect for want of a place where the relegation
of recidivists could take place.
New Caledonia, it was said, was already cumbered with 10,000 forcats and lihcrcs ;
and as to Guiana, the failure, of all attempts at colonisation there, and the abandonment
of transportation after 15 years’ experience, had shown that even incorrigible criminals
could not now be sent there without inhumanity.
Besides carefully examining a variety of documents, the Committee had taken the
evidence of M. Fdlix Faure, Under Secretary of State for the Colonies, Captain Pallu dc
la Barrihre, late Governor of New Caledonia, M. Franconie, deputy for Guiana, and
others ; and they hoped that their present conclusions would appear to be justified. •
2. Place of Relegation.
As to Guiana, the Sanitary Council of the Marine Department had formally condemned
any proposal to renew transportation there ; this, however, had been strongly contested
by the Under Secretary of State.
* No. 7.;
B 2


As to New Caledonia, Governor de la Barri6re had confirmed by his evidence the
adverse opinions he had expressed in his Despatch of October 1883, appended to the
Committee’s first report. Though the climate of that colony was excellent and its soil
fertile, the State territory there was hardly sufficient to ensure to the convicts who would
be sent there even up to 1888 the concessions promised by the law of 1854, and at the
same time reserve land enough to enclose ( encadrer) the penal settlement within free
colonisation. Besides, New Caledonia was still in its infancy as a colony. Industry did
not exist there, and the 3,000 lihdrds constrained to residence had to be maintained by
the State for want of other work. The nickel mines had not recovered from the crisis
caused by the failure of the Bank of New Caledonia; moreover, the owners of those
mines all preferred the less costly and ymsi-servile labour of the New Hebrides recruits.
Lastly, M. Schoelcher (senator) had laid before the Committee a protest by M. Moncelon,
delegate from New Caledonia, and there was a similar protest from the Cornell General
of Guiana, against applying the Bill to either colony.
The Committee had been last year of opinion that it would be useless, and even
dangerous, to define in the Bill the colonies where relegation might take place; and now
a more exhaustive study of the question had shown that in the interest of the law itself
it was necessary to leave to the Government an even larger choice of the territories in
which to put the scheme in force. With this object the first section of the Bill had been
amended by the omission of the words “ colonies or possessions,” thus suppressing every
restriction as to the places to be selected for relegation, one condition only being made,
that these places were not to be assimilated to prisons.
It would, of course be said that this was giving the Executive a blank cheque (blanc-
seing). Certainly that was not to be denied. But Parliament would each year be able
to exercise a control through the estimates ; and, besides, in presence of difficulties which
it would be puerile to dissemble, and in view of the large numbers which (especially a
first) would come under the law, the Committee had thought it wisest to leave to the
Executive the fullest latitude in 'selecting the places where this crowd of malefactors
might be utilised, who, if accumulated at one point, would certainly constitute there a
great embarrassment, if not a public danger.
The Committee did not, however, exclude any place, and notwithstanding the grave
objections made against Guiana, they did not mean to say that the Government could
not or ought not to make the attempt there. Nor did the Committee even hold that in
New Caledonia, notwithstanding the embarrassment already caused by the presence of
7,000 formats and 3,000 lihdrds , it would not be possible to send a certain number of
reldguds. And perhaps at Senegal, or some other French possession, recidivists might
be employed upon public works for which free workmen were now imported at a great
cost.
Profoundly convinced still of the necessity of the law, the Committee could not admit
that any difficulties should be allowed to prevent or suspend its effect, and they therefore
hoped that the Senate, sharing in that feeling, would adopt their present proposals.
3. Regime to be applied to the Relegues.
While public opinion in France had manifested a legitimate impatience for the banish-
ment of incorrigible criminals who made a trade of violating every social law, it must be
admitted that in the colonies threatened with the reception of these criminals public
opinion had declared itself with undeniable energy against the scheme. The Chamber
of Commerce of Noumea and the delegate of New Caledonia emulated the council and
the member for Guiana in protests against this new kind of transportation. Was there
any right to be surprised at this? Neither past history nor present circumstances could
give much confidence about the future. It must be acknowledged that the transportation
which began in 1852 had not in 32 years produced, from the colonial point of view
of either New Caledonia or Guiana, the results which had been expected. [Here follows
an account of the ruinous failure at Guiana.] At New Caledonia after 15 years of
transportation, and with an effectif of 10,000 people, hardly 50 miles of road had been
constructed, and the harbour of Noumea was still without facilities which its geographical
position and its prospective importance demanded. At best a few hundreds out of the
thousands transported had become attached to the soil in either of the penal colonies.
What had become of the lihdrds constrained to temporary or perpetual residence under
the law of 1854 ? For the most part without work, falling back on the State for support,
subject to no discipline, they had only been a source of disturbance and demoralisation
to tlie free colonists. Such results, established by all the information before the Com-
mittee, now justified them in saying that if the law of 1854 had solved one side of the


problem by averting the progress of graver crimes, its colonial side yet awaited solution.
Did this mean that a solution was impossible ? Far be it from the Committee to think/
so. They still believed in the utility of transportation and in the possibility of turning
it to the advantage of the colonies. But the Government must give their attention to
the reforms required in the whole penal system beyond sea, and especially to the
position, hitherto ill-defined, of the libercs.
The necessity for these reforms had doubtless been a chief cause of the alarm in New
Caledonia and Guiana, but another cause lay in the fact of its having been proposed to
leave the recidivists, when once relegated under the condition of not leaving the colony,
in a state of absolute liberty and in the possession of common rights. This idea, embodied
in the original report of M. Gerville-Reache and the debates in the Chamber of Deputies,
had never been shared by the Senate Committee. A regime of absolute liberty and of
common rights, to be possessed by incorrigible malefactors, had always seemed to them
to constitute a peril for any colony so great that the law could not haye been really
carried out. Those convicts only who could provide for their own wants ought to enjoy
liberty, limited by police measures necessary for the public safety. As for those who,
without the means of existence, became chargeable to the State, the right to require
forced labour from them was This had always been the opinion of the
Committee, and their renewed investigation had now led them to declare in more express
terms, in the very first section of the Bill, not only the meaning of relegation, but the
consequences it must entail upon the convicts.
The Committee, when examining more closely the application of the system, had
asked themselves whether it would not be well to unify the two penal administrations,
metropolitan and colonial. It seemed, indeed, that officials who had seen what the
recidivists were in the prisons and in the central and country penitentiaries must best be
competent to control ( surveiller ) them in the place of relegation. The Committee of
the Chamber of Deputies had originally thought so too, but the prospect of conflicts
between the two ministerial departments concerned had caused the rejection of the plan.
The Senate Committee, while admitting the question to be a delicate one, must content
themselves by saying that it was one which must be left to the Government to solve.
4. Number to tohorn the Law would be applicable.
A return from the Ministry of the Interior had shown that on the Ist October 1883
the various penal establishments in France, Corsica, and Algiers contained 5,203 criminals
who would have come under the Bill as voted by the Chamber of Deputies. The Senate
Committee had accordingly taken 5,000 at that time as the approximate number for the
first year, and 3,000 or 4,000 for the second, and a later return, dated last September,
had shown that about 4,660 would be the number for the third year. A further return,
however, now made by the Minister of Justice at the instance of the Committee had
shown that not less than 30,000 criminals would have come under the original Bill and
about 21,000 under the amended Bill. But it had been argued within the Committee
that even this number would turn out to be much less than the reality, that the growing
augmentation of recidive had not been taken into account, that sentences of military and
naval tribunals entailing relegation had been altogether left out, that various offences
had also been omitted, that even now more than 30,000 recidivists would come immediately
under the law, that even this number only included criminals who would have to be
relegated by a first sentence after the promulgation of the law, leaving out entirely
numbers who (by reason of previous sentences) would be in the same category as the
first; that it must now be admitted that there were more than 60,000 criminals on whom
a fresh sentence would entail relegation ; and that as it was notorious that the incorrigibles
among them were never long without reappearing before a tribunal, it was not 12,000,
but perhaps 30,000, who would have to be relegated in the first three years.
But of what value was the return from the penal establishments ? The data were
altogether insufficient. The figures really wanted were not those of criminals who would
in a single year come under relegation, but of those who, having undergone previous
sentences, would yet have to be relegated. If it was evidently correct that the 21,000
indicated by the Minister must be very much increased, still there was nothing to show
the particular time when the criminals would come into the hands of justice or when
sentences would expire. The Committee did not pretend that the return from the penal
establishments gave an exact estimate of the number that would be relegated in the first
year after the passing of the Bill. But it afforded a sufficient indication, and, all things
considered, it was not impossible to admit that the Government estimate approached the
truth.
B 3


Bat even supposing that estimate to be too low, what then?' It was said that the
figures proved that a law so rigorous must in a short time compel the State to relegate a
total number not only much in excess of any that had been foreseen, but one all the more
embarrassing because nobody could even say where or how the relegation was to be
carried out. But such criticisms, if once admitted, must go to nothing less than a
declaration that the law was an impossible one, and to its consequent rejection. The
majority of the Committee could not subscribe to that. Even were the option of
sentencing to relegation left to the Courts, it could not be admitted that when a judge
pronounced a sentence he had to concern himself with any difficulties in its application.
Undoubtedly, the greater the number of criminals to be relegated, the costlier and more
difficult must be the execution of the law ; but it was precisely for that reason that the
Committee thought the Government must be left to provide for the difficulties. On the
other hand, the more proofs were accumulated of the number of habitual malefactors
being three or four times what had been foreseen, the more was the gravity established
of the peril they were to society, and the clearer was the necessity for such a measure of
public safety as was now before the Senate.
5. Counter-project oj M, Berenger.
[lt is unnecessary to transcribe here the arguments by which the Committee condemn
M. Berenger’s scheme for combating relapse into crime, instead of resorting to trans-
portation].
6. Amendments moved, in the Committee .
One of these amendments (by M. Labiche), making a sentence of relegation optional
with the Courts, had been rejected upon a division in the Committee of six votes to
three, as being contrary to the whole character of the Bill. Another (by General
Robert) preventing the relegation from having the effect of removing the relegne from
the army, and so releasing him from military service, had received the general assent of
the Committee in principle, .and had been met by a provision for the purpose; but the
Government must be left to regulate its application, pending some specific provision in
the recruiting laws.
8. New Amendments to the Bill explained.
[Section 1 as reconstructed defines more completely the meaning of relegation, as in-
volving (1) internment within territories to be selected by the Government, (2) a regime
to which the relegues are to be subjected, and (3) enforced labour by all who remain
chargeable to the State.
Amendments in Sections 8 and 12 meet the preceding proposals of Senators Labiche
and Robert.
Amendments in Sections 2,4, 6, 13, 14, 15, 19> and 23 are either not material or are
consequential].
Section 22 (new clause). In their First Report, the Committee had named one j T ear
as the earliest time for the Act coming into operation. They still thought it impossible
for the Legislature to retreat from the passing of a law which it had rightly deemed
urgent, Nevertheless it must be evident that the law could not be put in force before
establishments ( installations ) had been prepared for the reception of the relegues. After
a new examination of this question, one of the most delicate which the Committee had
had to consider, they had asked themselves whether any law of this kind could be perfect at
first. The proposed remission of all the regulations to the Executive, must seem to
subordinate the law itself to the promulgation of the regulations without which it could
not be carried out. But where could any relegation be made at all, if the place of
relegation was not first determined ? How could the relegues be made to work when
even the regime of their workshops was not fixed ? How could the public safety be
assured if measures to that end were not first taken ? It therefore seemed indispensable
to declare in set terms, what was really in the nature of things, that the law should not
come into force until after issue of the regulations. Six months would be allowed to
the Government for this purpose; a date, however which could easily be shortened if
the Executive were really imbued with the necessity of giving prompt satisfaction to
public opinion.

Appendices to the Report.
1 . Evidence of Governor Pallu de la Barriere.
In 1882, out of 10,000 forgats and liberes, only 300 had obtained concessions of land,
and 1,500 petitions for concessions remained unanswered, a few of these having been
made as far back as 10 years. When Governor Pallu left, 600 concessions had been
granted. The liberes constituted the great difficulty of transportation. It was difficult
for them to get work, and if they had not been attached to the soil during their sentence,
while the Executive had control over them, they were apt to abuse their liberty when
they got it. New Caledonia could in no way receive any recidivists. They would not
find work any more than the liberes; there were no industries in the colony, which was
in its infancy, and the liberes furnished more workmen than were wanted ; while the free
colonists would always prefer, for agricultural purposes, recruits from the New Hebrides
who only cost 45 francs per month, or forgats at 65 francs, to liberes who required 8 to 10
francs per day. The relegues would have to be paid the same, though they would be
more dangerous and less apt to work than the forgats ; and if they did not get work,
they would perforce come back upon the State, as the liberes did, for sustenance.
As to concessions of land, the free lands in New Caledonia were already on the point
of failing.
The colony comprised ... 2,100,000 hectares.
The aborigines occupied - - 316,000
Concessions to colonists - - ■ 236,000
Reserves for penal purposes - - 38,000
Forests - - - - - 127,000
Unavailable lands - - - 1,100,000 1,817,000 ~
Leaving only 283,000 hectares.
Now out of these 283,000 hectares, 200,000 consisted of. pasturage, leaving only 83,000
fit for cultivation, of which 17,000 were gently wooded slopes where coffee might be
grown ; only that ground being counted as arable which was situated in valleys where
the soil was from Bto 10 metres deep. These 83,000 acres would barely suffice for the
normal operation of the law of 1854 up to 1888, that is to say, for the necessary con-
cessions to convicts, and also for the free emigration which was the indispensable
counterpoise to transportation. This acreage must be halved between penal and free
colonisation; so that in order to allow of concessions to relegues , either the time (even
now not far distant ) for ceasing all transportation to New Caledonia must be shortened,
or any allotment of land to free colonists must be given up, which meant the ruin of the
colony.
Besides, relegation and transportation could not be set down side by side without
immense inconvenience. New Caledonia was a colony of the first importance, which the
mother country ought to do everything to foster. [Then follow details of the system
put in force by the Governor during his'administration.] The number of free colonists
could not be exactly stated, but there were perhaps 4,000, chiefly Frenchmen. The
u 16272. C


capital employed in the colony was French, Australian, and Scotch. The country was
something like New South Wales; the minerals chiefly nickel, though there was also
copper and silver, and even some gold. The interior of the island had not been
touched ; the mines had been only prospected, not worked, for want of means of com-
munication. The colony was amply endowed with water, and there was no fear of
droughts; but the pasturage was not suited for sheep, on account of some poisonous
herb. The cattle were a very poor sort, and only preserved Australian milk was to be
had.
There were 27,000 Kanakas in New Caledonia, and 13,000 at the Loyalty Isles : a
vigorous, intelligent race, wholly different from Australian blacks, and very independent;
they would not submit to regular work, but it might be got out of them by arrangement
with the Chiefs; they were good cultivators, and understood irrigation perfectly. No
more land could be got from the natives ; what they occupied was indispensable to them,
as crops could not be raised often on the same soil for want of manure, except with more
or less fallow. Attempts at educating them had entirely failed at first, but by sending
teachers among the tribes the Governor had made a perfect success, the Kanakas easily
learning to read and, write.
The Committee of 28 colonists appointed to study the subject generally, had not
considered the present Bill; they accepted transportation, but only on the condition of
its ceasing on the day when no more land was available, and also of a counterpoise being
secured by free colonisation. The Chamber of Commerce had rejected the scheme of
relegation. A few colonists, it was true, wanted recidivists to be sent, but they were a
small minority of stock owners, who saw in it an increased consumption of meat. Not
more than 40 or 50 liberes occupied their concessions. About 450 convicts were
married, and 50 more lived with native women. Wheat could be grown, but it ripened
so unequally that its cultivation had been so far impossible. As for the concessions
which remained unworked, there was no reservation in the grants, and therefore no legal
means of getting them back except by taxing all uncultivated ground; a step, however,
which would make the position of any Governor adopting it very difficult. There was
nothing fixed as to maximum or minimum of concession, but a colonist, to be able to live
with his family, ought to have from 15 to 20 hectares, 4 to he arable, and the rest in
pasture.
2. Evidence of MM. Schoelcher and Michaux.
M. Schoelcher presented protests from Guiana and New Caledonia, confirming all
that the Governors of those Colonies had said. The protest by the delegate from new
Caledonia adjured the Government and Legislature of the mother country, after having
inflicted upon the colony one scourge in the liberes, not to inflict upon it another yet
worse in the relegucs. M. Michaux refused his assent to the Bill, especially on account
of the effect it would have in Guiana. A decree in 1863 had established the penal
settlement of New Caledonia, and in 1867 a Ministerial decision had appointed it as the
place where all convicts should be transported; but there was no trace of any report or
other document from the colony : to justify that decision ; if any had ever existed, they
were lost or destroyed.
3, Statement by the Sanitary Council of the Marine Department.
4. Evidence of M. Eranconie, Deputy for Guiana.
5. Minute by M. Felix Faure, Under Secretary of State,
6. Minute by the Governor of Guiana, M. Chesse.
All these papers relate chiefly to Guiana; but the last is a powerful and sustained
argument against the whole scheme of relegation as originally proposed, and. especially
against the relegues being free. _ In 1878, 3,656 convicts transported to Guiana had
cost 219,865 francs (9,599/.); in 1884, only 2,443 had cost 441,900 francs (17,676/.).
The cost of the scheme might begin at hundreds of thousands of francs, but would soon
be counted by millions. Out of 22,000 convicts transported since 1854, perhaps 10
liberes might be counted as having established themselves, and these were old soldiers
who really had only the name of formats. So after all the cost that would be lavished,
the recidivist would be neither punished nor reformed; but be would have that done for
him which many poor but honest families in France herself might envy. Governor
Chesses then went on to propose a system under which relegation might be carried out,
provided that the law itself laid down that every rele'gue who was a charge to the State


should be constrained to forced labour and subjected to discipline and to military juris-
diction. [This system would really be one of rigorous repression, essentially antagonistic
to the scheme as voted by the Chamber of Deputies.]

No. 1.
Puccis of the Report of the Senate Committee (M. de Yerninac).
1. Utility of the Bill.
The Report begins by referring to the ever-increasing number of relapsed and habitual
criminals, to the fear and indignation thereby excited among all classes, and to the
remedy sought in transportation; which had led to several schemes being submitted to
the Legislature, and at last to the Bill passed by the Chamber of Deputies on the 30th
June 1883. Although crimes of a grave character had largely diminished since 1854,
those of a lesser degree had been constantly increasing; and each year, with alarming
regularity and intensity, the proportion was growing of relapse into habitual crime. The
proportion of recidivists to the whole body of criminals, which in 1850 was only 20 per
cent., reached in 1882 44 per cent,, the total number being 78,998 ; and now there was
seen to exist in the lower strata of society a class becoming every day more numerous,
which reduced crime to a profession. This class, attacking property by preference,
resorted chiefly to theft (in all its forms), breach of trust, and swindling; murder or
assassination being mostly a means for committing other crimes or escaping from punish-
ment. Offences against the person were almost exclusively those affecting morals,
including public outrages against modesty, excitation of the young to debauchery, and
procuring of prostitution. The progress of this social sore had proved alike the impo-
tence of the existing systems of repression, and the necessity for a prompt and energetic
remedy.
The perversity indicated by the reiteration of crimes which in themselves were, rela-
tively speaking, hardly grave, had not been sufficiently taken into account by jurisconsults.
It would not suffice to amend the Penal Code in the direction proposed by M. Berenger.
Neither prisons nor penitentiaries could really avail against habitual criminals, two-fifths
of the prisoners discharged from penitentiaries in 1880 having been again sentenced for
.fresh crimes up to the end of 1882. The unavoidable conclusion is that the only remedy,
or at least the only means of self-preservation, must be sought in transportation; and an
exhaustive study of the problem only points to the same solution which public opinion
had already instinctively reached.
2. Transportation as a Punishment,
Transportation has always had its advocates and its passionate adversaries. These
allege that it is only an empirical device for removing the presence of the evil, without
suppressing its causes; that, hurtful as the criminal classes are in the mother country,
they will not be less so in the colony which has the misfortune to receive them, while the
further they are sent the greater will be their cost; and that, fatal in itself to a colony
as introducing an element of disorder and ruin, transportation is also useless as a means
of repression of crime. Nevertheless, the Chamber of Deputies passed the Bill by a
majority of 344 to 87, and the majority of the Senate Committee has also now adopted
its principle. It is true that in older and more prosperous colonies, possessing a high
civilisation and an adequate population, transportation would not only be a calamity but
be devoid of common sense : nor could it ever eiitef into the mind of anyone to choose, for
02


instance, as places for transportation such colonies as the Antilles or Reunion : it would
be as reasonable to intern criminals from Gironde in the Department of the Rhone. But
it is not so with a virgin country, hardly inhabited. Again, it had been objected that it
is chimerical to believe in any future for convict colonies. But without going farther into
the past, the contemporary example of Australia seems to prove what results can be
attained by penal colonisation. It is said that although Australia submitted for 80 years
to transportation, she would have broken her ties to England rather than let it be con-
tinued. But what conclusion ought to be drawn from this ? Only that the limit of a
colony to absorb and utilise the scum of the mother country is not indefinite. Every
one knows how persistently the Australians deny having ever received any benefit from
transportation. Nor need anyone - be surprised at those new and marvellously prosperous
countries repudiating their origin: a time will doubtless come when, in Sydney, Governor
Phillip and his comrades in exile will be spoken of as fabulous and legendary beings.
But that anywhere outside of Australia even the greatest adversaries of transportation
would be found to argue that it cannot be and has never been anything but a source of
ruin to a colony, is what the Committee cannot admit. It is true that penal colonisation
cannot suffice by itself, and must be associated with and enclosed ( encadrer ) within a
free colonisation ; and it had been the glory and greatness of England, as well as her
profit, that she hud known how to solve this problem. Of course, any accumulation of
large numbers of convicts at one point must bring about excesses and disorders ; but has
there not been violence at-every beginning of colonisation? and can it be supposed that
even free colonists are recruited from the healthier parts of old societies ? Did the morals
of the Far West or California resemble, even only 30 years ago, not to say those of Paris
or London, but those of New York, or Boston, or Philadelphia? It only needs to
mention lynch law to show how great was the difference. What was Australia in 1787,
when Philip landed at Botany Bay ? A desert. What is she now ? One of the richest
and most prosperous countries in the Avorld. And who is there that will believe that
the 180,000 convicts who in those 80 years were sent to Australia left no traces, when
it is remembered that in 1854, only 30 years ago, they formed in New South Wales and
Tasmania three-fifths of the population ? Nor must it be forgotten that when trans-
portation was given up on the persistent protests of the other Australias, Queensland,
the latest founded, still desired convicts to be sent to her, and her demands were only
silenced by the threats of her more powerful neighbours. After such examples, to deny
the possibility of a penal colonisation, to deny its being the best if not the only means of
utilising that impure element in the mother country which is a cause of so many dangers,
is, in the Committee’s opinion to deny the evidence of facts. The Committee firmly
believe that France can, if she only chooses, attain results analogous, if not equal, to
those attained by England. At any rate, no one can say, without being contradicted by
undeniable facts, that transportation in a colony almost uninhabited to-day, can ever he
a serious obstacle to her development.
If the utility, or at least the possibility, of transportation be once admitted, then,
looking at it from the point of view of the security of France, the expulsion of habitual
criminals seems the only way to check the rising tide of habitual crime. Take, for
instance, the effect of the law of 1854. [Here follow a number of criminal statistics.]
Can any one deny the efficacy of a law which has produced such results ? and is
there not hope for analogous effects from this Bill ? But, it is objected, penal legislation
will be completely upset. Transportation, which has hitherto been deemed the gravest
penalty next to death, would no longer be reserved for great criminals condemned to the
galleys, but would be applied to mere minor criminals. The gravity of this objection
has not escaped the Committee ; but it can be answered. It is not proposed to apply
the law of 1854 to recidivists. The purpose of that law was to remove far from French
soil the galleys ( bagnes ) which were for every one "an object of scandal and horror; and
it subjected even those liberes who had served their time, to a perpetual (or at any rate
prolonged) sojourn in a distant colony. It is to these liberes, and not to the forgats, that
the recidivists now being dealt with may be likened. The Bill certainly removes them
from the mother country, and interns them in a colony with the condition of not leaving
it; but, subject to that condition, they are and will remain free, under the single reserva-
tion of such measures of order and police as the Government must have the right and
the power lo adopt, in order to prevent this liberty from degenerating into licence,
becoming a danger to the free colonists, and troubling the security of all. It is not the
bagne that is meant, it is only exile; and in order the better to differentiate the position,
even in its terms, the Committee have not hesitated to adopt, as the Chamber of Deputies
did, the new name of “ relegation,” as one that expresses more completely the novelty it
introduces into penal jurisprudence. [Here follows an elaborate argument in favour of


the scheme of relegation.] Last October [lßß3] the Government directed an inquiry to
be made in all the penitentiaries of France and Algeria, as to the probable effect of the
Bill. Out of 54 reports, 47 recommended the adoption of the scheme, and most of them
deemed it to be a necessary preliminary to any prison reform ; while all, or nearly all,
spoke of the great impression produced by it upon the prisoners, though this impression
had unfortunately been effaced by the belief that the Bill would not be carried into
effect.
3. Ought Relegation to be Perpetual and Compulsory ?
Relegation ought to be perpetual, for this alone will make it feared, and experience
has shown that it is only when a return to France is forbidden for ever, that transported
convicts will seek to make for themselves a new life by honest labour. But, differing in.
this respect from the Chamber of Deputies, the Committee wish to give the reUgues a
hope, however distant, of seeing their country once more, by good conduct and by a
resort to work. Then, as to relegation being compulsory instead of being left to the
sentence of a judge, it is only after long hesitation that the Committee have adopted the
views of the Chamber. Against many admittedly strong arguments in favour of relega-
tion being only imposed in each case b}’ a judge, a number of cogent reasons have made
the Committee resolve (though by a majority of six to three) to make it compulsory.
Out of 78,998 recidivists who were tried in 1882, 11,690 (15 per cent.) had merely been
fined, 63,150 (80 per cent.) had been sentenced to less than a year’s imprisonment, and
only 4,158 (3 per cent.) to more than a year; while nearly two-thirds (65 per cent.) of
the “ legal ” recidivists who were condemned anew in 1882, were sentenced for vaga-
bondage, mendicity, breach of conditions of ticket-of-leave, and theft. But a decision
in favour of compulsory relegation must entail, as a matter of course, a limitation of the
crimes to be subjected to it; and these are accordingly comprised under the general
formula of “ crimes against property and morals,” namely, theft, swindling, breach of
trust, public outrage against modesty, and habitual excitation of minors to debauchery.
In fact these are the crimes which by their nature and frequency may be called “ pro-
fessional,” and in 1882 they were in proportion of 56,456 out of 153,655.
4, 5. Vagabondage and Mendicity , Breach of ticket-of-leave (rupture de ban).
The Committee here explain their views on these subjects at great length.
6. How to carry out the Bill.
The Committee have not thought it sufficient merely to accept and justify the
principle of the Bill; they had also to examine into its application. In October 1883, a
Government inquiry showed that about 5,000 prisoners would then have been subjected to
the Bill. Were they to throw this mass upon a far distant shore, without organisation or
previous precautions ? To have done so would have been culpable imprudence. Relega-
tion ought only to be resorted to after expiry of the principal sentence. While this
sentence is being undergone, and while the recidivists are waiting for the vessel that is
to convey them, they must be classified, and their aptitudes and chances of moral
redintegration carefully studied. The best of them, artizans for the most part, and of
course the least numerous, must be sent to those colonies where their presence may be
utilised. The colonial administration must indicate the places where they can find work,
and facilitate their obtaining it. Allotments must be set apart for them in those centres
of colonisation where there is likely to be a deficiency of artizans. This will be “ indi-
vidual relegation.” Then as to the bulk of the criminals, they must be dealt with by
“ collective transportation ” to a colony where they will be interned. The Committee
do not conceal from themselves that difficulties will then begin, which can only be over-
come by patience, firmness, steadfast purpose, and a profound study of penitentiary science.
What, in fact, is to be done with all .these men landed in an unknown country? The
first care of the Administration must be to get them work; but as it cannot be hoped
that the free colonists can or will employ them all, the State must supply their wants.
And as no one would think of the State giving them food and lodging without exacting
something in return, it will be necessary to open workshops of various kinds for them,
where they must submit to whatever rules arc imposed.
But this, it will be said, is the galleys ( bagne ). Not so. At the galleys the con-
victs must work wherever they are told, whereas here the relegue's cannot be detained if
they have resources of their own, or can honestly get their own living. If they come to
the State for help, as will probably be the case with the most part, there is nothing in
C 3


right or equity to prevent the State from attaching such conditions to that help as it
thinks fit. Free labourers who work in manufactories and arsenals often submit them-
selves to severe regulations; and why not the relegues? To those who exhibit any
willingness or aptitude for agriculture, allotments of land must be granted, and every
facility given to their wives and families to join them. To those who are unmarried, the
Government must facilitate marriage, as the best way of preventing such vices as once
disgraced Botany Bay. As for those who refuse to work, and would renew their life of
rapine, rigour must be resorted to. To govern this lazy and insubordinate class will
undoubtedly be a heavy task : it must be at once benevolent and severe ; benevolent to
those who show any desire of amendment, inexorable for all refractories.
When Governor Phillip landed at Botany Bay with his convicts and a handful of
soldiers, he had only a few tools, seeds, and provisions. England seemed to forget
them. Three years after, when a new batch of convicts arrived, many of the first had
succumbed to disease and privation: the rest had taken to work, and had begun to
receive its fruits. Hunger, that unanswerable argument, had subdued the most
rebellious. It is not a hundred years since this happened, and now-a-days it would not
be possible to deal so harshly: it should be said, indeed, in honour of France, that such
things would be absolutely foreign to her national character. Yet there must be no
sentimentalism, nor idea of doing for criminals what would not be done for free emi-
grants. The rSgime to which the relegues are to be subjected, must be one to awaken
in them a sense of duty and a taste for labour. By labour alone is their moral improve-
ment possible, by it alone can they cease to be a sterile burden for the mother country,
and a danger for the colony that receives them. Let every good endeavour be
encouraged and rewarded, but let any attempt to continue a life of idleness and rapine
be repressed without false sentiment. Relegation must not be to the colonies a source
of peril and ruin. The Bill as passed by the Chamber of Deputies gave ample powers
to the Executive, and the Committee would not diminish these. The law will be
difficult enough to work, and the responsibility of it heavy enough, without trammelling
it with legislative provisions which the delays of parliamentary procedure may prevent
being modified as required.
Following even farther upon the same line, the Committee have thought it not only
useless but dangerous to designate any particular places for the relegation. The Bill, as
it came up from the Chamber, named four colonies or possessions, namely, New
Caledonia, the Marquesas, the island of Phu-Quoc, and French Guiana. But every one
then believed, the Government equally with the Committee which drew up the Bill, and
even the Chamber of Deputies, that it was New Caledonia which would receive the
greater part of the relegues. This was clearly shown, indeed, by M. Gerville-Reache’s
report. But a number of reports from the various colonies had not then been received.
These are far from confirming the forecasts of either the Government or the Chamber at
that time.
As regards Phu-Quoc, it offers none of the conditions necessary for a penal colony.
As to the Marquesas, it may almost be said there is no land there at all; hardly could
the islands receive 700 or 800 relegues, and even then only at a great cost.
With regard to New Caledonia, Admiral Courbet’s report to the Minister of Marine,
when he left the Government of that colony to assume his command at Tonkin, gave
some ground for hoping that there, at any rate, the relegation would find a large enough
field, and one already prepared. But this is not the opinion of his successor, Governor
Pallu de La BarriSre. In a special report, he shows that New Caledonia already contains
12,000 persons who are either convicts undergoing sentence or libere's constrained to
residence; that the cultivable land in the island does not exceed 160,000 hectares,
including the areas already occupied by the aboriginal natives or appropriated to the
free colonists; that the State domain, already imprudently lessened by immense con-
cessions long ago, would soon be exhausted ; and that, unless it is meant to inflict a
mortal blow on the development of the colony, room ought to be left , for the free
colonists to enclose ( encadrer) the penal population.
In French Guiana, on the contrary, Governor Chessd, in a special report, declares
himself ready to receive the relegation, from which he hopes the best results. [Here
follow various details about Guiana.]
The Committee have carefully examined the documents laid before them by the
Government, but in the absence of precise data about the several colonies, and seeing
that the statements before them are, if not contradictory, hardly consistent with each
other, they have found it difficult to arrive at a distinct conclusion. They conferred
with the Under Secretary of State, and sought the advice and experience of the Minister


himself. Admiral Peyron, confirming to some extent the statements of Governor Pallu(
tells us that although “ collective relegation ” to New Caledonia is not possible, she
could receive a certain number of recidivists, skilled artisans especially being likely to be
of real service. As to Guiana, the Minister, who knows that colony well, thinks it the
most fitted of all for a penal settlement. France gave up transportation to Guiana in
1864, not because it was impossible, but because she had just acquired a possession
[New Caledonia] with a climate better and more suited to cultivation, and by its
analogy to Australia seeming to promise for penitentiary colonisation a success equal to
that obtained by England. But whatever place is fixed upon for the relegation, the
Minister added, ample time for preparation ought to be given, say from ten months to a
year. Upon full consideration, the Committee have thought that, always supposing the
execution of the measure to be possible, the responsibility of fixing upon any particular
colony is one which neither they nor the Senate ought to assume, but should properly be
relegated to the Executive: and it is proposed accordingly to leave altogether to the
Government the determination of the places of transportation. There are many
advantages in this course. In those possessions where the population is not dense, and
where skilled artisans are scarce, there will arise needs which the Government can satisfy
without the delays always entailed by legislation : and who knows that territories which
cannot be indicated to-day as places of relegation, may not to-morrow become available
for penal settlements ?
Lastly, the financial side of the question must be considered. Here also the Com-
mittee can only accept the figures given to them by the Minister of Marine; and these,
upon an estimate for three years, allowing for a relegation of four-fifths of the recidivists
to Guiana and one-fifth to New Caledonia, give in round numbers a sum of 9,000,000
to 10,000,000 francs (360,000/. to 400,000/.) per annum as the cost. This is, no doubt,
a heavy addition to the budget: but it would not be paying too dear for the safety of
the mother country ; besides, the cost of the criminals in France has to be considered,
as well as the evils they would inflict; and in the case of a law for a social preservation
like this, it ought not to be impeded by a budget question.
7. Explanation of the Amendments.
Here follows an exhaustive explanation of every amendment proposed by the Senate
Committee.
8. Conclusion.
Such, then, is the measure which the Committee recommend for the adoption of the
Senate. It hardly differs, except in construction and points of detail, from the Bill as it
came up from the Chamber. After a long and conscientious study extended over
numerous sittings, and after having several times examined the Ministers of Justice, the
Interior, and Marine, the Under Secretary of State for the Colonies, the Director of
Penitentiary Administration, and the Prefect of Police, the Committee are convinced
that, even allowing the measure is not perfect, it certainly is a necessity. It will not
immediately produce all the results hoped from it. It is no panacea which will to-day, or
even in a few years, suppress habitual crime. But it will cause minor crimes, and
the relapse from one crime to another, to diminish just as the crimes of a higher degree
have diminished, down to a normal number below which, in our present social condition,
it would be chimerical to expect they should ever fall.

Enclosure 3 in No. 11..
Recidivisit Bill,
Notes of the Debate in the French Senate on the 23rd, 24th, and 25th October, 1884.
[Note. —A large part of the speeches consisted of arguments for and against the prin-
ciple of transportation, and the fitness or otherwise of French Guiana as a place of
relegation. Only that portion of the debate is here extracted which seemed of
special interest to Australasia.
Upon the order of the day being read for the premilre deliberation on the Bill,
M. Berenger began the debate by objecting that neither the Bill itself nor the Com-
mittee’s Report, had given any real explanation of the character of “ relegation,” the
method for carrying it out, the places of transportation, or the sacrifices it would impose
on the Treasury. The scheme had no parallel in the criminal legislation of any country
but Russia; and while it must entail the gravest consequences, everything was to be
left to the Executive, not only as to method, but even as to locality. This was nothing
but a demand for a blank cheque to be given to the Government. There could only be
one reason for the silence of the Committee, namely the impossibility of fixing any
principle except the single one of compulsory relegation. Could a serious debate take
place on such terms ? He would not discuss now whether transportation, as a punish-
ment now abandoned everywhere, was a legitimate or efficacious one; nor whether it
was just, or even possible, to attempt it in the way proposed; nor the withdrawal of all
discretion to the magistrates; nor even the excessive powers confided to the Government.
But before resolving upon relegation, the Senate ought at least to know what the rele-
gation was really to be; the regime to which the criminals were to be subjected, the
place to which they were to be sent, and the cost which was to be incurred. Nothing
of all this was to be seen in the Bill. For instance, M. Gerville-Reache had designed
New Caledonia to receive the greatest number; surely it would have been only natural,
for the Committee to have ascertained, on this point, what were the precise intentions of
the Government, instead of resigning itself to a relegation in the air ( relegation en I’air).
The Committee had avowed the difficulty to be insoluble, but had immediately stepped
aside and remitted it to the Executive. In the same way as to the cost, the Committee
had betrayed an equal impotence to fix any basis. Not choosing to take upon itself to
propose anything real, it had simply advised the Senate to relieve itself from all
responsibility too, and leave everything to the Government. But there was a responsi-
bility which was only the more taken by making believe to fly from it. Who was to be
responsible if this measure ended in. seriously impairing the finances, in augmenting all
their embarrassments ? Take in the first place the regime: must not transportation
vary essentially according as it was applied ? The scheme now was, that while the


criminals were to arrive in the Colony freed from any penalty for prior offences, they
were to be subject to some regime; but the regime was not to be a reproduction of the
penalties they had undergone. Were the rcle'gue's, then, to be free (a Vetat de ÜberU) ?
or were they to be kept in confinement ? If they were to be free, they might themselves
have less objection; but then what kind of fate would their freedom be to the Colony ?
would not the sending of thousands of criminals threaten its very existence ? Besides,
how were the criminals to supply their own wants ( suffire d eux-m times) if they were
free ? In a thinly peopled Colony like Guiana, for instance, where were the criminals
to be housed ? who was to give them work ? They must have bread ; for how long ?
And the difficulty would increase as fast as the penal population. Did the Senate
suppose that work created itself, or that it must necessarily come into existence in a place
because workmen were sent there ? the end would be that they would have both to feed
and house all the criminals. The consequences would not only be bad for the finances,
but for the moral effect of relegation. What would soon be said, in the great towns and
country districts, where so many honest and laborious people found the earning of their
own bread from day to day so hard, when they learnt that the corrupt wretches who had
been deemed unworthy to remain on the soil of. Trance, were to be housed and fed
without having to work ? So much for the “ state of liberty.” But was it really
liberty that was meant ? The Committee Report left this point quite undecided, and
the Bill itself said absolutely nothing. The report ■was contradictory; for while
announcing this “ state of liberty,” it really went on to enact the opposite. It was, in
fact, a “ state of confinement.” Yet the bill was dumb. Then as to the place of trans-
portation. Could the Senate vote for “ relegation ” without indicating where it was to
be made ? or vote for sending criminals to “ a Colony ” without saying which ? The
report admitted that there ought not to be any transportation to a “prosperous ” Colony.
This disposed of some; but what of the rest ? The Chamber of Deputies, after long
debates, had fixed upon four: New Caledonia was to have 20,000, and there were the
Marquesas, Phu Quoc, and Guiana. Well, the Senate Committee now said it would be
imprudent to select those places; but did it propose any other? Not at all. Did not
that mean that there was not one of their Colonies that was really fit ? Victor Hugo
had called transportation “ the dry guillotine.” Yet it was to that they were being led.
The Committee said, in effect, that Guiana was the only possible Colony, yet the
responsibility of naming it was exactly what they would not take. Let the Senate look
at the other Colonies named by the Chamber of Deputies. Take New Caledonia,
There were some fine illusions once. New Caledonia was “ alone to suffice ” for the
relegation ; it was a “ vast territory ” ; it offered an unlimited field for “ concessions of
land ”; it had a “ good climate nothing was easier than to send 20,000 there. Well,
the Governor (M. Pallu de la Barriere) had been asked, and the moment his loyally
given answer came, New Caledonia had to be given up. The Governor had declared
there was no work to be got there, nor land to give. The Chamber of Deputies had
spoken of the “ dependencies of New Caledonia,” meaning the Loyalty Isles ; but here
again the Governor told them they were in face of an absolute impossibility. So much
for New Caledonia and its “ dependencies.” As for the Marquesas, the Committee had
admitted that only a few hundred criminals could ever be sent there; and as for Phu
Quoc, it was even impossible to send so many. There remained the New Hebrides.
The Chamber of Deputies had left these islands out, and the Senate knew very well
what diplomatic difficulties would arise if France attempted to use them for such a
purpose. At last the Committee, after passing all possible places in review, had divided
the relegation into 4-sths for Guiana, and l-sth for New Caledonia, Such a solution
was however impossible. But let the Senate remember that the Governor of New
Caledonia had said she could not receive one single recidivist: and the views of the
Governor of Guiana, M. Chesse, were mere illusions. Guiana was really uninhabitable
for Europeans. Everything, in fact, tended to the same conclusion, that the Senate
ought not to be asked to pass the Bill without knowing the place of relegation. Lastly,
there was the question of cost. The figures now given were sensibly different from
those which had been given to the Chamber of Deputies. The Committee had made no
real investigation into their estimates, and had simply accepted them from the Govern-
ment. Well, he [M. Berenger] absolutely denied them: they were a complete illusion.
Take the question of the garrisons. The figures given might perhaps suffice for 3,000
or 4,000 convicts, but what about 12,000, of whom a great part were free, or rather
30,000 as there would be in three years ? The Committee had evaded its responsibility,
and the Senate would be wanting to its own dignity and duty if it accepted such a
position. The scheme ought to be sent back tp the Committee for reconsideration.

M. Waldeck-Rousseau, Minister of the Interior, declined to follow M. Berenger into
the numerous questions he had raised, and proposed an entirely different method for the
debate. The Senate was in presence of a problem which really must be solved, which
involved the gravest and most complex social questions, and which could no longer be
put off. It would be time enough, after having first recognised the existence of an evil
that was growing each day, to discuss whether the form of treatment proposed was the
right one. In the Bill there were very diverse provisions; some touched the principle
of relegation, others the method of its application. The 19th section enacted that not only
the place of relegation, but also the conditions of work and subsistence, in a word the
whole regime, should be left to executive regulation. Now one might be in entire accord
with a principle, without agreeing on legislative provision for the details. The logical
and simple way was to ask first whether any law about the recidivists was necessary to
be passed at all, and if so, whether that law should be based on relegation. Thus he
[the Minister] might-well confine himself to asking the Senate first to decide the prin-
ciple of relegation, and afterwards go on to inquire if it was not absolutely indispensable
to leave the place, the conditions, and the cost of it, to executive regulation. But he
would meet the objections of M. Berenger, who was an eminent jurisconsult, by telling
him that the thing which would really be without precedent was to attempt, in a law on
transportation, to provide for even a part of what was required. He had himself brought
before the Chamber of Deputies the first proposal for relegation, which at that time was
called “ transportation ” ; and in the first draft everything was left to executive regula-
tion. The original scheme was really the same, therefore in that respect, as the one now
before the Senate to day ; and indeed the clause providing for executive regulation had
been taken word for word from the law of 1864. It was impossible therefore to reproach
the Government for doing anything for which there was no precedent: what they had
done, in fact, was nothing more than an addition to the law of 1854, by extending to
other classes of criminals what that law had prescribed for the worst type. But all this
might be discussed after settling the gist of the question, after looking the problem in
the face, and seeing what these recidivists really were. Many people thought they
knew what they were; every one, at any rate, was hearing about them, and suffering
from them; but very few really knew. These recidivists belonged to a class of criminals
so exceptional, that preconceived ideas of a penal philosophy were quite inapplicable to
them. A law ought to lay down principles, and if the Government claimed the right of
organising its penitentiary regime , it was only seeking from the legislative power the
requisite executive authority for it, asking not to have its hands tied, and while safe-
guarding the right of Parliament, securing the elasticity which was requisite in the law.
Was it not, in fact, plain that every executive regulation must depend on a question of
money ? Credits must therefore be asked from the Parliament; and thus the regula-
tions themselves would come under the review of the legislature. But M. Berenger had
said there were no colonies to which the recidivists could be sent; and that if there
were, nothing was known about how many would be sent there. That argument simply
amounted to saying that there were some colonies which were too good for recidivists,
and others which were not good enough. Was a colony mentioned where trade and
industry had taken root, it was objected that to send recidivists there was to sacrifice the
colonists. Was the colony one where there was a struggle for the means of existence,
it was objected that the recidivists would be sacrificed. This sensitiveness for criminals
was surprising ; compassion Avould be better for those who suffered from crime than for
those who committed it. No one, however, had ever thought of sending men, even the
most guilty, -where they could not live. As for New Caledonia, there was literally only
a word to say. The Committee’s reporter, alike with the Government, had shown that
the Government did not mean to relegate recidivists there in masses, though they might
in the interest of the colony itself, choose it for individual relegation {relegation
individuelle). Now there was an extremely interesting report of a Commission appointed
in New Caledonia by the Governor, M. Pallu de la Barrfore, in 1882. New Caledonia
had often been spoken of in all these discussions by persons who had generously made
themselves the advocates of the colony : so it was well to learn the opinions and the
thoughts of competent men there. Now when these were consulted in their own
interests, and asked whether sending recidivists there was such a sinister thing, they
answered with great wisdom that just as to colonise by transportation only was folly, so
to colonise by free people only Avas delusion. These men, Avho represented the most
respectable interests of New Caledonia, who possessed a patrimony acquired by per-
sistent and perilous labour, declared that it was impossible to do anything in that
country without convicts being sent from France. They favoured in the most energetic


terms the same kind of mixed colonisation as had made Australia; one that should com-
prise criminals whom the mother country expelled, and adventurous spirits who came to
take advantage of the resources of convict labour. They said what Governor Pallu had
indeed already shown, that until lately very little use had been made of these resources,
as was proved by the single fact that in less than two years M. Pallu had increased the
number of concessions of land from 308 to 608, or double. Moreover there had been
started in New Caledonia a programme of works, for which 6,000 labourers, partly
relegues and partly liberc's, would be required, and who in 10 years would furnish 4,000
relegues for concessions of land. But that was not all. It was really a pity to be at
once so severe and so unjust to the colonies. The same report showed that there were
in New Caledonia 263,000 hectares of land ready for cultivation, suitable for cereals or
pasture, and that when these 4,000 men had received their land there would still be
212,000 hectares left for free colonisation. Now, although it must be acknowledged
that free colonisation from France had never reached the limits it had attained from
England, yet in Australia only two free colonists had gone for every five convicts sent
(et cependant vous voyez qu’en Australie, pour cinq formats ou cinq convicts, il ne se
rendait que deux colons libres). It might fairly be supposed, therefore, after allowing
for the difference in national habits and instincts, that there would be even a less pro-
portion of free colonists in New Caledonia. Well, if the Senate examined the programme
of works that had been indicated by the Government, one which was only the prelude
to future enterprises which the Committee had foreseen and which imagination could
easily suggest, it would be understood that individual transportation, that is to say the
sending there of recidivists belonging to classes whose aptitude had been proved for
certain trades corresponding with the demand for labour in the colony could only be a
means of progress and increase in wealth and prosperity. So much for New Caledonia.
As for Guiana, he [M. Waldeck-Rousseau] must make an even stronger protest against
what M. Berenger had said. [Here followed a mass of details about Guiana.] But
now as to the number of recidivists. M. Berenger had said there would be 10,000 the
first year, 20,000 the second, 30,000 the third; happily he had stopped at the fourth.
What the Government had done, on the contrary, was to subject the question for months
to a laborious and exhaustive investigation by directors of prisons and other most com-
petent authorities, bringing out at last the numbers which had been actually settled.
Their conclusions would be laid before the Senate before the debates closed. Meanwhile
what the Senate had to do first was to ask itself these two questions: had the relegation
of recidivists inexorably forced itself upon them ? and if so, how was it to be carried out ?
In the three years during which these long discussions of the subject had lasted there
had been two kinds of adversaries to the scheme. The first class objected to transporta-
tion altogether, as being contrary to social right and the rights of man ; they met the
question face to face and opposed a principle to a want. The other class were not less
dangerous; they did not say there should be no transportation at all, but they said that
some other method than transportation ought to be tried. It was to these that the
Senate would reply by now passing to the discussion of the clauses of the Bill.
The debate was resumed again next day (24th October), when M. Berenger replied
to M. Waldeck-Rousseau’s speech. Speaking of New Caledonia, he recalled to the
Senate the fact of the Governor’s having expressly declared that the colony could not
receive a single recidivist; but as it had been supposed to be absolutely necessary to name
some place, New Caledonia had been named, notwithstanding the fact that it was well
known to be impossible to send any there at all. He then went on to combat the
arguments used about transportation to Australia, and to compare, to the disadvantage
of the present Bill, his own Bill (now before the Chamber of Deputies) for preventing
relapse into crime, which, he said, had been inspired by the example of England in
her present criminal legislation and methods; but he denied that he was hostile to
transportation altogether.
M. Berenger was followed by M. de Yerninac, the Committee’s Reporter. For many
years past, he said, there had been a growing augmentation of crime of the minor type
(petite criminality ) in France; from 41,000 in 1830 the number had increased in 1882
to 153,000. But it was not merely this augmentation that was so formidable ; the worst
was the increase of relapsed and habitual criminals at a constant progression of 1 per cent,
per annum. Out of 55 reports of inquiries set on foot respecting the measure 47 had
been favourable, and all without exception agreed on one point, namely, the fear which
it had produced in the criminal classes. Some remedy must be sought for an evil that
was certain, undeniable, self-evident, imminent; and of all remedies transportation was
the only one that would be efficacious.
D 3


M. Schoelcher, as a former deputy from Guiana, spoke against the Bill.
M. Felix Faure, Under Secretary of State for the Colonies, followed. The two chief
questions asked by M. Berenger were, where the transportation would take place, and
what would be its cost. Now, the Government adhered to the figures of 5,000 recidivists
for the first year, 4,000 for the second, and 3,000 for the third. Phu Quoc had been
given up as unfit; the Marquesas had also been given up; but the Minister for the
Colonies had clearly shown that the Bill could be applied in the proportions of one-fifth
to New Caledonia and four-fifths to Guiana. The Government had also stated that the
one-fifth sent to New Caledonia would be under what was to be called “ individual
relegation.” The Government believed, and had been so advised by the best authorities,
that out of this class it would be possible to find a number desirous of working at their
trades and preferring to go separately to a colony rather than undergo the punishment
of what in Guiana was to be called “ collective relegation.” This class would be engaged
not only immediately on arrival, but (at any rate as to a large number of them) even before
departure. What was wanting equally in Guiana and New Caledonia was not room, but
labour; and the best proof of this was that only the other day the delegates from New
Caledonia, as well as Governor Pallu himself, had demanded the re-establishment of
recruiting in the New Hebrides. It was not without much apprehension that this request
had been granted, and if the steps taken in regard to it were found not to guarantee
sufficiently the rights of humanity, the Government might be obliged to recall their
authority; if so, New Caledonia would be seen asking for recidivists to a greater extent
than was proposed. New Caledonia was made a penal settlement in 1863, and from
Ist January 1864 it had been the practice to send convicts alternately there and to
Guiana until 1867, when only Arab or Asiatic criminals were sent to Guiana. The
reason for the change in 1867 had been that the climate of New Caledonia was so much
better than that of Guiana, and that, having to populate a new colony, it was easier to
transport convicts there than to find enough free colonists willing to go. There had
been no prompting of the reports of the Governors of either colony ; both the Governors
had been left free to advise according to their conscience. Then as to the cost of the
measure, the Government believed their estimates to be perfectly right; nothing had
been omitted, and the cost of police, troops, administration, and transport had been
given not only in the colony, but in France; and not only the first expense of the
establishments, but their maintenance in succeeding years. The problem before them
was certainly difficult, but the Government understood their responsibility; and they
wished to speak of things just as they were, or at any rate as they saw them, and to rest
only upon the most complete evidence in favour of a law which they believed to be not
only useful, but absolutely indispensable.
Admiral Fourichon, who had been Governor of Guiana in 1853-4, spoke strongly
against transportation. England had been forced to give it up, and why ? Because
when a free and moral European population, working, producing, exchanging, had once
established itseif, it had declared to the mother country that it would receive no more
convicts. .Transportation thereupon ceased, and the system perished by its own success.
Suppose the present scheme failed ? There would be misery of all kinds and a great
waste of money. One error had been widely disseminated and credited, that the Australian
Colonies owed their prosperity to transportation. He rejected this scheme absolutely;
there was no right solution of the problem but one, namely, that every country should
take care of its own criminals.
M. Milhet-Fontarable supported the Bill on the ground that the present system was
intolerable. It was no longer possible to keep the recidivists in France; they must be
sent to the colonies ; but the Committee had not thought right that particular colonies
should be designated. The Under Secretary (M. Faure) had said a great deal about
Guiana, but there were other colonies to which the recidivists could be sent. [Several
members here referred to Reunion, Guadeloupe, Madagascar, and Congo. M. Testelin
exclaimed, “ Make yourselves quite easy, there’ll be plenty for everybody.”]
The debate was renewed next day (25th October). Admiral Jaureguiberry said he
had been accused of being an enemy to all relegation ; this was not the case ; some law
to remove from France such criminals as gave signs of repentance and amendment
was both desirable and necessary. But such a law must be divested of all arbitrary
character, must be capable of being carried out, must not entail a cost out of proportion
to the object to be attained. The Bill before them did neither. The relegation was to
be compulsory, and the judges were to be compelled to sentence all recidivists to it,
whatever might be their character and antecedents. This compulsory feature of the
scheme had been greatly objected to in the Chamber of Deputies; its result would be


to exile for life many who had not really become a danger to society. Then as to the
clause providing for permits to leave the place of relegation, any conditions might be
sought for in vain in the Bill on which these permits were to be granted. Was the
criminal to be allowed to return to France ? The Bill said nothing on that point, and
discretion was left absolutely to the Governor of the Colony; now there ought to be no
place in such a measure for caprice. Another clause enabled the Government to give
recidivists within the colony all or some of the civil rights they had lost by their con-
victions, Under what conditions ? What proof of repentance or amendment was
required ? No one knew. The Government did not say what the 'regime was to which
the recidivists were to be subjected. According to what had passed in the Chamber of
Deputies, they were to be free, and certainly both law and justice were opposed to their
being detained as prisoners. Then what was to be done with them ? how were they to
be made to work ? If there were good reasons for not putting details on these points
into the law, at least the Government ought to state their own intentions. More than
a year had elapsed since the Chamber had passed the Bill, and it had even been a long
time before the Senate. Surely the Government could now divulge the leading features
of the regime , and say what the recidivists would be constrained to do, what their rights
would be, and how they were to be made to do any work. For after all it was very
difficult to admit n priori that the same men who would do nothing in France would
submit themselves with good will to work hard in a colony. The Senate ought to be
told what were the means proposed to make them work. The silence of the Government
was inexplicable ; there had been ample time to lay down the chief lines of the regulations
to be made. Then as to the place of relegation. Phu Quoc and the Marquesas being
given up, the Government had fallen back on New Caledonia and Guiana. He had
himself no serious objection to New Caledonia, for the climate was very healthy. Pro-
bably there would not be room for the 15,000 or 20,000 recidivists who would be sent
there in the course of a few years; but he [Admiral Jaureguiberry] thought the colony
might take about 2,000, on condition, however, that these were masons, carpenters,
locksmiths, and so forth, tradesmen who were wanted there and would be able to get
work. Indeed, if the colonists could be induced to give up some of the measures they
had adopted a larger number [than the 2,000] might perhaps be sent. Labour was so
much wanted in New Caledonia that the colonists had been compelled to recruit native
labour in the New Hebrides, But these natives had been nothing else than slaves under
the disguise of another name, and so much evil had resulted that the authority to recruit
had been withdrawn in 1882. The colonists had, in fact, been told that after all New
Caledonia was a penal colony, that they must submit to the conditions attached to that
type, and that they ought to employ, if not the convicts, at any rate the men who had
served their time ( liberes ). At that time there were 3,500 liberes absolutely idle, refusing
to do real work, who were housed and fed by the Government; there were no means of
making them work. They would work up to a certain point, but for this they asked
wages which the colonists could not pay. So the colonists had given them up, and
recruited for the labour in the New Hebrides. But so much disturbance had taken place
when New Caledonia had been recalled to its duty that lately the Government had been
obliged to yield and re-establish the New Hebrides recruiting. That was a great evil,
and if the colonists had been compelled to pay fair wages to the liberes, without allowing
them to have recourse to savages, who were all but slaves and had been brought from
the New Hebrides without knowing what they were doing, there would have been more
room for the recidivists now. Both the recidivists and the liberes must now be made to work,
yet Government was without any power whatever to compel either, although the liberes
were deemed much guiltier men than the recidivists for whom the Bill was intended.
So much for New Caledonia. He knew very well that a conquest of the New Hebrides
had been spoken of, in order to use the islands as a place for relegation or transportation ;
but they were tied by treaties which prohibited such a conquest, and besides there
would be many difficulties in the New Hebrides themselves. The Admiral then discussed
Guiana, which he also condemned as a place of relegation, and advised a reconsideration
of the proposed law.
M. de Lareinty said that every one seemed to think only of the scoundrels whom it
. was desired to get rid of, instead of the colonists who had carried the French flag to her
colonies. For his part he held that the money and solicitude of France ought to be
given to honest men, rather than be spent in providing country houses for every rogue
who was to be got out out of France. Let not the Senate deceive itself about the cost.
If they were prepared to spend what was really necessary to employ the men properly,
well and good. The colonies of France were not to be limited. It was all very well to
D 4


say that some were “ impossible; ” presently it would be seen how others were very
possible. They had now a great colonial expansion before them ; they were about to
conquer a portion of the world ; and they might have other places of relegation.
M. de Yerninac [Committee Reporter] criticised the last speeches, especially on the
compulsory character of the Bill. It was easy to give instances where the law would be
really severe. But i*. was not enough to fix the principle of a law ; the question was how
it was to be worked. Now for a criminal to incur relegation, there must have been,
except in certain cases, not only two, nor even three previous convictions, but four. And
for what offences ? theft, swindling, breach of trust, public outrage to modesty, excitation
of minors to debauchery. Could it be supposed that men who had four times committed
such offences were not really incorrigible ? Could they inspire much pity ? But, it
might be said, since these criminals were incorrigibles, the judges were sure to inflict the
relegation ; why, then, make it compulsory ? The answer was, that the only way to
make the law exemplary and useful was to inscribe in it the certainty that after a given
number of offences it would not depend on any one to prevent relegation. So long as a
hope was left to the criminal of escaping that fate, so long as he did not fear the certainty
of it coming to him, so long would he only use all the skill produced by prison life to
evade any repression at all.
M. Albert Grevy, Chairman of the Committee, felt it his duty, before the vote was
taken, to say that a minority in the Committee had never accepted the compulsory
principle; this minority was at first a majority; when they came to the deuxilme
deliberation , they would decide what course to take.
The Minister of the Interior [M. Waldeck-Rousseau] said that although at, their first
examination of the Bill as it came up from the Deputies, the Committee had been
inclined to a modification of the compulsory clause, he had himself insisted upon it as the
very kernel of the Bill.
Clause 1 (relegation to be compulsory for criminals of the specified classes) was then
put to the vote, when there appeared
For the clause - 141
Against - - - 38
Majority - - - 103
Clause 2 (relegation only to be inflicted by sentence of the ordinary courts) was
adopted after a short discussion.
Clause 3 (political offences not to incur relegation) passed without debate.
Clause 4 (specifying the classes of criminals) was adopted after a short discussion.
Clauses 5 to 12 (merely legal provisions) passed without debate.
The Clause as passed by the Chamber of Deputies, which specified New Caledonia,
Marquesas, Phu Quoc, and Guiana, as places of relegation, was struck out.
Clauses 13 (permits to be given to leave the colony) and 14 (penalty for return to
France or evasion of permit), then passed without debate, as well as the rest of the
Clauses 15 to 22 (legal provisions).
Lastly, the Senate resolved to pass to the deuxilme deliberation on a future day.

I hope I shall not be thought presuming if 1 venture to write to you officially on
a subject on which I feel I would rather not keep silence.
As you are aware, I was with Commander Acland, of H.M.S. “ Miranda,” for some
little time in the Banks Islands, and on one occasion acted as his interpreter during an
investigation which he conducted on the island of Santa Maria in that group, as to the
firing on the boats of the labour-vessel “ Flora.”
I was greatly struck by the combined patience and firmness with which he conducted
that investigation, and also generally by the kindly way in which he treated the natives
of the islands with whom he came in contact.

I feel sure that you will be glad to learn that this behaviour had the most marked
effect. The natives felt, and were not slow in expressing the feeling, that they could
implicitly trust the officers of H.M.’s ships, and while the} 7 recognised the restraining
force which was exerted over them, they recognised even more strongly the justice with
which it was exercised.
As I know that it is your wish that such a result should arise from the intercourse
of H.M.’s ships with the natives of the Western Pacific, I venture to bring under your
notice an instance of it, to which I can vouch from my own personal knowledge.

of the Recidivistes Bill was begun in the Senate yesterday.
The debate was opened by a speech from M; B6renger in favour of a Bill of his own
(a contre projet), which he moved as an amendment. It provided, not for the trans-
portation of recidivistes, but for an increase of the terms of imprisonment to which they
are liable.
M. Waldeck Rousseau, the Minister of the Interior, answered M. Berenger. He
dwelt much upon the almost unanimous call for the transportation of recidivistes which
was, he declared, made by the country.
He gave a short resume, from his own point of view, of the history of the transporta-
tion of convicts to Australia.
He maintained, in spite of a different calculation by the Minister of Justice, which had,
he said, been misunderstood, that the number of 5,000 represented about the maximum
of recidivistes to be transported even in the first years.
He postponed giving precise details as to the places to which the recidivistes would
be sent, and the discipline to which they would be subjected. He contradicted, however,
a report that Algeria or Corsica might be among the places chosen, and he went on to
say:
“ Si I’on veut bien adraettre qu’il ne faut pas etre plus attendri sur la destinee des
recidivistes que nous ne le sommes sur celle de nos nationaux, des representants denotre
armee et de tant d’autres personnes qui vont dans les colonies oh les recidivistes pour-
raient aller, on arrivera a trouver que ce ne sont pas des colonies qui nous manquent,
qu’il en est, h mon sens, d’absolument designees dhs maintenant. Non pas que je croie
que I’eieraent force, recidiviste puisse suffire a une colonization ; non.”
On the question of discipline he spoke as follows :
“ Mais je tiens a dire, parceque c’est en repetant que les transports seront la bas k
I’etat de liberte absolue qu’on a suscite des terreurs qui se comprennent fort bien dans
E 2


certaines colonies, je tiens k dire que je n’admets pas que les transports, une fois
envoyes soit k la Guyane, soit ailleurs y soient livrds k leur bon plaisir et sans surveill-
ance : qu’un convoi vienne jeter sur le rivage d’une de nos colonies 500, 1000, ou
1,500 rlcidivistes, sans que rien soit pret pour les recevoir, sans qu’il y ait une surveill-
ance organisee, sans qu’ils soient, en un mot, astreints a une certaine discipline.”
The Senate refused to refer M. Berenger’s contre-projet to the Committee, and the
debate on the second reading of the Recidivistes Bill itself was adjourned to the following
day (to-day).
I have the honour to enclose the authentic report of the debate of yesterday, which
has appeared in the “ Journal Officiel ” this morning.

Enclosure 2 in No. 15.
My Lord, Paris, February 8, 1885.
With reference to my Despatch of yesterday, I have the honour to inform
your Lordship that the debate on the Recidivistes Bill was resumed in the Senate on that
day and again adjourned.
I enclose the authentic report* of the proceedings, which appears in the “ Journal
Officiel ” this morning.
M. Labiche again raised the question of the unhealthiness of Guyane, and M. Buffet
opposed, the first Article on the ground that it bestowed on the Government powers
which ought to be more strictly defined and limited by the Legislature.
But the point practically discussed was whether the Government should be left free to
“ relegate” the recidivistes to any part of the French territory, or whether “ relegation ”
or “transportation” should be confined to French colonies or possessions abroad.
The Government themselves were in favour of the latter alternative, and the first
Article of the Bill was amended with a view to making it clear that recidivistes could
not be sent to France, Corsica, or Algeria. The amendment was carried by a very large
majority, and the Article, with a further amendment, was adopted.
The text before the Senate was that which appears in the third column at page 35 of
the report enclosed in my Despatch of the 3rd ultimo.
The Article as adopted yesterday was as follows :
Art. I. “ La relegation consistera dans rinternernent perpetuel sur le territoire des
“ Colonies ou possessions francaises des condaranes que la presente loi a pour objet
“ d’eloigner de France.
“ Seront determines par decrets rendues en forme de r6glement d’administration
publique, les lieux dans lesquels pourra s’effectuer la relegation, des mesures d’ordre et
de surveillance aux quelles les relegues pourront etre sounds par necessite de securite
publique, et les conditions dans lesquelies il sera pourvu a leur subsistance, avec obliga-
tion du travail a defaut de moyens d’existence dument constates.”
After the adoption of this Article the debate was adjourned to the next day but one
(Monday the 9th instant).
I have, &c.

Enclosure 3 in No. 15.
My Lord, Paris, February 10, 1885.
With reference to my Despatch of the day before yesterday, I have the honour
to transmit to your Lordship the authentic reportf of the proceedings in the Senate
yesterday with regard to the Recidivistes Bill.
* Not printed.


Articles 2 and 3 were passed as recommended by the Committee. They run as
follows:
Art. 2. “La relegation ne sera prononcee que par les cours et tribunaux ordi-
“ naires comme consequence des condamnations encourues devant eux, a I’exclusion de
“ toutes jurisdictions speciales et exceptionelles. Les cours et tribunaux pourront
“ toutefois tenir cornpte des condamnations prononcees par les tribunaux militaires et
“ maritimes en dehors de I’etat de sidge ou de guerre, pour les crimes ou debts de droit
“ comraun specifies a la presente loi.”
Art. 3. “ Les condamnations pour crimes ou debts pobtiques, ou pour crimes ou
“ debts qui leur sont connexes, ne seront, en aucun cas, comptees pour la relegation.”
The Senate refused to take into consideration an amendment moved by General
Robert to Art. 2, the object of which was to extend to the permanent courts martial
(conseils de guerre permanent des corps d’annee et des arrondissements maritimes) the
power of sentencing recidivistes to relegation.
On Article 4 being read, M. Labiche moved an amendment to the first paragraph,
with a view to leaving it to the discretion of the courts, in each case, to sentence, or not
to sentence, the recidivistes to relegation. The Reporter and the Minister of the
Interior contended that the penalty of relegation ought to be imposed by the law, and
not to be left to the discretion of the courts; and M. Labiche’s amendment was rejected
by 170 votes to 77-
The debate was then adjourned to the following day (to-day).

Her Majesty’s Government have carefully considered telegrams from Australian
Colonies, urging this country should contribute to New Guinea expenditure, and
inquiring extent British jurisdiction.
Her Majesty’s Government will not refuse to entertain question Imperial contribution,
recognising that German occupation of part of New Guinea contrary to wishes Colonies
may increase obligations and difficulties, also duty incumbent on Her Majesty’s
Government of protecting native interests may reduce local revenue, and thirdly,
decision proclaim sovereignty must increase cost establishment. Queen’s sovereignty
substituted for protectorate provides effective jurisdiction over foreigners and natives.
Power will be taken to legislate, establish courts and civil administration, as elsewhere in
British dominions. Large establishment seems quite unnecessary, but Colonial
Governments best able to advise as to extent and cost. I trust Colonial Governments
will without delay confer with Scratchley and consider with him what extent territory
inland should be annexed, and frame estimate probable annual cost, stating how proposed
to distribute and permanently secure contributions.
All should be settled before Scratchley goes out to New Guinea, as formal declaration
of sovereignty must be deferred until arrangements matured.

Recidivist Bill.
Notes of Debates in the French Senate on the Second Reading of the Bill, from
sth to 13th February 1885.
[Note. —It is impossible to give more than a mere sketch of a debate which extended over
six days, and travelled over the whole ground of the transportation question.
sth February.
M. Berenger renewed the arguments he had advanced in the debates of October 1884,
in favour of his scheme for combating relapse into crime, and criticised adversely the
whole scope of the present Bill. The evidence of the Governors of New Caledonia and
Guiana had now shown that it was impossible to send recidivists to New Caledonia, and
inhuman to send them to Guiana. The Committee had thereupon devised the idea of
leaving everything to the Executive. But to vote relegation, and then leave it in the
air: to acknowledge that it was impossible to say where it could be applied; to reject
every place one after the other as inadmissible; to do this, was a somewhat daring
imposition on serious men. The scheme would entail an enormous expense. It was
now clear that the estimate of the criminals to be transported must be doubled or
trebled. After reading the first 20 pages of the Report the decision seemed inevitable
against going on with the Bill. The Committee knew that there was no more to be
said about New Caledonia or Guiana, and that they could not maintain their former
opinions. They had practically renounced their scheme : they had even struck out the
word “ colony ” from the Bill; relegation was now to be simply defined as “internment.”
Internment where? The Minister might interpret the Bill in any sense he pleased.
No one had ever supposed that such colonies as Reunion or Martinique could be used,
still less any others that might be conquered or annexed hereafter; and who would dare
rora that tribune to suggest Tunis or Tonkin, or Corsica or Algiers ? Then as to
numbers and cost. The old figure of 5,000 had vanished ; they had now got to 21,000
as the lowest; but certain classes of criminals had yet to be counted in, and 30,000 was
the least number. The estimate had been 10,000,000 francs a year; they \vould find
30.000. too little. As to the exaction of forced labour, it really meant perpetual
imprisonment. That was again another innovation. But a penal law ought not to
sanction a punishment which it neither named nor defined. [M. Berenger then went on
to argue in favour of his own alternative scheme.]
M. Waldeck Rousseau (Minister of the Interior) replied to M. Berenger. The
Government still insisted on the necessity of the Bill. Public opinion demanded it, and
it was justified by the immense results produced by English transportation. He knew
there was a conflict of opinion about Australia. “ Convicts made Australia,” said some,
“ ruined her,” said otners. But it was only when Australia had become powerful and
flourishing that she refused to receive any more criminals. He only wished, for the
colonies of France -where recidivists were to be sent, that the same state of things
existed. As to numbers : the total number of recidivists, which had in 1856 been only
40.000, had risen to 75,000 in 1880, or nearly double; but 5,000 was still the probable
number that would come under relegation in the first years, for although there would
be some 20,000 criminals to be dealt with, only 5,000 would have to be relegated.
The great cities, Paris, Lyons, had been said to demand the Bill; but it was the country
folk who (though with Jess noise perhaps) demanded it most. The question of cost
must not stop the Senate ; but it had been overestimated, for the expense of recidivists,
if kept in France, must be taken into account. Then as to the place of relegation; he
admitted that an answer must be given to M. Berenger’s criticism. There could be no
question of choosing Corsica or Algiers. At a later period of the debate it would be
easy for him to show that it was not colonies that were wanting, for on the contrary
some could be immediately named. As to a regime of restraint, the reason for asking
that regulating powers should be given to the Executive, was that it would be futile to
lay down any programme at once ; the regime must be. one capable of easy modification,
very elastic, and subject to revision after experience. In like manner the exaction of
forced labour required a whole executive mechanism, which could not possibly find its
place in clauses of a Bill.


6th February. .
The debate was resumed by M. de Gavardie. The Bill had originated in the threat
of Gambetta at Belleville, “We shall know how to find you in your lairs.” The Bill
would cost 60,000,000 francs to carry out. Every jurisconsult of any authority, M. Lucas,
M. Desjardins, M. Picot, M. Chevrier, had pronounced against it. It was one that
could never be carried out. As to numbers : the Government estimate was 5,000, but
the Committee’s was now 21,000, and the Report went as high as 60,000. Even 60,000
was not certain; it might perhaps reach 100,000; it would certainly not be less than
24.000, and 30,000 was probably the lowest. The evidence of the Governor of Guiana
was alone sufficient to show that the scheme could never be carried out. As to the
cost, the Finance Committee had admitted the impossibility of estimating it even at
5.000, what would it be if the number was 30,000 ?
M. Schcelcher said that the fact of the Committee having proposed to strike out the
word “ colonies ” proved how questionable they thought the policy of choosing any
colonies at all for the relegation ; yet the Minister had said in yesterday’s debate that
it was precisely colonies that ought to be chosen. New Caledonia was already full.
Guiana was the only colony that could receive any of the recidivists, yet every one who
knew Guiana united in objecting to its being chosen. Throughout the debates in the
Chamber of Deputies it had been declared that the recidivists were to have absolute
liberty ; now the Minister had wisely renounced so baneful a proposal. Neither reason,
right, nor equity allowed the mother country to inflict such an evil upon her colonies.
New Caledonia objected as strongly as Guiana, and the delegate of that colony [ delegue
au Conseil Superieur des Colonies ] had protested in the name of the colonists, on the
ground that New Caledonia was already afflicted by the scourge of the liberes, and what
would become of it if to this scourge were added bands of incorrigible malefactors?
Why destroy colonies that were developing themselves gradually by free immigration ?
Why should not the recidivists be sent to the sparsely inhabited but fertile islands of the
New Hebrides ?
M, Labiche described the changes now proposed in the Bill. There had been
originally two fundamental conditions. The first was, that the recidivists should be left
in absolute liberty; it had been asserted in every page of M. Gerville-Reache’s Report,
and confirmed anew in the debates, especially by the Minister of the Interior [M.
Waldeck Rousseau] himself. The Committee had decided against leavitur the criminals
at liberty ; they had acknowledged it to be a Utopian idea to send 5,000, 10,000, 20,000,
30,000 criminals to a colony to be free. The silence of the Bill about the suppression
of that liberty did not permit it to be suppressed by mere executive regulation. As to
the argument that the prodigious development of Australian prosperity was due to
transportation, the contrary had been demonstrated. The hopes of the Minister of the
Interior were only generous illusions. Let the Senate study the Appendices to the
Committee’s Supplementary Report. The Minister had spoken of employing the
recidivists upon farms, in working forests, in keeping sheep. It was to be wished that
he had studied better the evidence and the documents laid before the Committee. The
recidivists would not be employed upon farms, for there were none; nor in keeping
sheep and cattle, for there were none; nor in any forestry work, for there was none. The
cardinal innovation now made by the Committee was the abolition of “ this state of
liberty.” There could be no doubt of what the Chamber of Deputies had intended;
he might recall the words of M. Gerville-Reache, and the articles published by M.
Leveille, but it was enough to quote the Minister’s own declaration, “ liberty was the
right of the relegues.’’ Upon this declaration the Chamber of Deputies had voted; it
was incontestable that the Chamber’s Bill was based upon it. Not being able, in face of
the evidence before them, to share the illusions of the Chamber the Committee had not
hesitated to say “ No more liberty,” and had expressly substituted for it a state of forced
labour. Now deprivation of liberty and exaction of forced labour were things too grave
to depend on mere executive regulation. The Committee did not prohibit relegation to
French colonies ; they contented themselves with not imposing it. As for the cost, the
most competent judges had told them that while it was easy to intern 1,000 men, the cost
must be tripled for 2,000, and multiplied ten times for 4,000.
M. de Yerninac (reporter) pointed out that the speech of M. Labiche was not an
explanation but a condemnation of the Bill; and M. Labiche must be understood as
having expressed his own individual opinions, not those of the Committee.
M. Waldeck Rousseau (Minister of the Interior) said that the course taken by the
debate made it necessary for the Government to give a clear explanation on several
points. The Committee proposed to enact in the first section of the Bill that relegation
was to consist in perpetual internment in some place not named. Then where was it to
u 16278. -P


be ? The Government wished to give a fair hearing to the protests of the colonies; but
the colonies had been told that 5,000 criminals were to be thrown on their shores in a
state of complete liberty, and that they were to be subject to an invasion of barbarians.
This was all mere misapprehension of the Bill. The criminals would be constrained to
work if they had no regular means of existence ; they would be subjected to a regime and
to control. As to the cost, the Government adhered to their estimates ; but even if the
expense were much greater it ought not to be an objection when compared with the
results to be attained, and the evil in face of which they all were. The Government
objected to any ambiguity of terms that would allow relegation to take place in France,
Corsica, or Algiers, and now asked the Senate to restore the condition that it should
take place in “colonies or other possessions.”
7th February.
M. Labiche renewed his arguments of the previous day,
M. Buffett said it was not necessary to be an expert in criminal law to show that the
Bill in its present shape ought not to pass. The Bill might be described in a few words
by saying that certain classes of habitual criminals were to be sent wherever it might
please the Government, and be subjected there to any regime the Executive might
think fit. Could that be called law ? The legislative power ought not to delegate to
the Executive the right of determining punishments or changing the Penal Code. What
right except that of force had the mother country to say to her colonies, “ I have so
many incorrigible malefactors, and I send them to you ” ? The colonists would be perfectly
right in replying, “We will not have them; we also have our crime ; let each of us keep
its own.” This was a grave question, which the legislative power ought to settle. Why
did it not do so ? It only needed to glance at the Committee’s Reports to see why.
No colony or territory was to be designated, simply because there was none to designate.
Whatever colony was mentioned, a crowd of peremptory objections presented themselves
against sending any recidivists there. So in order to get out of their embarrassment,
the Committee asked the Senate not even to indicate any place at all. Did the Govern-
ment know where they meant to send these criminals ? If they did, they could tell the
Senate as well to-day as the Council of State to-morrow. But if they did not know it
now, could the Senate be sure they would know it in another six months ? Surely here
was a first step which was essentially legislative, and ought not to be left to the
Executive. Then as to the regime : surely here again, relegation was a punishment
which might be light or severe according to the regime, and ought to be fixed by the
legislature. The Chamber of Deputies had said the recidivists were to be free ; and it
was this prospect of 30,000 criminals at liberty and in possession of common rights,
which had really alarmed the colonies, and would have provoked a revolt if they had
been strong enough for one. There were to be various classes of criminals, so that for
crimes of unequal guilt there was to be a uniform punishment of penal servitude for life
{travaux forces d perpetuite). But there were to be some from whom this forced labour
was not exacted. Were these to be the most (least?) guilty? No, they were to be men
who had some personal resources. Now it was revolting to argue that the least guilty
might be treated more hardly than the most, merely because the latter had private means.
M. Laroze (Under Secretary of State for the Interior) defended the Government.
M. Berenger pointed out that the Minister of the Interior had now given a precise
definition to the term “ colonies ”; it was only to mean Guiana.
M. Waldeck Rousseau (Minister of the Interior) ; Chiefly ( notamment ) Guiana.
M. Berenger : “ Chiefly ” : but as it had been abundantly demonstrated that there
was no other colony possible, the Senate would understand the true signification of the
present vote to be the adoption of Guiana. But under the Empire they had been obliged
to give up transportation to Guiana; and the sole question now was whether the Republic
of 1885 would do what the Empire of 1868 had abandoned.
The President then explained the question to be voted upon, being the first paragraph
of Clause 1.
Clause 1 of the original Bill, as passed by the Chamber of Deputies, was that “ relega-
“ tion should consist in the perpetual internment within French colonies or possessions of
“ the convicts which it was the object of the law to remove from France.” The Senate
Committee proposed to amend this by providing that relegation should consist “in the
“ perpetual internment of the criminals to whom the law was to be applicable” ;
The Senate divided
For the Committee clause - 15
Against - 22 7
Majority against - - - 212


The President then put the first paragraph of the clause, in the shape passed by the
Chamber of Deputies. The Senate divided : —
Ayes - 182
Noes ------ 39
Majority - - - 143
The other two paragraphs of the clause, as proposed by the Senate Committee
(Executive regulations to decide the place of relegation and the regime of enforced
labour) were then agreed to, and Clause 1 passed as amended.
9th February.
Clause 2 (relegation to be by sentence of tribunals) passed after a short debate
respecting military sentences.
Clause 3 (political crimes excluded) agreed to.
On Clause 4 (classes subject to relegation) M. Labiche moved an amendment
leaving a discretion to the judges to inflict relegation. The amendment was strongly
supported by M. de Pressens6, but rejected by M. Waldeck Rousseau. The Senate
divided:—
For the amendment - - - -77
Against - 170
Majority - - - 93
10 th February.
The debate was resumed on Clause 4. Ultimately part was agreed to and the remainder
referred back to the Committee.
Clause 5 (formerly 6, commuted sentences) agreed to.
Clause 6 (limit of age) agreed to.
Clause 7 (new clause, relegation not to release from army) agreed to.
Clause 8 (provisions respecting age) postponed.
Clause 9 (certain sentences to count) agreed to.
Clauses 10 to 17 (legal provisions) agreed to.
Next clause (sentences under law of 1854) negatived.
Clause 18 (formerly 19, executive regulations to be made) agreed to with amend-
ment.
Clauses 19 and 20 (legal provisions) agreed to.
Clause 21 (formerly 20, law to come into force on promulgation of first regulation)
agreed to.
Clause 22 (formerly 23, repeal of provisions contrary to Bill in other Acts) agreed to.
New Clause 23 (a report to be made to President of Republic on working of law)
agreed to.
13 th February.
The Senate resumed the consideration of Clause 4 ; put as a whole and agreed to.
Also Clause 8 (postponed) agreed to.
On the question that the Bill as amended be agreed to, the Senate divided :—

My Lord, Paris, February 7, 1885..
With reference to my Despatch of yesterday, I have the honour to inform
your Lordship that the debate on the Recidivistes Bill was resumed in the Senate
yesterday, and after having occupied the whole sitting was adjourned to this day.
I have the honour to enclose the authentic reportj of the proceedings.
Speeches were made by M. de Gavardie, M. Schoelcher, M. Emile Labiche, by the
Reporter, M. de Verninac, and by the Minister of the Interior, M. Waldeck Rousseau,
M. de Gavardie condemned the Bill altogether.
M. Schoelcher objected to the recidivistes being sent either to Guyane or to New
Caledonia, or other French colonies, and he insisted particularly on the unhealthiness of
Guyane.
M. Emile Labiche contended that the recidivistes might be placed in penitentiaries
on certain points of French territory other than the Colonies, and observed, that, in fact,
the Bill as it stood, left this in the power of the Government.
M. de Verninac, the Reporter of the Committee, maintained that the majority of that
body were of opinion that transportation both to Guyane and New Caledonia was feasible,
and he denied the unhealthiness of the former,
M. Waldeck Rousseau, the Minister of the Interior, also disputed the accuracy of the
statements of the extreme unhealthiness of Guyane. He again gave details of the
history of transportation in Australia.
He said that the Government had determined to support an amendment which would
make it clear that the recidivistes could be transported or “ relegated ” only to French
colonies or possessions, or, in other words, that they could not be “ relegated ” to
France, Algeria, or Corsica.

Enclosure 2 in No. 28.
My Lord, Paris, February 11, 1885.
With reference to my Despatch of yesterday, I have the honour to transmit
to your Lordship the authentic report* of the proceedings in the Senate yesterday
respecting the Recidivistes Bill.
The Article considered first was No. 4, which defines the conditions under which
criminals become subject to relegation. The greater part of it was adopted, but it was
nevertheless referred back to the Committee, in order that some modifications, which
had been proposed, might be reported upon.
Articles 5, 6, and 7 were adopted.
Article 8 was postponed.
Articles 9» 10, and 11 were adopted.
Article 12 was adopted, the word “ agricole ” being struck out after “ penitencier ” in
the second paragraph; and the words “ pendant trois mois au plus a I’expiration dc
“ leur peine ” being struck out at the end.
I should, perhaps, here repeat that the text before the Senate is that which appears
in the third column of the Projet de loi, pages 35 to 4 4 of the Report of the Com-
mittee which was enclosed to your Lordship in my Despatch of the 3rd ultimo.
After the adoption of Article 12 yesterday, the debate was adjourned to the next day
but one (to-morrow).

Enclosure 3 in No. 28.
My Lord, Paris, February 13, 1885.
With reference to my Despatch of the 11th instant, I have the honour to transmit
to your Lordship the authentic report* of the proceedings in the Senate yesterday
relating to the Recidivistes Bill.
Articles 13 to 17 were adopted.
These five Articles all bear upon the safe custody of the relegucs, and consequently
upon the security afforded against their becoming a danger to foreign countries within
reach of the places of relegation. It may, therefore, be convenient for me to insert here
the text of these Articles as adopted.
“Art. 13. Le r6l6gue pourra momentanement sortir du territoire de relegation en
vertu d’une autorisation speciale de I’autorite superieure locale.
“Le Ministfe seul pourra donner cette autorisation pour plus de six mois, ou la
reitdrer.
“II pourra seul autoriser h titre exceptionnel et pour six mois au plus, le relegud a
rentrer en France.”
“ Art. 14. Le relegud qui a partir de I’expiration de sa peine, se sera rendu coupable
d’evasion, ou de tentative d’dvasion, celui qui, sans autorisation, sera rentrd en France,
ou aura quittd le territoire de relegation, celui qui aura outre pass 6 le temps fixe par
I’autorisation sera traduit devant le tribunal correctionnel du lieu de son arrestation, ou
devant celui du lieu de relegation, et apres reconnaissance de son identity sera puni
d’un emprisonnement de deux ans au plus.
“En cas de recidive cette peine pourra etre portee a cinq ans. Elle sera subie sur le
territoire de relegation.”
“ Art. 15. En cas de grfice, le a la relegation ne pourra en etre dispense
que par une disposition speciale des lettres de grace.
“ Cette dispense par voie de grace pourra d’ailleurs intervenir meme aprhs I’expiration
de la peine principale.”
“ Art. 16. Le relegue pourra, a partir de la sixietne annee de sa liberation, introduce,
devant Je tribunal de la localite, une demande tendant a se faire relever de la relegation,
en justifiant de sa bonne conduite des services rendus a la colonisation et de moyens
d’existence.
“ Les formes et conditions de cette demande seront deferminees par le reglernent
d’administration publique prtjvu par I’Article 19 ci-apr£s.”
*|Not printed.


“Art. 17. Le Gouvernment pourra accorder aux relegues I’exercise sur les territoires
de relegation de tout ou partie des droits civils dont ils auraient ete prives par I’effet des
condamnations encourues.”
Article 18 was struck out.
The number 18 was in consequence affixed to the Article numbered 19 in the projet.
Some words in the first paragraph having been struck out, the Article as passed ran as
follows:
“ Art. 18. Des regleinents d’administration publique determineront les conditions dans
lesquelles ils accompliront les obligations militaires auxquelles ils pourraient etre soumis
par les lois sur le recrutement de I’arraee.
“ L’organisation des penitenciers mentionnes en I’Article 12.
“ Les conditions dans lesquelles le condamne pourra etre dispense provisoirement ou
definitivement de la relegation pour cause d’infirmite ou de maladie, les mesures d’aide
et d’assistance en faveur des rel6gu6s ou de leurs families, les conditions auxquelles des
concessions de terrains provisoires ou definitives pourront leur etre accorddes, les avances
a peine s’il y a lieu pour premier etablissement, le mode de reraboursement de ces avances,
I’etendue des droits de I’epoux survivant, des heritiers ou des tiers interesses sur les
terrains concedes et les facilites qui pourraient etre donnes a la famille des relegues
pour les rejoindre.
“ Les conditions des engagements de travail a exiger des relegues.
“ Le regime et la discipline des etablissements ou chantiers, ou ceux qui n’auraient ni
moyen d’existence ni engagement seront astreints au travail.
“ Et en general, toutes les mesures necessaires a assurer P execution de la presente loi.
“ Le premier reglement destine a organiser I’application de la presente loi sera promulgue
dans au ddlai de six mois ou plus a dater de sa promulgation.”
The Articles bearing Nos. 20, 21, and 22 in the projet were adopted with the necessary
changes of number.
The Senate also adopted a new Article providing that a report on the execution of the
law should be made annually by the proper Minister to the President of the Republic.
It was agreed that the discussion of Article 4 which had been, postponed, and of an
additional Article moved by General Robert, should take place at an early sitting, the
precise date of which was not fixed.

With reference to my Despatch of yesterday, I have the honour to inform your
Lordship that the debate in the Senate on the Recidivistes Bill was concluded yester-
day, and that the Bill was passed by a majority of 178, the numbers being 198 to 20.
I have the honour to enclose the authentic report* of the proceedings.
The text of Article 4, which had been reserved, was modified and finally settled.
Article 8, which had been postponed, was adopted.
Some verbal and formal corrections were agreed to.
I will send your Lordship a correct copy of the Bill as passed by the Senate, as soon
as I am able to get one.
The Bill sent up by the Chamber of Deputies has, as your Lordship will have
observed, been so much modified by the Senate as to have become in fact almost a new
Bill.
It will now go back to the Chamber with the Senate amendments; and it is not
certain that all those amendments will be agreed to.

With reference to your Excellency’s remarks at the meeting of the Executive Council

We concur with the other Colonies in protesting.”
The wording of the protest this Government is in no way responsible for, and it will
be observed we anticipated “ the other Colonies ” would have joined before it was sent
from Victoria.
At the same time this Government desires that it should be distinctly understood
that it firmly adheres to the opinion which it had every reason to believe, from the
Secretary of State’s utterances, was shared by the Imperial Government, that
annexation by any Foreign Power of any portion of New Guinea must be prejudicial to
the interests of Australasia.

In consequence of General Scratchley’s very short stay at King George’s Sound, it
was not possible for me to have any communication with him upon this matter, except
interchange of telegrams.
In connexion with this subject, I beg to be allowed to inform your Lordship that on
the 16th of December last, I received from his Excellency the Governor of New South
Wales, the following copy of a telegramJ forwarded by your Lordship to his
Excellency.
By the last mail from Sydney, I received a copy of the Proclamation establishing a

THE AGENTS-GENERAL FOR THE AUSTRALIAN COLONIES AND NEW
ZEALAND to COLONIAL OFFICE.
My Lord, London, February 25, 1885.
In compliance with your Lordship’s desire, we beg now to place before you in
writing the representations we made to you at our interview of the 18th instant, on the
subject of the Recidivist Bill.
It will be in your Lordship’s recollection that, at the interview with which you
honoured some of us on the 19th November last, we traced the changes that had been
made in the Bill, from the time when it passed the Chamber of Deputies in June 1883,
to its first reading in the Senate in October 1884. The scheme had recommended itself
to the Chamber of Deputies by four leading features. The Colonies to which the
recidivists were to be transported were expressly named : France was to be rid of 60,000
or even 80,000 of her most dangerous criminals : this riddance was to be effected at a very
small cost: and the recidivists were to be absolutely free on their arrival in the Colony.
Your Lordship will remember that this last feature seemed so incredible to you, that you
required the Agent-General for New Zealand to supply you with clear evidence of it,
which was at once supplied, and has since been abundantly verified in the Senate debates.
The Bill as it left the Chamber of Deputies was largely amended at its first reading in
the Senate last October. All the leading features of the original scheme were reversed.
The names of the Colonies were struck out: transportation was to be limited to Guiana
and New Caledonia : instead of 60,000 or 80,000 recidivists, there were only to be
12.000 : instead of the scheme costing little, the estimate for the first three years was to
exceed 1,000,000/.: lastly, instead of the recidivists being free, they were to be under
effectual restraint, and be liable to forced labour. These changes reflected one which was
not less significant in French public opinion. There had always been serious objections
to the Bill in France ; but in the interval between the passing of the Bill in the Chamber
of Deputies and tis coming up to the Senate, these objections had been so powerfully
urged, especially in regard to the “state of liberty,” that the Government had been
obliged to defer to them.
The Bill had only got as far as the first reading in the Senate,when the session was
prorogued. In the interval between the prorogation and the re-assembling of the Chambers
in January, the Senate Committee re-investigated the whole subject: and they presented
an elaborate supplementary report, by which the character of the Bill was again to be
largely modified. They admitted that grave doubts now existed whether it was possible
to carry out the law at all, for want of any Colony where the “ relegation ” could take
place. They allowed that the evidence laid before them had established the fact of there
being no more room in New Caledonia, where there were already 10,000 convicts, and
3.000 liberes who had to be supported by the State for want of work. The late Governor,
M. Pallu de la Barriere, declared in emphatic terms that New Caledonia could not receive
any recidivists. They would not be able to find work any more than the liberes. There
were no industries in the Colony, and the liberes furnished more workmen than were
wanted; while the free Colonists would always prefer recruits from the New Hebrides at
45 francs per month, or forgats at 65 francs, to liberes who would not work under 8 to 10
francs a day. The relegues would require the same wages, though they would be more
dangerous and less apt to work than the forgats ; and if they did not get work they would
perforce come back to the State, as the liberes did, for sustenance. As to concessions of
land, what remained qf the State Domain would barely suffice, up to 1888, for the con-
cessions to liberes required by the Law of 1854, or for the free emigration which was the
indispensable counterpoise of any scheme of transportation : so that in order to allow of
any concessions being made to the relegues at all, either transportation must very soon

G 2


cease, or the allocation of land to free Colonists must come to an end, which meant the
ruin of the Colony. The Governor of Guiana, M. Chesse, advanced a sustained and
powerful argument against the whole scheme of relegation as originally proposed, and
especially against the relegues being free on arrival : he warned the Government that
although the cost of the scheme might begin at a few hundred thousand francs, it would
soon have to be counted by millions : he showed that out of 22,000 convicts transported
to Guiana since 1854, perhaps 10 liberes might be counted as having established them-
selves, and even these were all old soldiers who had nothing about them of the forgat but
the name : and he then went on to propose a rigorous system of restraint, under which he
thought relegation might be possible, provided the law itself laid down that every rclegue
who did not get his own living should be held to forced labour, and subjected to military
jurisdiction and discipline. M. Schoelcher, a Member of the Senate and Vice-President
of the Conseil Sup6rieur des Prisons, presented protests from Guiana and New Caledonia,
continuing all that the Governors of those Colonies had said. New Caledonia has no
representative in the French Parliament: but its delegate to the Conseil Superieur des
Colonies entreated the Government of the mother country, after having inflicted upon
the Colony one scourge in the liberes , not to inflict another yet worse in the relegues.
The Senate Committee confirmed the evidence of the Governor of New Caledonia.
After a renewed and exhaustive study of the question, showing that there was really no
Colony in which it could be said with certainty that the law could be safely put in force,
they advised the Senate to leave the choice of territory entirely to the Government,
They admitted that the possession of absolute liberty and common rights by incorrigible
malefactors, constituted a peril so great that the law could never have been really carried
out. They showed that the number spoken of at the first reading of the Bill in October
1884 must be now largely increased. According to the earlier returns, they had been
willing to accept the estimate of 5,000 for the first year, 4,000 for the second, and 3,000
for the third : but a later return supplied to them by the Minister of Justice showed that
not less than 30,000 would have come under the original Bill, and 21,000 under the
present one. It was argued within the Committee that even this number might turn out
to be much less than the reality ; that the growing augmentation of recidive had not been
taken into account ; that sentences of military and naval tribunals entailing relegation had
been altogether left out; that various offences had also been omitted ; that in addition
to the 30,000 who would come immediately under the law, there were large numbers
whom previous sentences would place in the same category ; that there were really more
than 60,000 on whom a fresh sentence would entail relegation ; and that it was not 12,000,
but perhaps 30,000, who would have to be relegated in the first three years. The Com-
mittee admitted that the 21,000 indicated by the Minister must be very much increased.
They did not pretend that there was any more than an approximate estimate of the
number to be relegated. All they would say was that “it was not impossible to admit
that the Government estimate approached the truth.” Nevertheless, they still urged
that the greater was the number, the greater was the gravity of the peril to society, and
the clearer the necessity for the Bill.
The debate on the second reading extended from the sth to the I3th February, The
Bill was denounced by several senators in unmeasured terras : but the Minister of the
Interior (M. Waldeck-Rousseau) repeated the official arguments as to the absolute
necessity of transportation, and announced the determination of the Government to go
on with the scheme in Guiana. In none of the speeches was any attempt made to meet
the objections to its application to New Caledonia. A general feeling, indeed, seems to
have arisen that the Ministers had given up New Caledonia, and an endeavour was made
to pin the Government to this, on the ground that it was now impossible to mistake
M. Waldeck-Rousseau’s meaning, and that for the term “ Colonies ” the Senate must read
“ Guiana onlybut the Minister would only say it was to be chiefly Guiana {notamment
la Guy an e).
The Senate was evidently determined to pass the Bill in some shape, and on a division
the second reading was carried by the large majority of 178. But everything was left
to the Executive; the place of relegation, the numbers to be sent, the regime to be
applied, and the cost. All this was to be fixed by executive regulation; six months
being allowed to the Government for promulgating the first regulation, after which the
law was to come into force.
It is at this stage that we have ventured to ask your Lordship to make another appeal
to the French Government before the Bill goes back to the Chamber of Deputies. We
have more than once acknowledged the obligations of the Colonies to Her Majesty’s
Ambassador at Paris for the manner in which he hgs so often pressed their wishes upon
M. Ferry; and we hope Lord Lyons may see, in the present state of the Bill, a fair


opportunity for renewing his efforts, and inducing the Trench Ministers to concede what
Australasia so earnestly desires. There can no longer' be a pretence that New
Caledonia is able to take any recidivists. Surely it would be a wanton thing to send
them there now in the face of the evidence that lias come to light, and of the repeated
protests of the Erench Colonists themselves. In the confident hope that their own
reiterated remonstrances would not be always rejected by a great and friendly nation,
the English Colonies have refrained as yet from passing those measures of self-protection
to which the Imperial Government has acknowledged that assent could not now be
refused. They desire nothing better than to live in amity with the Trench settlers, and
to see the Trench Colony flourish. The Government ef the Republic can now do what
the free Colonists of both nations alike have asked, without giving up the point which
M. Terry refused to yield : and the change in the structure of the Bill, which leaves
absolute power to the Executive, may enable a friendly understanding to be come to
that New Caledonia should not be chosen for the relegation, without derogating in any
way from the honour or the dignity of Trance.
We have, &c.

the honour to draw your Excellency’s attention to the very significant popular movement
on the subject now in progress.
1. The Mayor of Melbourne (Mr. G. D. Carter) in response to a requisition from a
number of citizens of good repute and standing convened a meeting, which was held in
the town hall on the 7th instant. This meeting formed one of the most weighty public
demonstrations ever held in the Colony. In point, of numbers, the large hall, estimated
to hold 4,000 persons, was not only filled, hut many hundreds of persons were
unable to obtain admission. The meeting, while expressly loyal, was earnest, enthusiastic,
and unanimous. The resolutions arrived at Mr. Service has the honour to submit here-
with to your Excellency.
2. On the same day a meeting estimated to be about the same in numbers was held in
Ballarat, a copy of the resolutions passed is enclosed herewith. Similar meetings have
taken place at Rosedale and Caraperdown, and more arc announced to be held,

3. Resolutions of much the same tenour have been passed by the Councils of th e
following Municipal bodies;—
City of Fitzroy.
Town of Warrnambool.
Shire of Avon.
Shire of Narracan.
Shire of Wimmera.
A copy of these Resolutions is also enclosed. It is probable that this expression of
sentiment by municipal bodies will extend and become general.
4. A huge number of articles extracted from the Melbourne and the country news-
papers expressing the popular feeling on the subject are likewise enclosed.
Mr. Service has the honour to request that your Excellency will be so good as to
transmit these documents to the Right Honourable the Secretary of State for the
Colonies.

Premier.
Resolutions adopted at a meeting of the citizens of the city of Melbourne, held
at the Town -Hall, Melbourne, on 7th January 1885, to protest against foreign
annexation in New Guinea and the islands of the Western Pacific.
1. That this meeting, while asserting its unswerving loyalty to the Crown, is of
opinion that the islands of the Western Pacific have been brought into prominence, and
made of commercial, political, and strategic value by the energy and enterprise of British
subjects in Australia and New Zealand; that their occupation by Australians is essential
to Australasian unity, and that any imperial action whereby these islands may be lost to
the Colonies would be unjust and calculated to endanger public faith in the wisdom,
patriotism, and firmness of the Home Government.
2. That this meeting protests in the strongest terms against any action, either on the
part of the British or any other Government, the tendency or result of which would be
to pollute the islands of the Pacific in the vicinity of Australia with cnminals from any
part of Europe, and respectfully but firmly asks the British Government to take such
steps as will effectually prevent such a calamity.
3. That the chairman of this meeting be empowered to forward a copy of the fore-
going resolutions to Mr. James Service, the Premier, for transmission, through his Excel-
lency, to the Imperial Government, with the assurance that the Victorian Government
may rely upon the unanimous and hearty support of the people in any action they may
take to secure the object in view, viz,, the annexation of those islands to the dominion of
Australasia.
City of Ballarat and Town of Ballarat East.
Resolutions passed at a Public Meeting held at Ballarat on Wednesday, the 7th January
1885, re German annexation at New Guinea, the Mayor of the city presiding.
1. That this meeting views with alarm the growing tendency on the part of foreign
Powers to seize upon islands adjacent to Australia, and affirms as its opinion that the
islands of Australasia should become the inheritance of Australians alone.
2. That this meeting desires to express its hearty approval of the action taken by the
Honourable the Premier of Victoria in protesting on behalf of the Colony against Lord
Derby’s injudicious policy in dealing with matters of vital interest to Australasia.
3. That a copy of the foregoing resolutions, signed by the mayors, be forwarded to
the Honourable James Service, Premier of Victoria, for transmission to the Home
authorities.

Chairman of Meeting.
Resolution of Warrnambool Town Council.
Forwarded to Premier Bth January 1885.
That this Council, representing the people of the town of Warrnambool, view with
great pleasure the untiring energy you have evinced in promoting the federation of the


Colonies, and they desire to express their highest appreciation of the patriotic stand you
have taken in endeavouring to prevent the annexation of New Guinea, or neighbouring
islands, by any foreign Power; and they are sure that it should be the aim and interest
of all these Colonies to federate, and of those at home, wielding the affairs of the State,
to endeavour while giving liberty to each portion to regulate tiieir own affairs at the same
time to combine the whole of the English-speaking race under the British Government
into one grand concentrated mighty nation.
Resolution unanimously carried at meeting of Avon Shire Council, January 5, 1885.
That this Council desires cordially to support the energetic action of the Honourable
the Premier in his endeavour to prevent the alienation of any part of the island of New
Guinea, the inhabitants of the Australian Colonies having been given to understand that
it was secured from the interference of any foreign Power.
Resolution passed at meeting of Narracan Shire Council, on January 3, 1885.
That this Council warmly approve of the action of the Premier, the Honourable
James Service, in protesting against the conduct of Lord Derby in allowing Germany to
annex any portion of New Guinea, and trusts that he will not relax his energies until
the whole of New Guinea and the other islands lying adjacent to the Australian conti-
nent be placed under the British Crown.
Shire of Wimmera.
Shire Offices, Horsham,
Sir, January 8, 1885.
I have the honour, under direction of the Wimmera Shire Council, to inform you
that it heartily approves of the course followed by you in protesting against the action
of Lord Derby in allowing the German Government to annex a portion of New Guinea,
and the Shire Council is further of opinion that under no consideration whatever should
the New Hebrides and the adjacent islands be allowed to be taken possession of by
any foreign power, but that immediate action should be taken by the British Govern-
ment to annex these islands in the interests of the peace and prosperity of the people and
of the Australian dominion.
I have, &c.

GOVERNOR THE RIGHT HON. LORD AUGUSTUS LOFTUS, G.C.B. (NEW SOUTH
WALES), to the HON THE EARL OF DERBY,K.G.
(Received February 27, 1885.)
My Lord, Sydney, January 20, 1885.
I had the honour to receive on the sth instant your Lordship’s telegram of the
3rd instant* informing me that the German annexation in New Guinea had not been
made in concert with Her Majesty’s Government, and that communications were now
taking place with the German Government on the subject.
■ 2. I immediately communicated this telegram to Mr. Dailey and my Ministry, and
they have decided to await the result of the communication with the German Govern-
ment before taking further, action in urging the retrocession of the northern part of New
Guinea annexed by Germany.
3. There appears to be some reaction ,in South. Australia and Queensland in
regard to the policy of Mr. Service, notwithstanding the opinion expressed by Sir
Thomas Mcllwraith at a public ‘ banquet at Brisbane, a- report- of which- is - given in
* No. 108 in [C. —4273] February 1885.
G 4


the annexed article* from the “ Evening News ” of Sydney, and a wish to support New
South Wales in the more moderate and judicious course taken by Messrs. Stuart and
Dailey, But there is still a feeling here of deep disappointment that any portion of New
Guinea should have been annexed by a foreign Power after the assurances that had
been given that no such annexation was to be apprehended.
4. Dissatisfaction is generally felt and strongly expressed by the press of this Colony
at the instructions given to General Scratchley, which clearly indicate that the Imperial
Government are not prepared to bear any portion of the expenses for the Protectorate of
New Guinea and the adjacent islands. It is urged that the Colonies had no idea that
they were to bear the whole expense of the Protectorate, and, as it were, to support an
exercise of Imperial authority by a Commissioner who was alone responsible to the
Imperial Government. Under these circumstances, and the general feeling of dissatis-
faction in all the Colonies, I do not think that General Scratchley will succeed in raising
funds for carrying on the important duties with which he is charged.
5. As I informed your Lordship in ray telegram of the 2nd instant* severe attacks
against this Government and censure of the policy of Messrs. Stuart and Dailey were
being daily made by the press of this Colony, and mixed with it there has been much
dangerous and inflammatory talk about Germany, which was calculated to do much
mischief both now and hereafter.
6. Mr. Dailey felt it desirable to counteract these influences, and he accordingly
profited of the opportunity of a public dinner at Maitland to make a remarkable speech,
with a view to enlighten the public mind on the whole subject of these annexations,
arid to soften the attacks which had been so impetuously addressed against Her Majesty’s
Government and Germany. , I have the honour to enclose a copy of Mr. Dailey’s speech,
and to express a hope that it may be widely promulgated in England and Germany.
7. In respect of the financial question I have advised my Government to take the
initiative in submitting to the Premier of Victoria and to the other Colonial Govern-
ments a proposal to supplement the original grant of 15,000/., by a sufficient sum to
enable General Scratchley to enter on his duties in a suitable manner, worthy of the
country he represented. I have frankly stated that the Colonies have been urgently
demanding this “ plum,” and when they obtain it they decline to pay for it. They
cannot expect that the British taxpayers are to be burthened in order to gratify a
sentimental ambition on the part of the Colonies. I observed that they had obtained
all that can possibly be of any use to them, and they were bound collectively to. con-
tribute their full share of expense towards the maintenance and development of what
they thought was their inheritance.
8. Mr. Dailey replied that the great dissatisfaction felt at the arrangements concerning
the Protectorate will prevent this Government from taking the course I had suggested.
He observed that hoAvever anxious to assist Her Majesty’s Government (and this desire
had been manifested in a remarkable degree), this Government could do nothing which
the Legislature has not sanctioned and which they had reason to believe it would not
sanction. He said it had been clearly understood that the Colonies were only to con-
tribute a fixed sum to the maintenance of the Protectorate ; and it was never suggested
that the Imperial Government was to be wholly relieved from contribution. Now an
Imperial officer had been sent out on a national employment responsible only and
necessarily to the Imperial Government, the expenses of whose establishment are to be
defrayed by contiibutions from Governments which have no kind of control or direction
of the authority to be exercised.
9. Such is the general disposition which General Scratchley will meet with from all
the Colonies, and I cannot possibly see how he can suitably reach New Guinea, much
less commence the establishment of some sort of government, with the meagre allowance
granted by the Colonial Governments.
10. General Scratchley is expected in a few days at Sydney and it is possible that he
may impart to my Government information in regard to his future proceedings which
may be of a satisfactory nature.
11. I enclose to your Lordship various articles* from the Sydney press and comment-
ing on Mr. Dailey’s speech on the German annexation.
I have, &c.

Enclosure in No. 36.
Speech delivered at Maitland, at a Banquet to tbe Ministry, on Tuesday, the 13th
of January, 1885, by the Hon. William Bede Dalley, Q.C., M.L.C., Attorney-
General and Acting Colonial Secretary of New South Wales.
Mr. Dailey, said; Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen, —Fresh from a great welcome at an
hospitable gathering of the citizens of Sydney, we almost commence our vacation, —
which 1 may tell you in secret will be a long one, and bear a very reasonable proportion
to the toils by which our holiday has been fairly won—by appearing in this great town
at this entertainment. We are prepared, gentlemen, for many of these enjoyments, not
the least pleasing part of which is that we are brought face to face with our friends, and
are enabled to give into their keeping through the press our confidences and proposals.
Gentlemen, it is rather early just now to whisper to you of a policy which we intend to
carefully mature by slow and laborious exertions. Some months later we shall speak
of these things. At present we have that delicious feeling of intoxication which springs
from the consciousness of a long and deserved holiday. We are intellectually unequal
to face just now those matters which will engage our best attention when we are tired
of those pleasures from which we have been so long estranged. We have been on such a
dreary voyage, so long tempest-tossed, so rarely seeing land, and having, when we did
catch sight of it, only glimpses of reefs and perils, that noiv the anchor is down, the
sails furled, and the freight discharged, we are due for a long run ashore. You will
hear of us in various places enjoying ourselves, perhaps unwisely, as men often do who
have not tasted happiness for a long time. But you will temper your severity in judging
of our extravagance by remembering that we have long been strangers to the ordinary
pleasures of human life. All of us have laboured hard, some of us have suffered, two
or three of us have fallen in the conflict.; the ablest and best of us, who worked so hard,
so well, so unselfishly, tell just as the victory was assured. It would be unpardonable
on our part who are here present to accept this proof of your appreciation of our poor
service without recalling to your mind his distinguished services. We v are at this
moment enjoying distinctions which he so largely helped to win, though he is unable to
share in them. Gentlemen, I shall but briefly allude to our labours. They are too new
to be fairly judged perhaps by any one, and certainly we can hardly be impartial
judges of them. The great work by which the Parliament will be known and remem-
bered is now in operation. Its results for good or for evil will affect the country in
every branch of its industry. We spared no labour in its preparation, for never was a
measure more conscientiously and laboriously considered, and Parliament spared no
exertion in maturing its provisions. If it succeeds in changing the face of this great
country no one can deprive us of the glory of passing it into law. If it fails, no one
can charge us with either want of labour or want of patriotism in endeavouring to devise
a measure which commanded such wide-spread confidence and support. Having passed
it, we continue in the same spirit in which this work was undertaken, to make arrange-
ments to carry it into effect. We tried to place its administration in the best and ablest
hands. All the ordinary considerations which so frequently regulate the dispensation of
patronage were disregarded. We had no places for our friends, no rewards for support,
no offices won by political service to give away in connexion with this Act. lam bold
enough to say that no man can put his finger on a single appointment made by us for
the administration of the Act, and truthfully affirm that it was made from any other
motive than a sincere desire to secure the best man for the office. We have dis-
pleased friends, failed perhaps to preserve supporters and to conciliate opponents ;
but we have done what is better for our own fame—we have secured the able and
honest administration of an Act upon which so much of the future national prosperity
depends. I regret that the Minister who bore, and so easily and uncomplain-
ingly bore, the great weight of the labour of passing this measure, and who with
unsparing industry and rare discretion is now r engaged in its administration, is not
present to-night. Never was a great measure carried in spite of overwhelming
difficulties and embarrassments with more firmness, and yet with more inoffensiveness —
with greater information on all its leading provisions and minutest details, and yet with
-ess irritation at continuous and sometimes not inoffensive criticisms. Prepared night and
day on all points for all opponents, with a serenity of temper which many of us envied
and all of us admired, Mr. Parnell for twelve months, by his industry, his courtesy, and
his fulness of information, raised the very character of our Parliament itself. lam not
simply praising a colleague, I am giving expression to the feeling alike of his many
friends and of his few opponents. Gentlemen, 1 shall not presume to trespass upon your
patience by a review of the other labours of the session. They were numerous and
u 16272. ]J


valuable, and would of themselves have justified public confidence in the Parliament
which passed them. lam anxious on this occasion to say a few words to you on other
subjects—not on our own work, but on that of others. You have perhaps heard recently
■ —l think, with astonishment —that we are all supposed to be suddenly inspired with a
great distrust of the Imperial Government, and that we are beginning to engage in
calculations concerning the value of the Imperial connexion. This libel alike upon our
loyalty and our common sense has been pretty freely circulated. It is due to the reputa-
tion of the country that it should be repudiated promptly, energetically, and effectually.
I do not believe that, concerning the matters out of which this imputation has arisen,
there is any strong feeling in this country whatever. I feel perfectly certain that any
man who presumed on a public hustings to assert that any conduct upon the part of the
Imperial Government had ever shaken our allegiance to the Empire would simply be
covered with ridicule. I do not mean to assert that many of us may not be able to
appreciate and regret a certain hesitation and timidity in dealing with colonial questions
which does not augment our personal admiration for individual statesmen of the Mother
Country, but not one of us has any stronger feeling than regret at this want of boldness,
or would favour any stronger measure than a firmly worded remonstrance against it if it
prove to be dangerous to our best interests. We may feel that we have not been treated
with that candour and confidence and consideration which we had a right to expect; but we
know the difficulties as well as the weaknesses of Imperial statesmen, and we should not,
and we will not, be too precipitate in dealing with them in what we conceive to be their
shortcomings. With these preliminary observations I shall say something of the diffi-
culties with which this Government has lately had to deal for a short time. As you are
aware, we have been under a cloud of suspicion as if we were incapable of appreciating
the value of questions of national significance, or were afraid to associate ourselves with
those whose capacity was higher and whose courage more undoubted. For a few weeks,
and until the course of events had fully vindicated our procedure, we were supposed to
be more careful of the ease of the Ministers of England than of the interests of the people
of this Colony. How we could be so suddenly affected with this sacrifice of Colonial to
Imperial interests nobody thought of explaining. It never occurred to any one of our
critics to know why we should prefer the approval of noblemen and gentlemen in England,
whom we had never seen, to the satisfaction of those by whose favour our political
existence was alone continued. I think I shall show you, gentlemen, if it is necessary
to show you, the conduct of the Government of this country in this matter was regulated
by two considerations, both equally important and equally obligatory upon us. One,
what was best to be done in the interests of this' Colony ; and the other, what was due
to the great Empire from which we have sprung. We can discharge no public duty
in this Colony which will be of lasting value to it if in its discharge we weaken the
prestige of that great Empire from which we have derived all that we prize and cherish,
and by which we are protected in the position we occupy before the world. I shall,
with your permission, pass from our domestic to our foreign policy, for, strange to say,
we are now enriched and embarrassed with a great foreign policy. You are aware that
no sooner did we escape from our perils and sufferings in Parliament than we were exposed
to fresh evils of a more serious character. That personification of absolutism in European
statesmanship, the Prince Von Bismarck took upon himself to annex a portion of the island
of New Guinea which no one had ever claimed, which lay outside the British Protectorate
lately established, and which, from the very circumstances that we had abstained from
including it within our limits, he may have imagined we did not intend at any time to
annex. We have no means of knowing whether this was so or not, though we may
indulge in a shrewd suspicion that that distinguished personage did not very much con-
cern or perplex himself with any serious considerations on the subject. Having done this,
and we being in a state of the profoundest ignorance on the whole subject, we were suddenly
appealed to by our neighbours to be up and doing on a grander scale than we had ever
before dreamt of. All at once we were invited to a new display of colonial enterprise,
a new form of audacity—that of unitedly protesting against the action of Germany in
doing that which, so long as she violated no international compact, she had an undoubted
right to do—that is, to occupy for purposes of civilisation an unclaimed and, save in so
far as it was the home of tribes of dangerous savages, an unoccupied territory. We in
these distant Colonies were invited to participate in an act which I cannot regard but as
one concerning which it is difficult to determine whether its imprudence or its absurdity
was the greater. We were to indulge in vague language of protest against the act of a
nation in alliance witii our own Empire; a nation that, on the weightiest grounds of
national policy, it would be a perilous thing for any European Power to provoke ; a nation


of which it is said, without drawing upon its last reserves, it can place in the field at any
time two millions and a half of armed men in the most perfect state of military discipline.
We were invited by participation in this meaningless protest to endanger the relations of
our Imperial Government with this colossal power, which, if it did not regard us with a
mingling of amusement and contempt, would hold the Mother Country responsible for
our silly impudence. Need I say that I felt at once wc could on no grounds whatever
dream of taking part in any such proceeding. Neither our own self-respect, nor our
loyalty to the Empire, nor our conviction of the folly of such a course as that suggested,
would permit us to engage in such a proceeding. If these considerations had failed to
influence us, we should have been saved from humiliating ourselves by our sense of the
ludicrous. Our humour, gentlemen, would have preserved us from provoking the
laughter of Europe. Enthusiastic and profoundly serious men not infrequently blunder
by their failure to see the grotesqueness of their attitude ; and a skilful and successful
diplomacy is sometimes aided by a swift and accurate perception of the ridiculous.
When I thought of this invitation to protest against Germany, the image of that heroic
savage of the coast of New Guinea came before my mind, who, according to a recent
account in the newspapers, intimated his intention to challenge the gallant Commodore’s
establishment of the Protectorate by individually fighting Her Majesty’s ship “ Nelson,’”
or of that humourist—l think it was Thackeray—who, travelling in Scotland, saw at, I
think, Cupar Fife, a little inn called “ The Battle of Waterloo,” the sign of which was a
single kilted Scotchman laying about him with a broad sword. That was the Battle of
Waterloo, gentlemen. Of all Continental nations, I think the last from the people of
which we have anything in these Colonies to fear is the great nation which stands at the
head alike of the culture and the power of Europe—the first Empire of arts and arms of
the world, the Empire of Germany. It is said that Germany is not a colonizing Power,
that she has no great colonial establishments to point to in the sense of the foundation of
exclusively German settlements. This is doubtless true. In no other sense does the
assertion contain a single particle of truth. Through her great cities of Hamburg and
Bremen, she has poured into the United States, during the past half-century, millions of
the most industrious and orderly of her citizens; and, when citizenship had in hours of
trial and danger to be proved by a preparedness to die for the great Republic, these adopted
children of the commonwealth stood the supreine test with a splendid and eternally memo-
rable gallantry. A quarter of a million of them during late years have passed annually
to the United States. Who shall presume to estimate the influence and effect of this
stupendous emigration of a people whose country maintains 21 universities, which give
the finest education to be had in the whole world, not only to their own youth, but to
the natives of other countries of Europe and of America who are sent to Germany for
their education. Gentlemen, there is not one of these Australasian Colonies which is
not under the greatest obligation to the German nation for sending them some of their
most industrious, law-abiding, and patriotic colonists. We have nearly 9,000 of them —
6,248 males and 2,490 females —in this country. They have 8,571 of them in Victoria,
G,891 in Queensland, and more than twice the number in South Australia. We would
welcome tens of thousands of them, and feel grateful to the nation which sent them to us :
and yet we are asked to protest to their Fatherland against the occupation of a portion of a
savage island which we have not touched, which we have abstained from touching, which
we would not and could not occupy if we annexed it, and which we should be unable to
occupy if we did so. We arc asked to protest against the Government of this people
taking a portion of that land. The coming of such a people as this into our neighbour-
hood, engaged, you will remember in a work which our Government would not themselves
undertake, presented to me not only no subject for apprehension, but much to afford
satisfaction and to a great extent to increase our prosperity in these seas. Friends,
co-partners in civilization, and certainly, to take a mere commercial view, customers of
these Australian Colonies, why should we object to them ; how should we be endangered
in these seas by the presence of communities of this great people who are welcomed to
every British Colony of the Empire ; what but benefit could we derive from their neigh-
bourhood ? If we are to have, as we have at present, important French Colonies and
establishments, the protection and support of which require the presence of the armed
vessels and the troops of that nation, in the event of European complications are we
benefited or injured by the presence of the armed force of another great European Power,
which will not, in all probability, be on the same side; but, gentlemen, in taking this
view of the situation are we altering our policy, are we embarrassing the other Colonics,
are we taking a new departure in connexion with this question, we are doing nothing of
the kind. We are acting precisely as we publicly informed the other Colonies before the
H 2


Convention met we intended to act. Our policy is to be found clearly enough indicated
in a letter of Mr. Stuart’s to Mr. Service of date Bth September 1883, which letter was
intended to put with perfect frankness our views. I shall read it to you, in order to show
you that we then contemplated the desirableness and the necessity of England coming to
an arrangement with France and Germany, and that then, as now, we discountenanced
all wild and disloyal talk, insolent pretensions, and all that tended to make a difficult
and delicate question incapable of settlement. The following letter was addressed by
Mr. Stuart to Mr. Service.*
Gentlemen, as you are now aware, that happened which we anticipated. The Imperial
Government has, except in so far as it may have erred in the original limitation of its
Protectorate, not been a party to the German occupation of any portion of New Guinea,
so that had we protested, as we alone could have done, against the conduct of our own
Imperial Government, we should have made ourselves ridiculous, because there was no
foundation whatever for our protest. Gentlemen, I have alluded to those things not
because my colleagues and myself were exposed for weeks to misconception and to
censure on this subject. That is a matter of little concern to you, and I think I may
■ say, without levity, of equal indifference to us ; but I wish to point out to you that while
we have done nothing to injure the interests of this Colony we have taken extreme care
to abstain from doing anything which would embarrass the Imperial Government.
Nothing is easier than to win a cheap popularity by parading a spurious patriotism
which ignores the anxiety and responsibilities of others. I hope we shall never be
tempted to aspire to such a popularity as this, and I trust we shall always have the
patience and endurance to sustain any passing obloquy when we are supported by the
conviction that we are discharging a great public duty. Gentlemen, I thank you on
behalf of the Ministry for this expression of your confidence in our capacity and in our
earnestness, and it gives me personally great pleasure to receive these compliments at
the hands of those who have given to the Legislature an accomplished member, and to
us a colleague for whom we all entertain a feeling of attachment as well as respect. To
him it must be a subject of peculiar satisfaction to be entertained here by you, who gave
him the opportunity of being of service to the public. In Parliament he occupies the
fortunate position of being without a single enemy. I trust for your sake, as for h is,
that his gentleness and his honesty are equally appreciated here.

Power, of any of the islands of the Western Pacific.
Shire of Creswick.
Resolution of Council, January 9, 1885.
That the cordial thanks of this Council be given to the Honourable James Service for
his statesmanlike policy in urging upon the Home Government the absolute necessity of
securing the possession of the entire island of New Guinea, and emphatically protests
against the vacillating policy of Lord Derby as derogatory to the national honour and
prestige of England to allow of a joint occupation with any other Power.
Carried unanimously.
The following Resolutions were duly proposed, seconded, and unanimously carried at a
public meeting of the Citizens of South Melbourne, held, under the presidency of
the Worshipful the Mayor of the City, at the Town Hall, on Tuesday, the 13th day
of January 1885, viz.:—
1. That this meeting views with extreme feelings of regret and alarm the annexation
of a portion of the island of New Guinea by the German Empire, and is of opinion that
this annexation, in direct opposition to the strongly expressed wishes of the Australian
Colonists, is the result of what appears to be the vacillating policy of the English
Government on this important question.
2. That this meeting declares that a strong feeling exists in the community in
reference to the matter of annexation, and is of opinion that the islands of the Pacific
immediately contiguous to Australia should not be occupied by any foreign Power, as
such occupation is fraught with peril to the interests of our country.
3. That this meeting assures the Government of this Colony that it heartily approves
of the action taken by them in protesting against the acquisition of territory by Germany
and France in the Pacific.

Resolution of Council, January 6, 1885.
That this Council views with indignation the action of the British Government in
allowing any portion of New Guinea or any other island adjacent to our coasts to be
annexed by foreign Powers, whereby the peace of this Continent is seriously
endangered, and this Council trusts the Premier of this Colony will not relax in his noble
efforts to prevent such a calamity befalling this our adopted country.

Sir, Creswick, January 10, 1885.
At the meeting of the above branch of the Australian Natives’ Association, held
last evening, a lengthy discussion on the action of the German Government in annexing
portion of the island of New Guinea took place, the members present freely expressing
their opinions on the matter. At the termination of the discussion I was, by resolution,
instructed to convey to you the members’ deep interest in the subject, and their hope
that you will not fail to continue your protests to the Home Government until the just
demands of the Colonists are fully recognised. The members of the branch feel that your
hands cannot be strengthened too much on this subject, so that you can feel assured of
the support and sympathy of your fellow Colonists.

That this Council convey to the Hon. the Premier and the members of the

against the annexation of portion of New Guinea and adjacent islands by Germany, and
that this Council trusts that no steps will fail to be taken by the Cabinet to secure the
undivided control of New Guinea under British law, as its possession by any foreign
Power will always form a source of uneasiness to Australia and a menace against its
security from invasion.

Resolutions of Council, January 5, 1885.
1. That this Council view with sincere regret the attitude assumed by Lord Derby,
Secretary of State for the Colonies, in allowing any foreign Power to have supreme
control over any of the islands adjacent to Australia, and more particularly with regard
to his conduct in not annexing as previously indicated the eastern half of New Guinea.


2. That a copy of the above resolutions be forwarded to the Hon, the Premier, with
an assurance of this Council’s hearty support in the matter, and also an expression of
their appreciation of his persistent and patriotic endeavours to bring about a federation
of the Australian Colonies.

the action taken by Lord Derby in the same matter.

Sir, January 13, 1885.
With feelings of great pleasure I do myself the honour to convey to you the
very cordial thanks of the mayor, councillors, and burgesses of the borough of
Williamstown, for your vigorous and patriotic action relative to the annexation of .New
Guinea, and the prevention of our shores being polluted with French criminals from New
Caledonia.
The widespread indignation at the conduct of those whose mismanagement and want
of foresight have led to the New Guinea fiasco, and the unanimous approval of your
efforts must be sufficient to assure you that any action you may take will be heartily
endorsed and supported by all who have the honour of England and the good of
Australia at heart.
The success of your policy will undoubtedly hasten the federation of the Empire, and
probably will affect to a considerable extent the colonial policy of continental Powers.
It is therefore a matter for congratulation to Victorians, that a Victorian Premier should
have taken the initiative in a movement fraught with such consequences as this must
eventually prove to be.
In the hope that you may speedily be gratified, and Australia benefitted, by a satis-
factory conclusion of the negotiations,
I have, &c.

assurances of devoted loyalty to Your Majesty’s throne and person.
That your petitioners desire humbly and respectfully to express to Your Majesty

of Your Majesty’s subjects to be apprehended from foreign occupation of the unclaimed
portion of the Island of New Guinea or the Islands of the Western Pacific, whether as
penal settlements or otherwise, and of the desirableness of anticipating and preventing
such danger by bringing those islands under British sovereignty, have not received the
regard and consideration due to their importance and urgency from the authorities
administering the Department of the Colonies.
That in the meantime action has to some extent been taken and further action is not

I have the honour, by direction of the Right Worshipful the Mayor, to inform you
that a public meeting, convened at the request of 176 citizens, was held in the Town
Hall on Tuesday evening the 20th instant, when the following resolutions were passed,
copies of which you are requested to be good enough to forward to his Excellency the
Governor (Sir W. C. F. Robinson), for transmission to the Imperial Government.
The resolutions read as follows :
(a.) “ That this meeting declares that the establishment of British authority in New
Guinea and the islands adjacent thereto eastward of the 141° of east longitude isj neces-
sary to the future welfare of Australasia and to the integrity of the Empire, and while
affirming the moral and virtual right of Great Britain to annex that territory, and
regretting the unsatisfactory action of Lord Derby as Secretary of State for the Colonies,
now urges the Imperial Government to utilise the proposed Conference with the German
Government to enforce peaceably, but firmly, British interests and Australian rights.”
{ b .) “ That in the opinion of this meeting any Imperial action or inaction whereby the
islands of the Western Pacific may be lost to the Colonies would not only be at variance
with the frequently expressed wishes of the Australian Colonies, but would also be unjust
to the people of Australasia, and therefore prejudicial to the good feelings which exist
between the Colonies and the Home Government.”
(c.) “ That the Chairman of this meeting be empowered to forward a copy of the
foregoing resolutions to the Hon. John Colton, Chief Secretary of South Australia, for
transmission through his Excellency to the Imperial Government.”

No. 43.
GOVERNOR SOR W. F. D. JERVOIS, G.C.M.G., C.B. (NEW ZEALAND), to the RIGHT
HON. THE EARL OF DERBY, K.G. (Received March 11, 1885.)
My Lord, Christchurch, January 31, 1885.
With reference to my Despatch of the 6th December 1884,* concerning
federation and annexation, in paragraph three of which reference is made to the intention
of my Ministers to propose to Parliament next session to guarantee the cost incident to
the acquisition of the Samoa and Tonga group of islands, it is now desirable that I
should report to your Lordship what has recently taken place as concerns Samoa.
2. It will be recollected that on the same day I forwarded to your Lordship a petition!
signed by King Malietoa, the Vice-King Tupu, and 48 Chiefs and members of
the Government of Samoa, to Her Majesty, praying that Her Government might take
over their country, and either make it a British Colony or permit them to be governed
by New Zealand. At the same time, in accordance with the request of the petitioners,
I telegraphed to your Lordship that I had forwarded their petition.
3. On the 25th of the same month I received a telegramJ from your Lordship,
informing me that the representations which I had forwarded with reference to Samoa
and Tonga would be fully considered, but that foreign interests in those islands presented
difficulties. I duly communicated this telegram to my Ministers.
4. On the 28th December I received a memorandum from the Premier, Mr. Stout,
dated Dunedin, 26th December, informing me that in view of the present state of Samoa
and the reported anxiety of the Chiefs and people to be united to New Zealand, Ministers
deemed it of importance that the Honourable the Colonial Secretary should at once
visit Samoa. They also stated that the visit of the Colonial Secretary would be of
advantage in reference to the establishment of postal services between New Zealand and
the Pacific islands, for which a sura had been voted by the New Zealand Parliament;
and further proposed that the Government steamer “ Hinemoa,” which was due to take
me about that time on a visit to the west coast of this island, should be dispatched on
the mission.
5. The same day that I received this memorandum the Colonial Secretary called on
me here ; and the following day (the 29th) he called on me again in company with the
Premier, On both occasions 1 stated that so far as I was concerned I begged that they
would consider the “ Hinemoa ” entirely at their disposal; but that there appeared to
me to be weighty objections to sending her with a Minister on board to Samoa.
6. Both the Premier and the Colonial Secretary went to Wellington that day.
7. It was not until after they had left that it occurred to me that I had said nothing
to them about the petition which I had forwarded to your Lordship on the 6th December.
As a fact, considering the circumstances under which a somewhat similar petition was
prepared about a year ago, the manner in which the present petition came to me led me
to consider it a document of no great importance. As stated in my Despatch transmitting
it, it was forwarded to me by Messrs. W. McArthur and Company, of Auckland. It
was accompanied by a brief covering letter, the signature to which was illegible. Think-
ing, however, that it might have come from McArthur and Company, I telegraphed to
them to inquire, and received in reply a telegram to the effect that the petition had been
sent to them, but that they had no connexion with the movement. I mention these
facts in order to account for the slightness of the impression which the petition made on
me, which alone was the cause of my not mentioning it to my Ministers.
8. However, when the matter occurred to me, almost immediately after my interview
with the Premier, I informed him by telegram that I had received and forwarded the
petition, and had telegraphed to your Lordship.
9. (I may here mention that if the fact of the petition had any bearing on the question
of the “ Hinemoa ” proceeding to Samoa, it appeared to me to be an argument against
it; for the desire of the Islanders for annexation had already been placed in the hands of
the Imperial Government.)
10. I received in reply a telegram from the Premier, asking me to furnish him by
telegram with a copy of the text of the petition and despatch. I at once did so. At

I 2


the same time I telegraphed to the Premier, asking him whether he wished to cancel the
memorandum of the 26th December, or that I should reply to it. He answered that he
would reply to the question either that evening or l,he following day.
11. It appearing to me that it was more desirable that I should personally consult with
my Ministers on the subject, I went by the steamer which left here that evening, and
arrived at Wellington the following morning.
12. My Ministers urged that the “ Hinemoa,” with the Colonial Secretary on board,
should be despatched forthwith to Samoa. I objected, however, on the grounds
that questions concerning foreign countries do not come under the cognizance of
the Colonial Government; that the presence of a Colonial Government steamer at Samoa,
with a Minster on board, would be likely to lead to complications with any foreign
man-of-war which might be there at the time, and with the Government she represented.
Moreover, the question of the relation of Samoa to Great Britain (whether directly
under the Imperial Government or under the Government of New Zealand) was
already under the consideration of Her Majesty’s Government, who had been informed
of the earnest desire of my Ministers on the subject; and I may add that the presence
of a New Zealand Government steamer in waters subject to the jurisdiction of Her
Majesty’s High Commissioner for the Western Pacific without Imperial authority might
be open to misconstruction.
13. My Ministers, however, maintained that they were within their constitutional rights
in despatching the steamer to Samoa as proposed.
14. It was ultimately agreed that I should immediately telegraph to your Lordship
reiterating the desire my Ministers had already expressed for the annexation of Tonga
and Samoa, and stating that they were prepared next session to propose that New
Zealand should pay the cost; and should the Imperial Government wish it, that they
were ready also to undertake the Government of Fiji; that from information which they
had received from Samoa they believed that the views expressed in the petition were
those genuinely felt by the Samoan people ; and that they proposed, seven days after
the date of my telegram, to despatch the “ Hinemoa ” with a Minister on board to make
inquiries on the subject.
15. I subsequently arranged that in the event of the “Hinemoa” being despatched,
my private secretary, Mr. Pennefather, should also go in her, and directed him to go to
Auckland in order to meet the steamer there.
16. On the sth instant, however, I received a telegram* from your Lordship to the
effect that the Imperial Government regretted that they could not comply with the
desire of my Ministers; that British annexation in Tonga or Samoa was prevented
by existing foreign interests ; and that only recently assurances had been exchanged
with the Imperial German Government for the maintenance of the independence of those
groups of islands. Your Lordship further observed that the despatch of the “ Hinemoa ”
with the Colonial Secretary on board would probably lead to serious complications ; and
expressed a hope that no action might be taken by the Government of this Colony
which would have the effect of preventing the internationalization of the islands.
17. Upon the receipt of this, I requested the Premier to stop the departure of the
“ Hinemoa,” and telegraphed to my private secretary to return from Auckland.
18. The same day I informed your Lordship by telegramf that the “Hinemoa”
would not go to Samoa; adding, at the request of my Ministers, that a day or two
previously they had received information from Samoa to the effect that two German
men-of-war had recently made their appearance there, and that the officers of those
vessels had, immediately on hearing of the despatch of the petition, entered into an
agreement with the King of Samoa which was to last for five years, by which the whole
authority of the Government was handed over to Germany ; but that the King stated
that he had signed the agreement under coercion; none of the Consuls except the
German Consul had been consulted; the Chiefs (who had not been consulted) and
people repudiated the agreement, and the Parliament refused to ratify it. I stated also
that my Ministers once more urged that, inasmuch as several residents in New Zealand
were largely interested in Samoa, if the German annexation in New Guinea was
acquiesced in, it was most desirable that Tonga and Samoa should become part of the
British Empire, and that they trusted that the agreement which had been entered into
between England and France with reference to the New Hebrides would not be in any
way affected.

f No. 114 in [C. —4273] February 1885,


19- The same day I returned to Christchurch ; and soon after my arrival here I
received by telegram from the Premier a full copy of the German-Samoan agreement,
which had been forwarded from Samoa. The Premier added that Ministers thought it
so important and affected them so much that I should telegraph it to the Colonial
Office. I replied by telegram, concurring in the proposal, but pointing out that the
cost of such a message would be about 400 Z., and asking whether they approved of the
expenditure. To this the Premier replied;—
“We think text of treaty should be wired, and perhaps Colonial Office seeing it is of
Imperial importance will refund us cost.”
20. I accordingly forwarded to your Lordship on the Bth instant* the text of the
agreement, adding that I was requested by my Ministers to state that they felt aggrieved
that though the Colonial Office knowing of the petition had telegraphed that the
representations of my Government would be fully considered, yet, nevertheless, assurances
were exchanged between England and Germany that the independence of Samoa would
be respected; and that the proceedings of the German Council were a direct breach of
such assurance.
21. On the 9th instant I received a letter from the King of Samoa (copy enclosed)!
forwarding a copy of a letter from him addressed to Her Majesty, dated the 12th
November, and asking me to telegraph to Her Majesty not to regard the German
treaty, because the Samoans accepted it fearing if they did not Samoa would be
violently taken by Germany, and hoping it would be annulled by annexation to Great
Britain. The King also enclosed a copy of a letterf from him to the Imperial German
Consul, dated 20th November, stating (in reply to a letter from that Consul to the
King) that it was quite true that he and the Samoan Government had asked Her
Majesty to annex Samoa, and that they firmly adhered to that desire.
22. By the same mail I received a letter (copy enclosed) from the Acting British
Consul at Samoa, stating that the feeling throughout the whole of that country in favour
of annexation to Great Britain was genuine and general, and notwithstanding many
attempts to shake their determination, all parties of Samoans were unanimous.
23. These documents appeared to me to be so important, that I telegraphed the
substance of them to your Lordship on the same day.|
24. Meanwhile, constant notices and articles appeared in the newspapers with reference
to the “ movements of the mysterious Hinemoa.” In consequence of these, I telegraphed
to the Premier asking him if necessary to repeat the orders already given, and received
from him an answer to the effect that the vessel was expected back at Wellington in
about ten days.
25. On the 10th instant, I received a telegram from the Premier, stating that Ministers
had wired to the Agent-General asking him to call at the Colonial Office and ascertain
whether your Lordship would allow the New Zealand Government to dispatch a mission
to King Malietoa at Samoa, and perhaps make a similar convention to that made by
Germany, adding “ Hinemoa will await reply.”
26. This course appeared to me to be open to even greater objection than the
original proposal. Your Lordship had given weighty reasons against the Colonial
Government taking action; and the avowed object was now not only to make inquiries
but to enter into an engagement. If any step of the kind were to be taken, obviously it
should be by the Imperial Government. I may add that if the internationalization of
the islands was to be maintained, I felt that it should rather be by the cancelling of
special advantages conceded to Germany or any other Power than by making counter-
agreements.
27. To avoid any chance of misconception of my views on the matter, I telegraphed
to your Lordship on the 10th instant to the effect that the idea of sending the
“ Hinemoa ” to the islands did not meet with my approval, but that I considered that if
any action were to be taken it ought to be by an Imperial officer.
28. Your Lordship informed me in reply, by message received on the 12th instant,
that the Admiralty had already been requested to send a ship to Samoa to enquire into
the state of affairs there; and on the 13th instant I was informed by the Commodore,
in answer to inquiry from me, that the “ Miranda ” had started that morning for
Samoa.

2Q. On my informing my Ministers that your Lordship had taken steps for the
despatch of an Imperial ship to Samoa, the Premier telegraphed back that Ministers
considered that as the petition from King Malietoa asked for annexation to New
Zealand as an alternative, it was their “ duty and right to visit Samoa and ascertain
“ feelings of natives for” themselves ; and they requested me to represent their views to
“ the Colonial Office ” with the object of obtaining your Lordship’s consent to the
despatch of the New Zealand Government steamer.
30. I replied that the matter was one to be dealt with by the Imperial Government,
and not by that of the Colony; moreover, that as an Imperial ship had been despatched
to Samoa to inquire into the state of affairs there, the object desired by the Ministers,
viz,, to ascertain accurately the “ feelings of Samoans,” would be attained ; and that it
appeared, to me that confusion might arise from sending a New Zealand Government
steamer; but that if Ministers still wished me to do so, I would telegraph as they
requested to your Lordship their views respecting the despatch of the “ Hinemoa.”
31. The Premier replied that Ministers thought it better that your Lordship should
know their views. I accordingly telegraphed on the 15th inst.,* submitting the request
of Ministers for your Lordship’s consideration.
32. On the 20th inst.f I received another telegram from your Lordship, to the effect
that Her Majesty’s Government could not approve of the proposed despatch of the New
Zealand Government steamer to Samoa. Your Lordship observed that the question was
not regarded in Europe as one depending on the national feelings of the Samoans, and
that there was no reason for the inquiry which the Government of New Zealand con-
templated making. Your Lordship added that if not prevented by the action of the New
Zealand Government, the Imperial Government ■would, at a conference which was about
to be held, do the best they could for British interests.
33. I accordingly informed the Premier of the substance of this message, and tele-
graphed]; to your Lordship in answer that no step would be taken here.
34. I have thus given your Lordship an account of recent occurrences here with
reference to Samoa. I cannot but feel that the annexation of those islands and of Tonga
in some form or other, would be most desirable in the interests of the Islands themselves,
of this Colony, of the Empire as a whole, and of other powers concerned. There is no
hope that a purely native government will be able to deal with the complicated questions
which must arise from the presence of numbers of Europeans of different nations, and
possibly an influx of Asiatics and Americans. An irregular sort of Government by
foreign Consuls, acting in the name of a native king, is unsatisfactory', tends to complica-
tion and misunderstanding, and at best cannot be permanent. The only means, there-
fore, of avoiding anarchy, is by placing the administration of the public affairs of the
Islands in the hands of one civilised state —in a word, by annexation.
35. The question then arises, which State shall annex ? And whilst observing that
the natives themselves express a decided opinion in favour of the United Kingdom, I
submit that the interests of all nations would be best served by Samoa becoming a British
Possession under such guarantees as would be satisfactory to other Powers.
36. The inhabitants of Samoa, whether native or foreign, would be thus under the Govern-
ment which possesses the greatest facilities for the promotion of trade, and one which has
always shown itself anxious to grant equal rights to foreigners and native-born subjects,
I may mention that in this Colony' (as was recently pointed out by the Premier in an
able speech, of which I enclose an extract,) there are settlements of Germans, Danes, and
Norwegians, to whom every facility is offered for the acquisition of land, and who are in
every respect regarded as British subjects; and in South Australia, where I last had the
honour of being Her Majesty’s representative, not only were there thriving German
settlements from which the Colony derived much benefit, but Germans became members
of Parliament, and a German gentleman was for some time during my Government
the Minister of Education.
3?■ Whether Samoa and Tonga should become small Colonies mutually independent;
whether they should become dependencies of New Zealand ; whether they should form
part of a large island Colony with Fiji for its head; or whether the whole group thus
formed should be placed under New Zealand, is a question which, looking to the
future, I venture to submit as one deserving the most , serious consideration of Her
Majesty’s Government.

Youn Excellency, Mulinuu, Samoa, November 25, 1884.
I write to inform your Excellency that it has been made known to me that the
German man-of-war has secretly gone to New Zealand to send a telegram to Germany
about the agreement which they made by force with our Government, and also to place
obstacles with regard to our petition to Her Majesty the Queen of Great Britain.
I, therefore, explain to your Excellency that what caused me to consent to this
agreement was our fear that if I did not consent to it the German Government would
quickly take our country by force. I have written a letter to the Queen of Great
Britain explaining the reason why we made this agreement, and my letter will arrive in
England about the 15th of December.
For this reason I beg your Excellency will inform the Queen of Great Britain by
telegram of that letter, and also beg Her Majesty will take no notice of that agreement,
because we consented to it through fear, and that our belief is that if the British
Government is established in our country then that agreement will come to an end.
I trust that your Excellency will grant my entreaty.
May your Excellency receive blessings.
I am, &c.

Sir, Mulinuu, November 12, 1884.
I write to inform your Excellency that I have written to Her Majesty the Queen
of Great Britain and made known to Her Majesty our petition, which has been com-
municated to the Governor of New Zealand, it is mentioned also in this letter. I have
begged your Excellency that you would explain to Her Majesty everything that gave
rise to my receiving the agreement which was made last night with Germany, I and my
Government having been much distressed lest our group of islands should be taken by
Germany.
I wrote yesterday to the German Consul and begged him to give me a copy of the
agreement with me and my Government, which we were required to sign, but the
German Consul replied that he refused to give me and my Government a copy ; then
the whole Government met together and deliberated what was right to do, and it ended
in our rejecting the agreement, and it was not received, notwithstanding that our distress
still continued. It was getting near the hour of night which was fixed to hold the
meeting at the German Consulate, and I walked in the road when Tupua Tamasese
came down.
He spoke to me with distress, and told me that same bad story. I and Tamasese
bearing in mind the agreement, we were very anxious, and I said, “ Let us both go down
“ and receive the agreement in order that we may be at peace to-day, and let us wait for
“ the decision of Great Britain.” I beg your Excellency to make known to Her
Majesty the great love of me and my Government for Great Britain, and also our strong
desire to give up our group of islands to the Government of Great Britain.
I hope Her Majesty will take no notice of this agreement with Germany. lam deter-
mined when the Government of Her Majesty is in these islands then that agreement
shall end.

Will your Excellency be pleased to make these things clear to Her Majesty the
Queen of Great Britain and do you send this letter by the steamer at Tutuila.

Your Majesty,
This is to make known to Your Majesty that we, the King of Samoa and Chiefs of
these islands, have sent a petition to Your Majesty praying that you would set up 3’our
Government in Samoa. We have sent that petition to the Governor of New Zealand,
and have besought him to send a telegram to Your Majesty that he has received our
petition. We have informed Your Majesty that painful anxiety has taken possession of
our minds because we are much afraid of Germany lest she should take our islands
against our wills. Your Majesty, we are in distress on account of the Government of
Germany lest they should take our islands, therefore we have accepted another agree-
ment with Germany. I wish to make clear to Yonr Majesty that for that reason I have
accepted the agreement against my own will and likewise against the will of my
Government, but I have accepted it on account of my fear; and I thought that, should
your Government be set up in these islands that agreement would have no effect. I
have entreated the British Consul here to make clear to Your Majesty all the reasons of
our fears, which have led us to accept this agreement, and to make clear to Your Majesty
the meaning of that agreement,’ and to inform Your Majesty of the great regard of myself
and Government for Your Majesty and the Government of Great Britain, and our great
desire to give our islands to the Government of Your Majesty. I respect extremely
the Government of Your Majesty, and trust that speedily you will receive favourably
our petition.
I am, &c.

Sir, Mulinuu, November 20, 1884.
I have received your letter respecting tiie report which your Excellency has heard
that I and the Government of Samoa have written to Her Majesty the Queen of Great
Britain in order that Samoa may be joined to Her Government.
To this I reply to your Excellency that it is very true that we have thus written and
also that we will hold firmly to that desire. And I also inform your Excellency that
the report that Germany was about to seize our country was widely spread (general).
And another matter I complain to your Excellency that it was very wrong of Mr.
Weber to threaten some of the Chiefs of the Government in order that our petition to
the Queen should be withdrawn, —Morris also came, —and that if a letter was not sent
(to that effect) then would come great trouble to our Government.
I beg your Excellency to forbid Mr. Weber, so that he shall desist from again doing
anything of the kind.
May you live.
I am, &c.

The Acting British Consul at Samoa, to Sir Wm. Jervols.
British Consulate, Samoa,
Your Excellency, December 2, 1884.
The Samoan Government have furnished me with a copy of a second letter that
they have forwarded to you, also a copy of a letter they sent to the German Consul in


answer to an inquiry from him as to whether they had solicited annexation to Great
Britain or not. This also they informed me had been sent to your Excellency to show
that their determination was still the same.
Their idea is that when you hear of the agreement with Germany, that it will be
imagined that they have changed their minds, and you will, in consequence, not feel
disposed to forward their wishes.
In case the Samoans should not have sent translations I have the honour to enclose
such.
The feeling throughout the whole country is genuine and general, and in spite of all
sorts of attempts to shake the Government determination they remain firm and decided
to await the decision of Great Britain. Never before in the memory of the oldest
sojourner here, have the Samoans been in such unanimity, all parties being united for the
same object.
Your Excellency may be surprised at their not having sent their application through
me, but in reality they were acting in strict accordance with my advice, very frequently
sought for, viz., that if they wished Great Britain to take favourable notice of their
wishes in such an important matter as that of cession, it must not be the result of
official influence, but must be an unconditional act, of and from themselves, as a nation;
also that it must be the desire of a decided majority.
Sincerely hoping that your Excellency will be disposed to help these people in their
honest and unanimous desire, the non-acceptance of whicli they, with reason, look upon
with great dread,
I have, &c.

Enclosure 3 in No. 43.
“The Otago Daily Times,” Thursday, January 22, 1885.
Extract from a Speech of the Hon. R. Stout, Premier of New Zealand, at Dunedin,
January 21, 1885.
Federation and Local Government.
I am exceedingly sorry that with the time at my command it will be simply impossible
to give you more than what may be termed a very brief sketch of my views on these
questions. So far as federation is concerned, lat once admit to you that my views have
been considerably modified since I last appeared on this platform. I told you then that
I looked forward to New Zealand having a federation of the Pacific for herself: though T
looked forward also to that wider federation of English-speaking nations —a federation of
England, Australasia, and even of the United States ; so that we might hasten in some
respects that time which I hope yet to see coming near, when there shall be no more war
in the world; but that I thought the Australian federation was premature, and I was,
as you are aware, rather opposed to the Federal Council Bill. After further carefully
considering the question and reading all I could on the subject, and also considering the
position in which we were placed in the Pacific, I found it was absolutely necessary that
something should be done to unite all the Australian Colonies, and I thought it my duty
at the time not to raise anything against Major Atkinson and Sir F. Whitaker’s proposals.
They having been to Australia, and having done so much in the way of federation, it
appeared to me that perhaps it would be the best idea to carry out, in a modified way,
federation if I believed it would benefit the Colony. Ido not believe in any politician
opposing proposals because they do not happen to come from himself or his party, for it
is his duty as a true colonist to do what he can to support anything that can benefit the
Colony, from whatever source the idea may have emanated. It appeared to me that it
was absolutely necessary that there should be federation —that is, a union—between the
Australasian Colonies. I thought it was necessary if we were to have any command of
the Pacific. What, then, was to be done ? The Federal Council Bill, as you are aware,
provided that there should be a Federal Council established for Australasia, and that this
Federal Council should be one chamber (that is an advance), and should deal with the
following subjects :—The first is: The relations of Australia with the islands of the
Pacific. Second: Prevention of influx of criminals. Third : Fisheries in Australasian
waters. Next: The improvement of judgments. Next: The enforcement of criminal
u 16272. K


processes. The next: The custody of offenders on board of ships belonging to Her
Majesty’s Colonial Governments beyond territorial limits. The Council was also to deal
with other questions if referred to it by any two Colonies. But these laws were only to
be enforced in the Colonies that referred the questions to the Federal Council —the law,
though passed by the Federal Council, should not be enforced in the Colonies unless
passed again by the Legislatures of the Colonies. I believe a Federal Council in that
form would be of enormous benefit in the Pacific. What is our position here ? For many
years we have been urging that the English rule should be extended over the Pacific. In
1878 I brought that question prominently before the Governor by a memorandum which
appeared in the Blue Books in reference to the New Hebrides. Those islands, you know,
have been the seat of the Presbyterian Missions of Scotland, Canada, New Zealand, and
Australia, and I thought they, at all events, should not become French territory, but
British. Unfortunately, the British Government have done nothing to bring that about,
but, on the contrary, have practically allowed the French to get enormous power over
those islands. Then, in reference to Samoa and Tonga, we—l mean the people of New
Zealand—felt that at the time Fiji was annexed those islands should also have been
brought under the British rule. New Guinea was of little interest to us in New Zealand,
but we also desired to see it under British rule. Now it may be asked, What objection
can you have to the Germans or the French having colonies in the Pacific ? I say we
have no objection to German colonisation, no objection to French colonisation, as if the
German colonies and the French colonies were placed in this position —namely, that the
French and German colonies were allowed to federate wuth us, —then I think we should
rather, if anything, like them to come. But I want to know what is the meaning of
French and German colonisation in the Pacific. It simply means this, That in the event
of a European war the site of the war will be changed from Europe to the Pacific. We
know very well that when there was danger of a war with Russia there were Russian
men-of-war in Siberian and Japanese ports ready to attack the Australian Colonies.
That is well known at home and well known to many Fere; and the result of this colonisa-
tion will be this, that if you allow these various nationalities to spring up in the Pacific
you will simply destroy all chance of having what we all hope to see, that is, these new
colonies saved from the ruinous wars that have been devastating older lands, European
lands, and instead of having peace reign here, we shall have all the horrors of war, and
all the injuries of war, inflicted on us. I therefore say there is no question of loss of
territory. There is no desire to exclude the Germans or French from having
colonies. Why, New Zealand has invited Germans here, it has paid their passages,
and founded settlements for both Scandinavians and Germans in the North Island;
and so far as this Colony is concerned I am glad to say we have never raised
the question of nationality against any who have come to us. We have, I say,
no objection to German and no objection to French colonisation, but if we are to
allow the Pacific to be divided among the European nations without at all con-
sulting the inhabitants of these islands, and to be divided not really for the purposes of
colonisation at all, but for the purposes of providing coaling ports and naval stations,
then in case of war we are, I say, inviting something against ourselves, and the result
will be that we shall have to keep a large fleet in the Pacific, to go to a large expense
defending our ports. We have already gone to considerable expense ; in. Australia the
expenditure for defence has been greater, and we must go to further expense, and all this
will be brought about not from any danger of any dispute between New Zealand and
any other Colonies that may be in the Pacific, but because of European disputes. We
say, if we could have done anything to prevent that, it was our duty to prevent it. Now I
come to what a great deal has been written about, the “ Hinemoa ” and ■Samoa. What was
the position of affairs with regard to Samoa ? We had private letters from Samoa stating
that there was a petition being prepared for presentation to the Queen, and that there
was considerable agitation going on as to whether it ought not to be annexed to Britain.
Samoa has a king, a vice-king, and two Houses of Parliament, and it is in what we may
term a semi-civilised state; and it has been recognised by Germany, England, and
America as an independent State, for all these nations have made treaties with it. We
find, then, Samoa anxious to join New Zealand—anxious to become part of New Zealand,
or part of the British Empire; and what we asked to do was this, to send down a steamer
and ascertain the feeling, because we heard there had been a treaty made between
Germany and the King of Samoa; not a treaty made voluntarily on the part of the King
of Samoa, because he wrote to say that he was forced to make it by the officers of the
German man-of-war; that as soon as the German officers knew that he had petitioned the
Queen for annexation they came down and demanded that he should make a treaty, and
forced him to do so. A fortnight after he made the treaty he wrote to the officers telling


them that notwithstanding he had made the treaty he was still desirous of annexation
with Britain, and that the treaty had been made through force or duress. Then what we
did was this : we were prepared to send a steamer down to ascertain the feeling of Samoa
as to annexation, and we considered it our duty, so as not to cause any complications
between the Home and the German Governments, to wire to Earl Derby telling him our
intentions, and that the steamer would leave in 10 days, and, of course, he was to under-
stand .that if he did not stop the steamer it would go. I know the press have asked,
Why do you not tell us all that you are going to do ?• But surely there would be no
such thing as proper government carried on if we had to go and “ blab ” at each street
corner of all that we were going to do. One would imagine from what some of the
papers said that whenever a Cabinet Council was held the members should be surrounded
by special correspondents and editors. We did not disclose to the newspapers or anyone
(for the secret was well kept) what we were going to do with the steamer till the answer
came from Lord Derby, because we did not wish anyone to know it. Well, Lord Derby
said that considering Samoa was an independent State he could not allow us to send a
steamer, but he has, and the papers can get this, though I should not tell them now, only
the steamer will be there, sent the “ Miranda ” war vessel from Sydney, and she will be
there now, I expect, two or three days. That is all in reference to Samoa, and I think
looking at these islands, seeing that they are practically the centre of the Pacific, and con-
tain one of the finest harbours in the whole of the Pacific, the English ought to have
annexed Samoa and Tonga when they annexed Fiji. I think, however, it is very unfair,
as has been done in England, to blame Lord Derby, as if he were alone to blame. If you
read the history of the Pacific question you will find that the present Gladstone Govern-
ment is not more to blame than the previous Tory Government, but that all English
Governments, perhaps through not thinking sufficiently what the Pacific means and what
it will be, have been supine in dealing with the question of annexation. No one can say
that if they had chosen to annex the whole of New Guinea anyone would have objected,
or that any injury would have; been done. I say it is exceedingly to be regretted that
English statesmen have not looked ahead in this respect. In fact, it proves the remark
made by Sala in his book, “ The Expansion of England,” that almost all the territory
Britain has acquired has been forced upon her, not by her statesmen, but by those prac-
tically acting against her statesmen for the time being. I say it would be to our advantage,
and to the advantage of Britain, if these islands become British possessions ; and if we
could have a federation, perhaps including America and England, we should save the
expense of defensive works and of a fleet, and also save ourselves from the horrors of war
in the future. I say, further, that though the New Zealand Parliament does seem to
be against federation at present, it is for the interest of New Zealand that it should not
stand aloof from the rest of the Colonies. No doubt a grander and better thing for New
Zealand to have carried was the motion of Sir George Grey some } r ears ago, that she
herself should be the centre of the Pacific, with steamers canying her produce and her
educating men to the Pacific islands, as various of her educational grants provide, and
that she practically should have control of the Pacific. I say her day is past in that
respect, and I much regret it; and I blame the past Administration for not seeing that it
was enormously to our advantage that we should have the Hgh Commissioner of the
Pacific remain our Governor, as that linked us to the Pacific in a way which we now lose.
Seeing we cannot succeed in that, it is our duty now not to stand aloof, but unite with
the Australian Colonies, and do what we can to bring them together. Of course Ido
not wish to see Australia interfere in the slightest degree with our legislation or in any
local laws, or to see a dominion formed such as some of the Australian statesmen have
pictured. I desire to see a kind of legalised convention that will enable our various
Australasian Colonies to unite on things of common interest, and to act as one in all
matters dealing with the Pacific, and with the various matters to which I have referred.

ADMIRALTY to COLONIAL OFFICE.
Sir, Admiralty, March 12, 1885.
I am commanded by my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to transmit, for
the information of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, copy of the Report by Captain
Cyprian Bridge, of H.M.S. “ Espicglc,” on Samoa.
Similar letter sent to the Foreign Office.
I am, &c.
The Under Secretary of State, (Signed) EVAN MACGREGOR.
Colonial Office.
Enclosure in No. 49.
Report by Captain Cyprian A. G. Bridge, H.M.S. “ on Samoa.
The Samoan or Navigators Islands are divided into two groups, one composed of
Sawaii, Upolu, and Tutuila; and the other, the Manu’a group, of Ofoo, Olosenga, and
Tau. The former is the larger and more populous, and is, practically, the only part of
Samoa in which foreigners have any considerable business or planting interests. The
principal islands have often been described. In them all the usual products of tropical
islands can be obtained with facility. The climate is said to be healthy, and, considering
the latitude of the group, unusually favourable to white men. It is asserted that in
Samoa they live to an advanced age; and they certainly appear to be less enervated
than do the white residents of most tropical countries. Hurricanes occur in the recog-
nised hurricane season; but they are probably rare, as that which caused so much
damage at Apia in March, 1883, is declared to have been the first for 16 years. Owing
to the want of perfectly secure harbours, Pango Pango, in Tutuila, being the only one
deserving that description, when they do come, vessels can scarcely hope to escape their
fury.
The native population is estimated at 34,000, of whom the greater part lives on Upolu.
All are nominally Christians, 27,000 being claimed by the Congregationalists of the
London Missionary Society, 5,000 by the Roman Catholics, and the remainder by the
Wesleyans. It is stated that, whilst those belonging to the last-named body show a
tendency to increase, the Congregationalists are diminishing. It is probable that this
diminution, if real, may be, attributed to a more accurate enumeration of bond fide
adherents of the Congregational Church. It is the practice of missionary societies in the
Western Pacific to claim the complete conversion of the inhabitants of islands, and some-
times of whole groups, over whom the white missionaries can exercise only an altogether
imperfect supervision, and who are frequently left, for all but a few days in each year, to
the sole guidance of Polynesian teachers. Judging from the demeanour and customs of
the people of districts which are but seldom visited by a white pastor, to take the number
of real Christians as being the same as that of the total population would be a mistake.
The London Missionary Society began a mission in Samoa 54 years ago, in 1830. Civil
wars are still common, and villages not more than a mile apart attack each other, cut
down fruit trees, and shoot the owners.
In November, 1883, the white, coloured, and half-caste population within the Munich
pality of Apia was :


The total whites were 165; others, 218; grand total, 383. The non-Samoan popula-
tion outside the municipality is, approximately, 200, amongst whom there are about 75
whites (56 men, 7 women, and 12 children); the rest are half-castes and coloured.
Amongst the 7 5 whites there are 29 Germans, 39 English, 4 Americans, 4 Scandinavians,
and 5 French, The Germans are managers and overseers of German plantations, and
traders. Amongst the English are 13 missionaries and their families. The five French
are missionaries. The English, American, and Scandinavian traders are, with a few

Apparently the greater part of the productive land in Samoa is claimed by foreigners
as having been purchased by them from the natives. The extent of the foreigners’
claims was estimated in 1884 at —.

Other British claims - - - - 5,000 „
German - • • - - - - 202,000 „
American ------ 30,000 „
A map of Upolu, on which the extent of land owned, or at least claimed, by Germans
was marked in red, showed that the greater part of the island was considered their
property. Less than half was left for the 20,000 natives who inhabit Upolu and for the
British and American claims besides. The British claims, it will have been seen, are
very much larger than the German. Much of the land owned by Germans has been
laid out and planted with cocoa-nut trees, cotton plants, and coffee plants. Good
wooden houses for the accommodation of European overseers and of the labourers from
Melanesian and Micronesian islands have been erected at several points. Some dozens
of miles of very fair roads, on which wheeled carriages can be driven, have been formed.
In 1883 the acreage of German plantations was—

Since November, 1883, about 300 acres of new land have been cleared and planted.
The culture of tobacco has been introduced experimentally on a large scale on nearly
all the plantations. An attempt to introduce cocoa has also been made. The cocoa-nut
plantations are used as pasture as soon as the palms have grown up out of reach of the
cattle, of which there are now about 1,000 head on the various properties.
The cotton grown is “ Sea Island,” of superior quality. Up to the present copra
alone has been produced from the cocoa palms. Machinery for working up the fibre of
the nut into an article of trade has arrived in Samoa. The coffee has been planted from
one to two years. The present annual produce of the plantations is about 300 tons of
copra and 1,600 bales of cotton, at about 260 lbs. to the bale. The native production
of Samoa may be estimated at between 2,000 and 3,000 tons of copra. Latterly,
nearly the whole has been exported by the two German firms, —the Sud-See Handels
und Piantagens Gesellschaft and Messrs. Rug 6 & Co.
The labourers on the plantations are brought from the Line Islands, Solomon Islands,
New Britain, New Ireland, and New Hebrides. It is asserted that great improvement
has quite recently been made in their treatment. The Sud-See firm, which owns all the
large plantations, employs an English medical man, who, amongst his other duties, super-
vises the labourers. They receive as food yams, taro, bread-fruit, salt salmon, salt beef,
fresh beef, rice, Indian corn, &c. The death-rate amongst them in 1882 was 5 per cent.;
this rose in 1883 to 8 per cent. The increase was accounted for by the introduction of
natives of New Ireland, whose further immigration the doctor has recommended should
be discontinued. It is looked upon as certain that the supply of labour from other
Pacific islands will fail altogether in a few years’ time, and the possibility of employing
Chinese has already been discussed.
The foreign trade of Samoa is chiefly in German hands. The Sud-See Company and
Messrs. Rug 6 & Co. are the largest firms in Apia. The shipping and trade returns for

account.
Of the German imports, 8,800/. worth was cash; of this, 8,600/. cash, and goods
valued at 35,811/., were re-exported. Of the American imports 1,000/. worth was cash,
and there was a considerable re-export. The value of the cotton exported in 1883 was
70,249 dollars, say 14,000/. Of the goods imported the greater proportion is of British
origin.
Accounts are usually kept in dollars and cents. The use of debased Bolivian dollars
is common. English sovereigns, however, are readily taken. From the Sydney Mint
assay of 60 half-dollars, the average weight was found to be and the average fineness
6,684, in 1,000. Several descriptions of South American coins are in circulation.
Three islands of Savaii, Upolu, and Tutuila, with the adjacent islets, are supposed
to comprise the kingdom of Samoa, which is under a native Chief Malie-toa, acknow-
ledged as king by Great Britain, Germany, and the United States, and a Government or
Malo. The latter is maintained in conjunction with the frame of the King in treaties
and conventions with civilised states, and in addresses and other ceremonial utterances.
The King is a leading Chief who has been acknowledged as sovereign by the treaty
powers—Great Britain, Germany, and the United States of America. The regal dignity
is therefore of recent origin and, practically, a foreign importation. The designation
Malie-toa is said to be a Tongan phrase, meaning literally “ good (fighting) cock,” and
so “ great warrior.” It is believed to have been conferred on an ancestor of the present
holder by a retreating force of Tongan invaders whom he had been instrumental in
expelling from Samoa. There is a rival family, that of the Tupua. of equally, or even
more, illustrious descent, the members of which feel aggrieved at the kingly position
accorded to Malie-toa. One of the Tupua house has received the title of Vice-King.
Foreigners in general agree that the adherents of Malie-toa are in a majority, perhaps
include three-fourths of the natives. The Tupua are poorer than even Malie-toa. The
latter is a Protestant Christian, and was educated by the English Missionaries. The
heir of the house of Tupua is a Roman Catholic, and (1884) is under the instruction of
the French priests at the seminary above Apia. The priests regard him as “ the son of
the real Kingit may be interesting hereafter to remember that the young man has
been regarded as having that position. The state of things in Samoa is only temporary,
and the existing form of government may, in accordance with treaties, be submitted to
revision at a future date.
Thefcllowing account of Samoan political institutions has been supplied by Dr. Stuebel,
Imperial German Consulate, Apia:—“Political rights in Samoa are solely vested in
heads of families. These are either chiefs, alii, or commoners, tula-fale. Of a great
many chiefs and tula-fale a few are more powerful than the rest. They are called high
chiefs and high tula-fale. It is they who own or owned most of the land. Political
rights are exercised in the assembly of the chiefs and tula-fale of the village in matters
concerning the village, and in the assembly of the district in matters concerning the
district. These assemblies legislate and sit as courts of justice as well. Within the
village and the district they form an acknowledged authority. The assembly of the
chiefs and tula-fale at Mulinuu, the seat of the so-called Government, is nothing but a
place for making speeches. The ‘ King ’ is king only by the recognition accorded
him by the treaty powers,”
Malie-toa himself is without any power, and is, apparently, not endowed with the
strength of character that would enable him to acquire it. In his speeches and replies to
foreign naval officers he speaks of himself “ and the Government.” He has no revenue
from his subjects, a word, which if they understood it, many of them would most likely
object to; and, having parted with most of his land to foreigners, and finding pretended
sales of that belongingto other people no longer possible,-is without any regular income,
except an allowance of twenty dollars a month recently made to him by the municipality
ol Apia. The central authority in Samoa is composed of the king, the Tamoa or
“ House of Lords,” and the Fai-pnle or “ House of Representatives.” There is really


only a single assembly, and both Tamoa and Fai-pule appear to be elective; greater
dignity is supposed to be somehow or other attached to the former. Foreign recognition
and constitutional forms notwithstanding, there does not appear to be any effective
general government in Samoa.
In 1879, by a convention signed by representatives of Great Britain, Germany, and
the United States of America, and the King, the town and district of Apia, the limits
of the latter being defined in a separate clause, were constituted a sort of neutral territory
to be governed as a municipality by the Consuls of the treat)' powers. This has now a
regular government, with a magistrate, police, health officer, pilot, &c. The municipality,
from rates, licences, fines, tolls, &c., raises an annual revenue of about 5,000 dollars.
Judging from the financial statement, the pilotage fees and salary of pilot (1,800 dollars)
are accounted for in other documents. In 1880 the assessment returns of Apia showed
that the property liable to municipal rates was valued at 231,120 dollars, or about
46,000 J. There are several hotels, many stores, some large places of business, two or
three good landing places, and the conveniences generally found in a prosperous European
settlement. The means for maintaining good order seem to be quite efficient.

My Lord, Sydney, January 25, 1885.
I have the honour of enclosing for your Lordship’s information the following
extracts from a Sydney newspaper containing the principal reasons why I have sent a
cablegram to Prince Bismarck. The subject of the extract may also remind your Lord-
ship that until now I have not had a direct definitive answer to ray cablegram of
October 27th, 1883,* nor to my two letters to your Lordship of the 28th October 1883,f

To the Eight Hon. the Earl of Derby,
Secretary of State for the Colonies,
&c., &c., &c.,
Enclosure in No. 50.
The principal reasons why I decided to send the cable § are:—•
I. Having given more than once the promise to the natives of the Maclay-Coast to
prevent, as much as it would be in my power, the evils connected with the invasion of
the whites, and believing that at present such a danger is close at hand, I found that it
is my duty (as trusted spokesman of ihe natives of that part of New Guinea) not to
be too late to prevent the above-mentioned danger as much as, possible.
11. Having seen during my travels in the Pacific many examples of the most shameless
cheating of natives and spoliation by German traders, which proceedings until now have
never been checked by the German Government by any law or regulation (as regards
kidnapping, selling fire-arms, spirits, &c) ; but quite the contrary, the German Govern-
ment has, more than once, appointed these traders, or men interested in the trade of the
Pacific, as German Consuls, whose information about the natives has often induced the
commanders of German war vessels, misled by the official position of their informers, to
do great wrongs to the natives.
111. Not being sure that such a policy in the islands annexed by Germany will be
abolished, and a more just and humane treatment of South Sea natives introduced, I

u 16272. L


decided to request that the Maclay-Coast should be placed under international protection ,
requesting the Powers (England, Russia, Germany, France) to recognise at the same
time the autonomy or self-government of the Maclay-Coast. This international protec-
tion based on an international agreement (to which the Powers interested in the Pacific
may have to come) to respect the rights of the natives of the Pacific, and to help them
to rise to a higher standard of civilisation, would mean the respect of the following
principles in dealing with the natives of the islands :
1. Most strict respect of all the rights of the “natives as men,” as members of
“ human kind.”
2. Prevention of kidnapping and slavery.
3. Equal facilities for missionaries (as educators of the native races) of all nations and
denominations.
4. Identical treatment for all traders of all nations without “distinction”
IV. The request for autonomy of the Maclay-Coast was made by me to the British
Government (as a Power greatly interested in the future of New Guinea) as far back as
October 27, 1883, and repeated in my letter to Lord Derby of the 10th November of last
year, which 1 forwarded at the same time with a letter to the Minister for the Foreign
Affairs of Russia, containing a similar request.
Y. My last, and I think a still stronger reason, for asking for the recognition of the
autonomy of a native government (most decidedly under international control) is the
belief that the time has come, or is very near, that the natives of different parts of the
world (I mean the dark races) will be treated by civilised Powers with the recognition of
their full right to enjoy the benefits of international law, and not as wild animals which
have to be tamed into slavery or exterminated as dangerous animals.
Should the natives of the Maclay-Coast have the means (other than myself, as their
spokesman) to claim their right, I should be glad not to trouble myself in sending cable-
grams and writing letters, but keep to my special scientific work. In the present state
of affairs, however, it is my duty to remember my promise given to people who have
trusted me.
I may add, that having sent a cablegram to Berlin, the same morning I wrote a pressing
letter to His Majesty the Emperor of Russia, repeating the request to recognise the
autonomy of the Maclay-Coast.
To prevent misunderstandings, I shall not neglect to forward also a letter to Prince
Bismarck explaining my cablegram, which of course had to be short, and could be
misunderstood.
I am confident that in my action and actions, by-and-by, I shall have the sympathy
of all just and far-seeing men who object to the spreading of confusion, kidnapping, and
slavery, and wish to see the establishment of security, order, and peace amongst the
natives of the islands of the Pacific.
No. 51.
GOVERNOR THE RIGHT HON. LORD AUGUSTUS LOFTUS, G.C.B., to the RIGHT
HON. THE EARL OF DERBY, K.G. (Received March 16, 1885.)
My Lord, Sydney, January 31, 1885.
I have the honour to inform your Lordship that Major-General Scratchley, R.E.,
Her Majesty’s Special Commissioner for New Guinea arrived here on the 21st instant.
2. I have already informed your Lordship that my Government, as well as the other
Australian Governments, has been much disconcerted by learning from General
Scratchley’s instructions that it was clearly understood by the Imperial Government that
the Protectorate was not to be a source of expense to Great Britain. This Government
entirely dissents from this view, and lias telegraphed to Sir Saul Samuel instructing him
to point out emphatically to the Imperial Government that no such understanding was
agreed upon at the Convention, and that the Colonies were only pledged to a specific
sum, and that this pledge was, only given on the understanding that the Imperial
Government was to co-operate with the Colonies in the establishment and maintenance of
the Protectorate.
3. Surprise is also expressed that an Imperial Officer of General Scratchley’s rank,
appointed to be Special Commissioner, should have arrived here without any provision
being made for his conveyance to his seat of Government, for it was naturally supposed
that Her Majesty’s Government could never have intended that Her Majesty’s Special


Commissioner should arrive in New Guinea in a chartered sailing vessel manned by
blacks, with a view to establish Imperial jurisdiction.
4. In the embarrassment in which General Scratchley is placed, this Government has very
generously offered him the use of the “ Wolverene,” with her present crew of 37 officers
and men, free of all expense for six months. General Scratchley has accepted the offer,
seeing no other means of reaching New Guinea. This will enable him to visit the new
possessions placed under his authority, to commence some sort of establishment at Port
Moresby, such as customs, police, &c., and to gain a full knowledge of the exigencies
required, and possibly some idea of the means for providing for them.
5. I have the honour to enclose to your Lordship copy of a Minute by Mr. Dailey on
the New Guinea annexation, which he has requested may be communicated to your
Lordship, as also copy of a telegram referring to it which he addressed to the Agent-
General.
6. In Mr. Dailey’s Minute it is stated, that as the Government of this country is
sincerely anxious to obviate, as far as possible, any difficulties which may arise in giving
immediate effect to the course which the Imperial Government has taken, this Govern-
ment has intimated to General Scratchley that they are prepared to pay whenever called
upon the proportion of the 15,000/. provided for the year ending in June 1885, and
that it is also prepared to make provision for the proportionate increase of the contri-
bution should a similar course be taken by the other Australian Colonies. This
increased contribution will be also dependent upon a provision being made by the
Imperial Government to take its fair share of the necessary expenditure.
7. There has evidently been a misapprehension on the part of the Imperial Govern-
ment in regard to their participation in the expenses of the Protectorate. This Colony,
and, I believe, all the Australian Colonies, are prepared to act liberally in this matter,
but I feel confident that if Her Majesty’s Government should decline to pay any
contribution towards the general expenses of the Protectorate, and the establishment of
an Imperial officer for exercising Imperial authority, no increase of contribution will be
granted to the present sum, nor do 1 think that its continuance can be relied on. Under
such circumstances it will not be possible to retain a Special Commissioner in New
Guinea. With no constituted authority in New Guinea and its dependencies (notwith-
standing the promises of protection made by Commodore Erskine on proclaiming the
Protectorate), that country will inevitably become the prey of filibusters and specu-
lators, which may give rise to much disaster and bloodshed.
8. As the High Commissioner will now be relieved of a great portion of his duties by
the annexation in the Western Pacific by Germany, and as at the present moment since
the departure of Sir William Des Yoeux, there is no Acting High Commissioner, I
presume that the duties of the High Commissioner will virtually cease and be placed in
the hand of the Special Commissioner appointed to exercise jurisdiction over New
Guinea and certain portions of the Western Pacific.
I have, &c.

Telegram from Acting Colonial Secretary to the Agent General, London.
January 28, 1885.
Have seen and conferred with General Scratchley, whose position is much embarrassed,
first, by misconception on part of Imperial Government that the cost of his establishment
is to be exclusively borne by Australian Colonies, and, second, by no provision having
been made for his transport to the scene of his Government. We have informed him that
our share of the 15,000/. provided by the Colonies for this year can be had by him at
once, and that we are prepared to submit a proposal for increased contribution if such a
course is acceptable to other Australian Colonies and if fair share of such contribution is
paid by Imperial Government. To surmount by temporary arrangement difficulty of
transport we have to-day offered General Scratchley the use of the “ Wolverene” for a
period of six months, this Colony maintaining the ship in her present condition. This
offer has been gratefully accepted, and the vessel will be shortly placed at Genera]
Scratchley’s disposal,


Enclosure 2 in No. 51.
The New Guinea Annexation and Contribution of the Colonies towards Cost
incurred in connexion therewith.
January 28, 1885.
The Cabinet has had under its consideration the position of Major-General Scratchley,
with whom I have had several interviews, the substance of which 1 have indicated to my
colleagues, some of whom have also met General Scratchley, and have had the
advantage of discussing with him the circumstances surrounding his present position.
It has been explained to him that it was never understood by the Colonies represented at
the Convention that the sole cost of the maintenance of the Protectorate should devolve
on the Colonies, but on the contrary the provision made by the Colonies during the year
ending June 1885, was to be supplementary to the action of the Imperial Government
in providing what was essential for the expenses of the Protectorate.
It never was supposed that any such view as that expressed in Section 5 of the Letter
of Instructions of the Colonial Office to General Scratchley would be taken by the
Imperial Government, and that no portion of the expense on an Imperial undertaking
was to be borne by the mother country. The Cabinet is quite unable to adopt any
course of action which would appear to sanction such an entire misconception of the
course of the Colonies as is therein expressed, and desires that it may be distinctly under-
stood that no action on its part can take place on this assumption so totally at variance
with the Resolution by which the Colony pledged itself to its share of the costs to be
incurred in giving effect to the objects of the Convention,
As it seems that owing to this misunderstanding General Scratchley’s movements
have been much embarrassed, and as the Government of this country is sincerely anxious
to obviate as far as possible any difficulties which may arise in giving immediate effect
to the course which the Imperial Government has taken, the Cabinet has intimated to
General Scratchley that the Government of this country is prepared to pay whenever
called upon its proportion of the 15,000/. provided for the year ending in June 1885 ;
and that it is also prepared to make provision for the proportionate increase of this
contribution should a similar coarse be taken by the other Australian Colonies. This
increased contribution will be also dependent upon a provision being made by the
Imperial Government to take its fair share of the necessary expenditure. As the imme-
diate difficulty experienced by General Scratchley is one of transport to his seat of
authority, the Cabinet has to-day offered to him for a period of six months the use of
the steamship “ Wolverene,” which in her present condition and with the complement of
men now in charge of the vessel the Government will maintain at its cost for the time
indicated. Should General Scratchley require, as is probable, an increase of officers
and crew the cost will be borne by him out of the funds at his disposal for the effective
establishment of his authority. General Scratchley has accepted this offer, and the
vessel will be shortly ready to receive him. The Cabinet desires that the Imperial
Government ana the other Australian Colonies should be at once informed of this
action on the part of this Government.

The Foreign Mission Board of the United Presbyterian Church venture to
approach your Lordship to solicit your Lordship’s good offices and the good
offices of Her Majesty’s Government on behalf of the New Hebrides and Solomon
Islands.
We have heard with much concern that there is on the part of the French Government
some intention to annex these islands, and to send thither their criminal and convict
population. Deeply interested as we are in the work of foreign missions, we cannot but
contemplate such an intention on the part of the French with alarm in view of the
acknowledged evils which have followed their entrance into other islands in former days.
We take leave to call your Lordship’s attention to the fact that the churches and
missionary societies of Great Britain have expended 160,000/., and many valuables lives,
upon mission work in these islands, and that all the civilization that has come to them
has been introduced through the labours of the missionaries. We have reason to fear
that much of the good that has been accomplished in the past will be completely undone
if the intentions of the French Government are carried out in regard to these islands.
We trust your Lordship and Her Majesty’s Government will make every effort. to
secure that the agreement which we understand subsists between France and Her
Majesty’s Government in regard to the New Hebrides and Solomon Islands shall be
respected and if necessary confirmed.
I have, &c.

portation of habitual criminals to New Caledonia, and recording the substance of a
conversation which has taken place between M. Jules Ferry and himself upon this
subject.

Colonies.

Enclosure in No. 57.
My Lord, Paris, March 18, 1885.
With your Despatch of the day before yesterday your Lordship did me the
honour to send me a copy of a letter on the subject of the Habitual Criminals Bill,
which was addressed on the 25th ultimo by the Agents-General of the Australian
Colonies to Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for the Colonial Department.
I went this afternoon to M, Jules Ferry and told him that in pursuance of instructions
from your Lordship I had come to appeal to him once more against the transportation
of habitual criminals to New Caledonia. I said that I had seen with great satisfaction
that the Bill, as amended by the Senate, left the selection of the places to which these
criminals were to be transported absolutely in the hands of the Executive Government,
and I added that this being the case I could not help hoping that in the interest of the
Australian Colonies, and for the better preservation of peace and order in the Pacific,
the French Government would be willing to come to an understanding with the
Government of Her Majesty that New Caledonia shall not be chosen as one of the
places.
I argued that the proceedings in the Senate Committee and in the Senate itself
showed that there was in truth no room in New Caledonia for the relapsed criminals,
that their presence would be hurtful to the Colony, and that it was far from being
desired by the French colonists themselves. I used the arguments set forth in the letter
of the Agents-General, as well as those suggested by my own acquaintance with the
subject. 1 pointed out in particular that in the confident hope that their remonstrances
would be considered by the great and friendly nation of France, the Australian Colonies
had hitherto refrained from adopting legislative measures for self-protection. It would,
I said, be a matter for deep regret if the very satisfactory growth of commercial inter-
course between Prance and the British Colonies were to be checked by such
measures. The Australian Colonists desired nothing better than to live in cordial
friendship with their French neighbours in New Caledonia, and to see that French
possession flourish. It was now, I observed, entirely within the power of the French
Government to strengthen these good dispositions, and to relieve the alarm and anxiety
which the Bill had caused. Nothing more was wanted than an assurance, which as
matters now stood would entail no sacrifice, a promise in fact, or an understanding, that
relapsed criminals should not be sent to New Caledonia.
M. Jules Ferry replied that it would be difficult to avoid sending some few “ reci-
divistes” to New Caledonia, but that it was far from being intended by the French
Government that that should be the principal place of transportation. On the con-
trary the number would be small, and the individuals would be selected from classes
not likely to be dangerous. It was moreover to be remembered that under the Bill,
* No. 52.
u 16272. M


as amended by the Senate, the relegated “ recidivistes ” would be subjected to restraint,
and would be under strict control. Under these circumstances, he could not conceive
that their presence in New Caledonia would be a greater inconvenience to the Australian
Colonies than was'that of the ordinary criminals already transported to that French
possession.
I observed to M. Jules Ferry that I had from time to time furnished him with
evidence that the transportation of ordinary criminals to New Caledonia had been pro-
ductive of evil consequences to Australia, and I urged that if the number of habitual
criminals sent to New Caledonia was in fact to be very small, it could not be a very
great sacrifice to give up sending any at all thither.
After some further discussion M. Jules Ferry said that I could not fail to understand
that, as a matter of principle, the French Government could not abdicate its freedom of
action with regard to a French Colony by an engagement with a foreign power.
I begged M. Ferry, nevertheless, to bear in mind the representation I had just made
by your Lordship’s order; and in order that it might serve as a memento 1 put into
his hands a paper giving in a few lines the substance of the last paragraph of your
Lordship’s Despatch.
The Habitual Criminals Bill as amended by the Senate was brought back to the
Chamber of Deputies the day before yesterday by the Minister of the Interior.

I have this day received the enclosed Memorandum from Mr. Service with the

which your Lordship has requested the Colonics should provide towards the expenses
connected with the British Protectorate which has recently been extended over part of

Enclosure in No. 59. /
Memorandum for his Excellency the Governor.
Premier’s Office, Melbourne,
February 6, 1885.
Mr. Service has the honour to return Lord Derby’s letter of 10th November, covering
a copy of the instructions issued to Major-General Scratchley, as Special Commissioner
for the Protectorate in New Guinea, and in doing so would take the opportunity to refer
generally to the position of affairs as regards that island.
In Lord Derby’s Despatch of the 9th May last, the proposal, in behalf of which-the
Colonies were invited to contribute 15,000/., was (vide paragraph No. 5) a protectorate
over the eastern shores of New Guinea. This it was never doubted would include the
whole of that part of the island not claimed by Holland, and on that basis the guarantee
of 15,000/. was accorded. In Lord Derby’s Despatch of the 15th October, however, we
were surprised and disappointed to find that the Protectorate was defined to be over the
southern coast of New Guinea and the adjacent islands, the limits being specifically
given in the letter to the Admiralty enclosed in that Despatch.
Whilst the Colonies were thus labouring under a deep sense of disappointment and
surprise, Lord Derby, on the 30th October, telegraphed to the respective Governors,
asking the Colonies to double the amount of their contributions, and this Government
replied, through your Excellency, expressing great disappointment at the limited area of
the Protectorate, and requesting further information. To this we received a telegraphic
reply, dated 10th November, to the effect that the matter was left to be dealt 'with by
conference between the Colonial Governments and General Scratchley on his arrival.
Under these circumstances we looked forward to the arrival, of General Scratchley
with much anxiety and impatience—feelings which were fully justified by subsequent
events —for, while awaiting General Scratchley’s arrival, we had the mortification of
seeing several of the most important groups of islands, and a portion of New Guinea
itself taken possession of by Germany.
This was a very serious blow to the aspirations of these Colonies, for, by Lord Derby’s
Despatch of the 9th May (vide paragraph 4) as well as by other assurances quoted in
Mr. Service’s memorandum of 20th December, we had been led to believe that the
unappropriated part of New Guinea was safe from the interference of Foreign, Powers.
We had also deemed ourselves justified in hoping that the establishment of the Protecto-
rate over New Guinea and General Scratchley’s appointment were but the precursors of
that larger annexation of the islands of the Pacific which it had been the great object of
the Colonies to secure.
And here Mr. Service would remind your Excellency of the first three resolutions
passed unanimously by the Sydney Convention of 1883, which, ran as.follows
“1. That further acquisition of dominion in the Pacific, southof the Equator,,by
any Foreign Power, would be highly detrimental to the safety and well being of
the British possessions in Australasia and injurious to the interests of the
Empire. • ,
“2. That this Convention refrains from suggesting the action by which effect can best
be given to the foregoing resolution, in the confident belief that the Imperial
Government will promptly adopt the wisest and most effectual measures for
securing the safety and contentment of this, portion of Her Majesty’s
dominions. _
“3. That having regard to the geographical position of the island of New Guinea,
the rapid extension of British trade and enterprise in Torres Straits, the
certainty that the island will shortly be the resort of many adventurous subjects
of Great Britain and other nations, and the absence or inadequacy of any
existing laws regulating their relations with the native tribes, this Convention,
while fully recognising that the responsibility of, extending the boundaries of
the Empire belongs to the Imperial Government, is emphatically of opinion
that such steps should be immediately taken as will most conveniently and
effectively secure the incorporation with the British Empire of so much of
New Guinea and the small islands adjacent thereto, as is not claimed by the
Government of the Netherlands.”
These resolutions express the views of the delegates from all the Colonies without
one exception. It was no lust of territory or expectation of the immediate settlement
of the islands of the Pacific, which led the members of the Sydney Convention to pass
M 2


these resolutions —the object they had in view was to keep the English people in these
distant lands as far removed as possible from the dangers arising out of European com-
plications —and it was as much in the interest of the Empire as in that of these Colonies
that these resolutions were adopted. By keeping the Colonies comparatively safe,
through their very remoteness from neighbours who might through European complica-
tions and Imperial necessities become enemies, the loyal people of Australasia would
have been comparatively free to lend their assistance to the dear old motherland in any
struggle in which she might be engaged. To gain this object any necessary sacrifice
would have been submitted to by the people of these Colonies, and they would willingly
have borne whatever cost it was requisite to incur.
But the position is now materially altered. To our very doors have been brought the
elements of danger and the possibilities of strife, and we shall have to provide against
that danger, and these possibilities, at a cost far exceeding any requirements which could
have arisen under the conditions which the united Colonies desired and prayed for, and
which they were willing to pay for, but which Her Majesty’s Government have failed to
secure.
Under all these circumstances we have had to reconsider the entire position.
The arrival of General Scratchley was of course the proper time to do this, because
from the tenor of Lord Derby’s telegram of 19th November, already quoted, we were
led to believe that General Scratchley would be able to supply us with information
which we had not yet received, and would submit to us some proposals of a definite
character relative to the Council of Advice and the increased contribution. But we
find, on referring to his formal instructions (and General Scratchley has personally
informed us that he has nothing to add outside these), that everything is vague
and indefinite in reference to the responsibilities of the Colonies and the control
of the expenditure. There is indeed, in these instructions, one point made for the
first time so clear that there can be no mistake, and that is, that the Colonies are
expected to pay the whole cost of governing the new territory. Whatever is done, the
Imperial Government will contribute nothing. This, Mr. Service ventures to say, is at
variance with what this Government had the right to infer from Lord Derby’s Despatch
of 9th May, and the ground of complaint now is, not so much on account of the money
involved, for it is not known what the amount of that would be, as on account of the
attempt to cast an indefinite responsibility upon these young communities, the extent of
which they have no means of gauging. It was clearly set forth in the Despatch referred
to, that if the Colonies would contribute 15,000/. England would thereupon take
immediate steps for establishing the special Commissioner’s jurisdiction with a view to
enable him to exercise protection in the name of the Queen over the eastern coast of
New Guinea, but we are now asked by the Imperial Government to do something, they
do not say what, over a territory whose limits are’ undefined, and at a cost which we
have no means of computing.
It appears essentially reasonable, either that the Colonies contributing should have the
limit of their responsibility clearly defined or that they themselves should have control
over the expenditure. But the Imperial Government propose neither the one thing nor
the other. A very few months after undertaking to establish a protectorate over New
Guinea on a guarantee of 15,000/. from the Colonies, Her Majesty’s Government asked
the Colonies to double this amount without assigning any special reason for the increase.
The necessity of providing a suitable steamship for the Special Commissioner referred to
in telegram of 30th October as being partly the cause, and which, if it had been
omitted from previous consideration, might have been regarded to some extent as a
reasonable one for asking for the increased contribution cannot be so regarded, for a
steamer was expressly mentioned in the Despatch of 9th May as part of the cost to be
covered by the 15,000/.; it is not surprising, therefore, that the Colonies, with their
limited means, should desire to know the full extent of the responsibilities likely to
devolve on them.
What then is the exact position of affairs —
1. The Imperial Government have failed in securing to us the main object of their
representations.
2. They have asked us to double our contributions without assigning any sufficient
cause.
3. They have given us no definite information as to the extent of General Scratchley’s
jurisdiction.
4. They have submitted no scheme, not even an estimate, of the probable
expenditure in connexion with the new territory which General Scratchley is to
govern.


5. They have announced, through General Scratchley, without any communication
with the Colonies, to say nothing of their consent, that the whole expenditure is
to be borne by the Colonies.
Under these circumstances, this Government decided, first, that they should place
their share of the contribution towards the 15,000/. for the year ending Ist June 1885,
at once at the command of General Scratchley, which was done accordingly; secondly,
that pending further information they would recommend Parliament to continue said
contribution, but would not be in a position to recommend any increase in the amount
until furnished with the information before-mentioned, without which Parliament could
hardly be asked to vote the money.
Victoria does not desire to deal with this matter in an ungenerous or a niggardly
spirit. In conjunction with Queensland she at once undertook, pending decision of the
other Colonies, to guarantee the whole 15,000/., originally asked frr. And now, although
the chief object of her desires is unattained and apparently now unattainable, she will
not allow any monetary consideration to stand in the way of conserving, so far as it is
yet possible, the future interests of Australasia in respect to New Guinea and the
remaining islands.
But the Government must ask—
-Ist. Whether these Colonies, which are asked to find the money, are to have the
control of the expenditure of the new Government.
2nd. If so, is General Scratchley authorised or will he be authorised to submit an
estimate of the cost of the new Government to these Colonies for their con-
sideration.
3rd. What are the boundaries of General Scratchley’s jurisdiction.
4th. What are the functions which he is to perform outside the strict limits of the
Protectorate.
sth. If these functions are, in any respect of an Imperial character (as we infer them
to be), in contradistinction to matters of immediate interest to these Colonies,
whether it is intended that the burden of those Imperial functions is to be
borne by the Colonies.
In conclusion, Mr. Service has to express his regret that the financial question should
occupy so large a place in this Memorandum, but the foregoing will show clearly
that this has arisen from no fault of ours. From the beginning, the question of money
was a merely secondary consideration with us. If we had secured the island, any terms
that Lord Derby could have dictated would hardly have been criticised.
Mr. Service would also remind your Excellency, so that the attention of the Imperial
Government may not be for a moment diverted by these details from the all important
and engrossing question out of which they have arisen, that the public feeling expressed
in the telegram forwarded to the Secretary of State by your Excellency, at the request
of this Government, on the 20th December, has not diminished in the slightest degree,
but as your Excellency is aware, has gone on deepening and broadening. Mr. Service
feels it his duty to emphasize that telegram now, and to say that the interests of these
Colonies are so much bound up in securing the whole of Eistern New Guinea, that Mr.
Service sincerely hopes that the Imperial Government may yet be able to conserve this
important territory for the Empire and the Colonies.
Mr. Service will be glad, if your Excellency will forward a copy of this Memorandum
to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, by mail, and a digest of it by cable.

THE EARL OF DERBY, K.G. (Received March 24, 1885.)
My Lord, Melbourne, February 7th, 1885.
I have the honour to inform your Lordship that on the 28th ultimo, at a meeting
of the Cabinet at Sydney, the acting Premier of New South Wales offered to place Her
Majesty’s colonial ship “ Wolverene ’’ at my disposal for the service of the New Guinea
Protectorate for a period of six months, which offer I gratefully accepted.
M 3


2. On the 30th of January I sent the following telegraphic Despatch, to your
Lordship.*
3. Having afterwards heard from Mr. Dailey that he had received a cablegram from
the Agent-General of New South Wales to the effect that the Lords of the Admiralty
were opposed to the employment of the “ Wolverene ” on such a service, I forwarded a
second telegraphic Despatch to your Lordship as follows:—“ According to telegram
“ from Agent-General, [the] Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty [are] in opposition
“ to “Wolverene” [being employed]. It is intended provisionally only for [a] floating
“ residence of [the] Special Commissioner and staff, as an emblem of British jurisdiction
“ [and] strengthen authority with the natives. Unless [the Special] Commissioner [is]
“ efficiently supported serious complications with filibusters [may arise].”
4. I was induced to accept the offer of the vessel for several reasons. Mr. Dailey
and his colleagues were strongly of the opinion that it would be a grave mistake for
Her Majesty’s Commissioner to proceed to New Guinea either in a chartered vessel or
in a small man-of-war; especially as the Protectorate had recently been proclaimed with
much pomp and ceremony by Commodore Erskine, R.N. It was urged that the
“ Wolverene ” would be a suitable emblem of British authority in the eyes both of the
natives and the white residents in the Protectorate. Further, a dep6t for coal and
stores and a residence for the Special Commissioner and his staff were much needed
afloat, as it was considered undesirable on the score of health and expense to provide
them on shore.
5. On my consulting Rear-Admiral Tryon on the subject he concurred in my decision
as he deemed it essential that I should have a floating head-quarters somewhere on the
coast of New Guinea.
6. On my return to Melbourne yesterday, I conferred with Mr. Service and Mr.
Colton, the Premier of South Australia; Both the Premiers expressed their satisfaction
at the decision I had arrived at. Mr. Griffith, also, with whom I had discussed these
questions in Sydney, entirely concurred on behalf of the Queensland Government.
7. Before my return to Melbourne’his Excellency the Governor of New South Wales
informed me that your Lordship had confirmed the acceptance of the offer of the
“ Wolverene.”
8. I should mention that I shall require in addition a steam tender to enable me to
visit the coast, as the “ Wolverene” is not suitable for cruising. I am now, in conjunc-
tion with Admiral Tryon, considering how to supply this want.
9. I am aware that the proposed mode of proceeding will be more costly than that
originally intended, and I have been careful to point out to the Governments concerned
that, in consequence of the increased cost, I shall be unable at first to remain more than
a few months on the coast.
10. I estimate that the subsidy of 15,000/. for the year ending Ist June 1885, will
suffice to meet the general expenses for those months, maintain the “ Wolverene ” in an
efficient state, furnish the additional crew required, and leave sufficient funds for the
hire of the steam tender already referred to.
11. I have reported to your Lordship that the “ Wolverene ’’would not be ready for sea
before the end of March, about which time the most favourable season on the coast
commences. This delay will afford me time to visit nearly all the Colonies and make
inspections of their defences in accordance with the request of the several Governments.
12. I have now the honour to submit, for the information of your Lordship, a general
outline of my proposed future proceedings ; taking care to observe that circumstances
may render ,it necessary that I should deviate from the programme laid down.
13. Assuming that I leave Sydney at the end of March, I shall reach Port Moresby
about the middle of April. I will remain there at anchor for about a fortnight in order
to organise arrangements for constituting it the sole port of entry for the Protectorate.
14. I shall leave Deputy Commissioner Romilly in charge of the Port and then pro-
ceed to visit the coast in the steam tender.
15. Should, however, Admiral Tryon so advise, I may shift the “ Wolverene ” to South
Cape, distant about 200 miles to the eastward, where it is possible that the head-quarters
of the Protectorate may be established, as it appears to be a more convenient point from
which to exercise an efficient supervision over the N.E. and S.E. coasts.
16. On my return to Port Moresby I shall decide upon my plans for the future in
order to lay them before the Australasian Governments.
* No. 156 in [C. —4273] February 1885,


17. I wish to avoid as far as possible incurring any expenditure for buildings on shore
although I may find it desirable to erect a small house at Port Moresby for the accom-
modation of the resident officer in charge.
, 18. In the consideration of some of the foregoing points, I have received valuable and
ready assistance from the Reverend W. G. Lawes, of the London Mission Society, who
is at present on a visit to Sydney and Melbourne. I have also been aided by suggestions
in reports received from Deputy Commissioner Romilly.
19- I expect shortly to return to Sydney to settle finally the details concerning the
equipment and manning of the “ Wolverene.” Afterwards I shall endeavour to pay my
promised visit to New Zealand.

Enclosure 1 in No. 65.
1, Clifton Place, Glasgow, W.,
My Lord, March 24, 1885
At the present time when negotiations are taking place between Her Majesty’s
Government and the German Government regarding annexation or protection of New
Guinea and the islands in the South Seas, I take the liberty of respectfully requesting
your Lordship’s careful perusal of the following memorandum regarding Samoa;—
1. From the state of anarchy in which Samoa was a few years ago, it has lapsed into a
state of lethargy, and seems to be waiting in passive resignation for somebody to come
and do something. This is a natural result of what has taken place during the past
ten or twelve years. During that time treaties have been concluded between Samoa and
the United States, Germany, and England, some of the conditions of which are such as to
make it quite impossible for the Samoans to establish any stable Government in the
islands.
Let me give two illustrations of this:—(l.) According to the German treaty “ all laws
“ and decrees to which German subjects and those under their protection resident in
“ Samoa are subjected, as well as all taxes and duties they have to pay to the Samoan
“ Government in accordance with these laws shall only come into force after ratification
“ by the German Government.” This puts an end to all independence of legislation and
necessitates almost every law being sent to Berlin, Washington, and London, for approval,
for the treaty with each of the three powers contains a most favoured-nation ” clause.
(2.) The treaty with the United States provides that no import or export duty shall be
charged on the cargoes of vessels entering or clearing from the Samoa islands, and no
more than \ cent, per ton tonnage duty. ‘ There is, therefore, no possibility of their
equitably raising a revenue.
The Samoans are, for an aboriginal race, intellectually of a high order, quite as much
so as the Tongans and Sandwich Islanders, and much more so than almost any of the
other races of the Pacific, but hampered with such restrictions the establishment of any
stable Government in Samoa is quite impossible. Malieto Lanpepa, the King of Samoa,
u 16272 N


has all along recognised this, and therefore, immediately after his recognition as King,
he and his leading chiefs, as your Lordship is aware; made an offer of unconditional
cession to Great Britain.
2. It is quite impossible for Samoa to remain much longer in its present condition^
The Samoans are sick of internecine strife, and yet there are Europeans in Samoa who
are only too eager to stir up Chiefs and districts disaffected to the Government if they
cannot get the Government to give them their own way in everything.
3. Bather than allow things to drift on in their present wretched state, I desire to
suggest for your Lordship’s consideration whether it would not be much better, at the
present juncture, to get some definite settlement regarding the group.
This might be attained in any one of three ways (1) By the Germans consenting to
let Samoa come under the British flag. This would, in the minds of the Samoans them-
selves, be the best solution of the question. If there be any truth in the announcement
of yesterday’s press that the Samoan Parliament has offered to cede the islands to New
Zealand, it is simply another proof of this. Under British rule, directed from Fiji or
New Zealand, Samoa would be very easily and immediately self-supporting, and I
believe much more than self-supporting. (2.) By allowing the Germans to take the
group. The natives would be very reluctant to agree to this, but I believe, if gone about
in the right way, it would not be. difficult to get them to consent to it, especially if they
were assured by England that this is the only solution of the question. The greatest
objection that I see to this course is that it would be very detrimental to the interests of
Fiji to allow Germany to annex Samoa. Samoa, too, is destined to play a conspicuous
part in the future history of the South Pacific. The islands are high and visible a long
way off at sea, and there are almost no outlying coral reefs which make navigation about
Fiji and Tonga so dangerous. Consequently Samoa is certain to be largely used in the
future as a calling place for trans-oceanic steamers. It would, therefore, be a great pity
to see it in the hands of any other power.
(3.) If neither of the foregoing solutions can be carried into effect at the present time,
and if a resolution to continue the joint agreement regarding this group be decided upon,
I would respectfully appeal to your Lordship to endeavour to get some arrangement
agreed upon whereby the Samoan Government will be enabled to have a fair chance of
establishing a good Government which would command respect throughout the group and
even beyond it. This could only be done by the Governments concerned agreeing to
abrogate certain clauses in their respective treaties with Samoa and substitute for them
a joint agreement giving the Samoan Government more liberty of action. This would
need to be followed up by advice and help being given to the Samoan Government by
the powers concerned. Help, I mean, in the shape of one or two officials being sent out,
with the consent of the Samoan Government, to aid them in establishing their Govern-
ment. This would be a matter a little difficult to arrange, as it would not do to send
out any but good men in whom the Samoans would be able to put implicit confidence,
but I believe some such plan to be quite feasible. If the Samoans saw that a genuine
attempt was being made to aid them in establishing a really respectable and strong
Government, and that England and Germany were honestly lending them a helping hand,
they would, I believe, heartily respond, and a very short time would suffice to see law
and order arising out of the present condition of lethargy, while if things are left alone
they will inevitably drift back into anarchy and civil warfare.
In the foregoing remarks I have left the United States out of consideration altogether,
for, I presume, annexation by them may be considered out of the question, and I do not
think they would stand in the way of any bona fide attempt on the part of England and
Germany to establish a good Government in Samoa.

My Lord, February 10, 1885.
Referring to my Despatch of the 31st ultimo,* forwarded by this mail, con-
firming a telegramf transmitted to your Lordship on that date, I have the honour to
express my regret that I am unable as yet to furnish the fuller explanation promised
in that telegram, which I had hoped to submit now.
2. In fact, that telegram was forwarded to his colleagues by the Premier from
Melbourne (where he then was, on his return from a visit to the Southern Colonies),
and after conference with the leaders of the Governments of New South Wales and
Victoria, with a recommendation that I should be requested to send it to your Lordship ;
I saw no objection to doing so and forwarded it accordingly.
3. I had reason to expect to see Mr. Griffith in a few days afterwards on his return
from Sydney and to learn from him all the grounds upon which the communication
was made, but he was detained in Sydney longer than he had anticipated.
4. I am myself at present residing at Southport for the summer season, and as
Mr. Griffith only returned to Brisbane yesterday and has proceeded to Warwick to be
present at an Agricultural Exhibition, I have been unable yet to arrange to meet
him, but before the next mail goes out I shall have an opportunity of discussing the
matter with him by the light of the information he has recently acquired in the other
Colonies.

Captain Cyprian A. G. Bridge to Rear-Admiral George Tryon, C.B.
Reporting result of visit to New Guinea, Louisiades, &c.
Sir, H.M.S. “ Dart,” January 20, 1885.
I have the honour to report that, in obedience to the directions contained in
Commodore Erskine’s memorandum of 23rd December 1884, I left Sydney on that day
in the mail steamer, and at 7 p.m. on December 30th arrived at Townsville, where I found
H.M.S. “Dart.” At my desire Lieutenant-Commander William Usborne Moore put to
sea the same evening, and passing the Great Barrier Reef by the rarely used Flinders
opening so as to save time, I arrived, after an unexpectedly quick passage in Her
Majesty’s ship under his command, at Killerton Island, on January 3, 1885.
2. As the island was approached the mission teacher came off with a letter left by Lieu-
tenant and Commander H. L. Ross, stating that he had proceeded in H.M.S. “ Raven ” for
the northward and westward, and would probably be back by January 10th or 12th. The
teacher informed me that the Rev. J. Chalmers was on board the “ Raven.” That vessel
being thus fully four days ahead of me, and it having been impossible for her Captain to
specify any point on the little known north-eastern coast of New Guinea at which he might
be found on a particular date, it would have been useless to try and catch her up; whilst
any attempt to do so would have seriously reduced the stock of coal, which, in view of
the service to be executed at this season of calms, it was especially necessary to use
sparingly. Having carefully considered the matter, 1 desired Lieutenant and Commander
Moore to go on at once to the Louisiade and Woodlark Groups, a plan which had the
advantages of exactly conforming to the instructions contained in Telegram No. 29, of
saving time, and of preventing an unprofitable expenditure of fuel. 1 left a letter at
Killerton Island, stating that I hoped to be back there about January 10, intending to
proceed afterwards to Long and Rook Islands.
3. On the afternoon of January 4th, on nearing Brierly Island, natives and some large
canoes were observed on its northern extremity. Lieutenant Dawson and I landed and
found three men —Pa-ta, De-de-wa, and Ta-nai-sai—who could speak a little English.
Brierly Island is not inhabited, but there is on it a beche de mer boiling-house,
belonging, as far as I could make out, to the Greek Nicholas Minister, mentioned by
Lieutenant-Commander J. L. Marx, in his letter of July 1, 1884. Our new acquaintances
informed us that some time ago a two-masted and a three-masted vessel had taken
away a large number of natives. The latter had all gone on board willingly, but
under the impression that they were to be away only two, or at the most three,
“ moons.” None have returned, and the relatives of at least some have blacked them-
selves in sign of mourning. I assured that all, except a few old men and women, had
been taken from Sud-Est Island; but finding after repeated questionings that some
“ men of bush,” or inland natives, are still on that island, with whom our informants have
no relations, and whose language they do not understand-, I believe that what they meant


was that the people belonging to their own tribe who lived on the coast of Sud-Est
Island had been taken away. A list of the men known to our informants carried off in
the vessels above mentioned is attached to this report.
4. At first I intended to go at once to Sud-Est Island, but on learning that the people
just met spoke the language of and were on intimate terras with the inhabitants of the
Calvados Chain, in which the bulk of the population of this part of the group appears to
reside, and also that the Chief of Brooker Island, with several canoes, was at Brierly
Island at the moment, I took advantage of so fortunate a combination of circumstances,
and, assembling as many natives as possible, explained to them the object of my visit.
The three islanders whose names have been given acted as interpreters; They thoroughly
understood who the Commodore was, and appeared to have heard of Queen Victoria,
whom they regarded as the Chief of Cooktown. I endeavoured —not, I think, without
success—to convey to them some idea of the extent of Her Majesty’s Empire, and made
them understand that she was a Chief having under her many “ Commodores.” The
natives were told that the Queen had taken them under her protection, that they must
give up fighting amongst themselves, cease to be cannibals—which they admitted they
were occasionally—and on no account injure white men, but bring any grievances they
might have before the first British officer who might come amongst them,
5. I then went to the village of Varoshia, in the western part of Joannet Island, which
was in a highly favourable position, and, landing, proclaimed the Protectorate and hoisted
the British flag with the customary ceremonies. The villages, though numerous, are
small, and the natives unanimously declared that in none was there a recognised Chief.
Pa-ta seemed to be a leading man, and, with the approbation of his friends, I handed
over to him the flag, and a copy of the Proclamation mounted on a board, and presented
him with a medal. Lieutenant and Commander Moore took charge of the arrangements,
which were very well carried out.
6. H.M.S. “ Dart” started for Sud-Est Island on January sth, but owing to the great
intricacy of the navigation and the unfavourable light, the passage could not be reached
before evening, so she anchored for the night north of June Point. To obtain full benefit
of the light, by steering with the sun in the best position, I directed Lieutenant and
Commander Moore to proceed the next day to Rossel Island, and after leaving that to
go west again to Sud-Est Island. By so doing, the distance, owing to the situation of
the coral reefs, was not much increased, whilst time was saved. Rossel Island was
reached in the evening. I landed at a village, where two canoes were seen, to com-
municate with the natives, who were extremely shy. At first they kept out of sight
altogether, and when they did appear, although I was alone, they remained for some time
on the other side of a small stream. Confidence was soon established, and they
approached, offering cocoa-nuts and receiving a few presents, which Lieutenant and
Commander Moore, who had joined me, helped me to distribute. One or two of them
knew the words “ tobacco ” and “ pipe,” to the use of which most of them were evidently
unaccustomed ; beyond this they were quite ignorant of English, 1 succeeded in making
them understand that in the morning the flag would be hoisted, and believe that they
have a fairly clear idea of the meaning of what we had come to do. The next morning
the Protectorate was proclaimed and the flag hoisted, A copy of the Proclamation, to be
shown to any white visitor, and the flag, was placed in charge of an elderly native named
Nao, pointed out as the Chief, and a medal was given him.
7. A small gap in the fringe reef of Sud-Est Island, opposite which people were seen,
and which was reached on January 7th, afforded a secure but rather restricted anchorage
for H.M.S.. “ Dart,” and it has been named Proclamation Creek. Landing with
Lieutenant and Commander Moore, I opened communication with the few natives on the
beach who had not made off as we got near. At first they were exceedingly shy, but after
a short intercourse became not only friendly but almost too demonstratively affectionate.
To avoid frightening them, I thought it well to rehearse the Proclamation ceremony w r ith
the boats’ crew. They stood the leu de joie better than could have been expected. In the
cool of the evening the Proclamation was read and the flag hoisted. The natives, who kept
in the neighbourhood, came in increased numbers when the ceremony was over. Amongst
them was a man who knew a few words of English. As far as could be discovered, no
one from this part has been taken away in a labour vessel. The meaning of what had
been done was explained to the natives, chiefly in pantomime; by which method
injunctions against making wars and cannibalism were conveyed to them. They
understood what was intimated to them, and certainly approved it, repeatedly saying,
“ Ka-poi! ” which evidently signified approbation, and which happens to resemble the
Maori word for good. The Proclamation and flag, which they had been taught how
to exhibit and to hoist, were placed in charge of a Chief named Ruli-lamu, who, according
N 3


to the Papuan mode of showing friendship, exchanged names with me, and called himself
to the last, and will probably make himself known to future visitors as “ Captain Brits.”
He was given a medal.
8. H.M.S“Dart” arrived at Woodlark Island early on January 9th. Before she
anchored, two canoes containing several natives came alongside, and appeared friendly
and confident. They repeated one or two English words, but communication with them
was difficult. I believed that I had made them understand what we had come for, and
induced them to go and tell their friends. Having given them time to do the latter, and
having seen people assembling on the beach where there were several large and highly
ornamented canoes, I landed at what we found was the territory of the neighbouring
village of Murua. We were received with evident signs of mistrust, which was only
slightly diminished when Lieut. Moore and I sent our swords back to the boat, and when
at the repeated request of the natives I had ordered all but one boat’s crew to return to
the ship. Having distributed a few presents, I told the Chiefs from the village of Murua,
Tu-kun, and Tu-ku-lu, who were present, that I should come ashore again later on and
hoist the flag. On landing the second time some of the younger men showed themselves
unmistakeably hostile, the reason of which we clearly understood when they made signs
of tying their hands and of being dragged on board against their will. They no doubt
supposed that we had come on the same errand as a labour vessel. Some at length were
convinced that we had no desire to hurt them, but there was unquestionably a party
against us. Only a few would approach the spot at which I read the Proclamation and
hoisted the flag, though all looked on from a distance. At last they appeared to be
rather less afraid. It was some time before 1 could induce Ka-la-man, a Chief who
exchanged names with me and to whom I gave a medal, to take charge of a copy of the
Proclamation.
9. The “ Woodlark ” people are the finest and most robust Papuans that we had seen.
They are very wild and appear little accustomed to .white men. Their desire to obtain
“ trade” is so great that, unless visitors are very careful it might lead them to commit
some act of which it would be obligatory to take serious notice. As it did not seem a
good plan to begin protecting these people by shooting some of them they were treated
throughout in a conciliatory manner, and at the same time were restrained from taking
any liberties. I think that we left them better friends than we found them. Cautious
dealing with them will be necessary when any ship goes to their island ; and the larger
the ship and the longer she can stay there the more confiding and friendly they are likely
to become. The “ Dart’s ” rig, notwithstanding her steam power, most probably gave
rise to the suspicion that she was in the labour trade. The people in these parts know
the word “ steamer ” better than “ man-of-war,” at least three steam-vessels, all of by no
means irreproachable character, having traversed the neighbouring waters under different
flags of late years. The Woodlark Islanders are acquainted with Samarai (Dinner
Island) and Basilaki (Moresby Island) and use the same gesture of salutation as tne
people of the latter, viz., pinching first the nose with one hand, and then the navel with
the other.
10. On arriving at Killerton Island on 10th January, it was found that H.M.S.
“ Raven” had just anchored, after going as far to the north-west as Death Adder Bay.
Lieutenant and Commander Ross, whose letter of proceedings will have been forwarded
to you direct, could obtain no information as to the boundary of the German Protectorate.
It became necessary, therefore, for me to proceed to Long and Rook Islands, and also
try to discover the exact limit of that Protectorate. Though the weather was changing
from fine and bright to rainy and dull, the almost uninterrupted calms still continued,
and it was likely that it would be necessary to proceed all tne way under steam. A
report on the coal remaining showed that with care it might he made to suffice. I
accordingly left Killerton Island again on 11th January; I requested the Rev. J.
Chalmers, whose knowledge of the natives renders him an invaluable assistant, to
accompany me, and he readily consented to do all he could to help forward the duty
ordered. I intended to disembark him at South Cape, which place I understood he
contemplated visiting, and to arrange for his conveyance to Port Moresby by either
H.M.S. “ Raven” or H.M.S. “ Swinger ” ; but learning that the westerly breezes were
nearly certain, by the time at which we expected to be back, to have set in with such
force as to render it probable that a gunboat Would have to stretch across to a Queens-
land Port to get to Port Moresby, and would, in any case, expend much coal in
attempting to steam against the wind, I proposed to take him on to a Queensland port,
guaranteeing him a passage back to his station. To this Mr. Chalmers at once agreed,
wishing it to be known that if it became necessary to take him to Port Moresby in a


man-of-war, he was prepared to await the convenience of Her Majesty’s Service for a
reasonable time.
11. As I was on the point of starting from Killerton, I received information that a
white man had landed on Dinner Island, with the object of establishing himself as a
copra trader; that two had landed on Basilaki (Moresby Island) with the same object,
and that a third had stationed two servants, a Samoan and a Malay, on Stacey Island
(South Cape). I verbally directed Lieutenant and Commander Ross, who was going
to visit Dinner Island and South Cape, to convey to these persons a suitable warning as
to the responsibility that would be incurred by any one settling within the limits of the
Protectorate without proper authorization.
12. The way from Collingwood Bay to Riche Isle is full of dangers, and it is sub-
mitted that ships be warned on no account to attempt the passage at night. I reached
Rook Island on 14th January, the fresh north-westerly winds set in the same day. It
may be regarded as fortunate that these winds had not been met with before, as owing
to the necessity of steaming in these unknown reef-beset waters, not enough coal was
left to permit a protracted attempt to get to windward. The “ Dart ” found a fairly
sheltered anchorage on the lee side of Rook Island, inside an extensive series of reefs, the
existence of which seems to have been unknown to former navigators, and on which there
are several islets, some inhabited.
Fleets of canoes, several being large and highly ornamented, were seen approachirg
from various quarters; at one time twenty-one were counted about the ship. The
natives are fine, tall, muscular men. They are evidently almost, if not quite,
unacquainted with white men. Though they had words for tobacco (buasi) and pipe
(baraw), they had no idea of the way to use them. We saw one axe-head, one piece of
iron, and one short string of small beads, all of which they seemed to indicate they had
got from New Britain. They were very anxious to obtain beads, which they called
gim-gim, and tomahawks. The men had waist-cloths of tappa, and many ornaments, of
which the dawarra, or money of New Britain, nearly always formed part. The women
wore pretty grass aprons in front and behind. These people practice circumcision, and
count to five, with a separate number for ten.
13. Mr. Chalmers, whose remarkable power of winning the confidence of and obtaining
an influence over uncivilized people, astonished even those of us who had already some
experience of it, gave great help in making the natives understand what we wished to do.
There happened to be a man from a distant island and three or four men from the oppo-
site coast of New Guinea amongst our new friends. There was absolutely no evidence
that any nation had proclaimed a Protectorate over Rook or Long Islands. The
behaviour of the natives was pretty good evidence that no such Protectorate had been
proclaimed. Had it been, they would have known of it. Accordingly, preceded by
Mr. Chalmers, who went to reassure the people if necessary, I landed with Lieutenant
and Commander Moore at Ove, and hoisted the flag and read the Proclamation. Fully
300 grown-up men were present; and in and about the place the whole number, including
strangers from other villages, could not have been much short of a thousand. The
Chief prepared a mat for us to sit on, and presented me in formal style with a pig,
Agara, though a younger brother of the Chief An-uro, was clearly the most influential
man in the place, and was given a medal and put in charge of the flag. A copy of
the Proclamation was left in An-uro’s house. The natives seemed unacquainted with
fire-arms, and did not even notice our rifles. They also evinced less fright when the
feu de joie was fired than was anticipated. When an attempt was made to show them
how to haul down and re-hoist the flag, they thought it was going to be taken away, and
begged that it might be left with them. They vehemently denied that they practised
cannibalism, and expressed abhorrence of it. After the ceremonies were over many
returned to the ship to “trade ” ornaments, &c., for beads and tomahawks. Lieutenant
and Commander Moore held up a cat for them to see, and excited great astonishment,
which was exceeded by that shown when a sheep was exhibited to them. We left for
Long Island the next morning.
14. Dull weather and heavy rains, during which dangers could not be discerned till
close to, prevailed on January 15th, on which day the “Dart” reached Long Island.
After examining the eastern and south-western shores without being able to discover
any natives, I directed Lieutenant and Commander Moore to return to the southern
point at which I landed, and having on a bluff some 40 feet high above the sea set up a
flag-staff, hoisted the British flag and read the Proclamation. A copy of the Proclamation
was nailed to the flagstaff. ,
15. On January 16th Mr. Chalmers and I landed at a spot on the coast of New Guinea,
which I have called “ Ta Matd Beach.” after Mr. Chalmers’ native name, a little west of
N 4


Fortification Point (lat. 6° 16' S.; long, (approx.) 147° 43' E.; 4 miles W. by N. of FortL
fication Point). We communicated with some natives who live in houses and villages
scattered along the sides of the remarkable terraced hills forming the coast here. They
gave us to understand that no white men had visited any place near, and that they had
seen nothing like a man-of-war; and their situation would permit them to learn what
was passing over a considerable extent of shore. My belief is that no white man had
landed in the country to hoist a flag before I did anywhere east of Cape King William
I therefore hoisted the British flag and read the Proclamation. The medal was given to
Aimd, pointed out as the Chief. On returning to H.M.S. “ Dart,” three canoes belong-
ing to two different tribes of distinct races came from places near Cape Cretin. I could
discover from them no signs that white men had recently been among them.
16. The ceremony at Ta Matd Beach completed the first part of the service on which
I had been ordered, and also that in execution of which Lieutenant and Commander Ross
had been sent in advance. The natives are quite unable to give any idea of the exact
limit of the German Protectorate, and no person qualified to do so seems to have been
sent to or left in this neighbourhood. Whilst off Cape Cretin the weather again became
very unsettled. This added considerably to the difficulties of navigating a ship amongst
an unusually extensive series of reefs, few of which had before been known to exist.
Anchorages in North-eastern New Guinea are rare, and it is occasionally impracticable
to find one when the light begins to come unsuited to progress amongst reefs.
17- I communicated with Dinner Island on January 19th, and issued to the strangers
who had come to settle in the adjacent parts of the Protectorate the warning attached to
this report. It was stated to Lieutenant Messum, who landed, that a white man had
been murdered on an island of the Engineer Group. Lieutenant Messum’s report will
be forwarded in due course by Lieutenant and Commander Moore. It appears from it
that the white man beat a boy, because another boy had stolen a handkerchief. The
parents of the beaten boy assaulted the white man and wounded him with a tomahawk;
he thereupon shot two natives dead. Their countrymen seemed to think that it was
time to stop the homicidal proceedings of their visitor, and one of them, taking a gun
from a Chinaman who was present, killed him. After consideration, I came to the
conclusion that the necessity of early inquiry was not sufficiently urgent to justify me in
delaying the important service on which I had been specially sent, and to complete which
not more coal than was necessary remained.
18. The Rev. Mr. Chalmers, at no small inconvenience to himself, consented to
accompany me to Long and Rook Islands. His assistance was invaluable. I wish to
particularly bring to your notice that the duty on which I was employed was greatly 7
facilitated by the support derived from his being with me. He has declined to allow me
to order any provision to be made for his subsistence whilst awaiting conveyance to Port
Moresby. I regret his determination, as he will certainly be put to some expense
solely because he has placed his experience at the disposal of Her Majesty’s Service.
His disinterested conduct will not, however, surprise those who know him.
19- Lieutenant and Commander Moore showed great zeal in executing the work
ordered, and it is my duty to inform you that the arrangements for hoisting the flag and
proclaiming the Protectorate were admirably carried out under his immediate direction.
He has also collected much useful hydrographical information. The intelligence and
alacrity displayed by his officers and ship’s company were admirable, especially so
considering the incessant hard work and trying weather.
The British flag has been hoisted at seven different places.

Lieutenant Moore to Captain Bridge.
Sir, H.M.S. “ Dart,” Townville, January 23, 1885,
I have the honour to report that I embarked you on the 30th December 1884,
and proceeded to Killerton Island, New Guinea, where you communicated with the
Mission teacher on 3rd January.
You then directed me to proceed to Sud-Est Island, Louisiade group, where we
arrived the following day, and after you had communicated with Brierly Island, brought
to at Feu-de-joie anchorage, five cables W.N.W. of Bounce Point, Joannet Island,
where the British flag was hoisted and the Protectorate proclaimed.
2. The following day, after making an unsuccessful attempt to pass to seaward over the
Barrier Reef, north of the east extreme of Joannet Island, I was obliged to anchor for
the night, three miles west of Bramble Pass, through which opening we left the following
morning. Rossel was reached at 5.30 p.m. on the 6th, and indifferent anchorage
obtained in Dixon Bay, where the ceremony of establishing the Protectorate was repeated
the following morning at sunrise. Weighing at 7 a.m. on 7th, I then by your direc-
tion, proceeded to the north side of Sud-Est Island, and anchored in a small harbour,
which will in future be known as Proclamation Creek. The Union Jack was hoisted at
5 p.m.
3. At 4.30 a.m. on Bth January, the anchor was weighed and course steered for
Woodlark Island. Coming up to the S.E. extreme of Protectorate Reef (the north-
west end of which had been previously discovered by H.M.S. “Cormorant”), it was
accurately fixed. The next morning at 8.15, I anchored in Guasap Harbour. After
some difficulty in explaining to the natives the pacific nature of our visit, the flag was
hoisted, and the Protectorate proclaimed shortly after noon ; and at 1.30 p.m, I weighed
by your orders, and proceeded to Killerton Islands, passing the small cluster called the
Lord Alcester Islands, which were approximately fixed at 6.30 p.m., Cape Ventewat at
9 a.m,, 10th January, and anchoring at Killerton at 2 p.m, of that day. Here we met
H.M.S. “ Raven.”
4. On 11th January, at 8.30 a.m., having embarked the Rev. Jas. Chalmers, I
weighed and proceeded through the Obstruction Reefs to the N.E. Coast of New
O 2


Guinea. On the 12th between 9 a.tn. and noon, a field of dangerous reefs was passed
north-east of Cape Nelson. Again, at 4.30 p.m., we passed close to reefs awash,
hitherto unknown, and I obtained your permission to anchor at 6 for the night, in
preference to hazarding the vessel by proceeding after dark.
Weighing the next morning at sunrise, we found the ocean at 8 a.m. Proceeding as
fast as possible during the day and at very slow speed at night, Rook Island was
reached by noon, 14th. The approach to this interesting island, now under the
protection of Her Majesty, is through an archipelago of small islands and reefs, which
extend 9 or 10 miles to the south, and 12 to 14 miles to the south-west of its southern
coast. Fair anchorage in moderate depth was obtained. Having entered in friendly
relations with the natives, you directed me to land our party at 2.30 p.m. at Ovei, where
the Protectorate was proclaimed and flag hoisted in the presence of large numbers of
natives. You permitted me to remain at this anchorage, in consequence of our entire
ignorance of the ground about to be navigated.
5. On the 15th at sunrise I left our anchorage off Ovei, and proceeding dead slow, found
a suitable passage to the westward by which to gain the ocean, then making for Long
Island, meeting now with heavy rain and west winds, Cerisy Peak was sighted at
1.30 p.m., and after looking in vain for natives on the east and south sides of the island,
you landed and hoisted the flag in a prominent situation over the coast, one mile south
of the remarkable Cerisy Peak, Having embarked you and those of the ship’s company
who took part in the ceremony, I proceeded under your direction to Tamatd Beach,
four miles W.N.W. of Fortification Point, New Guinea, going dead slow during the
night, and increasing the speed after sunrise. Owing to the adverse currents, the
position where the flag was to be hoisted was not reached until 10.30 a.m., 16th.
Having embarked you after the ceremony of hoisting the flag at this spot, I proceeded
by your direction to the southward.
6. The same precautions were observed during our return as on the voyage to Long
Island. A dead slow speed was maintained at night, and the revolutions increased
after sunrise. Special men noted for their excellent eyesight were stationed aloft, to
give warning of approach to danger. I regret to have to mention, however, that in
attempting to extricate the vessel from the bight of a long thin reef hitherto unknown,
in the centre of Ward Hunt Strait, the officer and look-out were deceived in the depth,
and the ship touched the ground at 8.30 a.m., 18th January.
A special report in accordance with instructions is enclosed. Dinner Island was
reached at 1 p.m., 19th January, and crossing the Barrier at 5.30 p.m., I shaped course
for Townsville.
7- I beg to enclose such hydrographic remarks* as I have been able to make during
this hasty cruise. Owing to the necessarily short stay at each anchorage, the weather,
and the various duties which have very fully occupied my time and that of the officers,
these remarks are not as full and complete as I should wish. The following face has, I
consider, been established by the cruise along the north-east coast of new Guinea:—
That there is no route from China Strait to Dampier Strait or Long Island, and that
the only chance of security at present is for a vessel to hug the land, and anchor
at nightfall whenever she may happen to find a suitable spot. Sixty miles a day is
as much as any of Her Majesty Ships could expect to cover on this passage.
The voyage from Killerton to Long Island must for the present be reckoned as six
days.
I have, &c.

Sir, January 19, 1885.
I have the honour to report the following intelligence of a murder at Tupi Tupi,
Engineer Group, as interpreted to me by the Rev. Mr. Chalmers at Dinner Island this
afternoon.
A report was brought by a native called Karepo, who came from the scene of the
murder, that a foreigner, name and nationality unknown, had been murdered in the
* Not printed.


Engineer Group, about a fortnight ago. It appears that the murdered man and another
man, name unknown (since supposed to have been taken to Teste Island by Captain
Miller, of the “ Osprey,” of Cook Town), possessed a station on Onogoosa Island. He
went in their boat to an island called Tupi Tupi to purchase copra; while there a trade
shirt was stolen from him. Shortly afterwards finding a boy “ lurking round ” he beat
him; the parents of the boy retaliated by tomahawking him across the shoulder, at
which he shot'two of them. Another man, Arapatu by name, obtained a gun from a
resident trading Chinaman and shot the foreigner dead, while he was in the act of making
for the boat.
Tupi Tupi is the island, as reported to Mr. Chalmers, from which a number of boys
(young men) were taken by a labour schooner about 12 months ago, to work, as they
were informed, for a period of three moons Tone at sea, two on shore), but they have not
since been heard of, and their relatives have gone into mourning.

Enclosure in No. 74.
Colonial Secretary’s Office, Brisbane,
Sir, February 18, 1885.
Some time has elapsed since the receipt from your Excellency of Lord Derby’s
Despatch of 19th November, forwarding a copy of the instructions issued to General
Scratchley on his appointment as Special Commissioner to exercise Her Majesty’s
authority within the area of the Protectorate of New Guinea, My absence from
the Colony on a visit to Tasmania has prevented me from sooner addressing your
Excellency at length on the subject; but on the 29th of January I sent to your
Excellency from Melbourne, through Mr. Dickson, a telegram which, after much con-
sideration and discussion with gentlemen in official positions in the Southern Colonies,
I thought it desirable should be at once transmitted to the Secretary of State.
2. In Lord Derby’s Despatch of 9th May 1884, after referring to the resolutions
adopted by the Australasian Convention, it was stated that Her Majesty’s Govern-
ment were disposed to think that there should be a High Commissioner, or at least
a Deputy Commissioner with large powers of independent action, stationed on or
near the eastern coasts of New Guinea, and that he should be furnished with a steam-
ship and with a staff sufficient to enable him to exercise protection in the name of the
Queen over those shores ; that the cost of this arrangement could not be accurately
estimated, but that if one or more Colonies would secure to Her Majesty’s Government
the payment of a sum of 15,000/. during the year ending June 1885, they would be
prepared to take immediate steps for establishing the High Commissioner’s jurisdiction.

Very shortly after the receipt of this Despatch the required guarantee was given by all
the Colonies, and the Legislature of this Colony passed an Act making permanent
appropriation of the proportion of the guaranteed sum to be borne by Queensland.
3. No further communication was addressed to the Colonial Governments on the
subject until the 15th of October, when His Excellency Lord Augustus Loftus was
informed by telegram that Her Majesty’s Government had decided to assume the Pro-
tectorate of the southern shores of New Guinea from the Dutch boundary, longitude
141° E. to East Cape, with all adjacent islands south of East Cape to Kosraann
Island inclusive ; that the British Protectorate would extend along the southern shores
and country, the adjacent islands in the Goschen Straits, and as far as Kosmann ; that
no person would be allowed to settle within the Protectorate or acquire land there
unless expressly authorised by the British Government Officer; and that Commodore
Erskine had been instructed by Her Majesty’s Government to proceed at once to New
Guinea to notify the assumption of the Protectorate by Great Britain, and to carry out
the foregoing instructions.
4. A Circular Despatch, also dated the 15th of October, transmitted a copy of a
letter from the Colonial Office to the Admiralty requesting the Lords Commissioners to
take the necessary steps for carrying into execution the decision at which Her Majesty’s
Government had arrived (being that stated in the telegram just mentioned). Lord
Derby added that he hoped to address to your Excellency very snortly a further com
munication in regard to the measures which would have to be taken in order to maka
the Protectorate effective.
5. Before the receipt of this Despatch, however, a further telegram was addressed to
Lord Augustus Loftus on the 31st of October, a copy of which was sent by him to
your Excellency. By this message we were informed that Her Majesty had approved
of the appointment of General Scratchley as Special Commissioner to control the
Protectorate in New Guinea; that Her Majesty’s Government thought it desirable that
the Colonies contributing to the cost of the Protectorate should appoint members of a
Council of Advice in Australia to assist him; that the Admiralty recommended the
purchase of a steamer in England for the Commissioner, at an estimated cost of 16,000 h
or 18,OOOh, to make him efficient; and that the 15,000 L guarantee would apparently
have to be considerably increased. And the contributing Colonies were asked to say
whether they would agree to be represented in the proposed Council, and whether they
would double their contributions for the purposes indicated, with an intimation that, if
not, General Scratchley would have to make the best arrangements practicable after his
arrival in Australia.
6. In reply to this message, I had the honour to inform your Excellency, on the
13th of November, that this Government was willing to be represented in the proposed
Council of Advice; but that with respect to the request for an additional contribution,
they desired to defer giving an answer until they were in possession of further information
as to the intentions of Her Majesty’s Imperial Government relative to the New Guinea
Protectorate.
7. The further communication promised in the Circular Despatch of the 15th of
October was anxiously looked for by this Government, who anticipated that in it such
information would be given as would satisfy the natural desire of the Colonies to know
the position which Her Majesty’s Government had taken up with respect to New
Guinea.
8. In particular, it was expected that they would be informed (confidentially or
otherwise) of the reasons which had induced Her Majesty’s Government to limit the
Protectorate to a portion only of the coast line of New Guinea, to the exclusion of the
interior of the island and of the whole of the northern and north-eastern coast and of
many groups of islands practically forming an integral part of the territory. The
announcement of this limitation had caused much irritation and dissatisfaction, which
was openly expressed in the Queensland Parliament; but it was nevertheless hoped that
when the reasons were stated they would be such as to show that Her Majesty’s
Government had not substantially failed to respond to the earnest wishes of the Colonies,
of the ultimate fulfilment of which they had so far no sufficient reason to entertain any
doubt. It was also anticipated that further information would be given as to the con-
stitution and functions of the suggested Council of Advice, and as to the purposes for
which the additional subsidy was desired.
9. Notwithstanding Lord Derby’s telegram of J 9th November to Lord Augustus
Loftus, to the effect that he proposed to leave the questions of increased contribution
and of the constitution of a Council of Advice for the consideration of the Australasian
Governments with the Special Commissioner on his arrival, it was anticipated that the


announcement of his appointment would be accompanied by some information on the
points to which I have adverted, and also as to the nature of the functions which he was
to exercise in New Guinea, the manner in which Her Majest} r ’s jurisdiction would be
exercised there, the territorial extent over which it would be exercised, the law which was
to be administered, and the Legislative powers (if any) to be vested in the Special Com-
missioner.
10. Up to this time also it had been understood by this Government (as well as by
the other Australian Governments, so far as I have been able to ascertain) that the
undertaking of the Colonies represented at the Convention “to defray in proportion to
“ population such share of the cost of giving effect of the resolutions of the Convention as
“ Her Majesty’s Government, having regard to the relative importance of Imperial and
“ Australasian interests, might deem fan- and reasonable ” (I quote from the sth resolu-
tion of the Convention), had been accepted by Her Majesty’s Government in the sense
in which it was offered, and that the Imperial Government would, upon the guarantee of
the Colonies to make such payment as might be asked, undertake to do all such things
as might be necessary to give complete effect to whatever action might be thought most
desirable. The amount of the contribution has never, I think, been considered a
material element for consideration.
11. It was, therefore, with great regret and scarcely less surprise that, upon reading
the Despatch of 10th November finally announcing General Scratchley’s appointment,
and transmitting a copy of his instructions, it was found that no information was given
upon the subjects on which it had been so anxiously expected, and it was also discovered
incidentally that the Imperial Government expected the Colonies to defray the whole of
the cost of the Protectorate. As I have already intimated, the amount of the contri-
bution has not yet been regarded by us as material; and if we had been informed that
we should be expected to defray the whole cost, I have little doubt that we should have
cheerfully agreed to the proposal. No such proposal has, however, yet been made to us
directly, and if it were made, we should naturally expect it to be accompanied by some
statement of the purposes to which the expenditure was to be applied.
12. Since the first notification of the intended limits of the Protectorate they have
been once formally extended, and the Colonies have .also been informed of Her Majesty’s
intention to further extend them, and more lately of Her intention to annex to the
British Empire the territory included in the Protectorate.
13. These announcements have been received with much satisfaction, tempered by
regret that in the meantime the German Empire has established a footing upon a portion
ofNew Guinea, the whole of which the Colonies so earnestly desired to see incorporated
with Her Majesty’s dominions.
14. The substitution of a direct dominion for a protectorate will, of course, necessitate
a scheme being formulated for the government of the territory. I need not particularise
the many difficult points that must arise and be determined by Her Majesty’s Govern-
ment, with respect to administration. I refer to the matter only to emphasise the
position, that whether the Colonies are to defray the whole cost of the administration, or
merely to contribute to the expenses, they will expect to be informed definitely of the
intentions of Her Majesty’s Government on the whole matter.
15. I have had the advantage of several interviews with General Scratchley in Sydney
and Melbourne since his arrival, with whom, and the Premiers and Ministers of New
South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania, I have discussed these questions fully.
16. I believe that the Colonial Governments would, if requested, be willing themselves
to devise and propose a scheme for the Government ofNew Guinea ; but up to the present
time, with an almost total absence of any information as to the wishes or intentions of
Her Majesty’s Government, this Government feels itself unable to take any step, or
make any definite recommendations to Parliament as to the money which should be
voted towards the expenses of the Special Commissioner.
17. I have addressed your Excellency thus at length, because it seems to me, and to
others whose opinion I much value, to be very necessary both that Her Majesty’s
Government should be in possession of full information as to the manner in which the
question is regarded in the Colonies, and also that Her Majesty’s Government and the
Colonial Governments should each understand the intentions of the other on the
subject.

HON. THE EARL OF DERBY, K.G. (Received April 7, 1885.)
Mr Lord, Adelaide, February 20, 1885.
I have the honour to forward a Memorial from the Presbytery of the Presbyterian
Church of South Australia on the subject of the proposed annexation of the New
Hebrides by the French.
2. The Memorial was presented to me yesterday by a numerous and influential
deputation representing the Presbyterian Church, and a copy of the remarks addressed
to me by the Moderator are forwarded for your Lordship’s perusal.
3. More than one speaker pressed upon me the deep interest felt in the question by
the Presbytery, and I undertook, without, of course, expressing any opinion as to the
probable action of Her Majesty’s Government, to communicate the Memorial to your
Lordship with as little delay as possible.

To His Excellency Sir W. C. F. Robinson, K.C.M.G., &c., Governor of South
Australia.
The Memorial of the Presbytery of the Presbyterian Church of South Australia
Humbly sheweth,
That for a period of more than 20 years your Memorialists have taken a deep
interest in the islands of the New Hebrides group, and have contributed considerable
sums of money for the support of the Mission conducted there.
That about three years ago your Memorialists sent forth a Missionary of their own,
the Reverend William Gray, who has been settled at Weasisi, Tanna, one of the New
Hebrides, and who has laboured there with a good deal of encouragement, the entire
expense of carrying on the Mission being borne by your Memorialists’ Church.
That having learned with much concern that there is a probability of the Islands of
the above group being annexed by the French Government, your Memorialists beg to
represent to your Excellency that such annexation would be unfavourable to the success,
if not to the existence, of the Mission, and to express the hope that those islands should
either be left as they are, or that Great Britain should assume the Protectorate over
them.
That during the last 25 years a large amount of money and effort has been expended
by Englishmen on their Evangelization, and whatever progress they have made has been
under God’s blessing the result of those efforts.
Your Memorialists venture to ask your Excellency to represent • their views to the
Right Honourable the Earl of Derby, the Secretary of State for the Colonies.
And your Memorialists will ever pray, &c.
Signed on behalf of the Presbytery of the Presbyterian Church of South Australia
at Adelaide this 3rd day of February 1885.

Enclosure 2 in No. 75.
May it please your Excellency,
In supporting the claims of this Memorial I refrain from presenting the matter
in any other light than a missionary or clerical one. In these islands of the New
Hebrides the Presbyterian Churches, especially of Britain and the Australasian Colonies,
have already expended the sum of over 150,000/. in civilizing the natives ; none of the
commercial benefit of such civilization returns to the Church, but goes to enrich the
commercial world, especially Britain and her Colonies. Our first and chief interest is in
the natives themselves, and not only have our churches, but also our children, been
taught for years that the New Hebrides are something belonging to them. There is
scarcely a Presbyterian child in Britain or Australasia that has not a vested interest in
these islands of our missions. France has no such claim, nor one penny has she spent
for the welfare of the natives. How utterly unjust then would be the handing over
of these islands to France, taking from us the fruits of our many years of toil and
expense.
But these islands are claimed by us by a stronger and more sacred right than the
expenditure of money. They have been consecrated to Protestant missions by the lives
of the noble missionaries who sacrificed themselves upon these high places of the earth.
They have been baptized to British missions by the blood of such men as Williams and
Harris, the three Gordons, Johnstone, and Bishop Pattison. These islands are sacred to
us as the graves of our beloved, and now to see them handed over to the desecrating
convictism of France is almost too much for our hearts to bear calmly. We cannot
blind ourselves to the fad that the possession of these islands by France means the total
extinction of our missions therein, if we may judge from the result of French occupation
elsewhere. Another consideration is the effect such occupation of the New Hebrides
would have on our communities in these Colonies. It is impossible to imagine the results
arising from a mixture of French convicts and savage cannibals, and this to take place at
our very doors. We are careful to lock up our own convicts; how can we endure then
to have a worse class let loose almost upon our shores ? We cannot keep them from our
Colonies; already escaped convicts have come from New Caledonia and shown them-
selves in our midst to be the worst and cleverest of criminals. Regarding the morals of
our own community we must take strong action in this matter. But what of the wretched
islands themselves ? The opening of the gates of Pandemonium and letting its
inhabitants loose upon them would produce results somewhat similar. The expressed
desire of the natives themselves is to be saved from France and protected by Britain,.
This information has reached us not only through the missionaries but through men
whose eyes are not dazzled by the glamour of sentiment. Mr. Thomas (known as the
“Vagabond”), special correspondent for the “Argus” in these isles, gives us the like
information. The islands are already practically British. The Rev. J. G. Paton, who
has grown white-haired in Christian work in the New Hebrides, and whose life has more
than once been threatened and endangered, tells us that “ till within the last two years ail
“ the Europeans and foreigners on the group were British subjects who earnestly plead
“ for British annexation.”
Such motives as these lead us to approach your Excellency, praying of you favour to
represent our views to the Home Government, and if the Government find it impractic-
able to annex the islands, or even to cast a protectorate over them, at least to “ maintain
“ the statuo quo and hands off all round.”

Your Excellency, Mulinuu, January 27, 1885.
I write now to tell you of our great anxiety on account of the harsh conduct of
the German Consul and the difficulties created by German subjects in Samoa.
Since the day on ■which I first wrote to your Excellency, the German subjects in
Samoa have been increasing in their efforts to break down my Government and to cause
quarrels and disturbances in Samoa.
The most extreme action of the German Consul was taken on the 23rd day of this
month, when he forcibly seized my sovereignty over the municipality of Apia and landed
officers and men from the German man-of-war, who with coloured foreign labourers
constructed a fortification and hoisted the German flag.
I send your Excellency an English translation of the notice sent by the German
Consul to me.
I am not aware that I have done any improper act towards the Government of
Germany. It is solely on account of my love for Great Britain that this has been done
to me by the German Consul, and the German subjects have endeavoured to tempt and
terrify me into altering my mind, but they have failed for my mind is firmly settled.
For this reason the Germans are scheming to frighten my Chiefs in order that they
may depart from my rule and are striving to cause a rebellion in my country. They
have spread a report that Her Majesty the Queen has refused to listen to our petition.
1 beg to remind your Excellency that in my letter I begged that the Government of
Great Britain would quickly send assistance to us, and I now fear that unless assistance
is quickly sent Germany will seize our country.
I therefore humbly beg your Excellency that a British man-of-war may be quickly
sent here. lam sure that on the arrival of a British man-of-war all rebellion will cease,
and it would also be a sign by which it would be known by all men that the British
Government has not forgotten me.
I trust that your Excellency will comply with my petition and that you may be
blessed.

Proclamation posted upon the Municipal Court House, Apia.
Let all the People of Samoa observe. Apia, January 23, 1885,
During the long period that Malietoa has been King the Government of Germany
has been treated with unkindness and injury, all agreements that have been made between
the Governments of Germany and Samoa have been repeatedly violated. For that
reason I must now make arrangements necessary for the protection of the subjects of my
Government and their possessions. This is my view of that which is necessary to be
done, that I should take possession of the lands of the villages of Apia and district, in
which are included Mulinuu and the harbour of Apia, to hold possession under the
supreme control (that was under the Government of Malietoa) for the Government of
Germany.
This is the sign of this. I have lifted the flag of His Imperial German Majesty in
Mulinuu.
This is the meaning of the lifting of the flag—that the Government of Germany will
rule for the present over that portion of territory. Samoans, I tell you now plainly that
it is only the territory that is called the municipality that is taken possession of, but no
other portions of Samoa are taken possession of.
It is good too that you should be made acquainted with the reason of that which is
done. It is no unkindness at all to Samoa. The German Imperial Government only
wish for Samoa to have a strong Government which shall maintain cordial relations with
the Government of Germany.
When a peaceful solution is effected of these difficulties the land now taken possession
of will be given up again.
I beseech you to be at peace and to have confidence in the Government of Germany
and myself, then Samoa will indeed be prosperous.
I am,

I write to inform your Excellency that about 9 o’clock this morning an officer
and a party of marines from the German man-of-w r ar drew up in front of my house.
The officer shouted out my name three times, Malietoa, and said something in a foreign
language which I did not understand. He beckoned with his arm to me to go away. I and
my Government have thus been expelled from our place of Government. Tamasese
(the leader of the rebellion) sent his wife to the Safotulafai Chiefs yesterday, and told
them the result of the meeting which he had held with the Germans on the previous
evening, that we should be driven away from Mulinuu as soon as Tamasese had gone
to Aana, and that on his return in a few days he and his followers would be installed as
King and Government of Samoa.
The statement of Manoo corresponds with this, and he further states that if we do not
go away the Germans will fire their guns upon us.

W. F. D. JERVOIS, G.C.M.G., C.B. (NEW ZEALAND.)
Sir, Downing Street, April 15, 1685.
1 have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Despatch of the 31st
January last,* with its enclosures, respecting the proposed annexation of Samoa.
Her Majesty’s Government have given very careful consideration to the wishes and
representations of the New Zealand Government, and are quite satisfied that they would
have been able to make good arrangements for administering these islands if it had been
possible to entertain the proposal for their annexation by this country.
It was, however, not possible to avoid the conclusion that, even if there were not in
existence an explicit understanding with the German Government that neither country
should annex the Navigators and Friendly Islands, the extent of German interests in
them would preclude Her Majesty’s Government from advising that measure unless
with the full concurrence of the German Government.
The number of German subjects in the Navigators and the bulk of German trade,
are reported to be largely in excess (nearly double) of the British population and trade,
and Her Majesty’s Government cannot but feel confident that the Government of New
Zealand will appreciate the importance, no less to Australasia than to other parts of the
Empire, of recognizing frankly the good claims-of ar great friendly power, and of co-
operating effectively with Germany in the protection and development of European trade
in those places in which either country has such established interests as may preclude
the establishment within it of the sovereignty of the other.

transmitting a memorial addressed to you by the Presbytery of the Presbyterian Church
of South Australia respecting the New Hebrides, together with a paper containing the

I request that you will inform the Memorialists that Her Majesty’s Government will not

their attention, as representing the views of Her Majesty’s Government, to the statement
made in Parliament by the Under Secretary of State for this Department on the 12th

proposal having for its object the annexation of the New Hebrides to France would never

securing conditions satisfactory to those Colonies; and that no Government of this
country would ever think of giving over the New Hebrides to France without taking
care that they would never become a penal settlement.

regards the interior a fair and equal division of the territories should be an ived at by means
of a conventional line or lines to be drawn from the coast boundary to some point on the
141st meridian of east longitude which divides the Dutch possessions from the rest of the
island.
Her Majesty’s Government are now prepared to propose a line which will in their
opinion answer to these conditions. It would run as follows : starting from the coast near

Mitre Rock on the Bth parallel of south latitude it would follow that parallel until it is
intersected by the meridian of 147° east longitude; would proceed thence in a straight
line in a north-westerly direction to the point of intersection of the 6th parallel of south
latitude with 144th meridian of east longitude, and would continue thence in a west-
north-westerly direction until it meets the point of intersection of the sth parallel of
south latitude with the 141st meridian of east longitude.
This line would give an area on the German side of about 67,000, on the English side

I should be glad to hear from your Excellency whether this would be considered by the

Recidivist Bill.
Note —The following precis of the Deputies’ Committee Report, like those of the

interest to Australasia.
F. D. Bell,
15 April 1885.
Precis of the Report of the Chamber of Deputies’ Committee (M. Gerville-Reache).
March 28, 1885.
1. —Introduction.
The Report begins by stating that the Bill had come down from the Senate in order
to hasten and facilitate the reform of the penitentiary system in France ; and goes on to
describe the amendments made by the Senate.
The Senate had seen that the Bill was desired by the whole country without dis-
tinction of political party, and that if it was skilfully applied the measure would produce
a double result; first, that of purging the mother-country of dangerous criminals, and
then that of transforming the solitudes of New Caledonia and the marshes and forests of
Guiana into rich and prosperous countries.
The Committee thought it their duty to remind the Chamber that they had never
ceased to profess the opinion that repressive measures against habitual criminals must
form part of a series of reforms which could only be really effectual if the whole series
was carried into effect at an early period.
2. —Examination of the Clauses.
The previous reports of the Committee had sufficiently expressed their views: they
would therefore confine themselves now to the questions raised by the Senate’s
amendments.
* No. 7.


In the first place, the Senate had suppressed the names of places where relegation
■was to take place. Now on looking at the Senate debates, the Committee observed
that the Government, although agreeing to the suppression of names, had very clear
intentions on the subject, the Minister of the Interior having announced that the
recidivists would be relegated to New Caledonia and Guiana, in the proportion of one-
fifth to the former and four-fifths to the latter.
If the places of relegation were not to be inscribed in the Bill, the choice of place
became part of the ordinary execution of the law, belonging exclusively to the Govern-
ment under its responsibility to the Chambers. The opinions of Admiral Jaureguiberry,
M. Billet, and M. Brun, had led the Committee to invite the Department of Marine
and Colonies to state precisely the number of recidivists capable of being sent to New
Caledonia; but they had never been able to obtain the exact information that was
desired. The Department had always confined itself to giving the area and population
of the island. The figures so given seemed to show that New Caledonia could receive
a considerable number of colonists, whether relegues or free; and the fact that there
was plenty of available territory for relegation was beyond all contradiction. [Here
follow quotations from a report of the Local Commission, dated 4th April 1883, showing
that New Caledonia possessed a large extent of available land, and citing a number of
official facts to demonstrate this ; with the recommendation that a tax should be imposed
upon unoccupied concessions of laud, with the view of either obtaining money for the
Treasury or restitution of the land to the State. The report then goes into long details
with respect to Guiana, and into sanitary comparisons between that Colony and other
countries,]
Whatever might be thought about Guiana, however, and whether that Colony was fit
for relegation or not, ought to make no difference in voting the Bill. As to the protesta-
tions which had been sent in from Guiana and New Caledonia, they had been addressed
neither to the Chamber nor to the Committee. The Guiana protest had emanated from
the Conseil-General; the New Caledonia protest had been made by the Delegate from
that Colony to the Conseil Supdrieur. The reasons alleged against the Bill simply
amounted to a fear that in New Caledonia the relegues, if left to themselves, would
resort to pillage. The protest had concluded with the suggestion that some of the
Islands of the New Hebrides group should be chosen for relegation. This would
certainly be a desirable solution, but it could not be dealt with at all until the inter-
national questions still pending with regard to those Islands had been decided.
The other chief amendment by the Senate related to the regime of the relegation.
Now no question had been more fully considered by the Committee. They had over
and over again called the attention of the Ministers of the Interior, of Justice, and of
Marine, to its importance: and it was upon their proposition, and in absolute accord with
them, that the Committee had pronounced in favour of what had been called the
“ etat de liberty.” The agitation which had since arisen, now imposed upon the Com-
mittee the duty of a complete explanation. [The Report then goes on to describe the
views of the Senate as well as of the Chamber, and to examine in what consisted the
difference between them.] Up to a certain point, even if the views of the Senate differed
in any way from those of the Chamber, that difference was only in a few passages of
their Reports, and existed more in appearance than in reality. The Deputies’ Committee
as well as the Senate Committee had always foreseen that the greater number of releguds
would demand work from the State, and had declared the corresponding right of the
State to lay down the conditions under which it should be granted. Between the first
and second reading of the Bill in the Senate, the Committee of that body had criticised
the “ state of liberty ” as being one resulting from the original Report of M. Gerville-
Reache, and had said they had never been favourable to it; but the Senate Committee
had in reality mistaken the ideas and the wishes of the Deputies’ Committee, whose
Reports had always shown a foresight of the measures that must be taken for the
security of the Colonies, and an appreciation of the duty to subject the recidivists to a
supervision more or less prolonged, before even sending them out to the Colony. They
were to be divided into two series : first relegues who could immediately take up land or
obtain employment for themselves, and, secondly, relegues sent collectively to Colonies
properly prepared for their reception by large establishments as well as a sufficient
number of guards.
The Senate had now, however, gone further, in deciding that reMgues who had no
means of existence should be constrained to forced labour. It was quite understood,
nevertheless, that whenever a relegue could gain his own livelihood, he was free to
dispose of himself as he pleased. The Senate amendment, therefore, only gave the
Q 2


Executive the right to keep in State establishments those relegues who had neither
employment nor personal resources, and was merely the corollary of a duty in the State
to provide a relegue with the means of subsistence. This was really the only difference
between the two Chambers, and the Committee were the more willing now to agree to
the Senate amendment, as their object was the same, namely, to reassure the inhabitants
of penal Colonies, and shelter them from the dangers they feared. It still remained
settled, under the amendment as well as before, that relegation must not be confused
with transportation. The essence of transportation was the entire deprivation of liberty,
coupled with the imposition of the hardest labour; while the essence of relegation was
only internment in some Colony. The relegue would arrive free in the Colony :he would
not be constrained to forced labour if he had any means of existence of his own or could
obtain employment. This must be taken in a sense favourable to the relegue : it would
not be in the least necessary for the engagement to be for a long period, otherwise it
would be a kind of disguised servitude; on the contrary, an engagement might either be
by the year, or month, or week, or only by the day, so long as it was genuine. The
single thing required was that the relegue should show he had means of existence by his
own labour. [The Report then goes on to discuss what would be the most profitable
system of relegation to a Colony, and to give the reasons for so small an amount of
public works having been constructed in New Caledonia or Guiana; also how both
transportation and relegation ought to be put at the service of the penal Colonies, and
the free settlers be preserved from contact with the criminals.]
The Committee had thought it their dut\ r to hear again what the Government had to
say on both the place and the regime of relegation. The Minister had explained that
those of the recidivists who were good tradesmen would be sent to Colonies which ask for
them ; that the great majority would be sent to New Caledonia and Guiana, in two
groups, one being employed in State establishments, and the other obtaining private
employment. M. Leveille, Professor of the Faculty of Law in Paris, who had been sent
to Guiana by the Department of the Marine and Colonies, had returned with the con-
viction that that Colony was fit to receive recidivists; and he would shortly send in a
report to that effect, which the Committee hoped would be made public before the Bill
was again debated in the Chamber. [The report then deals with legal points in various
clauses in the Bill.]
The Committee conclude with the following words : —These, then, are the amend-
“ ments made by the Senate in the Bill, and to these we now ask the Chamber to consent,
“ in order not to expose the Bill to parliamentary delays always too great for the country,
“ whose patience is being exhausted by the offences of the habitual criminals whom we
“ are now asking you to repress.”

With reference to the letter from this Department of the 23rd of March last, I
am directed by Earl Granville to transmit to you herewith, for the information of the
Earl of Derby, copy of a Despatch from Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Paris, recording
a conversation with M. de Freycinet on the subject of the French Habitual Criminals
Transportation Bill.

Enclosure in No. 86.
My Lord, Paris, April 22, 1885.
I observed to M. de Freycinet this afternoon that there seemed to be reason to
believe that one of the first measures which the Chamber of Deputies would be asked to
take up on its reassembling on the 4th of next month would be the Habitual Criminals
Bill.


M. de Froycinet answered that in fact the adoption of measures for removing from
France the “ recidivistes ” was so loudly called for by the country, that the Chamber
would no doubt feel it to be necessary to pass the Bill before the general election, which
must soon follow the approaching resumption of the sittings of the Chambers.
I replied that in this state of things I was very desirous to direct his attention
■without any delay to the very great alarm which the Bill had produced in the British
Australian Colonies. I said that information which I had recently received showed that
the feeling on the subject in those Colonies was quite as strong as ever. I adverted to
the communications I had made regarding this matter to M. de Freycinet’s predecessor,
M. Jules Ferry, and I used to his Excellency nearly the same language which I had used
to M. Jules Ferry, as reported to your Lordship in my Despatch of the 18th ultimo.
I concluded by saying that it would, I knew, be a source of very great satisfaction to
Her Majesty’s Government if he could enable me to convey to them assurances
that relapsed criminals would not be deported to New Caledonia or any other island in
the Pacific.
M. de Freycinet said that, having been a member of the Senate Committee on the
Bill, he was well acquainted with its provisions and with the feeling which had prevailed
respecting it. The Bill as sent down to the Chamber of Deputies left the selection of the
places to which the “ recidivistes ” were to be sent, and the regulation of the discipline to
which they were subjected, in the hands of the Executive Government; and certainly
the expectation of the Senate and of its Committee was that but few “ recidivistes,”
and those few criminals of the least dangerous kind, would be sent to New Caledonia.
I asked M. de Freycinet if the same feeling had prevailed in the Committee of the
Chamber of Deputies, and was likely to prevail in the Chamber of Deputies itself.
M. de Freycinet answered, that however that might be, it seemed probable that the
Bill sent down by the Senate would be adopted by the Chamber without any material
alteration. If so, the Government would have six months from the promulgation of the
law to frame the decrees fixing the places to which the “recidivistes” were to be sent,
and the discipline to be enforced. He would thus have time to communicate with me
in case of need before the points to which I seemed to attach so much importance were
definitively settled.
I begged M. de Freycinet nevertheless to give his attention at once to the represen-
tations I had made, and to bear them in mind when the Bill should come before the
Chamber.

which, with reference to the contents of your Excellency’s note of the 16th ultimo,* the
proposal of Her Majesty’s Government with regard to the settlement of the boundaries
of the German and British possessions in New Guinea is communicated.
This proposal is to the effect that the point on the north-east coast of New Guinea,
where the Bth parallel of south latitude cuts the coast, should form the boundary, and
that the line described as under should determine the boundaries inland of the respective
territories.
Starting from the coast in the neighbourhood of Mitre Rock on the Bth parallel of
south latitude, and following this parallel to the point where it is cut by the 147th degree
of east longitude, then in a strait line in a north-westerly direction to the point where the
6th parallel of south latitude cuts the 144th degree of east longitude, and continuing in
a west-north-westerly direction to the point of intersection of the sth parallel of south
latitude, and of the 141st degree of east longitude.
Having submitted the above proposal for regulating the boundary to my Govern-
ment, I am empowered to announce the acceptance of it on the part of the Imperial
Government.

MAJOR-GENERAL P. H. SCRATCHLEY, C.M.G. (NEW GUINEA), to the RIGHT HON.
THE EARL OF DERBY, K.G. (Received May 6, 1885).
My Lord, Melbourne, March 13, 1385.
In my Despatch of the 24th ultimo, * I forwarded to your Lordship a memo-
randum from Mr. N. de Miklouho-Maclay, relating to that portion of the coast of New
Guinea to which he lays claim.
2. On the 6th instant, Mr. Maclay called upon me at Sydney for the purpose of
drawing ray attention to the following telegram in that morning’s paper: —
“ A German South Sea Company will govern the German portion of New Guinea
“ under an Imperial Charter.”
He subsequently handed me a note of which a copy is enclosed,
3. Mr. Maclay bases his claims to consideration on the following grounds:—
(a.) He has had a small establishment on the Maclay coast of New Guinea for at
least 10 years under the Russian flag.
[h.) He has acquired considerable influence for good over the tribes with whom he
has been connected.
(c.) His objects are of a scientific and philanthropic character.
(i d .) In common with others who have had intercourse with the New Guinea
natives, he takes a lively interest in them, and believes they are capable of
advancement and improvement.
(e.) He desires that the tribes on his coast should not be left to the mercy of
German traders, whom he represents to be utterly unscrupulous in their
dealings with the natives, and practically under no control.
4. Fearing that his claims will be lightly regarded by the German Government,
Mr. Maclay appeals to Her Majesty’s Government for support, and points to the fact
that his upright dealings with the natives are well known to Sir Arthur Gordon and other
Imperial officers.
5. I have refrained from discussing with Mr, Maclay the political aspect of the
question, and have confined myself to assuring him that he would have my moral
support in the event of our being neighbours in New Guinea.
6. Undoubtedly as a civilising agent, Mr. Maclay deserves the strongest support and
encouragement, and I confidently recommend his case for the favourable consideration of
Her Majesty’s Government.

their Lordships have received from Rear-Admiral Tryon, C. 8., in his letter of 14th
March, viz.:—

By George Tryon, Esquire, Companion of the Most Honourable Military Order of the
Bath, &c., &c., Rear-Admiral in the Fleet and Commander-in-Chief of Her Majesty’s
ships and vessels employed and to be employed on the Australian Station.
Sailing Orders.
The vessel you command being in all respects ready you are to proceed in the execution
of the orders you have already received from the Hydrographer of the Navy,
However, since those orders were written some points of special interest have arisen.
On one of these especially it is desirable to have a better knowledge than we have at
present. It is where shall we find the most favourable site for the central administration
of that portion of New Guinea and of the islands over which Her Majesty has recently
established her protection.
My attention has been drawn by the charts in the first place to the geographical
position of South Cape and to the neighbouring anchorages. The lofty mountain chain
to‘ the north appears to be sufficiently near the coast to leave no room for extensive flat
alluvial plains or for large swamps and lagoons, which so often in the tropics are found
at the deltas of rivers and streams, and give rise to causes which are in their effect
injurious to the health of man.
South Cape also may possibly be found to be favoured by the enjoyment of the effects
of local and prevailing winds unsheltered by projecting headlands, &c., possessing a good
anchorage accessible at all times. On the other hand the conditions may favour rain and
a damp, humid, debilitating climate.
Very little is known of the coast, but the evidence of those who have local experience
favours the idea pointed to by the geographical conditions above referred to.
No decision, however, can be arrived at on what is after all the slight evidence we
have at command. It is, therefore, my direction that you proceed to that point in New
Guinea in the first instance, and examine and survey the anchorages in proximity to
that position, and report on them as fully as you are able consistently with the special
object of the service on which you are employed.
With a view to facilitate the receipt of letters, &c., you will take care to send or leave
at mission stations your probable whereabouts up to certain assigned dates, taking care
they are so worded that an obsolete message may not mislead. I will give directions to
the senior officer on the north part of the station, which I hope will be found convenient
so far as is practicable.

The instructions in the station order book with reference to the caution in dealing
with natives, apply equally to Her Majesty’s vessels employed on surveying service, see
Article 134 to 137 inclusive. Further, you are not to land armed men against natives, or
to inflict punishment on them, unless it is necessary to save life ; the captain and crew of a
vessel recently suffered death at the hands of the natives in Milport Harbour, New
Guinea; this might have occurred while you were in the neighbourhood. While any in-
formation of anything you may consider of importance to send me will receive attention,
the investigation or judgment in such cases will usually fall on Her Majesty’s vessels on
this station that are not surveying vessels.
The natives are reported to be very hostile in the neighbourhood of Cloudy Bay.

Sir, Cooktown, February 4, 1885.
In compliance with your request handed to me this afternoon by Lieutenant
Commander Marx, I have the honour to forward you the following:—
I. For the south-east coast alone Port Moresby is the best port.
(a.) It is most central.
( b.) The Motu tribe which comprises,the population there, and for several miles on
each side, is the most important on the coast, and being the principal trading tribe
can communicate further than any other, and holds most influence.
11. Now that the protectorate has been extended to the north-east coast, I think it
may become necessary to have a more central place than Port Moresby, and I should
certainly propose Suan, South Cape.
(a.) The harbour is commodious.
(6.) In all winds it is safe.
(c.) The approach and departure are good at any season.
(d.) Good water can nearly in all seasons be found near to the anchorage.
( e .) The natives all round are particularly friendly, and would willingly help in any
kind of work.
( f. ) Their influence is great on the coast to Orangerie Bay on the west, and East
Cape on the east. It may be I am prejudiced, as it was ray first station on New
Guinea, still I think it the best.
Dinner Island close to China Straits may be as good, and perhaps naval gentlemen
may even prefer it. It-has no good water, and the approach and departure are the
opposite to that of Suan.
It will be found these two places are most central and most suitable.
The south-east coast is the most densely populated, and for working it, whilst paying
heed to north-east coast, Suan I think the best for the Government.
Believe me, &c.

P.S. —Lieutenant and Commander Marx has conveyed to me your thanks. I can
only say if at any time I can be of service to you, I shall be indeed happy to do it.

1. The conditions required appear to be :

( b .) Proximity to the nearest telegraph station in Australia.
(c.) To complete the condition under head ( b) vessels should be able to approach and
anchor at night as well as by day.
(</.) A second anchorage.
(e.) A healthy locality.
2. Port Moresby is in proximity to Cooktown and Thursday Island, but considering
the extension of the protectorate is certainly not central, and no vessel can enter Basilisk
Pass at night without risk unless a lighthouse 50 feet high is erected on the south-east horn
of the entrance, it, therefore, does not satisfy conditions (a) and (c). The north part of
Stacy Island, or South Cape, satisfies all the conditions, except, perhaps, that of health;
out I believe it is as salubrious as Port M oresby, and that if the Special Commissioner’s
house was built on the higher ground, and some of the rank vegetation were removed,
the chances of fever would be reduced to a minimum.
The admirable harbour of Argyle Bay is unfitted for medical reasons only.
3. The following are the approximate measurements of the distances which have to be
taken into account, when considering the communication, postal and telegraphic, with
England and Australia :
4. Between Stacy Island and the main, there is shelter for four of Her Majesty’s
ships.
When the neighbourhood is surveyed the “ Nelson ” will be able to lay there, moored
within one cable of the beach, and to approach from the ocean at night, as the barrier
reef is “ sunken ” off this part of the coast.
It is a “ leading ” wind both ways between Cooktown and South Cape in the south-east
trade, and also in the north-west monsoon, a point worthy of consideration, as both these
winds are occasionally strong. South Cape is 40 miles nearer than Port Moresby to
Townsville. Coal can be landed and shipped at South Cape with facility. The
expenditure of a few gun-cotton charges to remove the coral would improve the point in
this respect.
5. I am of opinion that, both on political and hydrographical grounds, the northern
portion of Stacey Island, or South Cape, is a better situation as a centre for the adminis-
tration of the Protectorate, than Port Moresby.

Sir, H.M.S, “ Dart,” Sydney, February 16, 1885.
With reference to the question you were pleased to put to me this morning
concerning Dinner Island (Samaria), in China Strait, I have the honour to submit to you
my opinion that it is inferior to South Cape as a centre for the administration of the
protectorate for the following reasons ;
{a.) The approach is not so safe for vessels making the anchorage at night.
( h .) It is further from Thursday Island, Cooktown, and Townsville ; and not more
central as regards the protectorate.
(c.) The anchorage is not so commodious, secure, nor well sheltered.
(d.) It is (so I have been told) less healthy on account of the marsh in the centre.


(e.) It is inconvenient as a head-quarters for the Special Commissioner, being too far
from the mainland of New Guinea.
if.) Good water cannot be so easy to obtain.
2. Alluding to Argyle Bay, which you mentioned as one of the sites in the list
adaptable for a centre, I should say it is well suited, from a hydrographical point of view,
being an excellent harbour, and easy to approach at night from the ocean ; but it is not
quite so central as South Cape, and, to the best of my belief, is hot and unhealthy, the
strong south-east wind not being felt on the coasts of the bay.
3. As far as ray hastily acquired knowledge of New Guinea extends, I am of opinion
that South Cape, or, to be more correct, the north part of Stacey Island, is the most
suitable site, in all respects, for the centre of the administration of the protectorate, as it
is central; there is good anchorage, easy of access from the ocean by day or night; it is
fairly healthy, and capable of being made more so, and in proximity to Australia.

Ministers present their most respectful compliments to his Excellency the Governor,
and in forwarding the enclosed memorial from the Synod of the Presbyterian Church of
Otago desire to state that they cordially concur in the request the Synod makes that
the New Hebrides should become part of the Empire.
2. They would point out that this is no new request from the Government of New
Zealand. In 1878 the then Ministry pressed on the notice of the Imperial Government
the desirability of securing these Islands for the Empire. See Enclosures to a Despatch
from the Most Hon. the Marquis of Normanby to the Right Hon, the Secretary of
State for the Colonies, No. 21, 22nd June 1878, and a memorandum from the Hon.
Sir George Grey, dated 6th March 1879, on the Secretary of State’s Despatch of the
10th November 1878.
3. If the wishes of a people, partly civilised through the influence of English people,
ought to influence the decision of the Government, Ministers feel sure that the desire of
the natives of the New Hebrides will not be overlooked.
(Signed) Robert Stout.
The Right Hon. the Earl of Derby, Secretary for the Colonies.
Your Lordship, • February 20, 1885.
The Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church of Otago, New Zealand, as
instructed by the Synod of the said Church, would respectfully solicit the attention of
your Lordship, and of the British Cabinet, anew to the necessity and importance of
Britain annexing or assuming the Protectorate of the New Hebrides Islands, or otherwise
securing their independence.
To suffer these Islands to fall into the hands of any other power, and especially of
France, which seeks to convert them into a penal settlement for its worst criminals,
would seriously affect the interests of the Australasian Colonies, and even of Britain
itself, both in time of peace and in time of war. In time of peace it would expose
the Colonies to the inroad of escaped convicts, whereby their criminal population
would be increased, and as a consequence, a greater cost for protection against such
would be entailed. In time of war it would supply to a foe of Britain a dep6t for
coal and munitions of war, and a rendezvous for ships and soldiers from which a sudden
descent might be made upon British possessions, a danger that would necessitate an
increased expenditure for material and means of war, even in time of peace on the part of
the Imperial and of the Colonial authorities.
In addition to these, the certain results of the occupation of these Islands by France,
the Committee would specially direct the consideration of your Lordship to the serious
effects it would have upon the interests of the aborigines, and in relation to the efforts
that have been made for many years, at great expenditure, by several British and
Colonial churches to educate and Christianise and thereby civilise the native population.
On the one hand, the natives would be exposed to the evil example and influence of a
degraded criminal class, to the frustrating of the good that has been accomplished by
the Protestant missionaries that have laboured among them not without much success.
On the other hand there is the almost absolute certainty that these missionaries, British
subjects, who have opened, by their presence there, these Islands to commerce, and who
alone have done aught to ameliorate the condition of the inhabitants, being, if not thrust
forth from the Islands, so hindered in their work as to render it futile for good to the
natives, as has been the case in others of the Islands of the South Pacific, where French
occupation has obtained, such occupation having had uniformly in its train the domina-
tion of the Church of Rome, ever and everywhere adverse to Protestant effort and objects.
Further, the natives are themselves opposed to French occupation, and are desirous to
be subject to the Government of Britain, and to secure its protection.
In view of these and other considerations that cannot fail to present themselves to
your Lordship’s mind, the Committee would respectfully urge that the prayer coming


alike from the Colonies, the churches engaged in evangelising these Islands, and from
the natives themselves, may receive attention and obtain a favourable response from the
Imperial Government.
Imperial interests not less than the interests of the Colonies and the natives appear to
the Committee to demand that Britain should respond to the call thus addressed to it in
the matter.

Sir, Geelong, March 3, 1885.
We,- the Presbytery of Geelong, composed of the Ministers and Elders repre-
senting the various congregations of the Presbyterian Church in Geelong and district,
desire to communicate to you, and through you to the Imperial authorities, our earnest
protest against any annexation of the New Hebrides Islands by the French Government.
We are sorely apprehensive that such a step would undo much of the work that
British Churches and British missionaries have done at great cost and pains on these
Islands. Many valuable lives have been sacrificed, and 160,000£ have been spent in the
endeavour to give to the islanders the blessings of Christianity and civilisation. As a
result of these labours fifteen islands have been rescued from savagery, either wholly or
in part, and their people live in an orderly, peaceable, and Christian way; and the whole
group have been so beneficially influenced that life and property are now comparatively
safe on them all, and the way is open for sending the Gospel to their 70,000 inhabitants,
R 3


We respectfully submit that work like this is worth continuing, and results like these
are worth conserving, but we are assured by missionaries labouring in the South Seas that
the French occupation of these Islands would be the destruction of our work, and that
the natives themselves deprecate the intrusion of the French as likely to deprive them of
the blessings which missionary work has conferred upon them.
Alike, therefore, in the interests of Christianity, for the furtherance of the Gospel, and
in the interests of humanity for the protection of the natives, we plead for the main-
tenance of the present International Agreement to respect the independence of these
Islands, or else failing this, we entreat Great Britain herself to include them in her strong
and kindly protectorate.

With reference to your Lordship’s Despatch of the 30th ultimo, and to
previous correspondence, 1 have the honour to report that the Habitual Criminals Bill,
as amended by the Senate, is to be taken up in the Chamber of Deputies to-morrow.
I have the honour to transmit herewith to your Lordship copies of the Report* of the
Committee of the Chamber of Deputies on the Amended Bill. After conferring during
the last few days with the new Minister of the Interior, M. Allain Targe, the Committee
is understood to have determined to adhere to this Report, and to urge the Chamber to
.assent to the Senate amendments in order to avoid delay.
I enclose also an excellent precis of the Report which has been kindly sent to me by
Sir Francis Dillon Bell, and which gives in particular a very clear account of those parts
which are of interest to Her Majesty’s Australasian Colonies.
I take from this precis the following translation of the concluding words of the
Report: —
‘ “ These then are the Amendments made by the Senate in the Bill, and to these we
now ask the Chamber to consent, in order not to expose the Bill to Parliamentary delays
always too great for the country, whose patience is being exhausted by the offences of
the habitual criminals, which we are now asking you to repress.”
It appears that the Government will also support on the same grounds the adoption of
the Senate Amendments and the speedy passing of the Bill.
* Not printed.


I had the day before yesterday some further conversation with M. de Freycinet, in the
course of which I observed to him that as the Bill would leave the choice of the places
to which habitual criminals were to be banished entirely in the hands of the Executive
Government, he might at once give me an assurance that New Caledonia would not be
one of those places.
M. de Freycinet said that the measures which would be taken by the French Govern-
ment would, he was convinced, prove to the British Colonies that there was no real
ground for alarm or anxiety on their part. He repeated that the habitual criminals to
be sent to New Caledonia would be few in number and would be selected from the least
dangerous classes, but he did not say that none at all should be sent to that Colony or
other French possessions in the Pacific.

My Lord, March 31, 1885,
I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Lordship’s Despatch
of 27th January ,f transmitting an extract from a letter from Commodore Erskine
respecting the proposal that natives from New Guinea should be returned to their homes.
2. Commodore Erskine had previously communicated with me upon this subject, and
in December last a commission was issued to Messrs. Buckland, Rose, and Milman
empowering them to inquire into the circumstances under which natives of New Guinea
had been introduced into Queensland. These gentlemen have now concluded their
investigations, which have extended over a considerable time, and, as I am informed,
have involved the separate examination of some hundreds of natives.
3. The Colonial Secretary expects to receive the Commissioners’ Report at an early
date. It will be carefully considered by the Government,- and immediate action will be
taken with respect to returning to their homes any natives of New Guinea whom the
facts disclosed by the Report may show to have been brought to Queensland under such
circumstances as to justily their return.
4. The Colonial Secretary informs me that he regrets to have to add that from what he
has learnt unofficially from the members of the Commission, he fears that a large majority,
if not all, of the natives in question ought to be sent back.

Recidivist Bill.
Notes of Debates in the Chamber of Deputies, on the 9th, 11th, and 12th May 1885,
on the Bill as brought down from the Senate.
Sitting of 9 May.
r A Decree of the President of the Republic was read, designating M. Herbetto, Coun-
cillor of State and Director of Penal Administration, to assist the Minister of the Interior
in the debate on the Bill.
M. Nadaud wished the Bill to be postponed until the penal system should be amended.
It was a sacrilege to pass such an abominable law.
M. Freppel (Bishop of Angers) said that it was evident the Chamber wanted to have
done with the Bill. He was not hostile to its principle, but the punishment of relegation
ought only to be inflicted for grave crimes, whereas it was to be inflicted for offences
bearing no proportion to the penalty.
M. Amouroux said that instead of the Bill being one against relapse into crime, it was
on the contrary one to encourage it. When criminals found that all they had to do in
order to get to the colonies was to commit a slight offence punishable by a year’s
imprisonment the , number of recidivists would increase. The Committee Reporter
pretended that there was plenty of land available in New Caledonia. [M. Gerville-
Reache; No, it was not I who said so, but a Commission which investigated the matter
on the spot.] Well, at , any rate the statement was entirely incorrect, there was no
land there at all; the insurrection of 1878 had taken place because there was none, and
even if only 1,500 to 2,000 recidivists were to be now sent, there would be another
insurrection within three years . • •
M. Leli&vre supported the Bill, and M. Franconie opposed it.
M* Allain-Targe, Minister of the Interior, defended the Bill. The [new] Government
asked the Chamber to vote the Bill. The country had strongly expressed its will that
the “ army of crime ” should be expelled en masse from France. It was not pretended
that the Bill was perfect; it could not even be said to be complete, since it required
executive regulation to make its execution possible. There was an immense task before
the country, of which the Bill was only the first tentative step, and it would require
successive measures, some of which [M. Bdr eager’s being one] were already under con-
sideration. Relegation had been described as perpetual, but it might be remitted after
six yearSi He [the Minister] had asked for power not to apply the penalty in all its
rigour; whereupon it had immediately been said that the Ministry were seeking arbitrary
powers, and the Committee had refused, because the Parliament must soon be dissolved,
and amendments must be avoided that necessitated the Bill being returned again to the
Senate. As to the. cost of,the measure, the Government would have to come for a vote;
but as to the executive regulations he would take the responsibility of them in the
Council of State. What had decided him was not only the desire to carry out thejwill.
of the country, but the impossibility of receding before crime. During two years, in the
central prisons, in the world of vice and of crime, the law had been spoken of with terror.
His predecessor [M. Waldeck-Rqusseau] had cited the evidence of every director of the
central prisons to show how terrifying had been the effect of the announcement that the
law would pass; and if the criminals now heard that it was to be subjected to fresh dis


cussions and delays, there would certainly be a cry of triumph throughout the army of
crime. He therefore called upon the Chamber to adopt the Bill in the shape now before
them, not to send it back to the Senate, not to stop at criticisms about details which
could be easily answered. The law must be definitively settled, so that no one could
ever again put in question the principal of relegation.
M. Perin renewed his arguments in former Sessions against the Bill. The Minister
had just admitted it to be so imperfect that as soon as it was voted he must make another
law himself; and on the day that he tried to apply the law, he would find how impossible
it was, and then public opinion, to which the Government was so imprudently yielding,
would turn against him.
M. Gerville-Reache (Reporter of the Committee) said that the Committee had defended,
at the first and second readings of the original Bill, their designation of the places of
relegation, but the Senate had struck out the places altogether. It was not to the
Committee that the objection ought to be addressed that one place or another was
incapable of receiving recidivists ; the Committee would take no responsibility now, the
places of relegation having been left to the Government alone to decide.
M. Rousseau (Under Secretary for the Colonies) said that although the Bill as
amended did not designate places of relegation, it offered less difficulties than the original
one. The Chamber had originally voted in principle the liberty of the recidivists: under
that condition of liberty the designation of particular Colonies involved manj' difficulties,
as well as fears on the part of the Colonies themselves. But when the Bill went up to
the Senate opinion had pronounced itself in a different sense. The liberty of the recidi-
vists remained the principle, but in its application there must be recourse to internment
and forced labour for the greater number. The Government were not suppressing the
liberty of the recidivists, nor condemning all to a forced internment. All those of good
conduct or who could get work would still be left in liberty and the principle embodied
in the [original] Bill was therefore respected. But as any men who could not get private
employment must of necessity be maintained in some places of internment, these
would be held to labour on public works. The Committee’s report had shown that there
were now 100,000 hectares of land available in New Caledonia, which was much more
than sufficient. The discussions had been limited to New Caledonia and Guiana, but
the Government were by no means prevented from designating other places, notably
those accepted by the Chamber in the original Bill. As to Guiana, Professor Leveilld.
who had very adversely criticised the Bill, and who had been sent there to inquire, now
admitted it to be possible to attempt relegation there under prudent conditions.
M. de Lanessan opposed the Bill. Free relegation was now given up ; they all knew
it was impossible to transport, either to New Caledonia or Guiana, or indeed anywhere
else, any number, however small, to be free on arrival. The term “ relegation ” was a
mere euphemism. Having renounced the idea'of free relegation, they were now in face of
another difficulty. Of two things one; either they were going to maintain their relegues
without making them work, or they were going to have forced labour, which was the
same as the galleys. It had been said just now by the Under Secretary that the relegu6s
to New Caledonia or Guiana would be free to chose a means of living, and would get
employment if they chose to work. But from the day that the liberes had undergone
their sentence they were free to seek employment, and they could get none. Every
Governor of New Caledonia and Guiana had declared it. Now the liberes were exactly
like the recidivists; no one knew what to do with the lib6r6s because they could not be
held to forced labour, and it would be just the same with the relegues ; they would not
choose to work, and they would get none if they did. The Under Secretary knew this
perfectly ’.veil; and he would very likely be obliged to cancel the agreements made with
proprietors of mines, because they were unable to employ the men placed at their disposal.
Every one knew that there were already too many convicts in New Caledonia; Governor
Pallu de la Barriere had declared that in a few years, and at latest in 1888, she could
take no more. If labour was possible for Europeans in New Caledonia, it was almost
impossible in Guiana; and neither in New Caledonia nor in Guiana could the law be
put in force.
Count Albert de Mun said that surely the Government could not leave M. de
Lanessan’s speech without reply. The Chamber was indeed in a singular position. The
only result of the debate, and especially of the Minister’s speech, was to prove that the
Bill was one that could not be put in force by itself, but must be transformed into another
to be made by the Minister himself. He could understand that the executive regulations
could not be laid on the table at once: but surely the Government had some ideas and
plans already prepared ? Here was a whole population about to be relegated somewhere


in perpetuity, by virtue of an executive regulation of which the Chamber knew not
word. Just now a member of the Government had spoken of M. Leveille’s mission to
Guiana. Now M. Leveille was an opponent of the Bill, and had published some very
interesting articles on the subject; surely his mission must have ended in a report ?
Where was it ? [A member of the Committee : It does not exist.] Very well, then
let the Chamber wait for it before voting the Bill. It was not enough to want to rid
the country of recidivists : it must also be known what was to be done with them ; and
M. had said : “ You want to make a law about sweeping, and you do not know
“ what you are going to do with your sweepings.”
M. Dalattre invited the Government to publish M. Leveille’s report.
The Minister of the Interior: There is none.
M. Delattre: Then let him be appointed a commissary of the Government, to give
explanations at the tribune.
Sitting of 11 May.
M. Pierre Alype said that in Guiana they would not have recidivists at any price.
The Conseil General there had rejected the scheme with indignation.
M. Herbette (Commissary of the Government and Director of Prisons) gave a long
explanation of the penal system in French prisons, and a history of all that had led up to
the present Bill, Relegation differed from transportation, in that every criminal relegated
must have undergone a “principal sentence ” in some penal establishment in the mother
country. Relegation consisted in a state of internment outside Prance, after a series of
previous sentences; it was not, like transportation, a punishment that ought to be
dreaded only next to death. Under existing conditions transportation had been trans-
formed into a kind of impunity. Had it not been necessary to pass a special law to
prevent offenders from getting themselves sent to New Caledonia ? This was because
they hoped to find there comparative liberty, and to create for themselves in a few years
a pleasant existence. When criminals were condemned to reclusion in the central prisons,
they lamented not having been sent as foryats to New Caledonia. Under the existing
conditions any increase of transportation to New Caledonia would only aggravate the
evil, and this had led to the idea of “relegation.” [M. Herbette then explained the
process by which a criminal would incur the sentence]. Relegation being thus made
clear in principle, how was it to be applied ? The voting of relegation entailed a revision
of the whole system of transportation, and an official commission must carefully study
the proper conditions both of relegation and transportation ; which was a work belonging
not to a law but to executive administration. Under the existing law [of 1854] convicts
had been transported en bloc, first to Guiana and then to New Caledonia, without any
previous classification. The course now to be taken would be to examine one by one
every criminal capable of being relegated, before sending him to his place of relegation.
The first thing was to distinguish between “collective” and “individual” relegation. In
several Colonies and possessions there was a scarcity of labour; why not supply this
want by a selection among the criminals to be relegated ? Where a demand existed for
artisans, if some of the criminals deserved to be sent there, why could it not be done ?
There would be a selection made; after which there would remain those who had not
chosen to learn any trade or do any work; this would probably be a large proportion.
What was to be the regime of the relegation ? It was supposed that the Government had
been hesitating between two contrary theories, that of absolute liberty to the relegues, and
that of forced labour. But if the debates in both Ciiambers were examined, it would be -
seen how gradually these ideas had become defined. At first there was the idea of trans-
portation ; then relegation was substituted: the question was how to differentiate
between the two. Now, what would be the position of the relegue? In a number of
cases it would have been marked out for him before he was sent. So long as he could
live by his labour there would be no difficulty ; and as for any who refused to work, they
must at any rate be clothed and fed, in return for which labour would be exacted from
them. Could anyone hesitate at this ? The obligation of the State to provide means of
existence implied a corresponding obligation of the relegud to give his labour. A grave
question remained as to the places of relegation and the establishments to be created.
One thing at the outset was certain, that no one complained of the fate of convicts trans-
ported to New Caledonia; there the country and climate were so favourable that the
fbrgats did not suffer; then if there were a revision of the system, could not room be
found in New Caledonia for relegation ? There was no necessity to give a premium to
assassins by sending them to New Caledonia, while mere thieves were sent to Guiana.
Thus the Under Secretary for the Colonies in the late Ministry had declared, as soon as


the Bill came down from the Senate, that the first effect of the new law would be to revise
the regime of transportation by ceasing to send convicts to New Caledonia who had not
been passed through a careful selection. It had been represented to the Government,
though in an indirect way, that if transportation to New Caledonia was suspended, and
the Colony was reserved for the better class of relegation both “collective” and
“ individual,” the free colonists would no longer be discontented. Suppose that only
those who could be most utilised were sent to New Caledonia, and subjected to labour;
and suppose, further, that in groups, in detachments carefully chosen, certain islands could
be successively colonised by them. He (M. Herbette) did not mean to say that 20,000
could be sent to the Loyalty Isles. But there were other possessions sufficient to receive,
after careful and prudent selection, individual criminals who would not have to be looked
after like the worst class. As for the more embarrassing question of what to do with the
class that would not work, there were other places to send them to besides Guiana.
[Here followed a number of details about Guiana.] As to the cost to be entailed by the
law, the maximum was capable of being pretty closely estimated. An examination made
for two successive years, in all the penal establishments of France and Algiers, of the
criminals who would come under the law, had shown that there would be from 4,000 to
5,000 ; but the tendency would be to diminish rather than increase that estimate. The
Government had now endeavoured to state loyally and without reserve everything that
could throw light upon the subject.
M. Ereppel replied to a passage in M. Herbette’s speech reflecting on certain acts of
the Catholics.
Count Albert de Man said that M. Herbette’s explanations had not enlightened him
any more than he was before. The Chamber still knew nothing either of the character
of the intended relegation or the place where it was to be made. Everything was left
to the arbitrary power of the Executive. The fundamental point in the scheme was the
place of relegation, and on this M. Herbette had said hardly anything. His speech had
travelled over the penal system, which was worthy of all attention, but was not the
question now before them: he had passed more rapidly over the place of relegation than
anything else, though it was just the point on which the Chamber had looked for a clear
and definite statement. There had been a panegyric of New Caledonia, and explanations
about Guiana evidently meant to be reassuring; but nothing had been said as to the
place to be really chosen. Now either the Government knew what they could do and
what they meant to do, in which case they ought to disclose it, or they did not, in which
case the Bill ought to be subjected to fresh examination. What was inadmissible was
that the Chamber, following the example of the Committee, should repudiate its own
responsibility and throw it upon the Executive. It was true that the Government were
ready to accept this responsibility; but the duty of the Chamber was not to abandon it
to them; What had happened about the place of relegation ? At first only New
Caledonia had been talked about, with universal confidence and ardour; New Caledonia
was an El Dorado where the transportation of the recidivists could be made, not only
without inconvenience, but to the great good of both the convicts and the colony itself.
But no sooner was the matter really examined, than those illusions were utterly
dispelled; the Governor had plainly said there was neither room there, nor work to be
found, nor land to be granted. So New Caledonia was given up. Next, the same
hing followed with the Loyalty Isles, the Marquesas, and Phu-Quoc ; then the
New Hebrides were dropped on account of diplomatic difficulties ; and at last they were
in face of a single place for their relegation, Guiana. Guiana alone was hidden behind
all their reticences and embarrassments, behind the silence of the Committee and the
indecisions of the Government. The law had no longer its original character; the
relegue was no longer to be at liberty. This liberty had been the principle on which the
distinction was drawn between transportation and relegation. But difficulties of all sorts
had arisen; the Senate had changed the Bill; the Government had accepted the change ;
and now the Committee had done for the regime of relegation what it had done for
the Colony, it had retired altogether, throwing the whole responsibility on the Executive.
It was a new forced-labour scheme ; relegation had once more become transportation.
It was a pity that the Government would not give the Chamber M. Leveille’s Report:
but happily M. Ldveilld had supplied this want by his own letters, and in one
published only yesterday, he had said, “ I have just come from Guiana, and no
will be employed there because there are no employers. . . . Enforced
labour for those who have no means of existence means a villegiatura for assassins, and
the galleys for vagabonds.” [M. Herbette: An epigram!] No, but evidence which
leapt to the eyes of all, and made every conscience cry out. It was urged that public
opinion was pressing the Chambers. This was the fundamental vice of the Bill;
S 3


they were making a law to satisfy this pressure of opinion, without even, knowing
how they. were going to apply it. Members only wanted, to be able to say
to their constituents, “We have passed a law against the recividists ” ; but they
were doing nothing beyond passing a law which they knew only too well could not,
and which they confessed could not, be put in force. A member of the Govern-
ment had said to him yesterday, “ Give us the law, if only for a moral effect to make crime
recede.” But would it recede ? Certainly not by anything the Government Commissary,
M. Herbette, had said, with his charming pictures of life in New Caledonia, “ rehabilita-
tion ” in Guiana, and confidences about the eagerness of criminals for their own deportation.
That was not the language to inspire the salutary terror in criminals on .which the advo-
cates of the Bill so much relied. The army of crime would learn soon enough that the
law was inapplicable financially or materially, and instead of its intimidating them it would
only give them greater confidence. The Chamber were forging for themselves a worth-
less arm, and could not vote such a Bill.
[Here the cloture was called for: but the President ruled that it could not be put,
because a member of the Government wished to speak.] , ,i : , , .
M. Rousseau (Under Secretary of State for the Colonies') excused himself for making
so short a speech in the debate of the 9th, as he had not expected a discussion on the
place of relegation to be renewed at such length. He had said that it was evident their
difficulties had become less. Formerly a number of places of relegation had been named,
and now there were none; instead of only four, they could choose among all the colonies.
As to M. Leveilld’s mission to Guiana, he (M. Ldveilld) had declared that relegation
could be made there, so that the Chamber was now able to accept Guiana as one of the
places. As to New Caledonia, a good deal of stress had been laid on the reports of
Governor Pallu de la Barriere, But since Governor Pallu had left the Colony, researches
had been made into the question of the available land, and there were 110,000 hectares
disposable for transportation, besides other reserves that could be used later on. Out of
these 110,000 hectares, 10,000 were in occupation, leaving 100,000 available. But he
did not admit that under the existing law any calculation had to be based on the number
of hectares available. As soon as there was power to intern the relegues, which would
be the case with the greater number, they could be employed upon roads and other public
works much wanted in New Caledonia: and perhaps most of the colonies which had
protested against recidivists being sent there, while the fear existed of the criminals being
free on arrival, would accept them now if they were interned and employed on public
works. The Chamber might vote the Bill with confidence that means would be found to
afford that employment.
M. Yernhes supported the Bill. When France conquered New Caledonia it ought to
have been reserved as a penal settlement, and no free colonists allowed to go there. They
should not hesitate to expropriate the landowners in order to place 5,000 or 6,000
recidivists on the land. .
[Here the cloture was again called for.]
M. de Lanessan repeating his former arguments, proposed a counter project.
Sitting of 12 May :
M. de Lanessan resumed his speech in support of his counter proposal.
M. Gerville-Rdache replied that it was impossible even to consider such a counter
proposal, without giving a check to a Bill which had now been debated for more than
three years. If the Chamber entertained it, they would simply say that there was to be
no law against recidivists at all. ■’ ,
The Chamber divided :

I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Despatch of the 13th of
March last,* enclosing a note from Baron. de, Miklouho-Maclay relating to the position
of the “Maclay coast” of New Guinea.
I have to request that you will inform Baron de Miklouho-Maclay that that part of

Protectorate, and that any communication connected with it should be ,made, to the
German Government, to whom a copy of his letter will be forwarded through the

The Petition of the Presbyterian Church of Victoria
Humbly Sheweth :
That your Petitioners have heard with regret and alarm that there is the proba-
bility that your Majesty’s Government will permit France to annex the New Hebrides
Islands, even though annexation may be followed by the transportation to the Islands of
confirmed criminals. Against this your petitioners beg respectfully to protest alike on
the grounds of justice and humanity.
First.—Because the inhabitants of the Islands emphatically object to French authority,
and earnestly desire to be under British rule.
Second.—Because the civilising influences and commercial enterprises that have made
these Islands accessible have been mainly promoted by British subjects.
Third. —Because the action of France in the Loyalty and Society Islands shows that
such annexation would be detrimental to the interests of the Christian Missions already
established on the Islands at a considerable expenditure of money and sacrifice of life, of
which your petitioners have contributed their share.
Fourth.—Because the transferring to these Islands of French convicts would not only
result in serious injury to the natives, but become a source of danger to your Majesty’s
loyal subjects in Australasia.
And your petitioners humbly entreat your Most Gracious Majesty, not only to
prevent such annexation, but to extend to these Islands that protection for which their
own inhabitants are asking ; and so defend them from all other foreign domination, and
secure to them the manifold blessings of righteousness and peace.
And your Petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.
Signed on behalf of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church
of Victoria.

Referring to my Despatch of the 23rd ultimo, relating to New Guinea, I have
the honour to forward, for the consideration of the Government of Victoria, a memo-
randum on the subject of the estimated cost of governing the British territory in that
country.


2. I have forwarded a copy of the memorandum to each of the other Australasian
Governments, and, when their replies have been received, I propose embodying them in
a telegram to Lord Derby, for the consideration of Her Majesty’s Government.
I have, &c.
His Excellency Sir Henry B. Loch, K.C.B. (Signed) P, H. Scratchley.
&c. &c. &c.
New Guinea,
Memorandum submitted for the Consideration of the Australasian Governments
RELATING to the ESTIMATED COST of the GOVERNMENT for the BRITISH TERRITORY.
1. In Lord Derby’s telegram of the 19th February, the Australasian Governments are
invited to confer with me on the following points relating to the management of the
British Territory in New Guinea :
(a.) As to the extent of territory inland which should be annexed.
(5.) As to the estimate of the probable annual cost of governing the territory.
( c .) As to the distribution of this annual cost amongst the contributing Govern-
ments, and as to the arrangements for permanently securing their contributions,
2. The question of the extent of territory to be annexed has been dealt with in a
separate letter addressed to the Colonial Governments. I confine myself, therefore, in
this memorandum to the consideration of the financial questions involved.
3. It is manifestly difficult to foresee what the requirements will be for the manage-
ment of an unknown territory such as the British portion of New Guinea. One
point is, however, clear. The Government must be organised on a tentative basis, and
every step forward must be taken with the greatest caution. The coast must first
be visited, and careful inquiries made on the spot, in order to ascertain the conditions
under which the Government will have to be conducted. Any programme ot
proceedings, therefore, that may be sketched out must necessarily be of a general
character and open to revision; nor is it possible to lay down at present a definite plan of
operations.
4. Although there are but few data to work upon, much valuable information has oeen
given me by Captain Bridge, R.N., by Mr. Romilly, the Deputy Commissioner at Port
Moresby, by the Rev. W. Lawes, w r ho has been long resident in New Guinea, and by a
few traders. The information thus obtained enables me to lay down, with reasonable
confidence, the following programme :
5. In the first place 1 shall ascertain whether it is possible to establish two or more
stations on the coast to serve as centres from which to administer the Government, as
well as starting points for conducting explorations, and from which to maintain an active
patrol along the coast within the limits of the British territory.
6. At Port Moresby and South Cape there are convenient harbours, and the
localities are favourably reported upon. I intend to remain at each place for some
time in order to satisfy myself with regard to them before proceeding to other portions
of the coast.
7. I shall then visit those points where the British flag has been hoisted, in order to
place myself in direct communication with the natives, and by degrees extend my
influence over such portions of the coast hitherto not visited. I will also make myself
acquainted with the proceedings of any whites who may be resident in the island or
employed on the coast, in order to assist them in their enterprises and promote legitimate
trading.
8. With the view of encouraging properly organised explorations, I have been
in communication with the Geographical Society of Australasia, This society has
obtained grants from the Governments of New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland,
and contemplates certain explorations. It further intends to assist with a grant ot
money, Mr. Forbes, of the Royal Geographical Society, who is expected from England
to conduct an exploration of the Owen Stanley Range. These expeditions will be
conducted under my general supervision, and I shall afford them all practicable
assistance.
9. Having laid down the foregoing programme, it became evident that for some time
to come the head-quarters of my Government would have to be afloat, and that I would
require a steamer for the purpose. The question then arose as to whether I could pro-
cure in Australia a vessel in every way suited to the climate and to the work which had
to be done.
U 16272. r P


10. The requirements of such a vessel were as follows
(a.) For sanitary reasons, ample accommodation was requisite for myself and staff
together with a small guard of white men.
(b.) In consequence of the numerous reefs which abound along the coast the vessel’s
draught of water should not exceed 10 feet.
(c.) As coal delivered at Port Moresby costs about 21. 10s. per ton, economical
engines of the newest type, and capable of steaming from 35 to 40 knots for a
consumption of one ton, where required.
11. Aftercareful inquiry I find I cannot obtain in Australia a vessel fulfilling all
these requirements, and I have come to the conclusion that the proper course is to pro-
cure, through the agency of the Admiralty, a steamer from England. In the meantime
I have had to consider how to provide a substitute.
12. Under these circumstances, and with a view of saving time, I was led to accept the
offer made to me by the New South Wales Government of H.M.C.S. ‘‘ Wolverene.”
Arrangements were in progress for fitting out this vessel ready for sea, when the
threatened rupture with Russia induced me to return the ship to the Government, as I
understood she would, under certain circumstances, be of great service to the Colony.
13. I am now endeavouring to charter a vessel in order to enable me to proceed to
New Guinea, and have framed my estimates accordingly.
14. I shall require, in addition, a schooner and a few whale boats for general service at
the stations on the coast. Buildings will ultimately have to be erected on shore to
provide residences for myself and staff, and offices for carrying on the business of the
Government. It is not [intended, however, to incur any expenditure for this purpose
until I am thoroughly satisfied as to the entire suitability of the places selected for the
centres of Government.
15. The foregoing items of expenditure, including the steamer from England, will
come more properly under the head of capital cost. This will necessitate my asking
the Colonial Governments for a lump sum in addition to the annual provision for the cost
of governing the territory. I propose for consideration that this sum should be advanced
by them as a loan without interest, to be ultimately repaid whenever the financial position
of the territory admits of it.
16. Following out these ideas I have framed the estimates under two heads:—
(a.) Capital, or first cost, to be granted as a loan.
(b.) Annual expenditure, to be provided for yearly, for five years.
Th q [first cost includes the purchase of a steam vessel, one schooner, and boats,
together with a provision for buildings and unforseen expenditure.
The annual expenditure provides for (1) Staff and general expenses connected there-
with ; (2) Manning and maintenance of steamer and other vessels ; (3) Coal ; (4) sundry
minor works, explorations and surveys, conveyance of mails between Australia and New
Guinea, contingencies, &c.
17. The details of the estimates are given in the annexed Schedules A. B. and C.
Schedule A. refers to the capital, or first cost.
Schedule B. to the first year’s expenditure.
Schedule C. to the annual expenditure for the four years following.
18. It will be noted that I take into account the contribution of 15,000/,, which is to
be received from the Colonial Governments on or before the Ist June 1885. Thus, I
appropriate 5,000/. towards a reduction of the capital cost, 8,000/. to meet the extra
expenditure of the first year, and 2,000/. to defray liabilities already incurred for
salaries, office and travelling expenses, from 20th November 1884, to 31st May 1885.
19- I have every reason to believe that the estimates submitted will be found to be
sufficient for the next five years. Each year a financial statement, together with a
general report on the government of the territory, will be circulated for the information
of the contributing Governments, in order that they may be kept fully informed of all
my proceedings.
20. To recapitualate, the estimates of my requirements are as follows:— 1
(1.) To meet the first cost 20,000/. as a loan is required, which, if agreed to,
should be guaranteed as soon as possible in order to enable me to proceed
with my plans.
(2.) To meet the annual expenditure of Government 20,000/. is required, which
will become due on the Ist of June in each year.
21. With regard to the question of the distribution of this expenditure, I presume
that Her Majesty’s Government will contribute its share, and that the remainder will
be assessed in proportion to the population of each Colony.

HON. THE EARL OF DERBY, K.G. (Received June 3, 1885.)
Mv Lord, Melbourne, April 17, 1885.
I have the honour to report that, in consequence of the threatened war between
Great Britain and Russia I have returned H.M.C.S. tC Wolverene” to the Government
of New South Wales.
2. I have taken this step for two reasons :
(1.) In the event of war the vessel will be of great service to the Colony in connexion
with its defences.
(2.) It would not be wise to have my head-quarters, in war time, on board a ship,
having the status of a colonial vessel of war, but which was insufficiently armed
and manned for fighting.
3. I am now hastening arrangements to charter a steamer, and when this lias been
done I will report to your Lordship the probable date of my departure.
4. Meanwhile at the urgent request of the Governments of New South Wales and
Victoria I am engaged in connexion with the local defences.

MAJOR-GENERAL P. H. SCRATCHLEY, C.M.G. (NEW GUINEA), to the RIGHT HON.
THE EARL OF DERBY, K.G. (Received June 3, 1885.)
My Lord, Melbourne, April 17, 1885.
Referring to your Lordship’s telegram of the 19th February last* to the
Governors of the Australasian Colonies on the subject of New Guinea, I have the
honour to report that I have personally discussed the several points therein referred for the
opinion of the Colonial Governments with the Premiers of Queensland, South Australia,
New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania.
2. Taking advantage of Sir William Jervois’ presence in Melbourne, I conferred with
him, and decided to defer my visit to New Zealand until after I had been in New
Guinea.
3. Finding that no concerted action was being taken by the Colonial Governments to
bring about a settlement of the matter, I addressed to each Colony twof communica-
tions, of which copies are annexed.
4. In the first communication, which is dated the 23rd ultimo, I ask for the views of
the Governments as to the extent of territory inland which should be annexed.
5. To this communication I have received replies from Victoria and Queensland, of
which I enclose copies.
6. The second communication refers to the estimated cost of establishing a Govern-
ment for the British portion of New Guinea, to which I have not as yet received any
answers.
7. Absence of information in Australia on the following points is delaying a prompt
settlement of the New Guinea question:—
(1.) As to the agreement (if any) with Germany with regard to New Guinea and the
Pacific generally.
(2.) As to the limits of the British Protectorate on the coast and inland, which are
reported to have been settled with Germany.
(3.) As to the amount which the Imperial Government is willing to contribute towards
the expenses of Government.
(4.) As to when the protected territory is to be annexed to the British Dominions.

Enclosure 1 in No. 114,
From Special Commissioner to the Governors of the Australasian Colonies.
March 23, 1886.
In Lord Derby’s telegram of the 19th ultimo addressed to the Governors of the
Australasian Colonies, of which a copy is enclosed, the Colonial Governments are invited
to confer with me on the following points relating to the management of the British
territory in New Guinea.
(I.) As to the extent of territory inland which should be annexed.
(2.) As to the estimate of the probable annual cost of governing the territory.
(3.) As to the distribution of this annual cost amongst the contributing Governments,
and as to the arrangements for permanently securing these contributions.
2. I have the honour to inform your Excellency that I am preparing a memorandum
on the last two points, relating to finance, which I hope to forward for consideration at
an early date,
3. Meanwhile I beg to invite the attention of to the first point,
in order that their views on the subject of the extent of territory to be annexed may be
communicated to me.
4. I am addressing the other Australasian Governments on the same subject, and
when their replies have been received I propose to embody them in a telegram to Lord
Derby for the consideration of Her Majesty’s Government.
I have, &c.
(Signed) P. H. Scratchley.
Enclosure 2 in No. 114.
Memorandum for his Excellency the Governor.
Premier’s Office, Melbourne,
April 11, 1885.
Mr. Service presents his duty to your Excellency and begs to express his thanks for
the copy with which your Excellency has favoured him of the communication, dated
25th March, from His Excellency Major-General Scratchley, the Special Commissioner
for the protected territory in New Guinea, and relating to the management of that
territory.
The Government have had under consideration the questions embraced in the first
point mentioned in General Scratchley’s letter, namely, as to the extent of territory
inland which should be annexed in New Guinea, but they feel that an expression of their
views on this subject cannot be productive of any good effect, for the reason that whilst
they are considering the Secretary of State is taking action without any reference to their
wishes and desires, and because according to the latest press telegrams, the British and
German Governments have already arrived at a decision with regard to the dividing line
between their respective territories in New Guinea.
It is further, in the opinion of this Government, undesirable that they should take
part in any arrangement which may be construed as an admission by them, either in the
past, the present, or the future, of the claim advanced by Germany to any portion of New
Guinea, and if, on the grounds of present political considerations, Her Majesty’s Govern-
ment deem it desirable to fix for the present the limit of the Special Commissioner’s
jurisdiction in that island, this Government trusts that the terms of the limitation may
be so guarded that they may not lead to any relaxation in the efforts which it is presumed
Her Majesty’s Government are still making to induce Germany to abandon her claim to
any portion of New Guinea.

From the Governor op Queensland to the Special Commissioner.
Government House, Queensland,
Sin, April 6, 1885.
I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Despatch of the 24th
(Qy. 23rd) March, in which you invite the attention of this Government to the extent
of country inland in New Guinea which should be annexed by Great Britain.


2. In the absence of any definite information as to the point on the New Guinea
coast, which is to be the boundary between the British and German territories, and in
the absence of any precise knowledge as to the character of the interior of the Island,
my Government think it is impossible to express any opinion as to the best inland
boundary.
3. Queensland, with the other Australian Colonies, has throughout desired that the
whole of New Guinea not claimed by the Government of the Netherlands should be
annexed by Great Britain, and although this desire cannot apparently now be fulfilled
this Government will be best pleased by the extension of the British boundary inland to
the fullest extent that is still practicable.

a telegram from his Government, together with a copy of a Despatch from the
Governor of the Colony of earlier date, reporting the conclusion of the Commission
appointed to inquire into the cases of the natives of New Guinea and adjacent islands
recruited for service, in Queensland, and the result of their Report.
2. Having already fully expressed my views on this important subject, it only remains
for me in reply to state that it affords me the greatest satisfaction and pleasure to hear
that the Queensland Government has decided to carry out this act of justice and
humanity, and I feel confident that it will have the most beneficial effect in our relations

establish a protectorate.

My Lord, Paris, June 3, 1885.
With reference to my Despatch of the 28th ultimo, I have the honour to inform
your Lordship that I observed to M. de Freycinet this afternoon that the Habitual
Criminals Bill having been promulgated on the 28th ultimo, the period of six months
assigned to the Government for framing the regulations in execution of it was running
on. The selection of the places to which such criminals were to be transported was
now, I said, in the hands of the Executive Government. I could not, I urged, lose
any time in again pressing on M. de Freycinet’s consideration the representations I had
* No. 110.

made to him and his predecessor on the importance of not including among those places
New Caledonia or other islands in the Pacific.
I must, I went on to say, repeat that the feeling on the subject in the British
Australian Colonies was as strong as ever; and I could not but confess to him that I
was apprehensive that the Colonial Governments might be led to adopt legislation of a
drastic character, which might have most embarrassing and unfortunate consequences.
A lamentable check might be put to the commercial intercourse which was springing
up between the British and French possessions in the Pacific ; distrust and resentment
might take the place of goodwill and confidence, and a very painful, not to say alarming,
state of things might be produced. I begged M. de Freycinet to be assured that it
would be of the greatest advantage if he would give me with as little delay as possible
positive assurances calculated to allay apprehension in the British Australasian
Colonies.
M. de Freycinet had remarked just before, in speaking of another matter, that he
considered it of great importance that, in dealing with the innumerable questions
between France and England which presented themselves in all parts of the globe, the
two countries should show very careful consideration for each other’s feelings.
Adverting to this remark, I said that it seemed to me that this matter of the trans-
portation of the Recidivists was one to which the principle he had thus laid down was
especially applicable.
M. de Freycinet replied that of course he could not give off-hand any positive
official assurance, but that he would confer with his colleagues, and in particular with
the Minister of the Interior upon the question. v

I have to request that you will publish this arrangement in the Government Gazette

From a separate Despatch which I am about to transmit to you, you will learn the
nature of the negotiations which have taken place between Her Majesty’s Government
and the German Government in regard to New Guinea.
I take this opportunity of observing that, simultaneously with these negotiations, a
prospect has been secured of obtaining the co-operation of Germany in maintaining order,
and enforcing salutary regulations in regard to the labour traffic, purchase of land, &c.,
in the Western Pacific. The negotiations on this subject are not yet sufficiently
advanced to enable me at present to enter upon details; but I have every reason to hope
that an understanding based on sound principles, and making satisfactory provision for
many matters of interest to the Colonies, will shortly be arrived at.

Memorandum for his Excellency the Governor.
The Premier has the honour to return to your Excellency Major-General Scratchley’s
letter of the 25th ultimo, inviting the attention of the Government to certain points
connected with the British territory in New Guinea.
In reply the Premier desires to state that: First, As regards the extent of territory
inland in New Guinea which should be annexed, it appears useless and indeed impossible
to propose any definite boundary while so little is known of the topography of the
island on the one hand, and the nature of the arrangements that have been or may be
made between England and Germany.
As to the estimate of probable annual cost of governing the territory, and as to the
distribution of such annual cost among the contributing Colonies, the subjects are so
connected that one answer will suffice;
Everything must depend on the views of General Scratchley, and it would seem to this
Government that time and experience only can be the guide as to the necessary
expenditure.
As to the proportionate contribution of each Colony towards such expenditure, it
is considered that one half should be paid by the Imperial Government, and the
other by the several Colonies in the manner already arranged, namely, according to
population.
It is evident, however, that this island is less directly interested than the larger
Colonies of Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria, and therefore your Govern-

I have the honour to report, for the information of your Lordship, that since the
arrival of the mail yesterday, via Sydney, a report has been circulated through an agent
of the German Consulate that the Consul’s action in hoisting the flag at Mulinuu has
been approved of, and that it is to remain hoisted.
This report, if true, being so very contradictory to the repudiation of such act as
stated in paragraph 12 of copy of No 25, Lord Granville to Count Munster, that I have

HON. THE EARL OF DERBY, K.G. (Received June 23, 1885.)
My Lord, Sydney, May 8, 1885.
I have received an application, of which a copy is enclosed, from the Agents in
Sydney of the “ Deutsche Handels und Plantagen-Gesellschaft Der Sudsee-Inseln Zu
Hamburg ” for permission to trade with the natives of that portion of New Guinea
which is under Her Majesty’s protection.
2. I have informed these gentlemen that I cannot comply with their request until I
have completed the arrangements for the government of the British Protectorate, of
which due notice will be given them.
3. In view of this and numerous other applications which I am receiving from
Australian traders for permission to trade and lease land in New Guinea, I beg leave to
urge upon your Lordship the importance of issuing the Orders in Council, which, it is
understood, are to be framed in order to confer upon me the judicial and other powers
necessary to maintain control over foreigners as well as British subjects in New Guinea.
4. In the absence of such powers, I am of opinion that it would be unwise to admit
foreigners, over whom, in my capacity as a Deputy-Commissioner of the,.Western Pacific,
I could exercise no practical control.
5. At the same time it appears to me thaHt would be impolitic to refuse facilities to a
well-established foreign trading company, as their proceedings would, under proper
U 4


supervision and restriction, lead to the development of the resources of the island, and
ultimately benefit the islanders.
t). Having informed the Agents of the Company that I had communicated with your
Lordship on the subject of their application, I have the honour to request early
instructions in the matter.

The following arrangement has been agreed upon between the Governments of Great
Britain and Germany as to the boundaries of the possessions of the two countries in New
Guinea. The point on the north-east coast of New Guinea where the Bth parallel of
south latitude cuts the coast forms the boundary on the coast, and a line described as
under determines the boundaries inland of the respective territories : starting from the
coast in the neighbourhood of Mitre Rock on the Bth parallel of south latitude, and
following this parallel to the point where it is cut by the 147th degree of east longitude,
then in a straight line in a north-westerly direction to the point where the 6th parallel of
south latitude cuts the 144th degree of east longitude, and continuing in a west-north-
westerly direction to the point of intersection of the sth parallel of south latitude and of
the 14lst degree of east longitude.
The British possessions lie to the south of the line thus defined, the German to the
north. The British possessions will not include Long Island or Rook Island, or any
islands adjacent to New Guinea to the northward of the Bth parallel of south latitude.

the general economy I have rigidly practised during the last three months, as well as
the specific savings that I indicated to your Lordship in my Despatch dated 19th

of this day’s date,f covering returns of revenue and expenditure for the first quarter
of 1885.

Government House, Suva, Fiji,
Sir, # April 29, 1885.
I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of 12th April, covering
a Memorandum having reference to the financial arrangements proposed by you for
carrying on your Government in the recently annexed territory of New Guinea.
2. I beg to thank you for the courtesy of conveying in your Memorandum such a .clear
and complete outline of the course you intend to pursue in commencing your Govern-
ment, and to assure you that if I can render you any assistance in any way in carrying
out your difficult task, 1 shall have great pleasure in doing so.
3. I observe from paragraph 15 of the Memorandum, that you propose that the
Colonial Governments should provide a lump sum to meet certain initial expenditure,
in addition to the annual contribution. No doubt this initial expenditure is necessary,
and the share of it that would fall on this Colony would be but small, nevertheless, the
present financial position of Fiji is such that the most rigid economy has to be practised
to afford any prospect of making ends meet at the close of the year. It has there-
fore been found necessary to cut down expenditure in every possible direction, and,
as it is probable that our circumstances, owing to the present depression of trade, more
especially in the sugar market, will be worse before they are better, 1 cannot but hope
that it will be found unnecessary to call for any further contribution from this Colony.
4. Of course the final decision on this matter will be given by Her Majesty’s Secretary
of State for the Colonies, without whose directions previously obtained I should not, I
regret to say, under the present circumstances of this Colony, be justified in asking the
Legislative Council for an additional vote this year.
5. I have no doubt that you will see clearly that my unwillingness that any further
burden should be put upon this Colony at present arises solely from the imperative
necessity of practising parsimony in this Government for some time to come.
I have, &c.

Enclosure 2 in No. 128.
Sir, Apia, Samoa, February 10, 1885.
It is the wish of my Government and myself that you be good enough to act
and advise my deputation to the Government of New Zealand in accordance with the
Bill my Parliament has just passed unanimously, a copy of which I forward with this
letter.
The reason I and my Government have asked you to interfere in our troubles is
because we are in trouble through the action of the Germans here, and that Mr. John
Lundon has told us that you take a great interest in the Pacific Island’s people; that
you made large reserves for their use in New Zealand when you were Governor there,
that you got the Annexation Bill of the Pacific Islands passed by the New Zealand
Parliament, and that your knowledge of forming Governments is greater than that of
any other man in the southern hemisphere.
We also see your name in the newspapers as being a great Chief, and that you have
always been a kind father to the natives of the different islands.
I also ask you in the name of myself, my Government, and my people, to be a father
to my deputation, and to give them your advice and experience for the purpose of giving
effect to your own and our Bill, with a view of making the Samoans and New Zealanders
one people.
And may God preserve you to live long, and see the good you have begun accomplished,
is the prayer of your true friend.
To Sir George Grey, Kawau, Auckland, (Signed) Malietoa,
New Zealand. King of Samoa.
Enclosure 3 in No. 128.
Sir, Kawau, New Zealand, April 14th 1885.
I have had the honour of receiving your letter requesting me to advise and act
with your deputation in reference to the business on which it was intended to send
them to New Zealand.
Rest assured that I will advise and act with any deputation that you may send here,
and, in compliance with your wishes, deal with them as a father with his children. If
necessary they shall be cared for in my own house.
In your letter you allude to some of the reasons which made you think it advisable
to send a deputation to New Zealand, as also to the Confederation and Annexation Act
which I introduced into the New Zealand House of Representatives in 1883.
I brought that measure forward because I found that some of the nations of Europe
seemed suddenly actuated by an inordinate desire to grasp territory in all parts of
the world.
It seemed desirable, therefore, that New Zealand, which had for many years held
close relations, religious, friendly, and mercantile with the inhabitants of various islands
of the Pacific, should make an open declaration of the course it intended to pursue in
reference to federation and annexation with any of those islands.
This was done in the Act to which you allude, which virtually affirmed that the
people of all such islands were freemen who had the undoubted right of disposing of
their own future.
It then created means by which any such islands, or parts thereof, might, at the desire
of their inhabitants, federate with New Zealand, or become annexed to it, upon the
assent of the New Zealand Parliament having been obtained.


But the machinery provided to accomplish this object plainly showed that New Zealand
would not recognise the forcible seizure of any island or islands, or parts thereof, as a
legitimate or just proceeding.
The principles embodied in the Act to which I am alluding were almost unanimously
adopted by the Parliament and people of New Zealand. They have been rewarded for
their righteous decision, for two groups of islands have already sought to be united to
New Zealand under the provisions of that Act.
It has been recently stated by r the New Zealand Government that very different
principles are likely to be acted upon by European Powers, that proposals are to be
made by Germany to surrender what she had taken of New Guinea if Samoa were given
up to her.
Ido not yet credit this. Who could venture to say that England or any other
nation had such claims on, or rights over, Samoa, as would entitle it to give up that
country and its friendly people as a payment for territories to be yielded in some other
place over which no moral right of disposal of the land or people had been acquired.
To do this would be to treat you as mere chattels, without rights or feelings. I
cannot believe that any British or German statesman would propose or carry out such a
transaction. Nor do I think that either of those great and generous nations would give
their assent to it.
In the printed telegrams on this subject which passed between the Governments of
New Zealand and New South Wales, I observe also that the only references are to trade
interests, and the control of the Central Pacific, and that there is not the slightest
allusion to the cruelty and unrighteousness of dealing in such a manner, as it is alleged
is contemplated, with a friendly and inoffensive nation.
The New Zealand Agent-General having reported that probably a proposal would be
made by Germany to surrender what she had taken of New Guinea if Samoa were given
up to her, I believe that if the opinion of the people of New Zealand could have been
taken as to the nature of the reply which should be returned to him that the great
majority would have said “ Let him be instructed to inform the Secretary of State that
the people of New Zealand would regard the abandoning of Samoa to Germany, in
exchange for a part of New Guinea, as a wrong and cruel transaction ; that they could
not think that such an arrangement was really contemplated, but that if it was they would
be no party to it.”
Why great nations, each having many millions of subjects, and vast possessions in
many parts of the world, should prevent two groups of islands in the remote Pacific from
uniting to work out in their own way their common welfare and happiness is difficult to
understand. The mutual jealousies of those nations are the probable cause ; but if they
definitely refuse to allow the union of New Zealand and Samoa, then in their mutual
jealousies lies Samoa’s best hope of safety.
In the years 1847 and 1848 I was Governor of New Zealand, and had duties in other
islands in*the Pacific to attend to. It was thus necessary for me to pay great attention
to the capabilities of the Polynesian race. I soon recognised in them many high qualities,
and believed that amongst them were men who could soon be rendered capable of con-
ducting, with the aid of some Europeans, the civilisation of the islands of the Pacific,
especially of those tropical islands which cannot be peopled by a European race. I
thought that to save the Polynesians, to render them a blessing to the entire Pacific, and
to open to their talents and energy scenes of constant activity and employment, was a
task worthy of a great nation.
It was admitted at that time by all who knew the Polynesians well that they were
a brave race, often of remarkable firmness in the midst of great danger. But great
courage under physical danger is often incapable of confronting the dread of a fall from
comparative wealth and comfort into poverty and long continued penury. Amongst the
Polynesians, however, substantial comfort and temporal welfare are often unhesitatingly
given up, and the want of what custom had rendered necessaries is cheerfully undergone
for years for the sake of maintaining what is believed to be a great principle.
Amongst one race of the Poljmesians, that is the Maoris, I have seen as great and
noble characters as I have met with in any society in any part of the world. I have
known Papuans also who exhibited all the traits of thoroughly devoted men. As a proof
of the earnestness and greatness of mind of the Maori Chiefs, I would state that some of
them gave up considerable quantities of very valuable land as endowments to defray in
part the cost of the efforts being made to spread knowledge and civilization throughout
the Pacific.
I have also seen Samoans of high rank undergoing privations of the kind I have above
alluded to with cheerfulness, enduring sickness with resignation in a climate to which
X 3


they were not accustomed in a remote island, far separated from all relatives and friends,
yet still conscientiously discharging their duties as Christian missionaries. The sight of
their exertions in such a cause led me to hope great things from them in the civilization
of the Pacific islands.
The plans formed for that object were, however, always crushed in England, the
reason generally assigned being the probable cost that it would entail. That however
was a mistake, the cost would have been comparatively trifling. Probably there was a
dread that the plans proposed might have led to an extension of the British Empire, an
event Avhich was at that time much feared by many English statesmen.
The late Lord Derby was a very eminent statesman. He was once Colonial Minister,
and, whilst in office, distinguished himself by the energy and justice with which he
maintained the rights of the Maoris, a branch of the Polynesian race. The present
Lord Derby now holds the same office as his father then held. I believe that he will be
equally careful of your rights.
On the 3rd of January last he telegraphed: “ Within the last few days the German
“ Government has given and received renewed assurances that the independence of these
“ islands (Samoa) shall be respected Her Majesty’s Government hope, therefore,
“ that the New Zealand Government will not preclude the internationalisation of these
“ islands, which is obviously the best measure at this juncture for British interests.”
Lord Derby does not say so, but I am sure he also felt that it was at this juncture
the best measure for Samoan interests that he could secure, and it certainly presents
great advantages for you.
We may now at any moment be engaged in a great war; in that case it might at this
time be difficult to afford you protection. If a war does break out, and you were left
unprotected, every vessel that entered your harbour would be a cause of apprehension to
you. Justly enough you might fear that it was a hostile cruiser, and that great trouble
might fall upon you.
If you are an independent nation, and a great war breaks out, every vessel of every
country that enters your harbour will be in security there, and will to some degree
increase your wealth and commerce. Such a war will bring more benefits than ills to
you. Samoa will gradually increase in importance and prosperity. Europeans and
natives resident in Samoa will alike feel that the best has been done tor them at the
present moment. If, from war breaking out, or any other cause, New Zealand and
Samoa cannot' now unite, there is nothing to prevent such a union taking place at'another
time.
< Your present want of importance will, if you remain independent, add to your safety,
whilst the limited extent of Samoa and its small population will render the task of
establishing and maintaining an efficient government one of small cost and of no
great difficulty.
Those good qualities in the Polynesian race which I have with so much pleasure
recounted, quality the Samoans to perform such a task. The undertaking would be
watched with interest, and all capable of aiding you would exert themselves to secure
your success. When this was attained you would have gained a great benefit for the
whole Polynesian race, and you would then, I am sure, exert y ourselves, as in former
days, to spread Christianity and civilization throughout the Pacific,
Let me venture to add a few words of advice to one whose letter and frankness touched
me, who is placed in a position of exceeding difficulty, and whom I sincerely desire to aid
and benefit.
Much of the future of your people depends on you. For their sake, you must dare,
bear, and suffer all things which your moral duty requires you to enter upon or endure.
Be in all things an open and sincere man. Never enter into secret negotiations or
arrangements. If any come to you with proposals to do this, refuse; say that the mere
fact of their coming in this guise is unfair to you, as it will inevitably cast suspicion on
your conduct, and involve you in difficulties which may even risk the loss of the
independence of Samoa.
If you act in this open manner, and at the same time give no just cause of complaint,
I do not think that any statesman, however powerful, would venture to commit the great
crime of seizing on or oppressing a weak and inoffensive nation such as Samoa is.
In this weakness, in this inoffensiveness, in your harbour, in the fertility of your soil
in the value of your position, your security consists. Mutual jealousies would make all
the great nations look with displeasure on any power that wrongfully seized Samoa, and,
if this act was a cruel and inexcusable breach of international law general indignation
would be excited in all civilized countries.


If such a crime is about to be committed, or if it has been committed, arid you are
seeking redresss, you had better rest your arguments against it on your natural rights, the
freedom of the Samoan people from any wrong or hostile act, the sinfulness of the
piratical act which is about to be committed, or which has been committed. , All good
men, learned or unlearned, can understand and feel these things, and sympathise with
you. Do not rely on legal arguments or European precedents; there would be no like-
ness between such cases and that of Samoa. Your case is a very simple one, easily
understood. Let it remain so. Embarrass it with nothing that may distract attention
from the cruel selfishness of the act.
I have written to you in the same spirit of friendly frankness with which you addressed
me. I will take care, when the question of Samoa comes -before the New Zealand
Parliament, as it shortly will do, that your interests are fairly represented.
If England does not sanction our union you may rest assured that New Zealand will
long with pleasure remember the offer made by yourself, your Government and Parlia-
ment, to be annexed to this country. Some day it may have an opportunity of repaying
an act which is the greatest proof that could be given of entire confidence.
If all goes well with yourself and the people of Samoa let me know, as one who will
rejoice to hear such good news; if Samoa is involved in any further difficulty, let me
know, as one who may be useful, and who will aid you to the best of his ability in all
right things,
I have, &c.
To Malietoa, King of Samoa. (Signed) . G. Grey.

expiration of their sentence, be kept in a House of Correction until attaining their
majority.
Art. 9. Convictions prior to the promulgation of the present Law shall be counted

28 May 1863. Counsel for the defence shall be appointed.
Art. 12. Relegation shall not take place until the expiry of the last sentence to be
undergone by the criminal. Nevertheless the Government may anticipate that
period in order to cause the transference of a relegue, or may compel him to undergo
the whole or part of his sentence in a penitentiary. Penitentiaries may be made
depots for liberds who may be maintained there until the next time of departure for
the place of their relegation.
Art. 13. A relegue may temporarily leave the territory of the relegation under

of possessing means of subsistence. Such petitions shall be made pursuant to
Executive regulation under Article 18.
Art. 17. The Government may accord to releguds the exercise, within the place
of relegation, of all or part of the civil rights of which they shall have been deprived
by their convictions.
Art. 18. Executive regulations shall appoint the conditions under which reldgues

subject to such surveillance the places in which they are interdicted from appearing
during the remainder of their sentences.

Memorandum for his Excellency The Governor.
Ministers have the honour to acknowledge receipt of Despatch of the 17tli February
last from the Right Hon. the Secretary of State for the Colonies, concerning the recent
proceedings of the German Consul at Samoa.
They would desire to point out that from information received from Samoa the
German flag is still hoisted at Apia, in contravention of the understanding arrived at
between Her Majesty’s Government and the Imperial Government of German}-, and this
though the action of the Consul is, as has been stated, disavowed by the German
authorities at Berlin. Indeed what the Government of France did at Raiatea has
practically been done by the Germans at Samoa. In the former case it was understood
the agreement between England and France would be preserved, and the unauthorised
action of the French Consul annulled, but the French flag still flies at Raiatea, and
negotiations regarding it have been pending for several years. At Samoa it would
almost appear that a similar state of things is to exist there.
Ministers would venture again to urge that if annexation is disapproved, the inter-
nationalization of Samoa will be strictly preserved.

Recruiting Polynesian Labourers in New Guinea and adjacent Islands.
Report of Royal Commission.
To his Excellency Sir Anthony Musgrave, Knight Commander of the Most Distinguished
Order of St. Michael and St. George, Governor and Commander-in-Chicf of the
Colony of Queensland and its Dependencies.
May it please your Excellency,
We, the Commissioners appointed under a Royal Commission, sealed with the
Great Seal of Her Majesty’s Colony of Queensland, on the 23rd day of December 1884,
and recorded in the Register of Patents the 31st day of that month, to inquire into the
circumstances under which divers Labourers, natives of New Guinea and of other Islands
in the Western Pacific Ocean, including the D'Entrecasteaux Islands and the Louisiade
Archipelago, who have been introduced into the Colony under the provisions of “the
“ Pacific Island Labourers Act of 1880,” have been engaged ; the manner in which the
nature of their engagements was explained to them ; and as to the understanding by the
said Labourers of the nature of their engagements, and the period for which they are
alleged to have agreed to remain and serve in the Colony; to visit such places in the
Colony where the said Labourers are employed, to examine the said Labourers, to take
down the examination of the several witnesses that might appear before us and reduce
the same into writing ; to transmit such examinations, together with a full and faithful
report of the facts concerning the engagements of each of the said Labourers, and of
such other matters concerning the premises as the Commission might think fit, to the Office
of the Honourable the Colonial Secretary of the Colony of Queensland, beg to transmit,
as directed, the evidence taken by us, together with a Report made by us thereon to
Your Excellency.
2. On the afternoon of the 6th January the Commission held its first meeting in
Townsville, and was duly constituted, Mr. Buckland being appointed Chairman.
3. The Labourers to be examined being employed on the Sugar Plantations situated
on the Johnstone, Herbert, and Pioneer Rivers, and on the Burdekin Delta, it was agreed
to visit these districts in the order named—first, because it had been suggested to us by
the Under Colonial Secretary that the best interpreters would be found in the Ingham
district; and, secondly, because of the imminence of the wet season, when travelling
becomes uncertain and difficult.
4. The Inspectors of Pacific Islanders accompanied the Commission in their respective
districts, and assisted, as far as in them lay, the Commission in prosecuting its inquiries.
5. In addition to the Labourers whom we discovered on the plantations capable of
acting as interpreters, we were materially assisted in our task by a native teacher named
Diene, and by Cago and Toiamina, lads who had been employed in the Supreme Court
as interpreters,
6. The proprietors and managers of the different plantations visited by the Commission
afforded every facility in conducting the examination of the Islanders.

f Note. —The Report only is printed in this paper, but copies of the Report, Minutes of Evidence, &c. have

7. The Commission held thirty meetings, at which evidence was taken. Four hundred
and eighty Labourers and two natives of the South Sea Islands (being portion of the
boat’s crew of the “ Hopeful ”) were examined, as were also the teacher Diene and Cago
the interpreter.
8. The inspectors of Pacific Islanders in the various districts visited were likewise
examined as to the methods adopted by them in finally explaining the nature and term
of their engagements to the Islanders, and passing them.
- 9. It would have been desirable, the Commission thought, to have examined the
Government agents on board the vessels which had recruited the Islanders, the subject
of inquiry ; but it was found that they had either left the colony or were out of reach,
The logs kept by the agents were, however, called for, and those available were read over
by us-
-10. The question which first presented itself to the Commission was as to the amount
or degree of credibility which ought to be given to the evidence of the Islanders. We
admit that this would have been a difficult matter to determine had the Commission been
satisfied with the examination of a select 'few on each plantation or from the passenger
list of each labour ship; or, as was even suggested on more than one occasion, of repre-
sentatives chosen, not by the Commission at random, but by the managers of the
plantations beforehand. The futility of the latter course was early demonstrated; and
as the terms of our Commission enabled us to call before us “ all or such of the labourers
“ as we should deem necessary,” we saw that the only safe and prudent course, if the real
truth respecting “ the facts of the engagements of each of the labourers ” were to be
obtained, was patiently to subject everyone of the natives to examination. The adoption
of this tedious procedure resulted in the prolongation of our inquiry beyond the period
we originally believed necessary, but we found our account in the satisfactory discharge
of a delicate duty and in the conviction forced home to our minds that we had secured
such a body of evidence and acquired such a knowledge of the Islanders as enabled us to
give an informed and impartial judgment.
11. In some quarters it is alleged that no credence ought to be given to any statement
made by the islanders of Polynesia. The argument is that an attribute of the savage or
semi-savage is unveracity, and that under no circumstances (much less in any case in
which his presumed interest lies) is his asseveration worthy of belief. It is not within
our province to rebut the general proposition that all savages, any more than that all men,
are liars ; but we repudiate with all the earnestness in our power the suggestion that the
truth is not to be found in the natives of the islands of the Western Pacific. The
impression conveyed to our minds after the examination of nearly 500 of these Islanders
is, that generally speaking they were anxious to tell the actual facts of the incidents on
which they were questioned, and that their story is to be accepted (with the exceptions
subsequently noted) substantially as it was given to us.
12. As a matter of course, we were mainly dependent in the fulfilment of our com-
mission upon the services of interpreters. Sometimes the evidence had to be filtered,
so to speak, through the medium of two interpreters. But as we gained experience
during the inquiry we also found many checks by which to test their reliability: such as
familiarity with the manner of the witnesses, the methods of the interpreters, and the
private use of vocabularies compiled from the witnesses themselves of their different
languages. Of the anxiety of Diene, Cago, Toiamina, and Gatin, to give exact trans-
lations of the statements of the labourers there could be no question ; and the only
instances in which suspicion was roused, and in at least one important case confirmed,
were those in which we were compelled to avail ourselves of interpreters offered to us for
the examination of " boys ”on the same plantation. In some such cases the idea was con-
veyed to our minds that a concocted story was being retailed; indeed, we had twice to
guard against signalling from “ boys ” outside to those within the room where the
examination was being conducted. These cases were, however, exceptional, easily
detected, and do not at all militate against our general conclusion, that the evidence as a
whole should be taken with little or no reservation.
13. In the gravest instances of wrong-doing on the part of the recruiting crews of the
labour ships, the corroboration of the main incidents was so striking and so strong as to
be irresistible. Where there was variation in the narrative of different witnesses of the
same events, it was no more than would occur in the evidence of the most intelligent
and most highly civilised white men, and a variation in minor details which must
necessarily arise from individual idiosyncrasies and the sharpness or otherwise of personal
observation.
14. Our inquiry divided itself naturally under three main heads —(1) The circum-
stances under which the Islanders were engaged; (2) the manner in which the nature of


the engagements were explained to them ; (8) the understanding by the recruits of tht/
nature of their engagements and the periods for which they had agreed to serve.
15. (I) Recruiting was conducted on all the voyages which were the subject of
investigation—(a) on shore; {b) in canoes which had either been taken to the fishing
grounds on the reefs or had been paddled out to reconnoitre the labour vessels ; and
{c) on board ship when the natives came to barter fruits for tobacco.
In order to secure labourers the principal device of the recruiting agent would seem to
have been an appeal to the cupidity of the savage. He displayed a tempting array of
tomahawks, knives, tobacco, and calico—in fact, those articles most coveted by the
inhabitants of the islands of the southern seas.
Presents of trade more or less liberal, and promises of other supplies, generally secured
a ready acquiescence to the proposal to go in the boat or ships.
The love of home of these Islanders amounts to a passion, and the recruiting agents
had to overcome dislike to practical exile by assurance that they would not be absent
for any length of time. Wherever there was pronounced unwillingness on the part of
natives to go in the boats or remain in the ships they were too often impressed by threats,
though cases of overt kidnapping were confined almost wholly to one voyage—viz., to
that of the “ Hopeful”—as was also the dastardly act of wrecking canoes and driving
the occupants into the water that they might be rescued by the ship’s boats.
16. (2) Even under the most favourable circumstances the natives had very little
conception of the real purpose for which they were invited on board or engaged to go in
the ship to Queensland.
That purpose ought to have been explained on three separate occasions—first, by the
recruiting agent through his interpreter, and that in the presence of the Government
agent who was bound to be in the covering boat, supposing the recruiting was being
conducted from the beach ; second, by the Government agent when on shipboard he
was entering the names of the recruits in his log; third, by the Polynesian Inspectors at
the port of arrival in the Colony.
At times no interpreter was carried in the recruiting agent’s boat, and then, no matter
how desirous he might be of dealing fairly with the natives in his negotiations for their
hire, he had to depend on signs, a most unsatisfactory method, however expressive the
pantomime may be; in fact, the more ingenious the gestures the more are they to
be misunderstood. A favourite device was to hold up two or three fingers, and to
imitate the cutting of cane and grass or the digging of yams. One agent with a sense of
humour took a yam and bit it three times. Nor could the simple intimation that they
were wanted “ to go and work in white man’s country ” convey more than a rudimentary
notion of continued labour to people who, when not fighting or fishing, spend their days
with their “heads in the shade and their feet in the sun.”
Many of the recruits were utterly astonished when they arrived on the plantations in
Queensland to find they had to perform the hard tasks involved in the cultivation of
sugar; and as matter of fact they are for many months useless as labourers, and must be
gradually broken in even to the simplest field-work.
But, with or without the assistance of interpreters, the recruiting agents appear at best
to have discharged their duty, in explaining the nature of their engagements to the
would-be recruits, in the most perfunctory manner.
The Government agents seldom seem to have “ informed themselves by personal
“ observation and inquiry that the intending recruits understood the nature of their engage-
“ ments.” In truth, the regulation that the labourers should be recruited in the presence
of the Government agent was more honoured in the breach than in the observance. One
Government agent at least was too frequently under the influence of liquor. So far as
we could discover when the recruits were brought on board ship, the Government agents
sometimes tied a piece of calico round their necks, sometimes they entered their names
in the official logs ; very rarely indeed did they take any trouble to learn whether the
recruits really appreciated that they had entered into an engagement or the purpose of
it. When the Government agents did execute their duty in this respect, they had to
avail themselves of the services of the interpreters who had engaged the “ boys ”on
shore, or in canoes, or on deck, and of course that was little check on the recruiting
agent. We, however, are convinced that no man of ordinary penetration need be
deceived by interpreters to the extent shown to have been the case in some of the
proceedings which were the subject of inquiry.
There can be no doubt that many of the evils which the evidence taken by us discloses
have arisen from the utter inefficiency or incapacity of the Government agents. Had
Y 3


these been men of character, courage, and firmness of purpose—the outcome of a high
sense of their important and responsible dutj^—illegal recruiting, kidnapping, wilful
imposition on the Islanders, would have been hardly possible.
More care was exercised by the Polynesian inspectors at the ports of arrival in Queens-
land, although, as the result has proved, the means taken by them to ascertain whether
the natives had a “proper understanding of the conditions of their agreements, and that
“ they voluntarily entered into the same,” were utterly inadequate. Why this should
be so will be more fully referred to later on.
17. (3) In discussing the third head of our inquiry, viz., the understanding by the
labourers themselves of the nature of their engagements, and the period for which
they agreed to remain and serve in the Colony, we must revert to the question of
interpreters.
Much of the success of a labour cruise depends on the recruiting agent and the inter-
preters employed by him. There would seem to have been looseness in the engagement
of interpreters ; and although we only obtained little direct evidence of it, there is ample
reason to believe that in many cases the interpreters, who in fact too often were
unscrupulous and uncontrolled recruiting agents, were rewarded according to, or promised
compensation corresponding with, the number of recruits obtained. This vicious principle
must be credited with many of the evils it becomes our duty to expose.
18. For the most part Teste Island boys were employed as interpreters ; though
previous to the regulation dated 18th April, 1884, under “ the Pacific Island Labourers
Act of 1880 ” which made it compulsory to “ carry interpreters on arrival in Queensland,”
some vessels had manifestly no interpreters on board at all.
19. The interpreters seldom appear to have taken any pains to really explain to the
Islanders that they were wanted to go to Queensland to work on a sugar plantation for
three years. Either of their own initiative, from a desire to earn reward according to
success, or as instructed by the recruiting agents, they invited the Islanders to go and
“ work on the ship ”; to “ sail about ” ; to “to go to white man’s country to walk
about”; “to go and see white man’s island” ; “to go and fish on the reef for beche-
de-mcr ”; “to go to Queensland to work ” ; comparatively rarely “to go and work
sugar.” And the periods of time during which the interpreters said the recruits were
to be absent from their islands were quite as diverse, ranging from one night up to three
“ borimas,” which latter might mean in the estimation of the Islanders, according to
local interpretation, any term varying from three moons up to thirty-nine moons, as will
be more fully explained in a subsequent paragraph.
20. The value of the regulation we have quoted in paragraph No. 18 is minimised by
the fact that it provides no real check upon unscrupulous agents or interpreters. If the
same interpreters who have engaged the natives at their islands are employed as the
intermediaries between the Polynesian inspector in the Colony and the recruits, these
interpreters naturally repeat to the recruits the story at the port of debarkation which
they had told them at their islands. And where this was not done we found that they
gave a false and grotesquely inadequate rendering of the terms of the engagements read
over to them by the inspecting officer. In this manner, instead of being of service and a
safeguard to inspector and recruits, the interpreters coolly deceived both. The inspector
at Townsville seems to have taken for granted that if the recruits held up three fingers
when the interpreters spoke to them, they understood they were engaged for three
years. As matter of fact, in too many instances the three fingers were held up because
the recruits had been previously schooled so to do, or as indicative of a belief that they
were about to work on a plantation for three moons.
21. Admitting that at the port of arrival, as the result of anxious and careful methods
adopted by the inspectors, the recruits had explained to them that they were engaged to
work for three years, that was of little avail in checking injustice—firstly, because the
recruits were too often plainly afraid to do anything but assent; secondly, because even
if not possessed by fear of the officer they had been taught to call “ big Government
master,” they did not understand that they could repudiate then and there an engage-
ment for three years when they had come for, say, three moons, granting the former
not to their liking. They seemed to have accepted whatever the “ big Government
master ” said as the inevitable, and their only resource was to “go below and cry.”
Thirdly, because for the most part the natives of islands having little communication
with white men—and such were almost wholly the subject of our inquiry—cannot grasp
in their untutored minds so long a period as three years. They have very imperfect and
limited notions of time future.


22. The idea seems to have been present to more than one inspector that if he used
the word “ yam ” the Islanders would understand it at once. This is a mistake. “ Yam ”
is a West Indian word imported into the English language, and could possibly have no
meaning to, say, the natives of New Guinea or Piron, who had never come in contact
with Englishmen. The vast majority of the labourers examined never heard of the
word “ yam ” before they came to Queensland, and it must have had quite as much
meaning to their darkened understandings as “ aeon ” would have had. The edible
tuberous root which we call “ yam ” has a different name in nearly every island, and qua
root does not suggest a period of time. For instance, in Basilaki or Moresby Island it
is called “ yoi-i-da ” ; in Duou or Normanby, “ kinari” ; in Ferguson Island, “ bebie” ;
at Port Moresby, “ mahu ” ; in Sud-Est, “ wi-i-we ” ; in Pig Island, “ dahe ” ; in Teste
Island, “ quatea ” ; and at Milne Bay, “ wai-i-da.” There is, however, a period of time
or season known to the Islanders, and it has some relation to the growth of the tuber
“yarn.” The space of time embraced from the preparation of the ground for planting
the “ yam ” till the ripe tuber is dug up and stored is designated by a name which also
means the feast held at the ingathering of the crop—a primitive harvest home. That
feast or space of time is called in Basilaki, “ hia” ; in Duou, “ mamaserai ” ; in Joannet,
“ boi boima”; in Sud-Est, “ dbga-dfega ”; in Renard, “mananati”; and at Teste
Island, Ferguson Island, Milne Bay (New Guinea), and Pig Island, “ borima.” But
the season described generally by these various words in the different islands is indeter-
minate in length, according to the time taken to mature the tuber or to the duration of
the feast. No dependence can accordingly be placed on the use of the word “ yam,” or
its equivalent as an edible root, or of the words employed for season or feast, as con-
veying to the minds of natives from numerous and widely separate islands a fixed term
which they would at once understand as a period of service. The employment of the
word “ yam ” at the port of arrival, in explaining a three years’ engagement, was,
therefore, altogether illusory.
23. The signing of the agreements by the recruits on board ship immediately before
being sent to the plantations has, in our opinion, an unreal air of legality and formality.
In the first place, we doubt whether in all cases the utmost pains were taken by the
inspectors, even with the assistance of interpreters, to thoroughly explain the nature of
the engagements to the recruits. This is subject to the remark made use of by the
inspectors at Townsville, and of the Ingham District, which we in some measure though
not altogether endorse, that the inspectors are at the mercy of the interpreters, i.e., that
they must depend upon the interpreters faithfully translating what is said to them by
the inspectors as to the terms and conditions of the engagements, and also on their
assurance that the recruits are able to understand their speech. In the second place,
the recruits seemed to have marched past the inspector and touched the penholder which
was held to the agreement schedules, because they were ordered to do so by the recruit-
ing agents, by the captain of the ship, by the inspector, or by the interpreters. “ All
“ boys did it; therefore we did it,” was frequently the comment of the witnesses when
questioned on the subject. In the third place, because the recruits had a very faint
notion indeed of what was meant by a written agreement. The inspector at Mackay
admitted that he did not think it worth his while to see that each boy touched the pen,
because he did not believe they in the least understood the meaning of attaching their
signatures to the document. It must be said, however, that a number of “ boys ”
appeared to have grasped the conception that by touching the pen they had committed
themselves to something, they did not exactly know what, but which might have some
undefined influence in detaining them longer on the plantations than they had originally
bargained for. And, as a rule, these “ boys ” stoutly denied having “ touched ” or
“ kissed ” the pen.
24. In a letter from the Under Colonial Secretary accompanying the Royal Com-
mission, we were informed that the Islanders whose introduction into Queensland would
form the subject of inquiry had all arrived during the past year by the ships “ Ceara,”
“Lizzie,” “Hopeful,” “Forest King,” “Heath,” and “ Sybil.”
25. This was found to be the case, and we propose to give an outline of the methods
of recruiting pursued on board each ship, so far as disclosed by the* evidence. This
outline will embrace the circumstances under which the natives were induced to go on
board ship, the manner in which their engagements, when any were entered into, were
explained to them, and their interpretation of the period of hired service.
Y 4


Voyaok No. 1 —“ Csara ” sailed from Brisbane 3lst December 1883, and arrived at
Townsville 17 th February 1884, with 107 recruits on board.
The “ Ceara ” evidently sailed straight from Moreton Bay to the Louisiade Archi-
pelago, where she arrived on the 14th January, on which date recruiting was begun at
Piron Island. It is to be remembered that the regulation providing for the ship carrying
interpreters was not in force at this date; and a commencement seems to have been
made with recruiting without the intervention or assistance of interpreters.
During an inquiry into alleged kidnapping by the “Ceara,” held at Townsville by
Mr. E. Morey, Police Magistrate, of that town (copies of the report of which inquiry
were furnished to the Commission), it was stated by Capt. Inman, Mr. J. Burrowes,
Government agent, and by Mr. John Johnson, recruiting agent, that many of the natives
spoke pigeon English, and that when these had been recruited they acted as interpreters
for the rest. A boy named “ Tackamulla ” appeared from our investigation to have
been employed as an interpreter, or, more properly speaking, as an agent to induce his
fellow-islanders to goon board the “ Ceara.” But we found that even after twelve
months’ residence in Queensland “ Tackamulla’s ” pigeon English was incomprehensible,
and in our examination of him we had to use interpreters. That no competent inter-
preters had been used was also evident from the answers made by many of the boys to
our question as to why they had gone on board the “ Ceara.” Instead of replying in
their own language they invariably repeated, in broken English, “ cut sugar.” If this
be not the explanation, then the only alternative is that they had been taught “ cut
sugar ”as part of a lesson which they were repeating. We are inclined to adopt the
latter theory, for the weight of evidence points to the fact that few or none of the boys
heard of or appreciated being engaged to work on a sugar plantation until some time
after, when a Kassewai boy named Waibili came on board, acted as interpreter, and went
through the pantomime with the recruiting agent of cutting a sugar-cane. The Piron
islanders apparently knew something of beche-de-mer fishing, for they almost invariably
asked the recruiting agent, when the boats went ashore from the “ Ceara,” if he had
come to look out “beche-de-mer.” Whereupon the answer given was “No; he look
out boys.” The recruiting agent made a display of tomahawks, knives, and calico,
and other trade, made signs to the islanders to come into the boat and they would get
these; and promised occasionally that if they would go to white man’s country they
would be given guns, boxes, &c. One witness very characteristically said that the
“ recruiting agent had not spoken to him ” but that “ the tomahawk had talked to him.”
Some of the islanders do not appear to have been altogether sure of the friendliness of
their visitors, for the women all ran away into the bush, and even the men were very shy
of approaching the boat.
When engaged or induced to go on board ship by the presents of trade, a period of
engagement was very seldom mentioned. The recruiting agent occasionally held up his
fingers, but that was interpreted as meaning “ moons,” or even “ sleeps,” i.e., nights.
It was stated by Captain Inman, at the inquiry held in Townsville before police
magistrate Morey, that he had been informed at Piron Island by the natives that “ a big
“ fellow vessel had been shooting at them, and taken plenty boys.”' None of the Piron
islanders whom we examined had seen or heard of such shooting or kidnapping by any
vessel which had previously visited their island.
The same methods of recruiting appear to have been adopted at Sud-Est Island and
at Kossel Island. It was not till 60 boys had been recruited, and the ship was at
Kassewai, a small island near Pig Island, that the boy Waibili was recruited and
employed as an interpreter. In our judgment the pantomime of cutting a sugar-cane was
not gone through until Waibili came on board. Those already recruited were evidently
then shown the pantomime of cutting a sugar-cane and told they were to work so.
Waibili told them various periods, ranging from one moon up to three “ borimas ”or
“ d6ga-d6gas,” the latter being the term used in Sud-Est for the season embraced
between the planting of the yam and the feast which attends the ingathering of that
tuber. The only boy who really admitted that he had been informed he was to
work three years, added that when “Jack” (the recruiting agent) and Waibili said
three years, he did not want to go, but that Jack fired a rifle and frightened him.
At Joannet, Pig, and Flat Islands, the Renard and Redlick Groups, and St. Aignan’s
Island, Waibili acted as interpreter. When he mentioned a period, which was not often,
he fixed the absence from their islands of the recruits at one, two, three, or four moons,
apparently as seemed to accord with what he perceived to be the wishes of the islanders.


On the voyage to Queensland the recruiting agent told the recruits he was “ a very
“ good fellow : good to the boys,” and that “ when big-fellow master came up and said,
“ ‘You stop three years,’ they were to say ‘all right.’ ”
At Townsville, which was reached on the 17th February, Waibili was brought into
requisition as interpreter between the Polynesian Inspector of the district, and the
recruits. Here some of the boys heard the word “ yam ” for the first time ; but Waibili,
as a rule, described to them fairly enough that they were to work on a sugar plantation
three “ borimas ” or three “ dega-d6gas,” about the nearest equivalents to “ year ” that
natives of the eastern portion of New Guinea and of the Louisiade Archipelago under-
stand or appreciate.
The boys, on hearing this, were in most cases disappointed, and went below and cried.
There was a fear on the part of Waibili that this would be observed by the inspector, for
he counselled them to cease crying, otherwise the “ master would hear them ” ; while he
defended himself against the charge of deceit by alleging that it was the “ Government
master ” who had fixed the period of work on the plantation at three “ dhga-dhgas,” and
not himself.
Our opinion is that all the recruits brought by the “ (Jeara ” on this voyage were
seduced on board on false pretences; that the nature of their engagements was never
fully explained to them ; that they had little or no comprehension of the kind of work
they had to perform; and that the period for which they agreed to come was in no
single instance three years.
Voyage No. 2.—“ Lizzie” sailed from, Townsville 22nd December 1883, and arrived at
Townsville Y]th February 1884, with 126 recruits.
The Lizzie ” left Cleveland Bay on 22nd December 1883 and arrived at Teste
Island on the Ist January 1884, where native boats’ crews were engaged. On the Ith
the ship was off Mewstone Island, and a commencement was made with recruiting.
Here a number of boys who had come off to the ship in canoes, to exchange cocoa-nuts
and other fruits for tobacco, were induced to remain on board for the purpose of going
to the “island belonging to the white man” for periods varying from one to three
moons, generally the latter. They were promised, in addition to the “ trade ” which was
then given them, guns, boxes, tomahawks, &c. At the Redlick Group more boj's were
enticed under similar pretences, and on the Qth, while off Warry Island, nine recruits
jumped overboard and attempted to swim ashore. The boats were lowered and five
recaptured. At this date the regulation prohibiting the forcible reapprehension of
escapees was not in force.
After working the Redlick Group the “ Lizzie” went on to Joannet, the natives of
which did not understand the Teste interpreters or boatmen. Canoes were paddled out
to the ship, and the islanders wished to trade fruits for tobacco. They were ordered to
come on board in some instances under threats of being shot. Some married or old men
were afterwards permitted to go ashore, but all the young men were detained, being
told they were to go and work in Queensland for two or three moons. Two days after-
wards Grass Island was visited, and here boys named Dixon, Sandfly, and Beheea were
engaged, and afterwards seemingly employed as interpreters and recruiting agents.
Sandfly and Dixon were old beche-de-mer fishers, and had acquired a certain knowledge
of pigeon English. Sandfly admitted that he had been promised by the Captain U.
when the ship reached Townsville if he would secure “ plenty boys.” Dixon, however,
seemed to have had most to do with procuring boys, and explaining to them why they
were wanted to go on board the “Lizzie ” and proceed to Queensland. We shall recur
to these boys in the sequel.
At Grass Island and Joannet, which were revisited, boys were recruited by holding
up three fingers, and told they were to “go work ” ; others, who had come out in
canoes to trade for tobacco, were, as soon as they came close to the vessel, ordered on
board on pain of being shot; some again, who had agreed to go for three moons and
had learned on board that they were to be away from their island longer than three
moons, were put under hatches, and threatened that if they attempted to swim ashore
they would be shot. Between 16th January and 10th February the ship cruised between
Sud-Est, Piron, Brierley, Garden, Joannet, and Grass Islands, and picked up there over
80 recruits. At neither of these islands did the natives understand the Teste language,
u 16272. 2


so that .the Wari or Teste boatmen were useless as interpreters. On one occasion we
found that the Wari boys had made , use of their fingers, and pointed to the sky tc
indicate a period of time ! The recruiting agent (who throughout this voyage appeared
to be known to the islanders as the “boatswain”) apparently was most prominent in
communicating with the recruits; When the ship’s boats went ashore the natives at
times ran away into the bush evidently afraid, but were coaxed to return by a display of
trade. The women, however, never came out of the shelter of the bush. Where the
natives displayed less timidity they brought food down to the boats, but were assured by
the “ boatswain ” that he did not wish “ kai-kai ” but wanted to “ buy boys,” and
accordingly he offered trade to sucli boys as would agree to go on board ship. One
native declared he did not want to go when told he would have to work in sugar, but
that the boatswain took him by the wrist and pulled him into the boat. Some were
invited to go to Queensland to “walk about,” or simply to go on the ship, or to see
their countrymen that were on board the vessel. A few irresolute ones were told not
to be frightened, but to “come on deck and get things”; a number were recruited to
work in sugar cane for one, two, or three moons. Canoes took out fish and fruit to the
ship to barter for tobacco. The natives were detained and put down below, and told if
they attempted to swim ashore they would be shot. Where old men or very young
boys formed part of the canoe crew these were permitted to return to their island, but
the young men were retained on board. On one occasion a canoe went out to the
“ Lizzie,” but when the occupants saw a boat being lowered they pulled for the shore.
The white men in the boat then waved handkerchiefs and cried, “ You no run away ;
“ plenty of your countrymen on board ; verygood you come”; and when they went on
board they were induced to go in the ship for two moons. At Sud-Est a number of
natives had been fishing and returned on shore, where they camped. While asleep a
boat from the “ Lizzie ” came ashore; the white men took the natives by the wrist,
ordered them to the boat, and conveyed them on board ship, where they were confined
in the hold till the “ Lizzie ” had gone out to sea.
Although some of the statements made would seem to indicate that the labourers had
occasionally been told in the neighbourhood of their islands, immediately after being
recruited, “ that they were to go and work sugar in white man’s country for three yams,”
yet the impression left on our minds was that they only heard of “ three yams ” when
the “Lizzie ’’ was fairly on her way to Queensland.
An almost invariable remark of the recruits during examination w’as that had they
been told “ three yams along a-their island they would have run away ” or “ not have
come.” There is evidence to show that during the voyage they were schooled in view
of the approaching interview with the Polynesian inspector at the port of debarkation.
They were instructed that when they came to Townsville and “ the big Government
“ master came on board they were to hold up three fingers.” At Townsville, Dixon,
Sandfly, and Beheea were apparently employed as interpreters between the recruits and
Polynesian inspector. One witness said, “ Dixcn altogether talk; no fellow talk; Dixon
no good.” Some told the interpreters to inform the Government inspector that they
had only come for three moons, and not for three yams; but their request was not
complied with. They were prompted to place their marks on the agreements by the
“ boatswain.” A few even did not comprehend that they were either to work at all or to
remain for three years till they reached the plantation, when they learned it from con-
versation amongst the boys at night in the huts. So firmly convinced were a few that
they had been engaged for only three moons that at the expiry of that period they
packed up their bundles and were about to leave the plantation when they were stopped
by the overseer.
The whole of the reemits brought by the “ Lizzie” during this voyage are employed
at Hamleigh plantation. When the Commission visited Hamleigh the manager, Mr. A.
S. Cowley, suggested that we should only examine two or three of the boysf who could
talk very good English, as fair representatives of the remainder. This the Commission
consented to do, reserving their judgment as to their future course of procedure.
The first boy presented was Dixon, who had quite a pat story that he had been
recruited to “ work sugar in Queensland for three yams.”
During the examination of the next two witnesses there was such evident signalling
between Sandfly, who was outside the room, and an overseer and the witnesses, that the
room was ordered to be cleared by the Commission. Dixon, Sandfly, and Beheea were
employed as inteipreters in the examination of a few subsequent boys, but it was evident
from manner and speech that a prepared story was being told. These were the only
cases in which the witnesses declared that they had been recruited at their islands for


three yams. At the close of our examination of the Hamleigh labourers, which lasted a
week, Dixon and Sandfly appeared and withdrew their former statements, which had
been made under fear of Mr. Cowley, and said that they had been recruited for only
three moons.
While any declaration made by either of these boys is to be received with caution, yet
we arc convinced, as the result of our examination of all the other recruits on the
plantation, that in the case of the five boys who deponed that they had been engaged
for three yams, such story was the result of deliberate preparatory schooling. We are
confirmed in this from our assurance, after careful inquiry, that “ yam ” is a term
unknown in the Louisiade Archipelago, or, indeed, in the Western Pacific, in the neigh-
bourhood of New Guinea. “ Yam” has no more meaning, as indicative of a period of
time, to the natives of these islands, than it would have to an Esquimaux.
We are of opinion, therefore, that not one of the labourers brought by the “Lizzie”
on this voyage agreed, when recruited, to serve and remain in Queensland for three
years ; that the nature of their engagements was never clearly explained to or understood
by them, and that the method of recruiting was cruelly deceptive and altogether illegal.
Voyage No. 3. —“ Ceara” sailed from Townsville 13 th March 1884, and arrived at
Townsville 28th April 1884, with 137 recruits.
Leaving Cleveland Bay on 13th March last year, the “ Ceara ” reached Teste Island
on the 30th of same month. Interpreters were not secured, however, until the sth
April, when sail was made for Bentley Island, and that afternoon a dozen natives were
recruited from canoes and on shore. At the very outset the Teste interpreters appear
to have adopted the plan of inducing the islanders to recruit on the plea that they were
to be employed in the fishery. Throughout the voyage this was the
almost invariable story, and its success was perhaps due to the fact (doubtless known to
the Teste interpreters) that at several of the islands visited, notably Bentley, Moresby,
and Tarrahvara, beche-de-mer fishery was familiar to the natives, many of them having
been employed by a Chinaman named Ah Sim or Ah Gim and by a Captain Miller.
Indeed, at Karaura Ah Sim had had a “ smoke house ” for the purpose of curing the
b6che-de-mer, The very first recruit was taken in the boat against his will and “ put
below,” where he was warned not to attempt to escape, and a sentry with a snider placed
at the companion way. When there was any reluctance on the part of the natives to
engage to go beche-de-mer fishing the Teste interpreters declared that they were
“ missionary boys and were not gammoning,” statements which generally had the effect
of lulling suspicion.
In one instance the “ Ceara ” was believed to be a missionary schooner, and the
natives the more readily went on board. Various periods were spoken of as terms of
engagement, ranging from two nights up to ten moons, though in two cases we were
informed that the time had been put at two and three seasons or “ borimas.” At
Moresby Island especially the term “ borima ” seems to be an elastic period of time, it
being understood by some to extend to only one moon, and by others from three up to
13 moons, while a few did not know how many moons were in a “borima.” The
interpreters evidently fixed the terms at random, as seemed agreeable to the natives.
Occasionally, as at Moresby Island, where the greatest number of recruits were obtained,
the story was varied by the interpreters, the “ boys ” being asked to go on board the
ship to “ sail about,” or to be conveyed to the white man’s country and work.
The actual recruiting lasted only some ten days, and the methods already described
were practised at Tubi-Tubi, Nuakata, and Tarrahvara, after exhausting Mores oy. It
is to be noted that while the very unanimity of the boys in stating that they had been
engaged to work as beche-de-mer fishers imported an element of suspicion into their
evidence, that doubt disappeared when we found the story substantially corroborated by
labourers on quite different plantations, where there was no opportunity of collusive
agreement. When the recruits were taken on board the schooner they were evidently
interviewed by the Government agent through the interpreters, ,but in few instances was
“ going to work on a sugar plantation ” explained to them until the “ Ceara ” was fairly
on the return voyage to Queensland, or, as the witnesses graphically said, “in deep
water.” Then they began to talk among themselves about having been “ gammoned ”
by the Wari boys, and cried. Nearly all of them said that had they been told at their
island that they were to be taken to cut sugar they would not have consented to go on
noard ship.
Z 2


On arrival at Townsville the Polynesian inspector came out to the “ Ceara ” and
explained to the Teste interpreters the terms of the engagements and the nature of the
work, but the interpreters, while as a rule informing the recruits that thej’ were to
proceed to a plantation to work in cane-brake, gave different periods, varying from one
moon up to two “ boriraas.” Some were told that if they “ worked quick ” they would be
finished in three moons ; others to wait on the plantation until they (i.e,, the interpreters)
came to take them back to their islands. The latter complained that they had been
waiting and waiting but that neither the captain nor Wari boys had yet come to take
them home ; and one pathetically said that a white man, every moon, told him, “ when
the next moon came up he would go back.” Many of the recruits were anxious to
inform the Polynesian inspector that they had not come to Queensland to work on a
sugar plantation, but as beche-de-mer fishers, but the interpreters would not explain this
to the “ Government master.” The interpreters occasionally laid the blame of the boys
being sent to the plantation on the shoulders of the inspector. That the idea of working
on a sugar plantation had never occurred to many of the recruits was well explained by
one witness. He told the interpreter that he did not know how to work sugar; where-
upon the interpreter said that he would only have to work “ a little bit ” in the forenoon.
r !'he recruit added that when he got to the plantation he found “ plenty work ”—con-
firmation strong of the statement made to us by the Polynesian Inspector at Mackay
that recent arrivals from “strange islands” had come to Queensland with “very im-
perfect notions of the nature of the work required from them.” This misunderstanding
as to work and the interpreters’ deceit as to the period of service led to two cases of
gross hardship. A boy named Warum-wo-reahre, who had been engaged as a beche-de-
mer fisher and was subsequently informed that he was to “ work sugar ” for two moons,
ran away from the plantation on the Lower Burdekin at the expiry of the two moons.
He had then discovered that he was not to be taken back at the end of the period under-
stood by him. Six other boys from the same island (Tubi-Tubi) accompanied him.
They took possession of a boat which they found in one of the creeks in the Burdekin
delta, and sailed for the South Seas. They actually reached the neighbourhood of
Cooktown, where they were picked up by a pilot schooner and returned to the planta-
tion. Within a week they endeavoured a second time to escape, but were captured near
Cape Bowling Green. Warum-wo-reahre was sentenced to and suffered three months’
imprisonment for running away from his “ hired service,” and another boy, Wer-waycc,
endured a week’s imprisonment for the same offence.
Our opinion is that a system of deliberate fraud was practised in engaging all (he
recruits during this voyage; that their engagements were not explained to them in any
sense approximately correct; and that none of them believed they had agreed to remain
and serve in Queensland for three years.
Voyage No. 4. — “ Lizzie” sailed from Townsville 14 th March 1884, and arrived at
Townsville 2nd June 1884, with 67 recruits.
Owing to the non-production of the Government agent’s log for this voyage it w« s
somewhat difficult to follow it in chronological order; but after leaving Cleveland Bay
on the 14th March 1884 Teste Island seems to have been made, interpreters engaged,
and a course steered for Moresby Island where recruiting began. Here the usual
incidents occurred. Natives went out to the ship taking fruits with which to barter
tobacco. Sometimes they were asked to engage themselves to go “ look out ” beche-
de-mer fishery, with which industry they appear to have been practically acquainted.
Anon they were invited to “ come on deck and have a smoke,” and were kept until there
was no chance of escape to their islands. Again, some were simply inveigled on board
by a display of tomahawks, knives, and calico, and prevailed to remain mainly on the
strength of the assurance that they were going to be employed as beche-de-mer fishers.
Various periods were mentioned, varying from one to six moons, and it was not till they
had got into “ deep water ” that they were informed they were to be taken to Queens-
land to “ work sugar.” One “ borima ” was occasionally mentioned as the term for
which they were to “ work sugar ” —a period generally recognised in Moresby Island as
five moons. As described by more than one of the witnesses, a “borima” consists of
five moons —one moon in which they dig the ground and plant the yam, the second
moon they clean and weed, the third moon the plant grows up, the fourth moon the leaf
dies, and the fifth moon the tubers are dug up and eaten. It may be well to state here
that ten of the Moresby Island recruits, allotted to Mourilyan Plantation, on the John


stone River, effected their escape from Queensland. They made tracks through the
bush to the mouth of the Johnstone River, seized a Chinaman’s boat and sailed north-
wards. They reached Murray Island, whence they were conveyed to Port Moresby and
afterwards returned to their islands by H.M.S. The escapees were examined
at Port Moresby by Commodore Erskine, and a copy of his report was furnished to
us. There is a remarkable similarity in the evidence obtained by Commodore Erskine
and that furnished to us by the boys who remained on the plantation, Kitai was visited
by the “ Lizzie ” after Moresby, and then Duou or Normanby Island and Little Woodlark.
At these places it would seem the natives were simply attracted on board ship by the
gifts of “ trade ” and the promise of more. Although three of the witnesses declared
they had been told from the first they would have to work in Queensland on a sugar
plantation for three yams or years, we received their statements with much reserve, the
impression from their manner being that they were retailing a prepared lesson.
At Townsville, when the Polynesian Inspector came on board, the Teste Island inter-
preters appeared to have frankly told all the recruits that they were to work on sugar
plantations ; but they varied the period of service form two moons upwards, seemingly
on no consistent plan. There can be no that the majority of the labourers, on hearing
they were to work on a sugar plantation and for an extended period, wept bitterly.
On a review of the whole evidence as to recruiting on this voyage of the “ Lizzie ” we
are of opinion that while some of the natives were forcibly kidnapped, all of them were
allured on board by false statements; that the nature of the engagements to which they
subsequently attached their marks was deliberately misrepresented to them ; and that they
had no clear understanding they were coming to Queensland to work on a sugar planta-
tion for three years.
Voyage No. 5. — “ Hopeful” sailed from Townsville 3rd May 1884 arrived at
Dungeness Y]th July 1884, with 123 recruits.
The “ Hopeful” sailed from Townsville on 3rd May 1884, and arrived on the 11th
at Teste Island, where, on the following day, boats’ crews and an interpreter, Alec, were
engaged. On the 13th the ship was headed for Moresby Island, at which place recruit-
ing was begun by the boatswain Williams, who, however, did not offer the usual presents
of trade. McNeil, the recruiting agent, subsequently went ashore for the purpose of
giving the trade to the friends of the recruits. The natives declare that they did not
want to go but were dragged into the boat, and when brought on board the ship were
put below. They did not understand Alec, except that he said something about two
moons. On the 14th a move was made to Basilisk Island, where several recruits were
obtained for two moons, and the ship then went on to Killerton Island. Diene, a coloured
missionary teacher, came off from his station, which is situated on that island, to the
“ Hopeful ” to inquire the object of its appearance in those waters. Captain Shaw
began by saying that he wanted some of Diene’s boys to go and work on the sugar
plantations of Queensland. Diene promised to speak to the natives of Burra Burra, and
did so, telling them they were wanted for a three years’ engagement. All the boys,
however, were afraid to go, and then the captain besought Diene to furnish him with an
interpreter. Diene recommended Cago, one of his boys, who agreed to go to Waga
Waga, a village situated in Discovery Bay, at the head of Milne Bay. The captain
informed Cago that if he got “ plenty boys ” he give him “ anything belonging to
white man down at Townsville.”
Cago, before taking leave of Diene, promised to report to him if the “ captain stole
any boys.” On the 15th the “ Hopeful ” was at Waga Waga, and Eponisa, a coloured
missionary teacher who belonged to Samarai or Dinner Island, but who had gore to
Waga Waga on a visit, went on board the ship. He was taken down into the cabin by
the captain, who had a private interview with him, and with Inuka, another teacher, who
had meantime come out to the “ Hopeful.” The influence of those two teachers secured
a large number of recruits, who, however, were all told that they were only going to the
white man’s country for two moons. One native, on being informed by Cago that he
would be absent from his home three borimas, wanted to run away; but Eponisa
threatened that if he did he would be shot. Meanwhile, some natives who had heard
what was going on proceeded to Killerton Island and reported the matter to Diene, who
accused Eponisa, on the return of the “ Hopeful ” to Killerton, of taking the boys
Z 3


against their will. Eponisa on the other hand, retorted that such reports were lies, and
that when the boys saw the “ trade ” they wanted to engage. Between the 17th and
19th the “Hopeful” boats visited Barra Burra and Aioma, where Eponisa induced
several natives to go on board by the display of tomahawks, tobacco, and calico, and by
telling them they would be back in two moons. Eponisa was landed at Burra Burra,
and the ship went down to an island called Bau, where Cago was employed as interpreter;
but he failed to get any natives to engage when he told them they were to go to white
man’s country for three boriraas. The same happened at Lilahuta and Duou, which
drew from McNeil the reproach against Cago that he was “ too lazy to bring boys ”
and that he had been telling the natives they would be away from their homes three
years instead of moons. Cago was likewise told that in future Alec would be taken
as interpreter. About the 24th Wararai was visited, and here numerous canoes came
out to the ship, and 30 recruits were taken on board. Some declare that they wished
t o buy tobacco, and that in stretching up the side of the ship from their canoes to obtain
the tobacco in exchange for their fruits, they were dragged on board by McNiel or Alec
against their will, and told they were going to work for two or three moons. Erom
Wararai the “ Hopeful ” proceeded to Bentley Bay on the mainland. McNeil went
ashore with Alec. An old man and small boy were told they might remain, but a
woman and several young men were, under threats of being shot, ordered by McNeil or
dragged by Preston into the boat. This woman, who had been wounded in the struggle,
afterwards escaped by swimming ashore at Teste Island. Both boats subsequently
returned to the shore, the people ran into the bush, and McNeil set fire to their houses.
Kaiaha was reached on the 26th ; two trips were made to the beach, and eight recruits
engaged for one, two, or three moons.
From this place the ship went, on the 27th, to Taputa, where Cago was again made
use of as interpreter, but no recruits obtained. Next day Alec went in the boat with
McNeil, and seven recruits were procured, Alec telling them they would come back in
two moons. When they were brought on board, Cago was commanded not to talk to
them, otherwise they would swim ashore. The “ Hopeful ” then stood over to Ferguson
Island or Hilliwow. Several canoes came out to trade with the ship. Two boats were
owered. In the first was McNiel (coxswain), Preston, Harry, Jack, and Alec; and in
the second, Barney Williams at the helm, Rogers, Charley, and two Teste Island boys.
When the boats were lowered the canoes were turned shorewards, upon whicli chase
was given, McNeil directing his attention to one containing eight natives, and Williams
to another with six or seven in it. McNeil was unable to overtake that which he was
pursuing, and he stood up in his boat and fired at the canoe. The native who was
steering was struck at the back of the neck; the bullet came out at his throat, and
striking the man next to him on the right shoulder, the latter fell overboard and sank.
The steersman fell in the canoe, dead. All the other occupants of the canoe leapt into
the water, the canoe was overtaken, caught hold of by Jack and cut with a tomahawk
by McNeil, who then directed his crew to pick up the natives who were swimming
about in the water. Four were so rescued, and to prevent escape, placed beneath the
thwarts of the boat, while tAvo were believed to have reached the shore by swimming.
In the meantime Williams had been encouraging his crew to pull smartly so as to
catch up with the canoe containing the six or seA r en natives. The latter made for a
reef which had only a foot or two of water on it, but before reaching it the canoe was
cut by Williams, and the natives, as usual, took to the sea. A rifle was fired and one
Islander shot; five and a small boy were picked up by the boat. One of the rescued
islanders jumped overboard from the boat, whereupon Williams followed him with a
large knife in his hand. As the Islander was coming up on the reef Williams cut the
poor wretch’s throat, and he sank into deep water. The boat was then pulled up to the
icef, from which Williams leapt into it. The two boats then joined company, and the
little boy being of no use as a recruit, was cast adrift on two coco-nuts, which Avere tied
together and placed under his arms. The little fellow was seen to slip from the coco-
nuts and was drowned in the surf. The canoe cut by McNeil had not sunk. It con-
tained the body of the steersman. Williams cut the head off, and the mutilated remains
Avere thrown overboard. There Avere noAV four natives in each boat, placed under the
tlnvarts to prevent escape, and in this fashion they Avere brought to the “ Hopeful,”
from Avhich the shots fired had been heard and the smoke of the rifles seen. Williams,
it Avas also observed, changed his trousers as soon as he came on board, and hung those
he had taken off in the rigging. As the “ Hopeful ” AA’as bearing away from Hillwow a
Avoman in a canoe paddled out to the ship and cried after it, but no heed was given to
her. The eight natives thus “ recruited ” Avere not permitted to go on deck for two


days. Though a digression, it may here be stated that when brought to Queensland
and sent to Victoria Plantation, on the Herbert River, they effected their escape,
wandered about in the bush for two months, made their way northwards, and were at
last found at the mouth of the Johnstone River, whence they were reconveyed to
Ingham.
To return to the cruise of the “ Hopeful,” however, she was off and on the coast ot
Duou or Normanby Island during the first three days of June. On the third the boats
went ashore at the mouth of a river. On the opposite side from that at which the boats
landed a numerous company of natives assembled. Alec (the interpreter) called out to
them, but they were too scared to approach. McNeil then ordered the “ trade box ”
to be brought ashore and left on the beach, while the boats were to be pulled some
distance out from the land. The natives ran away into the bush, and were followed by
McNeil, Williams, Preston, and Rogers. Rifle shots were heard, and McNeil and his
men shortly returned to the shore and hailed the boats. When afterwards putting out
to the ship in the boats Preston declared he had killed two men, and Williams owned
to having shot a boy. That night, while the “Hopeful” was standing along the coast
of Duou, two Wararai boys escaped from the ship. On the succeeding morning Cago
and Alec were sent on shore in a boat to search for the escapees, but the natives declared
that they had not seen them. McNeil afterwards landed, and through Alec, said that if the
Wararai boys were not returned he would fight. By-and-by, a large canoe put out from
a bay farther along the coast. Alec and Cago were despatched to see whether the
occupants had seen anything of the Wararai boys, but when they saw the boat approach-
ing they returned to land and ran into the bush. McNeil came up and landed and fired
two houses near the beach. The natives rushed out of the bush upon the boat’s crew,
and threw spears and stones. The boat’s crew responded with rifle fire, by which two
natives were killed. McNeil was speared in the thigh; Preston cut on the head with
a stone, Jack on the Temple, and Harry in the shoulder. When the boats returned to
the ship, Captain Shaw asked McNeil what had been the meaning of all the firing, to
which McNeil replied that there had been a fight, but that they had seen nothing of the
runaways.
The “ Hopeful ” then stood on towards Cape Pierson, in Duou, to a place called
Kasi-Kasi. Here natives came in canoes to barter fruit for tobacco, but in reaching up
to obtain the “ trade ” pretended to be offered to them they were pulled on board and
told they were to go and work in white man’s country for one or two moons. Divo was
next visited, and several natives were induced to go in the boats by presents of “ trade ”
and by holding up three fingers.
About the 10th June, Harris Island or Sanaroa was reached—and here the murders
for which McNeil and Williams were tried before the Supreme Court, at Brisbane, were
enacted—and eight natives kidnapped.
From Harris Island the “ Hopeful ” sailed to a small island called Iwai, close to
Woodlark, where five recruits were obtained. Some “ trade ” seems to have been given
them. One said he had been told by Alec he would be brought back in two moons ;
of the others it was impossible to make much, although by their gestures they appeared
anxious to indicate that they had been dragged on board the boats or the ship by the
hair or by the wrists. The captain and the Government agent, Schofield, were in the
boats which landed on this island.
On the following morning the vessel went on to Ketawai Island, where a canoe came
off with a crew of ten men, one of whom was induced to go on board by signs from the
captain and a present of “ trade.”
About the 18th the “Hopeful” was at the Island of Coiawata. Late in the after-
noon a canoe containing five natives came out from the island, but did not approach
close to the ship. McNeil ordered a boat to be lowered, which was manned by himself,
Schofield, Preston, Rogers, Alec, Harry, and Jack. The “ trade ” box was not taken.
The boat pulled after the canoe, which was caught hold of by Jack at the order of
McNeil, who then told Alec to ask the natives if they would come on board. They
shook their'heads and said they did not want to go. McNeil thereupon cut the canoe
with a tomahawk, and the natives jumped into the water. Four of the five were picked
up, but it was too dark to discover the fifth. To prevent them escaping the natives
were put underneath the thwarts of the boat, which was then pulled in the direction of
the ship ; and it was only after signal shots had been fired and lights had been shown
from the “ Hopeful ” that the ship was reached. That night the mate (Freeman)
ordered Cago and Alec to sleep below with the recruits, and give warning of any
attempt on the part of the boys to escape, while a sentry was placed on deck armed with
a snider,
Z 4


Next morning, the ship having stood off and on all night, a canoe put out from Gowa
close to Coiawata, and made inquiries regarding the canoe that had gone out the previous
night and had not returned. Alec, instructed by the captain, told the natives that they
had not seen the canoe. Both McNeil and Williams’ boats were then lowered, and
chase given to the canoe, which contained four natives. Alec having, at the bidding of
the captain, shouted to the occupants to stop and come to the ship, which they refused
to do, McNeil cut the canoe and it sank. Three of the boys were picked up. One,
who was evidently a very strong swimmer, would have escaped but for a Duou boy in
Williams’ boat, who dived after him, caught him and brought him to the side of his boat,
into which he was pulled.
From Gowa a course was laid to Sanoba, where two boats went ashore—one to cut
wood and the other to look out for recruits. A boy who was fishing on a reef was
kidnapped. Normanby or Duou Island was revisited towards the last days of June.
Here Alec was told by McNeil that he wanted plenty of boys, that he was to say
“moon,” and that the “captain would by-and-by pay him.” Alec induced several
natives to proceed on board the “ Hopeful ” by saying that they were going to Teste
Island; others he told would go to white man’s country for two or three moons. By
this time there were at least ]49 male recruits and one female on board, and the
“ Hopeful ” bore away for Teste Island, which was reached on the 30th June. During
the run the captain called before him Alec, another Teste boy named Naupa, and Cago,
and said that they were to tell all the recruits to come and sign the paper (agreements),
that they were going to Queensland, and that when they arrived at Queensland a
“ big-fellow Government master” would come on board and talk; that they were to say
“no ” when big Government master asked them if he (the captain) had stolen the boys;
that they were “to look out for him,” i.e., were to speak in his favour; and that he
would “ bring them back to their islands.” Then the captain told the interpreter to
instruct the recruits to hold up three fingers, which was done.
When the “ Hopeful” arrived at Teste Island 28 of the recruits, including the one
female on board, escaped by swimming ashore, a distance of about two miles.
On 2nd July the “Hopeful” was boarded by the boarding officers of H.M.S.
“ Swinger,” who overhauled the Government agent’s log and the captain’s ; and next
day the “ Hopeful ” sailed for Queensland. Alec and Naupa meantime deserted from
the ship. In the course of the voyage to Queensland Cago, the remaining interpreter,
was again schooled as to what he was to say to the Polynesian inspector on arrival in the
Colony. He was to declare that there had been no kidnapping, no shooting, and that
all the boys had come willingly to work in Queensland for three years.
Dungeness was reached on the 17th July. Captain Pcnnefather, the Polynesian
inspector for the Herbert River and Johnstone River districts, evidently took great pains
to make the boys understand the agreements. He had the assurance of the interpreter
—who, however, was clearly intimidated by the captain when he said it—that he had
explained to the recruits that they were to work on a sugar plantation for three “yams,”
and that they had all agreed to come of their own freewill. Captain Pcnnefather, as an
additional precaution, cut 36 notches on a stick, and told Cago to explain to the recruits
that each notch represented a moon, and that 36 moons was the period they would have
to work. Many of the boys, however, declare that they never saw the stick; others
that they were shown it, but did not understand what it meant; a few believed that it
indicated they were to be away from their islands a long time; while none of them com-
prehended that they were to be employed on a sugar plantation for three years.
The history of this cruise of the “ Hopeful,” of which the foregoing is an outline
drawn from the evidence submitted to us, is one long record of deceit, cruel treachery,
deliberate kidnapping, and cold-blooded murder. The number of human beings whose
lives were sacrificed during the “ recruiting ” can never be accurately known. In
addition to the two men killed at Sanaroa, for which the recruiting agent, McNeil, and
Williams (boatswain), were tried before and condemned by the Supreme Court, and in
regard to which cases it is needless for us here to enlarge further than to say that the
stories narrated to us more than confirmed the facts brought out at the public trial;
there is in our estimation abundant evidence of the commission of many other murders.
The inhuman slaughter of the natives of Hiliwow was amply corroborated by six or
seven witnesses. Anything more heartrending we have never heard or seen than the
tale by the father, Togaiwina, of the drowning of his little boy, or the horror depicted
in Waneipa’s eyes and on his face as he described the doing to an atrocious death of the
boy on the reef; There are some little discrepancies as to the names of the boys who


were killed in a particular manner, but the identification of persons must have been
almost impossible when the witnesses themselves were diving and swimming in a broken
sea and trying to escape. All, however, were at one as to the facts of the shooting and
throat-cutting. The very variation in minor details, at any rate, proves that they were
not retailing a previously arranged story. The main incidents were also testified to by
the boatmen Jack and Charley. It is true that in their first examination they denied
having seen any such tragedy. It was, however, evident from their demeanour that they
were endeavouring to conceal a guilty knowledge, and we were not at all surprised
when they afterwards came back and wished to make a clean breast of it all. Further,
neither Charley nor Jack could have had any intercourse with the Hiliwow witnesses,
for the former could not talk the language of the latter, and the latter could not speak
English,
As we had made arrangements to keep Charley and Jack apart from each other, and
also that all the boys who had been examined should be kept separate from those not
yet called before us, there was no conceivable room for collusion. The interpreters were
likewise not permitted to hold communication with the witnesses before or after they
were examined. But there is this other point to be noticed, that while Jack, in his first
deposition, did not mention the drowning of the child Quai-i-du, and denied the firing
of any rifles, Charley referred in his first statement to Quai-i-du swimming shoreward,
and to the rifles having been fired.
Although there is no corroboration of the account given by Jack of the burning of
houses at Bentley Bay, on the mainland of New Guinea, or at Duou, nor of the shooting
of the natives at the latter place, we have no reason to disbelieve the story.
The first part of the voyage was disgraced by the hypocritical behaviour of the
coloured teacher Eponisa—seduced, no doubt, by promises of reward from the captain;
and all through “ Alec,” the Teste interpreter, was a too ready and unscrupulous tool
of McNeil’s. Cago’s chief peccability was in his weak submission to the captain’s
intimidation and in bis prevarication, alike to the Polynesian inspector at Dungeness and
to the recruits.
We are of opinion that none of the recruits on board the “ Hopeful ” were lawfully
recruited, and that not one understood he had engaged to remain and serve in the Colony
for three years.
Voyage No. 6. —“ Sybil ” sailed from Mackay 22 nd April 1884, and arrived at Machay
6th October 1884, with 48 recruits.
The “ Sybil ” sailed from the Pioneer River on 22nd April 1884, and shaped a course
for the Solomon Group, with 67 male and 11 female return Islanders. A perusal of the
Government agent’s log shows that almost from the date of sailing the master and most
of the crew were more frequently intoxicated than sober. When the “ Sybil ’ was 84
days out from port, and the majority of the return Islanders were either dead, had
escaped, or been landed, the ship was at Port Mary, Santa Anna.
Here a native named Oliver Cromwell was engaged as interpreter “at 61. per month
“ as long as the ship is recruiting, and a bonus if he shapes well,” a contract contrary
to the provisions of “ The Pacific Island Labourers Act Amendment Act,” dated 10th
March, 1884, which sets forth that “no person shall pay or give or agree to pay or give
“ to the master of any ship employed in carrying passengers from the Pacific Islands to
“ Queensland, or any other person employed thereon, any sum of money or other
“ valuable consideration the amount whereof is dependent either in whole or in part upon
“ the number of passengers conveyed to Queensland : But the remuneration of the
“ master of every such ship and of every other person employed thereon, shall be at a
“ fixed rate, either for the voyage, or dependent wholly upon the time occupied in the
“ voyage.”
Down to IQtfr July nine recruits had been obtained at Santa Maria, Malo, Torres,
and the Solomons, but, as the engagements of natives from these islands are without the
scope of our Commission, they were not inquired into nor need be further referred to.
At the date last mentioned the “ Sybil ” was lying at Maroo Bay, in San Christoval, one
of the Solomon Group, and was about to proceed to the Louisiade Archipelago. The
Government agent, Mr. C. J. Browne, wrot e an official letter to the master, in which he
said “ Previous to sailing from Mackay, Mr. Macdonald, Inspector of Polynesians,
u 16272. A a


c< instructed me that, should the ship engage recruits at any of the outlying islands of
** New Island, New Britain, &c., or indeed anywhere save at the New Hebrides, Banks,
“ Torres, and Solomon Islands, he would exact that an interpreter—able to satisfy him,
“as Inspector—accompany the recruits to Queensland. I, therefore, take it that the
“ Louisiade Group will be considered as outlying New Guinea I hold it
“ my duty to protest against any engagement of recruits unless you are prepared to
“ comply with the conditions imposed by the Immigration Department through Mr.
“ Macdonald.”
Notwithstanding this protest, attempts were made to obtain recruits, without the
intervention of an interpreter, at Rossel, Piron, Sud-Est, Pig, and Grass Islands, but
without result. At Grass Island the Government agent reported that the natives were
very shy on account of some of their people having been kidnapped by another vessel.
The “Lizzie” recruited at this island some time in January.
On the Qth August the “ Sybil ” came to Duou (Normanby Island) in the D’Entre-
casteaux Group, and recruiting here was successful, though the Government agent makes
the following entry in his log : “ Recruits from this out were only provisionally engaged.”
According to his own admission the natives could not speak English; it was impossible
for him therefore “to inform himself that they understood the nature and term of their
engagements,” and in permitting recruiting at all he clearly violated the 14th section of
the Regulations under “ The Pacific Island Labourers Act,” and clause 13 of the instruc-
tions to Government agents. From the 9th to the 15th August six natives were
recruited, mainly by making signs and showing tomahawks. On the 17th four jumped
overboard and tried to swim ashore, but “the boats soon recovered them,”, a proceeding
contrary to Regulation 20, which provides that “no attempt is to be made to re-take
unwilling islanders,” it may be noted that of those four re-captured recruits one died in
Queensland, two absconded from the plantation on the Pioneer River and have not since
been discovered, and the only one remaining says he had been coaxed on board by the
promise of tomahawks and knives and told he would come back in two moons. Twelve
more natives were recruited in Duou between the 17th and 20th August, mainly by
holding up three fingers and giving them “ trade,” though one declares he was pulled on
board and put below, where he was kept until the ship left Duou.
Goulvain Island was reached on the 21st, and here Gowarup and Togumagum
were, with two other natives, recruited. The Government agent logs that as these
two boys “ speak and understand English,” the Inspector of Polynesians at Mackay
“ will be thoroughly satisfied about the recruitment of their fellow countrymen.” We,
however, found that they could not understand a word of English ; and while one says
he was told “ three boriraas,” he did not know how many moons that meant, the other
declares that the white man who bought his fruits held up three fingers and showed him
the moon.
Elsewhere along the coast of Goulvain the recruiting was conducted by showing yams
and making three bites; by showing the moon and clamping of hands twice ; by cutting
a sugar-cane three times ; or by imitating the digging of the ground three times.
Recruiting was stopped on 23rd August, and Mackay was reached on 6th October.
The Polynesian Inspector at Mackay boarded the “ Sybil,” and having read the
Government agent’s log, made the following entry in it:—“ Have read this log, which
“is a record of drunkenness and incapacity on,part of the master, and consequent
“ insubordination of the crew.”
He (the Inspector) made use of Gowarup and Togumagum as interpreters, and held
up three fingers and spoke of Yams. But few of the recruits appreciated the meaning
of it all, and the inspection appears to us to have been very perfunctory and unsatis-
factory. ,It ought to be noted that of the thirty-seven recruits brought by the “ Sybil ’ ’
from the Louisiades and the D’Entrecasteaux Group, no fewer than ten absconded from
the plantation and had not been found at the date of our visit to the Mackay district,
and six have died.
We are of opinion that the attempts made to explain the nature of the engagements
to the recruits, both at their islands and at the port of arrival, were wholly inadequate ;
that the engagements were not fully understood by the recruits, and that none of
them appreciated that the term of service for which they had left their homes was three
years.


Voyage No. 7. —“ Forest King” left Brisbane 17th May 1884, and arrived at Brisbane
31s£ October 1884, with 21 recruits.
The “Forest King” left Brisbane on the 17th May, and reached Rossel Island
in the Louisiade Archipelago, on the 27th, where an attempt was made to recruit
without an interpreter. The Government agent, Mr. J. Thompson, however, wrote
an official letter to the captain, prohibiting recruiting without interpreters. The ship
then made for Sub-Est and Brierly Island, and at the latter place a native named Kasowai
was engaged as interpreter. From 2nd June till 10th June Sud-Est was exploited for
recruits and 16 secured, Kasowai, however, telling them that they were to go on the
ship as beche-de-mer fishers ; to go and see white man’s place, not to work. Generally,
he said they would be away two moons, but sometimes he varied the term to “no long
time.” On the 10th Kasowai and a recruit deserted the ship, and four days later the
Government agent again served notice on the captain that he would not permit recruiting
without an interpreter. The “ Forest King ” then returned to Brierley Island, where a
lad named Moses, in the employment of Nicholas Minister, a beche-de-mer fisher, was
engaged as interpreter. Moses would appear to have spoken to the recruits already on
the ship, but those who remember him say that he gammoned them, or that he told them
they were to be away two moons. Moses deserted before any fresh recruits were hired,
and the “Forest King” went to Teste Island, where three natives were engaged as
interpreters, viz., Charley, Harry, and Archer. Charley evidently attempted to interview
the recruits on board; but as he did not speak Sud-Est, and only two of the recruits knew
a little Teste, nothing came of the communication. On 24th June the ship visited
Bentley, Watts, and Skelton Islands, where Charley asked the natives to go to “ white
man’s place ” for two moons. Moresby Island was next recruited, and Charley and
Harry induced seven natives to go on board to “ sail about,” “to go to dim-dim’s
country ” for two moons. The same story was repeated at Duou (Normanby) and
Ferguson Islands, which were “ worked ” from 30th June to 4th July, and seven recruits
obtained. On 6th July the “ Forest King ” crossed over to the mainland of New Guinea.
Charley and the other interpreters were unable to speak the language ; but by the display
of trade, and holding up two fingers and saying “ oma hia,” which is “ moon,” three
natives were decoyed on board. The “ Forest King ” was at Anchor Island on Qth July, and
here H.M.S. “ Swinger ” appeared on the scene. The boarding officers of the “ Swinger,”
Rev. Mr. Macfarlane, Mr. H. M. Milman, and the interpreter Jerry, went on board the
“ Forest King.” Charley and Jerry both spoke to the Sub-Est boys, but neither could
make themselves understood. Two Sub-Est recruits who spoke a little Teste said that
Charley spoke Teste, but that they “no hear him good.” With the other recruits from
the other islands both Charley and Jerry could converse, and they all said that they told
both that they bad been engaged for two moons. Upon that Jerry informed some of
them that they would have to “ work, work, work ” in white man’s country, that they
did not understand how to work, and that they would get sick and die. This frightened
many, and that night 22 of them slipped overboard and attemped to escape, which some of
them did. On the afternoon previous, Lieutenant-Commander Marx, of the “ Swinger,”
had seized the “ Forest King ” for a breach of “ The Pacific Island Labourers Act,” and
put a man in charge. A prize crew was placed on board on the 10th, and she was taken
to Brisbane, where she arrived 31st October.
During the voyage to Brisbane Charley seems to have acquired some knowledge of
Sud-Est, for the boys say that while he could not talk to them at their island he was able
to tell them at Brisbane that they were to work three boriraas on a sugar plantation.
To many of the boys, however, he said they were to go to a small island to “ cut stones
for two moons.” Pending the decision of the “ Forest King seizure case ”in the Supreme
Court, the recruits were apparently sent to some island in Moreton Bay, where they were
employed in breaking stones, and it was after the return from this island to the depdt at
Brisbane that Charley at last informed the recruits that they were to work for three
borimas “in sugar.” While the recruits were detained in tlie depot Charley spoke to
Tocy, a Sud-Est boy; told him he would by and by go to Court House, and that when
“ big fellow master ” asked him how long he had been engaged for at his island he was
to say “ three borimas,” and not “ two moons.” Tocy also declared he had been taken
to the court, but was not examined by the “ big fellow master.”
We are of opinion that all the recruits brought by the “Forest King” were decoyed
on board under false pretences; that the nature of their engagements was never explained
to them ; and that none of them understood they were to work on a sugar plantation for
any period, much less for three years.

Voyage No. 8. —“ Heath ” left Mackay 19 th July 1884, and arrived at Townsville
25th November 1884, with 19 recruits.
The “Heath” left Mackay on 19th July 1884, with 94 return islanders on board—
-63 males and 31 females ; and on 3rd August was at Kaan Island, near New Ireland,
where the passengers began to be landed. All the “ returns ” had been put ashore at
their homes by 7th August, when a course was laid to the Louisiade Archipelago.
Sud-Est was reached on sth September, and recruiting began with the assistance of three
Teste island boys who had come as passengers, and who had acted as interpreters for the
“ Ceara ” during the cruise which ended 28th April. No recruits were obtained, however,
at Sud-Est, and the “ Heath” sailed for the Marshall Bennett group, where she arrived
on 14th September, between which date and the 20th only two boys were engaged.
Those declared they had been asked to go to “ white man’s place ” for two moons. On
the 20th the boats were sent ashore at Duou, but the natives, according to the Govern-
ment agent, were veiy excited and began to throw stones, whereupon one of the boatmen
fired a rifle and a native fell. During the succeeding six weeks various parts of the
coasts of Duou and the neighbouring islands were visited and eighteen natives were
recruited by one or other of the interpreters, who informed them that they were to go to
“ dim-dim’s ” place for two moons, or for one borima, the latter being variously inter-
preted as from one to five moons. At one village Sam (one of the Teste Island inter-
preters) prevailed on a native to go on board on the strength that he belonged to
“ Jerry ” the missionary teacher, and that he would give him a “ box, tomahawk, knife,
everything.”
From 2nd November till the Bth only one recruit was got, and on the 13th two
escaped. The “ Heath ” then sailed for Teste Island, where the return interpreters were
landed and others could not be procured. Sail was then made for Queensland, and
Townsville was reached on 29th November.
The Polynesian inspector at Townsville refused to pass the recruits, as there were no
interpreters on board. Two boys were brought by the shipowners from a plantation on
the Herbert River—first, Sandfly or Kroos on Bth December, but he could not make
himself intelligible to the recruits; and second, Kimadama on loth December. Despite
the use of those two interpreters none of the recruits seemed to grasp that they were
engaged for three years; most of them said they were told one borima, which they
thought was one of two moons. During their enforced stay at Townsville while waiting
for the interpreters three were sent to the hospital ill. After being passed by the
inspector sixteen were removed to the Pioneer plantation, but on the night succeeding
the day of their arrival all absconded. One was drowned crossing a creek, two died in
the bush, the others turned up at the depot at Townsville, where they were kept for
some time. On 13th February eleven escaped from the depot, seized a boat in Ross’s
Creek and put out to sea, but were pursued by the Customs launch. Seeing this they
ran the boat ashore near Cape Cleveland and went into the bush. Trackers were
employed to discover their whereabouts, but a few days after they again voluntarily
returned to the dep6t at Townsville, and were afterwards again taken to the Pioneer
plantation on the Lower Burdekin.
Our opinion is that the recruits brought by the “ Heath ” were enticed on board under
false pretences, that the nature of their engagements was never satisfactorily explained to
them, and that none of them comprehended they were coming to Queensland to work on
a sugar plantation for three years.
26. In presenting to your Excellency the results of our prolonged and anxious inves-
tigations we venture respectfully to express the hope that we have faithfully discharged
the honourable and onerous duty committed to us.
We have the honour to be,
Your Excellency’s most obedient servants,

EARL OF DERBY, K.G. (Received July 6, 1885.)
Government House, Brisbane,
My Lord, May 20, 1885.
Referring to your Lordship’s circular telegram to the Governors of the
Australasian Colonies of the 19th February,* and to the Memorandum - ) - from General
Scratchley which has no doubt been already communicated to your Lordship by him, but
of which I inclose a copy for ready reference, I now enclose a copy of a
addressed to me by the Colonial Secretary and leader of the Government, expressing the
views of this Government upon the proposals submitted for their consideration touching
the arrangements contemplated in respect of the Protectorate of New Guinea.
2. 1 have officially communicated Mr. Griffith’s reply to General Scratchley, who has
recently visited this Colony at my invitation as my guest, but has now returned to
Sydney. I was of opinion that some personal communication between himself and my
advisers might produce satisfactory results, and I am glad that his visit to Brisbane has
led to an intelligible arrangement with this Government at least.
I have, &c.

THE EARL OF DERBY, K.G. (Received July 6, 1885.)
My Lord, Melbourne, May 28, 1885.
In my Despatch of this date,§ I refer to the illness of Deputy Commissioner
Rorailly, who was compelled to leave Port Moresby for Cooktown, where he arrived
on the 19th instant.
2. In reporting his arrival Mr. Romilly offered to return to New Guinea if I deemed
it necessary, although he had been advised by the surgeon of H.M.S. “Raven” at
Cooktown to apply for sick leave. This leave 1 have granted without fixing its duration,
and I fear he will be unable to return to duty before August.
3. At present he remains at Brisbane, where he can assist in the arrangements for the
return of the native labourers to New Guinea. He will shortly afterwards proceed south
in order to confer with me before my departure for New Guinea.
I have, &c.

In my Despatch of this date,§ I report that I have appointed Mr. Anthony
Musgrave, junior, at present Private Secretary to the Governor of Queensland, to be
an Assistant Deputy Commissioner for the New Guinea Protectorate.
2. I have foreseen for some time that I could not properly conduct the business of

3. I now ask your Lordship to sanction the permanent employment of Mr. Musgrave
at a salary of 700/, per annum. He is 35 years of age, and has had a varied official
experience extending over 15 years. He is thoroughly acquainted with the details of
the administration of a Colony, and, judging from his antecedents, I consider him well
suited to my requirements.
I also understand that he has been noted at the Colonial Office for employment.
4. Mr. Musgrave will be junior to Mr, Romilly, and on the completion of the duty
entrusted to him in connexion with the return of the native labourers, he will join me at
Port Moresby.
I shall then employ him on duties of inspection along the coast pending the receipt of
your Lordship’s decision as to his permanent employment.

THE EARL OF DERBY, K.G. (Received July 6, 1885.)
Mv Lord, Melbourne, May 28, 1885.
Deputy Commissioner Romilly has informed me that, before leaving Port Moresby,
it was reported to him that a settlement had been formed at the north side of East
Cape. The native teacher at that place had written to say that men, cattle, and horses
had been landed from a two-masted steamer supposed to be German.
The bush had been cleared, cocoa-nuts cut down, and the natives driven from their
villages.
2. Mr. Romilly adds that there is no reason to doubt the truth of the report. He
thinks the steamer may be the “ Samoa ” owned by Dr. Finsch, the German agent,
who some time ago was believed to be employed in reporting on the situation to his
Government. He was known to have purchased some horses and cattle at Cooktown
before proceeding to New Guinea.
3. Mr. Romilly is of the opinion that if the party was landed from the “ Samoa,” Dr.
Finsch may probably not have been aware that the British flag had been hoisted as far
north as Cape King William.
4. I will proceed to East Cape as soon as possible after my arrival in New Guinea,
and I trust that, by that time, I shall be possessed of authority to deal with the matter,
should I find that the party which has been landed is of German nationality. Mean-
while I will endeavour to obtain a confirmation of the report by sending a schooner from
Port Moresby.

Enclosure in No. 136.
’ Colonial Secretary’s Office, Brisbane,
Sir, ■ May 18, 1885.
I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt from your Excellency of General
Scratchley’s Despatch of 11th April, fonvarding for the consideration of this Government
a Memorandum upon the subject of the estimated cost of governing the British territory
in New Guinea.
2. Lord Derby’s telegram of 19th February to the Governors of the Australasian
Colonies expresses a hope that the Colonial Governments will without delay confer with
General Scratchley, consider with him what extent of territory inland should be annexed,
and form an estimate of the probable annual cost, stating how they propose to distribute
it and permanently secure their contributions ; and adds that all these matters should be
settled before General Scratchley goes to New Guinea, ‘as the final declaration of
sovereignty must be deferred until these arrangements are matured.
3. I have already in my letter of 18th February 1885, informed your Excellency of the
views of this Government as to the question of the cost of the maintenance of British
jurisdiction in New Guinea, and have in my letter of 2nd April, conveyed their wishes as to
the extent of territory inland to be annexed. These wishes were, of course, expressed with
reference to the circumstances as then known in this Colony. Since that time, however,
further information has been procured from a perusal of the Blue Book (C. —4273, 1885),
laid before the Imperial Parliament, and the White Book laid before the Reichstag, from
which it is, I fear, to be inferred that the time has passed when any expression of opinion
on the part of the Australasian Governments on the latter point is of very material
consequence. - '
4. Attention was called in my letter of 18th February (following a telegram which I
had the honour to ask your Excellency to send to Lord Derby on the same subject) to
the deficiency of information on the question of the extent of the powers intended to be
conferred on and exercised by the High Commissioner. On this point, however, the
Australasian Governments are, up to the present time, without further information.
5. Upon carefully considering General Scratchley’s commission and instructions, and
the Despatch of 17th November 1884, to Sir G, W. Des Voeux, High Commissioner of the
Western Pacific, it becomes apparent that the Special Commissioner for New Guinea has
hitherto had no legislative powers conferred upon him and only such administrative or
executive powers as may be exercised by a deputy commissioner under the Western
Pacific Orders in Council.
6. I have adverted to these matters because in the absence of any definite information
as to the functions intended to be performed by General Scratchley it is difficult to
know what expenditure need be incurred in performing them. I am aware that it is
intended that he should reside in or near to New Guinea, and I assume that he will
exercise, at any rate, some legislative authority, and some judicial authority by himself
or his officers, and that he will have to maintain a force adequate to preserve order in
such parts of the British territory as may be actually occupied. This Government has
accordingly endeavoured to consider the question of expenditure from this point of
view, and with such information as is in their possession. I have had the advantage
also of personally conferring with General Scratchley on the subject.
7. I entirely agree that whatever may be the ultimate decision of Her Majesty’s
Government as to the mode of occupation and form of Government of New Guinea, it is
necessary for the High Commissioner, by personal examination, to make himself
acquainted as far as possible with the requirements of the territory. I agree also that
the Government, whatever its ultimate form, must be organised on a tentative basis.
8. So much being conceded, I think that the proposed annual expenditure as suggested
in Schedules B. and C. of General Scratchley’s memorandum is fair and reasonable;
except that the cost of manning and maintenance of a steamer for the first year may
possibly be reduced below the sum of 17,000/. mentioned by him, and there may,
perhaps, in consequence of the delay that has occurred, be more than 8,000/. available
out of the contributions from the Colonies for the year ending Ist June next.
A a 4


9, I agree also that the High Commissioner will require a steamer of not less size than
that suggested by him, and probably a schooner and boats in addition. It will also, I
anticipate, be found necessary to erect suitable buildings for the residence of himself and
his staff on shore at Port Moresby or such other place as may be selected for his head-
quarters. Ido not think that the annual contribution of 15,000/. from the Australasian
Colonies will be sufficient to defray the capital expenditure for these purposes, which
must therefore be provided for in some other way. This Government will be prepared
to recommend to Parliament an appropriation to cover their share, in proportion of popu-
lation, of a loan of 20,000/. for that purpose—if Her Majesty’s Government, upon full
consideration of the matter, think that the whole of the amount should be advanced by
the Colonies—or of such less sum as may be required after allowing for any contribution
which may be made by the Imperial Treasury.
10. In effect, therefore, this Government accepts and adopts General Scratchley’s
suggestions, subject to such variations of detail as to the mode of expenditure as may be
found necessary after actual experience.
11. Your Excellency is aware that the share of Queensland of the annual contribution
of 15,000/. originally asked for by Her Majesty’s Government is provided for by a per-
manent Appropriation Act. The Government are not prepared under existing
circumstances to recommend to Parliament that the amount should be increased.
12. I have to request your Excellency to inform General Scratchley that this Govern-
ment will willingly place at his disposal the service of their officers for the purpose of
auditing the accounts of his Government, or rendering such other assistance to him as may
be required and may be consistent with their other duties. In particular, the Govern-
ment Resident at Thursday Island might, it is conceived, render some assistance as
a deputy commissioner, as was formerly done by Mr. Chester, Police Magistrate at that
settlement.
13. As soon as it is definitely decided what form of jurisdiction is to be exercised in
New Guinea, and over what extent of territory, this Government will be prepared to
consider any proposition that may be made for an increase of contribution towards
the expenses of the Government of New Guinea. In the meantime, however, they feel
that they are not in a position to deal with this question.

THE EARL OF DERBY, K.G. (Received July 6, 1885.)
My Lord, Melbourne, May 28, 1885.
During my recent visit to Brisbane 1 discussed with Mr. Griffith the question
of my powers as Her Majesty’s Special Commissioner for New Guinea, and at my
request he prepared an opinion of which I enclose copies, Mr. Griffith gave me this
opinion as a lawyer and not as Premier.
2. In my Despatch of the Bth instant,* I urged upon your Lordship the importance
of conferring upon me judicial and other powers to enable me to maintain control over
foreigners as well as British subjects in New Guinea.
3. The number of applications for permission to fell timber, to trade with the natives,
to explore and prospect the country is increasing, and I have already granted several
permits.
4. I am, moreover, informed that there are several persons waiting at Thursday Island
for the first opportunity to cross over to the coast of New Guinea. I have also discovered
by mere accident that one trader has removed without any permit a considerable quantity
of timber from the Gulf of Papua. The man has since applied to me for the permission,
which I have granted.
5. Again, at the present moment, the two white men, Guise and Curry, who were
deported by Deputy Commissioner Romilly (as reported in my Despatch of the 10th
March),! have succeeded in returning to New Guinea in defiance of my prohibition.

6. I am aware that under the Western Pacific Orders in Council, I can proceed
against these men, whose presence in New Guinea I consider prejudicial to good order.
I find, however, that I cannot deport them after trial without the sanction of the High
Commissioner.
7. There is thus great danger of my authority being weakened, and of my difficulties
being increased. I clearly foresee confusion and trouble in the future, which can only bo
avoided by the immediate issue of regulations for the guidance and control of traders and
settlers.
8. According to Mr. Griffith’s opinion, I have not even the power of making any
regulations having the force of law.. I venture therefore again to urge upon your Lordship
the issue of the necessary Order in Council.

Memorandum.
Queensland, Colonial Secretary’s Office,
Brisbane, May 15, 1885.
The Governor of a Colony has not by virtue of his appointment the sovereign
authority delegated to him, and an act done by him on his own authority, unauthorised
either by his Commission, or expressly or impliedly by his instructions, is not equivalent
to such an act being done by the Crown, and is consequently not valid. (Cameron v.
Kyte, 3 Knapp, P.C. 332.)
General Scratchley’s Commission (Blue Book, C. —4,273, 1885, p. 36) recites that
Her Majesty has been pleased to lake under Her protection and jurisdiction the territory
intended to be included in die Protectorate, and appointed him to be Special Commis-
sioner for the Protectorate, and as such Special Commissioner, to act in Her Majesty’s
name and on Her behalf, and, in all respects to represent Her Crown and authority
in matters occurring therein, and further to take all such measures, and to do all
such matters and things, in the Protectorate as in the interests of Her Majesty’s
service he may think expedient, subject to such instructions as lie may from time
to time receive from Her Majesty, or through one of Her Secretaries of State.
The instructions issued to General Scratchley (Blue Book, p. 29) inform him that,
until Her Majesty is pleased to make further provisions for administering law in the
Protectorate, the territory will remain under the operation of the Western Pacific
Orders in Council, and that he will accordingly exercise the authority of a Deputy of
the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific. Some other instructions are given,
none of which, however, authorise General Scratchley to exercise any legislative or
judicial authority.
The Despatch of 17th November from the Secretary of State to the High Commis-
sioner for the Western Pacific, Sir G. W. Des Vosnx (Blue Book, p. 32), states expressly
that General Scratchley will not by virtue of his appointment as Deputy Commissioner
be possessed of legal jurisdiction unless Her Majesty should issue some further Order in
Council under the Foreign Jurisdiction Acts, relating especially to New Guinea. No
such Order in Council has been issued.
It is, I think, clear that General Scratchley’s powers as Special Commissioner are not
more extensive than those of a Governor.
I am therefore of opinion that General Scratchley has at present no legal jurisdiction
and authority of any kind, except such as he can exercise as a Deputy Commissioner for
the Western Pacific, and in particular that he has no power to make any regulations
having the force of law, or to impose or collect any taxes or license fees upon exports
or imports, or otherwise to exercise any legislative or judicial functions in the Protectorate,

SCRATCHLEY, C.M.G. (NEW GUINEA).
Sir, Downing Street, July 10, 1885.
I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Despatch of the Bth of
May,* with its enclosure, respecting an application from a German company for permission
to trade with the natives of that portion of New Guinea which is within the British
Protectorate.
I approve of the course which you took with regard to this application, but it may
be advisable to explain to the Company and to any similar applicants that, although you
are unable to grant such requests until you have taken up your residence in New
Guinea and arrangements are further completed in regard to transactions with natives,
German subjects will eventually be free to frequent places within the Protectorate
and to engage in trade with equal facilities and on the same terms as British
subjects, and that no distinction will be made between subjects of the two nationalities
as regards the collection of revenue or the right to the protection of their persons and
property.
The Orders in Council to which you refer cannot be issued until the Queen’s
Sovereignty has been proclaimed over the part of New Guinea comprised within the
Protectorate and the time for taking that step must depend on the result of the negotia-
tions with the Colonial Governments which you opened in your letter to them of the Ist
of April.f
I am in further communication with the Law Officers of the Crown on the subject of
New Guinea, and the powers of legislation there after it becomes British territory.

MAJOR-GENERAL P. H. SCRATCHLEY, C.M.G. (NEW GUINEA), to the RIGHT HON.
THE EARL OF DERBY, K.G. (Received July 14, 1885.)
My Lord, Melbourne, June 2, 1885.
The result of calling for tenders in Australia for a steamer for six months, fully
manned and found, for service on the coast of New Guinea, has confirmed the opinion I
had formed that this mode of providing means of locomotion would prove to be more
costly than if a vessel were purchased in England and maintained by me for the
service.
2. The lowest of the tenders, which are now under consideration, is 855/. 10s. per
month for a steamer of about 480 tons gross tonnage.
Assuming that this tender is accepted, the annual cost of the steamer will be 10,260/.,
an amount which is beyond what can be afforded in future years.
3. On the other hand, I estimate that a steam vessel could be purchased in England
for the sum of 18,000/. (including fitting out and voyage to Australia), and could be
manned and maintained for about 7,000/. per annum.
Thus in six or seven years a saving would be effected, which would cover the cost of
the vessel.
4. I am also of the opinion that the steamer should be designed specially for the
service, in order to comply with the requirements laid down in the Memorandum which
is annexed to this despatch.
5. Under these circumstances I beg to recommend that the Lords Commissioners of
the Admiralty should be moved to pepare the design of a suitable vessel, and that
reference be made to Rear-Admiral J. C. Wilson, R.N., who is well acquainted with the
requirements of the service.
6. By adopting this course time will be saved, and the order for the vessel could be
given immediately I reported that funds were available for the purchase.

Memorandum for his Excellency the Governor.
Premier’s Office, Melbourne,
June 4, 1885.
The Premier has the honour to advert to your Excellency’s Memorandum of the
15th April ultimo covering two letters from his Excellency Major-General Scratchley,
Special Commissioner for New Guinea, one respecting the payment of this Colony’s
quota of the 15,000/. promised to be contributed by the Australasian Colonies towards
the Government of New Guinea for the year ending Ist June 1885 ; and the other on
the subject of the cost of governing British New Guinea for five years further.
2. With regard to the former, your Excellency was apprised on the 12th ultimo of
the payment of Victoria’s proportion of the 15,000/. This proportion was calculated on
the basis of the populations of the several Colonies at the date of the last census, viz.,
the 3rd April 1881. This mode of apportioning the expense was suggested by Mr.
Service in the absence of any other proposal. No objection to it has been made by
any Colony excepting Queensland, the Government of which proposes that the popu-
lation at 31st December last should be the basis of calculation instead of that at date
of last census. It is not a matter of much moment which method is adopted; the
population at last census, however, is an ascertained quantity, while any statement of
population at 31st December last can only be an estimate. As a matter of fact, how-
ever, this Colony, and it is believed other Colonies, have paid their contribution on the
basis proposed by Mr. Service.
3. The following table shows the populations at date of last census, and the pro-
portions of the subsidy due by eacli Colony under this scheme, viz.:—
It should be added that by general consent the contribution of Fiji was reckoned upon
its proportionate revenue rather than upon population.
4. Mr. Service now begs to refer to the other letter of which your Excellency’s
Memorandum transmitted a copy, a letter in which Major-General Scratchley encloses
a Memorandum for the consideration of the Australasian Governments relating to the
estimated cost of governing British New Guinea.
In this Memorandum the extent inland of the British annexation in New Guinea
is alluded to. This point, however, has since been determined by the agreement between
Germany and Great Britain as communicated by Lord Derby’s telegram of the 25th May
ultimo.
There remains, therefore, nothing further to be said on that subject, except to express
the great disappointment felt by the Government and people of this Colony at the meagre
results of their efforts to secure the whole of Eastern New Guinea for the British Crown.
For good or for evil the matter, with all the incidents which led up to it, passes now into
history.
Bb 3


5. With reference to the estimates of the annual cost of governing submitted by Major-
General Scratchley, Mr. Service desires, in passing, to call your Excellency’s attention to
the method adopted by Germany in reference to the islands recently annexed by that
Power, a method which attains every object desired by Australia in the first instance
almost without any expenditure at all.
6. This Government, however, is not prepared to object to the estimates, nor to the clear
and practical programme of proceedings sketched in Major-General Scratchley’s
memorandum. Mr. Service will, therefore, be prepared to ask Parliament to continue the
contribution of this Colony’s proportion of a subsidy of 15,000 L, until the Imperial
Government has time to decide what portion of the cost of the Government of New
Guinea shall be borne by the Imperial Exchequer.
Having regard, however, to the limited area of territory annexed, and lack of informa-
tion as to the intentions of Her Majesty’s Government, Mr. Service cannot ask
Parliament to grant any increased contribution, either in respect of the annual
expenditure, or the capital, or first cost.
7. Mr. Service will be glad if your Excellency will be so good as to communicate this
Memorandum to his Excellency the Special Commissioner for New Guinea, and also
to the Right Honourable the Secretary of State for the Colonies.

We, William by the Grace of God, German Emperor, King of Prussia, &c., &c. declare
and ordain by these presents : .


Whereas, in August 1884, we promised our protection to an association of German
subjects, which has in the meantime adopted the name of the New Guinea Company, for
a Colonial enterprise undertaken by them in islands of the Western Pacific which are not
under the sovereignty of any other Power :
Whereas this Company has, through an expedition fitted out by itself, acquired and
taken into occupation, under control of our Commission on the spot, harbours and portions
of the coast with a view to cultivation, and to the establishment of commercial stations,
and that these districts were thereupon placed under our protection by our ships of
war.
Whereas the two German firms which had previously erected factories and acquired
territorial rights on a part of those districts, have joined the Company, and whereas the
Company, legally represented by our “ Geheimer Commerzienrath,” Adolph v. Hausemann,
has now shown that it undertakes to create and maintain such political institutions as
will promote commerce and make the land and soil available for cultivation, as well as
bring about and preserve peaceful relations,with, the natives, and all that may conduce
to their civilization, has in making this declaration proposed that to assist in carrying
out these objects, an Imperial letter of protection should delegate to it the right to
exercise territorial sovereignty under our sovereignty, with the exclusive right under
the supervision of our Government of taking unclaimed land into occupation and
disposing of it and concluding contracts with the natives respecting title to landed
property.
We grant to the New Guinea Company this our letter of protection, and confirm
hereby our assumption of the sovereignty over the districts in question.
These districts are—
I. That part of the mainland of New Guinea which is not under British or Dutch
sovereignty.
This district, which, at the proposal of the Company, we have permitted to be called
‘'Kaiser Wilhelm’s Land,” stretches on the north coast of the island from the 141st
degree of longitude (east of Greenwich) to the point in the vicinity of Mitre Rock
where the Bth degree of south latitude cuts the coast, is bounded on the south and west
by a line which follows closely the Bth degree, of latitude up to the point where the latter
is intersected by the 147th degree of east longitude, and then runs in a straight line in
a north-west direction to the intersection point of the 6th degree of south latitude, and
the 144th cast longitude, and again in a north-west direction to the intersection of the
sth degree of south latitude and the 141st degree east longitude, and hence follows this
line of longitude to the sea.
11. The islands lying off this portion of the coast of New Guinea, as well as the
islands of the archipelago whicli has up till now been known as the New Britain
Archipelago, and is now, at the proposal of the Company, and with our authorisation, to
bear the name of Bismarck Archipelago, and all other islands north-cast of New Guinea
situate between the equator and the Bth degree of south latitude, and the 141st and
154th degrees of east longitude.
Moreover we grant to the said Company, in return for their engagement to create and
maintain the political organisation undertaken by them, and to defray the costs of an
adequate administration of justice, herewith the rights implied in territorial sovereignty,
as well as the exclusive right to take into occupation unoccupied land in the protected
territory and to dispose of it, and to conclude contracts with the natives as to territorial
titles, all this being under the supervision of our Government, which will take the neces-
sary steps to guarantee such rights of possession to whicli a former lawful title can be
shown, and to protect the natives.
The regulation of the administration of justice, as well as the direction and conduct of
relations between the protected districts and the foreign Governments remain in the
disposition of our Government.
We promise and order hereby that our officials and officers shall carry out this our
letter of protection by protecting and supporting the Company and its officers in all
lawful ways.
This, our Imperial letter of protection, we grant to the New Guinea Company on
condition that it completes its legal organisation according to the prescriptions of German
law within a year from this date at latest, that the members of its Board of Directors,
or persons otherwise entrusted with the conduct of affairs are members of the German
Empire,“making due -reservation respecting future amplifications of this our letter of
B b 4


protection, and such directions as may issue from our Government with a view to giving
effect to it, as well as such further dispositions as may be found advisable in the exercise
of our sovereignty over the protected territory, to observe which the Company is engaged
under pain of losing their claim to our protection.
In witness whereof we have executed this letter of protection with our own hand, and
sealed it with our Imperial seal.

Decree of the Imperial Chancellor of June 8, 1885.
With reference to their letters of the 25th of March and the Bth and 10th of
April last, I beg to inform the Committee of the New Guinea Company that I have
caused to be published in the Australian press a proclamation of the Imperial Commis-
sioner, von Oertzen, containing the following provisions to be enforced within the
German Protectorate, the limits of which are laid down in the Imperial Charter of May
17th last.
1. New acquisitions of land without consent of the German authorities are invalid, and
none but older and justly acquired rights will be protected.
2. Arms, ammunition, and explosives, as well as spirits, shall not for the present, be
supplied to the natives.
3. Natives are not to be exported from the German Protectorate as labourers, except
from those parts of the Bismarck Archipelago where this has been done before, and
only for employment in German plantations and under the control of German officials.
The Commissioner has already been authorised by telegraph to issue a proclamation
embodying the points mentioned under No. 1.

My Lord, Paris, July 28, 1885.
In my Despatch of the 22nd instant, I had the honour to mention to your
Lordship that the Government had brought into the Chamber of Deputies a Bill to
grant a credit of 1,550,000 francs to be applied to the execution of the law for the
Transportation of Habitual Criminals.
I have not yet been able to obtain a copy of the Bill or of the “ Expose des Motifs,”
with which it was introduced, but I do myself the honour to transmit to your Lordship
* Not'printed.


an extract from an unofficial newspaper which contains a summary of the “ Expose des
Motifs.”
If this summary is to he depended upon, it is intended to spend 400,000 francs
(16,000/.) of the proposed credit upon the establishment of penitentiaries in France, to
which habitual criminals are to be sent in order to prepare them for transportation.
The remaining 1,150,000 francs (46,000/.), if the summary be correct, are destined to
provide for the expense of sending a first batch of criminals to Guyana and of providing
for their maintenance in that colony.
No mention is made in the summary of New Caledonia or any other place in the
Pacific.
I have, &c.
The Marquess of Salisbury, K.G., (Signed) Lyons.

P.S.—Since I finished the preceding Despatch 1 have succeeded in obtaining the
enclosed copies of the Bill and “ Expose des Motifs.” So far as I can judge from a
hasty perusal, the “Expose des Motifs” seems to tally with the summary in the
unofficial newspaper.

“ Journal des 27th July 1885.
Nouvelles Pablementaires.
On a distribud hier aux deputes un projet dc loi portant ouverture d’un credit de
1,550,000 fr. en vue de la premidre application de la loi sur la relegation des recidivistes.
Sur cette somme, 1,150,000 fr. sont destines au ministcre de la marine et le reste au
ministere de I’interieur.
L’exposd des motifs du projet de loi rappelle que le ministdre de I’intdrieur, aux
termes de I s article 12 de la loi, devra placer dans un penitender special, pendant tout
ou partie de la duree des dernidres peines a subir avant leur envoi hors de France, les
individus centre lesquels la relegation aura etc prononcee.
Ces penitenciers speciaux n’auront pas seulement pour but de sdparer les condamnes
qui doivent quitter la France des autres categories de detenus qu’il y aurait danger a
laisser confondus avee eux; ils devront encore les preparer a la relegation par I’appren-
tissage dc certains metiers ou professions, par un regime de travail et de vie approprie
a leur situation et par un classement repondant a leur conduite et leur destination
eventuelle.
C’est pour faire face aux depenses occasionnees par I’etablissement de ces penitenciers
que le credit de 400,000 fr. est ouvert au ministcre de I’intdrieur.
Quant au credit de 1,150,000 fr., il doit servir au ministcre de la marine h effectuer
le premier envoi de relegues a la Guyane et a subvenir a leur entretien dans la
colonie.
L’cxpose des motifs constate, a ce propos, que la nouvelle loi doit dtre rendue
executoire le 27 novembre prochain. Un convoi de relegues pourra etre dirige, au
cours du l er trimestre de 1886, sur le territoire de Maroni, dans la colonie de la Guyane,
territoire que la commission extraparlementaire, qui elabore le rdglement d’adrainistra-
tion publique, a designe pour recevoir le premier contingent de recidivistes. Ce premier
convoi se composera de 1,000 reldguds.
Sur le erddit demande de 1,150,000 fr. 210,000 fr. sont destines au personnel

Projet de loi portant ouverture au Ministre de ClnUrieur et au Ministre de la Marine
et des Colonies , sur VExercice 1885, d'un credit extraordinaire de I,sso,ooo francs
pour Vapplication do la loi sur la relegation des recidivisfes, {R envoy 6 ala
Commission du Budget.)
Presente au nom :
De M. Jules Grew, President de la Kepublique franqaise.
Par M. Allain-Targe, Ministre de I’lnterieur,
Par M. le Vicc-Amiral Galiber. Ministre de la Marine et des Colonies,
Et par M. Sadi Carnot, Ministre des Finances.
Exposi des Motifs.
I.
Messieurs, —La loi du 27 mai 1885, sur la relegation des recidivistes sera, aux tenues
de son article 21, executoire a dater de la promulgation du premier reglement d’adminis-
tration publique destine a en organiser et, conformement a I’article 18, ce
premier reglement devra etre rendu dans le delai de 6 mois au plus, a partir du 28 mai
1885, jour de la promulgation de la loi.
Le projet de decret a rendre en forme de reglement d’administration publique, est
actuellement elabore pour etre sounds au Conseil d’Etat, et les mesures d’execution
doivent etre prdparees, d’apres les dispositions memes de la loi, avant le jour ou la relega-
tion sera mise en pratique.
II est spdcifie, en effet, dans I’art. 12, que les individus, centre lesquels la relegation
aura etc prononcee pourront etre places dans un penitencier special pendant tout ou
partie de la duree des peines a subir avant leur envoi hors de France. Faculte
est laissde au gouvernement de devancer I’expiration de ces dernieres peines pour
effectuer le transferemcnt des condamnes aux colonies. Enfin, les penitenciers speciaux
pourront recevoir les individus dont la peine sera expiree, mais qui auront a etre maintenus
en depot jusqu’au plus procliain depart pour le lieu de relegation.
Les penitenciers ou depots de relegation ne serviront pas seulement a separer les
condamnes qui doivent quitter la France des autres categories de detenus qu’il y aurait
inconvenient ou danger a laisser confondus avec eux, ils serviront aussi k les preparer a
la relegation par I’apprentissage de certains metiers ou professions, par un regime de
travail et de vie approprie a leur situation, par un classement rdpondant a leur conduite,
a leurs aptitudes, a leurs forces, a leur destination eventuelle.
C’est I’organisation de ces etablissements que larticie 38 de la loi renvoie a un
reglement d’administration publique et il importe que les moyens d’y pourvoir d6s le
debut soient assures par les Chambres avant leur separation.
Le Gouvernement se preoccupe sans doute de restreindre autant que possible les
depenses, notamraent en utilisant les emplacements et b&timents dont il pourra disposer.
Mais les Etablissements nouveaux ne peuvent evidemment se confondre avec les maisons
penitentiaires existantes, et il convient d’ajouter que celles-ci semblent juste suffire aux
besoins actuels des services auxquels elles sont affectees. Les importantes reductions
realisdes au budget de 1885 et continuees au budget de 1886 ont entraind, en effet, la
suppression d’une maison centrale d’hommes h, Aniane (Hdrault), dune maison centrale
de femmes a Auberive (Haute-Marne) et d’un penitencier agricole a Casabianda (Corse).
Ce dernier domaine, pour differentes raisons, auxquelles sejoignent des prdoccupations
d’dconomie, n’a pas paru, d’aprds les decisions de la Chambre, pouvoir continuer a
recevoir des detenus. Quant aux batiments des deux maisons centrales supprimees, ils
ont dd dtre affectes sans retard a d’autres services, et leur situation, leur dtat ne les
aurait pas rendus propres a I’installation de penitenciers ou depdts de relegation.
Meme en comptant utiliser, par une affectation nouvelle, des irameubles non rattaches
actuellement aux services penitentiaires, on ne peut done se dispenser de prdvoir et
d’assurer sans retard les travaux d’appropriation, I’extension des locaux a occuper,
I’amonagement intcrieur et exterieur des immeubles, la fourniture des objets mobiliers,
les traitements et emoluments du personnel qui sera charge de faire fonctionner les
etablissements, pour le moment ou ils recevront les premiers envois de condamnes.

Bien que le Gbuvernement se propose d’observer une grande reserve dans ces travaux /
et mesures d’organisation, et de ne creer de penitenciers speciaux que selon les necessites
constatees, comrae I’cxecution de la loi ne pourrait etre laissee en suspens faute de
ressources, une demande de credits extraordinaires afferents a I’exercice 1885 semble
s’imposer d’urgence.
Pour I’application dventuelle de la loi aux condamnes avant leur depart de Prance, les
provisions de depenses repondant aux besoins ci-dessus mentionnes seinbient pouvoir etre
dvaluees a la somme de 400,000 francs, sauf par le Gouverneraent a ne faire emploi de
cette somme que dans la limite des necessitds qui ne peuvent etre exactement determinees
avant I’adoption du premier rbglement d’administration publique, et sous reserve des
credits a demandedulterieurement aux Chambres pour I’exercice 1886, en justifiant des
mesures qui auront dtO deja prises et des depenses qui auront ete deja effectuees.

D’un autre cotd, la loi devant etre rendue exOcutoire le 2/ novembre, au plus tard, un
convoi de relegucs pourra etre dirige, au cours du premier trimestre 1886, sur le
territoire du Maroni, dans la colonie de la Gu} 7 ane, territoire que la commission
cxtraparleraentaire, qui elabore le rbglement d’administration publique, a designe pour
recevoir le premier contingent de recidivistes.
II convient done de preparer, dOs a present, les installations necessaires aux relOgues et
au personnel dirigeant, de passer des marches pour la fourniture des vivres,. des
medicaments, des effets d’habillement et de couch age, des outils et matieres qui leur
seront indispensables.
En ce qui concerne le personnel libre, on a prevu seulement les fonctionnaires et agents
qui doivent assurer les premieres mesures a prendre pour I’installation des recidivistes a
Saint-Louis du Maroni. On a inscrit, h, cet effet, les fonds necessaires pour le paye-
ment de la solde et des accessoires pendant le dernier trimestre de 1885.
Pour les vivres et pour les hopitaux, on a eu en vue de constituer des approvisionne-
ments destines a faire face aux besoins du premier trimestre 1886, en calculant sur une
moyenne de 1,000 relegues.
11 resulte, en consequence, du detail ci-apres indiqud que le credit extraordinaire a

Sir, Downing Street, August 14, 1885.
I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Despatch of the 28th of
May§, and to convey to you ray approval of the appointment of Mr. Anthony Musgravo
as Assistant Deputy Commissioner for the New Guinea Protectorate at a salary of 7001.
per annum.
I would, however, point out that the permanency of this appointment, or of any other
appointments connected with the Protectorate of New Guinea, will depend entirely upon
the continued provision of funds for the payment of salaries, and 1 have no doubt that
you will bear in mind that the funds which are likely to be available will not bear
further salaries calculated on so liberal a scale.
Appointments of this nature must be held to be liable to be terminated at any moment
without notice or compensation.
I have also had the honour to receive your Despatch of the 28th of May,|(
reporting the circumstances in which you had detailed Mr. Musgrave to represent you
with the expedition to be sent from Queensland in charge of the natives of New Guinea
whom it was decided to return to their homes, and containing a copy of the Commission
which you had issued to that gentleman as Assistant Deputy Commissioner.
As I have reason to believe that Deputy Commissioner Romilly accompanied the
expedition, although the particulars of the case are not before me, it is unnecessary for
me to express any opinion in respect of the course which you contemplated.
You are, however, aware that Mr. Musgrave, as Assistant Deputy Commissioner, will
not be competent to exercise the same judicial authority as Mr. Romilly and yourself,
or other officers holding Commissions as Deputy Commissioners under the Western
Pacific Orders in Council, who by virtue of that office possess the judicial powers vested
in the High Commission Court, subject to the limitation of punishment in criminal cases
fixed by the principal Order of 1877.
