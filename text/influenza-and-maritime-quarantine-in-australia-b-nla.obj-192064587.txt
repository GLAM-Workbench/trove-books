PREFACE.
It became necessary, during the last eight months, to apply the
principles of maritime quarantine in the case of a disease presenting peculiar
difficulties. The experience was one of singular interest to the student of
epidemiology, and the results achieved are notable. During October,
November, and December, 1918, there raged in all other countries an epidemic
of influenza of intense virulence and most exalted infectivity. No other
country attempted a quarantine defence, and the contrast between the
absolute immunity enjoyed by Australia and the appalling death-rate in
adjacent countries was sufficient evidence of the success of the defensive
measures adopted. This immunity persisted until the end of January, when
a variety of influenza became prevalent in Australia.
This variety has been characterized by a much lower infectivity, evidenced
by a slower rate of spread, and a death-rate so much lower than that
experienced in oversea countries that it is hardly comparable.
The contrast may be stated concisely.
Philadelphia experienced an epidemic complete in six weeks, reaching
for the week of maximum mortality a death-rate of 261 per 100,000 of
population, the total death-rate for the whole epidemic being much greater.
South Africa and New Zealand experienced epidemics complete in eight
weeks, and responsible for a total mortality rate, in the former case of 826
per 100,000 amongst Europeans only, and in the latter case of 517 per 100,000.
In Australia the epidemic has been of more lingering character, having
lasted already more than four months, presenting certain clinical differences,
and never rising in any State beyond a maximum weekly death-rate of
33 per 100,000.
The difference is striking.
There is no evidence of any traceable connexion between any quarantined
vessel and any shore epidemic; there was a period of four weeks between the
arrival of the last infected vessel and the first shore case notified. There is,
in fact, no positive evidence that the influenza in Australia was due to the
escape of infection through the quarantine first line of defence. There is,
on the other hand, both in the nature of the disease, and the history of
influenza in Australia, during the past twelve months, much evidence in
support of the hypothesis that the present epidemic form of influenza is the
product of a slow evolution of an influenza already established in Australia
in July and August, 1918. That evidence is detailed in the pages of this
pamphlet,
A review of our experience of ship epidemics leads to the conclusion that
neither inhalation, inoculation, nor isolation of the sick will of itself stop an
epidemic, that exhaustion of susceptible material plays little part, and thai:
the factor which determines the course of the epidemic is the inherent nature
and vigour of the infecting agent. It has to be admitted that no adminis-
trative measure was successful in modifying the time factor of any ship
epidemic, although there is some reason for believing that the measures
employed were, by their combined influence, successful in reducing the
potential volume of actual cases.


This failure to cheek the spread of infection within the limits of a single
shin community is the natural result of ignorance of the identity of the
infecting agent, and is a strong argument for increased provision for
investigation of infectious diseases, in which field Australia is much behind
ot “uamntine Service has. during seven months-October. 1918, to
April 1919 —dealt with 149 uninfected vessels and 174 infected vessels, wi
a total personnel of 81,610 persons, including 1,102 actual patents.
This has been a heavy tax on the resources of the Quarantine be
in accommodation, equipment, and personnel, and the e^P poims
strongly to the necessity for increase m each of these sections
org of epidemics ig that a variety of infectious diseases
assume a world-wide prevalence during periods of post-war readjustm ,
and” may be confidently expected that history will repeat itself during the
variety of administrative situations which have developed
during the past eight months, there has been none so sharply defined, and
none !o productive of confusion, as the fundamental failure to secure uniformity
"on amongst the various sovereign Governments in the P~ *
threatened epidemic. It must have become obvious that there is pres g
necessity for either the vesting of controlling authority m the Commonwea
Government, or some mode of securing a binding compact to which all States
and the Commonwealth can subscribe, and will adhere.
The failure of the attempt made by various States to insure e ec
land frontier quarantine has been self-evident. .
The question of the use of prophylactic inoculation with a composit
vaccine was considered at an early stage. Upon the first opportu y
was made, with results that were so satisfactory that vaccine ™

in Chapter VII Mr. Cherry’s conclusions are discussed by Dr. I enfold

the mortality from influenza much more than justified its use

Service has already, during the first year of its existence, been amply
Although this pamphlet is issued under the name of a single writer, it
must be made clear that much of the preliminary work necessary for its
production, and some of the actual text, has been done by various membe
of the Medical Staff of the Quarantine Service. The necessity that o
person should assume responsibility for making and stating 6■uc x ° ns
epidemiological importance provides the reason for the publication of t
pamphlet in my name. Acknowledgment is however, freely; made.of much
loyal, efficient, and untiring assistance by the whole professio
staff of the Quarantine Service.

CHAPTER I.
BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE HISTORY OF INFLUENZA IN
AUSTRALIA.
1820.
The earliest recorded appearance of influenza in Australia is to be found
in the Sydney Almanack of 183 d, in which there is a chronological table of
■events from the foundation of the colony to 1832, to which there is appended
the following note, relative to the first visitation of influenza :
“ The complaint was general, many of the inhabitants were consigned to the grave
in a few days from the violence and fury of the attack, and some few have to this day
the remains of the visitation still as a painful companion. Great numbers of the poor
aborigines fell victims to this novel and severe distemper. Mr. Roland Hassall, a gentle-
man universally beloved as a pious, benevolent, and valuable member of society, and
who had been a resident in the colony for over twenty years, died 20th August, 1820.”
[Extract from “ In Old Australia,” by Rev. J. S. Hassall, Brisbane, 1902.]
1826.
No further reference to this disease appears until 1826. In Cunningham’s
Two Years in New South Wales (Vol. 1., p. 172) —
An epidemic of influenza carried off a number of the old Europeans some years ago,
and also not a few of the aborigines, while many of our younger individuals occasionallv
feel the effects of it to this day. It appeared at the time, or immediately in the rear, of a,
hot northern wind, the symptoms being violent headaches, cough, sneezing, and inflamed
eyes, with quick pulse, and other general febrile concomitants. This year (1826) it has
again fatally visited the colony.
1836.
The London Medical Gazette (Vol. XX., 1836—7, p 129), under the heading
The Influenza,” contains the following paragraph :
By letters from Sydney, dated the 14th October, we learn that the influenza had
then recently made its appearance, and was spreading in that part of the world, and by
the communication of Mr. Brande, on page 114 of our present number, the disease appears
to have shown itself at the Cape on the Ist November. It broke out in the northern
parts of Scotland before the end of last year, and had been prevalent somewhat sooner in
the countries bordering on the shores of the Baltic, so that its occurrence there and in
New South Wales seems to have been nearly or altogether contemporaneous, a fact
sufficiently remarkable when we consider the great difference of geographical situation
•and extreme dissimilarity of climate in those regions.
1817.
On the authority of Dr. Springthorpe ( Australian Medical Journal 1892,
p. 193), the pandemic of 1817 appears to have visited Victoria.
The epidemics of 1838 and 1847 appear, on the authority of Hall {vide
infra), to have visited Tasmania.
Dr. Watson* states that in October and November, 1838, fatality amongst
cases of influenza in the Sydney Hospital was 14*3 per cent.
1852.
The next reference is that given by Hall in the article which will be fully
quoted. He states, referring to Tasmania—” In 1852-3 there was a severe
visitation in this island, and at that time animals of all kinds were affected ;
* History of the Sydney Hospital, p 75.


dogs especially died in great numbers ; but the human mortality was not
anything to equal that of the present epidemic. Moreover, I have not
observed any animals to be subjected to its influence this year.
1860.
In 1860 there was a general epidemic throughout Australia, though the
references to it are, with one exception, rather scanty.
In the annual report of the Central Board of Health for "V ictoria for
1860-61 there is the following statement
During the first half of this year influenza and malignant disease of the throat were
very prevalent, the former spreading in some districts epidemically. The disease has
been attributed in almost all cases to atmospheric causes, such as the prevalence of
easterly winds, sudden and unusual changes of temperature, and impurities produced
bv the exhalations from accumulations of stagnant water; but it has not spread with
any regularity, appearing first in one district, then in another very remote, and again
reappearing in its original locality, nor has it been marked by particular conditions
which would refer the epidemic to any special cause.
In the report for 1861 there is a reference to the undue prevalence of
influenza during 1860, but there is no mention of influenza as having been
prevalent in 1861, although there is an exhaustive discussion of the pre-
valence of other zymotic diseases. It may reasonably be assumed that
there was no special prevalence on influenza in the form of a second epidemic
during 1861.
In New South Wales there is no record in medical literature of any out-
break, but the annual report of the Kegistrar-General for 1860 contains
a reference to the epidemic prevalent in that year. and P., N.S.W.
Parliament 1861-2, Vol. 12.)
A very complete account of the epidemic as it affected lasmama in 1860
has been left for our information by Dr. E. S. Hall, whose accuracy of
observation, and lucidity and completeness of description, make his records
always especially valuable. The description is in the Australian Medical
Journal (October, 1860, p. 252).
Hall records that “ influenza has recently prevailed throughout all the Australian
colonies together with New Zealand and Tasmania. The epidemic commenced its
ravages’in Hobarton with the first day of the month of July, 1860, though it had
been prevailing in Sydney and elsewhere on the Australian Continent for many weeks
previously ” The last cases in Hobart occurred on the 28th July, but the greatest number
of attacks, as well as deaths, happened between the 10th and 23rd inclusive. This would
indicate an epidemic of three phases—the initial rise, lasting ten days ; the second period
of maximum prevalence lasting fourteen days; and finally a sharp drop, lasting about a
W6t ln Hobart, Hall estimates that of a total population of about 25,000, more than
23,000 were attacked. ~ ...
Durino- the month 30 deaths were registered from influenza, but Hall states that
many deaths from other alleged causes should be attributed to influenza. _ Of the deaths
under “ Croup,” he says :—“ To ‘ Croup,’ the first disease in the table in the zymotic
class, six deaths are ascribed, all of them children between fourteen and thirty-four
months old. To one of the cases I was called in consultation a few hours previous to the
demise, and the croupy symptoms were only the terminating stage of the influenza,
under which it had been suffering for some days. The same, I believe, was the history
of the other five cases. In many adults, myself amongst the number, the most urgent
symptoms of the influenza, in its first onset, was an affectation of the glottis, threatening
suffocation. In many children that recovered, this symptom came on at a later stage of
the the epidemic clinically, Hall states “ The attacks generally commenced
with chills, pains all over the body, irritation about the trachea, larynx, and fauces, great
prostration of strength, and total loss of appetite. This was followed by a suffocative
cough, copious acrid discharge from the nose and eyes, with intense pain and sense ot


fulness in the antri and frontal cells, and inability to sleep. In the severe cases which
recovered some amendment took place after the fifth or sixth day, but leaving great
weakness. Ido not remember any invasion of epidemic influenza ever before so general
or fatal; and being always an early sufferer on these occasions in England, as well as in
this colony, I have paid much attention to this disease."’
Hall states that there can be little doubt but that the epidemic hastened a fatal end
in many cases of tuberculosis, and “ it is almost superfluous to remark that all the deaths
recorded from pneumonia during July might all have been correctly registered as caused
by the prevailing epidemic. The type was quite asthenic and the congestion of the
lungs very great. In many cases copious serous effusion into the pericardium accompanied
it.”
The death records for this month show two outstanding features —the deaths from
influenza, and the deaths from pneumonia, which were far above the normals for each of
these diseases.
The climatic features were as follows The mean temperature was in excess of the
standard mean for Hobart; the atmospheric pressure was more continuously high than
was ever before noted for any month, “ never before occurred a month so remarkable
for calms and light winds ” ; rain fell on eleven days of the month, but the total was below
the mean : the electrometer this month gave more numerous responses than it has done
for a long time past. In June there was scarcely an indication of atmospheric electricity,
but in July 26 negative and 8 positive are noted. The positive, it is to be particularly
remarked," occurred between the 9th and 19th only, or within that period of the month
during which the greatest fatality of the epidemic existed.
Hall adopts without question the hypothesis that the climatic influences were respon-
sible for the appearance of the epidemic. For example, speaking of ozone, he says :
‘ ■ I cannot help concluding that our large amount of ozone, as compared with English
observations, or even with those in the cities of continental Australasia, was the means of
mitigating the severity of the late epidemic, and enabling the young and the healthy to
escape from its attacks comparatively unscathed. It is a legitimate inference that the
aerial poison, which was so virulent and destructive to all ages in Sydney, became so
greatly weakened and neutralized when it reached Hobarton by the more abundant
prevalence of ozone in Tasmania, that only the aged, feeble, and diseased succumbed to
the epidemic.”
In another publication in 1863 Hall reviews the history of influenza in
Tasmania as follows :
Influenza *—Both epidemic influenza and ordinary catarrh are of frequent occurrence
in Tasmania. They are often confounded together in the registry. In 1838 this country
suffered in the months of October, November, and December severely, from what was
commonly called influenza, but which was, in fact, catarrh of asthenic character, frequently
merging into acute bronchitis and pneumonia, and requiring depletory treatment. At
that time the temperature was very variable ; but strong, cold, dry winds from the
southerly quarters generally prevailed. In November, 1847, asthenic catarrh from like
causes was general throughout the island. In 1851-2 influenza was epidemic throughout
this island and the other Australian colonies, and animals suffered considerably, particularly
dogs, which died in great numbers. The asthenic character was extreme, and all depletory
treatment was inadmissible. In 1860 epidemic influenza was universal in all the Australian
colonies, and from thence, nearly a month later, reached Tasmania in July. In many
families not a member escaped, and the deaths were numerous ; for though only 41 appear
in the returns from “ influenza ” directly, many more cases were fatal by terminating in
pneumonia, &c. In fact, in the month of July, when the disease was at its acme, the total
deaths of the month were more than double the average of the previous five years, and
nearly three times as many as in July, 1859. Young people suffered comparatively
little, but it proved terribly severe and destructive to those far advanced in age. Its
type was extremely asthenic. Atmospheric pressure was more continuously high than was
ever before noted for many months. Calms were unusually prevalent. Rainfall was
small. Ozone was somewhat below the usual rate. The weather, indeed, corresponded
very much with that stated to have marked the outbreak of cholera in London in
1832-49-54, with the exception that ozone was not absent in Tasmania as it was in London.
Animals were not attacked to the same extent as in 1851—2. The disease was over in
August 4 but in September catarrh of asthenic character, merging frequently into acute
pneumonia, and requiring the lancet, occurred, and was confounded with the previous
epidemic. In this month the weather was very different from its previous state ; but the
mortality was the highest recorded for any of the previous five Septembers.

1884.
After tlie epidemic in 1860 there is no reference to influenza in Australian
medical literature until 1884, when in the Australasian Medical Gazette there
appears the statement that “ measles, diphtheria, and influenza are very
prevalent at Dunolly (Victoria). — Australa ian Medical Gazette, 1884, 213.)
1885.
In 1885 influenza was prevalent in Victoria. Its features are described
thoroughly by Springthorpe. — {Australian Medical Journal, October, 1885.)
1886.
In 1886 there was a definite continuation of this epidemic of influenza
in South Australia, and references to it are to be found in the current medical
journals. These references are unfortunately scanty, but one account by
Dr. Jay, of Adelaide, is available ( Australasian Medical Gazette, April, 1886,
164). Jay records his experiences of “the recent epidemic of influenza in and
about Adelaide.” He refers to the epidemic as having been prevalent
“ about two or three months ago.” He speaks of it as a variously named
epidemic, which has recently visited various parts of Australia and Tasmania.
The disease is stated to have originated in Melbourne, and to have spread from
there to the neighbouring colonies. 44 Its origin is obscure, it passes rapidly
over extensive areas, rarely remaining more than two or at the outside three
months, and fortunately the interval between one epidemic and another is
generally a long one. . . . There can be little doubt that the disease is
imported by some contagious virus, and the means by which it spread from
one to another is the breath.”
Dr. Jay refers to five main aspects of the disease—(l) intense frontal head-
ache ; (2) acute laryngitis amounting in children to oedema of the glottis ;
(3) lung complications—bronchitis, pneumonia, and pleurisy, which have been
more than ordinarily frequent as complications during this late epidemic ;
(4) extreme prostration and depression of spirits ; (5) the effect on parturition.
Jay mentions that the symptoms closely resemble the course of a severe
catarrh.
1885-1890.
In the Transactions of the Intercolonial Medical Congress of 1889, Spring-
thorpe (p. 101) deals with the period between the epidemic of 1885
and the great epidemic of 1890, He refers to his previous paper (vide supra)
“ upon the great epidemic of influenza which had visited Australasia during
that year, and which was locally known amongst our public as 4 fog fever,’ ”
It was therein shown that influenza had reappeared after many years of com-
parative absence in a severe and widely epidemic form ; that beginning in
May it reached its acme in August, prevailed over a large part of Australasia,
attacking a very large percentage of the population of Victoria. 44 Obser-
vation has shown that a disease with the same general characteristics as that
already described has returned each autumn and winter since 1885, and has
been specially well marked during this late winter.”
Springthorpe recorded 44 it seems certain that the poison attacks the system
through the medium of the air, though whether the materies morbi be a
specific microbe, or a peculiar atmospheric condition, remains problematic
as ever.” ’


1880 and after.
The list of deaths for each year from influenza in Victoria is shown as
follows :—‘
1880 .. .. 22 1893 .. .. 206
1881 .. .. 14 1894 .. .. 201

1890 .. .. 164 1903 .. .. 129
1891 .. .. 1,035 1904 .. .. 257
1892 .. .. 11l
During 1890 cases of influenza were reported towards the end of March,
and after prevailing in an epidemic form throughout Victoria for three or four
months, it gradually died away. The disease prevailed very generally over
the colony, but it did not assume a virulent form. During 1891 the disease
reappeared, and as was the case in Europe and America, the disease assumed
a more virulent form. It was by far the most fatal of the communicable
diseases during the year ; besides the deaths reported as due directly to
influenza, there was also a considerable increase over the average mortality
from bronchitis and pneumonia.
The epidemic was somewhat later in its occurrence than in 1890, in this
respect pursuing the same course as in Europe. Until the end of August
the deaths in the metropolitan area during the year amounted to nine; in
September there was an enormous rise in the mortality, the number of deaths
recorded in that month being 90 ; in October the deaths rose to a maximum,
234 being reported ; in November and December the numbers fell to 58 and 16
respectively.
After 1891, as will be seen from the table of mortalities, the disease has
never been absent, occasionally breaking out in epidemic form, but always
producing some appreciable mortality.
Carstairs records his opinion that the epidemic of 1885 was identical
with the epidemic of 1890. —(Intercolonial Medical Congress, 1892, p. 612.)
“ In Sydney in 1890 the epidemic made its appearance during the early
part of March ; during the first four weeks thereafter there was a small but
increasing number of cases ; then the two succeeding weeks each yielded a
large number of fresh invasions ; in the seventh week-the number lessened
considerably, and during the eighth and ninth weeks the outbreak declined
more rapidly to its close during the tenth, i.e ., the first week in May. Few
and scattered cases were heard of as late as the end of October.
In Sydney and others among the larger cities, if its progress was not
actually slow, it was at all events anything rather than exceedingly swift;
and when areas of country come to be regarded, it appears that its extension
was deliberate, and in no case faster than a man could travel.” (Thompson,
Influenza Report.)


The 1891 epidemic in Sydney commenced in the third week of August,
and was all over by the first week in October. Scattered cases occurred
continuously in the period between the 1890 and 1891 epidemics —these
cases being more frequent during the seven months after the first epidemic
and the three months before the second epidemic. The five months, January
to June, 1891, appear to have been comparatively free.
The 1891 epidemic is definitely stated to have been of a more virulent
type than the 1890 epidemic, thus agreeing with the experience in Melbourne.
The difference appears to have been due to the greater amount of pulmonary
complications.
In 1895 Springthorpe, reviewing the experience since the 1885 epidemic,
states that the epidemic then prevalent {i.e., 1895) “ presented severe
pulmonary complications in many, and an unusual prostration in a still larger
number. The pulmonary complications of the present outbreak have been,
in my experience, mainly pleuro-pneumonia, broncho-pneumonia, and
pneumonia. As usual, all have been patchy, often insidious in onset, apt to
remain stationary, and unduly resistent of treatment. It seems probable
that the influenza bacillus and not the pneumococcus is the actual cause of
the pneumonia in many cases.” (A.M.G., 1895, p. 472.)
In England the 1890 epidemic began about October, 1889, and had died
out at the end of the first quarter of 1890. The second epidemic began
about the end of April, 1891, and subsided about July. The third epidemic
began about October, 1891, and had subsided by February, 1892.
The history of the disease since 1890 is that of continued prevalence
broken by occasional epidemic waves of irregular occurrence.
The 1890-91 epidemic violently affected the death-rates in every State
except Queensland, where the rise was only slight. The minor epidemic of
1894-5 was seen in every State. The 1898-9 outbreak was severe in every
State except New South Wales, where it produced but slight result. Since that
time until 1918 there has been a definite decline in New South Wales, Victoria,
and South Australia, but in Queensland there have been two distinct epidemic
years, 1904 and 1907. The death-rates for each State from 1880 to 1918
are given in the table in Chapter V., in which also is shown a graph of the
course of influenza since 1880.


CHAPTER II.
THE QUARANTINE MEASURES ADOPTED IN AUSTRALIA
AGAINST INFLUENZA.
During July, 1918, unofficial advices were being received by the Quarantine
Service that there was evidence of an impending epidemic prevalence of a
severe form of influenza. In the United Kingdom and on the Continent of
Europe the epidemic of influenza was widespread, although not at that stage
exhibiting a very pronounced virulence. The history of the epidemic of
1891, however, suggested the possibility of this initial phase developing into
a more severe and virulent form of the disease. The situation, therefore,
was carefully watched for any indication of this change in type, and as infor-
mation from various official and unofficial sources became more and more
definite, instructions were issued to all officers of the service to make inquiries
from all incoming vessels, to collect information from any source available,
and to report any indications of danger which they might meet with during
their routine operations.
In the early part of October it became apparent that the disease had
progressed in its march around the world to such an extent that it was
approaching within striking distance of Australia, and accordingly instructions
were issued to all officers of the Quarantine Service to order into quarantine
any vessel which had had any cases of influenza during the voyage. The neces-
sity for these instructions was confirmed a few days later, when advices were
received that a severe and virulent epidemic was prevalent in South Africa.
This necessitated careful consideration of the measures that should be applied
as portion of the quarantine system of defence beyond* the detaining of the
vessel in quarantine.
The initial difficulty that presented itself was the difficulty in establish-
ing a diagnosis of influenza, particularly under conditions which any
quarantine system would have to fulfil, namely, accepting the statements
of ships’ staffs. Influenza is, amongst all diseases, the one concerning which
confusion in diagnosis, particularly in mild cases, is likely to arise, and there-
fore it was considered necessary to include under the term influenza all
forms of febrile disturbances which might reasonably be considered as being
either mild cases of influenza, or likely to lead to confusion in diagnosis.
Accordingly, under the powers contained in the Quarantine Act of proclaiming
a disease as a “ quarantinable disease,” the following phraseology was
adopted :
“ Influenza, or any febrile, toxic, septicsemic condition similar to
influenza, is hereby declared to be a quarantinable disease.”
At that time the degree of public alarm existing in both South Africa
and New Zealand, and reflected on the public within the Commonwealth,


and the unknown nature of the disease, necessitated an attempt to cover all
possible or problematical risks. The following measures were therefore
adopted :
All vessels from South Africa or Zealand were required, whether they
were infected or not, to perform a seven days’ period of quarantine detention
for observation. In the case of South Africa, an exception was made if the
Master could furnish a Statutory Declaration that there had been no .contact
with the shore during the stay of the vessel at that port. If this statement
could be given and accepted, and no case had occurred during the voyage,
the vessel was given pratique immediately. This period of quarantine
observation was imposed principally on account of the fact that maritime
quarantine principles have not been put into practice in respect of a
disease like influenza within the Commonwealth at any time, and it was
necessary, in order to cover what was a really serious risk, that possible, as
well as definite, dangers should be provided against. The seven-day period
was adopted very much on the same basis ; no warrant existed for the adoption
of this purely arbitrary period, as has been shown in the chapters in which the
results of the experience of these measures is recorded. It is now known
that the seven-day period was longer than was necessary, and the quarantine
detention for observation in the case of a ship concerning which it could be
definitely established that there had been no case during the voyage was
unnecessary, in that it covered no risk which would not have been covered by
the detention only of vessels which were definitely infected during the voyage.
With the existence of epidemic influenza in other countries, the Masters
of all oversea vessels were also required to verify and supplement the answer
to Question 5 (c) of the Primary Health Report, as to the existence of quaran-
tinable disease, by a Statutory Declaration that no case of—
(1) Influenza or any condition resembling it,
(2) Acute febrile attack,
(3) Pneumonia,
(1) Acute infection of the lungs of any kind,
had occurred on the vessel during the voyage.
Necessary inquiry had to be made by Masters from Ships’ Medical Officers
and from Medical Officer of Troops before this could be given, and these
officers were required to countersign the declaration if the Master were able
to sign it. It will be noted that this declaration is made comprehensive
enough to cover pulmonary conditions that might have had influenza as their
causal agent, as well as acute febrile conditions, the cause of which was not
apparent.
The difficulty presented by the possibility of a “ carrier ” infection could
either estimated nor provided against in the absence of any definite
knowledge, nor, obviously, could the correct means of covering this risk be
known. It was, however, necessary to decide upon a policy concerning
this possible source of risk as it did not a,ppear to be wise to ignore it, and, as
nothing better suggested itself, it was provisionally assumed that in this
disease infection made its entry into the body through the nasopharynx, and
that region would be the seat of any bacterial agent which might be trans


mitted by a carrier. As all quarantine measures have been framed to deal
•with masses rather than individuals, no ordinary method of attempting to
disinfect the nasopharynx in individuals could be attempted. A survey of
the various means which had been proposed for disinfection of nasopharynges
en masse showed that the zinc-sulphate inhalation method adopted by the
Allied armies for the disinfection of men on a large scale in the presence of
meningitis gave results which were better than any results which could be
claimed for any other method. Accordingly this method was adopted with
rigid adhesion to the details as prescribed for the Allied armies, and on all
vessels the personnel were required to undergo this system of treatment daily.
Details of the methods adopted and the results of the experience of the
Quarantine Service are given in another chapter.
On all vessels which were detained, a daily thermometer parade was held,
every person on board being paraded, and temperature taken in each case ;
any person showing a temperature of 99 degrees or over was isolated for
observation.
Uninfected vessels which, having completed their period of quarantine
detention for observation without the development of any suspicious case,
and the daily exposure of all persons to inhalation treatment, were released.
The quarantine period of detention of clean vessels for observation was applied
only in the case of vessels from New Zealand, from South Africa, and from
certain of the Pacific Islands, concerning which information could only be
obtained by irregular and unreliable channels. From other countries only
infected vessels were detained.
In the case of infected vessels it was necessary to take other steps. These
vessels naturally divided themselves into two classes-—those with cases on
board on arrival, and those which had had cases on board, but on which there
was no case on arrival, the epidemic having presumably subsided. The
measures, therefore, were adopted accordingly.
Vessels which had had cases during the voyage on which there had been
no case for fourteen days prior to arrival were detained only for three days,
during which time the daily thermometer parade and inhalation treatment was
carried out. If at the end of three days no suspicious cases had occurred
the vessel was released. In such cases complete reliance had to be placed
upon the Statutory Declarations, which were required from the Master and
the Senior Medical Officer. As a general rule these Declarations were to be
accepted as more or less reliable, inasmuch as there was power under the
Quarantine Act to require the production of any of the ship’s documents,
and particularly in the case of transports, the Hospital Admission Register
gave sufficient complete information to enable the Declarations to be checked.
There were, however, considerable difficulties, as, for example, in the case of
transports, from which wireless messages were received on the authority
of the Senior Medical Officer that no cases of influenza had occurred during the
voyage, whereas numerous cases had actually occurred. An illustration
of another difficulty was that in the case of another transport, on which the
Senior Medical Officer declared on arrival that there had been no case of
influenza, whereas there had been 95 cases during the voyage. If, as in the
case of transports, the vessel had to disembark passengers at various points


along the Australian coast, the passengers or troops for each port were landed
into the Quarantine Station for three days’ observation, and toe vessel
continued the voyage.
In the case of vessels on which there had been cases during the voyage,
the last of which had occurred within fourteen days prior to arrival at, or on
which there were cases on arrival at the first Australian port, the procedure
was as follows :
Vessels on which no case was present on arrival were detained for seven
days and if no further case occurred after procedure, as described above, then
the vessel was released, provision being made for the landing of passengers
and troops at ports along the Australian coast in. succession, as described
above.
In the event of a vessel arriving with cases actually on board, and still
occurring, the general practice was to detain the vessel at the first port until
the epidemic had been brought under control to an extent sufficient to permit
of the vessel proceeding on her voyage. The means adopted for this contro
were the immediate isolation of the sick as soon as the fact of sickness could
be ascertained; this measure, as in all infectious diseases, is deary t e
fundamental administrative measure and the most important which could
be adopted ; the ordinary quarantine practice of subdivision of contacts
exposed to infection into groups and sub-groups, according to their assessed
relative infection risk, and daily inspections for the early detection of invasion
stage cases. A daily thermometer parade, which was in some cases reinforced
by a second parade each day, with the immediate removal to an observation
hospital of any person showing a temperature of 99 degrees or over, was the
measure to which most importance was attached.
On vessels with cases still occurring on arrival and with the infection still
in an active condition, inoculation of contacts with Commonwealth vaccine
which has been described in Chapter VII., was immediately resorted to, at
first on the basis that good results had been claimed for the use of pneumococcal
vaccines for the prevention of infectious pneumonia m South Africa This was
in the beginning admittedly an experiment, but such good results followed the
application of this measure that in the absence of any indication to the contrary
it was considered highly desirable to proceed with this measure.
In the presence of a spreading epidemic the use of masks was enforced on
all the staff.
The isolation of patients at Quarantine Stations, and the precautions
taken by the staff against infection from the patients, were those which are
applied as matters of routine in any isolation hospital.
The discharge of convalescents after contact has been according to the
following rule The patient was kept in bed for five days after the tempera-
ture became normal, then transferred to the convalescent area for a further
seven days, after which he became eligible for release, the actual date ot
release varying according to individual condition and circumstances.


It was not at the outset considered that there was any evidence that
inanimate objects played any part in the spread of influenza, and accordingly
disinfection of these objects was considered to be unnecessary. This attitude
was maintained throughout, with an occasional exception, in the case of a
vessel with defective hygenic conditions in the living quarters, and a rapidly-
spreading epidemic, in which case disinfection of all parts of the vessel was
resorted to. There has never been any evidence that this omission to practice
routine disinfection has been attended with any risk.
With the decline of the epidemic in overseas countries, such as South Africa
and New Zealand, it has become possible to reduce the extent of the quarantine
restrictions. From 2nd January, 1919, the vessels from South Africa were not
detained for observation if clean on arrival and during the voyage, but were
only quarantined if there had been any case of influenza since leaving South
Africa. In the case of New Zealand, where cases continued to occur in a
severe form in various ports, this total removal of restrictions was not con-
sidered entirely advisable ; but from 17th April, 1919, vessels producing
a certificate of the responsible port health authority that they had been medi-
cally inspected before departure and found to be clean, and which gave
satisfactory evidence that there had been during the voyage from New Zealand
no influenza, were given pratique, and the passengers released under daily
surveillance for three successive days after landing, the crew being medically
inspected each day.
C. 5662.—2


CHAPTER III.
VESSELS UNINFECTED DURING THE VOYAGE.
As has been pointed out in the previous chapter, influenza was during
October, November, and December of 1918 prevalent in almost every country
in the form of a most disastrous epidemic.
The quarantine measures imposed on vessels arriving in Australia
included —
{a) Quarantine detention for observation of all vessels coming from
countries adjacent to Australia in which it was known that the
disease was prevalent in an especially severe form. This measure
was applied to vessels from South Africa, New Zealand, and the
South Sea Islands, and in the beginning to vessels from America.
While it was known that the disease was also prevalent in
Europe, America, and throughout Asia, East Indies, and the
Philippine Islands, vessels from these countries were not detained
for observation.
(6) Full quarantine of actually infected vessels until the vessel, without
personnel, could be freed or until the epidemic had been brought
under control.
Table A sets out the actual details for those vessels which were quarantined
for observation, but on which no case is known to have occurred during the
voyage or during the quarantine period.
This quarantine period was fixed at seven days, but in certain cases was
less. For example, vessels from certain of the Pacific Island groups, which
were reported as being not infected, were detained for three days only. In
the case of other vessels calling at an Australian port for coal, water, or stores,
the quarantine period was only sufficient to enable these functions to be dis
charged in quarantine, when the vessel proceeded on her voyage, the detention
being generally no more than one day.
The total numbers of vessels dealt with under these conditions between
17th October, 1918, and 30th April, 1919, were as follows
From New Zealand .. • ■ • • .. 97
„ South Africa .. . . • • .. 16
~ Pacific Islands .. • • .. 16
~ America .. • • • • .. 17
The total number of persons, including passengers and crew, which
were kept under observation under these conditions was 10,016.
In no single instance amongst these 150 ships, including 15,016 persons,
was there any indication of influenza, notwithstanding the most careful and
searching daily inspection.
The periods which had elapsed since these vessels left their last infected
port varied from 4 to 189 days, and the total periods, including the period of
quarantine for observation, varied from 7 to 193 days.


This result would seem to indicate that if a vessel from an oversea port
is free from influenza during the voyage and on arrival, there is no probability
that detention in quarantine for observation will cover any risk not covered
by measures applied to definitely infected vessels. This general rule would
seem to apply whether the duration of the voyage is ordinarily long, as in the
case of Capetown (17 to 31 days), or short, as in the case of Fiji or New Zealand,
viz., 5 to 18 days.
Such a general rule would be invalidated, if it could be shown that a case
of influenza had occurred during the quarantine period of any vessel on which
no case had occurred during the voyage. There were certain vessels on which
such an event appeared to occur.
These are shown in Table B.
It is seen from the table that there were only three such instances. Although
altogether a total of 228 vessels has been dealt with throughout the six months,
it is in itself a striking fact that only three such instances are recorded.
The facts concerning these vessels are given in the detailed statements
attached to the table.
These vessels are of very decided interest in many directions. They may
be taken as test cases affecting the validity—for this particular disease —
of the general principle that a vessel free from disease during the voyage
may be regarded as offering no risk and be given immediate pratique. This
is the principal aspect from the point of view of quarantine administration-.
There are other important epidemiological aspects which will presently be
indicated. -
One of the three instances, namely Atua (2), (No. 1*), may be dismissed
at once. In this case, although the surgeon reported on arrival that no case
of influenza had occurred during the voyage, on inquiry it was definitely
established from the evidence of the surgeon’s own diary that three cases had
occurred during the voyage of six days from Fiji. Epidemiologically, there-
fore,-dhis case does not affect the general principle above stated. Adminis-
tratively, it reveals that inherent weakness in quarantine administration,
familiar to all quarantine officers, the possibility of an ignorant or unscrupulous
ship’s surgeon making a false statement concerning the events of the voyage.
The number of cases on this ship was small, and the disease was limited in
its incidence to three passengers and the fourth engineer, who, quite probably,
came into frequent contact with passengers. No member of the ordinary
crew ratings was infected.
The cases of Atua (3), (No. 3), and H.M.A.S. Encounter (No. 2), may be
discussed together. In each instance the whole ship’s company was under
continuous observation by reliable and experienced surgeons. On Attm
there was Surgeon Temple Grey, who has been in control of the Samoan
Medical Relief Expedition sent down to Samoa to assist in controlling the
influenza epidemic there, and who, consequently, had had extensive recent
‘experience of the disease.
"’ : On each vessel one case was determined by the quarantine officers within
24: hours after entering quarantine. Two days later on Atua another member
: -!*-Ttie Jiumbere in parentheses refer to the serial nnmbeis in the tables appended to this and
‘Succeeding chapters.


of the crew was attacked, only the single case occurring on Encounter. The
length of the voyage from Fiji was seven days in each case. %
Here then were two vessels presenting some interesting features in
common.
On inquiry, however, it transpired that the Encounter case had reported
sick two days prior to arrival at Sydney, although the ship’s surgeon had
reported on arrival that there was no influenza on board. The surgeon had, in
fact, considered the case as one of septic throat. This was a genuine and
probably justifiable diagnosis, proved by the subsequent course of the case
to be open to question. The course of this case was such that it must remain
doubtful whether the case was really influenza, and, in any event, the presence
of the declared case on board does not permit of this vessel being considered
an exception to the general principle now under consideration, especially as
this case would have been considered sufficient for the detention of the vessel
in any event.
Atua (3), (No. 3), presents more difficult features. All on board were
inoculated whilst at sea, the inoculation being performed on 3rd February
(four days after leaving Suva and three days before arrival at Sydney). There
is no traceable connexion between the two cases which occurred, one being
a fireman who lived in the forecastle, and the other a steward who lived in a
cabin aft, and no spread of the disease took place beyond these two cases.
The significance of these two cases must remain a matter for speculation.
The fireman proved to be a case of acute miliary tuberculosis, and the
steward’s attack proved to be an extremely mild febrile attack, with some
pharyngitis. The possibility of one or more mild missed cases having
occurred on board must also be mentioned.
It is, however, not possible to completely explain this vessel. It remains
as the single exception over a period of six months to the general principle
that, if a vessel has had no cases during the voyage up to the moment of arrival,
whether that voyage be 4 days or 189 days, or anything between, then
the vessel may, without risk, be given pratique without quarantine detention,
provided, however, that the declarations of Masters and surgeons that no such
case had occurred may be accepted, and that the diagnosis of the surgeon
of any doubtful case can also be accepted.* In a disease, such as influenza,
the differential diagnosis of .which may embrace the whole range of clinical
medicine, it is especially difficult to rely upon a single statement of this
kind.
There is, however, one direction in which these vessels are of importance
in connexion with quarantine administration. All quarantine methods are
admittedly restricted in their value by the necessity for relying upon declara-
tions from the ship’s staff concerning events during the voyage. Admitting
this necessity, the significance of the vessels now under discussion may,
in the light of the experience recorded under Tables A and C, be conceded to
be of somewhat less importance than appears when these are considered alone.
Atua (3) is the only instance which offers a reliable exception to the general
principle. In this case there was no appearance of the disease until nine days
after leaving the last source of infection, and there was no spread beyond the
two cases. There is somewhat more than a reasonable doubt whether
cases were genuinely influenza of the infectious kind. “ Influenza ” is

admittedly a term which is clinically applicable to many cases which show no
evidence of infectivity, and is, in practice, applied in times of epidemics to
cases which would ordinarily be considered as merely transient febrile attacks
of obscure origin.
There does not, at this present stage, after six months of extensive experi-
ence, appear to be any fact invalidating the general principle that any vessel
arriving in port after at least four days’ journey, without any case of identifiable
influenza having occurred during the voyage, will not develop, within a period
of seven further days’ detention in quarantine for observation, any primary
case of influenza, and that the admission of such vessel to immediate pratique
will not offer any risk to the community ; provided that any case of sickness
on board at the moment of arrival, which presents any doubtful aspect, be
considered as reason for detaining the vessel until all doubt is removed. The
provision of a further period of surveillance of passengers and crew may be
considered as advisable, but, with the single exception of Atua (3), (No. 3),
there has been nothing in our six months’ experience to suggest the necessity
for this. This added precaution, however, with the object of establishing
the diagnosis in such cases as those which occurred on Atua (3), may be
considered advisable.
At a later stage reference will be again made to this aspect, after the
natural history of influenza on vessels at sea has been studied, and after
discussion of the question whether influenza infection did escape the quarantine
barriers. Such a discussion would necessitate a consideration of what further
quarantine measures might be necessary, and the extent to which such measures
might be practicable.

CHAPTER IV.
VESSELS INFECTED DURING THE VOYAGE.
Part I. —Oversea Vessels.
The conditions on a ship at sea offer an almost ideal opportunity for
studying the natural history of any infectious disease. The conditions
could be considerably improved if, on each vessel on which any extensive
epidemic occurred, there was a surgeon experienced in the science of epidemi-
ology who could observe and record the events from day to day. Fortunately,
during the experience of the past six months, the Commonwealth Quarantine
Service has had to deal with a large number of vessels under varying con-
ditions, and included amongst such vessels there has been a considerable
number of transports carrying soldiers under control, and medical officers
whose instructions obliged them to record events from day to day. These
records have been frequently found to be not entirely accurate, but there is
in them a large amount of very useful material. Upon these records, and from
the experience of the Quarantine Service, the following discussion is based.
The relationship between the progress of an epidemic in any country
and the numbers of vessels from that country appears to be very close.
Vessels which arrived in Australia, having been infected during their voyage,
received their infection in England, Egypt, India, Java, Japan, America,
South Africa, Fiji, and New Zealand. The course of the epidemic in those
countries, for which the information is available, is shown in weekly periods
in Graph A, which shows also the periods during which infected vessels bound
for Australia left those countries.
It is obvious at once that the frequency of infection of vessels follows
closely the degree of epidemic prevalence in the country of origin. This
comparison could not be entirely exact, unless it took also into account the
relative proportion of infected vessels as compared with the total number
leaving, but it is only possible to show this proportion for New Zealand
and Fiji, and unfortunately records were not kept in those countries
sufficiently completely to enable the weekly incidence of cases or deaths
to be recorded.
It may be expressed that the probability of departing vessels receiving
infection in any country is proportionate to the degree of prevalence of the
disease in that country. That is, of course, mere commonplace of fact, and
it would not appear that any advantage arises from having it expressed.
In administrative practice, however, it has important bearings.
The rapidity of cable communication, and extensive publicity which a
widely-circulated daily press insures, result in the public haying full knowledge
that a disastrous epidemic is prevalent in South Africa, whereas vessels,
taking twenty or more days to reach Australia, which left South Africa before
the epidemic had passed beyond its early invasion phases, and while the
probability of exportation was still so low as to be almost negligible, are still
on the water. This leads possibly to a panic attitude on the part of the
public, which may render intelligent administration difficult. The remedy
for such a difficulty is early, constant, and honest communication between
countries, giving warning of trouble.

GRAPH A.—EXPORTATION INCIDENCE OF INFECTED VESSELS.
EXPLANATORY NOTE. — In each case the numbers below the line represent actual numbers of
infected vessels departing during each week shown. Where dotted lines are shown (except in the
case of United States) the graph is not accurate, but has been constrncted as nearly as possible
from available data. In the graph showing the course of the epidemic in United States the broKen
line gives the actual course of the death-rate in San Francisco.


The proportion of vessels in which the first cases developed amongst
crew, troops, or civilian passengers may be expressed as follows :■ —

Similarly, when the epidemic, is waning in a country in which it has been
prevalent enough to have merited extensive press comment, there may be
public opposition to any relaxation of measures based upon the established
and obvious fact above stated.
This general law of probability of exportation appears to be quite indepen-
dent of any administrative control of departing persons or vessels, as it is seen
constantly in countries where no attempt at such control is made.
It will be shown in another chapter that the same conditions have operated
in respect of sea traffic between the various Australian States.
There is another important aspect. The press-informed public are apt
to demand extreme measures against infected countries, and to insist upon the
continuance of such measures so long as there are cases reported in those
countries. The facts appear to establish a general rule that, whilst the
percentage incidence of an infectious disease in an overseas country is below
a certain undefined level, the probability of infection escaping from that country
by sea routes becomes so small that special measures—other than those
prescribed by routine in such a quarantine system as that in use in the Common-
wealth-become unnecessary. This appears to harmonize in principle with
Ross’ law relating to epidemicity of malaria.
Onset of Ship Epidemics.
A very constant fact in the infected ships dealt with by the Commonwealth
Quarantine Service during the past six months has been the early onset of the
ship epidemic after leaving the infected port.
In every case in which reliable details are available, the first cases developed
within three days after leaving an infected port. There were, in fact, only
two instances in which the first cases developed on the third day, viz.,
Gracchus (No. 22) and Niagara (No. 4).
The “ third day ” may mean anything from 49 to 72 hours, or may even
mean something less than 48 hours.
All the other vessels, including Boonah (No. 38) and Medic (No. 10), were
specified as being in this respect within the second day.
The practical value of this fact lies obviously in the light it throws on the
incubation period of the disease, under conditions which exclude many
possibilities of error. These facts appear to establish the incubation period
for these vessels as not more than three days.


Duration and Epidemic Course of Ship Epidemics.
In discussing the duration of an epidemic on shipboard, there are certain
disturbing factors :
(a) The vessel may call at various way-ports, landing sick at each port
of call. This, as will presently be discussed, might be presumed
to act, by removing sources of infection, in the direction
of abbreviating the course of the epidemic.
( b) The population on the vessel, the form and amount of accommo-
dation provided, the relative distribution of numbers of crew
and passengers, all may act as disturbing factors.
It will, perhaps, be best to discuss this phase in a defined order of sequence,
taking first small cargo steamers, then passenger ships, and finally troopships.
Kaituna (No. 14), with a crew of 29 and no passengers. First case reported
30th October ; the second crop was on 2nd November, when eight
men reported sick. On 3rd November the vessel reached Westport
(N.Z.) and stayed there, all hands being ordered on shore to sleep
on the night of 4th November. On 7th November eight men
reported sick, and on Bth November a further case occurred. No
other case was reported, although the vessel was moving freely
between New Zealand ports. Two distinct epidemics occurred on
this vessel, the second probably being a fresh infection. Four days
covered the first epidemic and two days the second.
Waihora (No. 27), with a crew of 47, left Calcutta on 4th February. The
first case developed within 24 hours of sailing, i.e., on sth February.
Thereafter cases occurred as follows : sth (a second case), Bth, 9th,
11th, 13th, 14th, 17th, one case each. Eight cases out of a crew of
46, and all occurred within a fortnight. The disease in this case
was of a mild type, and showed itself as a steady spread from one
person to another with no explosive tendencies.
Waimarino (No. 19), with a crew of 43, left Vancouver on 25th January.
On 27th January the first cases occurred, thereafter a chain of twelve
cases occurred which was completed, leaving 21 persons uninfected
by 4th March or at some earlier date. Approximately five weeks
was the period of the epidemic.
Tarawera (No. 28), with a crew of 34, and no passengers, left Auckland
on 24th October. On that date the chief steward developed influenza.
Thereafter, six further cases occurred, being one cook, two stewards,
an engineer, two firemen. The epidemic was complete within eight
days, and was limited in extent.
Niagara (No. 4) left Vancouver on 24th September with 313 passengers
and 254 crew. The first case occurred 27th September. The exact
course of the epidemic cannot now be traced, but by 9th October there
were 70 cases, and on 12th October there were 103 cases, and by
21st October the epidemic may be said to have been over. Pas-
sengers and crew were under observation until Ist November,
without any recrudescence of the epidemic. Apart from the initial


case, the epidemic commenced on 2nd October and was complete
by 21st October, with nearly 400 out of a total complement of 567
uninfected. A period of three weeks covered the epidemic.
Atua (1), (No. 7), left Auckland 2nd November with 77 crew and 86
passengers. The day after leaving Auckland, i.e., on 3rd November,
cases began to occur, and 62 had declared themselves on Bth Novem-
ber. Thereafter the epidemic was as follows : —9th November
(5 cases), 10th (8), 11th (7), 12th (4), 13th (2), 14th (1), 15th (1),
22nd (1). The case on the 22nd might reasonably be excluded,
as constant contact with shore staff at the Quarantine Station was
necessarily occurring. The whole epidemic was over in twelve days,
leaving almost half the ship's company uninfected.
Manuka (No. 9) left Wellington 7th November with 95 crew and 108
passengers. Although the exact date of the first case in this vessel
is not known, it must have been between 7th and 10th November.
Taking the earlier date, the actual date of departure from Wellington,
7th November, the epidemic was complete by 19th November, or
thirteen days.
Medic (No. 10), an Australian transport, with 156 crew and 833 passengers.
The passengers included 829 troops and 4 civilians. The first cases
occurred 11th November, and thereafter the course was as follows :

The epidemic in this case was not complete until it had lasted
for 40 days, although the principal part of the epidemic was complete
within fourteen days. There were attacked 313 persons out of 989,
leaving 676 persons uninfected.
Boonah (No. 38). This vessel left Durban on 24th November with
164 crew and 931 troops. Several mild cases occurred, but the
epidemic was first definitely recognised on 29th November, from
which date the records begin. The course of the epidemic up till
the time of arrival at Fremantle is seen by the graph on page 35.

The epidemic lasted altogether from 29th November to 7th
January, attacking a total of 470 cases out of a ship s company
of 1,095. The construction of the vessel was such that it cannot be
said that there was any isolation between various sections of the
ship’s company.
Mataram (No. 31) left Singapore on 9th October with 98 crew and 100
passengers. The epidemic commenced amongst the Malay crew
on 10th October with three cases, two more occurring next day.
Between then and 14th October, the disease rapidly spread in the
crew’s quarters. On 14th October the (Indian) engine-room staff
were attacked. On 18th October the vessel arrived at Darwin,
59 cases having occurred within eight days. Thereafter only two
cases occurred, the dates of onset not being available, but they were
certainly before Ist November. The whole epidemic in this case
was complete within three weeks.
Devon (No. 40) commenced her voyage at Port Said, where troops were
embarked. The following were ports called at

The ship’s personnel was distributed as follow : —Crew, 110 ;
first-class passengers, 62; second class, 280; third class, 640;
others, 4 ; or a total of 986 passengers. There were 81 cases amongst
920 troops, or 8- 8 per cent., and 14 cases amongst 110 crew, or 12 per
cent. There is no record of any case amongst the passengers.
In this case the epidemic lasted for 24 days, but it had exhausted
its principal effect within seventeen days.
Demosthenes (No. 61) left England on 15th January, 1919, with 179 crew
and 1,489 passengers (troops). On 17th January a case of mild
influenza was admitted to hospital. On 20th January four cases
were admitted, on 21sb (2), 23rd (1), 25th (2), 28th (1), 30th (1).
This was a small epidemic of a mild type, complete within fourteen
days, amounting to twelve cases amongst 1,489 troops.
Marathon (No. 43), carrying troops from England, had on board 920
troops and 121 crew.

Embarkation was completed at Devonport on 20th October; at
that time there was an outbreak of influenza amongst the ship’s
crew and, as a result, sailing was postponed until 7th November.
During the delay influenza broke out amongst the military personnel.
It is probable that infection, already on the ship, was also reintro-
duced by the troops embarked. During period 20th October to

After Ist November there were no further cases. The Senior
Medical Officer reports that—As soon as the outbreak manifested
itself, vigorous preventative treatment was instituted, main reliance
being placed on naso-pharyngeal disinfection, carried on by means
of inhalation of 1 per cent, formaldehyde solution, atomized by
steam from pipe connected with engine-room. For the first week,
the personnel were paraded for spraying twice daily, thence to
Capetown once daily, weather permitting. After departure from
Capetown, all ranks were sprayed for seven days. It is considered
that this method of prevention of infection has proved effective."
In support of this opinion, the Senior Medical Officer refers to the table of
admissions, showing that the cases fell immediately after the spraying
commenced.
Range of Infection.
This may be discussed from two points of view (a) the percentage rate
of attack upon various groups of persons on board various ships, (h) the extent
to which an epidemic invading first one department of a ship was limited to
that department.
(a) Percentage Incidence Rate.
The following table shows the attack rate on the total personnel of various
ships
These percentages range from 10 per cent, to 17 per cent, on small cargo
vessels, and from 8 per cent, to 30 per cent, on troopships, and 62 per cent,
on a naval man-of-war.


(b) Limitation to Departments.
The Senior Medical Officer on Boonah (No. 38) —Dr. Clouston —has recorded
an interesting fact for that vessel, which shows the uniformity of distribution
of cases under the conditions existing on a troopship :
On the Boonah there was only one troop deck. The troops on the ship
were gathered from four Military Districts in Australia, in the following-
proportions of the total
Victoria. South Australia. New South Wales. Western Australia.
40 per cent. .. 22 per cent. .. 19 per cent. .. 19 per cent.
The percentages of the total influenza cases amongst troops were —
Victoria. South Australia. New South Wales. Western Australia.
43 per cent. .. 23 per cent. .. 18 per cent. .. 16 per cent.
The similarity of the two sets of figures showing the uniformity of distri-
bution of infection amongst the troops.”
By contrast, however, the distribution of the cases amongst troops and
crew was unequal. Amongst a crew of 164 there were 37 cases, or 22 per cent.,
and amongst 931 troops, in which section of the ship’s company the first case
occurred, there were 433 cases, or 46 per cent. On a vessel such as Boonah,
it can hardly be said that any difference in living conditions accounted for this
disparity.
The following instances will show the available information regarding
distribution of infection on a mixed ship :
Mataram (No. 31), with a crew of 98 and 100 passengers, was first attacked

per cent., were attacked
GRAPH B. —“DEVON.” DAILY INCIDENCE OF CASES.
The course of the disease on such vessels as the Waimarino, Mataram ,
Niagara, and Kaituna is of interest.
On Kaituna (No. 14) the disease was confined to the A.B. s the clnet
officer, and the captain, the engineer’s department not being affected.
On Niagara (No. 4) the spread of the disease first to the two stewards,
who slept in the same quarters as the original case, then to seven men in the
same peak, thence to other stewards, and through them to the sailors forward,
finally attacking the firemen, indicates a definite course along a well-defined
line of personal contact.


On Waimarino (No. 19) the first two cases were the boatswain and the
carpenter, occupying the same cabin. The next cases were sailors, with whom
these two came into contact to a greater extent than with the firemen, and the
four sailors attacked occupied the four foremost bunks. From thence onwards
the distribution, amongst the total ship’s company of 43, was haphazard.
On Mataram (No. 31) the Malay crew were first attacked, and the disease
did not spread beyond this group until it had established itself well amongst
these.
The results appear to establish that the behaviour of influenza on vessels
on which serious epidemics occur follows a fairly constant course according
to circumstances. Where there is a differentiation into separated departments,
and where passengers and crew, or different sections of the crew, are more
or less separated, the spread from section to section will correspond with the
degree of such separation.
On Kaituna (No. 14) the infection did not spread beyond the deck depart-
ment, although the whole ship’s company was only 29 in number.
On Waimarino (No. 19) it was slow in spreading beyond the deck
department.
On Mataram, Niagara, Makura, the definite disproportion between
numbers of crew and passengers attacked is very striking. On the other
hand, on troopships such as Boonah and Medic, where there is such a large
number of troops that differentiation between troops and crew is hardly
practicable, the troops and crew became attacked in more equal proportion.
In making the above comparisons, only well-defined outbreaks on those
vessels for which reliable details are available have been taken. The evidence
appears to justify the general statement that there is nothing mysterious in
the method of spread of this disease, that there is no air convection, that there
is no ill-defined carrier condition, but that the spread depends upon personal
contact, and that such contact must be at close range, i.e., within such small
distance as would be represented by adjacent sleeping bunks in a forecastle.
Control of Ship Epidemics.
From the administrative stand-point, the most important aspect of these
ship epidemics is the evidence they offer towards the suggestion of a method
of control. For this purpose there were certain measures utilized, and there
are also certain natural factors which may have played some part. These
may be stated as follow :
(a) Use of inhalation chambers in which steam impregnated with a
1-2 per cent, solution of zinc sulphate is used.
( b ) Use of inoculation by a mixed vaccine.
(c) Isolation of the sick at as early a stage as possible.
( d ) A (hypothetical) natural decline in the virulence or infectivity
of the infecting organism.
(e) An (hypothetical) exhaustion of susceptible material on the
vessel.
An outbreak of infectious disease on a ship at sea offers the most favorable
naturally occurring conditions for the study of the natural history of that
disease. There can be, if the epidemic is at all extensive, no effective


isolation ; there can be no new factor introduced from outside, and therefore
the epidemic can pursue its unadulterated course, and there is reasonable
accuracy in the records, though these unfortunately frequently lack the
necessary detail.
For the study of the factors of control there is available certain definite
material.
The course of the epidemics on Mataram, Niagara, Medic, Boonah, Devon,
Sardinia, Marathon, Atua, and Manuka is known fairly well for the present
purposes.
Inhalation. —On Mataram effective isolation was not possible, and no sick
were removed from the vessel. From the time of leaving Darwin the nose
and naso-pharynx of every person on board was hand-sprayed every day,
and only a further two cases developed.
On Medic inhalation by the zinc sulphate method was not commenced
until 3rd December, by which time the epidemic was almost over.
On Boonah all troops were put through the inhalation chamber on board
each day from the time of leaving Durban until arrival at Fremantle. This
was an excellent test case for comparison with Medic, as the epidemics
occurred under similar conditions. Both ships carried Australian troops
who had not been out of Australia on service, but had only commenced their
voyage when the armistice was signed, both occurred at the same time, in the
same latitudes, and each had approximately the same number of troops.
The only difference was the source of infection, Boonah being infected in
South Africa, Medic in New Zealand.
Although inhalation was done in one case thoroughly, and in the othei
case not at all, the course of the epidemic in each case is strikingly similar, each
case taking six days to rise from zero to maximum and then falling away
rapidly. The only appreciable difference between the curves is that Boonah
epidemic was slightly slower in recovering to zero than Medic, taking eleven
days against five days in the case of Medic in spite of the daily inhalation.
The Senior Medical Officer of the Marathon claims that inhalation daily
with formalin instead of zinc sulphate was definitely effective in cutting short
the epidemic on this vessel. The course of the epidemic in this case was
different from either Boonah or Medic, showing a gradual rise and an abrupt
fall.
Even in the face of this claim, however, the comparison between Boonah
and Medic is sufficient to establish the fact that inhalation with zinc sulphate
is, by itself, of no value for the control of an epidemic in full swing. It was
never designed for this purpose, and its value in dealing with possible carriers
amongst recovered cases cannot be decided upon these instances.
Inoculation.— There are only two instances in which preventive inoculation
was resorted to in the presence of a fully declared epidemic on board ship.
These were the two already quoted, viz., Medic and Boonah.
On Medic inoculation of troops was done on 21st November, and on Boonah.
on 12th December. In the case of Medic inoculation was carried out on the
day the maximum number of cases occurred, while on Boonah it could not be
done until the crest of the curve was well passed. In each case there was a
sudden decline to zero in the graphs, the angle of decline after inoculation


being approximately the same in each instance. The course of the two
curves suggests that had inoculation been carried out on Boonah at the same
stage as it was carried out on Medic, there would have been no lag in Boonah
curve as compared with Medic, but both would have fallen at the same rate.
To accept this hypothesis, however, would mean disregarding other possible
factors.
It may incidentally be noted at this juncture that these two cases appear
to offer conclusive argument against the “ negative phase ” which has, in some
quarters, been presumed to exist.
The cases of Lancashire and Nestor are worth consideration as to the
possibility of a delayed epidemic course resulting from inoculation. In each
of these vessels there had been general inoculation of troops before leaving
England ;in each there was a succession of mild cases of one-day catarrhal
fever,” “ pyrexia of unknown origin,” and similar febrile conditions. The
epidemic course was irregular and prolonged, exhibiting nothing of the sharp
well-defined rise to a critical maximum, with an almost equally sudden fall
to normal. Regarding only inoculation, it might appear that this had played
an important part in reducing the clinical severity and explosive infectivity
of influenza, but before it can be decided whether inoculation exercised any
influence in terminating the epidemic on these or on any of the ships in-
question, the other possible factors must be considered.
Exhaustion of Susceptible Material. —ln the case of vessels, such as Niagara
(No. i) and Atua (1) (No. 7), there is no ground for any positive statement
as to any hypothetical exhaustion of susceptible material, but in the two
cases of Medic and Boonah there is sufficient ground for quite definite assertion.
These vessels left Australia in October, proceeded on their journey with troops,
and, being instructed to return on account of the cessation of hostilities,
left New Zealand and South Africa respectively, returning to Australia,
having received infection from those countries. In each case a considerable
proportion of the troops was infected, but the majority escaped. The per-
centage distribution of the cases on Boonah, when grouped according to
States of enlistment, corresponds remarkably closely with the percentage
distribution of total persons from each State as a proportion of the total
soldiers on the ship’s company. Had there been any natural insusceptibility,
or had any previous influenza epidemic produced any artificial immunity,
it is highly improbable that the percentage of cases amongst troops would
have approximated in the two vessels, or that the distribution on Boonah
amongst men coming from four States would have been so remarkably
uniform.
It must be concluded that, in the two principal ship epidemics with which
the quarantine service had to deal, exhaustion of susceptible material played
no part in bringing the epidemic to a close. The conclusion is further supported
by the subsequent history of Boonah, on which occasional cases continued to
occur for some 22 days after arrival at Fremantle, and after the epidemic
curve had fallen almost to a daily zero.
There remain for consideration two factors, early isolation of the sick
and a hypothetical natural decline in the virulence or infectivity of the
infecting organism. These must be considered together. Illustrative examples
may be quoted.


Marathon (No. 43) experienced an epidemic of 89 cases, which ran its
course while the vessel was still in port. Concerning this vessel,
the Senior Medical Officer stated that initial isolation was attempted,
but the hospital accommodation being quite inadequate, a portion
of the troop deck had to be used for cases, and through this men had
to pass to get to their quarters. It was also stated that there was
some evidence towards the close of the epidemic of a decline in
virulence. In this case the conclusions are slightly affected by the
claim that formalin inhalation was sufficient by itself to terminate
the epidemic. At least it may be said that isolation of the cases
played no part in producing this result.
Sardinia (No. 42) experienced an epidemic of 120 cases. Concerning
isolation the Senior Medical Officer records—“ Hospital accommoda-
tion was soon overtaxed and great difficulty was experienced in
dealing with cases. Recourse was had to placing a number of cases
on the poop.”
In this vessel, with 1,181 troops, there were only 120 cases, with eight
deaths —a mortality rate of 6.6 per cent.—which is not below that seen on
vessels with more extensive outbreaks.
In this case there was a definitely limited outbreak, in which neither
inoculation, inhalation, or early isolation of cases played any part. There is
no evidence concerning possible exhaustion of susceptible material, and there
is no collateral evidence of any clinical indication of decline in virulence.
The most probable interpretation in this instance is that the epidemic was
self-limited, ceasing because of a decline in infectivity of the infecting agent,
although, as the troops had just left England, where influenza had been very
prevalent, the possibility of a large percentage having recently had attacks
of influenza must be borne in mind.
On Mataram (No. 31), effective isolation was not possible, and no sick
were removed from the vessel. In spite of this, less than one-third
of the ship’s company was attacked. There is in this case the
complicating factor of daily treatment, which has been above
discussed. The exhaustion of susceptible material cannot in this
case be entirely excluded, as the vessel left Singapore when the
epidemic was still vigorous, and it is known that many of the crew
had just recovered from the disease. (None of the newly-shipped
men contracted it, and none of the Greek steerage passengers—
all had had it.)
The above are instances of vessels in which the epidemic completed itself
without the removal of any sick. The following are cases in which the sick
were removed at some stage in the epidemic.
Niagara (No. 4). —This epidemic began on 2nd October and lasted twenty
days, with a total of 155 cases. Isolation of cases on board was out
of the question, and removal of the cases was only commenced on
arrival at Auckland on 12th October, i.e., the eleventh day of the
epidemic. Between 2nd and 12th October there were 110 cases,
between 12th and 21st October there were 45 cases. In this instance
isolation cannot be said to have been complete at any stage, as some


cases were not removed at Auckland. It may be accepted that many
cases representing potential or actual sources of infection remained
on the ship throughout, so that the termination of the epidemic,
which began under conditions apparently very favorable for rapid
spread, was not due to either inhalation, inoculation, or early
isolation of the sick.
On Niagara the epidemic was complete before the vessel arrived at a
Quarantine Station in Australia. In the succeeding cases the vessels arrived
at the station in the height of the epidemic.
Atua (1) (No. 7). —Onset of the epidemic was on 4th November, and out
of a total company of 163, 88 cases occurred, of whom 16 died,
a fatality rate of 18 per cent., which was the highest met with on any
vessel. The epidemic was complete by 15th November, or twelve
days. In this case, immediately on arrival on Bth November,
every person was removed to the shore, with the exception of a small
anchor watch. Absolute isolation of the sick from the well was
carried out, and cases were removed from amongst the healthy the
moment they occurred. There could be no better test of the value
of early isolation of the sick as a controlling factor. The result was
as follows :
Before isolation 59 cases, or 67 per cent., had occurred.
After isolation 29 cases, or 32 per cent., occurred.
If the period of incubation be adopted for the present purpose as
48 hours, then 10th November must be taken as the date on which
all cases incubating at the time of landing had declared themselves.
There were 75 cases, or 85 per cent., on or before 10th November,
and 13 cases, or 15 per cent., after that date.
In the case of Niagara, if the date of the arrival at Auckland be taken,
on which date some of the cases were removed, but isolation was by no means
completely carried out, it is found that 70 per cent, occurred before that date
and 30 per cent, afterwards, figures less significant than those on Atua.
Or, if the two cases be contrasted in another way, namely, by taking the
middle day of the epidemic period—the llth-12th in the case of Niagara, and
9th-10th in the case of Atua —it is found that in the former case 70 per cent,
of the cases occurred on or before the 11th November, and in the latter 73 per
cent, occurred on or before the 9th November.
There does not appear to be any very marked difference between the
course of the epidemic in the two cases. The extreme virulence of the infection
on Atua must be taken into account, as a reduction in incidence in the case
of such a virulent agent would need to be considered strong presumptive
evidence in favour of the activity of any related causal factor. No such
reduction in virulence occurred.
In the case of Manuka, in which there was an epidemic comprising 42
cases, of which three may be discarded for the present purpose, the sick were
not removed from the vessel until the eighth day after the epidemic began.
Thereafter the epidemic ceased in four days. Of the 39 cases, 29 occurred
before isolation and 10 after, i.e., 75 per cent, before isolation and 25 per cent,
afterwards ; or taking the middle day in this case, i.e., 13th to 14th November,


23 cases occurred on or before 13th November and 16 cases afterwards, or
59 per cent, before and 41 per cent, after the median date. This would, by-
contrast with Atua, appear to suggest that immediate removal of cases is of
advantage in reducing the numbers of cases in the latter half of the course of
the epidemic.
Medic (No. 10).- —Epidemic began on 11th November, and was not com-
plete for 40 days. Isolation of cases by removal to shore began
on 21st November, and was not completed until 27th November ;
cases thereafter being removed from the ship as they occurred,
detection being immediate after onset. The isolation date must be
fixed as being at the close of 27th November, before which date
293 cases were removed and 20 thereafter. In this case, 299 cases
occurred before the median date, 14 cases occurring afterwards.
t q - Boonah (No. 36). —In this case landing of patients began on 11th Decem-
ber, or twelve days after the first cases ; immediately thereafter the
numbers of cases fell rapidly, taking, however, eight days to reach
zero. In this instance, a less number of days were taken in landing
sick than were required in the case of the Medic.
The course of events in the two vessels may be compared as follows :
Medic— Landing commenced on sixth day of epidemic at highest point
of epidemic curve ; but though isolation of cases was carried out
completely after 27th November, cases continued to occur up to
20th December.
Boonah. —Landing commenced on twelfth day of epidemic, at least five
days after the maximum point of the curve, when the curve was
already definitely showing a declining tendency, thereafter cases
fell to zero in eight days, but continued to occur for a further
eighteen days.
In these cases there was still left a considerable majority of troops
on board unaffected. On Medic, out of 829 troops there was still
81 per cent, uninfected ; on Boonah, out of 931 troops, there was still
46 per cent, uninfected.
The subsequent course on Boonah is suggestive. After reaching zero,
and after persistent removal of cases as soon as possible after they occurred,
there was still a continued occurrence of cases, resulting in a total of 38 cases.
Between Albany and Adelaide there was no possibility of landing cases, but
these were carefully isolated on board as they occurred.
So far as these two vessels are concerned, there is no evidence that early
removal of the cases as they occurred affected the earlier course of the epidemic,
as the maximum of incidence had already been reached or passed when removal
or isolation was complete. There is, moreover, no important difference in the
latter portions of the curve, and the persistence of the epidemic in minor
degree on both Medic and Boonah, after removal of the majority of the cases,
would seem to suggest a survival of infectivity not kept entirely in control
by removal of cases.
Light might be thrown on this aspect if there were available an instance
in which the isolation commenced during the earlier part of the epidemic,
when the curve was on the ascent. Such a case will be discussed under


Table D (p. 50). The Medic, however, provides evidence in another direction.
Amongst the Italians on this vessel there was a sullen passivity. The sick
amongst them refused to report to the doctor and remained amongst their
companions. This resulted in 62 per cent, amongst them falling sick, which
was the highest percentage incidence seen in this series of vessels.

A indicates date of inoculation. B indicates days of removal of cases to shore.
GRAPH D.—“BOONAH.” DAILY INCIDENCE OF CASES.

Amongst vessels on which isolation on board was impossible, and which
could not land cases at any port, the most striking instance was Sardinia,
on which there was every opportunity for spread, but on which an infection
capable of producing a 6.6 per cent, mortality rate was limited, without
any control measures, to 120 cases. In this case the possibility of a large
percentage of immunes cannot be overlooked.
The history of the epidemic on these vessels must be read in comparison
with the history in the case of the vessels which left England at a later date,
when the epidemic in that country was subsiding.
Ulysses (No. 63), left England on 17th January, and throughout the
voyage from England had had a series of 90 cases of influenza. In
spite of all the measures of isolation which were adopted, the vessel
continued to have a succession of cases, not only up to the moment
of arrival in Australia, but also throughout the continued journey
along the coast of Australia, during the whole of which it was under
the control and supervision of the Commonwealth Quarantine
Service.
Ceramic (No. 65), Lancashire (No. 66), Orca (No. 70), and Kashmir (No. 76)
all showed similar histories. The graph showing the course of the
cases on Ceramic until arrival in Australia is reproduced here, and
shows a picture quite different from that on Boonah or Medic. The
disease evidently during the months of January, February, March,
1919, was exhibiting characteristics different from those seen during
October, November, and December, 1918. The principal differ-
ences are a less severity in the individual attack indicated by a greater
proportion of “ catarrh,” “pyrexia of unknown origin,” “ coryza,”
“ bronchial catarrh,” and a less dramatic epidemic course. The
initial phases of the epidemic invasion appear to be similar, but the
infecting agent appears to persist longer and to continue in an
indefinite way in spite of attempts at control.
GRAPH E.—“CERAMIC.” DAILY INCIDENCE OF CASES.
The only two extensive outbreaks on shipboard with which the Quarantine
Service had to deal were Boonah and Medic. These were infected in the
country of departure at the height of the epidemic in that country. Other


epidemics on shipboard infected on vessels at a greater distance, but with an
equal severity in individual attack had exhausted themselves before arrival in
Australia. It appears reasonable on the evidence so far available to conclude
that epidemics on shipboard will, if the vessel leaves the infected country
at the height of the epidemic, exhibit a correspondingly severe attack, which
runs a definite course, exhausting its severity and infectivity in a short period,
leaving a majority of the ship population at risk unattacked ; that as succes-
sive vessels leave the infected country in the declining phases of the epidemic
the type of ship epidemic will become modified, the severity of the individual
attack lessening until a large proportion of atypical mild attacks is seen,
and the course of the epidemic becoming less well defined and more prolonged;
that pari passu with the declining phases of the epidemic in the country
of departure, the number of infected ships from that country will decrease
until a certain, as yet undefined, level of incidence in the country of origin is
reached, when no infected ships are likely to leave that country.
It appears on the evidence available from this series of vessels that the
tendency of ship epidemics is to follow a definite and uniform course indepen-
dently of any measures of control (inhalation, inoculation, or isolation) as yet
designed, although isolation properly carried out may have some appreciable
effect of a minor kind. This question will be further discussed when the more
complete experience gained in respect of vessels in the Australian coastal
service has been discussed.
It must be obvious that as all measures of control of epidemics have been
proved to be valueless in affecting the main course of the epidemic, the
application of quarantine to vessels where the whole ship population at risk
can be detained, till the infecting agent has completed its course, is the most
important means of protecting any country exposed to infection ; and more-
over, that unless the essential condition, viz., the control of the whole popu-
lation at risk can be assured, incomplete attempts at quarantine detention,
such as might be attempted at land borders, are entirely futile.
The position on the available evidence may be summarized as follows :
Amongst ships carrying troops from Europe there was, during the height
of the European epidemic, a distinct tendency to limitation of epidemics
with a characteristic epidemic curve, which, as the European epidemic
declined, showed a much more irregular course. This applies also to other
oversea vessels.
Amongst ships carrying persons exposed to the severe type of infection
prevalent in South Africa and New Zealand, there was a severe incidence,
a regular initial epidemic curve, and a more or less sudden termination
of the main epidemic, followed by a scattered and irregular succession of
cases.
Of the measures adopted, inhalation may be dismissed as a primary
controlling factor, exhaustion of susceptible material cannot be recognised
as being of importance, inoculation appears on the evidence here available
as having a possible influence ; but on other external evidence, it is known
that it does not exercise any controlling influence of a primary kind — such
as small-pox vaccine—on the course of the epidemic.

This may, however, in the light of fuller information, be qualified in
respect of the nature of the infective virus, as it is not entirely beyond question
that one phase of a dual infection may be modified by a vaccine of the type
used sufficiently to modify the course of the epidemic.
The evidence given above seems to indicate that the progress of an epidemic
on board ship, when the ship’s personnel consisted of persons not immune to
that virulent form of infection prevalent in South Africa and New Zealand,
was a rise and fall mainly determined by a natural evolution of the infecting
agent, but that the course of the epidemic might be to a certain extent
arrested by isolation of the sick and daily examination of the contacts.

PART II.
Inter-State and Coastal Vessels.
The conditions under which Inter-State and coastal sea traffic is carried
on produce an epidemiological environment quite different from that
associated with oversea traffic. The journeys between ports are all short,
the passengers a fluctuating population, introduction of infection is possible
at each infected port called at, and very few coastal vessels have carried a
surgeon during the period of influenza epidemic.
It may be possible by a consideration of the occurrence of infection on
these vessels to obtain some light on the behaviour of the disease which is
not afforded by the study of oversea vessels.
The series of infected vessels dealt with in this chapter comprises all
Inter-State or coastal vessels which became infected between Ist January
and 30th April. Other vessels have been infected since 30th April, but no
new feature has been presented by any vessel infected during this later period.
Exportation Incidence in relation to Shore Epidemics.
The number of infected vessels leaving the infected capital ports have
been shown for each week from 31st January to 31st May, expressed as the
percentages of the total vessels departing which were found on examination,
or at a later stage in the voyage, to be infected.
This percentage is found to vary in close accord with the variations of
incidence of the disease in the metropolitan districts concerned. The graph
brings out this relationship clearly, exhibiting in this respect the same
phenomenon as was noticed in respect of oversea vessels.
A very noticeable feature in this graph (Graph F) is the fact that the
maximum percentage incidence occurs during the period when the epidemic
is rising to its maximum, reaches its maximum, and commences to fall
before the shore epidemic has actually reached its maximum. This
phenomenon is independent of any control measures instituted ashore.
Infected Vessels.
In the list of vessels now under consideration which comprises 92 vessels,
there were 64 in which the incubation period appeared to be within one day
after leaving port or during stay in port, there were 17 in which this period
appeared to be two days, 5 in which it appeared to be three days, and 2 in
which it appeared to be four days. There is no instance amongst all the
infected vessels in which any case appeared later than the fourth day after
leaving the last infected port.
On and after 6th February, 1919, the procedure adopted by the Common-
wealth Service, in respect of persons leaving any port for the purpose of
travelling Inter-State by sea, was as follows :
Every person was required to make a statutory declaration that
he had not been in contact with any case of influenza during the
preceding seven days; he was medically examined (including
temperature, pulse, throat examination) twice during the 72 hours
preceding dejjarture, the second examination being within 24 hours
of departure ; and finally after embarkation, as the vessel was about
to leave, all on board were again medically examined, including a
temperature record.


Under this system many intending travellers in the early stages of attack
have been excluded.
The above procedure has rendered it practically certain that, since its
inception, no has left any infected port with any temperature or other
evidence of developing attack, but, of course, such a system cannot exclude
an unrecognised contact with a case before departure. It appears definite,
therefore, that while four days is the maximum period of incubation recorded,
yet, as this period counted from the time of departure from the port, the actual
GRAPH F.—EXPORTATION INCIDENCE OF INFECTED VESSELS.
Above Sydney, below Melbourne. The graph above the line in each case represents the

of the total vessels taking their departure in each week shown.
period of incubation may possibly have been longer. If, however, this had
been so, it is more than probable that there would have been instances
of vessels on which the first case occurred on the fifth day or later. In each
of the five cases in which the period appeared to be three days, there is
considerable doubt, and it is equally likely that the period should have been


counted as two days. That there was no such instance appears to establish
definitely that four days is the maximum, incubation period, and to render
it doubtful whether three days is not the maximum period.
There are only two vessels in all this series in which a four-days’ period
is recorded. These are important enough to receive more detailed
consideration.
Argyllshire (No. 10). —This vessel carried 1,040 troops and 149 crew.
There had been during the voyage from England some cases of
influenza, the last recorded of which having occurred before arrival
in Australia. The vessel left Melbourne on sth February, arrived
at Sydney on 7th February, where she was medically inspected and
passed, all on board being well. On 9th February a soldier developed
influenza. The history of this soldier is as follows : —He had arrived
in Melbourne on troopship Mamari, stayed one night (4th February)
at a hotel in Melbourne, embarked on Argyllshire on sth February,
and early on the morning of 9th February developed initial influenzal
symptoms, thereafter experiencing a definite attack. The period
therefore in this case was from the night of 4th February to morning
of 9th February, or approximately four and a half days. This
vessel, however, had left Melbourne before the system of outward
medical control of vessels was initiated, and there is, therefore, no
evidence that another case with a very light attack was not on board
at the time of departure.
No statement can be made in any direction in this respect; it
can only be said that in this, one of the only two instances of a
four-day incubation period, that the conditions were not sufficiently
controlled to permit this instance of a four-day period to be accepted
without reserve, particularly in view of the fact that this vessel
had had influenzal cases during the voyage. It is a fact of singular
interest that no further case arose on this vessel.
Wyandra (No 7). —This vessel left Melbourne Ist February with 81 crew
and 143 passengers. The vessel arrived at Sydney on 4th February,
was inspected, and all on board were found to be well. On sth
February the assistant baker reported sick, and developed a typical
influenzal attack, his period of incubation being definitely fixable
as between 78 and 88 hours, the vessel arriving at Melbourne and
departing the same day. The remarks made about Argyllshire
apply also to this vessel, as outward medical inspections were not
commenced till after the departure of this vessel. As this vessel
was at Adelaide on 30th January, and as the Grace Darling (No. 6)
was infected at Adelaide on that date, it is not beyond question
that the apparent first case on sth February was infected from
another case, which, in the absence of medical inspection, did not
come under notice. No positive assertion in any direction is possible.
These being the only two instances of a four-day incubation period amongst
a series of oversea and Inter-State infected vessels, it is necessary to state
clearly that in neither case were the conditions sufficiently under accurate
observation to justify acceptance of any conclusion without reservation, and

that after coastal vessels were brought under continuous medical inspection,
inward and outward, at every port, no instance of an incubation period
longer than three days was discovered amongst 82 infected coastal vessels.
The cases on these vessels occurred within two days after the Common-
wealth Quarantine Service had proposed a mode of procedure for controlling
Inter-State sea traffic, exciting considerable criticism and opposition, which
appeared to be supported by these two instances. No other such case
■occurred subsequently.
On one voyage of the Tasmanian mail steamer Loongana (7th April) a
■case of pneumonia occurred on the seventh day. This case was, however,
■definitely an uninfective simple lobar pneumonia.
The experience recorded in the series now under discussion appears to
justify the statement that the incubation period of influenza on shipboard
has not, under conditions permitting of exact observation, exceeded three
■days.
Extent and Duration of Ship Epidemics.
In this series of coastal vessels the conditions were such as to permit of
more accurate observation in at least one respect than was possible in the
■case of oversea vessels. On the latter vessels one case might occur or even
more, and, all being recovered on arrival, the temptation for the Master to
conceal the cases might be too strong—-no information consequently reaching
the quarantine officer. On coastal vessels, by reason of the constant inspection,
this is not possible.
The large proportion of the vessels in this series on which only one case
■occurred is noteworthy; such vessels varied from a vessel with a crew of
10 to a troopship with 1,200 persons on board.
The group of vessels with less than ten cases included cargo vessels with no
passenger list and passenger vessels with from 2to 500 passengers. In each
■of these vessels the same feature is noticed as was recorded for oversea vessels,
namely, that the disease was at first confined to that department of the
ship s company which was first attacked, in some cases, e.g., Melbourne
(No. 25), not spreading beyond that department; in others, spreading in a
haphazard way to other sections of the ship’s conrpany.
Other vessels on which there occurred more than ten cases presented
features of special interest.
These were—


Dimboola (1) (No. 3).—-Vessel left Melbourne 31st January, arrived
Sydney 3rd February, with 67 crew and 32 passengers. The first
case developed on Ist February, six cases occurring on Ist and 2nd
February, all except one in the engineer’s department. Thereafter
cases occurred as follow :

The total cases were eighteen amongst the crew and twelve
amongst the passengers, or approximately 27 per cent, of crew and
36 per cent, of passengers. The epidemic amongst 99 persons was
complete in eight days.
Wyandra (1) (No. 7).—Vessel arrived Sydney on 4th February with
81 crew and 143 passengers. The first case was the assistant baker,
and thereafter seamen, stewards, and firemen were attacked without
any definite sequence, a total of seventeen cases altogether occurring
amongst the crew, no case occurring amongst the passengers ; the
epidemic amongst a total ship’s company of 224 persons being
complete in nine days. The sequence of cases was as follows :

Ooma (No. 11).—Whilst lying at Melbourne this vessel, with a crew of
56 (11 Europeans and 45 Filipinos) and no passengers, experienced
a severe epidemic of influenza. The first case, the boa.tswa.in,
occurred on 15th February. The sequence of cases was as follows .
17th February .. .. 4 cases amongst the deck hands.
18th .. •• 10 cases, comprising 8 deck hands,
1 fireman, 1 officer.
19th .. .. 12 cases in all parts of the ship.
20th „ .. .. 19 cases.
21st „ .. .. No cases.
22nd „ .. 3 cases.
26th „ .. -.1 case.
In all 50 cases occurred with six deaths. The epidemic attacked
89 per cent, of the total ship’s company, and was complete in twelve
days. Even in this case it is noticeable that the epidemic spread
first amongst the section of the ship’s company which was first
attacked. With regard to the case on 26th February, there is good


reason for believing that this man had gained access to patients in
the wards, and was infected in this way. If this case be excluded,
the epidemic was complete in eight days.
Pacifique (No. 51). —This vessel was lying in Sydney Harbor when the
epidemic commenced. The crew consisted of 74 persons (white 26,
coloured 48), and there were 7 passengers.
The daily incidence of cases was—-
9th April . . .. .. .. 3
10th „ .. .. .. .. 9

12th „ .. .. .. .. 6
13th „ .. .. .. .. 2
14th „ .. .... .. 3
15th „ .. .. .. .. 2
16th „ .. .. .. .. 3
The incidence on the ship’s departments is very striking—
9th April .. 3 firemen.
10th ~ 8 firemen, 1 “ boy.”
11th „ .. 7 firemen, 8 “boys,” 7 seamen, 1 carpenter.
12th ~ 1 fireman, 2 “ boys,” 2 seamen, 1 surgeon.
13th ~ .. 0 fireman, 0 “ boy,” 1 seaman, 1 officer.
14th „ .. 0 fireman, 0 “ boy,” 1 seaman, 1 passenger.
15th „ 0 fireman, 1 “ boy,” 1 cook.
16th ~ 0 fireman, 2 “ boys,” 1 seaman.
The progression is regular; the firemen were first infected, then
the “ boys,” then the seamen, whilst the incidence on officers and
passengers was very slight.
The epidemic was complete amongst 83 persons in eight days,
51 persons having been attacked.
E'ncounter (No. 21). —This was a striking epidemic in that there was an
initial stage of four days, then a sudden explosive outbreak lasting
from 16th March to 20th March, and involving 92 cases. All the
cases were removed to the Quarantine Hdspital on 18th March.
After 20th March there was no further case.
St. George (No. 43). —This outbreak was of a special nature, as every
member of the coloured crew was sick when the cases were found,
the rest of the crew having deserted.
Australglen (No. 5). —An epidemic of nineteen cases amongst 50 persons,
beginning on 2nd February and complete on 15th February. The
sequence so far as it is known was —
2nd February ~ .. • ■ • • 1
9th ~ .. . • • • • • 1
10th „ .. • • • ■ • • 4
11th „ .. .. • • • • 2
12th „ .. • ■ •• • • 1
13th „ .. • • ■ ■ •• 7
14th „ .. .. • • •• 2
15th ~ .. • • • • • • 1


There is some doubt as to the period between 2nd February and
9th February during which the vessel was not under observation.
All cases were isolated on and after 13th February. This outbreak
is notable by reason of its definite limitation to the department
of the ship (deck crew) first attacked.
Wyandra (2) (No. 68). —Amongst a company of 375 there were 32 cases.
Eleven of these occurred before control was attempted, and not-
withstanding immediate isolation of cases as soon as they occurred
and daily medical inspection 21 further cases developed. The
epidemic from first to last covered fifteen days, and isolation
commenced on the sixth day. This instance is noteworthy by reason
of the limitation of the outbreak, so far as passengers were concerned,
to the first class passengers.
Mourilyan (No. 71). —Amongst 144 persons on this vessel 67 cases occurred
between 17th April and 4th May, a total period of eighteen days.
Of 45 crew 24 were attacked, and of 99 passengers 43 were attacked.
A notable feature is that at first the outbreak was limited to the
crew, later becoming mostly limited to the passengers.
Oonah (No. 60). —Vessel left Sydney 7th April with 76 passengers, 56 crew,
and arrived at Hobart on 10th April. The first case developed
Bth April. The sequence of cases was as follows : —-
Bth April .. 1 case .. steward.
10th ~ . . 2 cases .. 1 fireman, 1 .passenger.
11th ~ 1 case .. 1 fireman. •
12th ~ . . 3 cases .. 1 fireman, 2 passengers.
13th „ .. 2 „ .. 2 firemen.
14th „ .. 3 „ .. 3 „
15th ~ .. 1 case .. 2nd engineer.
16th ~ ..1 ~ .. 3rd officer.
In this instance the infection seems to have been chiefly limited
to the firemen, fourteen cases in all occurring amongst 132 persons,
with two deaths. The epidemic was complete in eight days.
This series of vessels presents certain striking features. The infection in
each case was of Australian origin, the epidemic showed a definite tendency
to limit itself to that section of the ship’s company in which it first appeared,
even in those vessels in which it subsequently overran these limits.
Three of these instances, viz., Ooma, Pacifique, Encounter , are of interest,
because of the large percentage of the ship’s complement attacked. In
Ooma there were 88 per cent., in Pacifique 64 per cent., and in Encounter
41 per cent. The death rates also were high in two of these cases, namely,
Ooma 12 per cent., and Pacifique 9 per cent. These very extensive outbreaks,
in which the death rate indicated no difference in severity from death rates
amongst vessels from overseas, are worthy of close study in comparison with
the outbreaks on vessels from overseas previously discussed. They are more
valuable, inasmuch as the outbreaks were under close observation from the
first day, and certain measures of control were fully applied throughout.

considering these outbreaks on the lines adopted for the discussion of
principal features of outbreaks on oversea vessels, the factors of control may
be reviewed in the same order.
This series of vessels developed outbreaks involving a more or less large
percentage of the ship’s company, and were brought under administrative
control at very early stages in the outbreak.
It is obvious that such measures as were adopted by the Quarantine
Service had ample opportunity for thorough testing, and that all failed in
preventing the spread of infection to a greater or less extent.
Inhalation.
Inhalation. —This method was used in almost every case daily with
thoroughness, precluding any error from inefficiency. As almost all of the
cases on these vessels occurred in spite of daily inhalation by the zinc sulphate
steam method, it is obvious that this method has no effect in stopping the
course of an epidemic.
Inoculation.
Inoculation. —On three vessels, Ooma (No. 11), Pacifique (No. 51), and
Encounter (No. 21), inoculation received a complete and exhaustive test.
The inoculation state on each was as follows :
Ooma. —All on board had been inoculated once on 3rd December with
Commonwealth coryza vaccine.
Pacifique. —All on board had been inoculated once in February with
Commonwealth influenza vaccine.
Encounter. —. All on board had been inoculated with Commonwealth
coryza vaccine as follows :
1 c.c. of “ A ” Strength on 26th November.
1 c.c. of “ B ” strength on 29th November.
1 c.c. of “ B ” strength on 22nd December.
It is obvious that, as two of these three vessels had more extensive :
outbreaks than any other vessels trading Inter-State, inoculation with vaccine
of the composition used had no effect in pre venting the spread of the disease re-


There is, however, a striking fact in connexion with both Encounter
(Table D, No. 21) and Fantome (Table C, No. 13). Each of these vessels
had very extensive outbreaks amongst a ship population, every member of
which had been vaccinated. On Fantome 62 per cent, and on Encounter
41 per cent, were attacked, but although the total cases on the two vessels
amounted to 170, there was no death amongst the company of either ship.
There is no similar record of protection against death in the case of any
other widely-infected vessel.
Exhaustion of Susceptible Material.
As there had not been any sufficiently extensive epidemic in Melbourne
or Sydney at the time of departure of Dimboola (No. 3) and Oonah (No. 60)
respectively, it can hardly be thought that any considerable proportion of
the ship’s company was immune. These vessels, therefore, must be regarded
as containing a homogeneous human population in respect of susceptibility.
That the epidemic did not spread beyond a small proportion in each case
must be taken as evidence that the attacked did not represent the full
quantity of available susceptible material, the epidemic ceasing because this
was exhausted. The evidence available in respect of oversea ships was seen
to support this conclusion.
There is, however, an interesting aspect in this connexion provided by
the two vessels Pacijique (No. 51) and Ooma (No. 11). In each case the crews
consisted of coloured persons. When these vessels are considered along
with Atua (see Table C), in which case the crew were Fijians, and which
provided one of the most extensive outbreaks amongst oversea vessels, the
question of relative susceptibility of whites and coloured persons necessarily
arises, and it is clear that in our experience the epidemic on a vessel with
a coloured crew, not previously in contact with the recent pandemic form,
suffers more extensively and with a more fatal form of the disease than a
vessel with white crews only. Relative susceptibility, and consequently
exhaustion of susceptible material, must enter into consideration, at least
in a comparison between the two classes of vessels. That they function as
controlling factors in determining the limitations of an epidemic is, in the
light of the experience here recorded, very improbable.
Isolation of the Sick.
In every one of the vessels now under consideration, a daily thermometer
parade was held, and every person showing any rise of temperature was at
once removed for observation. In addition, any person reporting sick was
immediately removed. This was most thoroughly and efficiently carried
out, and it can safely be asserted that the sick were removed in every case
immediately on discovery. No better test of the efficacy of immediate
isolation of the infectious sick could well be devised. That this method
failed to control epidemics is clear from the vessels dealt with in this series.
In spite of this method applied from the first day, Ooma showed 89 per cent,
of personnel infected, Pacijique 64 per cent, of her personnel , Mourilyan 46 per
cent., and Dimboola 30 per cent.
That such a result was not limited to vessels with coloured crews was seen
in the case of Dimboola (1) and Oonah, in which 30 per cent, and 10 per cent.


respectively of the ship's company were attacked, although the isolation of
the sick was applied from the third day in each case.
This experience seems to suggest two alternatives. As a 24-hour inspection
with immediate isolation is insufficient to prevent spread, there is suggested
either [a) an infecting or predisposing agent external to the human body,
or ( b ) a condition of extreme infectivity at so early a stage that a 24-hour
parade is insufficient to secure the removal of all infected cases.
On general principles, the latter hypothesis is the more likely, indicating
that, in the course of this disease, any sick person is highly infectious from
the very moment of onset.
Natural Diminution of Virulence.
With the exclusion of inhalation, inoculation, and hospitalization as
effective agents in the control of epidemics on shipboard, and in the absence
of any evidence of the activity of any agent external to the human body
[e.y., insect vector), it appears to be reasonable to conclude that the infecting
virus—whatever it is—exhibits a strong intrinsic tendency towards natural
decline in virulence and infectivity, and that this tendency is the controlling
factor in limiting epidemics on shipboard. It is possible that this is affected
to a certain extent by a natural racial susceptibility or an acquired immunity.
This natural tendency towards decline in infective power, combined with
a very limited effective range of infectivity, operate to produce the constant
limitation of epidemics to that section of the ship’s 'personnel which is first
attacked.
The contrast between the shorter average period amongst ships infected
in Australia and the longer average epidemic period of ships infected overseas
during the extremely severe pandemic is probably explicable on the hypothesis
of a less potent virus or agent present in Australia, and assists to establish
the belief that the disease with which Australia has been attacked during
February, March, and April of 1919 is different in either nature or virulence
from that which ravaged overseas countries during October, November, and
December of 1918.
Stated briefly, the practical application of the above is that an epidemic
of influenza on shipboard will run a definite course, will die out when this
course is run, and that no known administrative procedure will appreciably
modify the time factor ; although the early detection and isolation of cases
appears to be of value in reducing the total number of cases, and much
can be done to mitigate the severity of attack in individual cases.
All of the above constitutes an unprejudiced study of the course of the
disease under most favorable conditions for the accurate scientific study of
its natural history.
The conclusions arrived at cannot in any way be regarded as affecting the
question of the efficacy of maritime quarantine in protecting any country
against invasion by the disease. This important question will be considered
in the next chapter.

CHAPTER V.
THE RESULT OF MARITIME QUARANTINE DEFENCE.
The application of the principles and practice of maritime quarantine,
in an attempt to exclude a disease like influenza, afforded an opportunity for
an interesting series of large-scale operations.
It was freely predicted that such an attempt on the lines adopted, or
indeed on any lines, was inevitably bound to fail. This possibility was
recognised at the outset of operations, and the Director of Quarantine stated
in the official Minute to the Minister that—
“ It is necessary to point out that influenza is one of the most rapidly
spreading of all infectious diseases, and while the measures now being intro-
duced afford reasonable grounds for anticipating complete protection against
the introduction of the disease, it is impossible to give any firm guarantee
that the disease will be entirely excluded.’ 5
The extreme rapidity of infection, which has always characterized influenza,
and the lack of exact knowledge of the natural history of the disease, intro-
duced possibilities of error which could not be provided against in advance.
It becomes, therefore, a matter of considerable epidemiological interest
to determine the extent to which the measures adopted proved to be successful.
It is unfortunate that the purity of the result was affected by the occurrence
of influenza within Australia at a late stage in the course of events which,
by reason of the nature of the disease when it did appear, has introduced
complications.
The maritime quarantine operations on the basis already described lasted
during the months of October, November, December, January, February,
March and April. During that time there were dealt with 149 uninfected
vessels, with 7,075 passengers and 7,941 crew, and 79 infected vessels, with
2,795 patients, 48,072 passengers, and 10,456 crew.
A verdict, as to whether these measures proved to be successful or other-
wise, could only be arrived at in two ways, either by a demonstration
that* there had been a definite chain of infection from a specific ship to the
shore population—the continuity of infection being proved, and the identity
of the disease on shore established—or by the occurrence of an epidemic
on shore during the period of quarantine operations with characteristics
identical with those encountered on vessels dealt with in quarantine.
It may be definitely stated at the outset that there has never, at any
time, been produced any evidence of an escape of infection by a demonstrable
chain from persons or vessels in quarantine to the shore population. Evidence,
therefore, of such complete breakdown of the quarantine system is entirely
wanting.


On the other hand, the fact that there occurred in the middle of January
certain cases in Melbourne which presented symptoms similar to those ex-
perienced amongst influenza cases in quarantine, and that immediately
following the occurrence of these cases there developed a more or less
extensive epidemic in Victoria, followed by epidemics in South Australia.
New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia, affected the situation
in a number of directions.
The relationship of this epidemic influenza within Australia to the possi-
bility of importation from overseas may be discussed from various points
of view.
It is definite, in the first place, that there was no demonstrable connexion
between the cases in Melbourne and any recognized source of infection arriv-
ing by any overseas vessel. It is also well established that during the
months of October, November and December there was no extensive or
virulent epidemic of influenza in any State of Australia.
That there were cases of fatal influenza will presently be shown, but
there was nothing that can be in any way likened to the extraordinarily
severe form of the disease which attacked South Africa and New Zealand,
and there was certainly no outbreak affecting even so large a proportion
of the population as the outbreaks in February and March.
It may be stated definitely that, during the three months, mari-
time quarantine had the effect of holding at the sea frontiers an intensely
virulent and intensely infective form of influenza, which not only caused
disastrous epidemics in New Zealand and South Africa, but actually arrived
at the maritime frontiers of Australia and caused serious epidemics amongst
vessels detained in quarantine.
The history of these vessels has already been discussed in a previous
chapter, but the descriptions therein do not convey an adequate idea of the
severity and rapidity of spread of the disease.
It may be permissible to give a brief extract from a report by an un-
impressionable senior officer on the conditions existing on the transport
Medic on his first inspection—
The scene on board was remarkable. A score or more of stalwart young men lay
helpless about the after well-deck, awaiting transport to the improvised and overflowing
hospitals in the troop-decks. That they lay there was not due to any neglect or delay on
the part of the busy stretcher-bearers, but to the extraordinarily sudden and disabling onset
of the disease. One smart, well set-up young soldier came up a companion-ladder close
to where I stood, held on for a few seconds to a rail, and then sagged slowly down till he
assumed the characteristic flattened sprawl on the deck. There was no pretence or “ old-
soldiering ” about it. The men were being literally knocked down by a profound
systematic intoxication of extraordinarily rapid onset.
That the conditions existing in October and November in South Africa
and New Zealand were extremely severe, and that the epidemic presented
characteristics so entirely out of the ordinary experience as to excite a feeling
of apprehension approaching closely to panic, is seen from the following


cables received from the responsible Government authorities in these two
countries. These cables are as follow :
New Zealand.
Can safely say true influenza type has been replaced by pneumonic and septicaemia
types; preferably call it epidemic pneumonia (stop) epidemic spreads just as quickly as
people move from place to place by tram or- train or motor (stop) mortality is appalling
(stop) treatment by vaccine utterly futile once this epidemic is started (stop) no attempt
made here give prophylactic vaccine, because insufficient medical and nursiag aid avail-
able for either step, and infinitely too slow to catch up with speed of spreading (stop)
only effective precautionary measure your side will be to prevent introduction of
epidemic pneumonia into Australia,
South Africa.
In view of the terrible experience through which South Africa is passing as result of
violent outbreak of so-called Spanish influenza, with highly pneumonic characteristics,
the Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa considers it advisable to draw your
special attention to the extreme seriousness of the malady, with a view to the possibility
of timely measures being taken by your Government to prevent its introduction from
overseas. The malady is infectious in the highest degree, and produces extreme prostra-
tion, with an appalling death rate among coloured people and natives, while among
Europeans, after a week’s experience, there is now distinctly increased seriousness in the
character of attacks. At Kimberley yesterday 50, Europeans died ; at Cape Town a still
larger number; while coloured persons and natives at these cities are dying daily in
hundreds. The Prime Minister is anxious that your country should be spared a similar
calamity, and accordingly takes this step to give you timely warning.
The text of these cables differs so much from the ordinary tone of official
communications that it is evident a state of public alarm existed in the two
countries cbncerned, to which there has not been any parallel in Australia,
even during the period of maximum prevalence of influenza epidemic.
The conditions have not even yet, up to the end of June, been such as to
justify an attitude which was clearly justifiable in these two countries. The
population was so severely attacked in each of these countries as to justify
the Royal Commission in South Africa stating that 32 per cent, of all
Europeans in the Union were attacked, and 46 per cent, of coloured persons,
while the numbers of deaths between the Ist August and 30th November
were 11,726 Europeans and 127,745 coloured persons —a total of 139,471
persons who died from influenza in the South African Union, or death rate
per thousand of population of 22'8—that amongst Europeans being 8 - 2,
and amongst coloured persons 27 •1. The total population of the South
African Union is given in the official return as 1,418,060 Europeans and
4,697,152 coloured persons, a total of 6,115,212.
Although these figures are given for the period from Ist August to 30th
November, it is stated by the Commission that the earliest date which can
be fixed for the outbreak is 14th September.
Taking the estimated population of Victoria at the end of 1917 as having
been, 1,411,004, it is obvious that if the disease had been as prevalent in
October, November, and December, it would have accounted for 11,667
deaths from this cause alone, whereas the actual number of deaths from
influenza in Victoria during these three months whs 128. i ; ::


Similarly, in New South Wales, with a population of 1,890,654, the
number of deaths which should have occurred on the same basis was 15,633,
iwhereas the actual number was 207.
Adopting New Zealand as basis of comparison on the other hand, it is
officially reported that 33 per cent, of the population were there affected,
the number of deaths during October, November, and December being 5,471.
The estimated population of New Zealand for 1917 was 1,160,188.
On this basis Victoria should have had, if the disease had been equally
prevalent and equally virulent, 6,652 deaths, and New South Wales 8,915
deaths.
The history of the disease in other countries, which lias been elsewhere
described, shows very clearly that the months of September, October,
November, and December were the months of greatest prevalence and
virulence in those countries from which Australia was liable to be directly
attacked, and the facts now given are clear evidence that that period of
danger was completed without any infection having been introduced into
Australia which within that time produced any prevalence of influenza
suggesting even in any faint degree such a catastrophe as other countries
had to record; and it is an established fact that, whatever influenza incidence
obtained during those months, it was not to be considered as being in any
way comparable epidemiologically with the disastrous pandemic form of
influenza which spread from country to country in every country in the
world except Australia, and which was largely complete by the end of
December.
. The quarantine period of all vessels with outbreaks of this overseas virulent
form of influenza which arrived in Australian ports, and which were dealt
with in Quarantine Stations, had been entirely completed, and all known
danger of infection had been terminated by the end of the first week in
January.
On 9th January, however, the first cases of the local epidemic were.recorded
in Melbourne. These excited no comment, and were not known to the State
health authorities until some days afterwards, when the occurrence of further
cases excited attention, and on 20th January it was determined that some
50 to 100 cases had occurred in Melbourne of a disease which appeared,
from the accounts received, to resemble the severe form of influenza.
This disease has spread steadily until it has invaded five States, and as there
is,a certain amount of evidence that a similar form of infection was prevalent
during 1918, it is of great epidemiological interest to state any evidence avail-
able which may throw light on the question of the importation of fresh
infection. It is possible to do this at this stage, although the epidemic is
still prevalent, as a period of seven months’ operations are now available —-
the first three of which were characterized by intense infection in overseas
countries, the latter four were characterized by very much reduced incidence
of influenza overseas, and by the continued application of maritime quarantine
and the occurrence of epidemics in four States.

The position in regard to 1918 is as follows : —ln each of the six States
of Australia there was, during September, October, November, and December,
an unusual prevalence of influenza quite out of the annual average of
past years. While this applied to the figures for influenza, it did not apply
to figures for acute bronchitis, broncho-pneumonia, and pneumonia, which
were not unduly prevalent as causes of death.
These figures are as follows, and the accompanying tables and graphs
given herewith show the rise in prevalence of influenza for 1918, as compared
with previous years : —-

Interesting collateral evidence is available from various sources. It was
a familiar enough fact that in September there was a very extensive outbreak
of influenza in Sydney—unofficial estimates stating that 30 per cent, of the
population of the city and suburbs suffered from this disease. During Sep-
tember, at Lithgow, there was a very virulent form of influenza prevalent,
complicated with pneumonia, with a course very similar to those subsequently
seen. The number of deaths from this cause during September in Lithgow
was eighteen, four during October, and seven during November.


The transport Bor da, which left Sydney on 18th July, arrived at Durban
on 17th August, and the following history of the voyage is of interest in this
connexion :
During the first few days after embarkation, a number of men on board
suffered from colds and tonsilitis, daily sick parades numbering from 4 to 6
per cent, of the total number of troops. When nine days out from Fremantle

(6th August), the sick parades became gradually double their size from an
outbreak of a form of influenza. The outbreak commenced to abate about
the 15th August.
This vessel, according to official advices received from South Africa, landed
two cases of pneumonia and nine cases of influenza.
At Lockhart, in the southern portion of New South Wales, there was,
during October, a severe form of influenza and pneumonia of a fatal type.

These figures are furnished by the courtesy of the Statist in each State.
At the Melbourne Hospital in November there were approximately 30
cases of a form of influenza, sufficiently severe in type to excite comment.
All the evidence, therefore, shows that there had been in various parts of
Australia during 1918, and before any possible risk of infection from countries
having direct communication with Australia, an unusual prevalence of
influenza, and the statistics show that this continued in a quietly progressive
form during October, November, and December. After 20th January the
presence of epidemic influenza in an unusually severe and unusually extensive
form was well established, and from that time onwards a definite epidemic
became fully declared, and has, up till the present, affected five States.
The weekly incidence of Victorian deaths up to May 30th is corrected
so that deaths are tabulated according to the actual date of death. The
New South Wales figures and Victorian figures after May 30th, on the other
hand, are tabulated according to the date of registration.
It is as yet too early for comparative figures to be forthcoming from other
countries, but the graph included here shows the actual graph of the weekly
death rates for Philadelphia, San Francisco and New South Wales, showing
0.8662.—5


each by death-rates per 100,000 of the population at the height of the epi-
demic curve. It is obvious that there is no comparison between the extremely
severe maximum death-rate of 250 per 100,000 of population in Philadelphia
and the maximum death-rate of 33 • 5 per 100,000 in New South Wales, or 18 * 7
in Victoria. Neither does the total death-rate for the period in any State
approach the 517 rate in New Zealand, or the 826 rate in South Africa.
GRAPH H. —Showing comparative death-rates from Influenza in (above) Philadelphia, (middle)
San Francisco, (below) New South Wales. This graph was prepared before 20th June, 1919.
The facts as elicited by comparison with the concurrent experience of other
countries in the Southern Hemisphere with the same seasonal conditions
and reasonably similar population-distribution, justify the statement that
the rigid enforcement of quarantine measures throughout October, November,
December of 1918 saved Australia from the disaster suffered by both South
Africa and New Zealand, and this in spite of the fact that all the quarantine
stations in Australia were kept extremely active in dealing with arriving
vessels infected with a disease showing no less severity or less extreme fatality
than was seen in those other countries.
Although six months of 1919 have now elapsed, it is equally true that
Australia has not yet experienced any epidemic manifestation which can be
compared in severity with that ordeal through which New Zealand and South
Africa have passed.
A most striking illustration of the value of maritime quarantine, and of
the disaster arising from neglect to use this weapon, is afforded by the history
of the small trading steamer Talune.
This vessel left New Zealand in the last week in October when influenza
was well established in New Zealand. She arrived at Suva on 4th November,
1918, and on arrival had on board some cases of influenza. So'ine passengers
were landed, three of whom developed influenza after landing. The first
known European case of influenza, apart from these passengers, was seen


on Bth November, the second on 10th November. Thence the epidemic
spread rapidly through Fiji. The vessel left for Tonga and Samoa, taking
a gang of Fijian labourers to work the ship.
The vessel called at Samoa and then proceeded to Tonga, where she
arrived on 12th November, no restrictions being placed on the landing of
passengers or cargo. A day or two after the steamer left for Suva cases of
influenza began to make their appearance, and the epidemic spread through
the island until practically the whole native population had been stricken.
At Samoa the same story was told. This one vessel infected three island
groups, and produced a scourging epidemic with an appalling mortality.
Concerning the outbreak in Samoa and Tonga, Surgeon Grey —in command
of the Medical Relief Expedition sent from Australia—reported that there
were 7,264 deaths in Samoa amongst a total population of 36,405, or 20 per
cent, of the population. Tonga got off comparatively lightly with a mortality
of only 7 per cent, of the entire population.” It left New Zealand about the
same time as the transport Medic , and there can be no question that but
for the rigid quarantine measures that were employed, the dark days of New
Zealand would have been eclipsed in Australia.
It is, nevertheless, quite reasonably urged that influenza did at last
become epidemic in Australia, and the question of the relationship of this
phase of epidemic influenza to the success or failure of quarantine measures
should be discussed.
It has already been stated that there is no trace of direct evidence of
escape of infection from any vessel to the shore. It is of considerable interest
that the Australian epidemic began in Victoria, in which State there had
been the least amount of active infection dealt with on any quarantine station,
and where all administrative details were under a supervision at least as
careful as at any other point in Australia. The quarantine service is a
Federal service, and for a few weeks immediately prior to the occurrence
of cases in Victoria, the Quarantine Station in Victoria had as a result of
necessary transfers of staff been controlled by senior officers who had had
large experience in controlling this disease at the Quarantine Station in
Sydney.
The behaviour of the Australian infection on board vessels infected in
Australia offers some distinct points of difference from that seen on oversea
vessels arriving in Australian ports. The course of the disease is verv
definitely shorter, the ship epidemic being in most cases complete in an eight-
day period as against the uniformly longer period seen on oversea vessels,
on which a minimum of fourteen days was constant.
A reference to the respective graphs shows also a quite distinct form of
curve. The strikingly slower progress of the epidemic from State to State
and from place to place within a State differentiates it clearly from the
experience of other countries. For example, the epidemic was at its height
in New York on 26th October, and in San Francisco on 2nd November. In
Melbourne the epidemic was well established on 31st January, but in Sydney
the epidemic did not become extensive until March. In South Australia,
although the deaths were recorded early in February, the death rate has
never become more than comparatively insignificant.


The evidence from the clinical side does not throw much light on the
question. There appears to be no definite feature of the clinical course of
this disease which would differentiate it from the disease as described in
oversea countries, or as seen on vessels in quarantine infected in other
countries, unless such a distinction is to be found in the lower percentage
of persons with severe pulmonary involvement, and the noticeably lower
frequency of empyema.
It is clear that at least since July of 1918 there has been in Australia a
form of influenza exhibiting characteristics indistinguishable from those of
the disease now prevalent, but with a lesser infectivity. Nothing that is at
present known of this disease is in any way inconsistent with the hypothesis
of the evolution of an infection already present in Australia to a stage
manifesting greater virulence and infectivity, but not attaining that intense
degree of virulence and infectivity seen in the closing quarter of 1918 in
every country in the world except Australia.
The factors associated with this evolution are difficult to identify. They
are possibly meteorological, though there is no direct measurable evidence
of this. A careful and exhaustive survey of suggested agents has failed to
reveal any hypothetical factor whose claims can be established.
It may, in conclusion, be said that Australia was the only country in the
world which escaped a devastating infection of most exalted virulence, that
this escape was directly and solely the result of the work of the Common-
wealth Quarantine Service, and was attained by the holding in quarantine of
every infected vessel during the six months of danger, until the epidemic on
each ship had been brought to an end.
The relationship of the epidemic which is still prevalent in Australia to
overseas infection on the one hand, or to an already present infection on the
other hand, may be, and doubtless will be, the subject of discussion, but it is
legitimate to say that the evidence available points more directly to a slow
evolution of an established local infection than to the introduction of fresh
sources of infection from outside.
Even if this were not so, it can at least be claimed that the work of the
Quarantine Service held the infection in check for at least a sufficiently long
period to insure a considerable natural exhaustion of virulence measured by
a death rate of less than 20 per hundred thousand as against a death rate of
517 on the same population basis.
The advocates of internal Inter-State quarantine at the November Con'
ference urged those measures partly on the ground that such restrictions on
traffic would permit of such natural exhaustion of virulence in the delayed
passage of infection from State to State. The relative experience of South
Australia and New South Wales as compared each with Victoria establishes
the fallacy of the assumption, New South Wales having a higher and South
Australia a much lower death rate than Victoria, whereas South Australia
applied in fact less extreme traffic restriction than New South Wales. This,
by implication, assists to dispose of the suggestion that the infection escaped
quarantine barriers in a less virulent form, and to establish the hypothesis of
the evolution of a local infection.


CHAPTER VI.
THE EPIDEMIC WITHIN AUSTRALIA AND INTER-STATE
QUARANTINE.
It was recognised from the commencement of quarantine operations that,,
as the application of maritime quarantine to influenza had not been tried
previously on any large scale, the probability of a successful outcome could
not bo completely assessed, and it was, therefore, wise to make provision in
advance for the possibility of an epidemic occurring in any part of Australia.
The Commonwealth Government, therefore, although the quarantine
measures adopted were proving successful, considered it advisable to summon
a Conference of delegates from the various States to agree upon a uniform
scheme of operations for adoption in the event of an epidemic occurring within
any part of Australia.
These measures, naturally, were of two kinds—
(а) Measures intended to limit the spread of disease to the original
focus or the State in which it first appeared, and
(б) Measures applied in the district in which the epidemic was prevalent
for its control.
The representatives from each State consisted of the Minister for Public
Health, the professional head of the Health Department, and the President
of the local branch of the British Medical Association. The resolutions
adopted at this Conference were as follow :
1. That the disease be designated pneumonic influenza.
2. That in view of the heavy mortality attendant on epidemics of
pneumonic influenza in other countries, and the evidence
that its spread coincides with the rate of human travel, this
Conference is of opinion that it is desirable in the public interest
to take any measures to check public travel that are at all
likely to lessen the spread of the disease. It is recognised that
such restriction does not afford an absolute safeguard, and is
liable to prove ineffective at some stage in the course of the
epidemic ; but the Conference, while recognising this, never-
theless considers that the attempt to limit the original outbreak
by this means should be made, and should be continued until
proved unsuccessful, in order to give neighbouring States time
to complete their organization, and also to afford a delay
which may result in some diminution of the virulence of the-
epidemic.
3. That the Chief Health Officer should immediately notify to the
Director of Quarantine the presence of any case of pneumonic
influenza in his State, and that the Commonwealth should
take steps to proclaim the State to be infected with pneumonic
influenza.


4. That, upon the proclamation of any State as infected, all traffic
with that State he suspended until a case breaks out in a neigh-
bouring State, when traffic may be resumed between the infected
States—
Provided that Inter-State sea traffic be permitted subject
to strict quarantine, no person being allowed to travel
from the infected State, except on a permit issued by
the Commonwealth Government.
Provided further that these restrictions shall not apply to
Inter-State local traffic amongst residents within 10 miles
of the border of any State in an area which is clean,
or to such further areas as may be exempted with the
concurrence of the contiguous States and of the Common-
wealth Government.
5. That upon the proclamation of any State as infected, the Common-
wealth should take complete control of all Inter-State traffic
both by land and sea, and that the States should render to the
Commonwealth every possible aid, and co-operate in the
effective carrying out of the regulations.
6. That in the event of an outbreak of pneumonic influenza no restric-
tive measures need be applied to traffic as between State and
State in respect of goods and mails, provided that all care be
exercised to prevent personal contact between persons handling
the goods.
7. That this Conference is of opinion that in order to deal with pneu-
monic influenza, there should be local district isolation and
quarantine by each State ; that if any State has not sufficient
power to effect this, it should obtain such power, and that the
Chief Executive Officer of the Health Department should keep
the Chief Quarantine Officer of the State concerned advised
of the progress of the epidemic and of the action taken.
8. That the repeal of the proclamation declaring any State to be infected
with pneumonic influenza be left in the hands of the Common-
wealth Government.
9. That it be recommended that an Advisory Committee be appointed
in each State, consisting of the Chief Health Officers and a limited
number of members of the British Medical Association.
10. The Conference recommends that immediate action be taken by the
States for- —
(1) The establishment of vaccine depots.
(2) The establishment of special hospitals and the organization
of ambulance transport.
(3) The organization of medical and nursing assistance.
(4) The issue of advice to local authorities through the press
and by circular.
(5) Arranging for the supply of respirators to the public.


11. The Conference recommends that in the event of an outbreak of
pneumonic influenza in any State it is considered advisable to
close all places of public resort such as theatres, music halls,
picture shows, race meetings, churches, schools ; to prohibit all
public meetings ; and to take action for the regulation of all
out-patient departments of general hospitals.
12. The Conference recommends the Commonwealth Government to
request the Minister of Defence to immediately disband all
military camps until all immediate danger of an outbreak of
pneumonic influenza has passed.
13. The Conference recommends that the Commonwealth Government
should request the Minister of Defence to hold the military
medical and nursing organization available in such a way that
they can be utilized in any part of the Commonwealth, in the
event of an outbreak of the disease, for service under the
direction of the State health authorities.
These resolutions contemplate an attempt to limit the spread of the
disease by checking public travel as far as practicable, and to give effect to
this as between States it was provided, by resolution 4, “ That, upon
the proclamation of any State as infected, all traffic with that State should
be suspended until a case breaks out in a neighbouring State, when traffic
may be resumed.”
The attitude of the Commonwealth representatives, based upon the
experience of quarantine administration —in which field the Commonwealth
Quarantine Service had had considerably more experience than the other
delegates—was stated by the Commonwealth Minister controlling quarantine
administration, Hon. W. Massy Greene, who was Chairman of the Conference.
The Minister said—
“ We do not think it would be possible to use the Quarantine Act
or Regulations in an effective way in an attempt to.limit the disease
to any of the other States by establishing a border line. For all
practical purposes it would not be possible to quarantine an area on
the mainland other than, possibly, the State of Western Australia.”
It was considered, however, by the other delegates that an attempt
should be made to entirely suspend all Inter-State traffic by land so long as
no case occurred in a previously clean adjoining State.
This view was adopted by the majority, and accordingly embodied in the
resolutions of the Conference; but the unreliability of this measure was
indicated in the second portion of resolution 2, as follows :
“It is recognised that such restriction does not afford an absolute
safeguard and is liable to prove ineffective at some stage in the course
of the epidemic, but the Conference, while recognising this, never-
theless considers that the attempt to limit the original outbreak by
this means should be made, and should be continued until proved
unsuccessful, in order to give neighbouring States time to complete
their organization, and also to afford a delay which may result in
some diminution of the virulence of the epidemic.”


The Government of the Commonwealth, and of each of the States,
formally notified their acceptance of these resolutions, and they were adopted
hy unanimous consent as the basis of action in the event of any epidemic
occurring within any one State.
Nothing transpired to interfere with the acceptance of these resolutions
until the appearance of cases in Melbourne, when it was found that, at the
first test, the accord which had been attained at this Conference was broken
down, and conflict arose.
The first known case of influenza in Melbourne occurred on or about
10th January ; other cases had been declared, and official cognisance of the
fact of influenza being present in Melbourne was admitted by the Health
Department on 23rd January, on which date an informal conference with
the Director of Quarantine and his staff was held by the State health
authorities.
It is provided by resolution 3 of the Conference that the Chief Health
Officer of any State should immediately notify to the Director of Quarantine
the presence of any case of “pneumonic influenza in his State. This
notification was received from the Chief Health Officer, Victoria, by the
Director of Quarantine on 28th January, on which date the proclamation
was issued, proclaiming under the Quarantine Act that —
(1) the State of Victoria is infected with a quarantinable disease, to
wit, pneumonic influenza, and is a place from or through which
the said quarantinable disease may be brought or carried to
other parts of Australia ;
(2) such State shall be a quarantine area ;
(3) all persons and goods in such quarantine area shall be subject to
quarantine.
Prior to this date, however, on or about 21st January, a traveller from
Melbourne had been located in Sydney suffering from a definite attack of
influenza, and several other persons had been infected from this original
case. These cases being considered by the New South Wales health
authorities sufficient to justify them in taking action under resolution 3,
notification had been received by the Director of Quarantine from the
Director General of Public Health in New South Wales that there was a
c ase of “ pneumonic influenza ”in that State, and accordingly a proclamation
pad been issued on 27th January proclaiming the State of Now South Wales
a s infected.
At this point serious divergencies arose in the practice of the various
State Governments from the provisions of the resolutions of the November
Conference.
The New South Wales Government, instead of giving effect to the terms
of resolution 4, considered that all traffic by land should be suspended, and
that traffic by sea should be governed by the condition that any vessel
arriving in Sydney from Victorian ports should not have communication
with the shore until 96 hours had elapsed since the departure of the vessel
from the last Victorian port. This action was taken without any repre-
sentations being made to the Commonwealth that the State Government
did not intend to abide by the terms of resolution 4 of the Conference.


Queensland Government notified that it did not intend to abide by the
proviso in resolution 4 relating to persons residing within 10 miles of the
border, and that the border would be absolutely closed.
The. Western Australian Government seized the Commonwealth Trans-
continental train and detained that for several days’ quarantine, notwith-
standing that the passengers on that train had left Victoria before the latter
State was proclaimed, and were not, therefore, liable under the Quarantine
Act to any restrictions.
This action was repeated with the succeeding train, and led to entire
suspension of the train traffic on that line.
All of these actions were taken without intimation to the Commonwealth
Government that such was intended, and consequently it became impossible
for the Commonwealth Government to continue a pretence at controlling
traffic when State Governments each day were imposing new restrictions
without reference to, or consultation with, the Commonwealth Government.
This was clear and distinct violation of resolution 5 of the Conference, to
which all Governments had agreed, and accordingly the Commonwealth
Government decided to notify the State Governments that it withdrew from
its adhesion to the resolutions of the November Conference.
At the request of Tasmania, however, it continued to control traffic by
sea with that State.
The restrictions were constantly changing in each State. In some cases
traffic was being obstructed without legal authority, and it was impossible
for definite statement to be obtained regarding the conditions applying to
Inter-State traffic as between the various States. When every State had
finally determined its policy, the position was as follows :■ —
Queensland. —Persons were not permitted to cross the border except at
Wallangarra, a border station on the main railway line, and at this
point a quarantine detention of seven days in a canvas camp had
to be performed by travellers. Ships arriving from infected States
had to lie at anchor in the bay until completion of seven clear days
since their departure from the last infected Australian port.
New South Wales. —At first permitted no traffic whatever across the
border by land, subsequently a form of quarantine detention camp,
in which persons had to pass four days, was adopted at one or two
points, a system of permit for local traffic being adopted elsewdiere.
Vessels arriving from infected States were required to anchor in the
harbor until four clear days had elapsed since departure from last
infected Australian port.
Victoria. —Applied no restrictions against any State.
South Australia.- -Maintained an absolute blockade against Victorian
traffic by land, with at first a provision for admission after seven days*
border quarantine, for which neither Victoria nor South Australia
made any provision in the shape of camp or other conveniences.
Regulation of traffic by sea was left to the Commonwealth.
Western Australia. —After its initial seizure and detention of trains,
prohibited all traffic by land from other States, and by sea required
the completion of seven clear days since departure from last infected
Australian port.


Tasmania. —Required seven days’ quarantine detention, either before
departure or on arrival in Tasmania.
These conditions persisted until the control of traffic between other States
and South Australia was handed over to the Commonwealth by agreement
on 6th February, 1919. The Commonwealth intervened, and took control
of traffic between other States and 'New South Wales on 16th April, 1919,
and took control of traffic between Queensland and other States on 19th
May.
While the Commonwealth had, admittedly, the constitutional and legal
power to take control of the traffic between the above-mentioned States at a
date prior to that mentioned, yet it was considered unwise to force Common-
wealth control until it had been abundantly demonstrated that the State
policy had failed to effect its ostensible purpose, viz., to keep the State con-
cerned free from influenza infection.
The experience gained as a result of this extensive test of so-called Inter-
State quarantine has been illuminating in many directions.
Many difficulties were encountered, and ultimately the control of border
traffic proved to be impracticable. The evasions of the restrictions were
very numerous, persons crossing at points where there was no supervision in
large numbers. In fact, it has been established that there was, at certain
points between New South Wales and Victoria, a regularly constituted
traffic, whereby j>ersons were smuggled across the border at points at which
there was no regular supervision of Inter-State traffic.
There were numerous cases of hardship, in which persons living on one side
of the border drew their supplies from a point on the other side of the border
at a short distance, and such ludicrous occasions are recorded as that of a
dairy farmer being not permitted to cross the road, which formed the border
at that point, to milk his cows which were on the other side of the road.
Not only has it to be recorded that, as a matter of practical administration,
border control failed to prevent large numbers of persons crossing the border,
but clearly also, as the epidemic became well established in South Australia,
New South Wales, and Queensland at comparatively short intervals after its
establishment in Victoria, it failed in its primary purpose of protecting the
States which imposed these restrictions.
Such a result could have been confidently predicted by any person with
experience of Inter-State quarantine and its difficulties, particularly in the case
of a disease like influenza, and was so predicted by the Commonwealth
representatives at the November Conference.
The main and determining point of difference between maritime quarantine
and Inter-State quarantine being that maritime quarantine deals with vessels
entirely under control—no other traffic being possible—while Inter-State
quarantine has to face the difficulty of traffic at many hundred points along a
border hundreds of miles long.
The position as it had to be faced on the declaration of cases in Victoria
in January was that the fact of an influenza epidemic prevalent in Melbourne
was due to either—
(a) the escape of infection from the maritime quarantine defence ; or
(h) the continuity of the epidemic which was prevalent during the
latter months of 1918.


Obviously, in the latter alternative, Inter-State quarantine would be
applied much too late to have any effective result ; in the former alternative
it must be admitted on deliberate consideration that, as maritime quarantine
had applied such very careful measures as daily thermometer parade,
inhalation, inoculation and isolation of cases and suspected cases, if it proved
unsuccessful in these cases, when every single person entering the Com-
monwealth was under observation, then a system of Inter-State control, which
could not and did not deal with more than a portion of the persons passing
between the States, which made no attempt at daily medical examination,
or the application of the other measures quoted, could not, in reason, be
expected to prove successful.
For a considerable period land quarantine stations were maintained by
the New South Wales and Queensland Governments at the point where the
main trunk line between the capitals crossed the border. It is claimed for
these that no case was recorded in these camps during the whole time that
they were in use.
These camps, therefore, must be judged upon this basis, and it is
clear, if no case occurred during the whole period of continuity of these
camps, that they served no good purpose, for it would be necessary, if it
were desired to show that these camps had achieved some valuable result,
to show that they had actually excluded some person who would otherwise
have been a danger to the community towards which they were travelling.
As it is stated that no such case occurred, it must be clear that the camps
achieved no good purpose in this direction.
If, on the other hand, cases were overlooked or suppressed, or if infection
was introduced by persons evading these camps, then clearly the camps
must be considered to be more vicious than useful.
As numerous cases of influenza were detected on ships arriving in Sydney
or in Brisbane in the period during which it is claimed that no case occurred
amongst travellers by land passing through these camps, it is difficult to
understand the immunity enjoyed by these camps.
These camps must be judged upon the decision in respect of two important
considerations—
(a) Did they achieve a useful purpose in protecting the State con-
cerned from infection by the disease in question ?
(h) Was the cost, in terms of entire dislocation of national commerce,
justified by the result achieved ?
There will be no doubt in the mind of any unprejudiced person as to the
answer which should be given to these two questions in the light of the
experience gained in the administration of these camps.
The position taken up by the Commonwealth Government in respect of
this question of land quarantine may be briefly stated as follows -
“ It was, at the outset, recognised to be impracticable to control
border traffic completely, that is to say, to insure by any possible
means short of complete armed military patrol along the border,
that no person crossed the border except under supervision.”
That being so, the whole scheme of border control must be determined
by the fact that it is necessarily incomplete.


Land quarantine stations were recognised by those having any experience
of quarantine administration to be inevitably, either a useless infliction on
persons travelling, or a positive danger, not only to the travellers, but to-
the community concerned. This fact has been so well established by a long
experience that the International Sanitary Convention, which prescribed
the principles of quarantine now adopted by all countries, laid it down
emphatically in 1912 at the International Conference signed at Paris, 1912,
that “ land quarantine must not be resorted to.”
That being so, and in view of the natural history of the disease, the
Commonwealth Government has throughout urged that only certain measures
are practicable, and that these measures are, so far as land traffic is concerned,
restricted by practicability to a medical supervision of persons travelling
by rapid means of transit between States, and that, although risk may be
involved, it is idle to attempt anything more than control of traffic by these
means.
In respect of a disease like influenza, however, the risk involved must be
considered to be small. The incubation period is so short that a person
would be a declared patient, and probably unable to travel before he reached
or crossed the border by any means of travel other than motor car or railway
train, and as motor service—except local around the borders—is comparatively
rare, in practice it becomes practicable to deal only with railway traffic on
main trunk lines between States.
This is all that the Commonwealth has attempted, and nothing in the
experience of the past months has indicated that this offers any greater risk
to the community than the methods adopted by the States, which were unsuc-
cessful in preventing a widespread outbreak of the disease in at least three of
the States adopting these measures.
The scheme adopted by the Commonwealth Quarantine Service requires
a person to report for medical examination during 48 hours before his departure
from the State ; to be examined by an officer of the Quarantine Service on
the train before the completion of his journey, and to report after arrival
at the point of destination to either—
(a) a quarantine officer, or .
(b) a State medical officer of health,
for three successive days, immediate isolation being effected if any symptoms
of influenza declare themselves at any inspection.
These measures represent what must ultimately come to be the complete
system of co-ordination of Commonwealth and State powers, in the presence
of an epidemic threatening all States, viz., the Commonwealth controlling
main principles and main administrative functions, but dovetailing with the
State administration, enabling them to rely upon the efficiency of the State
health machinery for the control of such casual cases of disease which may
escape through the system of defence adopted.
Maritime traffic between States is necessarily conditioned throughout by
the limitations on the control of land traffic. It would be obviously unreason-
able to apply more severe restrictions to traffic by sea than by land, unless it
can be shown that sea traffic affords some special epidemiological conditions


which involve greater risk. This has not been demonstrated, and it is, there-
fore, a reasonable thesis that sea traffic should not be subject to greater
restrictions than land traffic. That being so, detention for observation
would not be justified in the case of States having free land communication,
and in actual practice no event arose which negatived this attitude.
There were, however, two vessels which have been frequently cited as
instances of the unreliability of the scheme of control put forward by the
Commonwealth Quarantine Service. These are two vessels, Argyllshire
and Wyandra (Noe. 10 and 7, Table D), the circumstances in respect of which
have been related on page 42, and it is sufficient here to say that the subse-
quent history is sufficient proof that nothing occurred presenting any risk
to the State, which would not have been entirely covered by the application
of the system of control adopted by the Commonwealth.
With regard to Tasmania, which has no land communications with the
mainland, the conditions are practically those of maritime quarantine.
It has been sufficiently demonstrated in these pages that the incubation
period is, in every case of sea travel, less than four days —being in the vast
majority of cases two days —and in point of fact there is nothing in all the
experience of the past six months’ control of ship epidemics to negative the
attitude that the seven-day period insisted upon by the State of Tasmania
is unnecessarily long, and that, given efficient State health administration
so that immediate isolation of cases amongst persons reporting under sur-
veillance can be affected, there is no reason why the scheme put forward by
the Commonwealth Quarantine Service should not afford ample protection
to the State of Tasmania. However, as the State Government was emphatic
in its insistence upon the requirements, and as evidence that the State of
Tasmania is infected with influenza is not forthcoming, no action has yet
been taken by the Commonwealth.
Western Australia. —In order to secure the continuation of land traffic, a
scheme was devised whereby passengers undergo detention in land quarantine
stations, and passengers by sea must complete seven clear days before being
allowed to land in Western Australia, this latter provision being required
by the State and not by the Commonwealth Quarantine Service.
The experience of control of an epidemic within Australia during the past
six months has been valuable and illuminating. It has been in many respects
a serious warning of what might be expected to occur in the presence of a
disastrously fatal epidemic, and in the presence of an epidemic such as plague
or cholera, the conditions of control of which are more accurately known than
in the case of influenza.
The principal difficulties encountered during the past six months have
been, firstly, that the State GdvernmehtA'having adhered to an agreement
departed from that agreement without notice to the Commonwealth or to the
other parties to the agreement ; that the Commonwealth is unable under
existing circumstances to take initiatory action to proclaim a State as infected,
and to launch the necessary measures on that basis, in as much as it is necessary
to wait upon any State for knowledge of the existence of the disease under
consideration.


While the Commonwealth has power to proclaim a State of its own
initiative, yet such proclamation must be based upon knowledge in three
directions—first, knowledge of the existence of the disease in question ;
second, knowledge of the number of cases ; and third, knowledge of the
presence of the disease in epidemic form.
For full and complete knowledge in any one of these directions, first-hand
information is necessary, and such information can only be obtained either
by complete and immediate disclosure by the State concerned of all knowledge
in its possession, or by the Commonwealth actually collecting the information
by its own officers.
The difficulties in connexion with the control of this epidemic were very
materially enhanced by the attitude of portion of the daily press, which
adopted and forced upon the public a panic attitude which has not, at any
time, been justified by the events, and adopted a sensationalism which seized
every occasional incident to increase the public apprehension. In some
States, moreover, the control of the situation was taken out of the hands of
the professional advisers and placed in the hands of committees with very
little experience in control of epidemics.
The experiences of the past six months have rendered it abundantly clear
that the control of epidemics is a particular branch of the science of medicine,
requiring as much special experience as any other section of medicine, and
requiring considerably more knowledge of administration generally than
commonly is the experience of the medical profession.
It may be said, beyond possibility of discussion, that many of the mistakes
that have been made on a large scale in the past six months in Australia,
and much of the interference with individual comfort and national trade
might have been avoided had those who were framing the policy adopted
by the various States either possessed themselves, or relied upon those
who could supply them with, knowledge of the laws of epidemics and the
behaviour of influenza as recorded during the last three centuries, and of the
administration and technical difficulties of requiring a large population,
scattered over thousands of square miles, to comply with requirements which
may seem practicable during academic discussion, or which may even be
practicable under the controlled conditions existing on Quarantine Stations.


CHAPTER VII.
INFLUENZA VACCINE AND INOCULATION.
BY W. J. PENFOLD, M.B., D.P.H.,
Chief Quarantine Officer,
Laboratory Division.
Introduction.
Nature of present Epidemic. —Official reports from New Zealand, South
Africa, and the English medical press reports indicated that B. influenza i
(Pfeiffer) was commonly present in the influenza cases. The deaths, however,
were due chiefly to pneumococcal and streptococcal respiratory complications.
It had been known for some years before the occurrence of the present epidemic
that feverish cold could be produced by some filter-passing organism, and it
had been frequently suggested that the classical influenza might also be due
to some such organism. This question is not yet settled ; many writers still
affirm that B. influenzee (Pfeiffer) is the essential cause of the disease. It may
be that these two views are not so antagonistic as they look. The B. influenzee
is very small, and might well have forms which would pass the filters used
in many of the investigations which have been described. The detailed
bacteriological findings from the various by the disease
stated that not only were B. influenzee (Pfeiffer), the pneumococcus and various
types of streptococcus isolated from the sputa of the cases, or from post-
mortem material, but that the M. catarrhalis and a gram-positive diplococcus,
unlike the pneumococcus, had also commonly been found. We determined,
therefore, to endeavour to provide a vaccine containing these organisms.
The work of Wilson suggesting that the disease was due to a small filter-
passing coccus had not then been published.
In January, 1919, Dr. McMcekin, Superintendent of the Melbourne
Hospital, applied to the laboratories for media suitable for the growth of
B. influenzee, and cooked blood-agar slopes were supplied. These slopes were
inoculated with sputum from suspected cases. I had the opportunity of
examining these inoculated slopes after 24 hours incubation, and found that
several of them contained bacilli indistinguishable from B. influenzee. Dr.
McMcekin was good enough to supply me with specimens of sputum, and
from two of these a gram-negative ha)mophilic organism unable to grow on
ordinary agar was cultivated. This organism agreed in morphological and
cultural respects with B. influenzee.
The rest of the bacterial flora found included pneumococci (virulent and
non-virulent), streptococci of various types, M. catarrhalis, and gram-positive
diplococci of similar morphological and cultural characters. Table F gives
in tabular form a resume of the results of the examination of sputum and
naso-pharyngeal swabs from cases of influenza occurring before and during
the present epidemic.

Remarks .— The cases died in the Melbourne and Alfred Hospitals. All
were definite pneumonic influenza except “ P. 1,” which the pathologist
believed to be ordinary lobar pneumonia without influenza. The bacteriology
of six organs was studied in each case, viz., lung, pleura, pericardium, bronchial
glands, spleen, and heart. The pneumococcus was found in nearly all of the
six organs in each of the above cases. The bacillus influenzae, though found
in four out of six cases of undoubted influenza, was not widely present
throughout the body. In “I. 23 ”it was found in pleural and pericardial
fluids only ; in “I. 27 in the lung only ; in “1.28 ” in the lungs, bronchial
glands, and spleen ; and in “1.30 ” in the spleen only. These results indicate
that negative findings in respect of B. influenzae to have any value must be
based on an extensive search of the different organs. It is also interesting
to note that material from three organs from two cases which gave positive
results when plated out on cooked blood-agar plates gave only negative
results on ordinary blood-agar plates. The streptococcus isolated from
“I- 23 was present in the lung, where it was the prevailing organism, and
a few colonies of it occurred on the plate from the spleen in an otherwise
pure plate of the pneumococcus.
The post-mortem findings differ from those of Dr. McMeekin (A.M.J., 15th
March, 1919, page 209) in that he found a greater variety of organisms
than we did, though he only examined the lungs and we examined material
from six organs. In taking portions from the lung we always avoided
large bronchi. The identity of our strains was determined on the follow-
ing basis :
The pneumococcus was taken as a gram-positive lanceolate diplococcus
which in direct smears of the body fluids showed a marked capsule. Some
forms of the organism were single and ovoid, and some were elongated and
C. 8662.-6


inclined to be almost rod-like ; in culture the capsule was not so marked
When grown on blood-agar, if the blood was not present in too great a
quantity, the colonies were distinctly green when viewed by transmitted
light, and showed a marked green halo. On the first day they appeared as
moist reflecting droplike colonies, and by the second or third day they usually
showed a marked flattening, with the typical ringed appearance of the
pneumococcal colony. On blood-agar plates, with a larger quantity of blood,
the greenish colour was much darker and was marked by a greyish tint. On
cooked blood agar the pneumococcus gave a slightly smaller colony than on
fresh blood agar. It was green in colour and showed a dark edge round ic.
After it had grown for two or three days a khaki colour developed on and
around the colony the blood being bleached. The sugar reactions were
positive in glucose, saccharose, maltose, galactose, and dextrin serum water
and negative in mannite dulcite, and amygdalin. Unfortunately no inulin
was procurable. All the strains isolated from the body 'post-mortem, and from
blood cultures, were bile soluble, while only 66 per cent, of those isolated
from the sputum and nasopharyngeal swabs were bile soluble, the remainder
being insoluble (Neufeld’s test). Attempts have been made to classify the
pneumococci isolated by anti-sera made in Australian rabbits, but up to the
present the results have been unsatisfactory. We have no supply of
European rabbits available for this purpose. Animal tests for virulence
have not been done with the pneumococci because we had so few white mice
that we did not feel that we should use them.
The B. influenza was identified by its morphology, accepting the
bacillus as a short gram-negative rod, not easily stained with the ordinary
aniline stains, but easily stained with dilute carbol fuchsin, having delicate
filamentous forms from time to time, growing on uncooked blood agar as
discrete dew-droplike colonies, refusing to grow on ordinary agar growing
with a luxuriant smear on cooked blood agar. If the cooked blood had a.
fair amount of condensation water, the growth at the bottom of the tube
became very thick. The organism was noticed to grow much more luxui -
iantly in the neighbourhood of pneumococcal colonies, especially if the
uncooked blood agar on which it was grown was a little old. In one or two
cases, on plating out material on ordinary blood agar, influenza colonies
came up around the individual pneumococcal colonies and were not found
on the plate after 24 hours’ growth in any other position. We believe that in.
examining material for the influenza bacillus direct from the body the most
favorable medium for the bacillus should be employed. We prefer cooked
blood agar.
The Streptococci grew as a rule as small discrete colonies, many of the
long streptococci showed diplococcal arrangement, frequently reminding one
of the pneumococcus • others showed chains of organisms in which the long
axis of the individual was transverse to the long axis of the streptococcus.
They grew as long chains in broth. This was specially marked in the case
of the streptococcus hiemolyticus.
The Gram-positive Diplococcus. —On serum agar the colonies appeared
first of all more or less like meningococcus colonies, and the amount of growt h
diminished on subculture ; both on serum and on blood agar the original


growth was more luxuriant than in the case of the meningococcus. The
organism grew very profusely in glucose broth. Morphologically, it
showed diplococcal forms and also short streptococcal forms. It had no
action whatever on blood agar. On blood agar the growth frequently
appeared with a fine morocco leatherlike surface.
The Micrococcus catarrhalis. —A gram-negative diplococcus showing a
marked tendency to clump. The fermentation tests on glucose were negative.
In endeavouring to make a suitable vaccine in November, 1918, we could
not include B. influenza, as we had not isolated it; we therefore made a
coryza vaccine in the first instance of the following composition :—“ A
strength, M. catarrhalis, 25 millions; pneumococcus, 10 millions; streptococcus,
10 millions; gram-positive diplococcus (not the pneumococcus), 10 millions;
“ B ” strength, five times the quantities of each organism contained in the
“A ” strength. This vaccine we replaced in December by an influenza vaccine
when the first B. influenza strains arrived from the Chief Quarantine Officer,
Western Australia. The influenza vaccine was made in two strengths of the
following composition:—
“A” strength per c.c.

The doses we employed in our vaccines did not differ materially from those
suggested by the English Committee appointed to consider the advisability
of prophylactic vaccination. The findings of this Committee did not reach
us till sometime after our vaccines had been issued. No extensive work on
prophylaxis with such a vaccine had been done. The pneumococcus alone
had been used by Lister in South Africa in the prophylaxis of pneumonia
(not influenzial pneumonia) with good results. In this case the doses given
were very large. Several things militated against the use of large doses :
(a) It is not easy to produce the great volume of growth. Lister
could not produce 40,000 doses of his vaccine on short notice.
(h) Our vaccine had to contain several organisms.
(c) There is no convincing evidence that such large doses are needful.
Cole and Moore (1917), J. of Exp. Med. Vol. XXVI., pp. 537-561, showed
that the injection of pneumococci from 18 c.c. of culture gave a better anti-
body (agglutinin) response in the rabbit than the injection of the pneumococci


from 1,000 c.c. of culture. Henderson Smith, in his work on dosage in the
case of typhoid vaccine, found that small doses gave relatively large amounts
of antibodies. The most desirable vaccine seems to be the one of minimum
dose which will protect the individual effectually. Unfortunately, very
little work on this point is to be found yi the literature. Further, any
persons suffering from chronic infections with any of the organisms contained
in the vaccine might on inoculation give a general and focal reaction of consider-
able severity. Many factors, therefore, caused a small dose to be recom-
mended as a first dose. Such a dose, it was hoped, would immunize to some
extent, and it would enable the doctor to ascertain if any specific susceptibility
existed in the person being vaccinated. Quite marked reactions may occur
with a dose of 25 million streptococci in persons suffering from a chronic
streptococcal infection, so that a small first dose of a vaccine containing so
many constituents seemed necessary. In cases not reacting too severely the
second dose of five times the quantity was to be given.
Pneumococcal Types. —Lister, in his work in South Africa, included in
his vaccines various type strains. The Australian pneumococci never had
been classified, so that Lister’s method was not possible in Australia at the
inception of this epidemic. Pneumococci isolated from local cases of influenza
and others isolated from cases of Spanish influenza as it occurred in the
quarantine cases were therefore combined in the Commonwealth vaccines,
which were made highly polyvalent. The polyvalent vaccine appears to be a
good substitute for the typed vaccine, since one can be fairly sure of having
the prevalent types of penuniococci represented in it ; while in the case of
the typed vaccine serious results have apparently occurred through not having
the prevailing type in the vaccine. B. influenzae was first isolated in the
quarantined cases by Dr. Atkinson, Commissioner of Public Health in Western
Australia, and his strains, together with the strains from the Sydney Quarantine
Station material, were added to the coryza vaccine, which was then called influ-
enza vaccine. Several criticisms have been launched against the introduction
of this organism into the vaccine, the first one alleged that it did not give
rise to antibodies in the animal body ; this has been amply disproved by the
scientific work done during this epidemic. The second one was that a negative
phase of increased susceptibility to attack might be induced if the patient
were exposed to infection. The negative phase, as a rule, has been determined
from a consideration of antibody, more especially opsonin, content of the
serum, and very little evidence has been forthcoming in the case of prophy-
lactic vaccination in man to favour the view that it was a serious danger.
Haffkine’s evidence to this effect in the case of cholera appeared to be so
slight as to be negligible, while Rowland showed that actual immunity could
be demonstrated after plague vaccination in rats 24 hours after the inoculation.
These and other similar considerations seemed sufficient to enable us to set
aside the alleged danger of the negative phase, and accordingly B. influenzae
was incorporated in the vaccine.
The actual sources of materials used in the production of the different
harvests of organisms for our vaccines are set out in Table H. hrom the

All the above harvests can be identifled by referring to Table H. The exact composition of any
batch of vaccine can thus be at once ascertained.
Media.
Methods of Preparation. —In the first instance all the strains were grown
on serum agar, except B. infiuenzoe, which was grown on blood agar. It was
soon found that these media were quite unequal to giving the quantity of
growth which was required. This applied especially to the pneumococcus and
B. infiuenzoe. After some preliminary experimentation it was decided to
grow the pneumoccocus, streptococcus, and gram-positive diplococcus on
glucose broth ; the difference this made to the volume of growth was enormous.
Similar results occurred in the case of B. infiuenzoe when the blood agar of
Pfeiffer was replaced by cooked citrated horse blood agar. Fitzgerald and
Cohen (5) had already shown that B. infiuenzoe gave a larger colony when
grown on cooked rabbit blood agar. This observation caused us to try
■cooked citrated horse blood agar for the growth of our influenza vaccine
harvests, with very good results. It met all requirements.


Composition of Media used for Growth of Vaccine and for
Examination of Material.
Extract of bullock’s heart or veal was used as the basis of all media em-
ployed in the vaccine. The extract was prepared by mincing the meat (fat
and muscle removed from the bullock’s heart) and adding 1,000 c.c. of distilled
water per kilogram. This was allowed to stand at 34° F. over night. Next
morning the temperature was raised gradually to 100° C. and allowed to
boil for fifteen minutes. The extract was then separated from the meat by
pressing through a sieve and filtering. Volume of extract was made up to
twice the original volume of water taken by the addition of distilled water.
Peptone Broth was prepared from the extract by the addition of 1 per
cent, peptone (Fairchild’s) ando - 5 per cent, sodium chloride, and the re-
action adjusted ; filtered and sterilized by steaming.
Agar was prepared by adding to the peptone broth shredded agar to
3 per cent., and filtering through Chardin paper after clearing with egg,
and readjustment of reaction if necessary.
Serum Agar. —To the 3 per cent, agar, bottled and sterilized, 10 per cent,
of sterile normal horse serum was added while the agar was melted at 45° C. ;
it was then mixed well and allowed to set
Blood Agar was made as serum agar, except that 10 per cent, of citrated
horse blood was added instead of serum.
Citrated Horse Blood. —The blood was collected directly through a sterile
canula from the jugular vein of the horse into a receiving bottle containing
one part of 16 per cent, sodium citrate in distilled water. Blood was added
to make up ten parts, the bottle being shaken well all the time. The receiving
bottle was fitted with a syphon tube, to which was attached a measuring
burette and a filling pipette, for measuring out and distributing the 10 c.c.
of blood to each Roux bottle as required. The sterility of the blood was
verified by incubating the blood-agar medium before using.
Cooked Blood Agar was made in the same way as blood agar, except that
the blood was added to the agar at 60° C. and cooked by placing in a water
bath at 80° C. for ten minutes.
Glucose Broth was prepared by the addition of 2 per c4nt. or 2| per cent,
glucose to the peptone broth, and sterilizing on three successive days in
the steamer (discontinuous method).
Our method of making the vaccine after plating out and identifying the
strains is to grow the organism in question on serum or blood agar in Roux
bottles or on glucose broth in flasks. Each Roux bottle is incubated 24 hours,
the growth is then washed off with saline, a smear is stained by Gram’s method
to see if any contamination can be found. When all the Roux bottles examined
are found to be free from contamination to be detected by this method, the
saline emulsions are then collected. These emulsions are then passed through
two bottles for breaking up clumps in the emulsions ; the harvest is then
passed through a cotton wool filter (Fig. 1,D.) to remove residual clumps and so
into the harvest bottle; this contains a volume of 0-8 per cent, tricresol equal


to the volume of the harvest collected, giving a final concentration of 04 per
cent, tricresol. This mixture on standing was found to become sterile after a few
Fig. I.-Harvest Collecting Apparatus for Agar-Roux Bottle Growths.
hours. The counting of the vaccine is done by the
dark-ground method before sterilization with tricresol.
This method is employed for the production of the
M. calarrhalis and B. influenzce harvests. In the
case of the pneumococcus, the streptococcus, and
gram-positive diplococcus, the harvest is collected
directly from the glucose broth flasks and passed
through the breaking up bottles and then into
the sterilizing bottle. In the case of the B. influenzce
and the M. catarrhalis harvests the distribution of
saline into Roux bottles and the collection of the
vaccine is done by syphonage. A sterile, container
(Fig. 1.,b) containing the saline is fitted with rubber
tubing, and a long glass tube with glass shield
(Fig. 1., a), these are autoclaved and the saline
distributed by syphonage amongst the Roux bottles.
After washing off the growth the emulsion is collected
into the same saline bottle. The bacterial emulsion
is broken up in the breaking up bottles B and C
shown in Figure (I.), and is then passed into the
harvest bottle, where it is stored (see Figure II.).
These diagrams are self-explanatory. -
Having got the harvests and ascertained the
sterility, suitable fractions of the different harvests
Fig. II. —Stock-bottle for Standardized
Stock Emulsions.
are mixed in sterile bottles and then added to 18-litre bottles of sterilized and
tricresolized saline, from which bottles the distribution into containers occurs.


Sterility Tests are used to Control the Technique.
Sterilization of the Vaccine. —In the Australian Medical Journal it was
stated that all the Commonwealth Serum Laboratory vaccines would be
sterilized by tricresol ; this has been our practice since the opening of the
institute. About one year later the Hygienic Laboratory, Washington,
U.S.A., published a report by one of its workers, who tested tricresol
sterilization against heat sterilization in the case of typhoid vaccine. He found
the tricresol killed vaccine of definitely greater antigenic power. Our method
had been adopted from two considerations —(1) in typhoid vaccine the
killing by heat is not necessary, since the added antiseptic is more than
sufficient to kill ; (2) d’Herrelle, of the Pasteur Institute, found the antiseptic-
killed vaccine in the case of fowl cholera infection in rabbits quite excellent as
a protective, while the heat-killed vaccine was useless. (Personal communi-
cation.) It seems therefore reasonable to assume that the doses of the
different antigens in the coryza and influenza vaccines of these laboratories
were considerably larger than those indicated by the mere numbers of the
organisms.
Output of Vaccines. —The output of vaccines is indicated in Figure 4
of Mr. Cherry’s paper. The ordinates indicate 1,000 doses, and abscissse the
days of issue.
Difficulties. —The laboratory buildings, Royal Park, had only been opened
three months when the epidemic came upon us. The technical staff was
small, and some members of it only partially trained. It was necessary to
adopt the principle of the dilution of labour, so that the maximum could be
got our of the skilled workers. In meeting the demands of public authorities
and private consumers of the vaccine, quantity of autoclaving space, size of
plant to produce distilled water, shortage of personnel, and even size of
building, all became in turn limiting factors of our output.
Notwithstanding these difficulties, a total of 3,000,000 doses of vaccine
for influenza was prej>ared and distributed between 15th October, 1918, and
15th March, 1919.
Only one complaint concerning the quality of the vaccine was received at
the laboratories. A surgeon returned a bottle as being contaminated ; he
believed it was contaminated as delivered from the laboratories. His evidence
in favour of that conclusion was not satisfactory, however. After a careful
examination of the vaccine returned we found it to be contaminated with a
sporing rod ; it contained less than 100 living organisms per c.c. The
contamination after cultivation resisted boiling for fifteen minutes. Three
control samples from the same batch of vaccine were found to be quite sterile,
showing that the batch was sterile. The vaccine therefore appeared to have
been contaminated either after issue or in the process of bottling here. We
had great difficulty in accepting the latter alternative, as we employ a very
careful technique. The case is, however, instructive, as showing how such a
contamination may explain anomalous reactions. In Chart A the tempera-
ture curves of two rabbits respectively inoculated with the uncontaminated
and contaminated vaccine are shown. It is desirable to bring this case
forward to forcibly indicate the need for very prolonged boiling of instruments,
if possible in freshly distilled water, and the observation of every care on the

part not only of the staff here, who make the vaccine, but also on the part of
the doctors outside who administer it. Such extra severe reactions might
be interpreted as mild influenza due to a marked negative phase, while
in reality they only indicate imperfect technique somewhere.
The Value of the Vaccine.
(1) The Value of the Vaccine in respect of Prevention of the Disease.
In determining the question of the value of the vaccine as a prophylactic,
we have only one set of figures which is efficiently controlled. These figures
were supplied to us by the Victorian Eailway Authorities, and refer to their
employees in the metropolitan and suburban areas. The period over which
the observations extended was from 24th January, 1919, to 7th March, 1919,
that is to say, a period of exactly six weeks. The number of employees
inoculated once was 745, the number of employees inoculated twice was
4,410, while the number of employees not inoculated was 6,247. The numbers
in these various groups who contracted the disease were as follow :
61 in the group once inoculated.
95 in the group twice inoculated.
252 in the uninoculated group.
Calculated out on a percentage basis, we find that 8-2 per cent, of the
once inoculated contracted the disease, 2• 1 per cent, of those inoculated on
two occasions, and 4 per cent, of those who were not inoculated.
At first sight it would appear that the incidence was markedly higher in
those inoculated on one occasion only, and that instead of the vaccine having
conferred any protection, it had only rendered the individual more susceptible
to the disease. A little thought, however, will immediately convince us that
that interpretation is quite illegitimate. The 4,410 persons who were
inoculated twice would of necessity pass through the stage of being once
inoculated persons ; that stage would last one week in each case, so that we
have 4,410 weeks of exposure of this group as once inoculated persons. Since
the observations were continued for six weeks, this is equivalent to the
exposure of 735 persons for six weeks, so that in calculating our percentage
in the once inoculated group we must add 745 who were once inoculated
during the whole period to 735, which represents the fraction of time that the
doubly inoculated were exposed as once inoculated persons. This, therefore,
brings the once inoculated group up to 1,480. If the percentage incidence
be now calculated on this group, the incidence works out at 4-1 per cent.,
while in the uninoculated group it works out at 4-03 per cent. ; that is to
say, we have practical identity between these two groups. This necessitates
a correction in respect of the doubly inoculated group. Instead of having
4,410 persons exposed during six weeks we have 4,410 persons exposed during
five weeks, or an equivalent of 3,675 during six weeks. If now we work out
a fresh percentage on this basis we find that the incidence amongst the doubly
inoculated was in reality 2-5 per cent. We conclude, therefore, that during
the period immediately following the first dose, when the inoculated population
was only once inoculated, there was not any increased risk of infection, while


during the period when the inoculated were doubly inoculated the risk of
infection was only five-eighths of the risk amongst the uninoculated.
Maynard found that Wright’s early vaccine work against pneumonia in
South Africa diminished the risk of attack in the ratio of approximately
eight to six, while our railway figures show a reduction of eight to five.
Figures supplied by Fleet Surgeon C. C. Bean, of the Navy Department,
collected by Surgeon Lieut.-Commander Ramsay Smith, and Surgeon
Lieut.-Commander Temple Grey, show that the whole population—s43—of
the Naval Depot was inoculated at one time, but since there was no control
population at risk the figures cannot be used to determine the effect of
inoculation on incidence.
The conclusions of Surgeon Lieut.-Commander Grey on the effect of the
coryza vaccine on incidence of influenza are set forth in his paper in the
Australian Medical Journal of 12th April, 1919. These results seem to be
very different from the results obtained from analyzing the railway figures;
He claims that inoculation will enormously decrease the incidence of the
disease. The evidence he adduces in favour of his conclusion is very striking.
It was not, however, properly controlled. If, for example, the 40 natives of
Pago Pago had not all been inoculated but only half of them, and if then the
whole 40 had been released, the occurrence of the disease in the respective
fractions of population would have given us more information. Instead of
that, the only control given us from which we can make a judgment is that
about this time one-fifth of the population of the island died of the disease.
It seems improbable that the absolute immunity from the disease of these
40 natives could have been a matter of chance, but the degree of infectivity
of the disease at the precise moment of the release of the natives is left in
doubt. Similarly in the case of all the naval results recorded by Grey,
though not one of them is a rigidly controlled experiment, still they all suggest
an immunity of a very high degree. It appears (personal communication)
that some of these populations with which Grey dealt in his paper subse-
quently developed influenza. The disease, however, was of such a very mild
type as to indicate that a large measure of protection still existed in the
population. Accepting then as probable that Grey did confer a con-
siderably greater immunity than the railway employees showed, the question
then arises—whence this difference ? It may lie in the method of inoculation
employed by Grey. His first inoculations were done with “B ’’ vaccine,
so that he gave five times the recommended dose for the first dose. Further,
he repeated his inoculations up to four and even more times in the course of
three months. His protective work, therefore, differs from the railway
work, chiefly in the fact that he gave more of the vaccine and more frequent
doses. His method is, of course, reasonable when one is dealing with groups
of picked men, but it would be difficult to apply generally to a civilian popula-
tion where patients suffering from chronic respiratory affections, Bright’s
disease, and the like would be liable to severe reactions after inoculation
unless considerable discrimination were exercised. In civilian populations
it seems safer to use a smaller dose first unless the inoculating physician is
reasonably certain that the individual is in good health, in which case the
first dose might, with advantage, be considerably larger.


The Value of Vaccination in respect of Case Mortality.
The results of an analysis of 3,831 cases of the disease treated in Melbourne
hospitals is given in the statistical analysis of the material by Mr. Cherry.
In that paper he shows that the severity of the disease is much less in the
inoculated than in the uninoculated, and that the case mortality is only
one-third. These figures are so large as to warrant reliance being placed on
them.
There is, however, another factor that is correlated with the improved
mortality rate, and that is the earlier hospitalization of the inoculated. Mr.
Cherry deals with this fully in his mathematical analysis, and shows that,
while the early hospitalized cases recover in greater numbers than those
arriving in hospital late, still, after making full allowance for this factor, there
is a markedly lower death-rate amongst the inoculated as against the
uninoculated.
If the incidence be reduced by inoculation, as shown in the railway figures,
in the proportion of eight to five, and if, further, the case mortality in the
inoculated be only one-third of that in the uninoculated, it seems reasonable
to conclude that for five inoculated persons who die there will be 24 of the
uninoculated approximately, the respective populations at risk being of
equal size.
We have not used the railway figures for comparison of percentage
mortalities, as the numbers were so small as to be entirely unreliable. The
total deaths in the railway employees were twelve, six amongst the uninocu-
lated, two amongst the doubly inoculated, and four in the once inoculated.
On H.M.A.S. Encounter (see page 45), which has locally been rather
freely quoted as an instance in which projffiylactic inoculation failed to prevent
an outbreak, it is important to notice that, although this was an extensive
ship-outbreak involving 92 cases, it was the most extensive outbreak without
a single death on any vessel amongst the whole 171 vessels dealt with.
H.M.A.S. Fantome also had 78 cases without a single serious case, the whole
ship’s personnel having recently been twice inoculated. It is reasonable to
correlate these facts with the fact that the personnel of these vessels were the
most completely inoculated ship’s companies in the whole series.
The Value of Inoculation in Treatment.
At some of the Quarantine Stations inoculation was used as a method of
treatment. It is for various reasons impossible to express statistically the
results obtained, but it may be recorded that in the opinion of the medical
officers using this form of treatment the good effect on the clinical course of
the cases so treated was unmistakable.
The Negative Phase.
We have seen (railway figures) that after one inoculation there was no
definite increase in the attack rate. Mr. Cherry has found that after the
second inoculation there is probably a tendency for more cases to occur
during the first five days than during subsequent days, but since there is a
marked diminution in the incidence of the disease, and in the case mortality
after second inoculation, this must be interpreted as a lag in the onset of
immunity rather than as an evidence of a negative phase.


Effect of Early Hospitalization.
Early hospitalization is associated with a high recovery rate, but there
is no definite evidence that the high recovery rate is due to this factor. It
is obvious that a mild case cannot enter hospital on the tenth day of the
disease, as it has already recovered some days before. The late hospitaliza-
tion is probably a means of selecting out the severe type of case ; the high
mortality of the late hospitalized would not in that case be evidence of
defective early treatment but simply of greater severity of the disease.
Hospital treatment is probably chiefly of value as a means of reducing the
number of foci of infection.
Conclusions.
(1) The use of the vaccine was associated with a fall in the incidence and
case mortality of the disease, the ratio of deaths in the inoculated and uninoc-
ulated groups being as 5 to 24.
(2) Some small part of this improvement was apparently associated with
earlier hospitalization of the inoculated.
(3) Inoculation should be more widespread. The doses used were rela-
tively small and might with advantage be increased. Repetition of the
process would almost certainly augment the immunity.
(4) Sufficient hospital accommodation should be provided to permit of
the early admission of all cases.

THE VALUE OF INOCULATION-A STATISTICAL INQUIRY.
By T. M. Cherry, B.A.
PART I.—CASES TREATED AT THE VARIOUS ISOLATION HOSPITALS IN
MELBOURNE.
The available data are from 3,831 cases, for which returns have been
made. These cases all occurred in Victoria, the majority between the
beginning of the Victorian epidemic (about 28th January, 1919) and the
middle of March, but a few occurred earlier in January and in December.
The subject is treated under three heads—
1. Influence of inoculation upon the death-rate and upon the percentage
of cases of A, B, and C types.
2. Influence of date of hospitalization upon the death-rate and upon
the percentages of A, B, and C types.
3. The “ negative phase ” in connexion with inoculation.
The word “ type ” is used throughout to denote the species of the disease
in regard to severity. As far as precise definition is possible, A type denotes
mild influenza with no complications ; B type denotes mild influenza with
mild pulmonary complications, this term including bronchitis, laryngitis,
tracheitis, pharyngitis, alveolitis, &c. ; C type denotes toxic or fulminating
influenza with severe pulmonary complications, such as pneumonia, broncho-
pneumonia, pleurisy.
The word “ class ” is used to denote the main divisions of the cases.
Thus we have the uninoculated class, the indefinite class {i.e., no information
given re inoculation), and the inoculated class, the latter being subdivided
according as the inoculation was once, twice, or indefinite.
The data are contained on cards, of which there should be one for each
patient; some, however, represent a group of cases, these being referred to
in Table No. 1 as “ grouped cards.” These cards are mostly from metro-
politan hospitals, having been filled in by the resident medical officers, but
a few refer to cases in the country, these having been filled in at the office
in Melbourne. Such a card has spaces for (1) name and number of the patient,
(2) inoculation dates, (3) date of onset of disease, (4) date of admission to
hospital, (5) type, (6) complications, (7) result, (8) post-mortem appearances.
These different items are of varying degrees of reliability, and the figures
deduced from them vary accordingly in significance. Considering each item
in turn we have —
(1) Name and Number— Has no bearing on the present inquiry.


(2) Inoculation Bates. These are probably reliable as far as they are
given, but in many cases the date is given indefinitely—“ early
in January” for example —while in other cases there is no
information as to whether inoculation was performed or not.
(3) and (4) Dates of Onset and Admission.-— The latter is quite reliable ;
the former is subject to errors owing to uncertainty on the
part of the patient as to the exact date of onset. The frequency-
curve for period between onset and admission shows a marked
maximum at seven days, due to patients stating the date of
onset in round numbers at a week before admission. Satis-
factory allowance can be made for this.
(5) Type. —Here there is a good deal of uncertainty. Each separate
hospital resident probably has his own ideas as to what actually
constitutes a case of A, B, or C type, and in many cases this
space has been filled in with some such word as “ acute,”
“ serious.” We can take the total figures as referring to the
averages of what are regarded as A, B, and C types dt the dif-
ferent hospitals ; and the percentages of types for the various
classes are comparable just in so far as the cases on which they
are based have been drawn representatively from all the hospitals.
Any marked irregularity in the figures can be explained by this
indefiniteness in the type-definitions combined with a pre-
ponderance of cases from one particular hospital. Thus the
percentage of B-type cases in the once inoculated class is 42 per
cent., which is abnormally high (twice as great as in any other
class). This is due to the presence of a single card representing
98 cases of B type from the St. Vincent de. Paul Orphanage,
while from all the other hospitals together there are only 36
once-inoculated cases of this type.
(6) Complications. —Here the data are even less reliable than in regard
to “type.” In many cases, owing to rush of work, when the
cards were filled in this space has been left blank, There
is no unanimity of opinion as to what constitutes a compli-
cation. For example, about 150 cases of type C have
“ pneumonia ” marked as a complication. Probably twice as
many cases actually developed this pathological condition, but
only half the doctors considered it as a complication, the
other half thinking it a regular manifestation of “pneumonic ”
influenza.
(7) Result. —This must be either “ death ” or “ recovery.” There
can be no difference of opinion on a matter of this sort, and the
only uncertainty is in the case of a few patients for whom cards
were sent in before they had left hospital.
(8) Post-mortem. —TKe result of this would give further information
as to complications, but in the majority of cases no post-mortem
examination was performed, or, at any rate, no result was
entered on the cards.

NOTES ON ABOVE TABLES—
1. In the light of the remarks on page 90 above as to the reliability of
the data, it is evident that more significance can be given to the
percentage of deaths on the total number of cases in a class than to the
other percentages in Table 2. Consider classes 3,4, and 5 of that
table, these being divisions of a general inoculated class. For these the
death rates are so close that they can be regarded as equal within the limits
of error, and the percentages of C-type cases also agree approximately. [The
discrepancy in the percentage of B-type cases in class 4 had already been
explained as due to a large number coming from one hospital, and the
abnormally high percentage of type B of course affects those for types A and C
in the opposite direction.] We are justified then in grouping these three
classes together, forming a total inoculated class, number 6 in Table 2.
2. Treatment of the Indefinite Class. —This class, No. 2 in Table 2, is
remarkable for the high percentages of deaths in the total number of cases
and in the number of C-type cases. The explanation of this lies in the
nature of that class. Many patients would be so ill when brought to
hospital that no history could be taken, and they would of necessity belong
to the indefinite class. We may say that the high percentage of deaths ex-
plains the indefiniteness of the class rather than that the indefiniteness explains
the high percentage. This class then must be regarded as containing many
of the more serious cases from the inoculated and uninoculated classes, and
allowance must be made for these cases in calculating the death rates, &c.,


in these classes. The indefinite cases are therefore divided proportionately
between the uninoculated and inoculated classes. [Since the percentages of
deaths and of C-type cases are smaller for inoculated than for uninoculated,
the probability is that there is a smaller proportion of inoculated in the
indefinite class than exists between classes 6 and 1 in Table 2. Hence we
certainly do not favour the case for inoculation by allotting the indefinite
class in this manner.] We have—
-290 cases of A type allotted in ratio 937 : 658, i.e., 170 : 120.
176 „ B „ „ 389 : 310, i.e., 98 : 78.
215 „ C „ „ 676 : 180, i.e., 170 : 45.
139 deaths „ „ 218 : 36, i.e., 119 : 20.
Adding these numbers to the appropriate numbers in classes 1 and 6 we
get the results set forth as classes 7 and 8 in Table 2, giving the most probable
percentages of deaths and of A, B, and C types which we can deduce from
the available data.
3. Accuracy of the Results. —The problem here is—Given a sample, say, of
n cases, containing some fraction of the total infected population ; from
this are calculated percentages of deaths, and of A, B, and C types for
inoculated and uninoculated classes, find the error in assuming that these
proportions hold in the infected population at large. Errors can arise through
(1) variation in the actual sample chosen, i.e., the group of actual cases for
whom cards might be filled in; (2) mistakes in the counting of cases, taking of
histories, and filling in of cards. Errors from this latter source are certainly
present, due to carelessness on the part of those filling in the cards, together
with a certain amount of “ faking ” of histories, but in the absence of
quantitative evidence no correction can be made. Errors from the former
source are known as “ errors of sampling,” and are best measured by the
“ standard error,” a, which is such that nearly all the variations (over 99 per
cent.) in the measurement of a given quantity which would occur through
sampling lie within a range of -p 3ct on either side of the mean value. Errors
of sampling are also measured by the “ probable error,” which gives the
limits within which the result is a likely as not to lie. The probable error is
usually about two-thirds of the standard error.
Suppose that out of the total number (m) of cases samples containing
n cases are chosen successively at random. Let p and qbe the probabilities
respectively for and against any event in a particular case (say, “ death ” or
“ occurrence of C type ”). The numbers of cases in the different samples
containing this event will fluctuate round a mean value, the dispersion of the
distribution being measured by the standard error or, where —
m n
a 2 = npq
m 1
This formula holds only if p and q remain constant for each sample and for
each case in each sample, and also only if we may regard the different oases


in each sample as being uncorrelated, i.e., not causally connected. Neither of
these conditions is even approximately fulfilled in the present case, for p, the
probability of “ death ” or “ occurrence of C type,” will vary greatly from
case to case, while the occurrence of several cases in one family or institution
will usually be due to infection spread from one member, i.e., the occurrence
of the cases is connected with this one member and the cases are correlated.
Hence the results deduced from this formula must be regarded as giving-
only some idea of the relative magnitude of the standard errors of the different
quantities. The actual magnitude cannot be determined because the
correlation between the different cases is very complex in nature and quite
indeterminate in magnitude.
In the present case also we have only one sample, and we must take the
values of p and q from the actual sample since no theoretical values are
available. This introduces another uncertainty into the value of the
standard error, but the effect is small provided n, the number of cases in the
sample, is large. In the present case this condition is fulfilled.
The nearest we can get to m, which should be the total number of infected
cases, is to take the total number of notified cases, which for the period under
consideration is about 7,700. The number of cases in our sample, nis 3,831.
The factor m n is then about and v =’7 approx. As a matter
m—l 1
of fact it is not important to get the value of m exactly, because (1) a large
variation in m makes but little difference to the value of the factor A I
1
(Thus even if m = 00, V / W ~ n = 1, which is less than half as great again
\m 1
as 0-7]; and (2), as pointed out above, it is only on the relative magnitude
of the standard errors that we can depend.
The standard errors given in italics in Table 2 and in other tables
throughout this chapter are worked out by this formula. Thus taking the
first number 937, the frequency of Type A for the uninoculated class, we
have-
-937 _ 3831 - 937 _ 2894
P ' 3831’ q 3831 3831
mniq o o i
=|, n = 3831
m 1
l ~ bTWT, I "937 2894 _ i
Henc = , = \! 3831 • *
= 18-8 approximately ; and the corresponding percentage error is—
iß--8 X 100 = 0-94
2002


The interpretation of this result is that 46 * 8 per cent, is the most probable
percentage of A-type cases in the uninoculated class, and over 99 per cent,
of the variations from this result due to the fluctuations of simple sampling
would probably lie within the range (46’8 ± 3 x 0*94) per cent., i.e.,
between the values 44 per cent, and 49-6 per cent. Similarly we interpret
the other results.
4. Conclusions— The figures in Table 2 speak for themselves. Looking
at classes 7 and 8, which contain the most probable figures for uninoculated
and inoculated classes respectively, it is seen that the death rate in the former
is over three times that in the latter. Moreover, the percentage of serious
cases (C type) amongst the uninoculated is twice what it is amongst the
inoculated, and of these serious cases fewer die amongst the inoculated
(the percentages of deaths amongst the C type being 40 per cent, and 25
per cent, respectively). - '
As regards complications, no definite conclusions can be drawn. Owing
to so many different observers working independently bn no fixed statistical
plan the data are too indefinite. So far as any result at all can be deduced,
the figures indicate that the proportion of those having any particular
complication, say, gastric, is little influenced by inoculation. This result is
to be expected upon theoretical grounds. Inoculation would not affect a
person’s inherent liability to attack in some particular organ, and once he
has caught the disease we should always expect a complication in that par-
ticular organ. Our data give just the number of those who have caught the
disease ; hence we expect the same proportion of complications amongst
inoculated and uninoculated cases, that proportion being the same as the
proportion of those in the community having liability to attack in particular
organs.
It appears from the figures in Table 2 that there is no essential difference
between the onee and twice inoculated classes. This suggests, so far as the
present material is concerned, that one inoculation may have as great a
protective effect as two.
5. Appended is a chart (Figure A) showing graphically the percentages of
A. B, and C types and of deaths in the uninoculated and inoculated classes.
6. It should be noticed that nothing has been said about relative liability
to infection of inoculated and uninoculated. To find this we require to know
the relative numbers in the two classes who are exposed to infection, and no
figures are available on this point.
7. Since it is well known among medical men
is an important factor in reducing the likelihood of death, we must examine
whether the lesser case mortality amongst the inoculated may not be due


to an earlier average date of hospitalization. This investigation is carried
out in the following pages.

class are grouped together. The figures would be too small if this were not
done. [Where it is convenient “ D type ”is used below to denote death.]
The figure in the first column is the difference between the dates of onset
and admission as entered on the card for any particular case. It obviously
does not specify the time exactly. Thus “ 0 days ” might mean any period
from 0 to almost 24 hours ; “1 day ” might mean any period from about
12 to 48 hours, and so on. All these periods after the first will be equal,
but the first, “Odays,” probably specifies a period only about -| the
length of the others. We might multiply the figures in the first row by
3
- to correct for this, but as it would make no difference to the percentages
z
on which we chiefly work it has not been done. It is to be noticed that the
figure for “ 7 days ”is in every case larger than those surrounding it. This
is due to patients stating the date of onset in round numbers at a week before
admission. This has been allowed for by taking as the frequency for 7 days
the mean of those for 6,7, and 8 days, and distributing the excess between the
figures for 6 days and 8 days, giving slightly more to the latter. [Other systems
were tried, but this was best judged by the tests of good results and simplicity.]

Thus, for the first column _ --- =l2 approx., and 20 12 = 8. We

allot 3 to the 6-day frequency, 4 to the 8-day, and 1 to the 9-day frequency,
which does not appear in the table. These “ smoothed ” results are given in
black figures beside the corresponding unsmoothed figures.
These results have been plotted in Figure 1, which shows frequency
curves for uninoculatod in ordinary and for inoculated in black figures. It
is seen that for all the curves to the right of the “ 4 days ” vertical, and for
the D-curve uninoculated, and the C and D curves inoculated throughout,
there is a considerable divergence of the actual figures from those that would
give a smooth curve. In the figure the most probable curves have been
drawn. By reference to Table 4 below, it is seen that the departure of the
points from these smooth curves is in every case less than three times the
standard errors of curves, i.e., the points are within the limits of the fluctua-
tions of simple sampling.

Now the information desired is not how many cases of any particular
type are admitted to hospital at any specified time after onset of the disease,
but what proportion of those admitted at a specified time after onset will
result in serious cases or death. To show this percentages of A, B, C, D
types are worked out for those admitted each day, and the results exhibited
in a table. Because of the smallness of many of the figures with consequent
large fluctuations of sampling, it waS thought better to calculate the per-
centages from the smoothed curves in Figure 1. Accordingly, in Table No. 4
are given the smoothed frequencies taken from these curves, and in Table
No. 5 these are converted into percentages on the total number of cases
in each day-group.
The results in Table No. 5 are exhibited in Figure 2. The numbers in
italics are the standard errors in the frequencies beside which they
stand ; these were not calculated for points which showed no departure
from the smoothed curves.


Fig. 2.—Percentages of A, B, C, D types for different Dates of
Hospitalization.
C. 8662.


Notes on the above Tables and Figures.
1. It appears from Table 5 and Figure 2 that greater percentages of C
and D type cases are admitted on the day of onset than on the following
day. This result might be a false one, due to fluctuations of sampling or to
the indefiniteness of the exact periods specified by the terms “ 0 days,”
&c., in the tables ; but it admits of a ready theoretical explanation. A
certain number of patients are attacked suddenly, perhaps in the street,
and are taken straight to hospital. Such a patient might have been walking
about for days with a mild form of influenza, and then suddenly be attacked,
say, with a cardial or cerebral complication. For such a case the onset
would be put down as the same day as admission, whereas influenza of A
type might have been present for some days previously. These suddenly
attacked cases, which can occur only in the “ 0 days ” group, account for the
greater proportion of C type cases and of deaths in that group than in the
following one.
2. it is very noticeable in Figure 1 that the maxima for the curves of A
and B type occur more than a day earlier for the inoculated class than for the
uninoculated. The same is true for the total number of cases ; see the
“ total ” columns in Table 4. This may mean that a person who has the
forethought to get inoculated will probably also be wise enough to go to
hospital as soon as possible after onset of the disease,
3. The general trend of the curves in Figure 2 is striking. Those for
A-type cases steadily fall, and those for C-type cases and for cases resulting
in death steadily rise. The curves for B-type cases show a slight upward
trend, but this is unimportant, as the B-type is just an intermediate between
A and C types, and it probably suffers more from variation in definition than
do A and C types.
4. The correspondence between the shapes of the curves for inoculated
and uninoculated classes is close, indicating that the same general results
follow by delaying hospitalization. It is noticeable, however, that the
curve for the inoculated class approaches the corresponding curve of the
uninoculated class more and more closely as we move to the right of the
figure. Thus, taking the “ death-curves ” the ratios of corresponding
ordinates are—
For 0 days .. .. .. .. 30 : 1
„ 1 day .. .. .. .. 6:1
~ 4 days .. .. .. .. 1*3:1;
and similarly for the C-type curves. This indicates that the beneficial effect
of inoculation in allaying the severity of the disease gets less and less the
longer we delay hospitalization. The smallness of the figures on which the
curves are based, however, makes this result of doubtful reliability.
6. It can be seen from Figures 1 and 2 that the smaller death rate for
the inoculated class —4-0 compared with 13*8 —is to a small extent
accounted for by earlier hospitalization. Using the death rates in Table 5
we might by the ordinary methods work out “ standard death rates,” In

the present case this was not done, the reasons being (1) doubt as to the
best system of weights to use, (2) the doubtful reliability of the death rates
for the later dates of hospitalization.
The Negative Phase in Inoculation.
The available data give for each case the last date of inoculation and
the date at which onset occurred. The figures are given in the following
table:—
From these figures, using the proportional daily total, a curve may be
constructed showing the numbers of cases which occurred at different
periods after inoculation. This is shown in Figure 3. This curve,
which would indicate a pronounced negative phase during the first ten days,
cannot be taken as the true curve showing liability to infection at any specified
Fig. 3 .—Crude frequency-curve according to period between inoculation and onset.
period after inoculation. For instance, two months after inoculation prac-
tically no cases occur, and the curve is practically coincident with the base
line. This is obviously not due to the greater protective effect of inoculation
after two months, but to the very few people who had been inoculated for
that length of time. We must then determine whether the falling off of this
curve is due to a real increasing protective effect or only to the smaller number
of cases that are available. The data must be examined afresh. It is

found that the number of cases inoculated between the specified dates are as
follow :
[N.B. —These figures include some cases for which dates of inoculation,
but not of onset, were available.]
To obtain a true estimate of the negative phase we should examine the
figures for a number of cases inoculated at the same time and subjected to
equal risks of infection throughout the whole period under consideration. It
is impracticable to make this period more than 24 days because of lack of data.
We must exclude cases inoculated before 29th January, because the epidemic
did not begin till then, and we must exclude cases inoculated after 14th
February, for such cases would not have had the 24 days’ exposure to infection
till after 10th March. Beyond that date the returns cannot be counted upon
as being complete. Fortunately, the period from 29th January to 14th February
is that in which most inoculation took place, as is seen from (1) the curve of
frequency of inoculation as deduced from the cases under consideration
Fig. 4. —Showing curve of vaccine output (thin, serrated line) and curve of inoculation-frequency
(heavier line).
(Fig. 4) ; (2) the vaccine output curve (Fig. 4), for which the maximum occurs
a few days earlier. Hence the figures, already far too small, are not reduced
beyond the limit of usability.
Even after weeding out the data to this extent, there still remains the
fact that the infectivity of the epidemic as measured by its incidence was not
constant during the period under consideration (29th January—loth March).

This could be allowed for, but in the present case the figures are so small
that it would only be splitting hairs to correct them.
The figures for this restricted period are —
The chief point requiring notice here is the proportional daily total for
“ 0 days.” Supposing inoculation to be carried on at a uniform rate all day,
we see that “ 0 days ” really means the period 0-12 hours ; "1 day ” means
the period 12-36 hours, and so on. Hence, to get the proportional total for
the 0-day group we multiply by 2.
The points corresponding to the proportional daily totals are plotted in
Figure 5, and the most likely smooth curve has been drawn, use being
made of the averages given below—
The wave averages are found because the points lie roughly on three
distinct waves. [To find the average for a wave, average the ordinates of
the points belonging to it, but when a point belongs to two waves count it
as belonging only half to each. Thus —-
12 +ls+ll+ 7 + 1J 2Q-3 • H “1“ 4r 9 + H_o.g j
4| i + 3 + If
The smoothed totals in Table 8 are taken from the curve in Figure 5,
and the standard errors in that table are calculated from the smoothed
totals.


The curve in Figure 5 shows a negative phase lasting four or five days
after inoculation. This curve is based on figures which are too small, and
the errors of sampling have been large, as is seen by the amount of
smoothing necessary. We must regard it as an indication rather than a
proof of the true state of affairs regarding the negative phase.
Fig. 5.—Showing actual (dotted) and smoothed frequency-curves according
to the period between inoculation and onset.
It is to be observed that we have not shown whether the phase in the
first few days is actually “ negative,” i.e., whether a person would be more
liable to infection than if he had not been inoculated. For, as pointed out
above (page 97), we have no measure of the relative liability to infection of
inoculated and uninoculated. The curve in Figure 6 gives us the probable
relative liability to infection for different times after inoculation, but we have
no means of getting the liability to infection of uninoculated on the same
scale. The curve is, in fact, as readily explained on the hypothesis of a
delayed onset of immunity as it is on that of a negative phase.
General Conclusions.
1. Inoculation reduces the death rate to one-third of its value for uninocu-
lated, and the percentage of C-type cases to one-half.
2. The longer hospitalization is delayed the greater becomes the proba-
bility of death or of onset of C-type influenza. This is true for inoculated
and uninoculated.
3. The liability to infection after inoculation is constant after five days.
From 0 days to five days it is higher, ascending gradually.
Note. —It might be found on collecting more data that the numerical
results deduced in this inquiry were materially altered. This would be due
to a change in the incidence of the epidemic and not to inaccuracies in the
present working. Mathematically, using the terminology of page 96, it
would be equivalent to a change in the probability p, such change not being
covered by the standard errors deduced on that and following pages.

They occurred at various periods between the middle of November and the
beginning of April.
The data were contained on cards as for the Melbourne hospital cases, and
included dates of inoculation, onset and admission, type, complications,
result, and findings at any post-mortem, examination. In addition, for all the
New South Wales cases, the ship from which the case came was also given,
making it possible to compare the incidence on the different ships quarantined
in that State. For this reason, as also on account of the greater number of
cases from that State, the data from the New South Wales cases proved most
useful.

In some vessels more cases are shown than actually occurred. This is accounted for ty the fact
that some of the shore staff engaged in attending upon the ship cases are included ami ngst the
latter. In ve-sels where the number cf cases shewn is less than actually recurred the deficiency is
due to incomplete returns.

For comparison with these figures, the following are the corresponding,
figures for hospital cases in Melbourne
The outstanding feature in this table is that the death rate in every group
except those from Western Australia is either abnormally high or abnormally
low ( i.e ., taking the death rate for hospital cases in Melbourne as normal).
We have the groups from s.s. Atua, Makura, St. George, Ooma, Pacifique,
and from Victoria giving abnormally high death rates. Those from s.s.
Medic, Manuka, Encounter, from various ships in New South Wales, and from
South Australia are abnormally low. Now the standard errors in most of
these percentage death rates are of sufficient magnitude to explain the
abnormality as due to fluctuations of sampling, but it is worth while to see
if the abnormality cannot be otherw’se explained ( e.g., taking the. St.
George, 47 A 3 X 17 gives limits within which the normal death rate, 14,
lies).
The separate groups are examined below, and we find that only in the
cases from the Victorian Quarantine Station and from the s.s. Makura do
fluctuations of sampling need to be invoked to explain the abnormality.
It can hardly be just a coincidence that in these groups the death rates are
based on a smaller number of cases than anywhere else.
In the case of the s.s. Atua the crew consisted partly of whites and partly
of coloured people (Fijians). The figures for the two sections are as follows: —

It is seen that the abnormality in the death rate is due to the presence of
the coloured men in the crew. Excluding these the death rate is normal,
while for them it is three or four times as great as for whites.
In the case of the s.s. St. George, the crew were all natives, and the death
rate, 47 per cent., is, considering the small number of cases involved,
remarkably near that for the natives on the Atua.
Taking now the s.s. Ooma , 45 out of a crew of 56 were natives. Hence
the death rate of 12 per cent, is not at all excessive even for an inoculated
crew. This is about three times the death rate for the inoculated class
amongst Europeans (Melbourne), and the ships St. George and Atua gave a
somewhat similar multiple for uninoculated.
In the s.s. Padjique the crew were nearly all natives. Hence the death
rate of 8 per cent, appears to err on the low rather than on the high side.
Turning now to the groups for which the death rates are lower than
normal ( i.e ., lower than for hospital cases in Melbourne), it is seen that the
fluctuations of sampling are sufficient to explain this in most of the groups ;
but for the groups from the s.s. Medic and from various ships in New South
Wales, where the number of cases is greater, the discrepancy cannot be so
explained ( e.g ., for the Medic group, 4 - 7dz3X 1‘ 3 gives limits 0- 8 and 8' 6
within which the normal death rate, 14, does not lie). It will be shown below
that the explanation of the low death rate lies partly in an earlier average date
of hospitalization, but that, even allowing for this, the death rate is lower
than for Melbourne hospital cases.
In order to make these station figures comparable with those from
Melbourne hospital cases, we must first exclude the native cases, as there is
nothing to correspond with these in Melbourne hospitals. We exclude the
whole of the groups from s.ss. Ooma, Padjique, and St. George, and the
native cases from the s.s. Atua. We classify the remainder according to
the period elapsing between onset and admission to hospital. The figures
are so small that no ships can be treated separately except the s.ss. Medic
.and Encounter. The figures are as follows :■ —-

There is more than one reason why these cases should be excluded, and
only the New South Wales cases considered : —(1) These cases all belong to
the “ 0 days ” group ; there are no corresponding figures for the 1,2, 3, &c.,
days groups, and adding them in to the figures in Table No. 2 would destroy
any homogeneity that those figures possess. (2) These cases all belong to the
inoculated class ; there are no balancing figures for uninoculated, and, again,
we should have the homogeneity of Table No. 2 destroyed.
In order to obtain a true comparison of the incidence of the disease and
of death in the Sydney station cases and the Melbourne hospital cases, we
must compare the percentage death rates and type rates for each separate
day of hospitalization, since variation in this factor alters the death and type
rates. The following figures from hospital cases in Melbourne correspond to
the figures in Table No. 3. In the two lower rows the numbers are reduced
proportionally, so as to bring the totals in the neighbourhood of 538 and
220 respectively, -these numbers being derived from groups 4 and 7 of
Table No. 3 (N. 8.—538 = 589 —2B 23, and is equal to the total in
group 4, excluding cases whose date of hospitalization is over 6 or
indefinite).

On the figures in Tables Nos. 3, 4 is based the graph (Figure 6), from
which it is seen that the New South Wales station cases are hospitalized
earlier on the average than are the Melbourne hospital cases. Now, the station
figures are too small to get a fair idea of the variation of the death rate from
day to day of hospitalization. Hence we divide the cases into two groups
only, viz., those admitted 0,1, or 2 days after onset, and those admitted
3,4, 5, or 6 days after. The figures for these groups are contained in the
following table :
From this table it appears that, within the limits of error, the death
rates for the “ 0,1, 2 days’ ” group for both inoculated and uninoculated
classes are the same for Sydney station and for Melbourne hospital cases
(3'5, 3-2; 1• 1, I'2). But the station cases show a smaller death rate
for the “ 3,4, 5, 6 days’ ” group than do the Melbourne hospital cases, and
the standard errors are such that it is exceedingly unlikely that the dis-
crepancy is due to fluctuations of sampling.


CHAPTER VIII.
MASKS AND INHALATION CHAMBERS.
The extreme rapidity and ease with which the infection of influenza-
appeared to spread from the sick to the healthy necessitated early and earnest
attention to the question of prophylactic means for the protection of those
members of the quarantine staff whose duties brought them into close asso-
ciation with cases, and also for the cutting short of spread after vessels had
been brought under quarantine control.
Two obvious measures suggested themselves —masking, and the use of
prophylactic vaccine. A third precaution, the employment of medicated
inhalations, required further consideration, in view of the absence of precise
knowledge concerning the practical value of such applications, or of their
adaptability for use on any considerable scale under the conditions of active
quarantine. A series of experiments was undertaken at the Commonwealth
Serum Laboratories, and it was finally ascertained that the best results in
securing the dispersal of metallic salts into a respirable atmosphere, were
obtained from Hine’s atomizing jets, described in the report of the Inter-allied
Sanitary Conference of March, 1918. This method had been largely used in
the British Army at the instance of Colonel Leishman in the course of operations,
against cerebro-spinal fever, and this authority had testified that the results
had been good. The disinfectant employed was a 1 per cent, solution of
zinc sulphate.
The development, application, and results of masking and inhalation
will be now dealt with. Vaccines are considered separately in another
chapter.
The objects for which masks appeared to be required were :
(1) Protection of officers and employees whose duties brought them
into contact with infected vessels or infected persons.
(2) Limitation of range of infected sputum from patients, the mask
being worn in this case by the patient.
(3) Mitigation of risks of possible conveyance of infection by officers
boarding uninfected vessels during observational detention,.
and during necessary communication between station staff and
persons from outside.
(4) Psychological advantages from sense of protection experienced by
nervous persons.
The types of masks employed at various station hospitals included the
following :
(1) Full hood descending to or below shoulders, with or without
celluloid eye pieces.
(2) Short hood, with or without celluloid eye pieces, tied under the
chin.
(3) Wire-frame mask, fitting over the nose and mouth and secured by~
tapes or ear loops.


(4) Plain rectangular fold covering nose and mouth and extending
over the cheeks. This was variously combined with goggles,
and with wool plugs designed to filter air passing down alongside
the nose.
Various antiseptics were used to moisten the masks, principally 1 in 20
carbolic.
The material used for masks consisted of gauze in various thicknesses,
or plain lint in two thicknesses with the soft sides in approximation.
The defects noticed in the practical application of masking comprised—
(l) Obstruction to respiration. With thick masks, this was very
noticeable, especially in warm weather, causing discomfort
from insufficient supply of air, and the rebreathing of partly
respired warm air.
(2) Heat and stuffiness. This is the principal drawback to the hood
type in warm weather.
(3) Inaccurate fitting. This may be due either to incorrect type or
adjustment of frame masks, or to careless wearing. Frame
masks may be improved by fitting a small roll of cotton-wool
on the border-wire and moulding the frame accurately to the
facial outline. The use of wool plugs alongside the nose is
necessary, to insure accurate fitting of the rectangular type of
fiat mask. This type should be of proper size, at least 8 inches
by inches for an adult, and should be properly secured to fit
closely around the chin and cheeks.
(4) Careless wearing. This is the principal defect of all patterns of
mask, and there is a decided, and even unconscious, tendency
to slip a frame or flat mask up, in order to obtain freedom of
breathing.
(5) Neglect of cleanliness or antiseptic precaution. These essentials
require constant attention, and there appears to be an obvious
risk in the replacement of a used mask with the exposed side
inwards.
From observation of the extreme difficulty encountered in securing the
proper and careful use of masks amongst quarantine staffs, who might be
expected to recognise the risks constantly before them, and who worked
under close discipline, there would appear to be little value in any compulsory
scheme of public masking, so far as actual protection from infection is
concerned.
The value of masks in practice would appear to be limited to protection
against gross infection at short range, under conditions involving short
duration to exposure, and to be determined by the make, fitting, and use of the
apparatus. The observations of Teague and Strong in connexion with mask
protection against pneumonic plague go to show that, for absolute protection
from droplet infection by the bacillus prodigiosus for even short periods,
an elaborate hood of several thicknesses of Canton flannel is required. This
is incompatible' with the requirements of ordinary ward or station work in
warm weather. Short of absolute protection, however, a properly fitting


flat mask of two thicknesses of lint, or six or more thicknesses of close woven
gauze, with nose plugs of wool, appeared to afford very substantial protection,
if the defects involved above were avoided.
The greatest class-risk is certairly borne by nurses on ward duty, and from
study of the infections amongst nurses in the various Stations, there appears
to be a definite inverse ratio between the number of infections and the relative
strictness and precision with which the use of masks was inforced. Of 37
nurses employed in the civil section of the Quarantine Hospital at Sydney,
where various types of masks were constantly worn on ward duty, twelve con-
tracted influenza. Amongst 44 military nurses employed in the Military
section of the Quarantine Hospital at Sydney during quarantines of transports,
amongst whom proper care or attention in the use of masks was not so strictly
observed, 22 developed the disease. In Adelaide Quarantine Station, where
an elaborate ritual of masking was inforced for nurses, none contracted in-
fluenza in the course of four months, whilst over 180 cases were being treated.
The use of masks on patients, when circumstances require and permit it,
is an obvious ajid useful additional protection to those in attendance. Risks
to nurses when sponging or otherwise handling coughing patients, to medical
officers when auscultating chests, and to stretcher-bearers transferring patients
with cough and profuse sputum, may be mitigated very considerably if the
condition of the patients permits the use of a mask or towel as a screen against
droplets and masses of sputum.
An instance was recorded, from which it appeared probable that a nurse,
in the early invasive stage of influenza, infected a number of other nurses and
officers during a meal, when masks were necessarily not worn.
At one Station was recorded an instance in which a whole ward staff was
infected at one time from a delirious patient, who coughed and expectorated
bloodstained sputum, whilst being restrained, at a time when the technique
of masking was not fully understood.
The use of masks by Station officers, who boarded uninfected ships during
observational detention, was inforced from an early date, in order to avoid
any possible risk of conveying infection on board. Similar precautions
were also undertaken in all direct communications between Station staff and
persons coming from outside with supplies. The actual risks are probably
small under the particular conditions, but during the period when virulent
infection was being constantly brought to Stations from New Zealand and
elsewhere, this precaution was closely inforced. Mask depots were established
on the Station jetties, detailed orders issued, and special officers stationed to
insure that no unmasked person was permitted to come alongside or to be
on the jetty at any time.
The psychological advantages of masks are not capable of accurate deduction
or description, but it is considered from experience that masks are of some
practical value in reassuring nervous persons, and in affording a tangible
and obvious indication that precautions are being taken.
The use of steam inhalation as a routine procedure received attention
after consideration of th' reports of the Central Cerebro-spinal Fever Labora-
tory of the British Army authorities. The report of Brigadier-General


Hemming on the “ Use of Hine’s Steam Jet for Disinfection of the Naso-
pharynx by Aerial Spraying ” was adopted as a basis for technical experiments
carried out at the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. The following
extracts from the report will indicate the mechanical details of the apparatus
adopted :
. . . Spray huts of this form are already in use in France, and are being intro-
duced in England.
The delivery of Hine’s steam jet is adjustable from 30 to 130 c.c. per minute. With
a delivery of 100 c.c. of disinfectant per minute per jet from two jets, it is found that a
space of about 13 to 14 square metres (or, say, 150 square feet) of floor surface with a
height of 2• 50 m. to 3• 50 m. can be filled with disinfectant fog in three or four minutes.
This area is suitable for the treatment of about twenty men at one time, and has been taken
as a convenient unit.
Operation. —Each operation of disinfection takes about ten minutes, and, allowing
five minutes for men entering and leaving, four treatments can take place in an hour.
In an installation, therefore, in a hut 18 m. by 4■ 50 m., i.e., a hut of six units, about
120 men can be treated in each operation, or, say, approximately 500 men every hour.
Fitting of Hut.— The pipe supplying the jets with steam is fixed along the long walls
of the hut on either side, at a height of 1•50 m. from the floor. The two jets for each
unit space, which are usually inclined upwards at an angle of 25° more or less, are fixed
on the steam pipe on opposite sides of the section, and so spaced as not to be exactly
facing one another.
Below each jet is fitted a shelf for the vessel containing the disinfectant solution.
The solution used is usually a 1 to 1-5 per cent, solution of zinc sulphate, or for special
cases a 2 per cent, solution of chloramine-T.
With this arrangement of pipes and jets it is obvious that the doors of the hut should
be at the ends of the hut, and these should preferably be made to open outwards in two
leaves. The steam should be available at a pressure of 3•25t0 4• 25 kilog. to the square
centimetre (45 to 60 lbs. to the square inch), preferably about 4 kilog. to the square
centimetre. This will allow of the evaporation of 2 litres of water per jet per hour, with
a margin for heating the radiators.
Detail of Apparatus— The steam pipe should not be of less diameter than 25 mm.,
depending on the distance of the furthest jet from the boiler. The pipes must be pro-
tected against corrosion by a lagging of silico-cotton or other material, and should be
laid with a slight fall to draw-off cocks, to enable hot condensed water to be drawn off,
so that it is not ejected through the jets. A main cock should be provided where the
steam pipe enters the building.
The attachment of the jets to the steam pipe is made by T-pieces, with reducing
sockets ; the angle of the jet can thus be easily modified to suit the form of the ceiling.
The steam from the jet should not impinge on any surface at a distance of less than 3 m.,
since in this case a large quantity of fluid will be thrown down in a heavy shower, and the
spray will not be properly in the air of the room. This constitutes the objection
to the use of very small htfts as spraying chambers.
The delivery of the jets should be carefully adjusted by screwing the fluid suction
jet up and down until the required amount of solution is discharged per minute ; this
test may be effected by trial with plain water. When all the steam jets have thus been
adjusted the chamber is ready for use. Between successive operations the cocks of the
jets, which must be kept lubricated, may be left open, the steam being turned on and off
at the main cock on the steam pipe.
The steam should be turned on before the chamber is occupied in order to warm the
pipes, and any condensed water should be drawn off at the draw-off cocks.
The doors and windows must be made to fit closely so as to exclude draughts, and the
walls, if of ordinary wood construction, will require lining with some impervious material
such as asbestos sheeting.
Two types of inhalation outfit were evolved :
(1) Fixed type for station use, from station steam.
(2) Portable type, suitable for rapid erection on troopships, and for
connexion with ship’s steam.
The fixed type consisted of a wooden building of frame structure, with
flat roof, measuring 20 feet long by 10 feet wide, with an average height of
9 feet. Malthoid was used for the roof in a proportion of these huts, and in
a few cases for the walls. Steam was led in from the Station generators by


lagged pipes, a reducing valve being fitted to secure a pressure of ,50-55 lbs.
to the square inch. A drain-cock was fitted at the lowest point of the re-
ticulation to insure against priming from condensation, and a steam gauge
on the shed side of the reducing valve indicated when the correct pressure
was available.
It was found by experience to be desirable to fit the steam jets and piping
outside the walls in order to prevent unauthorized manipulation of the jets
by those undergoing the process. With this arrangement the medicated
steam was blown through a small orifice in the wall; the jets and the con-
tainers for disinfectant solution were outside the hut, and were thus capable
of completely accurate control by the attendant in charge. The inhalant
used was, at first, a 1 per cent, solution of zinc, sulphate, but at a later stage
it was deemed advisable to raise the proportion to one and a-half and in
some cases, 2 per cent. The period of exposure was ten minutes.
The portable type of chamber for ship use was constructed in bolted
frame sections to provide a building 20 feet by 10 feet, with an average
height of 9 feet. The framework was covered with tarpaulins, and the
steam supply connected with ship’s steam (usually from the supply pipe
to a steam winch) with the intervention of a reducing valve o insure the
correct pressure. The complete outfit of steam fittings for a ship-pattern
inhalation chamber comprised the following items :
6 spray jets.
6f" x tees.
5 f" tees.
4 f" plugs.
18 f" sockets.
1 I" x r tee.
1 pressure gauge, with syphon and cock.
1 lock-up safety valve.
1 Y “ Midget ” steam trap.
1 steam valve.
13" x hexagon nipple.
116' lengths f" steam-pipe (five spare lengths).
2 5' lengths f " steam-pipe.
23' lengths steam-pipe.
6 2' lengths f" steam-pipe (four spare lengths).
2 9" lengths f" steam-pipe.
6 pieces pipe, bent to sketch.
1 piece Y pip e > long.
1 20' rubber hose, with unions.
1 tin graphite compound.
3 f" elbows (spares).
These inhalation chambers could be erected speedily, and their use was
adopted for some time as a systematic procedure in connexion with transports
arriving at Western Australian ports with a history of influenza during the
voyage. The routine was as follows
Sixteen complete sets of steam gear were made available, together with
sixteen hut-frames. These were in charge of a skilled mechanical assistant
of the Quarantine Service staff, who carried out their erection on the ship.


with any necessary assistance fromithe Jtigirte department. A detailed set
of instructions was issued by the quarantine officer to the Senior Medical
Officer of the transport, and a steam trial was conducted under quarantine
supervision in order to demonstrate the practical use of the apparatus. A
daily inhalation parade of all persons on hoard was continued after leaving
for eastern Australian during the subsequent coastal voyage. On
arrival at the terminal port the apparatus was dismantled and packed for
return to Western Australia for use on another transport as required.
A number of vessels were found to be fitted with compartments and gear
described as inhalation chambers, but in no case did these conform to the
requirements of the Hine’s jet systenr as above described.
Prior to the development of the portable type of chamber, a number of
vessels undergoing quarantine in Sydney were fitted with temporary inhalation
gear, operated either from, ship’s steam, or by a flexible connexion from a
quarantine launch lying alongside for the purpose. In all such cases, the
requisite pressure was insured by the use of reducing valves and pressure
gauges. 1 . M
Judged from the extensive experience gained during the operations of the
past six months, the conclusions, with respect to inhalation with zinc sulphate
solution, are somewhat disappointing. It appears to have a definite effect
in preventing and clearing up nasal catarrhs, and there is some evidence to
show that it cuts short a proportion of commencing attacks of influenza.
It produces an undoubted stimulation of the ciliary and secretory activities
of the bronchial mucous membranes, and stimulates the expectorant centres.
On the other hand, the necessary proximity of a number of persons in a close
chamber, and the difficulty of preventing chills, when passing to the cool
outside air, after exposure to warm moist steam, affect its efficiency as a
prophylactic measure in the presence of a disease showing pronounced
tendencies to involve the respiratory tract.
Consideration of results reported from the several divisions points to the
conclusion that, whilst inhalation may be regarded as an auxiliary measure of
some value when applied under quarantine conditions, which permit of the
elimination of these drawbacks, some more satisfactory medicament than
zinc sulphate is required for charging the steam. Chloramine-T was discarded
at a preliminary stage on account of its irritant effect, and inquiries are in
hand with a view to obtaining further direct experimental observation with
reference to the technique of naso-pharyngeal medication by large scale
inhalation methods.

Atua (2) (No. 1).
Steamer tonnage, 1895. Trading between Suva and Sydney, via Momi Bay.
Left Suva 6th December, 1918, with 74 crew (officers, 8 ; engineers, 6 ; deck, 12 ;
engine department, 20 ; providoring, 28). Passengers, 48 (Ist class).
Called at Momi Bay, 7th December, 1918 ; Sydney, 13th December, 1918.
Source of infection, Fiji.
On 7th December, one day out from Fiji, a passenger, G.H., reported sick, with a
temperature of 101, and was diagnosed as feverish cold by the ship’s surgeon. The
symptoms were cough, severe gastric pain, and vomiting, with bronchitic signs in the
chest. The doctor confessed that had he seen this case on shore at Fiji he might have
considered it a mild case of influenza.
Two other cases were noted from the diary kept by the ship’s doctor as suspicious on
10th December. Miss M. reported sick, and diagnosed as feverish cold and bronchial
catarrh. Also Mrs. McK., diarrhoea and dysentery, temperature 102. These cases
apparently cleared up quickly.
15th December, two days after coming into quarantine, the 4th engineer was found
at the daily temperature parade to have a temperature. He was immediately isolated
in the ship’s hospital for observation. On 16th December the patient s condition
suggested influenza. On 17th December the disease had definitely developed, and was
unhesitatinglv pronounced as influenza. He was removed from the ship and placed m
the quarantine hospital on shore, where he was admitted with a temperature ot 10_,
tongue flabby, white with moist fur, eyes watery and bright, slight coryza, appearance
cyanosed, harsh breath sounds at the left base and frontal headache. The history given
by the patient was as follows : —On 14th December he was cleaning the bilge tank and got
wet up to the waist. He worked for some time in the engine room, and then had a bath.
He felt he had caught a chill, and at 2 o’clock next morning he had a rigor and vomited.
He then developed a cough, headache, and coryza. This man had occupied a cabin in
close proximity to the patient who first reported sick. No further case developed, and the
ship, together with the passengers and crew, was released on 24th December, seven days
after the removal of the case from the ship.
This ship’s history was interesting, as showing how mild missed cases may convey the
disease from country to country. Thorough medical inspection and temperature
parade had failed to reveal the presence of influenza until the ship had been under
observation in quarantine for three days.
H.M.A.S. Encounter (No. 2).
This ship left Sydney on 24th November, 1918, at 4 p.m„ with 441 ship’s company
and a relief party of 44. She reached Suva on 30th November at 11 a.m., and landed
2 medical officers, 1 lieutenant, and 6 orderlies. These men were left behind. The ship
was berth 'd alongside the wharf at Suva, naval guards being placed on the wharf at ad
the entrances. The Chief Health Officer came on the wharf and interviewed the ship s
surgeon. No person from the shore was aboard the ship. Coal and water were taken on
board from the wharf by the ship’s company. The vessel left Suva at 6 p.m. the same
day.
On 2nd December all on board were inoculated for the second time with Commonweal h
Coryza Vaccine “ B.” The vessel reached Apia (Samoa) at 9.30 a.m. on 3rd December,
and anchored in the stream. Five medical officers and 24 orderlies were landed. No one
came on board from the shore, the ship’s surgeon superintended taking the stores and
persons ashore in the ship’s boats in order to prevent contact. The vessel left Apia at
3 p.m. the same day, and arrived at Tonga T&bu at 2.30 p.m. on sth December. One
medical officer and five orderlies were landed, no one was permitted to come on the ship.
It is necessary to note here that the ship’s surgeon landed to give information at each port,
but on each occasion he was fully masked. Tonga Tabu was left on 7th December at 10
a.m., and Suva was reached at 6.30 a.m. on 9th December. The vessel went alongside
the wharf and coaled under guard. The Health Officer came on the ship fully masked.
The same day they left the wharf and anchored in the stream. Next morning, 10th
December, the ship was coaled from the Colonial Sugar Refining Coy.’s Fiona, which
came from Auckland. On the previous day Dr. Lynch has discovered a suspicious case
of influenza amongst the crew of the Fiona. During the coaling the whole of the crew
of the Fiona were segregated, and the whole of the coaling done by the ship s company.


The Fiona was alongside for four hours, from 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. The vessel left Suva on
10th December, and dropped anchor at the Quarantine Station, Sydney, at 8.30 a.m.
on 17th December. The ship’s surgeon reported that no influenza had occurred on board.
The only cases of sickness during the voyage reported were :
1 stoker—pneumonia.
1 stoker —boils.
1 leading stoker—amputation of the finger.
1 lieutenant—malaria.
On the morning of the 18th December, one day after the Encounter entered quarantine,
the ship’s surgeon reported a case of tonsilitis and septic throat, which he suspected might
be influenza. He had isolated the patient, W.J., A.B. seaman, in the hospital in a cot
completely surrounded by carbolized sheets. The history given was as follows :—This
man was taken ill on 15th December, two days before reaching Sydney and five days out
from Suva, with headache and lassitude. On examination on the 18th he had a temperature
of 101 • 8, pulse full and rapid (120), eyes bright and suffused, tongue moist and coa.ted,
appeared cyanosed, colour of face bluish, skin hot with sweating at the roots,
granular pharyngitis with one small white patch on the left supra-tonsillar fossa. He
had harsh breathing at the left base and complained of headache, sore throat, pains in the
limbs, and general weakness. Bowels not open since the previous day. Previous history
of sickness—malaria in 1902, but no subsequent attack. Provisional diagnosis was
influenza or malaria. Swabbings were taken from the naso-pharynx and blood for
microscopic examination. Bacteriologist’s report was “No malaria present, throat
swabbings on culture present organisms similar to influenza cases.” The clinical findings
and bacteriologist’s report established the case as one of a severe type of pneumonic
influenza. He was removed from the ship at 3 p.m. on 19 th December, being placed in
one of the ship’s boats and towed to shore by a quarantine launch and placed in the
quarantine hospital. On admission to hospital the records show temperature normal,
slow soft pulse (72), great lassitude and weakness. The degree of weakness and normal
temperature was such as one would expect after an attack of influenza.
The ship was released on 26th December, 1918, after seven days’ observation, no
further case having occurred.

Vessel trading between Suva and Sydney (N.S.W.).
Left Suva 30th January with 81 crew and 143 passengers.
Source of infection, Suva, Fiji.
The vessel arrived at Sydney on 7th February with 81 crew and 143 passengers,
including members of the Samoan Relief Expedition. It was stated that all members
of the crew and passengers had been inoculated on 3rd February.
The ship’s surgeon reported that no sickness had occurred during the voyage. After
medical inspection and thermometer parade the vessel was ordered into quarantine for
seven days’ observation.
On Bth February, one day after entering quarantine, J.C., a fireman, was found to
be ill, and was brought ashore and admitted to hospital. On 10th February another man,
W.D., a steward, was admitted to hospital. No more cases occurred, and the vessel,
with the healthy contacts, was released from quarantine on 16th February. There was
no traceable connexion between these two cases.
Thermometer parades, with zinc sulphate inhalation, had been carried out daily.

History of Voyage. —The ship left Vancouver on 24th September, 1918, and when
three days out, on the 27th September, R., a bell boy, who slept in the after peak, was
taken ill with a “ severe cold,” and went off duty. When seven days out from V ancouver
the ship arrived at Honolulu, and this patient was too ill to turn out for medical inspection.
On 2nd October, the day after leaving Honolulu and five days after R. was taken ill,
two stewards, who slept in the same quarters as R., developed the disease. The ship s
surgeon diagnosed the cases as “ feverish cold.”
Next morning, 3rd October, seven men in the same peak, i.e., the after peak or
“ glory hole,” which contained sixteen berths, went down with the disease. In the
afternoon fourteen me i out of the sixteen in the after peak had developed the disease.
The epidemic then spread to the midship peak and also to the stewards and sailors
forward, and from thence to the firemen further aft on the lower deck.
No passengers developed the disease until 11th October, two days out from Suva.
As fresh cases were developing daily, the captain held a consultation with the ship s
surgeon and two military doctors who were returning from the front, with the result that
the worst cases were isolated in the hospital and in quarters on the bridge deck.
The doctors agreed that the disease was epidemic pneumonic influenza. By the time
the ship reached Buva on 9th October (seven days between ports) 70 members of the crew
were down, and isolation was out of the question. On the run from Suva to Auckland
(three days) the disease increased in a more severe form, 103 cases being down on the
night prior to arrival in Auckland, 12th October. Next morning this number had in-
creased to 110 cases, and during the night the bos’n’s mate died of the disease.
On arrival in Auckland on 12th October the 29 worst cases were removed to the
Auckland General Hospital. The captain endeavoured to make arrangements for the
isolation of all patients not sent to the hospital. This was found to be impracticable,
and the captain eventually boarded up the promenade and shelter decks from the smoking-
room lounge to the after end of the bridge deck. He then removed the patients to the
smoking-room and to interchangeable state rooms on the deck beneath'. He engaged a
doctor from the shore, four nurses, and a dispenser, and placed all patients in isolation in
quarters above-mentioned (first saloon promenade and shelter decks, two floors!.
After a few daya the medical officer engaged from the shore took sick, and another
shore medical practitioner was engaged. With these measures, after nine days, the
epidemic practically ceased.


The ship left Auckland on Monday, 21st October, at 10 p.m. During the stay in
Auckland a stokehold hand died in the General Hospital, and a ship’s steward died on the
In all 155 severe cases and an unknown number of mild cases were treated on the
ship from the first outbreak of the epidemic. The distribution of the recorded cases
among the crew and passengers was as follows ;

On leaving Auckland, ten patients were unfit to rejoin the ship, and were left behind.
These included one passenger and a nurse, who died after the ship left Auckland.
In addition to those treated in hospital, a large number of the crew developed the
disease in a mild form and received medical attention. These men were able to continue
at work, and, unfortunately, no record is available of these mild cases.
In all, five cases proved fatal, all dying of pneumonia, viz. :
T.R., aged 35, reported sick sth October, died 11th November.
H.Y., aged 25, reported sick 13th October, died 21st October.
0.Q., aged 23, reported sick 13th October, died 20th October.
A passenger and a nurse died at Auckland.
The vessel reached Sydney on 25th October, 1918, at 11.30 a.m., with 280 crew and
312 passengers, 103 of whom were taken on at New Zealand.
On arrival four cases were reported on board, one second class passenger and three
crew. The second class passenger had broncho pneumonia, onset 19th October.
Crew-
Fireman —Onset 19th October.
Wiper—Onset 7th October.
Second steward —Onset 25th October.
In the afternoon all the passengers, viz., saloon 153, second class 106, third class 53,
were landed at the Quarantine Station, with sufficient cooks and stewards to look after
them. A medical inspection was held each day. On Sunday, the 27th, a second class
passenger developed the disease.
The ship with some of the crew, who had had the disease and been normal for seven
days, 76 in all, was released on Monday, the 28th, at 8.30 a.m. The contacts landed at
the Quarantine Station were released on Ist November.
Remarks. —The infectious nature of the disease is well shown in that 110 cases occurred
in fifteen days. All these cases, with the exception of ten, occurred amongst the crew.

of whom 16 died, i.e., 2 fatal cases occurring amongst the passengers and 14 amongst the
crew. Fifty-six cases occurred amongst the crew and 32 amongst the passengers.
The source of infection appears to have been Auckland, for the epidemic did not reach
Suva until the s.s. Talune arrived there on 4th November. The first case occurred the
day after the vessel left Auckland. The infection on the Atua was of a very virulent
type. The cases treated at the Quarantine Hospital at North Head, on this trip, were
not exceeded in virulence by any subsequent cases treated there. It was on these cases
that the Commonwealth coryza vaccine was first tried with successful results.

connected with working the ship’s cargo came on board daily from 8 a.m. to 12 noon
and 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. Before coming on the ship these persons were subjected to zinc
sulphate inhalation ashore. The Master and Purser from the ship went ashore on business
on several occasions. Before returning to the ship each time, they were subjected to
zinc sulphate inhalation. None of the crew were permitted to go on shore.
The troops from the Carpentaria were transferred from that vessel to the Riverina

of mail matter. The Officer Commanding Troops and Adjutant went ashore on two
successive days, on official business with the Commandant. The Y.M.C.A. Representative
went ashore on one day on official business. The Senior Medical Officer went ashore to
see the Health Authorities about fitting up an inhalation chamber on board. All these
persons were subjected to zinc sulphate inhalation each time before returning to the
ship.
Four cases of influenza are said to have occurred—date and place unknown. No
particulars are available.
The ship arrived at Sydney on 20th November, 1918, with the above-mentioned crew
and troops. On arrival, she was medically inspected and a temperature parade held.

with high temperature. A Mrs. P. was carried on board at Victoria, and the ship’s surgeon
did not see her until the next day, when it was too late to send her ashore. She died of
senile decay and bronchitis, and was buried at sea. At Honolulu a steward was sent to
the hospital suffering from pneumonia. Some 40 of the stewards and engine department
are reported as having lost a number of days through colds. Five cases of measles
occurred before reaching Suva, four of these had recovered, and the last case, Mrs. J.,
was taken ashore at Suva on 27th November for further treatment. On arrival at
Auckland the ship was ordered into quarantine, six cases are reported to have been sent
on shore with high temperatures on Ist December. On 3rd December a zinc sulphate
inhalation chamber was put up on the ship, and the crew with a number of the
passengers were treated in this daily. The total number of cases landed at Auckland
was 36, in the following order :

The ship arrived at Sydney on 13th December with 155 crew and 251 passengers,
made up of first saloon 128, second saloon 85, third class 30.
The thirteen cases found isolated were immediately landed and placed in hospital,
two of them being dangerously ill. A medical inspection and temperature parade of all
on board was held, 60 persons were found to have a temperature above 98 ‘4, and were
classed as suspects. These persons, together with an anchor watch, were kept on the ship.
All the well people were landed and placed in quarters on shore.
No further cases developed amongst those people who had been classed as well and
placed on shore; but on the 15th three cases, members of the crew, were taken from
amongst the suspects and placed in hospital on shore, and these were the last cases to
occur.
The contacts were released on 20th December, and the suspects, with the ship, on 22nd
December.
Three deaths occurred in hospital, one passenger and two crew.

ship’s surgeon reported no sickness had occurred during the voyage, except one case of
dysentery, ? amoebic.
One case of sub-acute appendicitis and two cases of gastro-enteritis.


History of previous Influenza Infection. —The vessel was lying in Suva, a dean ship,
when the s.s. Talune arrived on 4th November from Auckland with influenza on board.
Several cases landed from the Talune, and carried the disease into Suva where it rapidly
spread. On 11th November the blacksmith’s mate and two boys developed the disease.
When discovered, these men were immediately sent ashore. These men slept m the mess
deck for Tad, and from there the disease spread rapidly through the ship until /8 cases
had occurred amongst 124 crew.
\ll the cases were of a mild character except two, who developed pleurisy. The last
case occurred on the 10th December, and was fit for full duty on 20th December.
The ship was ordered into quarantine for seven days’ observation. Medical inspection
and temperature parades were held daily. To relieve the congestion of the ship all men
having a temperature above normal on arrival were classed as suspects and landed
into an isolation camp on shore. No cases occurred, and the vessel, together with the
crew, was released on the 4th January, 1919.

Source of infection, Wellington, N.Z.
History. —During November and December this ship was trading round the New
Zealand coast. While in Wellington one of the crew, an ordinary seaman, developed
influenza on Bth November, and after one day’s sickness on board was taken ashore to
hospital. f
This man slept in the foe’sle. On 9th November the vessel left Wellington for New
Plymouth, arriving on the 11th. Two firemen developed the disease during the voyage
and were put ashore there. These men did not sleep in the same quarters as the first
man.


On 14th November two more men from the foc’sle sickened with the disease in a mild
form, and were only off duty for a day. On 15th November the chief and second officers
were taken sick, and were removed to hospital ashore on the 18th.
On 16th November the third officer became ill. few mild oases developed after
this, but were isolated on board, and were of such a mild character that no details could
be obtained about them. The ship was ordered into quarantine for seven days’ observa-
tion. Medical inspection, temperature parade, and zinc sulphate inhalation were carried
out daily.
No influenza developed, and the ship, together with the crew, was released on the 16th
January, 1919.

Arrived Sydney, 14th January, 1919.
Source of infection, San Francisco.
History of Voyage. —The ship arrived in Sydney with crew as above, and 108 passengers
—first saloon, 65 ; second, 39 ; and third, 4. The ship’s surgeon reported that two days
after leaving San Francisco, i.e., 26th December, he was called to see Mr. S., a first class
passenger, who complained of headache, a pain in the back, and cough. Temperature,
99 ; later 100. He was put to bed and treated for bronchitis. On arrival at Honolulu
his condition had improved, and he went ashore. On returning to the ship that night,
he felt ill and had a rigor. The ship’s surgeon saw him at midnight; temperature, 102,
with pain over the left lung. Physical signs showed congestion of the left lung, and he
was spitting up prune juice sputum. His condition was diagnosed as croupous pneumonia,
but next morning—2lst December, he was isolated, with his wife, in the ship’s hospital,
aft, on the starboard side of the vessel, and given a mixed vaccine containing influenza
bacilli. v
His temperature became normal on sth January, and blood-stained sputum ceased.
On 11th January both he and his wife were released from isolation and allowed to mingle
with the other passengers. Both the patient and his wife were strictly isolated from the
other passengers from 31st December to 11th January, one steward being told off to
look after them.
On arrival at Sydney, the patient was examined, and found to have crepitations at
the base of the left lung, with dullness on percussion. His condition resembled closely,
cases after pneumonic influenza.
Before going sick, Mr. S. and his wife occupied cabin “ D ” on the promenade deck,
with bathroom attached. The ship’s surgeon reported that he had no case which ran a
temperature during the voyage, except the patient and one man who had a temperature
the night before reaching Pago. This man’s temperature was normal in the morning,
and he landed at Pago, well.
Medical inspection and thermometer parade were held of all on board, on arrival at
Sydney. No sign of influenza was found, and the ship was held for four days’ observation.
Medical inspection, thermometer parade, and zinc sulphate inhalation were carried
out daily. No further case developed and the ship was released, together with the
passengers and crew, on the 18th January, 1919.
Remarks. —From the history given and the examination of the patient on arrival at
Sydney there are good grounds for belief that this was a case of pneumonic influenza.
The prompt isolation on the ship and the fact that the patient and his wife had a cabin
to themselves possibly accounts for the fact that the disease did not spread through the
ship.

History of Voyage. —After leaving Port Said with a crew of 86 and 87 passengers, one
of the crew died of “ influenza meningitis.” He is supposed to have had influenza and
been treated in hospital on shore just previous to joining the ship. He became ill 14th
December, died 21st December, and was buried at sea.
The ship called at Melbourne on the 13th January, 1919, this being the first Australian
port of call. She was granted pratique and landed eleven persons. She left Melbourne
15th January, 1919, and arrived at Sydney on the 17th. Medical inspection and tempera-
ture parade was held by the Quarantine Officer, who found eight definite cases of coryza
and 30 people with a temperature of 99 or over. The ship was held for four days’ observa-
tion. Temperature parade, medical inspection, and zinc sulphate inhalation was carried
out daily. No influenza developed, and the ship was released, together with the passengers
and crew, on the 21st January, 1919.
Remarks. —ln the case of this ship there appears to be some doubt as to whether the
case was really one of influenza. The ship, however, had had cases on the previous
voyage.

Broome Report. —On arrival at Broome, seventeen cases of influenza were found to
have occurred on the ship, some of these cases being still ill. Pratique was withheld, and
the ship ordered and proceeded to Fremantle in quarantine. Fremantle was reached on
26th October, 1918. History of the cases is as follows : —On 13th October, the day of the
departure from Singapore, two cases occurred. No isolation was attempted, and fifteen
more cases had developed before the ship arrived at Broome. Persons affected were—
-2 officers (second and third engineer); 13 Asiatic crew (9 deck, 4 firemen); 2 first saloon
passengers.
Fremantle Report. —The native members of the crew were ill in bed from four to five
days ; the two engineers from two to three days. One first class passenger developed the
disease on 15th October, and was in bed until 24th October —two days before arrival
in Fremantle. He had severe bronchitis ; temperature, 100 to 104. Prior to joining
the ship this man had had malaria. On arrival at Fremantle all were normal, except
two Asiatics, who were recovering and still had temperatures. In addition, six members
of the Asiatic crew were found to have temperatures and were isolated as suspects, and
subsequently developed mild attacks of influenza. All people were landed from the ship
except an anchor watch of 32. On 4th November the Chinese cook died. All the other
cases were of a very mild character. On 3rd October the ship was released from
quarantine with all healthy contacts.
The Sub-collector of Customs at Broome boarded the ship on arrival at that port,
and remained on board several hours. He was, in consequence, placed in quarantine
for seven days for observation. He did not develop the disease.
One of the two first saloon passengers who developed the disease was obviously incu-
bating when he joined the ship at Singapore. Six cases occurred amongst the native
crew after leaving Broome—none after arrival Fremantle. Daily incidence unknown.

Called at Samarang 13th October, 1918,
Called at Darwin, 18th October, 1918.
Source of infection, Singapore.
History of Voyage. —On 10th October one day out from Singapore, influenza broke
out amongst the Malay crew, three men being affected on the first day and two more on
the second day. One Chinese boy was also affected, making six cases on arrival at
Samarang. The disease then rapidly spread through the Malay and Chinese boys living
in the forecastle, each day several new cases appearing, until eleven Malays and ten
Chinese boys were attacked.
None of the new hands signed on at Singapore this trip acquired the disease. The
Malays all recovered quickly, and had on arrival at Darwin been on duty for two or three
days. Three of the Chinese boys were then off duty.
The disease did not spread to the engine-room staff, who lived in the after part of the
ship, until the 14th October, that is, five days out from Singapore, and four days after
the crew living in the fore part of the ship had been attacked. But it spread very rapidly
amongst these men, twenty cases in all having been attacked before reaching Darwin.
Ten officers in all had been affected between the onset and arrival at Darwin, all except
one being then recovered. Eight passengers had been affected before reaching Darwin.
The distribution of cases amongst the crew was as follows :
Malay sailors —total number, 21 ; number of cases, 11.
Indian firemen —total number, 29 ; number of cases,. 20.
Chinese stewards—total number, 22 ; number of cases, 10.
European stewardess—total number, 1 ; number of cases, 1.
European officers—total number, 15 ; number of cases, 9.
Total cases, 51.
The distribution of cases amongst the passengers was as follows
Saloon—total number, 42 ; number of cases, 7.
Second class—total number, 43 ; number of cases, nil.
Deck —total number, 16 ; number of cases, 1.
Total cases, 8.
After leaving Darwin, all on board were subjected to daily inspection and daily
spraying of throats with disinfecting mixtures. The vessel continued the voyage in
quarantine as far as Sydney, which was the terminal port. Sydney was reached on Ist
November—crew, 56 ; passengers, 55—and on arrival there were six cases of pneumonic
influenza amongst .the native crew. All were admitted to hospital on the Ist November,
and discharged on the 13th.
The ship was released on the 3rd November, and the contacts on the Bth.
Remarks. —The infectious nature of the disease is illustrated by the fact that there
occurred a total of 59 cases within a period of eight days amongst a total exposed popu-
lation of 198 persons. There is some reason for believing that amongst this number of
198 there were some who had recently suffered from the complaint before joining the
ship. Influenza was reported to have been very prevalent at Singapore about the time
of the departure of the vessel. The distribution of the cases suggests speculation as to the
reason why the epidemic should have terminated after less than one-third of the total
population of the vessel had contracted the disease. The daily treatment could hardly
have been more than a contributing factor, as most of the cases had become convalescent
and the distribution had been so wide throughout the ship that any susceptible person
had ample opportunity for developing the disease.
32. Houtman.
Dutch royal mail steamer trading between Java and Melbourne, via Australian ports.
Vessel left Batavia on 27th October, calling at Balikpapan, with a crew of 157 and
83 passengers. After leaving Batavia, three saloon passengers developed influenza —
one each on 22nd, 24th, and 27th respectively.
Vessel arrived at Brisbane on 7th November, without any further cases having de-
veloped, and with all the three above cases fully convalescent. The evidence goes to
show that the infection was contracted ashore before leaving Java.
The dates would appear to indicate a two-day incubation period.
Vessel arrived at Sydney on 10th November, and at Melbourne on 13th November,
being quarantined at each place. No further case was reported until the period of quaran-
tine was completed.

at Zamboanga on 22nd October. In all, twelve cases were reported, but other cases are
said to have occurred during the voyage. The cases among the Japanese passengers
were landed at Zamboanga on 22nd October, after wh ch no further case was reported.
The symptoms noted by the ship’s surgeon were high temperature (103 to 10-1 degrees),
pulse 110 to 120, headache, and cough lasting some days. The ship was ordered into
quarantine at Sydney for seven days’ observation. Daily medical inspection and
temperature parades were held, and zinc sulphate inhalation administered. No fuither
case of influenza developed, and the ship was released from quarantine on 10th November,
1918.
Passengers and crew underwent their quarantine on board the ship owing to lack of
accommodation at the Quarantine Station.

Called at Fremantle 29th October, 1918 ; took on 165 additional troops, making a
total of 931 troops.
„ Durban 16th November, 1918 ; left 24th November, 1918.
Returned to Fremantle 11th December, 1918.
Source of infection, Durban.
History of the Voyage, —The Roonah arrived at Durban on 16th November, 1918, and
laid in the harbor till 24th November, 1918. The vessel was ordered into quarantine
some time after arrival, and no one was allowed on shore. Fifteen men who escaped
ashore on a raft were not allowed to return to the vessel. No member of the troops or
the crew went ashore and returned to the vessel. On the other hand, by order of the
Naval Authorities, any one who had business on board the vessel was allowed to go on
the ship from the shore. When the first of these attempted to board they were refused
permission, but the Captain was ordered by signal to allow them to come on board. The
vessel was coaled by a large number of natives, about 100, who mixed freely with the
troops. The coaling was carried through No. 3 hatch, which passes through the stewards
quarters, while mails were worked through No. 2 hatch, in between the sergeants mess
and the hospital. The first case was developed amongst the troops. The other people
to board the vessel from the shore were several Naval officers, agent, warrant officers,
A.I.F. assistant paymasters, Y.M.C.A. representatives, ships’ chandlers, coal merchants,
and so on. On 29th November, five days after leaving Durban, three cases were isolated,
and were diagnosed on 30th November as influenza. Previous to this cases diagnosed
as tonsilitis had occurred after leaving Durban, and these were probably mi d cases o
influenza. Whether the disease was brought on board by the natives or by the whites
is not known, but the former were in far greater numbers, and described as being dirty
and dilapidated. Two hundred and ninety-eight cases of influenza occurred on the voyage
from Durban to Fremantle. The disease spread rapidly when it had made its appearance,
due probably to the inadequate isolation accommodation. Only ten beds in one ward
were provided for all infectious disease, including venereal disease. The portion set
aside for a general hospital also contained a sergeants’ mess, cells, guard-room, and
A.M.C mess All sick parades had to be held on the hatch used by the sergeants, ihe
largest number in hospital at one time was 180 cases, and of these 93 had a temperature
of over 104.
Preventative measures were adopted early, each day after leaving Durban all troops
were put through the inhalation chamber, and the temperature of any man who complained
of headache or sore throat was taken. These measures were taken on amount of a case
considered to be spinal meningitis which had been landed at Durban on 16th Novemb ,
1918. As far as practicable, the following places were added to the isolation area :
(a) General hospital.
(b) Gun platform aft roofed in by a tarpaulin.
(c) Lower bridge deck —starboard side.
(d) No. 2 hatch.
(e) Sergeants’ mess.
(/) Guard room and cells.
Character of Disease.— The disease was characterized accordingjto the S.M.O s report
by marked pain in the back (lumbar region) and limbs, headache, ep^tax lB (a very common
symptom), and pyrexia, lasting on an average about five days. In many cases *
temperature exceeded 104 degrees. On board ship chest complications were remarkable
for their absence. .

Fremantle Report. —The vessel arrived at Fremantle on the 14th December, 1918.
The history was obtained of 83 cases of influenza having been admitted to hospital on the
first seven days of the voyage. Ninety cases in all were treated. The average length of


stay in hospital was four days. Many men from Egypt had influenza on embarking.
The last case was admitted on the 4th December, 1918. An extract from the report of
the senior medical officer showed that the hospital accommodation on the ship consisted
of fifteen beds in the main hospital and ten beds in the isolation ward, totally insufficient.
Sick men had to be accommodated on the deck and on a hatchway on the troop deck.
For the week ending 25th November, 1918, the average number of patients in hospital,
including the crew, were 68, and 86 was the largest number at one time. The hospital
was badly ventilated, situated at the stern end of the boat, where the noise and jolting
of the screw made it very uncomfortable for patients, and impossible to examine their
chests with any certainty.
The three men landed at Colombo were suffering from malaria (two cases) and fractured
skull (one case). Two deaths took place from influenza, one on the 21st November, 1918,
influenza and heart failure, the second on the 22nd November, 1918, influenza and
pneumonia. Both these men were sick on embarkation, the first man reporting ill straight
away.

28th December, 1918. Inhalation chamber was fitted on board, and crew and passengers
inhaled daily for ten minutes during their stay in quarantine. No cases of influenza
having developed, the vessel was released from quarantine 24th December, 1918.

Report oe Voyage by Senior Medical Officer.
General Health. —The general health of troops during the voyage, with the exception
of the outbreak of influenza, soon after embarkation, has been good.
Influenza was rife in England at the time of embarkation.
Troops were embarked on 19th October at Devonport. On the 20th the first case
showed itself, and two men, Corporal R.R. and Private F.M.H., were evacuated to hospital.
They were both of a very severe type.
Cases developed rapidly, and proved after a few days to be of a very severe type.
Amongst the troops 120 cases occurred. A large proportion of these were of a milfl type—
illness lasting but a few days. Then came another class of a severe type with no or very
slight lung complications. The most severe cases were of great intensity with marked
toxaemia, 23 cases were complicated by pneumonia, a greater number being of the broncho-
pneumonia type, and some with a definite lobar condition. A few of the cases developed
pneumonia very early, and lived but a few days, the shortest being only three days in the
hospital. A feature in a few cases was cyanosis.

Melbourne —arrived 29th December, 1918.
Source of infection, England.
Embarkation was completed at Devonport on 20th October. At that time there was
an outbreak of influenza amongst the ship’s crew, and as a result sailing was postponed
until 7th November. During the delay influenza broke out amongst the military personnel.
It is probable that infection, already on the ship, was also reintroduced by the troops
embarked. During the period 20th October to Ist November 89 cases occurred, 4of
which died. The daily number of cases occurring were as follow :

After Ist November there were no further cases. The senior medical officer reports
that “ as soon as the outbreak manifested itself, vigorous preventative treatment was
instituted, main reliance being placed on naso-pharyngeal disinfection, carried on by
means of inhalation of 1 per cent, formaldehyde solution atomised by steam from pipe
connected with engine-room. For the first week, the personnel were paraded foi spraying
twice daily, thence to Capetown once daily, weather permitting. After departure from
Capetown'all ranks were sprayed for seven days. It is considered that this method of
prevention of infection has proved effective.” In support of this opinion the senior
medical officer refers to the table of admissions showing that the cases fell immediately
after the spraying commenced.
History of the Voyage . —Eighty-nine cases of influenza occurred amongst troops, last
case occurring Ist November, 1918. Fifty cases influenza amongst crew, last case

man had been ill on the 3rd and had left the boat at Wallaroo and, although it was
difficult to get reliable statements from the ship’s staff, there is satisfactory evidence that
more cases than those had developed—probably about half of the crew. The vessel was
