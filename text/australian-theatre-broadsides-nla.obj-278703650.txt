Dr, Williams' Pink Pills i Pale People
AN ANAEMIC LADY’S TROUBLES.
(From the Balmain Observer.)
Mrs. Lardelli, a fine handsome woman of about 35 years of age, said to a
reporter of the Balmain Observer, who called upon her to get particulars of an illness
through which she had just passed, “ I am quite well now, and don’t think I ever
enjoyed better health —thanks to Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People ; but I
was very bad indeed. The first start of my illness was loss of appetite, and as I
also began to feel a bit low in spirits occasionally, and also was growing rather pale,
I went to a chemist. ‘ Why,’ he said, ‘ You’re ansemic,’ and he showed me in the
looking-glass how white my gums were getting, also the bad color of the inside of
my eyelids. He said, ‘You want a strong tonic,’ and he gave me one. How-
ever, I continued to get paler and more sickly-looking, my appetite grew gradually
less and less till I felt I hardly cared whether I ate anything or not, and when I did
manage to get a little food down, it seemed to stick like a hard lump on my chest.
I was losing flesh rapidly, and was growing so weak that I could hardly get out
of bed in the mornings, and when I did do a little work, it knocked me up com-
pletely, and I had to go and lie down on the bed to recover. At last everything
became a trouble to me, and I got into a low, hopeless sort of state, and hardly
cared what became of me. Nearly all the time I had suffered from a peculiar dull
pain in my back, so I made an effort and went to another chemist and asked him
■what this pain meant. He told me my liver was out of order, and he gave me
some pills and medicine ; but these did me no
good at all. Altogether I suppose I must have
tried a dozen different kinds of medicine with-
out any good effect. You have no idea what a
wretched stal.'a I was in by t-his time. I used
to lie down all day on the sofa, hardly able to
move anything but my eyes. However, I could
read, and it was because of an account of
a remarkable cure that I saw in the Daily
Telegraph that I decided to try Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills for Pale People. I sent my
daughter for a box. In less than a week’s
time there was a great difference, I can
assure you. My friends congratulated me on a
change for the better in my appearance. I
continued the pills, and very soon I was able
to do a little work again. My appetite came
back, and a slight tinge of color appeared in my
cheeks. I got slowly, but surely, better every
day, and in about two months’ time was com-
pletely cured, and felt as brisk and lively
as a girl of 18. As I have said before, Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People did this
for me when lots of other medicines failed to do me any good at all, and I shall
always recommend them to my friends. I give my full permission to the Dr.
Williams’ Medicine Company to publish the facts of my cure wherever and when-
ever they may think fit. E. LARDELLI.”
Dr Williams’ Pink Pills have a remarkable efficacy in curing diseases
arising from an impoverished condition of the blood or an impairment
of the nervous system, such as rheumatism, neuralgia, partial paralysis,
locomotor ataxia, St. Vitus’ dance, nervous headache, nervous prostra-
tion, and the tired feeling arising therefrom, the after effects of la
grippe, influenza, and severe colds, diseases depending on humors in the
blood, such as scrofula, chronic erysipelas, &c. Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
give a healthy glow to pale and sallow complexions, and are a specific
for the troubles peculiar to the female system; and in the case of men
they effect a radical cure in all cases arising from mental worry, over-
work, and excesses of any nature.

To make your house habitable and convenient

Du Maurier was a thorough worshipper
of beauty, as one can see from “ Trilby,”
The splendid specimens of womanhood
he used to sketch in Punch also show
this. He was no admirer of delicacy, but
loved to see well-developed frames. His
chief models were his wife and daughters.
Domestic Incident.—“ Wow ! ” It was
Mr. Newpop. He had taken a mouthful
of water melon. “ Marie, what the d-deuce
is the matter with this melon ? ” “ Doesn’t
it taste good, George?” “No; tastes
like a hot wind. What’s the matter with
it ? ” “ Well, yon know, George, the doc-
tor said to—and —and—” “ You boiled
it ! Oh ! ” , Mr. Newpop settled down in
Ms chair and cross-eyed at the ceiling for
a few minutes ; then arose and walked un-
steadily into the open air.
Old Bullion—“ What! You wish to

Teacher —“ Where do the Arabs live ? ”
Boy—“In the desert.” Teacher—“ What
do they call those pious men who flee to

There are two violet farms in the
United States, both managed entirely by

Hitherto Patient Boarder “ Mrs.

‘ The dear, dear girls,” exclaimed Mrs.

daughters enthusiastically. “ Yes, the
dear, dear girl,” muttered Mr. Pawkins
despondently.
Douglas Jerrold, the famous wit, once remarked—
“ Tickle the Earth with a hoe , and she laughs with the Harvest .”
Many years have elapsed since this quaint remark was made, but it is tolerably certain

(furiously)—“ By the powers, no more

O’Doolan! Wan button too much at the
top, an’ wan buttonhole too many at
the bottom! ” Mrs. O’Doolan —Why, ye
auld phule, ye’ve buttoned it up wrong.
It’s a strait weskit would suit ye ! ”
Family friend: “ I congratulate you,
my dear sir, on the marriage of your
daughter. I see you are gradually getting
all the girls off your hands.” Old Olive-
branch : “ Off my hands—yes ; but the
worst of it is, I have to keep all their
husbands on their feet.”
Among the English nobility 19 per

Mirages.
There are few phenomena in nature so
striking as mirages, whether they take
the form of the palm groves seen across
a desert, as, for instance, in going through
the Suez Canal, or of portents in the sky
like that wonderful storm-blow figuring
in the three crosses of Calvary, which
forms the frontispiece of Mr. Whymper’s
“ Scrambles in the Alps.” A species of
mirage commonly seen across lakes in
fine weather is the Fata Morgana , whereby
diminutive cottages are magnified into
gorgeous fairy palaces, rocks become pin-
nacles, and so on. M. Delebecque has
recently been making an examination intc
the causes of this phenomenon, and has
communicated his researches to the
Academic des Sciences. He finds that if
the magnified object be scrutinised
through a telescope it resolves itself into
a number of separate superposed images
which cannot be distinguished by the eye.
Moreover, it may happen that only one
rorlion of the object is magnified at a
time; thus he has seen a boat with double
hull and normal sails suddenly transform
itself into a single hull with gigantic
spread of canvas. As many as five
images may be reflected at the same time.
The mirage also occasionally takes the
reverse form, of diminishing objects
looked at. It occurs most frequently
when the temperature of the air is higher
than that of the lake.

ITS SPECIAL WORK.
The liver is a fibrous, glandular body, and its special duty is to remove noxious and poisonous matter from the blood. It
also secretes and furnishes the bile, which is one of the indispensable elements for the digestion of food.
The symptoms of a sound liver are cheerfulness of mind and perfect healthfulness and vigour of the whole body. Of one
thing the reader may be certain ; if anything be wrong with him or her there are just about five chances to the hundred that it can
be anything else than liver trouble. a
When the liver has gone wrong, symptoms vary greatly in different persons Other organs are extremely liable to suffer in
sympathy, and when this happens, many misguided sufferers make the mistake of using medicines for these effects instead of apply-
ing the proper remedy at the fountain head of their sufferings—that is to say, at the liver. The proper remedy to take in such
oases is Bilk Bkans for Biliousness, which get right down to the cause.

“ Does your wife call you as many pet
names as she did when you were first

ones.”
Some time ago the play of “ Hamlet ”
was performed at an English provincial
theatre. In a scene with Polonius the
crafty old courtier asks, “ Do you know
me, ray lord ? ” And the Prince responds,
“ Excellent well; you are a fishmonger.”
On hearing this an old woman in the pit
stood up, and shaking her fist, shouted
excitedly, “Well, and s’posing he is?
That’s better than play acting any day.”
“ I have here a neat and pretty little
letter-opener,” began the agent. “So
have I at home,” said the business-man,
sadly, “ I am married.”
Didn’t Like the Game. —Farmer Green
—“ Don’t be skeered, miss ! The cow is
only playful.” Miss Ancient (out of
breath) —*• I never played with a cow in
my life, man, and I am not going to
begin now.”
“ Well, father,” exclaimed the prodiga
son, as he made his appearance at the
family fireside, “are you ready to kill
the fatted calf ? ” “ No,” replied the old
man grimly, “I think I’ll let you live.
Four persons are killed weekly in the
streets of the metropolis, and a score or
two are injured.
Five shillings a week dyes not seem much,
but for that sum you can get £lO worth of
furniture from FORSSB-SRG’S, 78 William
Street. See how far that will go to make your

The sale of Gilbey’s Dry Gin in New South
Wales five times exceeds that of any other
brand, and it is daily increasing in popularity.
It enjoys the same popular call in the other col-
onies, other competing brands being nowhere.
Gilbey’s Dry Gin is specially recommended by
doctors for kidney and allied maladies. Taken
with a dash of Angostura, or with Soda or Ginger
Beer, it is a most refreshing and wholesome
stimulant.
Tobacco quickly absorbs any odour
with which it is brought in contact.
The Belgians are the greatest potato-
eaters, and the Irish come second.
Electric Lighting in Bolton.
The demand for electricity in Bolton
has grown rapidly since its introduction
by the Corporation; and the recent
adoption of what is known as the Brighton
scale of charges promises to give such a
stimulus to the public demand that it has
been decided to spend an additional
£30,000 on the extension of the works
and plant. The revised scale places the
electric light within the means of the in-
dustrial classes, and before long it is
expected that many working men’s homes
in the town will be lighted by electricity
in place of gas.
