The North Shore Bridge,
August 24, 1929.
Photograph by Bostock.
Because the North Shore Bridge is' of such interest to all Australians,
PEAPES include in this new Catalogue, a picture which shows the stage of
its development at the moment of going to press. PEAPES suggest that the
Catalogue be retained, as next year they will again illustrate the advancement
of this gigantic work towards completion.
PEAPES have utilised photographs on living models to portray the new season’s
styles, so that they Can be seen as they actually appear in wear.
PEAPES’ policy of better QUALITY, better VALUE and better SERVICE
has been rigidly maintained. PEAPES do not conduct sales and are there"
fore enabled to mark all their goods at a definitely low alhthe'yeanround price
which has not to provide for “reductions”.
PEAPES, who sponsored the movement towards lighter clothes for men in
Australia, direct special attention to the outer and under wear of very light
weight on the page" devoted to tailoring, ready"tO"wear clothing, shirts and
underwear.


THE SEASON’S MOST FAVOURED STYLES

LIGHT, COOL, DURABLE BRITISH UNDERWEAR
It is not only in outer wear that PEAPES aim at achieving
the utmost lightness. The present demand for lighter
clothing of every description is reflected in this cool Summer
underwear, many of the styles being sleeveless, and all of
them negligible in weight, though most reliable in quality.
