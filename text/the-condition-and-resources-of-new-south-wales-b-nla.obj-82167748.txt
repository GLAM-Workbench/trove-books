THE CONDITION AND RESOURCES
NEW SOUTH WALES.
The following paper on the resources of New South Wales was
read by Christopher Rollestoh, Esq., Auditor General
and formerly Registrar General of the Colony, before the
Royal Society of New South Wales, on Wednesday,
12th December, 1866.
CONDITION AND RESOURCES OE NEW SOUTH
WALES.
At a time when we are suffering from a depression
which has paralyzed trade and destroyed confi-
dence, it may not be inopportune to review our
position, and to endeavour, by means of ascer-
tained facts, to reassure ourselves as to the solidity
of our resources.
We are enabled to do this by means of the data
supplied in the Statistical Register for the year
1805, lately presented to Parliament. I think, if
we carefully look at the results which that volume
places before us, we shall find reason to acknow-
ledge that the panic which has seized the commu-
nity (let people attribute it to what cause they
may) is not justified by the failure of any one of
our main sources of wealth, I do not purpose to
A 2


trace this depression under which the colony is
labouring to its primary causes. lam satisfied to
fall in with the general opinion that we are suffer-
ing from the effect of previous overtrading and
extravagance. This is no new thing. Young
and vigorous communities like ours are peculiarly
liable to fluctuations of this kind. Depression
follows excitement as naturally in the body social
as in the body physical, and I know of nothing in
the climate or constitution of New South Wales
which should exempt us from this law. A bank
director told me the other day, that very few per-
sons were sensible of the imminence of the crisis
through which we had passed, aggravated as it
was by the unexpected demands for assistance by
our own Government, as well as that of Queens-
land. Luckily we have tided over the crisis in
happy ignorance of the danger, feeling its effects
only in a little temporary depression. But what
we call u depression,? ?how does it manifest itself?
It seems to me that if the same state of things of
which we are complaining were to exist in the
older countries of Europe, it would be to them a
season of comparative wealth and prosperity.
Tell me what class is there amongst us which
cannot command more of the comforts?aye, and
luxuries too ?of life than the denizens of most
other countries enjoy. I ask you to go with me
on any public holiday to the haunts of pleasure-
seekers in and about our beautiful harbour?to


Manly Beach or Watson?s Bay, or to see a cricket
match in the Domain, or at the Albert Cricket
Ground, or where else you will?and will you see
evidences of this ? depression ? there ? We have
no statistics to demonstrate the existence of any
depression in this direction, and our ordinary
senses fail to discover it. Take a walk with me
down George Street, and look at the display of
fashion in the fashionable shop windows, and
notice the private equipages, more or less hand-
some, drawn up in files at the doors, with gor-
geously appareled ladies stepping into or step-
ping out of them, and with trains that
caution one to stand off and keep clear. I ask
whether there is u any evidence of depression
here!? On the contrary, my observation leads
me to believe ?and I am sorry again that I am
unable to reduce my belief to a matter of certainty
by the light of those vulgar things called statistics
?that private equipages, from the fashionable
barouche to the American buggy, have multiplied
exceedingly in our metropolis within the last three
or four years 5 and, moreover, in articles of dress
and millinery display, and particularly in the
grotesque designs and elaborate variety of that
important female appendage miscalled a bonnet,
I think it will be allowed that our fashionable
shops exceed, this season, anything that has been
known before.
I don?t know that there has been any noticeable


diminution in the number of private balls or
dinner parties, nor in any of our public enter-
tainments during the past season ; on the contrary,
I believe that the Opera was never better patron-
ised, and performers of any merit seem to have
enjoyed a fair share of public support. Suspicious
looking hampers seem to be very prevalent at the
present time, apparently filled with the choicest
viands, en route for the various picnic grounds
which at this season invite the almost daily enjoy-
ment of our citizens; indeed, so numerous are
they, that pedestrians like myself are in some
danger of being knocked down by them in passing
the doors of the principal grocers in town every
Saturday morning. Look, again, at the number
of houses of entertainment in the city?why, every
twentieth house is one. It was so many years
ago, and I hardly think any one will venture to
say that they have decreased. And the number
of photographic galleries! How are all these
supported? How many thousands must weekly
visit the photographers to afford support to so
many ? Look, again, at your churches and chapels
and cathedrals. Never has so great an activity
and earnestness been evinced by all denominations
in the erection and enlargement of places of public
worship as has marked the course of the last two
or three years. Nor have they been wanting in
evidences of philanthropy and enlarged benevo-
lence. Look at our contributions to the Lancashire


Relief Fund, to tlie erection of that beautiful statue
of the late Prince Consort, and, later still, to the un-
fortunate sufferers by the late severe wrecks on our
coast, and to the many other almost daily objects
of local charity, and tell me, do these bear any evi-
dence of depression ? If they do, it is an evidence
that does the highest credit to the good feeling of
the people of this colony ?an evidence that their
charities and public subscriptions are not restricted
by fortuitous circumstances, nor circumscribed by
straitened means, but are regulated upon the
principle of a large-hearted benevolence, which,
demanding the exercise of no small amount of
self-abnegation, can proceed from no other motives
than those of the warmest philanthropy.
But I am told that property is being sold for a
third of its value ; that mortgagees are foreclosing
in all directions, to the utter ruin of the unfortunate
mortgagors. Well, it may be so, and it has been
so from time immemorial; and it will be so again.
Individuals suffer, but the community at large is
benefited. But let me ask how this value is to be
arrived at. This is an important consideration in
working out this question.
Who does not recollect the extravagant compe-
tition for land, at the Government sales, some
eight or ten years ago ; and that still more extra-
vagant demand made, aye, and obtained, too, by
private speculators. Why, no one was satisfied
unless he had a suburban residence, and enjoyed


tlie shade of his own vine and his own fig-tree.
And at what cost was this taste satisfied ?
Who does not remember that in those days
skilled labour commanded from fifteen shillings to
a guinea a day, and that the price of materials, of
all kinds, wherewith to build up one of these pala-
tial villas was enormously enhanced by the arti-
ficial plethora of the gold-times ! And yet, forsooth,
we are to be astonished when one of these places
is forced into the market?that it does not realise
more than one-half or one-third of its cost. Surely,
a little reflection should satisfy us, that the hard-
earned savings of the honest industry of these
sober days, are not to be saddled with the cost of
the prolific extravagance of years gone by; and
that we are not to conclude that the country is
going to ruin because Mr. Jones?s very handsome
residence, erected at a cost of �lO,OOO eight or ten
years ago, passes into Mr. Brown?s or Mr. Eobin-
son?s hands for one half of that sum. Mr. Brown
or Mr. Robinson gets the advantage of the lavish
expenditure of Mr. Jones. That?s all. The com-
munity at large is not impoverished. I say then
that let people account for this so-called depression
in what way they will, you won?t find evidences
of it in the shops and warehouses which line your
streets, nor in the palatial residences of your sub-
urbs, nor in the equipages in which your wealthy
citizens are wont to take their airing, nor yet in
the public or private amusements got up for the
recreation of the general class of citizens.


But let us descend from tlie region of hypothesis
to plain facts and figures. I will ask you to go
back with me at present no further than the year
1860, because we then start fair with New South
Wales in geographical limits, as it exists at the
present time. If I were to go further back, I
should involve you in perplexity, and expose my
figures to doubts and questions as to the effect
which the separation and erection of the northern
districts into a separate colony ought to have upon
them, and I have no wish to enter upon the domain
of the Queensland statistician. It is enough for
our purpose to know that at the end of the year
1859, New South Wales was deprived of the
larger portion of her territory, and with it of some
23,000 of her inhabitants, some two and a half to
three millions of sheep, besides cattle and horses,
and that on the Ist December of that year, from
these comparatively small beginnings, there has
risen up on our Northern frontier a vigorous and
thriving community?supported, it is true, in great
part, by Sydney capital, and going ahead, as young
people are apt to do, a little too fast?which chal-
lenges comparison in its progress and development
with that of any of the colonies forming the Aus-
tralian group. We will take, therefore, a review
of the last six years (1860 to 1865 both inclusive),
and endeavour to arrive at some approximate idea
as to the progress we have made during that
period.


1. Population.
On the Ist of January, 1860, then we start with
a population of 336,572* souls; and on the 31st
December, 1865, (six years afterwards), the Returns
give us an estimated population, made up by an
increase of births over deaths, and immigration
over emigration, of 411,388, showing an increase
of 74,816, or 22 per cent.
In 1860 our vital Statistics showed an accession
to the population by births of 14,233. In 1865
the births amounted to 17,283, which exhibits an
increased power of reproduction within ourselves
of over 21 per cent. Of the total increase of
74,816 to the population since the separation of
Queensland, 56,068, or 75 per cent., is to be set
down to the natural increase by the excess of
births over deaths. On reference to the report of
the Immigration Agent for 1865, 1 find that he
puts down the excess of arrivals over departures
from and to Great Britain at 19,829 in the six
years, that is at the rate of 3305 per annum. This
information will be agreeable to those who favour
the doctrine of Australia for the Australians, since
it shows to them that one-fourth only of the ad-
dition to our numbers has been made up from
what they call foreign sources. It has been main-
tained, however, by the Registrar-General of Vic-
toria, and our own statistics would seem to bear
* Estimated population on 31st December, 1859.


out Lis conclusion, that wages and immigration
Lave declined pretty much in the same ratio.
Wages have never been so high in either colony as
in those years when the tide of immigration set in
most strongly. But this is a question upon which
I am not here going to enter, as it would lead me
very wide of the object of this paper.
Although our progress in population has not
kept pace with that of our enterprising young off-
shoot in the north, nor yet with our older offshoot
in the south, we should not forget that we occupy
a country, much of it of the richest quality, which
embraces over five hundred acres of land for every
man, woman, and child in it, and which, without
exceeding the density of the population as it now
exists in the county of Cumberland, exclusive of
Sydney, will admit of a population exceeding fif-
teen millions of souls, or nearly forty times the
number of its present inhabitants. When we
reflect on this fact, and consider the enormous field
which is thus offered for the extension of the in-
dustry and enterprise of the colonists, we cannot
but regard our present difficulties as the result of
a plethora of credit rather than of a diminution of
wealth, as having little or no serious effect upon
the general prosperity, and as being of a very
evanescent character. I will now pass on to a
review of our resources under the next head of
inquiry, namely,


2. Production.
Under this head I will take, first, the pastoral
interest, and endeavour to show how great has
been our progress in this branch of industry.
Sheep, of course, is the mainstay of the pastoral
interest, and it appears that after the separation of
Queensland, with its two millions and a half of
sheep, we were left with a stock of 5,102,671 sheep
on the 31st March, 1800, this being the date upon
which the returns for the year are made up. Well,
what accumulation have we to show as the result
of our six years? breeding? Well-founded doubts
having arisen as to the accuracy of the figures in
the statistical tables of the Eegistrar-General, I
take my figures from the returns made by the
sheep proprietors to the clerks of Petty Sessions,
and verified by solemn declaration under the Scab
in Sheep Act (27 Vic. No. 6). I find, then, from
these?returns that we had on the Ist January,
exclusive of small lots under five hundred, in the
hands of butchers and others, no less than
11,100,245, that is to say, an increase in the six
years of 5,937,574 sheep, equal to 115 per cent.
The declared returns of the previous year show
that we had 10,075,468 sheep. We may therefore
fairly assume that we are increasing our sheep at
the rate of over a million annually, and our staple
produce to the extent of not far short of three
millions pounds of wool, which, at eighteen pence
per pound, is equal to a sum of �225,000.


When we consider the boundless area in the far
interior still unsubdued and unoccupied?when we
reflect upon what has already been done by the
enterprise of the sheep-holders in the expenditure
of capital to bring large tracts of unwatered coun-
try into use by means of wells and dams; and,
further, the large addition to the carrying capabi-
lities of the country, by fencing and other improve-
ments, I am not exaggerating in estimating the
doubling of our present stock within the next six
years as a not improbable prospect.
Our export of wool last year, seaward and via
the Darling for Adelaide, and across the Murray
for Melbourne, was as follows, viz,:
Seaward .... 25,961,408
Less imports from Queensland and elsewhere . 7,208,501
Leaving .... 18,772,960
To this add quantity sent via Darling River
and across the Murray, viz.,
Albury . . ? 403,765
Corowa . ? ? 879,017
Moama . ? . 6,907,661
Swan Hill ? . ? ? 1,385,916
Euston . .. ? 156,800
Wentworth . . . 1,555,600
11,288,752
Making a total of . . . 30,061,719
Assuming this quantity of wool to represent the


clip of 1865, it gives a yield of very nearly three
pounds per sheep, and averaging the quantity at
the rate of one shilling and sixpence per pound
(which I am advised is not an excessive average),
we arrive at the value of �2,254,628.
It is a point worth noticing in connection with
our export of wool, that over 37 per cent of the
clip was shipped last year at the ports of Mel-
bourne and Adelaide. Certainly a very large
proportion, and suggestive of careful consideration
as to the means to be adopted to intercept this
traffic, and bring it down to our own ports; for it
must be recollected that it is not only the loss
connected with the export of this produce which
we suffer, but the loss upon the importation,
agency, and other business connected with the
return supplies to the stations.
I have not the means of testing the accuracy of
the returns of horses and cattle, and must there-
fore accept the figures as stated in the statistical
tables. And here it is only fair to the Registrar-
General to state that he is dependent on the police
for the collection of his annual returns of agricul-
ture and live-stock, and that he cannot be held
responsible for the accuracy of information, over
the collection of which he has no control whatever.
If the returns are accurate they show a diminution
in the number of cattle in the colony. We started
in 1860 with 2,190,976, and we find ourselves in
1866 with only 1,961,905. I cannot say that the


returns are inaccurate, but since tlie sheep returns
appear to be under stated to the extent of some-
thing like 27 per cent, it is not unreasonable to
assume that the cattle have been short reckoned
in pretty much the same ratio, and that our
numbers ought to have exceeded two millions and
a half at the time the returns were taken.
The decrease, if it really exists, can only be a ssigned
to the effect of the pleuro-pneumonia and the last
two years? drought combined. Great losses from
both causes have been suffered, but, looking to
large natural increase, it can hardly be to the
extent which these figures would indicate. But,
be this as it may, we possessed at the end of last
year five (5) head of horned cattle, more or less,
and 27 sheep, for every man, woman, and child
in the colony?or for every 100 of the population
600 cattle and 2700 sheep.
The agricultural statistics for Ireland for the
1861 showed only 61 sheep, and 60 head of cattle,
to every 100 of the population.
I dare say some of you may remember to have
heard or read Sir William Denison?s paper on the
supply of meat, in which he endeavoured to show
that, supposing the number of mouths went on
increasing in the same ratio as it had done, these
colonies were not producing beef and mutton
enough to keep pace with the increasing popula-
tion. This was in 1858, and the figures he quoted
were as follows, viz.:?.


Sheep. Cattle.
New South Wales, including Queensland 8,139,162 2,148,664
Victoria . . . 4,76G,022 614,537
Totals . . 12,905,184 2,7G3,201
If his Excellency were now here, he would find
that the sheep had more than doubled, whilst the
cattle had increased by 20 per cent, taking the
returns as they stand, viz.:?
Sheep ? Cattle.
New South Wales . . 11,100,245 1,961,905
Victoria . . . 8,835,380 621,337
Queensland . . . G,594,966 848,346
Totals . . 26,530,591 3,431,588
It is quite clear, from these figures, that the
colony of Victoria cannot supply herself with
beef, since her herds are nearly the same now as
they were eight years ago, and we know that she
has been drawing annually large supplies of fat
cattle from this colony. And there is a further
fact connected with the breeding and export of
cattle well deserving attention, which is this: that
it is not alone Victoria, but Tasmania, New Zea-
land, and South Australia are making large
demands upon our herds, whilst a market is being
opened up in Batavia and elsewhere for our beef ?
not to mention the probable exhaustion of our
herds, if my friend Mr. Tooth?s process succeeds,
by which it is said you will be able to put two or
three bullocks at once into your waistcoat pocket.
Think of that ye cattle breeders!


The notice of the pastoral returns would be in-
complete were I to omit any mention of the export
of live stock, tallow, hides, and skins, which forms
an important feature in the returns of our pastoral
industry. It was as follows, viz., for the year
1865, valued at?
Live stock seaward . . . �ll3 203
Ditto ditto overland . . _ 672 037
Together
�785,240
Salt beef
21,123
123,266
Tallow, including candles
Bones, hoofs, and horns
9,196
Leather, manufactured and unmanufactured
Skins, sheep and cattle
31,124
73,825
�1,043,774
Add to this the value of the export of wool as pre-
viously stated . . . 2,254,628
We arrive at a sum total for our pastoral exports
for the year 1865 of
�3,298,402
This, moreover, is entirely irrespective of the
meat, tallow, &c., used for home consumption, and
of a million annually to the number of our sheep.
Agriculture.
The disasters which have befallen the formers
during the last three or four years have had a
very depressing effect upon this most important
interest. For two years the agriculturists suffered


from the effects of devastating floods, which have
been followed by two years of severe droughts.
Therefore, taking into consideration the sore dis-
couragements under which they have laboured, it
is a wonder to find that so much progress has been
made in this branch of industry. Since the sepa-
ration of Queensland we have increased oui land
under tillage from 247,542 acres in 1859 to
378,254 acres in 1865, an increase of 53 per cent
in the six years. But this is very poor progiess
compared with our neighbours in Victoria and
South Australia.
If we compare the tillage for wheat of the last
four years with the four years preceding ?for it is
in our attempts to supply ourselves with bread
that we have most conspicuously failed, we shall
see the extent to which our efforts have been frus-
trated.
The average of the first four years (1858 to
1861) gives us 115,743 acres under wheat, and a
yield of 1,589,629 bushels, equal to 14 bushels
per acre, rather more than half the quantity
required for home consumption; whilst the aver-
age of the second four years (1862 to 1865) gives
112,750 acres under wheat, with a yield of
1,031,048, equal to 9 bushels per acre only, or
rather under a third of the quantity required for
home consumption. If the returns then afford a
reliable basis for drawing a conclusion, we can
arrive at no other than this, that the discourage-


ments to wheat growing have been found to over-
come the encouragements which the liberal land
legislation of the country holds out for the sup-
plying from our own soil the food necessary for
the sustenance of the people.
It should be observed, however, that much of
the land sown for grain during the last year or
two has been cut for hay, and thus the average
under sown grasses has been augmented at the
expense of the wheat crop.
Let us see to what extent it was deemed prudent
to supplement the home produce of wheat last
year. It seems that we imported, less exports, as
follows, viz.:?
Bushels. Value.
Wheat . . 677,519 . �298,619
Tons.
Flour . . 11,738 . �286,348
Total wheat and flour . . �584,967
Upwards of a half-a-million sterling thus ap-
pears to have been sent out of the country for
bread last year, being at the rate of �l. 85 5 d
per head for every man, woman, and child in the
country.
Against this importation we have a large set-off
in our export of maize, for I find that, deducting
imports, we shipped off 1,108,782 bushels of maize,
of the estimated value of �202,325.
In this valuable cereal therefore we seem to


possess an article of production capable of increase
to any extent, and one in the growth of which no
other colony can compete with us. The cultiva-
tion of maize in the last four years shows an
average of 96,676 acres yearly against 53,614
acres for the previous quadrennial period. The
average produce is found to vary very little (about
83 bushels per acre I think), and looking to the
comparative certainty of the yield as compared
with wheat, and to the nutritious properties of the
grain itself, it is somewhat surprising that it has
not found its way more largely into the manu-
facture of bread.
It is not my purpose to enter into an analysis of
the agricultural statistics generally, the subject
would require a paper to itself. Owing to the un-
satisfactory mode of collection, the returns do not
carry that weight with them which statistics of so
much interest ought to do.
It would be difficult, if not impossible, to arrive
at even an approximate estimate of the value of
our agricultural productions as a whole. They
are not like wool, mutton, and gold, brought to one
fixed and certain market, nor is their value to be
determined by the mere balance of exports over
imports. The true value is to be found in the
settlement of an industrious, persevering, and
moral peasantry upon the soil.
Including maize, hay, green fruits, butter and
cheese, potatoes, tobacco, and colonial wine, it does


not appear that our report of agricultural produce
(over and above imports), reached much over a
quarter of a million sterling in value last year.
What way have we the value of our home con-
sumption of these things it is almost impos-
sible to arrive at. If we combine the staple
produce of the agricultural and pastoral interests,
namely, that which goes to form the food and sus-
tenance of the people, and deducting importations
from exportations, we arrive at the following satis-
factory results, namely: that we more than
compensate for our deficient production of wheat
by our over production of sheep and cattle, that is
to say, whereas we import wheat and flour over
and above what we export, to the value of
�585,000, we export over and above what we im-
port of beef and mutton, to the value of �785,000.
It is thus you see that we balance accounts, and
find ourselves the gainers by the handsome surplus
of �200,000. This is the way to look at the matter,
and this is the reason that our purchase of bread
stuffs do not impoverish us, seeing that they are
more than returned to us by the sales of surplus
live stock.
MINING.
GOLD.
It seems from the Mint Returns that we received
from our own gold-fields last year 300,277 oz., of
the value of �1,158,215. The Miners? Rights


issued during the year were 15,458. Assuming
that the yields of gold are equally divided
amongst the diggers, they would have received an
average wage of �75 per man. Upon our gold-
fields then there would seem to be ample room for
the ? unemployed ?at remunerative wages, and
there are reasonable grounds for expecting that the
new discovery at the Weddin Mountains will en-
courage emigration from the overcrowded centres of
population, and add largely to the wealth of the
country, as well as to the prosperity of the mining
interest.
In the three years 1860 to 1862 our miners pro-
duced an annual average value of �1,737,393 of
gold, while in the three years 1863 to 1866 the
annual productions averaged �1,295,177 only.
The Chinese Registration Act came in operation in
1862, and from that year the gold returns have
gradually dwindled. The yield of gold dropped
from 587,895 ounces, of the value of �2,262,471
in 1862 to 401,713 oz. of the value of �1,545,419
in 1863. This must be regarded as the price we
paid to secure peace on our gold-fields and satisfy
the aversion of the Europeans to rub shoulders
with John Chinaman.
COAL.
Our coal mining interest has received a great
impetus during the last few years, although the
proprietors tell us it has been at a great sacrifice


of profits. A complaint borne out, I believe, by
the absence, of dividends in some instances, and a
visit to the Insolvent Court, in one or two
others. Yet unproductive to individuals as the in-
dustry may have proved, the country generally has
largely benefited by the increased production.
I find that whilst in 1855 our coal mines num-
bered only fourteen, producing 137,076 tons of
coal, of the value of �89,082, in 1865, they had
increased to twenty-four, producing 585,525 tons
of coal, of the value of �274,303, exhibiting an in-
crease of 326* per cent in the quantity, and 208*
per cent in the value.
Looking to the exports of the ten years, I find
that the annual average of the first four years was
�103,527 ; and of the second five years, �210,643,
or more than double.
3. Manufactures.
Our manufactures are comparatively limited.
They extend to woollen cloth, soap and candles,
tobacco, refined sugar, spirits, and kerosene oil?
the last being quite a new production. There is
nothing in the returns indicating any very notice-
able progress in this branch of industry, which is
kept down by the overwhelming competition from
abroad.
The price of skilled labour rules too high to
afford any very remunerative prospect for the em-
ployment of capital in manufacturing enterprise


in this colony under existing circumstances, and
the general feeling of the community in opposition
to a protective tariff renders the growth of manu-
facturing industry amongst us both slow and
precarious. People are not disposed to submit ??
as they think they would have to do?to an in-
crease of 100 per cent to the cost of living 5 they
do not see the use of bartering the fruits of their
hard-earned labour for boots and clothing, or
other necessities of life, at an artificially enhanced
price, when the markets of the world are open to
them. If we look to the results of our labours, we
shall find that whilst in the articles of boots, shoes,
and clothing we are undersold by the importers,
we are yet making headway against this competi-
tion, and that in the matter of carriage-making,
rough furniture, and boat-building, we are success-
fully competing with the mother country and
America; and in the matter of boots, I know from
experience that in the bush great preference is
given to those of colonial manufacture. Why,
therefore, attempt to bolster up by artificial means
interests which will more surely, if more slowly,
make their way in the ordinary course of events ?
4. Trade and Commerce.
Let us see now what evidence of depression we
can gather from these returns.
I shall take a wider range here because the
facts are not affected by the curtailment of our


territorial limits, and because I wish to compare
the extent of our trading during the last five years
with that of the previous five years, when the
colony was in the heyday of its wealth and pros-
perity.
I will begin with the year 1855, when I find the
value of our imports put down at �4,668,519, or
at the rate of �l6. 16s 4 d per head of the popu-
lation; whilst our exports amounted to �2,884,130,
or at the rate of �lO. 7s 9 d per head.
In 1860, I find the value of our imports put
down at �9,928,595, or at the rate of �24. 2s Set
per head of the population, and the exports at
�8,191,170, or at the rate of �l9.l7s9dper head.
Thus it appears that our imports were greater in
1865 by no less than �7. 6s 4d per head of the
population than they were in 1855, and our ex-
ports were greater by �9. 10s per head.
Now, I ask what evidence of depression do these
figures convey ? When we are absolutely import-
ing to a greater amount by �7. 6s 4 d per head,
and exporting to a greater amount by �9. 10s
than we were at the height of the gold mania.
Our imports being more than doubled, and our
exports nearly trebled in value, I want to know
where are the signs of decay and inactivity?
Well, but people may say that last year was a year
of overtrading?an exceptional year; and I must
confess that, as a rule, it is not safe to pin one?s
faith to the results of single years, so I will take


the results of the decennial period, dividing them
into two equal portions, and compare them.
Well, I find that in the five years (1856 to 1860),
we imported to the value of �32,366,083, yielding
an annual average of �6,473,516. Whilst, in the
next five years (1861 to 1865), we imported to the
value of �43,810,413, yielding an annual average
of �8,762,082 ; being an increase of 35 per cent.
Our exports, on the other hand, for the first
five years amounted to �21,469,178, or an average
of �4,293,835 annually; and for the second five
years, �35,942,627, or an annual average of
�7,188,525, an increase of 67 per cent.
Now this is an important fact to which I wish
to direct your attention, namely, that the ratio of
increase of our exports has nearly doubled that of
our imports. But as these figures represent the
total exports, it may be well to see the proportion
which the exports of our own produce and manu-
facture bear to the total.
It appears, then, that of the �5 7,41 1,805 of
exports in the ten years, �40,249,982 ?equal to
seventy per cent. ?were the products and manu-
factures of the colony. In the first five years the
annual average of our home-produced expoits
amounted to �3,083,828, and in the second five
years to �4,966,168, showing an increase of 61
per cent.
I ask, then, whether we can have more substan-
tial evidence of progress than these figures convey?


And where are the grounds for the tone of gloomy
despondency which pervades the utterances of the
unhappy croakers, who seem to enjoy every tale
of individual disaster which reaches their ears ?
There is one further feature in the statistics
before me which I should like to notice before I
conclude, as I think it presents a remarkable illus-
tration of the present wealth of the country, and
that is the large accumulation of deposits in em-
banking institutions.
5. Accumulation.
The deposits in the Banks at the end of 1865
amounted to �5,827,098, and in the Savings? Bank
to �B4o,962?together �6,668,060, or at the rate
of �l6. 4s 2 d per head of the population.
Here we have upwards of six millions and a
half of money lying in the banks unused by the
depositors, and still accumulating?for the Bank
returns for the last quarter show a still further
accumulation to the extent of another half-million,
whilst at the same time we hear an universal
outcry of the want of money, and the labouring
population calling out for employment. Here is a
paradox, yet it is one which a little reflection will
enable us to solve. Restore immigration, says
one; tax absentees, says another; push your pub-
lic works, says a third. Protect native industry,
says a fourth. The banks are at the bottom of it
all. Start a National Bank, says a fifth, and so
on. Each has his nostrum. Well, we have had


no reason to complain of tlie overflow of popu-
lation to our shores, for it has been seen that, on
the average of the last six years, the immigration
has only reached 3305 yearly, or under 20,000 in
all, and that largely made up of women. And we
have seen that, without rubbing shoulders more
closely than we do in the metropolitan county, we
have room for more than forty times our present
inhabitants.
Of course the stoppage of immigration has
reduced the demand for houses, and therefore the
building-trade is depressed. Stonemasons, brick-
layers, and carpenters are only getting 7s to 10s a
day where they were getting 15s to 20s in the
gold times, and still because rents have come
down, the' capitalist will tell you that he can?t
afford to build houses, that he gets a better return
for his money by placing it on deposit in the
banks, than he can by employing it in building.
The seasons have discouraged the flow of capital
to the soil. The farmer has been impoverished,
and the labourer has suffered with him, whilst our
mechanics and tradesmen complain of the evil
effects of foreign competition upon their occupations
and wages.
It must not be forgotten, however, that whilst
wages succumb to the depression, the cost of
house rent and the prices of every article of con-
sumption, every necessary of life, have found at
least a corresponding reduction, and that 306* a


week now will give the labouring man more com-
forts than he could have obtained at double those
wages in the gold times.
It is contrary to the nature of things that wages
should keep up when everything else has declined.
The capitalist won?t undertake any enterprise by
which he must lose. Interests so intimately inter-
twined as capital and labour, and depending inter-
changeably upon each other, will always correct
and adjust themselves, and it is as unreasonable
for the labouring man to look for exemption from
the general depression as it would be to look to
escape from the general lot of humanity. It is to
expect to get blood out of a stone, that wages are
to be paid which no returns will produce. The
sooner, therefore, we look the altered state of
things in the face, and adjust our views and
demands to them, the sooner shall we emerge from
our difficulties, and start afresh with a new life
and new energy to the opening up of new pursuits,
and to the further development of our well-tried
resources.
I need not pursue this subject further. The
paper is already longer than I anticipated, but the
subject is a wide one, and has of necessity been
discursively treated. I think I have abundantly
shown, not only the stability, but progress of our
great industrial resources. I have adduced evi-
dence of the development and activity of our
commerce, and of the amassed wealth which as a


community we enjoy. The depression of which I
have spoken cannot live long where such sources
of wealth abound. Indeed, I think there are
already such palpable evidences of reviving pios-
perity as to justify the prediction that the year
1867 will prove one of the most prosperous in our
annals.
Times of depression, if properly improved, are
of the greatest value to a community such as ours.
They incite us to plan and strive to open up new
channels of industry and new roads to wealth.
They are useful as soberisers to bring us down
from the intoxicating influence of the golden era
to the plodding, persevering, honest industry
which, after all, as being most conducive to the
growth of provident and moral habits, is more
certain as well to augment the future happiness of
the people, as to promote the permanent progress
and well-being of the country.
THE END.
