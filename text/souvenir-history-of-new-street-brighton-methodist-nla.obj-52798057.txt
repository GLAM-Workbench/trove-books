Fore word
It is with a sense of awe that we peruse a record such as this, for it is
not merely the story of any hundred years of Christian life and worship.
Like the Book of Genesis, which describes the making of an ordered universe
from nothing, so this little brochure is a record of the life of men who started
in the emptiness of a primeval solitude and, walking with God in the silence,
strove to build up from nothing a society of men that would be truly Christian.
A touch of quaintness clings to many of their ways and sayings, but what
indomitable men they were, and what heroic women! What Christians!
What Methodists! We, of this later date, who enjoy the comforts and facilities
of modern life, and have artistic appurtenances of worship, might well beseech
the Almighty God to baptize us into the spirit of our ancestors. May the life
of this church, which began with the Book of Genesis, go on through many a
rich chapter of psalmody, and prophecy and evangelical fervour towards the
Revelation of Christ in the Holy City of God!

Early Victorian Methodism
One hundred years ago Methodism in Australia was not very strong.
In the minutes of the British Methodist Conference held at Newcastle-on-Tyne
on 28th July, 1840, under the heading of Foreign Missions, appears the
following:—"Australian District: New South Wales Melbourne, (Australia
Felix), one minister to be sent by the General Superintendent in consultation
with the Chairman of the Australian and Van Diemen's Land District." At
that time the only other appointments in what is now Victoria were Benjamin
Hurst and Francis Tuckfield to Buntingdale, a Mission to the Aborigines, a
short distance from Geelong.
The first reference of any kind to Brighton demonstrates how scanty and
unreliable was the information available to the British Conference. At the
Conference opened on 27th July, 1853, at Bradford, we find the surprising
statement: "Brighton Gold Fields, William S. Byrnes, who shall act under
the direction of the Melbourne Superintendent."
The beginnings of Methodism in Victoria were of a very humble nature.
Henry Reed, then a zealous local preacher in Tasmania, having the welfare
of the native population in view, came over to Port Phillip in 1835 with one
of the earliest bands of settlers, and conducted the first Christian service in
the little settlement. The congregation included William Buckley, the escaped
convict, who, as most readers of Colonial history know, had been living in a
state of wildness and barbarism with the natives for over thirty years; the
brother of Mr. John Batman (who afterwards became the chief constable of
the settlement); and three natives from Sydney, who but imperfectly understood
the English language. Such was the beginning of Methodist work in Victoria.
A similar motive to Christianize the natives and preserve them from any
demoralizing influences that might be brought by the colonists prompted
the visit to Melbourne of the Rev. Joseph Orton, in the following year. His
voyage across Bass Strait was a prolonged and unpleasant one in a small
craft, and after ten days of rough weather, during which he was extremely
seasick, the boat sailed up the River Yarra on April 20th, 1836.
On the following Sunday, April 24th, 1836, he preached his first sermons
on Batman's Hill to congregations which consisted largely of natives. His
visit, however, was but a short one, and he returned to Tasmania, paying
another rather longer visit in 1839, when he recorded in his journal that "The
Methodist Society has swelled to thirty members."
On Saturday, October 3rd, 1840, he again arrived in Melbourne to take
charge in a temporary capacity of the Melbourne Church. He was largely
responsible for the establishment of the Methodist organization; the first
Quarterly Meeting was held at his home on the 28th January, 1841. He finally
left Melbourne for England on March 2nd, 1842, but died at sea on April 30th,
1842.
During his stay in the Melbourne District, services were established at
Brighton, Brunswick, Williamstown, and New Town, later named Collingwood.


Th e Chur ch at Brighton
The beginnings of Brighton are closely associated with the name of Henry
Dendy, who arrived in Port Phillip by the ship "York," on sth February, 1841.
He immediately presented to the Superintendent of the District, Mr. C. J.
Latrobe, his famous Order from the Colonial Land and Emigration Office
in London, entitling him to select eight square miles of land, for which he
had paid £1 per acre.
After meeting with some official obstruction, he ultimately selected the
area which now comprises practically the whole of the City of Brighton.
Dendy's Special Survey, as it is well known, extended from what is now
North Road, a distance of two miles to South Road, and from the foreshore
four miles inland to Boundary Road as its eastern limit. The estate was
originally named Waterville, but this was soon changed to Brighton.
Blamires and Smith, in their "Early Story of the Wesleyan Methodist
Church in Victoria," give the following description of Brighton in the early
'forties:—
"Brighton was then a scattered hamlet on the opposite side of the bay
FIRST MEETING PLACE.
(from Williamstown) and communication between Sandridge and Williarnstown
was for a while effected by a whaleboat, which set out in answer to a
signal smoke raised on shore; or else by trudging round on foot and crossing
the Saltwater and Yarra in punts. Mr. Charles Stone, then in his youthful
prime, tells how, with his coat on his arm, and subdued with the sun's fervent
heat, he has had to pick his way through the bush which lay between the
Yarra and Brighton. There was only one Circuit horse for the Colony, and
many competitors for that, Mr. Witton's celebrated 'pony' being reserved
for a few personal friends."
Henry Dendy was a religious man, and chose as pioneers men of
approved character, some of whom were connected with the first Wesleyan
Churches in Melbourne in Swanston Street, and later in Collins Street.
Mr. Dendy held a Sunday evening service in his temporary home in New
Street, after the manner of the Church of England. The Wesleyans preferred
in their accustomed manner to meet for prayer and testimony, and Mr. T.
Walton offered the use of his two-roomed cottage for that purpose (the north


west corner of New and Bay Streets), whence came the first inspiration for
the glorious times that followed. Mr, Walton was one of the members of the
first class-meeting held in Melbourne, and his homely cottage at Brighton was
dedicated to the worship of God by many a hearty prayer and faithful
sermon from local preachers who "missioned" the place. The little room
was often crowded, and the congregation sometimes diverted by sundry
cooking and domestic operations which were carried on behind the preacher's
back. In after years Mr. Walton was a familiar figure at all our services,
and was regarded as a sort of curiosity, famous for the peculiar style of his
public prayers, and other eccentric habits. He died about 1873, leaving
his cottage and allotment of land to the Wesleyan Church.
It early became necessary to find a larger meeting place, and Joseph
James, who had built a more commodious house on the opposite side of the
street (the north-east corner), gladly welcomed this band of earnest Christian
men and women. A class and cottage prayer meeting was held at the
heme of Mrs. Battrick, who had removed to the north-west corner of Bay
and Asling Streets. It is related of Mr. and Mrs. Battrick, that with three
other young couples who came with them, they constructed on the beach a
large four-fold slab house, covered with branches and bushes, whereof each
family had one corner. It was anything but waterproof, and in stormy
weather, though their corner was next the fireplace, Mrs. Battrick and her
babe were often drenched.
After a public and private sale of land in Brighton, the population
materially increased, and in 1845 it was found necessary to build a chapel.
A site at the corner of New and Allee Streets and Outer Crescent was
acquired.
A Deed of Conveyance of this land was executed on 15th April, 1846,
and was signed by the following as Trustees, all of whom were members of
the Melbourne Quarterly Meeting:—
Rev, Edward Sweetman (Superintendent). William Hunter.
Joseph Robert Burns. Walter Powell.
John Randal Pascoe. William Willoughby.
Robert Gallagher. Leonard Edwards.
Thomas Wellard. Peter Dredge.
James Webb. John Mills.
The description of the land is as follows:
"All that piece or parcel of land containing two acres of the Brighton
Estate situate in the Parish of Moorabbin and County of Bourke being a
portion West Town boundary between New Road and Lower Crescent Road
on the plan of the subdivision of the said Estate commencing at a point twelve
chains and seventy-five links south from High Street (now Barkly Street)
bounded on the West by New Road, bearing South two chains and twenty-five
links on the South by Church Place (now Allee Street) by a line bearing South-
easterly five chains and twenty-seven links on the East by Lower Crescent
Road, Northerly in a concave line four chains and seventy-five links a little
more or less on the north by a line bearing west to the commencing point
six chains and ten links."
In the Deed of Conveyance, although the transfer was described as a
gift, the payment of £2/2/- as the consideration is recorded.
The form of transfer was the particular form of conveyance used in


connection with the Dendy Special Survey. The document measures 26" x
15", and is closely printed on both sides.
It is now kept in the Methodist Conference Office, Melbourne.
The problem of building the Chapel was the first difficulty, as no timber
was available, but it was solved by the offer of Mr. Wm. German to cart the
stone from the beach, and the building was commenced and completed by
voluntary labour.
Portion of the site was reserved as a cemetery, and burials took place,
but ceased shortly after the Brighton Cemetery was opened in 1854.
The present Church—in 1859. In the left background stands the original Chapel,
then part of the parsonage.
The earliest statistical evidence of the Brighton cause is contained in the
official Returns of Membership of the Melbourne Society for the quarter
ended 31st March, 1843, as follows; —
Great Brighton. Little Brighton.
Full Members 2 1
Members on Trial 4 __ 7
Total __ 6 8
Increase __ 6 8
The records show that these members were meeting in class on Sunday
afternoon under the leadership of local preachers.
It will very readily be granted that in all probability devout members
were meeting in private homes before they were officially recognized and
included in the records of the Melbourne Society.
This evidence also supports the statement that almost simultaneously
with the meetings at Great Brighton a similar work at Little Brighton had
been undertaken in Union Street under the leadership of Chas. Stone, Wm.
Head, and George Thomas. The first meetings were held at the early
home of Mr. Thomas, a small slab house covered with thatch. Little Brighton,
earlier named Union Village, seems to have been the name given to the
eastern portion of Brighton, and the Church there afterward came to be
known as Mill Street, and now as Hawthorn Road, Brighton.
The work at Brighton continued as part of the Melbourne Pastorate until
1852, when it became the separate Brighton Circuit.


It is interesting to quote here the original entry in the Minute Book of the
Melbourne District Meeting that marked the official recognition of Brighton's
claim to the status of a Circuit.
The meeting, held in Collins Street on September 9th, 1851, was attended
by Messrs. W. Butters, Lightbody, Lewis, Harcourt, and Waterhouse, and the
minute reads as follows;
"We feel it imperative to act upon the earnest recommendation of the
Melbourne Quarterly Meeting to place a minister at Brighton. There is a
population of 2000 persons. We have 60 members of society. Our three
chapels are filled with attentive congregations, and the friends there have
pledged themselves to increase their annual contributions from £3O to £lOO
on condition that a minister reside among them. The minister residing at
Brighton will be able to visit St. Kilda, Prahran, Gardiner's Creek, Dandenong,
and other places, and can change regularly with the ministers at Melbourne
and Collingwood."
OUR MINISTERS.
The first resident minister was Rev. W. Byrnes, a probationer, who resided
in a cottage in Allee Street opposite the Church, pending the provision of a
parsonage. He was succeeded by Rev. Edward Sweetman in 1853, and the
building of a new Church was undertaken. To provide a minister's residence,
the old chapel was remodelled, and a weatherboard extension added in which
to carry on the services during the building of the new Church.
In the minutes of the Meeting of the Victoria District held at Melbourne
on 19th January, 1854, there appears the following:—Brighton: Two acres
on which are a Stone Chapel and Mission House. A large beautiful Chapel
has been commenced: no debt.
At the next Annual Meeting, held on 18th January, 1855, it was reported
that "a handsome Brick Chapel, 58 feet by 42, has been erected during the
past year; will accommodate 400 persons. Cost, £2000."
Rev. Jas. Bickford, a returned missionary from the West Indies, was
appointed Superintendent in 1854, and the new Church, which is the present
structure, was dedicated on 24th December, 1854, and was known as
Ebenezer Church. The officiating clergymen were Revs. Wm. Butters, J. Eggle-
ston, J. S. Waugh, and J. Bickford. A tea meeting held about the time realised
£l2O, whilst a bazaar was also very successful. The principal stall-holders,
Mrs. Jas. Webb and Mrs. Battrick, raised £l5O and £l6O respectively.
The porch to the Church was not added until 1858.
Mr. and Mrs. Bickford were farewelled on 6th March, 1857. They were
presented with a purse of 50 sovereigns in acknowledgment of their earnest
and useful service.
Rev. Edward King then took charge, and by his kindly unassuming
disposition he won the love of all.
The Rev. Thos. Williams, a Missionary from Fiji, followed. He brought
with him a large and useful family. His son, John, was a local preacher,
and Thomas (or Tom) made a good secretary of the Sunday School. The
congregations were at their best at this time, and held well together during
the superintendency of Rev. Geo. Daniel. During the 'sixties good results
came from the visits of "California" Taylor and Matthew Burnett. When
the Rev. Chas. Lane took charge, the Church was well attended, and his
short, pithy, and earnest addresses were most effective.


The Rev. James Watkin, another returned Missionary, was the Minister
in 1868, and the Rev. J. B. Smith in 1869; and these two excellent men success-
fully carried on the work done by their predecessors.
On June 29th, 1871, the Circuit granted £2/12/- to Rev. J. B. Smith "to
meet the loss sustained by him in the sale of horse for the work of the
Circuit. This must not be regarded as a precedent."
Then followed Revs. W. L. Blamires (1872-75), J. Catterall (1875-78), and
C. Lancaster (1878-81).
At the Quarterly Meeting on 28th June, 1876, Rev. J. Catterall was
instructed to forward to the St. Kilda Circuit a letter respecting the transfer
of Oakleigh and Mulgrave to that Circuit.
On 12th January, 1877, after much discussion, it was decided "that we
have the Church lit with gas." During the ministry of Rev. Ralph Brown
(1881-84), the Church was beautified and modernized, new windows of
cathedral glass being installed at a cost of £9O. A new parsonage was also
built in this period.
In 1883, Mr. Carey of Little Brighton died, leaving a legacy of £2258/10/7
to the several chapels in the Brighton Circuit. The amount was divided by his
executors among the several Trusts, Brighton (New Street) receiving £SOO,
and Little Brighton £7OO/10/7.
Rev. W. P. Wells came in 1884, and during his ministry the question of
additional accommodation became pressing. Alterations and additions were
made to the Sunday School, including the chimney in the kitchen.
In the next five years three changes took place, Revs. John Watsford
(1887-89), C. H. Ingamells (1889-91), and A. Rigg (1891-92) coming and going.
The next appointment was Rev. Thos. Adamson (1892-95). His term saw the
enlargement of the Church, and the erection of the present School Hall.
The Trust Minute Book records many discussions over the previous
eighteen months, and the consideration of several alternate plans.
The work involved the lengthening of the Church by 25 feet. At the
same time the new pipe organ was installed in its present position. It
may be noted here that the old organ occupied a position at the other end
of the Church.
Including the new School, the total expenditure was £774/15/6.
During the ministries of Revs. H. E. Merriman (1895-98) and R. W. Thompson
(1898-1901), the minutes suggest considerable financial pressure, finally result-
ing in the Trust mortgaging the property for £ISOO to private lenders, at
3i% p.a. for ten years.
From 1901 to 1904, Rev. H. Saloway was the Superintendent at New
Street, and he was succeeded by Rev. S. Scholes (1904-07), and Rev. Percy
Knight (1907-10). The financial strain was responsible in 1909 for the sale
of the block of land on the north-east corner. On 9th December, 1909, Mr.
Samuel Taylor was appointed caretaker, and his efficient service and
picturesque figure are still kindly remembered.
Rev. Wesley Johns was our pastor from 1910-1912. Just before the close
of his ministry, the Church received the handsome bequest from the late
William Harbison, to which extended reference has been made elsewhere.
Shortly afterwards, Rev. S. Adamson was appointed (1912-15), and then


came Rev. W. Vawdon (1915-19), his ministry covering most of the Great War.
Mr. Vawdon freely exercised his artistic gifts, and was responsible for the
design of the War Memorial stained glass window. The Church grounds
were also reorganized under his inspiration.
The next Superintendent, Rev. Alfred Madsen, is the only minister to have
occupied the position for the maximum term of five years (1919-24). His special
ministry to aged and invalid members was greatly appreciated. He gave
place to Rev. W. H. Hodge (1924-27).
During his stay, a very successful Fair was held, which realized £336.
Electric light was installed throughout the Church and School. The old method
of hand blowing of the pipe organ was replaced by a small electric motor
and blower, and the organ was thoroughly renovated.
Dr. C. W. ATKINSON, M.A., Litt.D.
His successor was Rev. A. P. Bladen, 0.8. E. (1927-30), who was followed
by Rev. S. Churchward (1930-33), to be succeeded in turn by Rev. H. S. Heath,
who remained for two years (1933-35). In 1935 Conference sent us Rev. W. J.
Williams, who, splendidly assisted by his devoted wife and their family,
spent four strenuous years (1935-39), until his appointment to Sandringham.
In 1936 an electric heating system was installed in the Church, greatly
adding to its comfort during the colder months. The cost of £l2O was readily
collected by one of the trustees.
Our present minister is Rev. C. W. Atkinson, M.A., Litt.D., an ex-President
and distinguished member of our Conference for many years
The long line of ministers of Christ who have served Him at New Street
constitutes a band of earnest and gifted men, and even to read their names


will bring to the thoughtful mind the immense amount of service, devotion and
self-sacrifice that have been given to the Church in this place over the
100 years.
An attractive and unusual, if not unique, feature of which we are proud,
is the "gallery" of photos, of all the ministers, excepting the first (Rev. W.
Byrnes), who have been stationed at New Street since the inception of the
Brighton Circuit in 1852. This "gallery" is hung in the minister's vestry, and
always evokes the interest of visitors. We are exceedingly pleased to have
been able to reproduce these photos, in this souvenir.
Although not stationed at New Street, Father (Rev. W. A.) Quick, who
performed such magnificent work for Queen's College, lived in this Circuit
for over 40 years. A supernumerary for 31 years, he was an outstanding
figure. His holy influence and service, and- that of his daughters, Mrs. Crookes
and Miss Margaret Quick, are gratefully remembered by many of our older
folk.
Over the years many names appear in the records of the Church and
Circuit, but it has been deemed inadvisable to attempt to compile a complete
list of all the officers, even if that had been possible.
Amongst the early pioneers of Methodism in Great Brighton, the names
of Mrs. Battrick (1841), Mr. Thos. Ricketts (1845), Mr. William German (1846),
Mr. and Mrs. Jas. Webb (1849), and Mr. William Harbison are prominent,
whilst later references contain frequent mention of such men as Thos. Wellard,
Henry Baker, J. Gifford, J. W. Ruddle, John Baker, Gideon Baker, Mark Hollow.
It is perhaps a little surprising to reflect that these names have dis-
appeared from the membership of our Church, although Mrs. Clark, the widow
of the late William Clark, who was a trustee in the 'eighties, is the daughter
of Mr. John Baker, and is still a devoted member. She was a faithful worker
in the Church and Sunday School in her earlier years, and we believe has
the longest association of present members with New Street. We express
our kindest remembrances of her worth and work.
We also remember with pleasure that various members of the family
of Mr. John Gifford are still with us, even to the third generation.
REVIVALS.
The Circuit has been blessed with gracious revivals, among which may
be mentioned one as early as 1847, and the Great Revival under the ministry
of the Rev. Edward King. The visits of Matthew Burnet and Rev. Wm. (Cali-
fornia) Taylor were also attended with much blessing. The work of the
Rev. Geo. Daniel was also greatly honoured at the Clyde and in other
parts of the Circuit.
LOCAL PREACHERS.
No history of Methodism can be complete without reference to the work
of our local preachers; indeed, there would be no history at all in many
cases if they had not pioneered and established the cause in these places.
The first years of Brighton are largely a story of the service and zeal
of laymen, whose names figure prominently in these pages, and several of
whom, although not ordained, were really pastors to the people.
Established by John Wesley himself the system is an integral part of our
Church management, and has produced a glorious company of unselfish and

self-sacrificing men whose devoted services through the years are beyond
valuation.
Again it would be impossible to mention all the names, although many
occur in other connections in these pages. Suffice it to say that we owe them
a great debt which cannot be repaid, and which we gratefully acknowledge.
We may be thankful that this arm of cur ministry still abides in strength.
The Brighton Circuit is exceedingly rich in its band of active local preachers,
whose services are not only freely given to our own Circuit, but are constantly
and regularly sought by adjacent Circuits for many miles around. New
Street Church has a goodly company whom we are delighted to honour, and
whose names we record with proud appreciation:—Messrs. W. J. Williamson,
A. Scott, G. A. Giles, L. Roberts, A. T. Latham, F. S. Head, and
W. Russell.
CLASS LEADERS.
Although little more than a matter of history to the present generation,
and a memory to some of the older members, Class Leaders shared with
Local Preachers the distinguishing glories of the Methodist Church. It is a
common sorrow that their race has left no descendants, the system gradually
falling into disuse in the early years of this century.
It was the practice to include every member in one of the classes, in
charge of a Class Leader, meeting regularly each week and giving oppor-
tunity for personal testimony and mutual help.
A register of classes at New Street from 1864 to 1885 includes the names
of a number of leaders, but the noteworthy item is that Mr. John Baker
was a Class Leader for the whole of that time. He died on 29th March, 1891.
Other references make mention at various times of other class leaders, but
they are largely a repetition of the names, recorded elsewhere, of men who
obviously were active in every good work.
OUR TRUSTEES.
Information available gives the names of the Trustees of the New Street
Church at certain periods. The names of the original Trustees, eleven in
all, are preserved in the Conveyance of the 2 acres from Henry Dendy
already mentioned.
In 1864 we find the following:—J. Randal Pascoe, Robert Gallagher, Thos.
Wellard, James Webb, Walter Powell, Thos. Ricketts, Peter Dredge, Charles
Stone, John Gifford, William German, Mark Hollow, and James W. Ruddle.
By 1884 numerous changes had taken place and the list now comprised:—
William German, Charles Stone, James German, James W. Ruddle, John Adie
Hicks, William Henry Parr, Joseph Knowles, Gideon Baker, William Clark
and John Hudson Marsden.
Since that date the following appointments have been made: —J. Jamison,
J. Falkingham, W. Hill, J. Campbell, P. Oakden, G. Spicer, W. J. Williamson,
(ex M.L.C.), G. B. Leith, F. Gibbs, J. C. Wright, F. H. Hinrichsen, J. Robinson,
T. Tucker, W. Moulton, A. Leake, S. E. Watkin, A. Scott, A. H. Guthridge,
W. Woodhead, W. H. Cripps, G. A. Giles, F. T. Meyers, T. A. Miller,
A. E. Paterson, W. A. Mewton, W. M. Chellew, H. E. Bruns, C. Swain,
W. F. Cock, W. J. Williamson, H. R. Armour, A. T. Latham, L. Roberts,
F. E. Sides, F. C. Sides.


MINISTERS FROM 1891 TILL 1935.
17, A. Rigg, 1891; 18, T. Adamson, 1892; 18, H. E. Merriman, 1892; 20, R. W. Thompson,

Williams, 1935.


Many of these are still active in the counsels and work of the Church
and even while they are still with us, we would pay appropriate tribute to
their loyalty and devotion to the Master and to His Church in this place.
Particular mention should be made of the debt of gratitude that we owe
to Mr. Thos. Tucker, who for many years devoted himself with loving thought
and service to the care of the property which has been kept in excellent
condition.
An interesting minute appears under date of 27th September, 1902 to the
effect that Mr. Tucker be asked to collect for the Anniversary Tea Meeting—
and what a splendid collector he has been!
DEVELOPMENT.
With increasing settlement the Churches grew. The membership of the
Circuit increased from 69 in 1853 to 175 in 1858, 217 in 1863, and 344 in 1865.
The figures for New Street were 32 in 1854, 39 in 1855, and by 1865 had reached
56. They fell to 37 in 1869 and to 28 in 1873, but recovered to 57 in 1883,
and 72 in 1885. The present membership of New Street is 134, and of the
Brighton Circuit 579.
The development of the work throughout the Circuit may be seen from
the number of Circuits that have grown from within the boundaries of the
Brighton Circuit. The original area now includes the following Circuits —21
in all; South Melbourne, Port Melbourne, Elsternwick-St. Kilda, Albert Park,
Prahran, Toorak, Malvern, Malvern South, Caulfield, Brighton, Sandringham,
Moorabbin, Bentleigh, Mordialloc, Cheltenham and Mentone, Oakleigh,
Frankston, Mornington, Dromana, Springvale, Dandenong. They include 86
Churches and seven other preaching places. There are 35 parsonages and
84 Sunday Schools with 8573 scholars. The total membership is 7249, in
the charge of 57 ministers and probationers, assisted by 250 local preachers.
An instance of the missionary zeal of those earlier days is a minute
of the Circuit Quarterly Meeting to the effect that a movement be made "to
visit the outlying villages of Prahran and St. Kilda and supply them with the
ordinances of religion."
MUSIC.
No record would be complete without reference to the work of the
Choir. A minute of a Trustee Meeting held on 7th December, 1858, covers
a resolution that an invitation be extended to Rev. D. J. Draper and Hon.
J. Pascoe Fawkner to conduct the Anniversary Services, and "that the Choir
be invited to assist."
Prior to 1876, Mr. Jas. Webb had loaned an organ for the services, but in
that year the Church bought an organ for £lBO. This instrument was taken
over as part payment when the present pipe organ was installed in 1893 at
an additional cost of £3OO.
The records available are, unfortunately, very deficient in regard to the
names of those who in the past have been responsible for the most important
and often arduous duties of Conductor and Organist. Any references, there-
fore, to individuals may and probably will omit tribute to several of these,
but lack of the knowledge of their names is the only reason. Their work has
not been overlooked, but on the contrary is highly esteemed.


One of the earliest references that has been found is a minute of a
Trustee Meeting held on 14th July, 1884, to the effect that Mr. J. W. Ruddle had
resigned as Choir Leader.
Other leaders and organists of the Choir that either records or memory
have recalled include: Messrs. Gideon Baker, Wm. Pattinson, Joseph Wellard,
F. Ruddle, P. Oakden, W. Moulton, E. Oyston, J. B. Brogden, Percy Derrick,
J. Godfrey, T. A. Miller, and E. Rayment, Misses Gifford (2), A. Hicks, R.
Saloway, E. M. Robinson, and E. Plant.
In several cases the offices of conductor and organist were combined,
the last to hold the dual office being Mr. E. Rayment, who took charge in 1907.
Although he continued as organist until 1922, he relinquished the position
of conductor in 1915 in favour of Mr. C. Swain, who held the position for
20 years. For his devotion during the whole of that time, and for the excellent
service rendered by the Choir under his leadership, the Church is deeply
indebted and is glad of this opportunity of expressing its appreciation.
Mr. John Robinson, one of our earliest members and connected with the
Choir for many years, was then appointed conductor, and, with Mrs. T.
George as organist, the choral portion of our services fully upholds the
splendid traditions of our Church Choir.
OUR LADIES.
The Church as a whole cannot estimate the value of the work which its
women have done throughout the years, and still continue to do. We do
however acknowledge with sincere and heartfelt gratitude the constant and
self-sacrificing labour of love which the women of Methodism in general,
and of New Street in particular, contribute to the service of the Master. Very
little of it is spectacular, but year in and year out Martha's successors carry
on.
In this connection we have several active ladies' organizations.
The Women's Auxiliary of Overseas Missions was formed at a meeting
held on July I.9th, 1898, as an Auxiliary of the Brighton Circuit.
Some time later, the Auxiliaries became activities of the local Churches,
and New Street Auxiliary for many years has been an extremely active and
valuable aid to missionary enthusiasm.
In addition to gifts in kind sent to the various mission stations, the
ladies contribute £4O per year to the funds of the Central Council of the
Auxiliary. Their monthly meetings are one of the strong posts of the Church.
Mrs. C. W. Atkinson is the President, Mrs. Giles the Secretary, and Mrs. Walker
the Treasurer.
The Babies' Home Maintenance Circle has been in existence since 1929,
when the Babies' Home at South Yarra was built. Meeting monthly, this
group of ladies has been responsible for the supply of hundreds of garments,
in addition to an annual contribution of £2O in cash, so that this Christlike
work for helpless babies might be continued. Mrs. W. F. Cock was the
enthusiastic Secretary for the first ten years. Mrs. C. W. Atkinson and
Mrs. R. Rowe are the present President and Secretary respectively, and
Miss Ladner is Treasurer.


The Ladies' Guild was established in 1936 with Mrs. W. I. Williams
as President and Mrs. C. Waller as Secretary. The Guild works primarily
for the benefit -of our own Church, and the Trustees are indebted to the
ladies for various furnishings as well as substantial cash donations. Mrs.
C. W. Atkinson is our present President, Mrs. Hurrey is Secretary, and Mrs.
Marrow is Treasurer.
In June, 1940, in response to the needs of these days, a branch of the
Red Cross Society came into being. Mrs. Atkinson accepted the office of
President. Mrs. C. Waller was the first Secretary, but owing to ill-health was
compelled to resign, and Mrs. G. A. Giles has taken her place. Mrs. H. E.
Bruns is the Treasurer. Affiliated with the local branch of the Society and the
Brighton Patriotic Society, the members have knitted and sewn hundreds of
garments, including sox, caps, pyjamas, scarves, etc. In addition, from
small weekly or monthly contributions from the members, the Treasurer has
collected to date the sum of £9O.
Deeply as we deplore the necessity, the Red Cross Society must continue
to minister to the needs of the sick and wounded, and invites the co-operation
of all. The Branch will welcome the membership of men as well as women.
If you are not already linked up with a branch of the Red Cross Society, will
you get into touch with one of the officers of our Church Branch?
OTHER ORGANIZATIONS.
From time to time various societies have been formed in connection
with the Church to meet some demand, and although some, after having
served their purpose in greater or less degree, have gradually declined,
others continue to render useful service.
For instance, we regret that just now we have no branch of the
Y.P.S.C.E., but we hope that it may be re-established shortly.
We have, however, a branch of the Women's Home Mission League,
with Mrs. Atkinson as President and Sister Lillie as Secretary. There is also
a branch of the Methodist Girls' Fellowship in connection with the Church,
of which Mrs. Giles is President and Miss Lorna Archbold is Secretary.
For some years, the Girls' Physical Culture Club has conducted regular
classes through the winter months, and has thus provided a means of
recreation and physical training, as well as a social contact for the girls.
Miss M. Hilton is the Secretary.
The Tennis Club, with its two courts in the Church grounds, is also a
centre of pleasant recreational and social activity. The Secretary is Mr.
Gordon Bruns.
Our Cricket Club, which has often been prominent in past years, continues
to provide a meeting-place and a means of recreation for our young men.
Mr. K. Brokenshire is the Secretary.
A Boys' Club was established some months ago, and meets in the School
Hall each Friday evening under the control of Mr. Gordon Bruns. The
attendance is small, but those in charge hope that it will grow.


THE GREAT WAR.
When war was declared in 1914, the young men of our Church responded
to- the call of Empire. Many volunteered for active service. The Honour Roll
in the Church and the Memorial Window dedicated to their memory contain
the following names: —
Clive Callaghan, Geo. Watson, Frederick Gibbs, William Storey, Ernest
Wearne, David Ruddle, Eric C. Stranger, Cecil Derrick. Granger Clarke, Eric
Clarke, F. W. Hinrichsen, Eric Ronald, Arthur E. Ruddle, Basil Albury,
William J. Lobb, Stanley Corben, J. Monk, Oliver Hull, Douglas Hull, Ernest
Bishop, Harold Ross, George Lowe, Claude Aldridge, Vernon Wood, J. Brockley,
Patrick Sheean, George Clark, Stanley David, Alfred E. Thompson, Percy
Millard, Edwin Clark, Albert Elsworth, Herbert Murrell, Herbert Bennett,
Stanley A. Morey, S. J. Atkinson, Frank Callaghan, Howard Miller, George
B. Leith, Hugh Armour, William Robinson, Clement R. Addis, Lance Vawdon.
The following made the supreme sacrifice: —
Frederick Gibbs, Ernest Wearne, Cecil Derrick, F. W. Hinrichsen, Stanley
Corben, Ernest Bishop, Harold Ross, Edwin Clark, Herbert Murrell, Herbert
Bennett, Stanley A. Morey, and Clement R. Addis.
"Greater love hath no man than this: that a man lay down his life
for his friends."
Now that the Empire has again become involved in defending the better
way of life and the rights of smaller nations, the young men of our families
associated with the Church are responding to the call to defend all we hold
dear. Many have enlisted, but it is not possible to supply a complete list
of all who are serving the Empire in this time of crisis'.
HARBISON BEQUEST.
A brass plate affixed to Pew No. 9 on the north side of the Church,
inscribed the "Harbison Pew," commemorates the life and work of Mr.
William Harbison, as well as his generosity. Mr. Harbison died in November,
1909, after an active and honoured association with New Street of over
50 years, and by his will provided for the extinction of the whole of the debt
on the Church property. His executors, Rev. A. R. Edgar and Mr. V. F. Mason,
applied for probate, but this was opposed by the next of kin. The Court
refused to grant probate, and an appeal was made to the High Court. While
the appeal was pending, negotiations for a compromise took place between
the applicants for probate and the Harbison family, and a settlement was
reached. The settlement contained certain conditions, amongst which was
an arrangement that certain bequests mentioned in the contested will,
including that to the Church, should be paid unconditionally.
Therefore, on 30th March, 1912, a cheque for £1379/16/6 was received
by letter from Mr. David Harbison, a brother of the testator. The letter
included this paragraph: "I take leave to express the hope that the Trustees
of this Church will not again saddle the congregation with any debt at any
time."
Obviously this was a most generous benefaction, and has relieved the
Church of much anxiety and the payment of considerable interest.


Sun day School
On the occasion of the Jubilee of the Sunday School in 1899, Rev. J. B.
Smith, at the request of the Officers and Teachers, compiled a brief history
of the First Fifty Years of the School. Rev. J. B. Smith, then a supernumerary
in the Circuit, was well qualified, as he had been stationed at New Street
in 1869, and in conjunction with Rev. W. L. Blamires, another ex-Minister of
New Street, was responsible for the History of the Wesleyan Methodist Church
in Victoria, published in 1886. He later wrote a short history of the Brighton
Circuit published in the "Spectator" in 1912.
To him and to his work we are largely indebted for the following
information, in so far as it covers the first fifty years.
In 1848, as the result of a suggestion by the minister's wife to Mr. Thos.
Ricketts, who was concerned at the lack of care for the children, he com-
menced a Sunday School. He soon gathered thirty children, and, with the
aid of Mrs. Battrick and Mr. John Sayers, started the first Sunday School in
Brighton in the old Church.
In 1850 Mr. Jas. Webb took charge, and Mr. Ricketts accepted the post
of visitor, which he held for 14 years, Mr. Webb was in charge of the School
for ten years, until 1860, except from 1854 to 1856, when he visited England
with his family, and Mr. John Baker was Superintendent.
There appear to be no actual records of these early days, but the
teachers' meetings, held monthly in each other's houses, provided the means
of control and direction of the School.
PRESENT SUNDAY SCHOOL.
The first available Minute Book dates from 1861, and contains the names
of many early workers, including Messrs. Webb, John Baker, Gideon Baker,
William Harbison, John Gifford, Joseph Knowles, William German, Rigg, and
John Hicks.
The list of the Superintendents from the inception of the School provides
a very interesting link with those early days. The names are: —Messrs.
Thos. Ricketts (1849), J. Webb (1850), J. Baker (1854), J. Webb (1856), —. Flint


(1860), J. Baker (1862), I. Williams (1864), J. Knowles (1870-1882), J. Gifford
(1875-77), G. Baker (1881-91), J. H. Marsden (1883-85), W. Hill (1888-94), J.
Germon (1892-95), A. Kinsman (1895-96), W. J. Williamson (ex-M.L.C., now
of Portland) (1896-97), W. Moulton (1897-99), P. Oakden (1899), F. Hinrichsen
(1899-1901), W. Moulton (1901-08), Rev. P. Knight (1908-10), S. Cooper
(1910-13), C. H. Green (1913-16), A. Scott (1916-23), G. A. Giles (1923-34), A. T.
Latham (1934-40), Lieut. W. B. Russell (1940—0 n leave), G. A. Giles (1940- ).
The apparent duplication in the " 'eighties" is due to the custom of having
two Superintendents—one to take charge of the morning and one of the
afternoon School.
During the absence on leave of Mr. Giles for four months in 1931, Mr.
W. F. Cock, the esteemed leader of the Young Men's Bible Class for many
years, acted as Superintendent.
It is impossible to find who held the position of Secretary before 1862, but
from that year the list is complete, as follows:—Messrs. T. W. Williams (1862-
65), J. Williams (1865-67), G. Baker (1867-77), J. Germon (1877-80), A. Hutchinson
(1880), D. Harbison (1880-82), —. Greenwood (1882-84), J. Germon (1884-92),
W. J. Williamson (1892-94), T. Adamson (1894-95), J. Campbell (1895-96),
C. R. Derrick (1896-1900), A. D. Kinsman (1900-08), F. Hinrichsen (1908-23),
E. C. Outhred (1923-25), W. G. Caddy (1925-40), F. N. Thomas (joint, 1930-32),
H. Penrose (joint, 1934-40), G. R. Bruns (1940- ),
The list of present Officers and Teachers of the School is given elsewhere.
The appointment in 1910 of Mr. John Robinson as Conductor for the
Sunday School Anniversary saw the commencement of the splendid work
that he has carried on ever since, with the exception of one year (1940).
Under his enthusiastic and efficient leadership the singing by the scholars
has been an outstanding feature of the Anniversary Services through the
years, and we are glad of this opportunity to express to him our sincere
appreciation and thanks.
It will be of interest to note that Mr. Robinson, who was a teacher for
25 years, first came to New Street Sunday School as a very little boy, over
60 years ago, and may therefore claim one of the longest associations with
this Church.
Of recent years our Sunday School has been faced with the familiar
problems common to this work, but which appear to have been accentuated
by the general drift from religion, the loosening of home life, and increasing
demands of leisure and pleasure.
In an effort to combat the drift, the Officers and Teachers, after very
careful consideration and after consultation with parents, decided in May, 1940,
to change the hour of meeting from 2.45 p.m. to 11.30 a.m. The children now
assemble with the congregation for the morning service, occupying several
front seats, and at 11.30 adjourn to the School and class-rooms. Whilst the
system may not be ideal, the results to date have been encouraging, in that
the average attendance has increased from 41 in April, 1940, to 49 in
August, 1941. The gathering of the children has certainly strengthened the
morning congregations, although possibly at the expense of the evening
attendances.
At present the number of scholars on the rolls is 75, while there are
25 officers and teachers.
An interesting newspaper report of the 53rd Anniversary in 1902 has been
shown us. "Crowded attendances greeted the preacher, Professor Sugden,
at the three services on Sunday, notably the evening congregation, which


filled the Church and necessitated chairs being placed in vacant corners."
The School then had 22 teachers and officers, and 92 scholars, with an
average attendance of 71%.
At the social gathering on the Monday evening, the Superintendent, Mr.
Moulton, "presented a gold brooch with diamonds, and bracelet with pearls,
to Miss Gifford from her past and present scholars and the officers of the
School, for her unwearied efforts as an earnest teacher lor many years."
During its long history the School has been blessed with a succession
of faithful workers, who have carried on the work through varying conditions.
We have again been tempted to refer to individual teachers who have
given earnest service over many years. The space required to mention
those whom we can recall is considerable, and we fear that some names
might be overlooked, so that we have been constrained to omit individual
references.
We would, however, acknowledge with grateful appreciation their
devotion and sacrifice. By their loyal and unassuming service, cheerfully
given year in and year out, they have made an invaluable contribution
to the Kingdom of Christ, and to the best welfare of the children under their
charge. We feel sure that their work in the Sunday School has been done
as unto the Lord, and they have not lacked their reward.
Nor do we forget the present group, whose devotion and activity mark
them as worthy successors of those who have built and laboured and have
now entered into rest.
"One generation shall praise thy works to another, and shall declare
thy mighty acts. They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great
goodness, and shall sing of thy righteousness." (Psalm 46.,'
DENOMINATIONAL DAY SCHOOLS.
Before the Government undertook the responsibility for education, schools
were established throughout Victoria by the various Churches. There were
several such Schools in the district which originally comprised the Brighton
Circuit, and a good deal of information is available in the minute books
regarding them. We confine our remarks, however, to the School which was
associated with the New Street Church.
It was governed by a Local Board, later called 'the School Committee,
of which the Minister acted as Chairman. The School was opened on Ist
March, 1855, in portion of the Church buildings, and was under the control
of Mr. James Barker and Mrs. Barker as master and mistress. There were
37 scholars on the roll.
In addition to the School fees, a Government grant was received which,
according to a record dated 31st March, 1862, amounted to £l4O, apparently
representing the salaries of the schoolmaster and mistress—£loo and £4O
respectively.
At this date, Mr. and Mrs. Fraser were in charge of the School, and
there were 65 children on the roll, although the average attendance was
only 35. At the same time, Little Brighton, under the control of Mr. and
Mrs. Webb, and with 69 scholars on the School roll, had an average of
50 in attendance.


The School continued under the direction of the Church until the end
of 1873. At the meeting of the School Committee held on 28th November
of that year, it was resolved "that this Committee (so far as we can) transfer
the staff of teachers and School to the Education Department." The manage-
ment was to be handed over to the School Board of Advice.
On the same date the Trustees decided to offer the Schoolroom to the
Government for six months at £4 per month, from Monday to Friday, and
from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., on condition that the Schoolroom be cleaned out on
Monday and Friday evenings, and that the Government keep the premises
in repair.
Mr. Wrigley was the Headmaster of the School at the time of the transfer.
There are some of our folk, including Mr. T. Tucker, Mr. and Miss Ruddle,
Mrs. Clark, and others, who attended this School when it was under the
control of the Church, and still recall those early days.
REGISTER OF BAPTISMS.
A book of most interesting contents is the "Register of Baptisms of the
Brighton Circuit," in which the first entry reads as follows:
No. I—February 4th, 1854; Josephine Speckman PRIESTLY, daughter of
Enos Priestly and Sarah his wife. Edward Sweetman, W.M.
(The Brighton Circuit was established in 1852, but no earlier records of
baptisms have been found.)
Entry No. 3 is: February 19th, 1854—Alfred James, son of Alfred Hurlstone
and Mary, his wife. Edward Sweetman, W.M.
(The profession and residence of Mr. Hurlstone are given as Miller, of
River Plenty.)
On January 7th, 1855, appears the record of the first baptism of twins—
Anne and Elizabeth—the infant daughters of Samuel Thatcher and Jane, his
wife, of Moorabbin.
During his ministry from 1854 to 1857, the Rev. Jas. Bickford baptised
135 children.
It is not possible in such a long list of names to know which to include
in a reference of this kind, but the names continually appear of those pioneers
who were so closely connected with this Church and Circuit, such as Stone,
Head, Alford, Gifford, German, Draper. The last name appears twice in an
interesting entry dated August 31st, 1861, recording that the Rev. D. J. Draper,
of revered memory, baptised Emily Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Webb
Draper and Frances Rebecca his wife.
A reflection of ihe way of life in Brighton in the earlier years is seen
in the professions or occupations of the fathers, a large proportion of whom
were described as farmers or gardeners.
This original book, in an excellent state of preservation, is still in use
at New Street, although with the appointment of ministers to other Churches
in the Circuit, they have established their own baptismal registers.
The last baptism, performed by Dr. Atkinson, is numbered 1750, although
unfortunately there is a page many years back containing 16 entries which
have not been numbered.
