This pamphlet is published to call special attention to the immense
commercial value of tropical products—especially sugar —to the
Northern Territory. The facts and statistics of the sugar
industry, and the conditions of colored labor in Queensland, are
furnished to give the necessary information to stimulate enterprise
in the Northern Territory. The reports quoted on pp. 26-31
establish conclusively that the necessary conditions of soil and climate
for tropical agriculture exist in the Northern Territory. The
official report of the Acting Agent-General of Fiji, and the letter of
Dr. Cunningham, late of the West Indies, which will be found on
pp. 32-9, prove that the coolies, who are available under the
“Indian Im7nigration Act,” are the most suitable a7id economical
labor that can be obtained for the Northern Territory.

THE SUGAR INDUSTRY
IN THE
MACKAY DISTRICT,
The area of the Mackay sugar district is 1,366,000 acres, of
which about 500,000 acres have been selected, and probably two-
thirds of the land is suited for tropical agriculture. The Pioneer
river runs through the country, and the town of Mackay is situate
on its southern bank. The main coast range bounds it landward
between Cape Palmerston on the south and Cape Conway on the
north
The fine sugar-producing lands are rich dark loam, and are,
variously, plain, forest, and scrub or jungle. The plains are
covered with what is locally called cane grass. The best forest
land is heavily grassed, and the acacia is the sure indication of
richness. The scrub or jungle country is very dense and luxuriant.
The great advantage of this land is that the canes can be cut four
or five years in succession, while in the forest and plain land it is
not usual to cut them more than twice.
The country now occupied by planters was originally three
cattle stations, whose annual rents did not reach £5OO, and all the
labor employed was a few station hands.
The first cane was planted in 1864 by Mr. J. Spiller. Maize
and cotton had been previously tried ; the maize was not a success,
and the cotton was a failure.
In 1867, enough cane was grown to plant 140 acres and year
by year the area under crop steadily increased. The first sugar
mill was started on the Alexandra estate on September 14th,
1868, and at the end of that season, working eighty-nine days, the
product of 120 acres was crushed, yielding 230 tons of sugar,
h rom this date new plantations and mills were commenced.
The average yield of sugar per acre for the district, extending
over several years, is about one and a half tons. It is calculated
that with plant, cane, and ratoons, about sixteen tons of cane are
crushed for one ton of sugar. This would give an average ?rop of
cane of twenty-four tons to the acre. Under very favorable condi-
j}
\ ■ >v . . » v
sSp


tions as much as forty-five tons of cane to the acre have been cut,
and various quantities below this are obtained, according to soil
and season. In the Clarence district in New South Wales, where
the canes are of two years’ growth, I was informed, as much as
ninety-four tons to the acre have been taken off.
In the year 1875 the bourbon cane was in general cultivation.
It is a large juicy cane, but liable to rust, and in this year the dis-
ease attacked the canes very severely, and for a time paralysed the
industry. During several succeeding years confidence in the per-
manence of sugar manufacture as a profitable investment was
much shaken. In 1874 the crop yielded 5,480 tons; in 1875 it
fell to 2,527 ; and in 1876, though the prospects had become more
hopeful, only 3,412 tons were produced. Between 1875 and 1879
no new plantations were commenced. In 1877 the bourbon cane
had been replaced by the meera, rose bamboo, otawata, big ribbon,
and big yellow. Now the creole is receiving favorable attention,
and the lahinia is highly spoken of. In 1877 and in 1878 the
crop was about 7,000 tons, and in 1879 it reached 10,000 tons.
In 1880 confidence was once more thoroughly established, and
planting was greatly extended. In 1881 several plantations
changed hands at very high figures. The Pioneer estate, con-
taining about 5,000 acres, and having a mill capable of an output
of 1,000 tons, was purchased by Mr. McKinnon, of Victoria, for
£95,000. During 1881-2, when money was plentiful, there was a
rapid rise in the value of both plantations and selected land.
Eand taken up at ss. per acre, on which no clearing had been
done, is now worth, in some instances, £5 per acre. The Colonial
Sugar Company purchased in 1881 about 10,000 acres, which was
originally selected at ss. and 10s. per acre, at an average price of
£3 10s. This company succeeded, in the session of 1881, in
getting a Private Bill 'passed, enabling them to obtain the certifi-
cates of title in anticipation of the fulfilment of the conditions by
the original selectors. It came out in evidence that the company
propose to expend on their three Queensland plantations —one on
the Herbert, one on the Johnson, one at Mackay—£soo,ooo.
They are bound by the Act to expend £200,000 before the certifi-
cates can issue.
On the sixteen estates in the Mackay district in full working,
in 1880, the mill power was estimated at 12,000 tons per annum.
The following is a complete list of the plantations on the north
and the south sides of the Pioneer river, with their mill power
approximately given in each case, and these mills will be at work
for the crushing of 1883. These figures show that the mill power


of the district has increased from 12,000 tons in 1880 to nearly
30,000 tons in 1883

to the drought the crops were 30 per cent, below estimates.

From information obtained from those who have thoroughly
analysed the whole subject of sugar cultivation and manufacture,
it requires an expenditure of £4O per ton on the milling capacities
of the estates. The figures above show that the milling capacity
at present amounts to nearly 30,000 tons; and it is safe to state,
therefore, that no less a sum than £1,200,000 is invested in the
Mackay district alone in the cultivation and manufacture of sugar.
The total yield for this year in the Mackay district is expected to
reach 20,000 tons, and an equal quantity will probably be produced
in the other sugar-growing districts of Queensland, making 40,000
tons of the 120,000 tons annually required for the markets of
Australasia. The total production of sugar in New South Wales
is about 8,000 tons, against a consumption of 30,000 tons. From
an official report, “ On the Sugar Industry on the Clarence and
Richmond rivers,” by Mr. A. Meston, and which was laid before
Parliament, it appears that the sugar industry on these rivers is
not progressing. It is of course the heavy import duty of £5 per
ton that alone admits of the profitable cultivation of sugar in New
South Wales by white labor. In the tropics Europeans cannot do
the work in the fields.
NOTES OF A TRIP AMONG THE MACKAY SUGAR
PLANTATIONS.
Mackay is situate 625 miles to the north of Brisbane. I landed
on Flat-top Island, and inspected the lighthouse. Flat-top Island
is to Mackay what Granite Island is to Victor Harbor. There is a
very striking similarity between the two places in the sweep of the
coast and the position of the island. A commencement has also
been made of a breakwater from the point, but the works at pre-
sent are at a standstill.
On reaching Mackay I was most cordially met by M. Hume
Black, Esq., M.L.A., who represents the Mackay district in the
Legislative Assembly, who is one of the pioneer sugar planters,
who has for many years closely studied the whole question of sugar
cultivation and manufacture, and from whom I derived much
information.
Mr. Black’s plantation is called the Cedars, which is situate on
the summit of a moderately high hill.
The next morning was spent in an inspection of the mill, the
outbuildings, the stables, and the Kanaka quarters. These last
consist of wooden buildings, raised about 4ft. off the ground on
piles, with a large open space for a fire in the centre. The “ boys”


insist on the fire as a necessity. They lie down on the hoards,
wrapped in a blanket, and sleep more soundly than many who
possess a luxurious couch. There are also quarters for Europeans,
and also for the married Kanakas. From a local paper the follow-
ing description of the Cedars is taken :
“ The Cedars, the property of Mr. M. Hume Black, is situated on
the north side of the river, and affords a good example of the hill
system of cultivation, which has proved eminently successful in this
district. The extent of the estate is 2,156 acres, of which 298
are under cultivation. Of the area cultivated upwards of two-
thirds are what are known as scrub lands. The hills, which were
originally covered with heavy scrub timber, have been cleared, and,
though the surface then presented was found to be stony and
precipitous to a great degree, the soil proved to be so rich and
naturally well drained that very heavy crops have been and
continue to be taken off. The description of this hill culture
will be found in another place. The mill is by the well-
known maker Fletcher, and like all that manufacturer’s work
is remarkable for the proportionate strength of all its parts. The
boilers, of which there are two, have a joint capability of being
worked up to about 40 h.p. The works themselves do not differ
much from those on the majority of estates, with the exception of
the battery, which is locally famous for being one of the quickest
in the colony. It is of the description known as a flat battery, but
the bottom is more curved than is usual in such batteries, and its
extra efficiency is probably in a great measure due to the excellent
draught of the flues and stack, and its great evaporating surface.
The centrifugals here are Weston’s patent, and being driven by a
powerful small engine can be worked up to a great speed, thus
securing the best results in drying the sugars. There are four
evaporating pans built in the mill-house on a principle closely allied
to that known as the Gadsden. In an ordinary season the works
can produce 350 tons of sugar. The principal point of interest
to a visitor to the Cedars is the tramway which has recently been
constructed. Leaving the mill we at once step into the trucks,
which runs close alongside the rollers. With one horse attached
the train of four trucks starts away smoothly and evenly. The
line throughout has a northerly direction in the main, but owing
to the hilly nature of the country to be traversed there are several
curves to the east and west, Mr. Black having considered it better
to wind round the ridges than to go to the expense of cuttings.
The line, after leaving the mill yard, runs over the hollow back of
a neighboring spur, and then runs straight for about half a mile


across a slight embankment. For half the distance mentioned the
line dips, and then rises again, the gradients in these cases being
about lin 20. We now reach one of the steepest places on the
line, and the horse finds its stiffest pull up a hill of about 200
yards having a gradient of lin 14. After reaching the summit
the brakes are brought into requisition, and the train is steadied
down the decline which takes us to the road running north
between the Cedars and Richmond plantations. Keeping parallel
with the fence for some distance, we reach a spot where large
stacks of cordwood are piled ready to be put on the trucks.
Here the horse is taken out, and we proceed on foot to the end of
the line, which at this point bears off into the scrub - clad
hills in a westerly direction. It would be impossible to describe the
tortuous windings of this las" quarter of a mile, but up and down
as the line goes it has been found to answer its purpose admirably
in bringing down the fuel which has been cut on either side of it.
The plan adopted here is to take the trucks up to the end of the
line and when loaded let them run, with a man in charge of the
brake to prevent too high a speed being attained, and it is found
that the train gets sufficient impetus to be carried over the rises,
and runs down clear outside the scrub into the open country, where
the horses can be attached. The rails are of 3x 2 hardwood, on
edge, laid upon sleepers of yellow wood, cedar, and hardwood. The
sleepers have an average bearing surface of sin. and are carefully
notched to receive the rails, which are spiked to them with 6in.
spikes. The sleepers are placed 2ft. apart, centre to centre, and to
the closeness of the sleepers and the care with which they are
bedded is attributable the smoothness and stability of the line. The
timber rails are spliced with regular carpenter’s joints, and one
very noticeable feature in the whole work is the very even and
smooth appearance that the lines present. Working the trains has
shown at what points in the curves the greatest amount of grinding
has taken place, and at these spots the rails have been plated with
iron plates £in. thick. The trucks are very simple in their
construction, being built of hardwood, with a floor 4ft. x 6ft., with
two hardwood uprights at each end. Being so very close to the
ground, they may be loaded very conveniently, and when properly
filled they carry half a cord of wood each, or about 18cwt. of cane.
Mr. Black finds that it is better not to overload the trucks, and
prefers to let them travel at a steady pace rather than allow them
to run down the slopes. The building of the trucks is simplicity
itself. Two side pieces, with end pieces mortised into them, form
the frame, and the floor is nailed or bolted on the upper side, the


bearings for the axles being bolted beneath. The axles are l|in.
in diameter, and the wheels have a diameter of lOin. and a tread of
2in. The total length of the line is five chains short of two miles,
but it is very probable that, having regard to the economic value of the
line, Mr. Black will make a branch line, which will run in a half circle
to the western side of the estate, and would pass around the base of the
scrub land hills, where some large fields of cane are now growing.
An inquiry into the total cost of the construction of the line results
in the most satisfactory figures, as we find that the material and
labor for this line cost £l2O per mile, and the trucks cost from
£3 10s. to £4 each. It will be easily seen how valuable such a
line as we have described must be when we state that contractors
with bullock teams would not bring down cordwood from the place
where it is stacked at less than four shillings per cord, and it is
found that three men for loading, attending to the brakes, and
driving the horses, and two horses, can easily deliver 100 cords per
week at the mill. The line we have described is merely an
experimental one, constructed for the purpose of ascertaining
practically the value of such a work, and the result is such that it
is probable that before long the line will be added to by branch
lines penetrating the canefields in all directions.”
There is something very novel in the spectacle of so many dark
faces and forms, and woolly heads, in the houses and on the roads
and in the fields. Judging from personal observation on a large
number of plantations, many of which were visited without any
notice, I have no hesitation in stating that they present a healthy
and happy appearance. They are allowed practically as much
bread and beef as they can eat with safety to their own healths,
and also a sufficient quantity of sweet potatoes and rice. They
receive two suits of clothes every year, and are in every sense well
cared for by the planters. On no occasion did I see any attempt
at ill-usage. I did not even hear a harsh or angry word. In fact
the planters all feel that their interests are bound up with the
welfare of their laborers —in a word, that it pays to keep them in
comfort and contentment. They receive at the end of their three
years’ engagement £lB, i.e., at the rate of £6 per annum, which
they usually spend in the purchase of a miscellaneous kit, beginning
with a gun, with which they return to their islands, and mainly
with a view to astonish their home-staying friends. Often, how-
ever, after the first novelty of their splendour is over, they become
tired of the monotony of the Pacific isles—and the shortness and
uncertainty of their meals-and they gladly re-engage for another
three years’ term on a sugar plantation in Queensland.


After a good look round at the Cedars, Mr. Black and I started
out on a tour through some of the plantations on the northern side
of the river. Taking the main road to Bowen, we passed through
the Miclere estate, formerly the property of Messrs. Carroll and
Avery, but now owned by Sir John Bennet Lawes. This is a fine
estate, and embraces both forest and scrub or jungle land. The
total area is 1,100 acres, of which a large portion is under cultiva-
tion. The mill is one of Walker’s, of Maryborough, and can
manufacture 400 tons per year. Crushing was commenced on this
estate in 1872.
Passing on, the road goes through some dense scrub or jungle.
This description of land costs about £3 10s. per acre to clear, the
work being done by Europeans.
On the north side we passed the Narbrook plantation, which
comprises about 640 acres, in which but few permanent improve-
ments have been made. Notwithstanding this, however, the estate
has recently been purchased by Sir J. B. Lawes for the sum of
£10,400, or over £l5 per acre.
The Farleigh plantation, also owned by Sir J. B. Lawes, we
reached about 1 o’clock, and received a planter’s welcome from
the general manager of Sir J. B. Lawes’s estates, Mr. Robert
Walker, who is also the chairman of the divisional board. Before
lunch, we examined the numerous and complete plans of the mill,
which have been supplied by Mirlees, Watson, & Co., of Glasgow.
This mill, which contains all the latest improvements in sugar
manufacturing, will cost, when erected, from £25,000 to £30,000.
Fully 2,000 tons will be manufactured in the season. The weight
of the rollers is and 7 tons, the weight of the three being
over 20 tons.
After lunch we had thorough inspection of the premises,
visiting the quarters for Kanakas, Europeans, and overseers, which
are very extensive, and all brand new. There are 250 Kanakas
employed on the estate, and over forty Europeans are on the
monthly pay-sheet. The stables are 250 ft. long. The stall accom-
modation is for eighty horses, being forty on each side, with a
tramway between for the running up of fodder from the stores. A
splendid boring-machine is at work to provide the necessary
amount of water. The present depth reached is about 24ft., and
the bore is now in rotten granite, below w r hich diorite boulders are
expected, and permanent and sufficient water will probably not be
reached under 100 ft. The cost of getting this plantation, which
contains 2,500 acres, into working order, including machinery,
clearing, and cultivating, up to the time of crushing (but entirely


exclusive of the purchase of the land), will be £60,000 — i.e ., that
amount of money, in addition to the purchase of the land, will be
spent before there will be a single penny of return upon the outlay.
It is a fact like this which indicates the confidence which capitalists
must have in the prospects of the sugar industry. It also clearly
indicates that, if the cultivation of sugar is to be successfully
carried on in the Northern Territory, it will be absolutely necessary
to win the confidence of capitalists, as well as to make provision for
the introduction of Coolie labor.
Leaving Farleigh, w r e soon entered on the Pioneer estate, and
for three miles drove through the fine undulating country on
which the sugar-cane is planted and is richly thriving. This
estate was at one time known as the Ashburton estate, and was
the property of Mr. J. Spiller. It consists of 4,242 acres. The
mill, which is one of Mirlees, Tait, & Watson’s, of Glasgow, is very
complete, and is equal to a production of 1,500 tons annually.
There are eight centrifugal and seven steam pumps. The water
for the mill is conveyed from the creek, a distance of 1,300 feet,
in a 6-inch main. There are two batteries in the works, one round
and one flat, and a s|-ton vacuum pan. There is also a railway,
two and a half miles long, for bringing cane and fuel to the works.
This estate employs about 200 Kanakas and sixty Europeans,
and, in addition to several large bullock teams, works over 130
horses. I have already mentioned that this estate was purchased
by Mr. McKinnon, of Melbourne, for £95,000, and the first year
he took off it a crop of sugar worth over £20,000.
It is now proposed to erect a large new mill with all the modem
appliances and improvements on this estate next year. After look-
ing at the mill premises, the comfortable planter’s house, the out-
buildings, and the large shed in which the cane carts are housed,
we skirted a lagoon, covered with waterlilies, and evidently the
favorite and protected haunt of innumerable wild fowl.
The Foulden plantation was next reached. The original owner
of this estate was Mr. Amhurst, who formerly represented the
district in the Queensland Assembly. Sir J. Bennet Lawes is now
the proprietor of this plantation. It is a very compact estate, and
the mill is furnished with excellent machinery. The charcoal
process is in use, and as a consequence the sugars produced are
among the finest in the districts Golden syrup is also manufactured
in this mill. The premises are very complete, and the manager’s
residence is very prettily situate. At present Mr. Walker resides
at Foulden, but he contemplates removing to Farleigh when the
manager’s residence is erected on that plantation.


Our next halt was at the River plantation. This is the property
of Mr. J. Spiller. It comprises about 2,355 acres, and the area under
crop this year is about 1,400 acres. The mill is one of the finest
in the district, and is by Mirlees, Tait, & Watson. There is one
multitubular and two Cornish boilers, five engines (with a total of
48 h.p.), four Weston’s and two Manlove & Alliott’s centrifugals,
two round batteries, six clarifiers, twenty-three coolers, cane and
megass (the dried crushed cane) carriers, and vacuum pan. There
is a railway more than three miles in extent, on which a small
locomotive with trucks conveys the cane or firewood to the
works, where a 10-ton weighbridge keeps check upon the
deliveries of both. The manager of this mill, Mr. Percy Greece,
most obligingly conducted us over the mill and out-buildings,
which are undoubtedly in a very complete state. The yield
of the crushing last year was 1,400 tons, which realised
an average price of £23 per ton. We were shown white sugar
which is realising £33 per ton in Mackay. The prospective yield
for the coming year is estimated at 2,000 tons. The plantation is
one of the oldest in the district, and has been under cultivation
about twelve years. A new mill for crushing cane and boiling the
juice is about to be erected on the northern portion of the estate,
and the juice from this will be brought down to the mill. The
number of Kanakas on the books is 254, the number of Europeans
fifty-seven. One hundred and twenty working horses are in
constant employment, and the horse-feed account has amounted
during the past three months to over £lOO per month. The
butcher’s bill for the supply of meat to the plantation hands
averages nearly £9O per month. Here, as elsewhere, the Kanakas,
in various degrees of light garments, with here and there a gay
color somewhere shown on the attire, looked plump and happy.
Few things, indeed, are more cheerful than the grin in the face of
a Polynesian who evidently has had enough to eat and can show r a
fine set of natural ivories. After remaining for a rest in Mr.
Greece’s pleasant quarters, we struck into the main road, and
returned to the Cedars.
Thursday morning, February 18th, was spent in another look
over Mr. Black’s plantation. In the afternoon we paid a visit to
Mackay, in order to see the town by daylight. The town every-
where exhibits signs of activity and prosperity, of which, of course,
the sugar industry is the mainspring and the mainstay. The
hotels are large and well furnished. The shops of the store-
keepers are numerous. A new post office is nearly complete,
which is to be supplemented by a telegraph station. We called


upon the mayor, who expressed his pleasure at seeing a member
of the Government of South Australia visiting Mackay.
On our return we called at the Glen Albyn estate, the property
of Messrs. Mcßride, Finlay&on, & Poolman, who gave us a very
hearty welcome. These gentlemen also own the Richmond and
Inverness plantations, and are contemplating erecting new and
improved milling machinery.
Early on Friday morning, February 9th, we started, and after
crossing the river, followed the main Homebush-road, which
passes through heavily-timbered forest land, in which gums, black-
wood, and acacia are the prevalent varieties where the soil is good,
and the poplar gum where the soil is poor. The distance from the
Cedars to the Homebush mill is about eighteen miles.
The Homebush estate, with adjacent lands, which is now the
property of the Colonial Sugar Company, comprises an area of
about 13,000 acres. This year on the Homebush plantation there
are about 300 acres planted. There are 700 acres in course of
planting, which will be ready for crushing this season, and in
addition the company have made arrangements to purchase about
400 acres of canes from smaller growers. About fourteen miles of
permanent tramway on the 2ft. gauge of Fowler Sc Co. is being
laid down, and about fifteen miles of portable tramways will be in
operation to bring in the cane from the company’s and the local
growers’ fields. The labor at present located at Homebush is—
eighty-seven Kanakas, eighty Chinese (who are under engage-
ment at 13s. per week with rations), and 120 Cingalese, out of
198 who were recently imported. With these 120 Cingalese
the company have entered into new agreements under which,
instead of receiving £2O per annum and finding themselves,
they now are to receive tenpence per day and rations. But
as the Cingalese demand payment of the amount due to them
to date, and the manager requires the execution of the
new agreements first, a misunderstanding, which amounts to a
strike, has arisen. We found all the Cingalese, except a few
house servants, off work waiting the settlement of this question.
In addition to the colored labor employed in cultivation,
there are 200 Europeans at present on the books of the
company. We had received an invitation to lunch from the
manager (Mr. Robertson), who has recently come up from the
Clarence river, in New South Wales, to take the superintendence
of the company’s operations in the Mackay district. We were
most kindly entertained, and with Mr. Robertson, the engineer
(Mr. Kydd, who has erected the large mills of the company


in Fiji, and elsewhere), and the overseer, we made a tour of
inspection. The mill is one of the largest and completest in
Australia. No expense has been spared to put down the latest
improvements in manufacture. It is expected, when in full working
order, to produce 5,000 tons per year. The rollers weigh eight
tons each; and there are six centrifugals in position, 48in. in
diameter, and a foundation for a seventh of equal dimensions. The
site of the mill, in the midst of a great undeveloped area of sugar-
land, is a scene of busy activity.
No expense is spared to economise the cost of production. A
bridge is about to be thrown across the Sandy Creek, at a cost of
about £2,000, to bring in the cane grown on the other side ; and
sidings for 500 trucks are being laid alongside the mill for the
night supply during the crushing season. The dwellings for the
colon d labor, the ordinary European laborers, the artisans and
engineers, the sheds and stables, are very extensive, making the
site of the mill a township, in which a school will shortly require
to be erected. Steam ploughs, with four shares, and capable of
turning over fifteen acres in the day, have been brought round from
Mackay at a great expenditure of money and trouble, are at work.
There can be no doubt that this company are satisfied that the sugar
industry generally, and the conditions existing in Mackay, give
good prospects for the future. Land in the district which comes
between two sections held by the company, which was selected a
few years ago at ss. per acre, is now under offer to them at £5 7s. fid.
per acre, and, large as the price appears, there is a probability that
in a year or two it will not be purchasable even at this figure.
From Homebush we made for the plantation of the Oakenden
Sugar Company. This estate is about 5,000 acres in extent, and
recently belonged to Mr. A. Kemmiss, an old settler in the district.
It has now been disposed of to a Melbourne company, Mr. Kem-
miss retaining a fifth share, and holding the appointment of general
manager. There are between 300 and 400 acres in cane this year,
and arrangements have been made on certain conditions for the
purchase of the cane grown on the plantation during the
next two years by the Colonial Sugar Company, for crushing
at Homebush, at 10s. per ton in the field, i.e., the company
cut and carry the cane from the fields to the mill. On this planta-
tion we also found some Cingalese, who, as elsewhere, are a source
of great trouble. It is very plain that the importation of this
steamer load of immigrants has created a great prejudice without
furnishing the planters with suitable labor. We stopped at
Oakenden for the night.


Leaving Oakenden early, we reached a township which bears the
classic name of Eton. This is to be the terminus of the railway
along the southern bank of the Pioneer river from Mackay. The
permanent survey is now nearly complete ; the money is voted by
Parliament, and in a year or two the locomotive will be travelling
through the canefields. The effect of this railway will be to
greatly reduce the land carriage from the mills to the port of ship-
ment. It will also lead to the opening up of sugar lands along the
route, and when extended, as it is to be, further inland, will much
increase the area of sugar cultivation. It is also intended to seek
early parliamentary sanction for a line on the northern bank of the
Pioneer, so that the plantations situate there, and the country
lying outside the present estates, may enjoy the same advantages.
From Eton we passed through stony, ridgy country, with poor soil
on the ridges, but with rich land in the flats and on the lower
slopes, to Walkerston, another township, the distance being about
ten miles.
On the south of the road to Walkerston is the Barrie estate and
mill, which is owned by Messrs. D. Jack Sc Son. Its area is about
1,300 acres, and between 300 and 400 acres are under cane. The
producing capabilities are about 1,400 tons.
On the north is the Victoria mill, which is owned by the
Mackay Sugar Company. This mill is worked almost entirely on
the central mill system. The company have a smallquantity under
crop, but they will rely mainly upon the crops they will purchase
from the small growers.
At Walkerston, which boasts of three hotels and some stores,
we found a letter awaiting us, inviting us to the residence of J.
Ewin Davidson, Esq., at Alexandra, where, on arrival, we received
a most courteous welcome. Mr. Davidson formed the Alexandra
estate, but it has now passed into the hands of the Melbourne-Mackay
Sugar Company, who own several other estates. Mr. Davidson is a
large shareholder in the company, and is also the general manager.
Cane was first planted at Alexandra in 1867, and the first crushing
took place in 1868. The estate consists of 2,500 acres, of which
about 700 are under cultivation. The mill capacity is over 800
tons. There is also a still which can produce 550 hhds. of rum
per annum.
Mr. Davidson drove me for some miles through luxuriant cane-
fields, and on the return we called at the Pleystow estate. This
propertybelonged, up to a short time since, to Messrs. A. Hewitt and
Co., but was then sold to a Melbourne company for £58,000. The
area is about 5,000 acres, with about 1,000 under crop. The


mill is estimated to be equal to the production of 1,200 tons of
sugar. Here also there is a still, where the famous “ Anchor”
brand of rum is made, which secured a first prize both at the
Brisbane Show in 1877, and at the Sydney International Exhibition
in 1879-80. We looked through the mill, and also the Kanaka
quarters and hospital. The manager, who accompanied us, informed
me that when any of the “ boys” appear to be shamming they are
ordered into the hospital and kept on the prescribed hospital diet
and physic. If they are playing the old soldier they soon get well
and offer themselves for work. In case of real sickness they receive
every care and attention. The plantations in the district, it should
be mentioned, are regularly visited by a medical man.
Close by is the Branscombe estate, which formerly belonged to
G. H. M. King, Esq., but is now the property of the Melbourne-
Mackay Sugar Company, of which Mr. King is a large shareholder.
The extent of land is about 1,400 acres, of which over 600 are
cultivated. The mill can produce 600 tons of sugar, and the
Branscombe sugars have secured medals in Brisbane and Sydney.
After leaving Pleystow we reached the Palms estate, also the
property of the Melbourne-Mackay Sugar Company. This is one
of the most valuable plantations in the district, and the mill is the
largest and most complete in working order in Queensland. The
mill will, however, be eclipsed by those now being erected at Home-
bush and Farleigh. The Melbourne-Mackay Sugar Company now
own about 10,('00 acres, and have, I was informed, a larger
quantity of rich land than any other proprietors in the district.
The following account of the Palms is from the Mackay
Standard :—
“ This estate, which forms one part of the Melbourne-Mackay
Queensland Sugar Company’s large property, may be justly re-
garded as the largest in the district. Work was commenced here
during the season now drawing to a close, and though the crop
produced this season is only estimated to amount to about 700 tons
there is not the least doubt that next year it will be more than
double that amount. The Palms mill is situated on the north side
of the Nebo main road, between Te Kowai and Branscombe, at a
distance uf a little over eight miles from town. The land is of
the same rich and productive nature as that found on the neighbor-
ing estates, and will certainly produce fully the average quantity
of the cane per acre yielded by the district generally. Upwards
of 1,500 acres are now under cultivation on this estate, which has
been obtained by amalgamating the Washpool plains, the Palms
paddock, what was formerly known as Lome, and a considerable


portion of the land formerly forming part of the Alexandra and
Te Kowai estates. The plant is entirely the product of the firm of
Mirlees, Tait, k Watson, of Glasgow ; and it is calculated that
by the time that sufficient material is grown some small additions
to the works will enable the mill to turn out 2,000 tons of sugar in
the crushing season. The rollers of the mill are 66in. x 30in.,
and the process here adopted differs but slightly from that in use
on the other estates of the company. The old fashioned battery
is entirely superseded by the adoption of Aspinall pans, which have
come into great favor in this district. It would be needless for us
to attempt a minute discription of the whole of the machinery
employed at these works. The juice, after it is expressed, is
pumped to the clarifiers in the upper floor, when, after temper-
ing, it is subsided and conveyed to the Aspinall pans, which have
the appearance of huge inverted hats. Having become concen-
trated here to the desired extent, it is run off to the subsiders,
from which it is drawn into the vacuum pan, a large goose-
necked vessel. When the sugar is boiled, large coolers, which
run on a railway underneath the pan, are brought beneath the
outlet, and the sugar is let into them ready for the process of
drying in the Weston’s centrifugals. These latter machines are
fitted with pugmills, which are found very useful, and -when the
sugar is dried the traps at the bottom of the machines are opened
and the sugar is swept out on to a broad indiarubber belt, which,
travelling at a considerable speed, carries the sugar away to the
trays, in which it is by hand conveyed to the bagging-room.
Throughout the whole of the works there is a completeness and
finish which speaks well for the manufacturers of the machinery.
The general manager of the company’s property is Mr. J. E.
Davidson, one of the first men in the district to start the industry,
and, indeed, the first to erect a sugar mill; and in taking a look
through the property of the Melbourne-Mackay Queensland Sugar
Company we may consider that the Palms is a very satisfactory-
crowning point to the energy and enterprise which he has so
steadily and consistently exercised since he first settled in Mackay.
The firm of W. Sloane k Co., represented by Mr. R. J. Jeffray, is
largely interested in this company, and shares with Mr. Davidson
whatever credit is due to the company for the extensive develop-
ment of the sugar industry in the neighborhood of the Palms
estate.”
After spending a most pleasant day at Alexandra we left, and
on our return passed the Te Kovvai estate, another of the Mel-
bourne-Mackay Company’s properties. This plantation lies to the


north, and on the south side of the road the land is chiefly occupied
by small selectors, who grow cane and sell it to the neighboring
mills. The mill at Te Kowai can produce 1,500 tons in the season.
We also skirted the Meadowlands estate, the property of Messrs.
Hyne & Co. The area is 640 acres, hut the owners purchase
largely from the selectors. There are two mills, which are equal
to the production of 2,000 tons of sugar. On the south side of
the road, about three miles from Mackay, is the racecourse, a fine
level flat; and as an indication of the value of land in the neigh-
borhood, 66 acres of the course have recently been let on a five
years’ lease at an annual rental of £3 per acre, the lessees under-
taking to fence off the racecourse. This land is of course to be
used for the cultivation of sugar-cane.
THE COLORED LABOR QUESTION IN QUEENSLAND.
As settlement gradually took place in the tropics, the necessity
for colored labor soon became manifest. The first Polynesians
brought to Queensland were introduced in 1866, entirely by pri-
vate enterprise, and without being subject to legislation or
Government regulations. These islanders were at that time freely
obtainable on a payment of £6 per head as the cost of introduction,
and received as now an annual wage of £6. The well-known
“ Karl” massacre, and the system of kidnapping which grew up
under the uncontrolled traffic in Kanakas, aroused public attention,
and the demand for legislation was met by the passing of the
Polynesian Labor Act by the Queensland Parliament in 1868.
It is only fair to state, however, that the Queensland planters
affirm that the kidnapping and brutalities was not perpetrated by
the vessels engaged in the Queensland trade. At the same time
it is universally admitted that legislative control was necessary.
Under the above-named Act it became necessary for a Government
agent to accompany every vessel which went recruiting among the
islands. A planter requiring labor applies to the immigration
agent for a licence to introduce islanders. He must state the
number he proposes to introduce, and the estate on which they
are to be employed, accompanied by a declaration that the appli-
cant has made all necessary arrangements to employ them in
tropical agriculture. He has also to enter into a bond, with two
sureties, to the amount of £5 for each islander, to cover the


cost of his return, and in addition he must deposit 30s. per
head to defray the expenses of the immigration agent. The
planters, in fact, pay the whole of the cost of the introduction,
supervision, and return of the Kanakas ; so that there is no charge
whatever on this account against the general revenue of the
colony.
When these preliminaries have been complied with, the planter
receives a licence to recruit, and arranges for this to be done.
When the recruiting vessel is among the islands it is the duty of
the Government agent to explain to every Polynesian who offers
himself as an emigrant, the nature of the agreement into which he
has to enter, the kind of work he will be required to do, the
time he will be absent, and all particulars with which he ought
to be acquainted for him to be in every respect a willing
emigrant. Provisions in the Act regulate the number of
islanders to be carried in each vessel, and also the rations
and general arrangements on board during the voyage. On
arrival at the nearest port to the plantation for which they are
engaged, the agreements between the planters and the islanders
are signed on board the vessel before landing. All reasonable care
is taken to prevent ill-usage, and in cases where it is proved to
take place relief is afforded. Further, when such ill-usage is
detected, the Government have the power to refuse the issue of any
further licence to recruit, and this power has been exercised.
Here it may be well to repeat what has been stated earlier, that,
so far as my personal observation went, I neither saw nor heard
anything of unkind treatment. On the contrary, the Kanakas I
saw in the canefields, driving carts, in the mills, or employed
about the dwellings, impressed me with the conviction that they
were well fed, well cared for, and thoroughly happy; and as I
drove over a large portion of the Mackay district, and visited a
large number of plantations, I feel satisfied that there, at any
rate, the planters carry out a system of humane control.
In 1880 the Polynesian Laborers’ Act was repealed, and still
farther to protect the islanders the Act known as the “Pacific
Islands Laborers’ Act” was passed, in which, in addition to the
strict provisions in the previous Act, provision is made for hospitals
and other matters.
For the past six or seven years the demand for Kanakas has
been considerably greater than the available supply, and the cost
of introducing them has increased from £6 per head in 1868 to
£2O at the present time for small numbers, and £lB and £l9 for
large numbers.


To-day there are thousands of acres of sugar land which would
he put under cultivation, not only at Mackay, but in other parts of
Queensland, if only the necessary labor could be obtained; and
next year it is estimated that an additional influx of 1,500 could
be readily absorbed.
About eighteen months ago, in consequence of the short supply
of islanders, Chinese, in considerable numbers, were introduced
into the Mackay district, chiefly from the goldfields in the north.
But so far as I could gather, the planters are not favorable to the
employment of Chinese, as they are averse to the introduction of a
class of laborers which will eventually interfere with the legitimate
employment of Europeans. It will be remembered that at Home-
bush a number of Chinese are engaged for plantation work at 13s.
per week with rations. I was informed that in the event of the
present agitation against coolies being successful, the planters will
be driven to endeavor to make contracts with Chinese head-men,
and introduce extensively this class of labor.
The history of the importation of the Cingalese who have caused
so much trouble is somewhat interesting, and may be regarded as
an attempt, as a dernier ressort, on the part of the planters to show
the constituencies of Queensland that they must have colored
labor, and that if they could not obtain it with legislative sanction
and Government regulations, they would have it without. The
experiment, however, has been a blunder and a disaster. It has
intensified public antipathy; it has strengthened to some degree
the hands of the anti-coolie party; it has given great trouble to
those who have imported them ; and it has not supplied the planters
with the kind of labor they require. It is, of course, well known
that the Ceylon planters themselves do not use the inhabitants of
the island for agriculture. They import Tamils. The average
Cingalese, in fact, is a sufficiently deft handicraftsman or a house-
servant, but he is incorrigibly lazy and tricky. As it was expressed
to me by a military officer whom I met —“ The Cingalese is too
lazy to stand up to work at anything. When he does work he
wants to sit down to it.” There are, however, a certain number of
time-expired Tamils among those who have come down, and these,
if they had not been influenced by the Cingalese, would, under
new agreements, have been quite content to have kept steadily at
work.
In connection with this somewhat unfortunate attempt, it is to
be borne in mind that in 1881 the planters made strenuous efforts
to induce the Government to bring into operation, by the issue of
regulations, the Act known as the “ Coolie Act,” which was passed


as long ago as the year 1862. The Government showed their
willingness to carry out the wishes of the planters by placing on
the estimates the sum of £6OO pounds, as the salary of an immi-
grant agent. The hostility to this vote, however, was so great in
the Legislative Assembly that it had to be withdrawn. The
planters, however, finding that the Government were powerless to
help them, subscribed a sufficient sum to send an accredited agent
(Mr. O’Rafferty) to India to confer with the Indian Government
in order to ascertain the precise terms on which coolies could
be introduced into Queensland. A series of regulations was
drawn up, on almost identical lines with the Indian Immi-
gration Act passed in the last session of our Parliament, and
these were submitted to the Queensland Government. In them,
however, there was no provision made for the compulsory
return of the coolies to India at the end of their five years’
indentures, if they declined to enter into re-indentures and
wished to stop in the colony. The view of the Government
appears to have been that, in order to prevent the interference of
colored labor with the legitimate employment of Europeans, it is
necessary that the coolies should be strictly limited to agricultural
occupations, and that in every case they should, at the expiration
of their contracts, be returned to India. It would seem that the
Indian Government do not regard favorably the compulsory return
system. While the negotiations were in process the House met
in July, 1882, and the Hon. S. W. Griffiths gave notice of motion
for the repeal of the Coolie Act of 1862, which, if carried, would
have struck away the foundation on which the introduction of
coolies and the regulations for them must rest. When this
subject was under debate it was forcibly pointed out that the
planters must have colored labor, and that they could obtain it;
and if the Coolie Bill were repealed, they would be driven to
introduce colored labor of some kind without any regulations at
all, which they did not desire. The result of the debate was that
the Coolie Bill was not repealed. The Government, although
favorable, were unable to do any more than pass a Bill providing
that no regulations made under the Act of 1862 should have the
force of law until they had received the sanction of both Houses
of Parliament.
At this juncture, when the planters, who are vitally interested
in the matter of labor supply, saw that in the then state of public
feeling, both within and without the House, that the Government
would be unable to obtain the passing of regulations under the
Coolie Act, and being pressed with the necessity for additional


hands, determined to try the experiment of getting such labor as
they could, which would be uncontrolled by regulations. Mr.
Nott, of Bundaberg, received advices from Ceylon that coolies, as
he understood, could be obtained there. Several planters agreed,
under the pressing nature of the circumstances, to enage a certain
number and run the risk. It appears to have been the general
impression that as coolies could enter Ceylon, they would be able
to enter into engagements to come to Australia. No doubt it was
expected that the labor that would be imported would be Tamils.
Had it been suspec'ed that the hands were ordinary Cingalese
villagers, none of the planters would have been parties to their
introduction, as they seem to have been well aware that they were
unsuitable for, and unskilled in, agricultural work. The Devon-
shire steamer was, however, chartered by the agent in Ceylon, and
about 500 Cingalese were obtained without the least difficulty.
Among these there were some Tamils, time-expired men, and, as
before stated, these men would have quietly settled down to their
work, if (hey had not been incited to disturbance by the Cingalese.
In addition to those who were engaged, a number of stowaways got
on board, and proved a most disorderly element. In the case of
those who were regularly engaged, the agreements were completed
and signed in Ceylon by the coolies, and no difficulties were antici-
pated by the planters. The Queensland Government were not aware
of what was being done, and it was only when the Devonshire was
nearly due in Queensland waters that they were informed of the fact.
On arrival at Mackay 275 were landed for different plantations
there. They brought with them about £6OO in cash, and the
majority had obtained an advance of £2, the whole of which they
spent in the town. The agreement provided that they were to
receive £2O per year and ration themselves. The charge for im-
portation was £lB per head, and there was a provision that made
the planters who engaged them liable for the cost of their return.
The first signs of discontent was manifested in consequence of
the price of rice, which they allege they were told was cheap,
but on which in Queensland there is an import duty of Id,
per lb., which made a difference in their estimated cost of living
of Is. 2d. per week, or over 15 per cent, of their yearly wage.
They also complained that the other articles of their daily diet were
much dearer than they were led to expect. On the other hand,
it must be stated that the agent in Ceylon, in a letter recently
published in the Queenslander, affirms that all these matters were
clearly explained before the engagements were entered into.
However this may be, the fact is that soon after their arrival on


the different plantations they began to strike, and then flocked in
large numbers into the town of Mackay, chiefly from the Home-
bush estate. At the Palms, Mr. Davidson, the manager of the
Melbourne-Mackay Company’s estates, finding that there was a
misunderstanding, drew up fresh agreements, by which his com-
pany agreed to give their contingent lOd. per day and ration
them. The Colonial Sugar Company and others adopted the same
plan, and made the same offer. But, as it appears evident that
many of them are averse to work, even this liberal amendment
of the terms of their agreement did not satisfy them. They
refused to return to the plantations, and demanded to be sent back
to Ceylon. Then the position was further complicated by the
action of Sir Ralph Gore, the immigration agent, who, being
on a visit to Mackay, was interviewed by the Cingalese, and
ordered that they should be admitted into the depot, where
they were housed and provisioned at the Government expense.
Immediately on this emissaries were dispatched to the plantations
where some were at work, and a number of these then left.
When the Government were communicated with they repudiated the
action of Sir Ralph Gore, on the ground that the Government had
nothing whatever to do with the introduction of the Cingalese.
Instructions were also telegraphed to turn them out of the depot.
Resort was then made to the Local Court to test the legality of the
original agreements, from which still further confusion arose. One
bench of magistrates ruled that the agreements were legal and
binding; another held that they were not. Under one judgment
two or three Cingalese were sent to prison; of course in the other
case the accused were dismissed, and by the action of the bench
virtually relieved of their engagements altogether. Whatever may
be the issue of the present complications, it is the opinion of
pratical planters that Cingalese are unsuitable for plantation work,
and that it is highly undesirable to introduce colored labor into
Queensland except under Government regulations. At the same
time the uniform statement of those interested in the sugar industry
in that colony is—“ We must have colored labor.” They would
regard the passing of an Act on the lines of the Indian Immigration
Act as a relief from their present embarrassments in obtaining
labor, and as securing the permanent and increasing success of the
sugar industry.


THE NORTHERN TERRITORY AS A COUNTRY FOR THE
GROWTH OF SUGAR AND OTHER TROPICAL PRODUCTS ;
AND THE ADVANTAGES OF COOLIE LABOR FOR THE
NORTHERN TERRITORY.
It is not necessary, after the success which has attended the
operations of Mr. Holtze, the Government gardener, at the nursery,
Fannie Bay, to demonstrate by description or statistics the
suitability of the Northern Territory for tropical agriculture under
proper management. Mr. Holtze has shown that sugar-cane,
indigo, cotton, tapioca, rice, and other tropical products grow and
thrive. The report of Mr. W. H. Thompson to the directors of the
DeLissa Company is highly satisfactory, so far as soil and climate are
concerned, and as Mr. Thompson has had many years’ experience
in sugar growing in the West Indies, he is entitled to speak as an
expert. Very fine cane has been grown on the land of the
Palmerston Plantation Company, on the Daly river; and the
latest accounts give good ground for believing that a large extent
of suitable land exists on the banks of the Adelaide. In addition,
there is the great unexplored region which stretches up to Capo
Arnheim, where those who are most competent to form an opinion
anticipate that large areas of agricultural land will be discovered.
A party is now organised to thoroughly explore this country.
As, however, this pamphlet may come into the hands of those
not acquainted with the reports above referred to, I append their
most salient portions.
CULTIVATION IN TUB NORTHERN TERRITORY.
Mr. Maurice Holtze, of the Government garden, at Port Darwin,
contributes the following interesting information :—“ I may state
at the outset that the Fannie Bay experimental nursery, covering
thirty-two acres, was started under my management in November,
1879, and is, therefore, only about two and a half years old, so
that it may be rather premature to pronounce a decided opinion
upon the various plants which have been tried in the garden. I
think, however, that those which have thriven during the three
growing seasons without being affected by climatic influences or
disease, may fairly be said to be suited to the country; especially
when we know that the first two seasons have been unfavorable
on account of the weather being unusually dry, and that some of
the soil in the nursery is rather poor.
To simplify these notes it will be best to class the plants under
three heads, viz.:
Ist. Those proved fully suitable to the country during each of
the three past seasons.


2nd. Those which from any cause have failed during one or
other of the above seasons, but seem otherwise suitable for culti-
vation if the cause of failure be removable ; and
3rd. Those which have failed to thrive in the nursery.
Ist. Amongst the plants fully suitable I am glad to say that the
most valuable portion of those which succeed well includes sugar-
cane, indigo, tapioca, arrowroot, rice, maize, ramie, ground nut,
castor oil, sesam, and ginger.
All of these have grown in such luxuriance, and have been so
completely free from disease or vermin that I have not the slightest
hesitation in recommending their culture.
2nd. Plants having failed in one of the seasons, through any
cause, but otherwise apparently adapted to the climate of the
territory. These include cotton, jute, and tobacco, though it is
scarcely fair to put cotton in any other than the first division, as
the cause of its failure last year was due to the seed being taken
from deteriorated plants. I have since imported fresh American
seed of Upland and Sea Island varieties, and the state of their
growth this year leaves nothing better to be desired.
Jute for the first two seasons "was strong and healthy, but this
year, probably from the unusual dryness of the weather, the plants
have been attacked by borers and have been completely destroyed.
Of tobacco I had a good crop in the season of ’79-80,but ’Bl was
rather too dry to bring it to perfection, though the produce was by
no means a failure. Of the present plantation I cannot yet give
an opinion as it is yet too young. Tobacco should be grown dur-
ing the first part of the dry season, it being a sws-tropical pro-
duction, and would best thrive in the moist gullies which are so
numerous in the territory, where I believe it would flourish in great
luxuriance.
3rd. Of plants which have not thriven well in the nursery may
be mentioned coffee, cocoa, nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, pepper, tea,
vanilla, poppy; but I have not the slightest doubt that in many
parts of the country, in sheltered moist gullies, nearly all the above
might be successfully cultivated, though I would not advise any
large outlay to be incurred before a special trial.
Liberian coffee, which I received only a fesv months ago, stands
very well, but it would be too early to give a decided opinion as to
its fitness.
It must not be forgotten that our nursery is close to the sea, and
exposed to its breezes, and that while many plants are not inju-
riously affected thereby, the air and saline moisture are too strong
for other kinds.


I may here refer to another plant tried this season for the first
time, and therefore still unproved; but when 1 mention that the
seed was only put in the ground last September, and has already
made a stem over 12ft. high and Sin. through, there are grounds for
hoping that it will turn out a success. This is the Indiarubber
plant (Ceara or Mamhet glazious), seeds of which, with other
valuable products, I received from my greatly esteemed friend
Baron F. von Muller, the celebrated Victorian Government Botanist.
In the foregoing I have only referred to those plants which have
a commercial value, and are the common staple produce of tropical
countries; hut I might add that many tropical and sub-tropical
fruit trees are being tried and propagated in the nursery, most of
which are doing well —such as the mangoe, jackfruit, breadfruit,
custard apple, sweetsop, soursop, orange, citron, lemon, lime, shad-
dock, fig, peach, pomegranate, luchre, longan, bambootan, jujube,
almond, quince, granadillar, banana, plantain, pineapple, &c., as
well as a collection of fodder plants and grapes, together with
ornamental trees and shrubs in considerable variety.
Intending colonists may feel interested in vegetables as well as
in the above-enumerated productions, so I may in conclusion state
that a fair variety of tropical as well as European vegetables are
successfully grown and sold at reasonable prices by the Chinese
market gardeners.’’
The Government Resident (E. W. Price, Esq.), in his report
under date June, 1882, referring to agriculture, says :
The growth of the cane this year, which was rather backward, has been
materially assisted by the May rainfall, and the canes on the DeLissa Company
are growing vigorously, and even should the crop not realise expectation this
year, owing to the lateness of the rainy season, still there must he a splendid
crop from the ratoons next year. The crop at Bean’s plantation at the Palms
is very healthy, and there is a very thick crop. These canes were only planted
in March, and of course could not mature this year, hut there will be a fine
crop f-u nursery purposes, and the present growth proves what the land on
Cox’s Peninsula will grow. Messrs. Erickson, Cloppenhurg, Harris, and Head,
who have taken up land on the Peninsula, in small blocks, are all doing well
with sugarcane, tobacco, maize, and other produce. Their cane is splendid in
size an quality, and there is some hope of their being able to obtain a small
mill, as they are rather far away from the DeLissa Company’s mill. The
above men have been the real pioneers of tropical agriculture in the territory.
The only capital they started on was a stout heart and a strong hand. Some
samples of the cane growing on the Daly have been brought by Mr. Owston to
Palmerston ; they are quite as fine as any in the Government garden, and there
are twenty acres similar on the plantation, ready for nursery purposes this year.
The maize from the Daly is also first-class, and the cobs much larger than any
hitherto grown here. It now remains to test the land on the Adelaide for
sugar growing; and there, although the top soil is very rich, the subsoil of
clay seems to frighten intending planters. In my last report I quoted from
Dalton’s British Guiana, to show that such subsoil is good for sugar, and I now
supplement by quoting from “The Coolie,” by Mr. Jenkins, the author of
“ Ginx’s Baby,” and who was sent out at the same time as the Commission


ordered by Earl Granville, then Secretary of State for the Colonies. Mr.
Jenkins made a most minute inspection of the sugar lands in British Guiana;
and there, where the finest sugar is grown, he reports the subsoil “as like the
London blue clay. ” Another fault found with our alluvial soil on the river
banks is the excessive quantity of water, and therefore people say “it is only
fit for rice.” Now the Chinese at Mindale, one mile from Palmerston, have
been trying patches of sugarcane on some low swampy land, and the result is
fine cane, long and thick, the density of which has not yet been tried.
The Government llesident, in his report dated January, 1883,
has the following :
Plantations . —During the past year some steady work has been done in sugar-
growing and other tropical produce, but not as much as might have been done.
Mr, Bean is still in charge of the DeLissa estate, now I believed called the
Spring Yale estate. He is also in charge of the Palms, where I understand
the cane is looking well. Mr. Holtze, the Government gardener, visited Cox’s
Peninsula during the year and examined the land, and he agrees with me that
the river banks are the most suitable for sugar. The peninsula contains large
patches of rich soil, but if I had been one of those who had grants of land for
sugar growing I would have gone to the Adelaide or Daly, where the land can
be cropped for years in succession without wearing out. The Palmerston
Plantation Company are, I understand, going to hold their land and cultivate.
After the House of Assembly had negatived the proposition relative to the
shape being altered the company applied for the return of the survey fees, but
since that I believe they are going to work it. It would have been a great pity
to have seen the plantation deserted after such proof of its fitness for sugar and
maize growing. They have now a fine nursery of cane—enough to plant 200
or 300 acres next season—and Mr. Owston has received a shipment of five first-
class draught horses for ploughing and cultivating. The Rum Jungle plantation
is progressing rapidly under the able management of Mr. Poett, and the young
plants are growing vigorously, and I understand that cinchona plants are in a
flourishing condition. That company deserves success, and I have no doubt
will ensure it as soon as cheap labor can be obtained. The Chinese are not
proving themselves first-class plantation hands, as they raise their terms each
year, and their stay is uncertain, and they want a large amount of supervision
to keep them at work, and it is no use employing a mandore over them, as he
will not keep them working unless he in his turn is supervised by a European.
The planting of a nursery on the land of the Adelaide Land and Sugar Com-
pany has been completed, and the young cane, although planted late, is growing
very rapidly. The subsoil on being tinned up in large cakes, crumbled into a
rich mould within twelve hours. Mr. Holtze visited the land and saw it being
cultivated, and he states that the soil on being worked is magnificient; and as
we have millions of acres of similar land in the territory this is very cheering
news, and Mr. Holtze is a man who is slow to give an opinion unless he is
certain. I remember a gentleman who holds land on the west bank of Adelaide
river returning from visiting his land, and producing a lump of subsoil with
the remark, “Nothing could possibly grow in it.” That is the very subsoil
that Mr. Holtze now describes as crumbling into a rich mould on being culti-
vated. I must add that at the time the above remark was made it seemed
correct. Messrs. Harris, Head, Cloppenburg, and Erickson are continuing their
work in their small plantations on the peninsula with great success, and now'
have comfortable homesteads on their land. These men may fairly be called
the pioneer planters of the territory, and they have succeeded by sheer pluck
and energy, unassisted by capital. There are now about two acres of cane
planted as an experiment on Messrs. Fisher & Lyons’s land, on the west bank
of the Adelaide river. A portion of the cane first planted w r as eaten by the
rats, but they soon disappeared, and that eaten was not planted in properly
cultivated land, but the remainder is growing well considering that the land was
not ploughed, but turned up by Chinese hand labor, and no Chinaman ever uses
a spade or makes any attempt to do more than scratch the land with a long-


handled shovel, which is far from sufficient for cane. The Chinese will now
probably commence rice growing on a large scale, as some of their leading men
informed me that they were only waiting for the land to he thrown open again
to commence. Their gardens are all doing well, even in the salt swamp at
Fannie Bay, which seems utterly unfitted for agriculture. As a sign of their
work, I may state that large, fine pineapples were hawked about this season at
half-a-crown per dozen.
The directors of the DeLissa Company have published the
following statement, which contains the substance of Mr. W. H.
Thompson’s report: —
The sugar companies of South Australia represent a new industry destined to
play a very important part in the development of the Northern Territory. Up
to the present time the success of the DeLissa Company has not been equal to
their wishes, or what might reasonably have been expected by their shareholders.
The history of this company shows that something more than theoretical know-
ledge is essential to success. Since the establishment of the DeLissa, a second
company, known as the Adelaide and Port Darwin Sugar Company (Limited),
with land adjacent to the first, has been started on the Douglas Peninsula. An
overseer, hailing we believe from Demerara, was sent up immediately, and a
quantity of land cleared for a sugarcane nursery, and planted with the view to
secure the means of further and more extensive planting next season. When it
is considered that hardly any land is worth cultivating for sugar which costs
less than £5 an acre to clear, it will be seen what is involved in getting 1,000
acres under cultivation in the first instance.* About May or June last Mr. W.
H. Thompson, late manager of a sugar estate in the island of Antigua, West
Indies, being on a visit to Adelaide, the directors of the two companies thought
it a good opportunity to obtain a reliable report on the work done, the manage-
ment, and the estimated value of the respective estates, and arranged for Mr.
Thompson to visit and report, which he accordingly did. * * * *
*********** Mr. Unmnann’s
******** *** Mr. Thompson’s
report, which came to hand in September, did much to reassure the minds of
the directors and shareholders, and doubtless of the public too. He states that
the selection of the site for the two plantations is in most respects admirable,
and all that could be desired. Contrary to the experience of selectors on inland
rivers, access is easy at all seasons, chiefly by water, the land carriage being
short, and without natural obstacles, and the whole estate probably within
twenty miles of Palmerston. He points out the unsuitability of certain blocks
put under cultivation; these having been, as it seems, chosen because they
required little or no clearing, and which he advises should be applied to other
uses than cane growing. He points out the perfect suitability of other blocks,
also under cultivation, and the suitability and superior quality of much of the
adjacent land for cane culture. *******
On the DeLissa, and Adelaide and Port Darwin estates, there exists, in
freshwater creeks and springs, an apparently inexhaustible supply of the
purest quality, admirably situated for easy and cheap irrigation, so that a crop
may always be insured. The site for the sugar mill is also admirably chosen,
and much work has been done on the estate, though some of the expenditure
has been injudicious and some might have been deferred for a while. To his
eye, as a West India planter, there seemed to be much waste of one kind or
another—most of it avoidable. He recommends the employment of the steam
plough as much the most economical in the long run, especially in the absence
of cheap and abundant labor. He also advises the introduction and breeding of
mules for use on the estate as far more hardy for work, longer lived, and less
subject to disease than horses in that elimate. So satisfied is he of this, from
his West Indian experience, that he recommends the breeding of mules for sale
as well as use, as likely to form a considerable item of profit to the companies,
or to any one embarking in the enterprise, as he says they must eventually

supersede the horse and come into general use throughout the territory. As a
matter that will interest many persons outside of the two companies, Mr.
Thompson remarks that some of the best work done on the plantations, he was
informed, had been done by the Port Essington aboriginal natives, some
twenty or thirty of whom have heea occasionally employed there under the
direction of Mr. Levi, brother of the Messrs. Levi, of Port Adelaide. This
labor is cheap, and, whilst useful to the companies, must he of still greater
value to the blacks themselves as the best initiation they could have into
civilised life. Mr. Thompson’s report winds up with the following remark :
“In conclusion, I must say that I have never before had the privilege of
visiting and reporting on such a vast and rich sugar country, and with sound
and judicious management the result must ultimately prove very remunera-
tive.” This hits the nail on the head. What is wanted is “sound and
judicious management,” and it is to Queensland, where all the conditions of
labor, cultivation, and manufacture most nearly approach the Northern Terri-
tory, that the directors of both companies have turned to seek for a new
manager. By the kind and friendly aid of Mr. G. C. Craig, editor of The
Sugar Planter , a monthly journal published in Maryborough, devoted to the
sugar interest, communication has been opened with Mr. Frank Biddles, whose
•experience extends over twelve years of sugar cultivation in Queensland. He
was one season—lB72 —at the Eaton Yale factory in Queensland, and the
sugars there manufactured took the highest honors at Glasgow Exposition
same year. He served two whole seasons in the “ Good Hope” factory—the
second year as mill manager.
The latest report dated the 12th February, 1883, from the
manager of Poett’s plantation at Hum Jungle, states as follows :
Cinchona. —These require a great deal of attention to raise and grow at first,
but after they pass the first five or six months they do wonderfully well—
better than in India. Some seed planted here only eleven months ago has
given us a few plants whose growth for cinchona is splendid. I have never
seen it equalled in Ceylon. On the 30th November I marked these plants as
15in.; to-day they top a yard measure. This is a splendid growth for
cinchonas, and lam much pleased with such success. I was very sanguine of
their doing well, but they far exceed my most glowing anticipations. Of
younger cinchona plants there are fully 10,000 promising splendidly, and
probably 200,000 younger still. I never saw better prospects of the growth
being successful than I now point to on this estate.
Coffee. —There are from 150,000 to 200,000 young plants just putting out
their fourth leaves, and a prettier, more successful, or more healthy nursery I
challenge anyone to show anyvjhere.
Cotton.— There are 35 plants of this. It is the South Sea Island variety,
and grows most beautifully. I will send samples before long.
Tobacco — lndiarubber. —A small parcel of seeds of both the above have been
received and planted with due care. The latter will do well here, and I think
tobacco will also, but of this plant I have not much experience.
The prospects of the estate are most encouraging and satisfactory.
It may here be mentioned that the mean average rainfall at
Palmerston for the past thirteen years is 63*223 inches.
While, however, the Northern Territory presents a vast field
for enterprise and the investment of capital, it is, if not neces-
sary, at least desirable, to satisfy those who contemplate taking up
land for cultivation there that coolie labor is suited for the purpose.
On this point it might be sufficient to say that in the West Indies,
Demarara, Mauritius, and elsewhere they are successfully employed.
But as coolies were first introduced into Fiji only so recently as

1879, evidence that they have given satisfaction and proved remu-
nerative there will be even more weighty than any conclusions
drawn from old sugar-growing countries.
The following extracts, therefore, are given from the official
report of the Acting Agent-General to the Chief Secretary of
Fiji. In them much information is given, and those who are con-
templating tropical agriculture and the employment of coolies may
gain many useful hints on the details of management: —
Immigration Department, Fiji, December 31st, 1881.
Sir—l have the honor to report as follows, for the information of His Excel-
lency the Governor, upon the condition of the Indian immigrants since their
arrival in this colony in May, 1879.
2. In January, 1879, the immigration agent in India advised the local Govern-
ment that he had chartered the ship Leonidas, of some 1,600 tons burden, for
the conveyance of 498 Indians, including women and children, from Calcutta
to Fiji.
3. The Government therefore purchased for the purpose of an immigration
depot a small island, of about 100 acres in area, situated some eight miles from
Levuka, and about a half a mile from the Island of Ovalau (on which is built
the town of Levuka, the seat of Government), and upon it were erected houses
suitable to requirements.
4. Large wooden buildings were put up for the separate accommodation of
the single men and women, together with a hospital, storehouses, quarters for
depot keepers, dispensers, &c,, and there were also added afterwards some thirty
Fijian houses for married people.
5. The Fijian houses were constructed of reed walls and thatched roofs, and
provided with wooden bed-places, being in most respects similar to the build-
ings which compose the Indian camps on estates in the Mauritius, where I
spent some years as an inspector of police and assistant protector of immi-
grants, the second officer in the Immigration Office of that colony.
6. The Leonidas left Calcutta on the 4th March, 1879, and had on board,
besides the immigrants, a surgeon superintendent, topasses, and five inter-
preters for sendee in the colony, of whom one was a qualified dispenser.
On the loth May, 1879, the ship andved in Levuka with the first Indian
immigrants imported into the colony, after a passage of seventy-two days.
7. The number of souls who left Calcutta, according to the nominal roll,
were—Men, 273 ; women, 146; boys, 42, plus 5 infants; girls, 20, plus 12
infants. But a few days after leaving port cholera and smallpox had broken
out on b ard, and before the vessel reached her destination 17 persons suc-
cumbed-men, 6 ; women, 3 ; boys, 3; girls, 1; infants, 4.
8. On arrival the surgeon-superintendent, Dr. Welsh, informed the health
officer ot these facts, and the vessel was put in quarantine.
9. The measures taken for the housing and medical care of the immigrants
while so confined are described in the despatches of His Excellency Lieutenant-
Governor Des Yoeux (since appointed Governor), which were printed by order
of the House of Commons, September 7th, 1880, in a Parliamentary Paper, Ho.
411 ; Session 2.
17. The following births have taken place since arrival of immigrants in the
colony:

This gives a mortality for the two years four and a half months ending 31st
December, 1881, of about 28 per thousand.
19. Three men and two women purchased their exemption since arrival. One
man in the employ of the Public Works paid £9 65., and is now in Levuka.
Another in the employ of Mr. Baillie, of Serna, paid £lO 165., and went hack
to India. The third was on the Colonial Sugar Company’s estate, and purchased
his own and his wife’s exemption for £lB 125., both of them being now in
Suva. The other woman was a household servant to Mr. Berry and paid £l5,
and is now in Levuka.
20. According to the terms of Ordinance YI. of 1878, it was incumbent on
employers to feed their immigrants for twelve months. This was done by all
employers at first; but at the expiration of six months, the immigrants having
complied with paragraph XLIII. of the Ordinance, they, at their own and their
employers’ desire, supplied themselves. The immigrants are much more contented
when buying for themselves than when having the regulation ration served out
to them.
On one plantation (Rabi) they buy very little rice and a great deal of flour,
and on the other plantations they buy but little flour, and as most of the curry
stuffs grow wild in the country they have not to purchase them.
The immigrants have no complaints to make of prices. At one time, on the
Yuni Cibi Cibi estate, the rice was so bad in the shop on that estate that they
Avent to the adjoining estate, where there are likewise Indian immigrants, and
purchased there.
As the shops in this colony in the country are few and far between, the
employers of Indian immigrants have all opened shops on their plantations,
Avhere their laborers are supplied at the lowest possible price (the cost in Sydney
plus freight and insurance), and much under current rates. These shops keep
nearly everything the immigrant requires, and are for his sole use, in
one instance, where the proprietor trades for native food for his Polynesian
immigrants.
21. When the immigrants first arrived the only employer of field laborers
(Mr. Hill, Rabi Island) tried them at daywork, but found they did so little
that he substituted taskwork, which satisfied master and man much better.
This is the only estate where the boys are utilised; they collect cocoanuts
at so much per hundred, and one boy had earned as much as 13s. per month
Avhen I was there last, some two months ago. As this estate is an island by
itself, the stipendiary magistrate of the district pays an official visit there at
irregular intervals once every month. There have been no complaints on

either side from this estate since the men went there in August, 1879. The
houses are most excellent, and there is a good hospital and a resident
medical man.
As already stated, there were originally allotted to the Rabi estate-
-52 men, 25 women, 16 boys, 8 girls, and 4 infants. Of these, in two years
and four months, only 2 men, 1 woman, and 1 child have died, and 3 boys
and 10 girls have been born. The earnings on this estate have been satis-
factory.
22. The Viti estate, on the Rewa river, Yiti Levu, belonging to Mr. J. C.
Smith, under the management of Mr. Tucker, had 41 men, 19 women,
6 children, and 2 infants allotted in November, 1880. The work on this
estate is by task, and both employer and employed are well satisfied with each
other. The earnings on this estate are much more than on the other estates
on this river, as will be seen from the table attached: —

23. On the estate of J. C. Smith, the Indians were at first paid at per diem,
but have lately been paid for taskwork.
This estate likewise keeps a shop for the sole use of the Indians, and is well
supplied.


One man was drowned and three girls were born since the immigrants went
to this estate.
The houses are good and the camp large and comfortable. There is also a
good hospital, and the laborers are attended by the Government medical officer
of the district.
The manager had been some time in Ceylon, and was used to Indian immi-
grants.
24. On the adjoining estate of Yuni Cibi Cibi matters were until lately by no
means so satisfactory. The manager, when the laborers first went there, bad
never worked with Indians, and did not understand their ways or wants. He
overtasked the people, and they consequently earned insufficient wages to keep
them in health. Though he was summoned before the magistrate and fined,
his treatment did not improve, the result being that during the consideration
of a representation made by me to the owners, with a view to bring about a
change of management, the manager was set upon by the coolies and severely
beaten.
Though it was necessary to institute a prosecution for this offence, which
resulted in the men being sentenced to imprisonment—five for one year, and
five for six months—the facts elicited at the trial showed so much culpable
carelessness in the treatment of the laborers, that it became necessary to remove
all of them from the estate. Mter the lapse of some weeks, on the appointment
of a new manager, the Governor permitted their return.
There is now a good hospital, attended by the district Government medical
officer, and new houses are being erected for the Indians. They seem very con-
tented with the new management.
There have, on this estate, been two deaths, one man and a woman, and no
births.
25. The other estate employing Indian immigrants on this river is about
twenty miles from the other two, and is the property of an opulent sugar
refining company, who have the largest sugar plant in the colony.
The immigrants went to this estate on June Ist of this year. The manager of
the company in Fiji was for several years in Demarara, and the overseer in
charge of the Indians was likewise in that colony for some time.
Daywork was commenced with here, but after the first month was given up
for taskwork, owing to the small amount done. This caused great dissatisfac-
tion amongst the laborers, but they are now beginning to settle down to their
work.
There is an excellent hospital on this estate, and when the new houses—now
in course of construction —are completed, the estate will be a model one as regards
its provision for the comfort of the laborers.
The district Government medical officer attends this estate likewise.
All three estates are within easy distance. of the resident magistrate, the
Government medical officer, and the police camp.
26. The general conduct of the Indians has been fairly good, but it must be
expected that amongst so many there will be a few bad characters.
The most salient cases have been—
1. On Rabi a man clove his wife’s head with an axe. He was sentenced by
the Supreme Court to six years’ imprisonment,
2. That at Yum Cibi Cibi, above mentioned.
The other complaints are those arising on every plantation where there are
Indian immigrants, and do not call for any special remarks.
27. The Indian immigrants keep very much to themselves on plantations
where Polynesian and Fijian laborers are likewise located, and I have heard of
no disturbances between them. The Indian and Fijian mutually despise each
other.
The three estates on the Rewa are growing sugar-cane, and it is only on such
estates as these that the three nationalities come together.
On Alpha estate, Taviuni, coffee is the staple, and there are no laborers other
than Indians.
On Rabi cocoanuts only are cultivated, and the products therefrom, copra and
fibre.

28. That the immigrants have earned more money than they require for their
personal wants may be seen from the fact that five have been enabled to buy
their exemotion, and the following have banked money: -Kedarsing, £2O,
Sohundoo, £lO ; Malledeen, £35 ; Sohun, £4O; Surram, £10; Omrarsing, £2O ;
Khosial, £l5. This amount has been banked by those employed on Viti Leva
Island, and their employers state that there are many who have small sums of
£5 and upwards, which'they themselves keep.
The immigrants on Rabi and Taviuni have no means of banking, but many
of these doubtless have saved up considerably, especially on Rabi, where they
make excellent wages and have but little means of spending them.
31, There is a qualified Hindustani interpreter attached to the courts of Rewa
and Taviuni, the two magisterial districts in which ail the Indians are employed,
except those at Suva and Levuka. .
Those on the Rewa river, Viti Levu, and Alpha, Taviuni, are inspected as
often as possible by the officers of the department.
I have already stated that the Rabi estate, is inspected every month by the
stipendiary magistrate of the district.
The staff of the Immigration Department consists of—An agent-general,
sub-agent and chief clerk, accountant, clerk and Hindustani interpreter
inspector of immigrants, depot keeper, and medical officer to depot.
32. There is no doubt that this colony will, within the next few years, open a
large field for Indian immigration, as owing to the extension of industries such
as sugar and coffee, and the failure of the supply of laborers from Polynesia,
the colony must turn itself for help to India, and as an earnest of this 1,200
Indian immigrants have been applied for, for 1882.
To show the increased demand for laborers I may quote the application for
1880 as 1,660 Polynesians
1881 “ 1,860 “
1882 “ 3,237 > “
phis Indian immigrants.
The original objection to engage Indians came more from the pocket of the
planter, as in 1878, when the first requisitions went to India, Polynesian immi-
grants could be brought from their islands at a cost of £8 per adult. This cost,
however, has steadily increased owing to many causes, as in 1889 I had to offer
£lO per head, and in 1881 it was found impossible to get vessels to recruit for
£l2. and I am certain that next year it will be more than difficult to charter
vessels at £l4 or £l5.
The relative cost of the importation is about as follows :
Polynesian, three years’ engagement — £
This amount spread over five years would be £l5 per annum.
I have calculated the Indian immigrant’s wages as follows : If a man work
every day of the year at Is. per diem, he would make ss, 6d. per week, taking
out Sundays, half-days on Saturdays, and four holidays, New Year’s Day,
(hristmas Day, and two other Days for Mohorrum, he would earn £l4 3s.
A woman in the same way at 9d. per diem would make £lO 12s. od. So that,


1 think, taking the average earnings at £ll per immigrant, I have given a high
rate of wages.
There is thus hut little difference at present between the cost of both, and
there will be less still next year when the Polynesian vessels will command
higher charter money.

On the general question of the coolie system of labor, letters in
a recent issue of the Rockhampton Capricornian will tend to
correct many mistakes which are current, and to remove the pre-
judices of those who are opposed to the introduction of coolies.
Dr. Cunningham has recently arrived as surgeon in charge of the
immigrant ship Melpomene.
Bulletin Office, Rockhampton, January 7th, 1883.
Sir—Having ascertained that you have occupied the position of Protector of
Immigrants, or Inspector of Coolies, in the West Indies for about two years,
and that you have thus gained, by practical experience, intimate knowledge of,
and acquaintance with, what is called the coolie system of labor, I beg to apply
to you for information upon the subject. I must explain that I do so in the
public interests, and at the request of a number of gentlemen, employers of
labor, resident in this district. The coolie question is at present a matter of
practical politics in this colony. There is one party favorable to the introduction
of Indian coolies, under proper regulations, and for employment only in tropical
agriculture. Another party is opposed to the introduction of coolies on any
pretence whatever. Statements are made by these parties directly contradictory
of < ach other, and the result is that many persons are in a state of doubt and
uncertainty. In these circumstances, I ask you to answer the following
questions, without fear or favor, without prejudice, and as an honest, God-fearing
man:—
1. Are you aware whether the Indian coolies are trepanned or abducted from
their homes to labor in foreign countries ?
2. Are they shipped for transportation to the West Indies under regulations
providing for their proper treatment ?
3. Does their condition on the estates in the West Indies resemble that of
slaves ?
4. Can you briefly state the time they work, and the kind of work in which
they are employed ?
5. Are they allowed to be employed in any kind of work ?
6. What are the wages they receive ?
7. On the estates where they are em> loyed in the West Indies, do the coolies
mix with the white people, or live by themselves ?
8. Are the coolies satisfied and pleased with the operation of the system under
which they are employed ?
P. What is your opinion as to its moral and material influence on them ?
10. Are time-expired coolies permitted to remain in the West Indies P
11. In defiance of regulations to the contrary, have numbers of them re-
mained and mixed with the resident population ?
12. What has been the effect of the introduction of cheap colored labor on
the material prosperity of the West Indian Islands P
13. Would the introduction of coolies into Queensland be the means of re-
ducing the wages earned by white men employed as lumpers, laborers, navvies,
carters, &c. ?
14. Has the employment of coolies been the means of providing occupation
for a large number of white men in the West Indies, for whom otherwise there
would have been nothing to do ?
15. Have white men been employed in the work done by coolies.
16. Can they be got to do it ?
J7* i they ca P a^e of doing it without loss of health and vigor ?


18. Under the Imperial Act of Parliament, would it be pcrmissable to employ
coolies in saw-mills, boiling-down establishments, or factories of any kind ?
19. After the experience you have bad in the West Indies, do you think the
introduction of coolies into Queensland would be detrimental to the moral,
social, and material interests of this colony ?
20. Do you think it will be possible for colonists who have not the advan-
tage of cheap coolie labor to compete successfully with persons engaged in the
production of sugar, cocoa, &c., in the W£st Indies ?
Will you kindly favor me with such information in addition as you think may
be useful to the people of this colony. I am, Sir, Ac.,
WILL. MHLWRAITII.
To Charles Lennox Cunningham, Esq., F.S.S., M.R.C.S., &c., Rockhampton.
Rockhampton, February Bth, 1883.
Sir—l have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter from the
Bulletin office, dated Rockhampton, February 7th, 1883, and in reply thereto I
have great pleasure in replying to the questions therein, in as brief and concise
a manner as possible.
Question No. 1. Having been frequently sent from the Comnhssioner’s office
in Downing-street, London, to Calcutta, in order to select suitable as well as
reject any unsuitable persons voluntarily offering themselves as intending emi-
grants for labor in the West India colonies, as well as having made myself
thoroughly conversant with the whole system of recruiting agency, as prac-
tised according to the clearly and distinctly laid down clauses of the Indian
Laborers’ Act, I am happily in a position to emphatically deny that Indian
emigrants (or coolies as they are called), coming from that part of Her Majesty’s
dominions, are ever trepanned or aid noted from their homes to labor in foreign
countries. On the contrary a very great difficulty exi.-ts in restraining many
from emigrating whose physical stamina appears to the inspecting officer
unsuited for work in the West India Islands, but who are more than desirous of
joining their contented and very fortunate brethren in the far west.
2. They are carefully placed in depot prior to being shipped for transportation
to the West Indies in the very finest and best built vessels of the day, whilst
their well-being is guarded over by a surgeon-superintendent, invested with
more power than is ever accorded to superintendents of our colonial immigrant
ships. The medical man must be married, able to speak English, Hindustani,
and Tamil, and receives his commission direct from the Crown Agents for the
Colonies Department, Downing-street, London, whilst the general stores, medi-
cines, and medical comforts are upon a much more liberal scale than those
supplied to emigrant ships going to our own colonies from England.
3. Certainly not. They are free to come, go, and do as they like when the
labor hours are over or their daily task is finished. Earl Kimberley having
taken the whole working of the Indian coolie immigration under his especial
care and protection, will at once be an answer to any absurd question on this
head.
4. By the provisions of one of the very latest and most carefully, as well as
elaborately drawn up, Acts, that of Grenada, assented to on the 26th day of
October, 1879, the Indian laborer works, or is supposed to work, seven hours
in the field, ten hours in the briling-house or cocoa drying room. Their prin-
cipal occupation (indeed, I may add, their only occupation) is agriculture— i.e.,
preparing the land for sugar, coffee, cocoa, sp:ce, and cotton growing—after-
wards holeing, cleaning canes, cocoa pieces, and, when crop season sets in, they
cut, reap, boil, or season the same. T hey seem to like, and appear to be physi-
cally able, to do this class of work, unless it be a few ch Idren and some lazy
hands who are c. ntent to herd the cattle employed on the estate, or look after
a horse or two of the employers, but to these I was in the habit of allowing a
slight diminution in the rate of wages tendered.
6. Not generally. They are supposed to be hired for field service, and that
alone.


6. Every able-bodied man earns, or work must be supplied to enable him to
earn, at least Is. per diem; women, Bd.; children, 6d.
7. They do not mix with the white people beyond those they see or are under
on the estates. They are a peaceable, contented, sober lot, and prefer living
by themselves on the ranges or houses erected for their especial accommodation.
8. As far as my experience goes as protector on their behalf, I can at once say
they, with very few exceptions, seem . very pleased with the operation of the
well-organised system under which they are engaged, transported, and employed
a fact the few complaints registered by me against the managers of estates
amplify testifies to.
9. My opinion, as an officiating protestant minister amongst them, is the
system decidedly favors morality in their midst, as well as influences many to
become Christians. Several of my charge were married by me, many christened
—whilst a large colony of Indian coolies located in Demerara, having lately
embraced all the forms and ceremonies of Protestantism, have built a handsome
church, with scarcely any outside assistance whatever being given to them.
10. They are, if the bounty money is given at the termination of the five
years’ indenture—and they are willing to accept of it, and re-indenture them-
selves. Otherwise they must be returned to India, under the provisions of the
Emigration Act. After ten years’ indenture they are free.
11. Not to my knowledge. The faithful discharge of duties on the part of
protector would effectually check any undesirable result of this nature.
12. Yery great. To quote statistical returns from, Demerara, Jamaica,
British Guinea, Grenada, proves this beyond any doubt.
13. Not by any means, rather raise them. If there were more sugar, cocoa,
and coffee estates, more white managers, more subs., and under officials, would
be needed to carry them on.
14. Unquestionably it has. All the managers, sub-managers, and field
inspectors are, in the West Indies, European to a man, the coolies preferring the
white man superintendence to any other of his own color. If the estates were
closed, or the coolies withdrawn, hundreds of Englishmen would be at once
thrown out of occupation.
15. Yes. They have been tried, so have creoles, so have Cingalese, and all
proved miserable failures.
16. No.
17. Unquestionably not without serious risk to their lives, the work necessi-
tating constant exposure to the sun, and long standing in muddy water, or upon
a damp soil.
18. Upon this point I must beg to be allowed a reservation of opinion.
Hitherto I, as protector, have not been supplied with sufficient hands from
India to meet the demand made for more by managers and proprietors of sugar,
cocoa, and spice estates. Much less could I entertain proposals for labor assis-
tance outside those before named.
19. I conscientiously do not think so, from my experience in the West Indies
having good reason for believing otherwise.
20. No, Ido not think it possible. 1 have been repeatedly told by gentlemen
whose testimony can be relied on, that any attempt to grow sugar, cocoa, cotton,
and spices, except by properly regulated coolie, or cheap labor, will never
succeed in the long run.
In conclusion, sir, I may add that I have in my possessi >n the Indentured
Indian Immigrants Act, my own and other inspectors returns, as made to
Parliament. But being desirous of withholding for the present more minute
details concerning the operation of these, and trusting ray answers will be of
service to the agricultural interest at large,
I am, Sir, cbc.,
C. L. CUNNINGHAM.
A careful perusal of the report of the Acting Agent-General of
Fiji (Mr. Seed) and the letter of Dr. Cunningham, clearly
establishes that Indian coolies are the best and cheapest available


laborers for tropical agriculture in the Northern Territory. Mr.
Seed, in paragraph 32, points out that the cost of a Polynesian
under a three years’ engagement in Fiji is £l4 per annum, and
that the cost of an Indian coolie under a five years’ engagement is
£ls per annum; but he adds significantly that the Polynesian
vessels will command higher charter money. Indeed, the cost at
the present time of Polynesians, even if they were obtainable, is
quite equal to that of coolies.
The practical fad is this. Apart from the opportunities afforded
by the growth of rice, cotton, cocoa, coffee, tapioca, &c., the con-
sumption of sugar in South Australia this year may be set down
at 12,000 tons The actual quantity imported last year was 11,373
tons. On sugar there is an import duty of £3 per ton, but when
grown and manufactured in the Northern Territory it will enter
free. There is room therefore for twenty-four mills, each pro-
ducing 500 tons, or twelve mills producing 1,000 tons per annum,
upon which the planters and manufacturers in the Northern
Territory will be in a position of advantage to the extent of £3
per ton over fcreign growers. According to the experience of
planters in Queensland it requires an expenditure of £4O per ton
on the milling capacity to produce merchantable sugar. There is
room, therefore, for the investment of £lBO,OOO in the sugar in-
dustry in the Northern Territory to supply the consumers of South
Australia alone. The average total cost of all the sugar grown and
manufactured in the Mackay district, laid down on the wharf at
Mackay, is estimated at £l4 per ton. The margin of profit there-
fore is sufficiently obvious. The percentage of profit, of course,
will depend upon the care and skill of the planters, and the quality
of the sugar manufactured. These facts, in addition to the advan-
tages offered by the Indian Immigration Hill, should stimulate those
who have the capital and enterprise to prosecute the sugar industry
with promptitude and vigor in the Northern Territory.
