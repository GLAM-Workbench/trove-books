COMMEMORATING
DEPARTURE Of,TflE N.5.W. CONTINGENT
January 17th, 1900.
Once more Australia's gallant sons bid native land adieu,
We'll fight and conquer side by side the old world and the new—
■'V
We'll hand in hand for Britain's cause united take our stand,
And prove as our forefathers did we love our motherland.
For is it not the same old flag, our father's flag and ours,
J hat floats unfettered in the breeze tjespite all foreign powers ;
Beneath the dear old Union Jack with England- we'll unite,
And show the world Australia's sons are not afraid to fight.
CHORDS—
'Tis a grand example, Australia feels the pride,
To think her sons in Britain's cause are fighting side by side ;
No foreign foes appal us,' each danger we will share,
When England need a helping hands, Australia will be there.
None can dispute that British pluck, where ere the flags unfurled,
Has stamped Britannia's gallant sons the bravest in the world
Remember Balaclava's charge and famous Waterloo,
Such Bright examples serve to show what British pluck can do.
And plainly now we demonstrate on every hand to-day,
That be the odds what e're it might they never fear the fray :
Beneath the dear old Union Jack, with England we'll unite
And show the world Australia's sons are not afraid to fight.
