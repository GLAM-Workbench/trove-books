Sir CHARLES NICHOLSON, Bart:

In responding to the request that I should read a paper,
before the members of the Society of Arts, on ? The Aus-
tralian Colonies, their Condition, Resources, and Pros-
pects,? I am quite conscious that I have to deal with a
subject wiiich, from its exclusively practical bearings, is
rather calculated to awaken useful reflection than merely
to interest and amuse for the moment those to whom it is
addressed. If, however, I can succeed for a brief interval
in enlisting your sympathies on subjects meriting attention
from their intrinsic importance, whilst destitute of all
novelty, I shall achieve all I can hope for on the present
occasion.
The history of modern colonisation is essentially a
prosaic one. It presents few of the wild and romantic
incidents that characterise the adventures of those who at
the end of the fifteenth and during the sixteenth century,
first reached America or penetrated to the far East. The
men who in the present day are engaged in the work of
seeking for and occupying lands hitherto unknown and
untenanted, for the most part secure only a languid and
ephemeral interest on the part of the public in their la-
bours, although their efforts may be really productive of
far more important results, as affecting human happiness
and the actual destinies of mankind, than the achieve-
ments of men with whose names and exploits the Old
World is familiar.
The founding of an empire, however silent and un-
ostentatious the process may be, is, in point of fact, a much
more heroic work than the mere guidance of a state or
the successful command of an army. The results of the
one last for all time, and may affect the happiness of un-
born millions, ?the action of the other is necessarily tem-
porary and circumscribed. The scenes, the life, and the
occupation that await the man who emigrates to a new
and distant land are in the first instance, and from a par-
tial survey, far from exhilirating. He has to fix his lot
in a spot?it may be at the extremity of the globe?where
all the appliances of civilised life have to be created, if
they have not already been called into partial existence by
those who have just preceded him. The first colonist
may find himself placed on the shores of a distant bay
indenting some wild coast, on the banks of a stream draw-
ing its sources from unknown regions (furnishing him with
the first and greatest of all nature?s gifts in a new country,
? water?), or on the verge of a pathless forest, tenanted by
savage men and animals. People who live in old com-
munities, such as those of Europe, little know how much
they are indebted to the 2000 years of civilisation that
have passed before them?in the subjugation of nature, the
clearance of forests, the drainage of land, the construction
of cities, roads, bridges, churches, colleges, all the in-
numerable appliances of a high and progressive civilisa
tion, the creation of successive ages, and the fruit of unin-
terrupted labour extending through centuries. All these,
and everything appertaining to civilised life, the colonist
| has to build up and provide for himself. And yet it is
marvellous how much man, when influenced by a reso-
lute will, is enabled to achieve in supplying all that can
minister, not only to his absolute needs, but to his com-
fort and his luxuries. Let a stranger disembark at some
one of the larger metropolitan towns of Australia, and he
will be amazed at the maturity they exhibit, at the broad
and well-paved streets, the handsome edifices, public and
private, that everywhere meet his eye. He will be hardly
able to persuade himself that much?in some examples
(as that of Melbourne), the whole of this?is the creation
of a period less than that of a single generation. He will
learn with pride how much has been done in so brief an
interval by the indomitable energy of his countrymen,
and he wiH not repine at the reflection that his lot has
been cast in a period and amongst a race by whom so
much has been attempted and so much accomplished.
To an association like that of the Society of Arts, so en-
lightened and yet so practical in all its views, the pheno-
mena and the fruits of Australian colonisation can hardly
be regarded as wanting in scientific value or economic in-
terest ; for whilst the great settlements of the Southern
hemisphere are calculated to afford happy and independent
homes for ages yet to come to the surplus population of
the British Islands, they in the meantime constitute the
great source for the supply of the raw material upon the
manipulation of which so many thousands of the opera-
tive classes here depend. The staple product of the
colonies, wool, is an article the creation of which is not
dependent upon a forced and unnatural state of things,
like that of the slave states of America, which may be
destroyed or arrested in a single moment, from causes over
which this country and the British government have no
control. The vast plains of Australia, and the innu-
merable flocks of sheep that are depastured on them, must
continue to supply uninterruptedly one of the prime ar-
ticles of civilised life, in the production of wool, for ages
to come. A race of purely British origin, with tastes,
prepossessions, and habits purely British, will long conti-
nue to form the chief customers for those articles which
are the products of English industry. Take, for example,
the youngest of all the colonies, Queensland, ?the annual
rate of consumption of British manufactured goods, for
every man, woman, and child, is over �2O a head; whilst
throughout America the ratio is, I believe, only some 19s.
a head. The raising and the transport of the raw mate-
rials of commerce from one end of the world to the other,
the conversion of these to such forms as adapt them to
the requirements of man, and their redistribution over the
civilised world, is a process involving the activity, the
capital, and the skill of persons engaged in almost every
variety of industrial occupation?the farmer, the gra/ier,
the ship-builder, the sailor, the weaver?, the engineer.
When Napoleon said that the great elements of national
prosperity were ships, colonies, and commerce, he might,


with equal emphasis, have said simply, ? colonies;? for ported. The cessation of this outlet led to the establish-
the establishment, the growth, the intercourse between ment of the penal colony of New South Wales. On the
them and the parent state necessarily presuppose ship-
ping and trade. These are views the truth of which I
may safely assume are fully acquiesced in by such an au-
dience as that which I have now the honour to address,
and I will therefore, without further preface, proceed
with what I propose as the main subject of this evening?s
paper.
It would be wearisome, and not very profitable, were I
to enter into a dry narrative of the history of colonisation,
or present you with long arrays of statistics, all of which
you can get from books, and very few of which you
would probably recollect after leaving this room. My aim
therefore will be rather to tell you what the colonies are,
to communicate some general idea of their physical
character and capabilities, theirsocial and economic aspects,
the prospects they hold out to settlers, and finally to give
you, as far as I can, opinions founded upon personal expe-
rience and observation in connection with these several
heads.
You are all familiar with the great outlines of the Aus-
tralian continent, and the islands adjacent including New
Zealand, as delineated in the maps of the southern
hemisphere. The existence of these great southern lands
was first obscurely made known to Europe about the end
of the sixteenth or beginning of the seventeenth century.
It was not until Cook, in his second voyage, had explored
the whole of the eastern coast?to which he gave the
name of New South Wales?that any correct idea was ob-
tained of the geographical extent or peculiar productions
of New Holland. There are perhaps few men of whom
England may be more justly proud than of this illustrious
navigator. Cook was accompanied by two eminent
naturalists, Banks and Solander. The partial observations
and collections which they were enabled to make, revealed
to them the existence of what might almost be considered
a new world. They discovered animals and plants, dif-
fering from those hitherto known, and presenting few
affinities with the Fauna or Flora of the old world or of
America. So isolated, so peculiar, and characteristic did
these appear to be, that the wildest speculations were in-
dulged in to account for the phenomenon. Blumenbach
explained the existence of those exceptional forms of
plants and animals by the strange supposition that our
planet must have been brought, on some occasion or other,
into collision with some comet or great sidereal body, and
that the latter had left a portion of its contents impressed
on the southern side of our globe. Without reference to
such a vague hypothesis, the fact appeared to be estab-
lished, that in the great antipodean region, which it was
suggested should be called the fifth quarter or division of
the earth, there seemed to exist as it were a special crea-
tion of plants and animals curiously fashioned after a type
that separated them from the rest of the world. The in-
terest excited by these discoveries was chiefly of a scien-
tific and speculative kind. No practical effort was made
to turn the discoveries of Cook to account until after
the conclusion of the American war, when the British
government, no longer able to transport its criminals
to North America, was under the necessity of pro-
viding some other spot, under its own jurisdiction, for
the reception of those convicted of offences against the
law. It is customary amongst American historians to
ignore the fact that, for probably a full century before they
acquired their political independence, the 13 provinces
had to all intents and purposes been the penal settlements
of the British empire. The criminal records of England
show this; and it is only necessary to refer to a volume of
the Annual Register, or to the Gentleman's Magazine of
the middle of the last century, to see that deportation to
the British plantations of America was the ordinary
punishment for all such of the graver offences as, under
the sanguinary code that then prevailed, were not
visited with death. Virginia and the Southern States
were those to which convicts were for the most part trans-
18th, 19th, and 20th of January, 1788, nearly 76 years
ago, the first Europeans, destined to become the permanent
occupants of the country, landed at Botany Bay. They
consisted of 850 prisoners of both sexes; of a military
guard, a portion of which were accompanied by their
wives and families; and the necessary civil establishment
of a governor and staff. A more forlorn and desolate
scene can scarcely be imagined than that presented by this
first band of wayworn travellers on their reaching the
shores of that savage and then all but unknown land.
The party may be said to have consisted simply of pri-
soners and their jailers. Many of the former had, almost
unwillingly, exchanged death itself for the terrors of ex-
patriation to a distant and inhospitable wilderness, from
which no hope of return to the land that had cast them
forth could ever be anticipated. Between seven and eight
months had elapsed in the tedious voyage, and disease
had thinned their ranks. Let us pause for a moment, and
contemplate the condition of Australia on the 20th of
January, 1788, and on the anniversary of that day in 1862.
A group of men, women, and children are seen scattered
and encamped on the shores of a wide bay, hemmed in by
the margin of a sombre and dense forest. Despair, re-
pentance, hope must alternately have agitated the breasts
of many seated, on that eventful day, on that lonely
strand. In 75 short years, within the lifetime and memory
of many still amonst us, what do we see? The 1,100
people have grown into a community of 1,300,000 souls.
The weary voyage, which then occupied seven or eight
months, can now be accomplished in as many weeks.
The morass surrounding the shores of Botany Bay, on
the margin of which for a few days they first encamped, is
now within the sound and sight of a splendid city, mus-
tering one hundred thousand inhabitants, and containing
within its precincts many of the attributes of a rich and
luxurious capital. The smoke and the rattle of steam
carriages and locomotives are seen and heard on that spot,
the silence and the solitude of which had been unbroken
since the first dawn of creation, save by the war-cry or
the song of the aboriginal native. It is a singular fact
that the first portion of land cleared from the indigenous
timber, and I believe the first spot on which a plough
entered the soil, was identically that selected 60 years
afterwards as the site of a magnificent pile of buildings for
the first university es T er established in Australia. It seems
a striking and a happy coincidence, that the supply of the
material element for the sustenance of the physical body,
should thus become the antetype of that higher provision
for the intellectual wants and moral requirements of the
race that was so soon to follow.
The first aspect presented by the unknown land on the
coast of which they then found themselves was forbidding.
Sir Joseph Banks, in his report, had spoken of smiling and
luxuriant meadows as skirting the shores of Botany Bay.
These turned out, on examination, to be a mere swamp,
covered with low and useless but beautifully flowering
shrubs. The adjacent country consisted of stony, sterile
ridges, or dense and sombre forests of the Eucalyptus,
After a few days the first encampment was abandoned,
and on the 26th of January, which is celebrated as the
birthday of the colony, the whole settlement was trans-
ferred to a point about six miles further to the north, to
the shores of Port Jackson, where Sydney now stands.
I will not detain you with a narrative of the trials and
vicissitudes which the young community had to undergo ;
the harsh and occasionally capricious, but, upon the whole,
judicious policy which was applied to the government of
the prisoner population ; the gradual and progressive ex-
ploration and occupation of the coast and of the interior
country. For a considerable period the knowledge ac-
quired by the settlers of the latter did not extend far from
their principal encampment, and was confined to a radius
of a few miles from what is now the site of the city of
Sydney. The Paver Hunter and its tributaries were then


explored, and their rich alluvial banks gradually taken up in a marvellous ratio. In 1818, just sixty years from the

the westward were arrested by a range of mountains extend-
ing along the whole of the eastern side of Australia, from
Cape York to Gipps Land, and it was not till 1813 that this
great banner was surmounted, and the interior plains be-
yond them discovered. They were named ? the Bathurst
plains.? The sources of rivers flowing to the west and
south were here, for the first time, fallen in with, and
were designated as the ? Lachlan ? and the ? Macquarie.?
They were traced for several hundred miles to the west,
and were found connecting themselves with other streams
flowing from the north. In endeavouring to extend his
exploration, Lieut. Oxley, the Surveyor-General, found
the whole country under water, and he returned with the
impression of there being a great central lake or inland
sea, an opinion which prevailed for many years, until the
rivers were finally traced to their junction with the Mor-
rumbidgee and the Murray, large streams, coming from
eastern and south-eastern portions of the territory. The
great system of rivers prevailing in Eastern Australia was
finally followed out and made known through the re-
searches of Messrs. Hovell and Hume, Captain Sturt, Sir
Thomas Mitchell, and ethers. A large and magnificent
tract of country, that of Port Phillip, was opened in 1836,
by Governor Sir Richard Bourke, and subsequently, in
1850, erected into a separate dependency of the British
crown, under the name of ? Victoria.? About the same
period (1836) South Australia was established, and, after a
short and struggling infancy, soon became a flourishing
settlement. Van Dieman?s Land, originally an offshoot
from New South Wales, had been placed under the ad-
ministration of a separate government as early as 1824.
Western Australia, established in 1829, has been the least
progressive of all the Australian settlements. It possesses
but one good harbour; the soil is barren, unproductive,
and badly watered. Its chief advantages will probably be
found to consist in its mineral riches. It is at present a
penal settlement. The proposal to perpetuate the con-
vict character, and augment the number of convicts trans-
ported from the United Kingdom to this part of the
world, has created feelings of great indignation on the part
of the inhabitants of the free settlements, and given rise to
very strong remonstrances on the subject. It is felt, and
the conviction is universal, that on the completion of their
sentences nearly the whole of those who have been trans-
ported to Western Australia will find their way to the
neighbouring colonies ; that it is neither just to the latter
nor to the free settlers who may hereafter resort to them,
that they should receive the refuse criminal population of
Britain. It is demonstrable that there will be a fixed re-
lation between the number of convict expires, who, on
the completion of their sentences, will leave Western
Australia for the eastern settlements, and of those who
may be sent there from Europe. The high wages, the
temptations afforded by a fertile territory over a barren
and unproductive one, the desire to obliterate the recol-
lections of a former career, will all tend irresistibly to
produce this migration. There is a positive and universal
creased to 11,660,819, and of horned cattle to 1,752,832.
The export of wool, which in 1807 had only been 2451b5.
in weight, had in 40 years increased to 22,969,711 lbs., of
the declared export value of �1,240,144 sterling. This
may be regarded as the product of a few score pure
merino sheep that had, in anticipation of their suitability
to the Australian climate, been introduced into the colony
by an enterprising and far-seeing colonist, the late John
Macarthur, Esq. When, therefore, South Australia and
Port Phillip were constituted, the one as an independent
colony, the other as a mere extension of New South
Wales, all that the promoters and actual pioneers of these
places had to do was the comparatively easy task of pur-
chasing and driving away from the older settlements the
cattle and sheep wherewith to stock their runs. There
is a disposition to ignore this filiation?this dependency
of the newer colonies, and their derivation from the more
ancient one. The relationship nevertheless exists. It
was one in its origin mutually beneficial to all parties,
and readily accounts for the rapid growth and early ma-
turity of Victoria and South Australia, the former of
which became politically independent of New South
Wales in 1850. The last subdivision of the great Aus-
tralian territory was made by the severance, from the do-
minion of New South Wales of the vast territory now
designated Queensland, and which comprises an area as
large as that of two or three of the largest European states.
This, the youngest dependency of the British crown, has
taken a start in colonisation that justifies the anticipation
that she will soon rival, if not surpass, in her onward
p ? ogress, all the other Australian colonies.
You will perhaps, however, be impatient that I should
give you some specific details of the aspect, the character,
the capabilities, of this great group of settlements formed
by our own Anglo-Saxon brothers in the great south land,
and may desire to learn what the specialities of each
may be with reference to the question of emigration from
these shores. I will endeavour to meet such an inquiry
by presenting to you a few general observations on the
physical geography of the countries we are talking about.
These will serve to suggest some remarks on their econo-
mic capabilities. And,lastly, I shall add a few observations
on the social condition of the colonies, their future pros-
pects, and advantages as fields for European settlers.
If you will cast your eye on the map against the wall
you will recognise the great island (if it may be so called)
of New Holland, occupying a large space on the southern
side of the world. Its greatest diameter from east to
west is about 2,600 miles ; from north to south (including
the island of Tasmania) about 2,450 miles. The east coast
reaches from Cape York, in latitude 11� S. to about 43�
S. Eastern Australia may thus be said to possess a range
of climate as great as and not dissimilar from that found in
a zone the northern limit of which would be Central
France, and the southern the Cape Verd Islands. In
absolute length the eastern side of Australia is nearly as
long as the western side of Europe?that is from Cape
determination on the part of all the free
Australian '? North to Cape St,
;. Vincent. In mentioning this fact you
settlements to resist the evil here complained of, and it is
to be hoped that the Imperial Government will so mould
its policy as not needlessly to provoke a feeling of hos-
tility and determined resistance on almost the only single
question in which any possible difference can arise be-
tween England and her southern dependencies. ]
New South Wales may justly be considered, if not as
the actual parent of, yet as intimately connected with,
the origination of all the Australian settlements. Half a
century had not elapsed from her foundation when we find
her in possession of a population of somewhere about
80,000 souls. Agriculture, grazing, and pastoral pursuits
had occupied the chief attention of the early settlers. The
labour of the convicts had been usefully applied in public
works, in the clearance and enclosure of lands, and in the
tending of sheep and cattle. These latter had increased
will at once recognise how varied the climate,
how diversified the productions of this great country
must be, in which you have continuous regions with a
gradual transition from the temperature and climate of
Northern Africa to that of Devonshire or Central
France. All the products of the Old World are, accord-
ingly, capable of being produced in the corresponding
parallel of the region we are describing. In intertropical
Australia cotton, sugar, rice, and all the ordinary fruits,
and vegetable productions of India, tropical Africa and
America may readily be raised. In the regions immedi-
ately to the south, and with the climate of Morocco and
Spain?the plantain, vine, orange, pomegranate, and a
great variety of fruits indigenous to China, thrive luxu-
riantly, whilst still farther to the south, wheat and all
the cereals of Central Europe find appropriate habitats.


Few portions of the earth may perhaps be said to be more These are partially submerged during a portion of the
favourably situated. Balanced, as it were, on the tropic year, when the river becomes swollen by the melting of
,of Capricorn, the lesser and northern half lies within the
.torrid, the southern and larger section within the temper-
ate zone. Although stretching 11 degrees within the
tropic, the climate is tempered by the insular character of
the and, so far as experience hitherto goes, Tropical
Australia is most healthy. Malarious fevers, and the
diseases peculiar to tropical climates are unknown. The
summer heats along the coast are mitigated by the sea
breeze and the trade wind. On the table land of the in-
terior, the solar heat is often great, indeed excessive. It
has the peculiarity, however, of being dry, presenting in
this quality a striking contrast to the oppressive heat of
India, and it is never sufficiently great to prevent exercise
in the open air during the hottest seasons.
Physical Geography. ?So far as the configuration of
its surface has been ascertained, Australia may be said to
consist of a large plain, somewhat depressed in its centre,
and surrounded by ranges of mountains and hills of mode-
rate elevation. The largest and best known of the moun-
tain ranges is that of the eastern cordillera, the Blue
Mountains, which attains its highest altitude (about
8,000 feet) in Gipps Land, and extends from Cape York,
in the north, to Cape Howe, in the south, a distance of
some 2,000 miles. A few spurs are detached from this
great eastern barrier, the ordinary elevation of which does
not in general exceed 5,000 feet. For the most part the
great eastern cordillera springs from a base about 60
miles from the coast line. The great difficulty with all
the early settlers was to surmount this lofty rampart,
shutting them out as it were from the interior. When
once they had gained its summit, they found themselves
On an immense plateau gradually sinking towards the
west. The descent is, however, so gradual that the rivers
that flow along it are sluggish, and their progress often
imperceptible. Frequently they are mere long lagoons,
only flowing in continuous streams after heavy floods.
Occasionally these plains are broken by isolated hills, or
mountain masses. Generally the physiognomy of the
interior is one unbroken, undulating plain, sometimes of
open grassy downs, at others of lightly-timbered forest,
and occasionally of dense copses of thick impenetrable
scrub. The scenery is generally tame, and wearisomely
monotonous, although patches occasionally present them-
selves of great sylvan beauty, that carry the memoiy back
to the woodlands and meadow's of England. Substitute
grass for heather, and the wolds of Yorkshire, the downs
of Wiltshire and Sussex, would, with a bright sun, give
you a perfect idea of nine-tenths of the interior plains and
sheep runs of Australia. On the eastern side of the dividing
range the scenery is much bolder. Waterfalls, dense
forests, deep and rocky glens there prevail. The climate
is less salubrious, although proximity to the sea coast
renders the acquisition of land in such positions an object
of importance to those engaged in agricultural pursuits.
The configuration of mountain chains, in all parts of the
world, determines the system and course of rivers. Look-
ing at Eastern Australia, you perceive two great sys-
tems of waters, that on the east and that on the west
of the great backbone of the country. All the streams
on the western acclivity find their way to the south by the
Murray, and those on the north by a number of streams flow-
ing into the Gulf of Carpentaria. The Murray, with its af-
fluents, drains an enormous area. Its embouchure is at Lake
Alexandria, and, unluckily, a bar of sand separates this
salt-water basin from the sea, so that vessels, except
occasionally, and such as are of small draft, are unable to
cross over it. There is, however, an extensive system of
inland navigation now carried on on the Murray, the
Darling, and the Morrumbidgee rivers. Steamers traverse
these streams, and, at certain seasons of the year, reach
points on their banks many hundreds of miles from the
principal estuary. The country through which the great
southern system of rivers finds its way to the ocean con-
sists of immense, and to the eye boundless, alluvial flats.
the snow on the Alpine ranges of Gipps Land (from
whence the southern affluents take their course), and
by the rains of the vernal equinox. The sudden rising
occasioned by the latter is often productive of disastrous
consequences. Some of the rivers, as the Morrumbidgee,
are known to have risen as much as 100 feet in a single
night, and to have suddenly swept away whole villages
with their inhabitants. Such catastrophes are generally
the result of want of foresight on the part of the govern-
ment, and may be guarded against by a more judicious
selection of the sites reserved for townships.
On the eastern side of the Blue Mountain ranges the
rivers are shorter in length and more rapid in their course
to the sea than those on the opposite or western side.
Unfortunately, scarcely any of the rivers of Eastern Aus-
tralia are accessible from the ocean by large vessels, owing
to the existence of bars at their entrance. One of the
largest and most important of the rivers of Eastern Aus-
tralia is the Fitz�oy, which empties its waters into
Keppel Bay, in lat. 23 deg. 30m. S. Owing to a local
depression in the coast range at this particular point, the
Fitz�oy drains a larger tract of country (one the area of
which is not less than that of all England and Wales) ?
than any other of the Eastern waters. It is navigable for
vessels drawing from 12 to 14 feet of water, to a point 50
miles from its mouth, and in the greater part of its course
it flows through one of the most fertile and promising re-
gions hitherto opened up in this part of the world.
Having thus cursorily glanced at the general configu-
ration, the rivers, and the climate, I may add a few de-
tails respecting the geology) of Australia and its mineral
resources, these latter having acquired an importance
within the last few years beyond those of any other region
of the earth, with the single exception of California.
Within 10 years the produce of gold from Victoria alone
has probably not been less than 100 millions sterling; in-
cluding that from New South Wales, the aggregate
quantity is probably not very far from 125 millions ster-
ling. Copper mines have also been worked very largely
in South Australia, whilst iron and coal are found in al-
most unlimited quantities. The great central axis, ex-
tending, as I have pointed out, through a belt of 30 degrees,
consists of a series of rocks, most of which would, in the
language of British geologists, be included under the de-
signation of ?primitive,? ?silurian,? ?early metamor-
phic,? and ? early carboniferous.? There are, perhaps,
scarcely any recognisable deposits of an age intermediate
between the latter (the carboniferous) and the newest ter-
tiary deposits, many of which contain fossil remains ana-
logous to and identical with those still living on the same
spot. The distinctive peculiarity of the greater number of
the Australian mammalia is that the female is furnished with
a pouch or bag, in which she carries her young. This ano-
malous organisation seems to have prevailed almost to the
exclusion of any other, and to have been so persistent and
universal, that in all the fossil mammalia discovered in Aus-
tralia the same type is found; and as in England and other
parts of the world, the remains of extinct species of animals,
often of gigantic proportions, are found entombed in the
soil on which they once lived, so in Australia we find in
the newer tertiary deposits the bones of extinct animals of
colossal proportions. One of these, named the Diprotodon
by Professor Owen, by whom it has been described, must
have been as large as the Indian elephant. It has, how-
ever, the peculiarity common to other known Australian
mammals of being a marsupial. As many of those whom I
am now addressing are aware, the remains of animals of
the same organic type are found in a fossil state in Eng-
land, where they seem to have preceded and ushered in
higher forms of the mammalian order. These remains
are chiefly found in the Oxford slate, and there is, I
believe, no question as to their real character, their
physiological affinity with the living forms now found
in New Holland. A curious and unavoidable inference


seems to follow. The marsupial animals of England and in the older settlements you may travel for hundreds
have longl since perished, having been succeeded by of miles without meeting with a single native black, and
other and higher forms of mammals. No similar pro- that in districts where, within a few years, they existed in
gression has marked the living organisms of Australia;
and we probably see still perpetuated there animals bear-
ing the closest affinity with those that inhabited the centre
of England countless ages ago, before the great chalk de-
posits and all the great superincumbent tertiary strata had
been formed. Another example of a living analogue of
an extinct European form is presented in the Cestracion
Philippi, or Port Jackson shark; whilst many of the
living species of the vegetable kingdom?such as the
Cycadecc and Araucaricc ?appear to be survivors of a
flora that prevailed in Europe during the period of the
formation of the coal deposits and the rocks succeeding
them.
The central nucleus of the great dividing range is gra-
nite, resting upon which are gneiss, mica slate, clay slate
crystalline limestone, and quartzose rocks. These are
frequently found broken up and disturbed by the intrusion
of porphyritic and trap rocks. It is in such positions that
gold is generally to be found. The attrition of the rocks
containing the precious metal appears to have gone on
during a countless lapse of ages, the gold always occupy-
ing the lowest level, from its superior gravity, in the
mingled detritus in which it is discovered. It is in this
condition that it is most easily found and worked. The
thickness of the alluvium beneath which the auriferous
treasure lies is sometimes enormous, often as much as 300
or 400 feet. In some instances, layers of what appear to
be volcanic tufa have to be passed through, showing that
volcanoes have been in a state of activity at periods subse
quent to that in which the precious metal acquired its
present relative position. The foci from whence these
volcanic products have been derived, is still traceable in
numerous conical hills, mi the summits of which
ancient craters are discernible. The rule laid down
by Sir Roderick Murchison respecting the ?constants?
of gold, are, I believe, thoroughly verified by colonial
experience?that is, the juxtaposition of early crystalline,
quartzose and metamorphic deposits, with trappean and
porphyritic rocks. The diggings in Australia are un-
questionably exhausting all the alluvial gold, and science
and capital are now being systematically directed to the
extraction of the ore from its original matrix, or native
site in quartz veins, from the disintegration of which all
alluvial gold must, at some time or other, have originally
been derived. Silver mines have recently been worked to
some extent, and afford a promise of yielding a profitable
return. The ore is found under conditions similar to
those presented by auriferous veins. Copper ore has been
found in some favoured spots, yielding larger profits,
perhaps, than any operations connected with gold. The
Burra Burra mine is a striking example of this. The
quantity of ore at first yielded was, I believe, so large,
that for a considerable time all the original shareholders
received back the full amount of their paid-up capital
every six weeks. Advices have lately reached England
that copper mines promising to rival in richness Burra
Burra have recently been opened out at Peak Downs, in
Central Queensland.
Of all the mineral resources of the colonies, the most
valuable perhaps is coal. The auriferous region is skirted
at the east and north-east by a coal basin, the largest dia-
meter of which is probably not less than 600 miles, oc-
cupying an area as large as that of Great Britain. In the
possession of this great coal-field New South Wales en-
joys a special advantage over all the other colonies.
To complete the hasty outline, I may add a few re-
marks on the aboriginal natives and the indigenous fauna
of Australia. The former present perhaps one of the
lowest types of humanity to be anywhere found. Their
numbers are small, and they are rapidly becoming extinct.
Of the aborigines of Tasmania, four only were known to
be living three years since. In the colony of Victoria,
?when the last census was taken, their number was 1760,
that in districts where, within a few years, they existed in
great numbers, and were often troublesome to the European
invaders of their soil. At the present moment they are only
found in numerous tribes in Queensland, and in regions yet
unoccupied by the white man. On the first contact of the
two races resistance is shown to the intruder, and oc-
casionally painful outrages are perpetrated by the blacks,
bringing down speedy, and, too often, indiscriminate re-
taliation upon the offending tribes. I regret to add ray
conviction that it is an utterly hopeless task to seek to
effect any real amelioration in the material or moral con-
dition of this degraded race. They appear unsusceptible
of all permanent civilising influences, and are, indeed, so
rapidly dying out that little opportunity is afforded of at-
tempting their reclamation to the habits of civilised life.
They are, however, often found to be possessed of kindly
instincts, and manifest strong attachments to particular
individuals amongst the Europeans. In intellect they
are never more than children, and the true and most
humane policy with respect to them is always to regard
them as such.
The native animals are not numerous. The largest is
the kangaroo, a timid and graceful creature. The larger
species is rapidly disappearing from the neighbourhood of
the settlements, as is also the emu. Of the gay-plumaged
birds and curious insects of Australia, illustrative specimens
are to be seen in nearly all large museums. The only
noxious or troublesome animals are the snakes, the bite
of some one or two of which is dangerous.
The geographical position and mineralogical character
of every country must necessarily determine the nature of
its products. Of the mineral resources of the great Aus-
tralian continent I have already spoken. The immense
interior plains, like the steppes of Asia or pampas of
America, must for ages continue to be occupied as the
grazing ground of flocks of sheep and herds of cattle,
whilst the more broken and hilly or mountainous country,
near the sea-board, will be the site of towns and cities and
aggregations of people devoted to various handicraft and
industrial pursuits. The vegetable productions present all
the variety belonging to the great range of climate that
these colonies possess. I have seen growing on the banks of
the Fitz�oy river, with a luxuriance that cannot be surpassed,
various species of cotton, the sugar-cane, the tea and coffee
plants, tobacco, arrowroot, different varieties of the Ficus or
india-rubber-bearing trees; in short, all the productions
of tropical or semi-tropical zones. A little further to the
south, in the parallel of Sydney, the grape, orange, melon,
peach, and various kinds of Chinese and South American
fruits, such as the leechee and the cheramoya, abound ;
whilst in the more elevated table-lands of New South
Wales, in Victoria, and in Van Dieman?s Land, all the
English cereals, fruits, and culinary vegetables attain a
growth and a prolific power never surpassed in Europe.
Of the indigenous timber and building materials the
extent is practically unlimited. Some of the varieties of
Eucalyptus attain colossal proportions. In the deep
gorges of Tasmania trees from 280 to 300 feet high have
frequently been hewn down. The timber of many of the
trees is as compact and as durable as that of the Indian
teak. The blue gum and iron bark have already been
extensively employed in colonial shipbuilding, and might
doubtlessly form a valuable substitute for English oak in
the British dockyards. They have, to some extent, be-
come an article of export.
Various kinds of freestone and marble, some of the
latter of highly ornamental description, abound in various
quarters along the great eastern and southern ranges. The
former has been employed very generally in the public
buildings and domestic architecture of the cities and
towns. Timber and bark are the materials out of which
the squatter?s hut and the dwellings of the agriculturists
are chiefly constructed. Some of the buildings erected
in Sydney and Melbourne might vie with those of the

The principal exports, those upon which the Australians
depend, are gold, to a limited extent silver and antimony,
copper, the latter being chiefly derived from South Aus-
tralia, and coal. Iron ore, which exists in unlimited
quantities, associated with coal, is at the present moment
valueless from the cost of labour necessarily incurred in
its reduction. Wool, hides, tallow, bark used for tan-
ning, copper, and coal, constitute with the precious metal
the great exports of the Australian colonies. Amongst
products that may be hereafter raised and in relation to
which the most sanguine expectations are formed, maybe
mentioned cotton. The plant itself grows with amazing
rapidity, and from the absence of frosts in the northern
parts of Queensland becomes perennial.
Sugar, of which there is an immense consumption, will
probably ere long be raised by colonial enterprise. The
difficulty attending the development of every new species
of industry in these young and thriving communities
arises from the insufficiency and high price of labour.
With the command of this, there seems scarcely any limit
to the extent or variety of objects they are capable of pro-
ducing. With a scanty population and highly remu-
nerated labour, that species of industry is most largely
followed in which the product is large, having relation to
the cost of production. Thus the labour of one man will
on the average suffice for taking care of 1,000 sheep oc-
cupying an area of eight or ten square miles, and he may
have intrusted to his charge property worth a thousand
pounds sterling, and yielding a large annual exportable
product. I mention this as illustrating the reason why
the primary and main object of industry in these new
lands is one the aim of which is to evoke the natural ca-
pabilities of the soil, and render them available in the
conversion of the indigenous grasses into wool, mutton,
beef, tallow, and hides. The extended application of labour
to the various processes of agriculture succeeds the noma-
dic pursuits of the first settler, and in the older colonies,
especially in Van Dieman?s Land and South Australia,
large quantities of cereal produce are raised annually.
In any sketch of the Australian colonies, however rapid
and imperfect it may be, it is necessary to say something
respecting climate and vital statistics. Health and lon-
gevity are, of course, influenced by geographical position ;
and in a country where you have every variety of climate,
from that of Africa to that of France, different degrees of
salubrity will doubtless be found to characterise different
parallels in that extended area. In the portions of the
country in which population has established itself it has
been almost uniformly found that all the conditions are
favourable to health, prolonged life, and increase of births.
By the last statistical return of New South Wales, the
following results are established: ?
The comparison is, in all respects, favourable to the
colony, the marriages being more numerous in proportion
to the number of inhabitants, the birth-rate higher and
the death-rate lower, than in England, Scotland, or
France. France gives 26, Great Britain 34, births to each
thousand, while New South Wales gives 42. In France
the mortality is nearly 27 per thousand, in England 22,
in New South Wales* 17�. Of 100,000 persons living in
the respective countries, there are married in the colony
in a year 184 more than in England, 237 more than in
France, 497 more than in Scotland. To the same num-
ber living there are 792 births in New South Wales more
than in Great Britain, and 1568 more than in France;
while the rate of mortality is below that of Scotland by
of France by 1042.
The fertility attending marriages is a remarkable fea-
ture in these returns, and I collect, from the same source
from which the foregoing quotation was made, the follow-
ing particulars:?
Proportion of Births to 1000 Women living at the
age 15-45.
The proportional number of births in England is 149;
that is to say, every thousand females living at the mater-
nal age in England give birth in a year to 149 children,
while the same number in New South Wales give birth
to 204, a difference in favour of the colony of 55 children.
In Queensland the annual death rate is said to be as low
as 15.7 per thousand of the inhabitants. It must be con-
sidered, however, that in all these calculations the circum-
stances under which they are found are exceptional- A
large portion of the inhabitants of every new colony has
only become resident in it at adult age, having passed
the period of infancy and not arrived at that old age when
causes affecting life and health are most powerful and
most fatal.
I have thus endeavoured to give you in the broadest and
most general outlines, the sketch of a country in which
you are all interested, because it is your property and the
property of your countrymen, the people of the British
empire. With respect to one of these dependencies, the
only condition annexed to the enjoyment of a share in the
great national domain is, that you should, at your own
cost, find your way to and become an inhabitant of it. In
the other colonies the acquisition of land is scarcely less
facile. Now if any one were told, for the first time, that
he could, by crossing the British channel, acquire, either
as an absolute gift, or at little more than a nominal cost,
a landed estate in a country possessing almost every mate-
rial advantage in the way of climate and natural re-
sources, but where instead of meeting with foreigners, he
could encounter none but those with whose habits he was
familiar, and where he would still preserve the glorious
privilege of being a British subject, he would surely hail
such an opportunity as one greatly to be prized and re-
solutely seized upon by many in these over-peopled and
naiTow islands of Britain. The realisation of such a pro-
mise may be virtually accomplished by a short extension
of the journey. A new world awaits those who are willing
to encounter the task of seeking and taking possession
of it, I should be very unwilling to induce any one
to adopt a hasty or ill-timed view of his actual po-
sition in the old country, or to tempt_ him, by anything
I may say T , to exchange his present lot in life for a distant
and untried one in the colonies. All 1 desire to do is
simply to place before him and you facts, and the opinions
which I have been enabled to form from an extended
personal experience in the matters to which 1 have refer-
red. lam anxious, moreover, not to be misunderstood.
I have spoken of the great, I may say, unlimited capabi-
lities of Australia, of the facilities it affords for every man
acquiring?what all men covet?a piece of this solid globe
as a possession for himself and as an inheritance for his
children. Notwithstanding all this, eventual success
must be regulated, and can only be achieved by certain
classes and by those possessing certain qualifications.
Reverting to the idea of how great the privilege would
be considered of acquiring an estate as an absolute gift, or
at a merely nominal cost, a moment?s reflection would con-
vince us that such a possession would be worthless without
hands to cultivate, people to occupy, and others to con-
sume that which the land was capable of yielding. Now,
the great want of the colonies is labour; land only
acquires value as people gather upon or near it. A
man without capital, therefore, often does much better


by selling his labour to another than by employing set of his career, to work hard, to live under a bark hut,
it on his own account and on his own property. Land is to ride not unfrequently some fifty miles m a single day,
cheap in consequence of its great abundance. Labour
is dear in consequence of its scarcity. The man therefore
who sells his labour and his skill to another, is enabled to
accumulate his savings to realise a certain capital where-
with to acquire and improve land of his own, and to hire
the services of others in its improvement. The demand
for labour in the colonies is constant, unceasing, and I may
say ever augmenting. Every labourer, every artisan, may
in the course of a very brief period become an employer
of the labour of others. It is, however, labour specially
adapted to the requirements of a new society. For those
who can occupy themselves in agricultural and grazing
pursuits the demand is practically unlimited ; for those
conversant with various handicrafts, such as carpenters,
masons, bricklayers, blacksmiths, wheelrights, the demand
is always greater than the supply. As a general rule, I
would say that the Australian colonies present special at-
tractions'to three classes, the agriculturalist, the rough
mechanic, and the capitalist. As a field for those who
have been bred to professional callings, mercantile clerks,
and small tradesmen, the inducements are questionable.
The reputation of the colonies has been damaged by the
fact that classes unsuited by education and previous cal-
ling have gone out to them in too great numbers. I believe
that eventually a promising field is open to every man
willing in some degree to mould himself to the require-
ments of the society in which he lives and with which he
casts his lot. I need hardly tell you how many are at-
tracted by the gold fields. I would advise no one to yield
to this temptation. Gold seeking is to a certain, nay, to
a considerable extent, gambling. The average earnings
of such as are engaged in the pursuit are not good, not so
good as of those employed in many other branches of
industry. The occupation of gold digging everywhere
is laborious. None but such as are capable of doing
the work of English navvies, are fitted to engage
in it. When first the rush to the gold fields
took place at Port Philip in 1853, thousands already
comfortably settled, of all classes, forsook their ordinary
employment, and created a complete bouleversemenl
throughout the whole framework of colonial society. The
services of mechanics and household servants could only
be obtained at preposterous rates. A carpenter or mason
would receive �2 or �2 10s. a day. A cabman once de-
manded from me �5 for driving a distance under a mile.
The ? boots? of an inn was said to be in the receipt of
�1,200 a year for salary and gratuities, whilst nearly all
the most indispensable necessaries of life, lodging and
food, could only be commanded at the most exorbitant
rates. The madness, the confusion, and the misery of
this state of things was augmented by the daily arrival of
hundreds of fresh emigrants from other parts of the world,
The wretchedness and disappointment that many of these
endured were unspeakable, and a state of society was
temporarily exhibited such as, I believe, was never before
witnessed in any part of the world in any age. Young
men from the universities, lawyers, physicians, clergymen,
those engaged in the lighter occupations of commerce,
landed in shoals on the beach at Melbourne. There were
not sufficient dwellings to afford them shelter, and some
eight or ten thousand persons, many of them women and
children, were at one time encamped in the neighbourhood
of the city. The small stock of money and provisions
with which the adventurers were furn shed became ex-
hausted, and thousands were obliged to accept of temporary
employment, at 10s. a day, on the public roads to escape
starvation. All this has happily passed away, and the
people who now seek their way to the colonies are
such as are generally suited to its requirements. To
the young man who has some capital, who is endowed
with some degree of enterprise, and who is capable of
a certain amount of self-denial, the occupation of sheep
farming has much to recommend it. The squatter has,
however, many trials. He must be prepared, in the out-
to sleep occasionally under a gum tree, with the covering
of a mere blanket; to be contented with tea and damper
and mutton-chops as his ordinary fare; to be so placed
that he may only get hold of a newspaper once a week or
once a month; ?all these, and many other disagreeable
privations and hardships, he must be prepared to submit
to. Yet, withal, the life is not without redeeming fea-
tures. The sky and the air are, for the most part, bright,
genial, and exhilirating. If the squatter can keep out of
his merchants? and bankers? books ?if he possess a good
run?he knows that a few years? exertions will give him
independence, if not affluence. The occupation in which
he is engaged is healthful and invigorating, and a satis-
faction springs up in the consciousness of how easy it is,
after all, to give up many of the conventional luxuries
deemed indispensable in old and highly artificial states of
society. To many of the younger sons and members of
the middle and upper classes?to whom the overcrowded
professions of England offer but a slender prospect of suc-
cess?who may possess some small patrimony, a mere
temptation to idle mediocrity, insufficient to maintain
them in the social status in which they have been edu-
cated, the colonies of the South offer, I think, special
attractions. A moderate capital, steadiness, patience,
and common prudence, are all that are needed under such
circumstances to secure success. To an intermediate
class?one of agriculturists with smaller means, but
able to command the co-operative labour of families,
another kind of industry has recently been opened up.
The growth of cotton is now looked forward to as likely
to be a profitable investment of both labour and capital.
So great is the anxiety to encourage its cultivation, in both
New South Wales and Queensland, that the government
of each of these colonies respectively engages to give a
large bounty at the rate of lOd. a lb. on Sea Island,
and half that amount on the common kinds of cotton, that
may be raised for export within a given period. The first
consignment that reached England a few weeks ago netted
2s. 6d. a lb., which, with the bounty of lOd. a lb., will
yield to the producer a rate equal to 3s. 4d. a lb. Other
inducements, in the shape of free grants of laud, are also
held out, with the view of stimulating the same enter-
prise. There can be no question that the Australian
colonies are capable of producing this great staple to
any extent, provided they can command the requisite
amount of labour. Human intelligence, human hands,
are all that are needed to develop the boundless resources
?some still latent, others ready to be seized upon and
turned to profitable account?in these magnificent terri-
tories. They have already created an export, the
annual value of which, five years ago, was estimated
at �21,297,303, whilst they import and consume articles,
chiefly of British manufacture, of the estimated annual
value of �25,406,882. All this has been done?this
wondrous development of industry, power, and means
of material happiness to a large portion of mankind?
effected within a space of time so brief that the
whole phenomena may have been witnessed by thou-
sands now living. When so much has been effected
in so short a period, what may we not anticipate for the
future ? It is difficult to see any material obstacle to the
onward progress, the unlimited expansion of the Anglo-
Saxon race in the Southern hemisphere. I will not dwell
upon the political organisation of the colonies beypnd say-
ing that they possess, each and all of them, constitutional
franchises such as would, I believe, satisfy the more ad-
vanced school of politicians in England. If there be, in
these vigorous societies, some drawbacks ?an absence of
some few of the amenities that belong to certain phases of
life in older countries ?the want of these is more than
compensated for by the heartiness, the rough hospitality,
the mutual sympathy, that characterise the relations and
the intercourse of all classes. No one is exempt from the
stimulus of active, useful exertion of some sort or other,


no one is shut out from the privileges, the hopes, and the this quality could be produced. The moment an attempt
rewards of honest industry.
DISCUSSION.
Mr. John Cbawfdkd, responding to the invitation of the
Chairman, said he had listened to an eloquent and in-
structive paper, very lucid, and full of valuable informa-
tion. Australia had many advantages, and owed a great
deal to the energy of its own people, but it owed a great
deal more to this country. It had peculiar advantages
over most of our other colonies, and also some disadvan-
tages. For its extent it contained more desert land, per-
haps, than any of the other colonies, but it also contained
an abundance of good land, and its climate was excellent.
Another advantage was, that it had a very wretched abori-
ginal population, which had never offered any obstruction
to our colonization. Let them look at the difference be-
tween it and the neighbouring country?a country, per-
haps, in many respects superior to it?New Zealand. We
were now engaged in another war with the people there,
and he believed nothing short of the complete extermi-
nation of the native population would satisfy the necessi-
ties of colonization. He was sorry for it, but it could not be
helped. He remembered having a conversation with the
Governor, Sir George Grey, on this subject some years
ago, and he stated to him his opinion that fifty years
hence not one of the Maori race would exist, to which the
reply of Sir George was, ?lam sorry to be obliged to
agree with you in that opinion.? They had shown them-
selves a race superior to all other aborigines. They had
met us in the open field ; they had adopted our improve-
ments, which was not the case with the savages of
America or the South Seas, and their determined resist-
ance would lead to their destruction sooner probably than
any other of the same class of people. There was an-
other advantage which Australia had; it was the only
colony England had formed during the last 250 years
which was peculiarly adapted to the growth of wool. Wool
had done a vast deal for Australia, but gold had done for it
even more. He gathered from the reading of the paper that
�125,000,000 of gold had been produced, and what im-
mense good that gold had done ! He remembered that
some statesmen in this country endeavoured to conceal
the fact of the gold discoveries in Australia altogether,
and they did keep it to themselves for several years.
Tire knowledge of the existence of gold in Australia was
locked up at the Colonial Office for a considerable time.
It was thought that it would be detrimental to the colony,
but it proved the reverse. It had not only been useful to
the colonists on the spot, but to the whole world, and,
according to his view, gold had suffered no depreciation
whatever, because it had been the stimulus which
had produced goods equal in value to itself. He
bcheved that, before the gold discoveries, there were
> uly about 400,000 inhabitants in Australia, hut
ihese had been multiplied threefold, chiefly, he
thought, through the influence of this very gold. He
would now say a few words on the subject of cotton, which
was almost the only point on which he ventured to differ
from. Sir Charles Nicholson. He (Mr. Crawfurd) was of
opinion that Australia could never enter into competition
in the growth of cotton with the valley of the Mississippi
and other parts of America, and would never be the great
source of the supply of that material to this country. Sir
Charles Nicholson had stated that the cotton sent home
from Australia was worth 2s. and 2s. 6d. per pound. That
was at present prices, 200 per cent, higher than the ordi-
nary rate. W hen they were obliged to sell it at fid. or
Bd. per lb., he ventured to say Australia would not send a
pound of cotton to this country.
_ Sir Chaeli s Nicholson said the price he had men-
tioned was for Sea Island cotton.
Mr, Ceawfued continued.?Sea Island cotton, as they
all knewq w as a very small affair in proportion to the great
consumption of this country; it was only on the sea coast that
was made to grow it ten miles in the interior it ceased to
be Sea Island, and from being worth Is. 6d. would per-
haps not be worth more than 6d, ?the normal price of
cotton in this country. Then again as to sugar, he did
not believe that that would be successful; and with regard
to a trade both in sugar and cotton, it should be remem-
bered that Australia was 15,000 miles distant from this
country?five times as far as the valley of the Mississippi:
besides which, it had not the same internal communication,
nor the same fertility of land. Australia was too distant,
and it had not the necessary labour. There was another
point on which, if it were introduced into the discussion,
he would like to say a few words?viz., the connection of
this country with Australia?a question on which Sir
Charles Nicholson and himself differed. It was an im-
portant matter how long this connection was to last. He
would, however, say nothing upon this point at present.
Mr. T. Mackay, having been called upon by the
Chairman, said he most heartily joined in the encomium
which Mr. Crawfurd had passed upon this admirable
paper. His own associations with the colony were almost
entirely of a mercantile character. He was unacquainted
with its agricultural, pastoral, and mineral resources. He
had the opportunity of visiting Australia a few years ago,
and he never felt so proud of being an Englishman as on
the day on which he landed on the shores of Melbourne,
to find that magnificent city raised in the course of seventy
years, and furnishing all that the most luxurious taste
could wish. With regard to the mineral resources of
Australia, more especially of Victoria, with which he was
best acquainted, great disappointment, he believed,
had been experienced, owing to the uncertainty of
labour, and the unsettled state of the mining popula-
tion, owing to the influence of the gold discoveries. With
regard to coal a great change was now taking place,
and he looked forward to the coal field of New South
Wales as likely to be one of the most valuable of the re-
sources of the colony, particularly as supplying fuel to the
steamers of the Eastern Archipelago, which were now so
rapidly increasing. It must be a great consolation, after
the paper lately read by Sir Wm. Armstrong at New-
castle, to find out that when the fuel of Old England was
exhausted, we should have an abundant supply remaining
in our own colonies.
Mr. S. Sidney congratulated the Society upon the
opening of the present session with a paper by a gentle-
man so well qualified to address them. All present might
not be aware that Sir Charles Nicholson had long been
resident in Australia, and that he had twice occupied the
position of Speaker of the Colonial Assembly, first in the
Representative Assembly of New South Wales, and sub-
sequently he was appointed by her Majesty?s Government
to inaugurate the establishment of representative insti-
tutions in Queensland, where he also presided over the
Assembly. That circumstance gave additional weight to
a most excellent paper. He confessed, interested as he
had been by the paper generally, there w r ere some points
on which he could not help concurring with Mr. Crawfurd.
There could not be a question that it was to convicts, to
wool, and to gold that Australia ow 7 ed its great pros-
perity, The convicts took off the first rough edge of
colonisation, and with respect to wool nothing more need
be said. As to gold, he remembered being in this room
when the first paper was read upon the gold discoveries
in Australia, and at that time every one who had any
thought of emigrating made up his mind to go to this
colony. He also remembered stating, on that occasion,
that intending emigrants to the gold regions would be
able to see a specimen of the work they would have to
engage in by inspecting the operations then going on in
the laying down of gas-pipes in the Strand, and from that
they would see what they would have to do in Australia;
but he could not say that his remarks produced much
effect, for the gambling spirit was largely prevalent among
all classes of the community. That people should have


gone out to Australia had been greatly to our advantage, for cotton from Queensland was the finest that had tver been
he remembered the time when it was almost necessary to received into Great Britain?that however much they
force a man to emigrate, whereas the attraction of the could produce of that quality, there would always be a
gold discoveries had quite altered this state of things. No
doubt what Australia wanted most was labour; but he
did not think people required much incitement to
emigration in the present day. He remembered the time
when large crowds of working people flocked to hear a
lecture upon emigration; but at the present time there
was scarcely a village in England in which there were
not some inhabitants who had relatives doing well in
Australia, and who, through the post-office, communi-
cated their prosperous condition to their friends at home.
He would not sit down without alluding for a moment to
a movement in emigration which was due to a lady, who
had not been so successful in her plans as they could have
wished, Mrs. Chisholm. That lady suggested two things
which promoted emigration more than anything else ?one
was the land system, holding out the temptation of an allot-
ment of land when the emigrant arrived ; the other the
system of assisted emigration, by means of which people
paying a certain sum were able to send out their relatives
by receiving a contribution from Government ?a plan
which he believed had operated veiy beneficially. Mr.
Sidney also referred to the efforts made by Miss Rye in
promoting female emigration to our colonies, and ex-
pressed his opinion that no organisation for sending out
large bodies of females would be successful. The only
satisfactory plan, he believed, was that of family colo-
nization. If the colonies had their own way no
doubt they would wish to have only the young and
vigorous portions of the community sent out, but
if they had the young they must be content to
receive the middle-aged and the old relations of those
who went out. Emigration was no doubt an excellent thing
for those who had large capital lor the employment of
labour at high rates ; and a good thing also for those who
had labour to dispose of at high wages; but with regard to
the middle class, who had only a small capital to invest,
emigration should be undertaken with care and consider-
ation, and not without having some friend who could give
them good advice upon their landing. Having been him-
self engaged for many years in promoting emigration, he
confessed that the results with regard to persons with
small means had been rather of an unsatisfactory character.
There was one point worthy of notice to which Sir Charles
Nicholson had referred with great personal modesty, but
it was one in which this country took great pride. He re-
ferred to the University established in Australia, in the
foundation of which he believed Sir Charles Nicholson
was mainly instrumental. It was most gratifying to
find that in this distant locality, where great fortunes had
been made, and where general commercial prosperity pre-
vailed, literature, science, and the arts had not been neg-
lected.
Mr. Jordan (Government Emigration Agent for Queens-
land), having been called upon by the Chairman, after
speaking of the great merits of the paper, said he fully
concurred in the views of Sir Charles Nicholson on the
subject of the growth of cotton; indeed, he believed he
went further in his confidence as to the capabilities of
Australia, especially Queensland, for the production of
this material, not only the Sea Island but also the more
ordinary qualities. Mr. Cheetham, the chairman
of the Manchester Cotton Supply Association, had
told him that if the Sea Island cotton could be produced
at a somewhat less price?the price having been 2s.
per lb. before the American war?if it could be pro-
duced at Is. fid. per lb., the consumption of that particular
description would be doubled in twelve months. Even
supposing for a moment they did not grow the Orleans
cotton, and confined themselves to the Sea Island, that
quality could be produced with a large profit at Is. fid.
per lb., and the probability was that a large quantity of
that cotton would be sent to the British market. Mr. Baz-
ley had stated that, without exception, the Sea Island
market for it at an average of Is. 4d. to Is. fid. per lb. Mr.
Crawfurd had suggested that if they left the sea coast they
could no longer produce Sea Island cotton. That was true ;
but there was no reason for leaving the sea coast, as they
had 1,300 miles of it, which, along its whole extent, was per-
forated by beautiful bays, the outlets of fine navigable
rivers?short, but wide, and adapted for the purposes of
commerce. The whole extent of land required to pro-
duce the 800 million lbs. of cotton sent to this country
from the Southern States of America was only two million
acres, and if the number of people who emigrated in one
year could be sent exclusively to Queensland, and induced
to engage in cotton growing, they would be sufficient to
cultivate the two million acres which would supply all the
cotton that was consumed by the looms in Lancashire.
The growing of cotton in Queensland had not been taken
up by the great manufacturers and statesmen of England.
It had a territory twelve times the size of England and
Wales put together, and yet it had only 52,000 inha-
bitants ; but he was happy to say that, with the assistance
of Mr. Mackay, who had just addressed them, about
10.000 persons were now annually sent to that one colony
alone, and the Queensland Government had created such
facilities for the development of the great cotton capa-
bilities of that colony, that he was surprised that the
10.000 was not 100,000, and that, instead of six or seven
cotton companies (who were growing cotton successfully,
and realising such profits, that even at ordinary prices, sup-
posing the American war were to terminate to-morrow,
they would still be able to cultivate profitably), there
were not sixty or seventy such companies. Let them
look at the inducements held out for this enterprise
The government of Queensland said, ? You shall have
the land for nothing. We will give you 18 acres for
every man, woman, and child you bring out, and we will
give you a bonus of Bd. per lb. upon all the cotton you
grow as well.? That cotton was now selling at 4s. per
lb. They did not, however, base their calculations upon
such a price as that, but upon ordinary commercial prices.
If emigration went on, as it no doubt would, they would
get labour at reasonable rates, and he believed, in ten or
twenty years at most, they might with the greatest ease
send from Queensland alone all the raw material of cot-
ton that was required in this country. The distance it
had to be brought was no difficulty whatever. Mr.
Mackay had stated that be could bring cotton from
Queensland at the same price as from New Orleans.
There were so many large ships going out to this colony
with merchandise and emigrants, that they had to wait
for return freights, and they sent the ships to India and
China to procure them; consequently cotton could be
brought from Queensland at the same rates for freight as
it could from New Orleans.
Mr. Edward Hamilton, being called upon by the
Chairman, said he believed all the facts stated in the re-
markable paper read by Sir Charles Nicholson would be
admitted and were not open to controversy, and the dis-
cussion had arisen for the most part upon some observa-
tions which had fallen from his friend Mr. Crawfurd,
calling in question the possibility of the profitable growth
of cotton in any part of Australia otherwise than under
the present exceptional state of things. He thought
the answer given to Mr. Crawfurd?s criticism by Mr.
Jordan would be accepted as complete and satisfactory,
for he showed not only that there was an almost
unlimited district for the growth of Sea Island cotton,
but that even if the war in America were over, the
mere fact of the greater distance the cotton had to be
brought would not prevent it from coming into successful
competition with that grown in the Southern States of
America. He would refer to the observations in the way
of caution to emigrants which fell from Mr. Sidney. He
thought the advice thus given, unless it were to a certain


extent qualified, waa calculated to do mischief. No doubt
young men, who in this country came under the category
of ? Ne?er-do-weels? were not likely to succeed much bet-
ter in Australia, and he found in his own experience (and
he was constantly beiug referred to by one friend or
another who wished to send some young relative to
the colony) that the persons they wished to send
out were those whom their friends could not manage
in this country. That was treating the colony un-
fairly ; if they wanted a colony to do well they should
send out the best members of society and not the worst.
The temptations, no doubt, were great, and often produced
the most serious evils. He had seen people reared as
gentlemen in this country employed in breaking stones
and cutting wood ; but they were persons who probably
would not have done well in any part of the world, and
the disorders of the mind and character could not be cured
by the mere transplanting into another country. He
thought that explanation was necessary to guard against
the effect of the observations of Mr. Sidney, who seemed
to ground his remarks upon some amount of experience.
Moreover, in choosing a colony for emigration, it was
important to ascertain its special characteristics. He
regarded New Zealand as being suited for the middle and
yeoman class, and the other Australian colonies for the
upper and lower classes; and he thought that, without
exception, there was no finer field for emigrants of all
classes than was to be found in these colonies. With refe-
rence to the occupations in these colonies, they were of the
most varied character. Those who had the thews and
sinews of navvies might go to the gold fields ; those in-
clined to follow a more sedentary life would engage in
pastoral pursuits ; and he knew from his own experience
that a man employed as a shepherd could not only live
in comfort, but was also able to lay by a considerable sum
of money, and at the end of a few years become possessor
of a farm and flocks of sheep. The ?able paper of Sir
Charles Nicholson, together with the observations of
Mr. Jordan, had so fully exhausted the subject, that he
felt he could not profitably add any further remarks.
Mr. P. L. Simmonds, while coinciding in the opinions
advanced by the previous speakers as to the value of the
paper which had been read, thought that there were one
or two broad facts which might be put forward more pro-
minently in the interest of the colonies. Sir Charles
Nicholson hadjrad to deal generally and superficially with
the subject, in order to bring it within the usual limit of
time. Hence, in treating of six important colonies (even
setting aside New Zealand), it was impossible to do
more than speak in the most general terms. Observing
several Australian colonists present, he had hesitated
to rise, under the hope that they would have been dis-
posed to speak on the subject with a larger amount
of practical knowledge than he necessarily possessed.
Sir Charles had given them some of the salient facts
calculated to show the remarkable strides which the
Australian colonies had made, but his figures were rather
understated, and scarcely did fair justice to Australia at
the present time. The total amount of the estimated trade
of those colonies was given by him at about 46| millions
for five years ago, but the trade now was certainly five or
six millions above this, looking at the great advance in
wool, and the higher prices obtained. In going somewhat
closely into the calculations a year or two ago, he found
that for the year 1860 the total value of the imports was,
in round numbers, �28,000,000, and of the exports
�22,000,000, making a total trade of 60 millions. In
the last five years even the quantity of wool we had
received direct from Australia had risen from 50
million pounds to nearly 73 million 'pounds. In
1861, the value of the direct imports into the United
Kingdom from Australia was �7,000,000, besides gold to
nearly the same amount; and last year the merchandise
and British manufactures we sent there was to
the value of �12,000,000. Now that the great island
continent had been traversed from east to west and from
north to south, and that the nature of the interior was
better understood, its general progress was becoming more
rapid. The grazing ground was found to be most exten-
sive. There was no lack of water. The river system waa
better understood, and the domestic animals were increas-
ing so rapidly, that already they were reaching fast
towards the numbers possessed by the old country. Of
sheep, they now owned about twenty-five millions; of
cattle, four and a half millions; and of horses, five millions;
while recently the camel, the alpaca, the Angora goat,
and other domestic animals had been introduced, and
many of the song birds and game animals of England.
To speak much in detail of the products of Australia
would be unnecessary, with the recollection fresh in the
minds of those present of the magnificent display made
by the Australian colonies at the International Exhibition
?a display so varied that it not only surprised foreigners,
and the Secretary of State for the Colonies, but might
well be pointed to with pride by the people of this coun-
try. The rich mineral products, the timber and wood
trophies, were unsurpassed. And last, but not least, Aus-
tralia demonstrated its wonderful agricultural and horti-
cultural capabilities in grain, which carried off the palm
for weight and beauty against all competitors; and in
models of fruits and vegetables equal to any produced in
Eumpe. Australia, with the steady agricultural progress
making in South Australia, Victoria, and Tasmania, bid
fair soon to be self-supporting, instead of having, as formerly,
to import flour and wheat from Chili or America. The
wheat and maize of Australia commanded general admi-
ration among agriculturists. Sugar had been spoken of as
a future food staple of Australia, and there was no reason
why Queensland, which was in about the same latitude as
Natal, should not rival it in producing sugar ; it was only
a few years ago that Natal entered into the production,
and now about 5,000 tons were made there annually.
With the extension of coal production in Australia, ad-
ditional progress would be made in external and internal
communication and manufactures. Two million tons had
already been produced in the New South Wales collieries
in the past ten years, and the collieries there were capable
of producing and shipping 20,000 tons weekly. Mr. Jordan
had told them what was doing in emigration in Queens-
land, and he believed assisted emigration was also being
promoted now to Victoria and to New Zealand. In the
last quarter of a century, 750,000 souls had left our shores
for Australia. About ten years ago the great tide of
emigration used to set across the Atlantic, and about
250,000 persons left British ports annually for America;
now not one-fifth of that number went, and it was satis-
factory to find that at least half the emigrants from the
United Kingdom now go to Australia.
The Chairman, in closing the discussion, said, with
reference to the remark of the last speaker, that Sir Chas.
Nicholson had understated the advance made by this
colony, it could not be regarded as a fault in the paper, but
it might have been a grave objection if this had been
overstated. Some very important facts had been laid
before them, but to his mind, there was none more inter-
esting than the allusion to the first produce of 240 lbs. of
wool from the little flock of Sir Edward Macarthur, who
was, he was happy to say, now present, and had lived
to see the total exports of that material from the
colony amount to no less than sixty million lbs.
per annum. It was a most gratifying circumstance,
looking at the commercial aspects of the case, to find
that the imports of British manufactures into this
colony amounted to no less than �2O per head of the
population, whilst those into the American States
amounted to only 19s. per head. This exhibited an
amount of trade with the colony which was highly bene-
ficial to our manufactures. Another gratifying fact
was the great abundance of good timber, and also that
sugar-growing, to which Mr. Crawfurd took exception,
was Icing carried on to a considerable extent. It waa
true that both the timber and the sugar would have to be


brought a distance of 15,000 miles, but with regard
to the latter commodity, a large amount of it was
brought to this country from Bengal, a distance by
the Cape of 12,000 miles. He apprehended that
the vast extent of sea coast stated by Mr. Jordan
to be available for cotton culture, would greatly modify
the views which Mr. Crawfurd entertained as to
the practicability of the profitable growth of cotton in
these colonies; whilst the bounty of Bd. per lb., offered
by the local government of Queensland, would in itself
be a great incentive to the increased production of that
article. The realisation of man?s natural desire to possess
land was not difficult in this colony ; a man with habits
of industry was almost sure to work himself into inde-
pendence in a short space of time. Allusion had very
properly been made to the intimate connection of Sir
Charles Nicholson with the foundation of the University
of Sydney, and to the modesty of that gentleman in
speaking of that interesting circumstance. A few
days since he was accidentally reading an account of the
proceedings which took place at the opening of that Uni-
versity, as given in the ? Reminiscences of thirty years
residence in New South Wales,? by Judge Therry, and !
he was sure he should be pardoned for quoting a very
short extract of what fell from Sir Charles Nicholson on
that interesting occasion:?? Whatever tends (said Sir
Charles) to enlarge the domain of thought, to make
us acquainted with the things that have been before us,
and those that are beyond us, seems best to impress us
more deeply with sentiments of humility and reverence
for the Great Author of all things.? He would further
quote a few emphatic words of encouragement:?? I would
direct the gaze of the student, be he ever so poor and friend-
less, that here he may acquire a distinction, the reward
of merit only. Knowledge to him will here unfold
her ample stores?all the spoils of time?all the treasures
of thought, and all the bright domain of a glorious future
may here become his.? He would add that Sir Charles
Nicholson showed the most devoted zeal, not only by
giving his time and ability to the service of the university,
but by liberal donations?upwards of �3,000 in value?of
classical, medieval, and Egyptian antiquities, besides other
gifts. His duty now only remained to propose, what he
was sure would be readily agreed to by the meeting?
that their best thanks be presented to the author of the
admirable paper which they had heard this evening.
The vote of thanks having been passed,
Sir Charles Nicholson briefly acknowledged the com-
pliment paid to him. He wished to add one word in re-
ference to what had fallen from his excellent friend Mr.
Crawfurd, who desired to know his (Sir Charles?s) opinion
as to the perpetuity of the relations which existed between
this colony and the mother country. He could not but
express an earnest hope that the period when that connec-
tion, which now so happily subsisted, should be brought to
a close, might be remote. He also ventured to say this,
that when the separation did take place, the fault of that
separation would not be with the colony, but with the
mother country.
The Paper was illustrated by a collection of products
from the colonies referred to, kindly lent by the Victoria
Emigration Assistance Society; also a case, containing a
collection of gold specimens in nuggets, crystals, and grains,
oxide of tin (stream-tin), raenaccanite, platinum, iridium,
