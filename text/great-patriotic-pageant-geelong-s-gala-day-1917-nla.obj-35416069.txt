What Good Tyre Service Means!
It makes for Enjoyable Motoring. You are confident
of completing your run without tyre troubles, and
you cover thousands of miles under the same happy
conditions. When such service is obtainable at
a reasonable figure as with White Tread
DUNLOP TYRES
—then one appreciates the pleasures and economy of
Motoring. Unless the tyres are right, Motoring soon
loses its charm; and unless the price is right, the
cost per mile—plus the increased cost of petrol
makes Motoring expensive. With “Dunlops” you
can rely on the best of service—without paying an
exorbitant price for same. There’s nothing better
for miles or economy, and they are Australian.

The War Funds Board.
IMMEDIATELY after the outbreak of the Great War, on
4th August, 1914, the residents of Geelong and District gave
proof of their generous and patriotic feelings in subscribing
liberally to the various funds for the relief of our Soldiers and
their dependents, but it was not until February, 1915, when
the masterly appeal made by Mr. H. C. Hoover (now the
Director of Food Supplies for the United States) appeared in
the Australian Newspapers, calling the attention of the
civilised world to the stricken state of Belgium, that an
organised effort was made in the Geelong District to collect
and distribute War Relief Funds.
On the date of the publication of Mr. Hoover’s letter, at
a meeting in the Guild Hall, Myers Street, Geelong, Mr
Eustace F. Wilson, in a stirring speech, demanded that some-
thing should be done to relieve the gallant Belgians. At that
same meeting, Mr. D. F. Griffiths stated that, if properly
organised, Geelong could quickly collect £lOOO monthly for
the Belgian Relief Fund.
The citizens of Geelong thereupon demanded that prompt
action should be taken, and, on the 26th February, 1915, an
enthusiastic body of ladies met at the lown Hall to inaugurate
an active canvass of Geelong for weekly subscriptions to the
Belgian Relief Fund.
The Mayor (Cr. William Brownbill) was elected
President, and Mr. D. F. Griffiths Hon. Secretary of the
movement.
It was decided to call a public meeting to be held in the
City Hall, and at that meeting, held on the 2nd March, 1915,
it was resolved “ to create a Committee to do all in its power
to raise the minimum sum of £lOOO per month towards the
relief of the starving Belgians.” At that meeting, it was also
further unanimously decided to create an organisation to
control the Belgian Relief Fund, with the following officers
President :
The Mayor of the City of Geelong.
Vice-Presidents :
The Mayors of the Boroughs of Newtown and Chilwell,
Geelong West, and Queenscliff; and the Presidents of the
.Shires of Bannockburn, Barrabool, Bellanne, Cono, Meredith,
South Barwon and Winchelsea,


Advisory Board :
Messrs. E. A. Austin, T. E. Bostock, R. W. Dobson,
H. Hitchcock and J. H. McPhillimy.
Joint Treasurers :
Messrs. J. Spencer Nall and D. E. Neilson.
Joint Secretaries :
Messrs. D. F. Griffiths and T. G. Moore.
Subsequently, the Advisory Board was further strengthened
by the addition of Mr. W. E. Sargood.
Board Meetings :
The Advisory Board felt the urgent need of immediate
and businesslike action, and many hours were spent in seeing
that the organisation was well established and that matters
were arranged for a systematic contribution by all classes of
the community over a period of months.
Collecting Cards :
Special Collecting Cards were issued to the self-sacrificing
band of lady workers and canvassers, and to the painstaking-
work of these ladies the greater portion of the successful
campaign may be ascribed.
Where all were so willing to work, it is difficult and
perhaps unnecessary to apportion praise. It must be said,
however, that of the more thickly populated area, Geelong
West, under the supervision of Mayor Scarle and Mr. Harold
Crawcour, should easily be placed first.
Of the larger towns within the radius of 25 miles worked
by the Geelong Committee, Queenscliff and Bannockburn
stand out prominently as having done wonderfully well for the
population amongst which their committees worked.
Result of Campaign :
Of all the subscriptions that were sent from Australia for
the relief of the Belgians, it is believed that the £lOOO, which
was handed over by Sir Peter Mcßride, the Agent-General for
Victoria, on the 16th March, 1915, was the first to reach the
Belgian Relief Commission in London. Since then remit-
tances have been made totalling £14,790/10/4, and in all
£15,182/16/4 has been collected for the relief of the gallant
stricken people of Belgium.
On Thursday, 9th July, 1915, another public meeting
was held in the City Hall, with Mayor Brownbill in the chair,
when it was resolved to develop the Belgian Relief Fund
Committee into a new organisation which would be known as
“The Geelong and District War Funds Board.”


It was decided that the special objects of that Board
would be : —•
(1) To continue the present system of the Belgian
Relief Fund.
(2) To supervise and assist the Red Cross Fund.
(3) To establish a General Fund :
(a) For the assistance of returned and wounded
Soldiers, especially those from Geelong and
District.
(b) To establish any Fund that it was considered
advisable to form in connection with the War.
(c) To supplement if necessary the Red Cross and
Belgian Relief Fund.
(4) To control all funds in Geelong and District.
(5) To form a Fund at the conclusion of the War for a
suitable memorial to the Geelong and District
Soldiers.
The doubts of the sceptics as to the possibilities of raising
money for War purposes were quickly dispelled and, at the
date of going to press, the result of the work of the War Funds
Board has been, that the following sums, in round figures,
have been raised ;
Red Cross £22,750
Belgian Relief Fund 15,180
Australian Wounded Soldiers 6,200
Y.M.C.A 3.650'
Soldiers’ Comforts Fund 2,450
Christmas Boxes, 1917 450
British Red Cross 909
Returned Soldiers’ Club 250
Italian Red Cross 700
Soldiers’ Institute at Geelong Camp . . 517
French Orphans 220
Naval Appeal 220
Sundry Small Amounts 6,811
In addition to the amounts received by the
War Funds Board, the following amounts have
been subscribed in the Geelong District ;
Patriotic Fund 3,000
Wounded Soldiers 2,819
Billy Fund, 1915 425
Hot Water Plant for Camp 75
James Hill, Gift of Ambulance 500
Thomas King, Gift of Motor Car . . . . 435
Geelong Racing Club, Additional . . . . 1,275
State Schools’ Patriotic Fund 8,577
Sale of Ballengeich Bale of Wool . . .. 1,168
Madame Melba’s Concert 1,000
General War Funds 502
Total amount raised in Geelong £80,083


The present effort, known as “Geelong Gala Day,” to
raise £10,000 for the Red Cross, Soldiers’ Comforts Fund,
and the General Funds, will materially increase this amonut,
and in the near future, it is anticipated that the sum of
£100,000 will have been raised from the generous Geelong
public.
The Board pride itself on the fact that this money has
been raised with a minimum of expense. Not a penny has
been spent by way of commission, or in salaries, as all the
work has been honorary.
In the early stages of the War, the whole of the District
was systematically canvassed for regular subscriptions, but
while this system still continues, it latterly has been changing
and larger efforts are being held at intervals.
The War Funds Board itself has fixed on a policy of
holding one big effort a year, organised by a Special Com-
mittee of the Board. The first effort was called the Red Cross
Gala Day, and was held in November, 1916, and £5,500 was
raised for the Red Cross Fund. Other successful efforts were
the Sportsmen’s Carnival, at which the sum of £4,680 w r as
raised, and Australia Day, when £2,250 was netted. One of
the best efforts was made by Madame Melba on 24th Feb., 1915.
£1490 IN A NIGHT.
GEELONG’S GREAT PATRIOTIC EFFORT.
[.Extract from “ Geelong Times,” Feb. 25th, 1915.]
Ballarat plumed itself on what certainly was a big return
from the Melba Patriotic Concert there —£800. The most
optimistic of Geelong residents probably anticipated that this
would be exceeded, but by very few pounds. But from all
sources the concert in His Majesty’s Theatre produced a
grand total of £1490, or £3 above the sum raised at the first
similar concert in Melbourne, and considerably more than was
received in Adelaide. The door takings and sale of tickets
amounted to £459, and that meant a house packed and over-
flowing on to the stage. Outside and inside the hall State
School children sold programmes of the concert, and small
flags which were waved to the accompaniment of cheers at
exciting moments during the concert. From this source £20
were netted. Belgian flags were sold by Melba, seven in all,
and the bidding was responsible for £510 being contributed.
Two Union Jacks brought £215, and other Allied flags £39,
while the bale of wool that had already been the means of over
£1000 being raised, was the medium of an increase of £145
in the total. The proceeds of the sale of the wool and the
Belgian flags are to be devoted to the Belgian Relief Fund ;
the remainder of the receipts goes to the Red Cross Fund.
The individual amounts and the successful bidders for the lots

Mr. John Sanderson (who had already contributed £SO by a
cheque, through Madame Melba) added £5 to his bid of £7O
for the second Belgian flag. Many articles, particularly coins,
were donated by sympathisers, and it was anticipated that
these would be sold that night, but time would not permit.
In February last Mr. J. Spencer Nall enlisted for active
service, and Mr. N. J. David was elected as one of the Treasurers
in his place.
The men at the Front can rely upon the Geelong and
District War Funds Board using every endeavour to worthily
support them in their great efforts abroad.

City of Geelong.
BY A. L. WALTER, TOWN CLERK.
GEELONG, a City in the south of Victoria (Australia)
lies picturesquely nestled at the foot of the far-famed
Barrarbool Hills, and charmingly situated between
the shores of Corio Bay and the River Barwon,
whilst across the Bay, at a distance of a few miles, the tower-
ing peaks of the You Yangs loom out into the sky. Such
very briefly describes the situation of this manufacturing,
prosperous, and pretty City and its surroundings often
termed “The Naples of Victoria.”
Geelong is one of the oldest Municipalities and leading
cities in the State. It has many fine public buildings, amongst
which the Civic Chambers are the most prominent, and both
outside and inside are worthy of inspection. The design of
this building is eminently classical, as may be seen at a glance
from the reproduction herein. Its character is that profession-
ally known as the Roman lonic Order, carried out after the
chastest exemplars. "The interior fittings and furnishings
have all been completed in Australian timber.
The Art Gallery is adjacent to the City Hall, and was
erected by the citizens as a memorial to the late Mr. Geo. M.
Hitchcock, one of Geelong’s most prominent and liberal
citizens. The Gallery contains 150 pictures of high merit.
The Geelong District is noted as an Educational centre,
and three of the leading Public Schools in Australia are
established here, viz., The Church of England Grammar
School, The Geelong College, and The Church of England
Girls’ Grammar School. In addition, there are the High
School, and the Gordon Technical College, the latter having
proved’ itself of immense benefit for the technical training of
the young.
There are many other public buildings in the City, and
in the Tower of the fine Post Office is erected a clock and
chimes, donated by the citizens as a Memorial to commemor*

ate the life and reign of His late Majesty, King Edward VII.
Whilst referring to the Post Office, it may be mentioned that
Geelong was the first city in the Commonwealth to have the
automatic telephone service installed.
Geelong has been endowed by nature with splendid
facilities for manufactures. It has the Bay on the north side
with 30 feet of water right up to the shore. Some five years
ago, the Commonwealth Government of Australia secured the
services of an expert from Great Britain to select a site any-
where in the Commonwealth for the establishment of
Commonwealth Woollen Mills. He was given a free hand
with instructions that the site was to be selected on its merits.
Geelong’s superior advantages were again conspicuous, and
it was selected as the site for the Mills. These mills, costing
about £160,000, are in full operation and have turned out
cloth and other goods of the highest quality. There are also
a number of very large and privately owned woollen mills,
situated on the River Barwon, which have become famous
for their tweeds, and blankets, etc.
Geelong is lighted by gas and electricity, and an Electric
Tramway System is installed by the Melbourne Electric
Supply Co. Ltd., which also supplies current to the City for
lighting and power purposes. The plant of this Company
cost £200,000, and electric supply is available in 74 miles of
streets. It may not be out of place to state here that Geelong
is such an important manufacturing centre that 3500 horse
power of electric motors is in use in the City and suburbs.
Geelong is the natural Port for the Western District of
Victoria, a rich farming, fruitgrowing, and grazing country.
The Geelong Wool Sales are world-famed, highest prices for
Australian wools being obtained. To show the quantity of
wool sold, the turn-over for a wool sale season is about
150,000 bales. There are a number of large wool stores in
Citj; blit that of Dennys, Lascelles, Ltd., stands out
prominently, this wool store being the biggest in the world.
A portion of this store is erected in re-inforced concrete,
costing over £40,000. No wood whatever has been used,
and it is claimed that this is the largest floor in the world
without a support.
The late Sir Thomas Bent, Premier of Victoria, was
instrumental in creating a local Harbor Trust, controlled by
Commissioners, who have carried out many works costing
£290,000, including Freezing Stores and Chambers, Abat-
toirs, Shearing Sheds, Power House, Reclamation Works,
Wheat Sites, Wharves, Conveyors, and Railway Sidings.
'The Water Supply Works were purchased by the Munici-
palities from the Government, and a Bill was passed by
Parliament creating a Trust, controlled by Commissioners,
elected by the Ratepayers. Since the Trust was created some


ten years ago, the storage capacity of the reservoirs has been
increased from 565,000,000 gallons to 1,617,120,000 gallons.
The local Municipalities, intent on keeping the district in
the foreground from a sanitary point of view, obtained
powers from Parliament to permit the installation of sewerage
on the water carriage system, the effluent being conveyed by
sewer to the open ocean some nine miles from the City. This
is the only city in the State, outside the Metropolis, that is
sewered, and its advantages and benefits are inestimable.
the Salt Works is a very large industry carried on in the
district. Ihe area of the works consists of hundreds of acres
from which the salt is harvested and refined. This is one of
Geelong’s sights during the harvesting season.
Another large industry is that of Donaghy’s Rope Works,
established in 1852, the oldest in Australasia. Here are to be
found 3000 feet of rope walks, where ropes of all sizes are
made. This firm also manufactures coir mats, and its binder
twine is much sought after throughout the State.
The Railway business at Geelong has increased to such
an extent that the Department has had to spend many
thousands of pounds to cope with the traffic, and extensions
are still being made.
Whilst it has been pointed out that Geelong has been
favored with natural advantages, its citizens are ever alert to
improve the City, and it can be justly claimed that the City
has advanced in prosperity the last ten years by leaps and
bounds, perhaps even beyond the expectations of the most
optimistic.
Apart from being such a financially sound and prosperous
business City, its advantages as a holiday resort cannot be
overlooked. It is only a few miles from the shores of Bass
Strait, and excellent roads connect the City with the pretty
seaside resorts of Queenscliff, 19 miles; Barwon Heads, 14
miles ; Torquay, 14 miles ; Ocean Grove, 15 miles ; Portar-
lington, 19 miles; and Anglesea, 27 miles.
The following brief summary commends Geelong
Its healthy climate.
Its situation and accessibility.
Its manufactories.

Its sea baths.
Its fishing and yachting.

and has been for years, manufactured by a duly qualified Pharmaceutical Chemist.
Mr. George Reed. 17 Clarence Street, Geelong West, says: —“I feel it my duty
to testify to the speedy and wonderful cure effected on me by A.M.S. I was
seriously ill for a period of fifteen weeks, and during that time there were fre-
quently whole days I could not walk twenty paces without being completely exhausted.
I could eat very little without it disagreeing with me, and lost nearly two stone in
weight. I was advised by a friend to try A.M.S., and can honestly say before
finishing one bottle all the smothering feelings and palpitation had left me. I
still take a dose occasionally, and am gaining weight and feeling as well as ever I did.
I can bring many reputable citizens to testify to the above statement being true.”

Gordon Technical College.
J his Institution, the centre of so many activities that
make for the progress of the community, evolved from the old
Technological School, in Myers Street, conducted until the
latter Eighties” by the late Mr. Edmund Sasse. It owes its
existence chiefly to the enthusiasm of the late William
Humble, J.P., the public being led to accept the idea of com-
memorating General Gordon, the hero of Khartoum, by the
erection of a properly equipped Technical Institution. Its
foundation was assisted by the benefaction of the philan-
thropic Francis Ormond.
Art, Science, Trade, and Commercial Subjects have, from
its inception, been definitely provided for, and recent develop-
ments, at an expenditure of over £6,000, have been in the
direction of strengthening the Scientific and Engineering sides
of the work, particularly. Ihe Wool Department is now
one of the best equipped in the State, and the Commercial
Section, a feature of all Technical School work here and in
Great Britain, is a flourishing one. Further additions are
contemplated. The Government Grant, from £250, has
risen to well over £3,000.
