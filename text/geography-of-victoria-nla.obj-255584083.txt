investigation of the causes which brought about the fall of each Ministry
and the elevation of the succeeding one would afford material for an
instructive and not uninteresting chapter in the history of the colony.
In order to compile such a narrative, however, it would be necessary for
me to treat upon the subject of politics, with which the official writer must
not meddle. The historical portion of this volume must therefore end here.
36. When the Constitution was proclaimed the population of the Progress of
colony numbered 364,000, it now numbers 814,000; the land in cultiva-
tion amounted to 115,000 acres, it now amounts to over 1,000,000 tion of con-
acres; the bushels of wheat grown in a year numbered 1,150,000, they stltutloll ‘
now number 4,850,000; the sheep numbered 4,600,000, they now
number 11,250,000; the cattle numbered 530,000, they now number
1,000,000; the horses numbered 33,000, they now number not less than
200,000; the public revenue amounted to £2,728,000, it now amounts
to over £4,000,000; the value of imports was £12,000,000, it now
amounts to £17,000,000; the value of exports was £13,500,000, it now
amounts to £15,500,000, and this although the export of gold has fallen
off from £11,000,000 in the former to little over £4,000,000 in the past
year. For further evidences of progress the reader is referred to the
statistics given in a later portion of this work.
GEOGRAPHY.
3 1 . Victoria is situated at the south-east of, and is the southernmost Position of
colony* on, the Australian continent. It lies between the 34th and S,ctona '
39th parallels of south latitude, and the 141st and 150th meridians of
east longitude. Its extreme length from east to west is about 420
geographical miles, and its greatest breadth is about 250 miles. Its
extent of coast-line is nearly 600 miles.
38. According to the latest computation, the area of Victoria is Area of
88,198 square miles, or 56,446,720 acres. The whole continent of Victoria -
Australia is estimated to contain 2,983,264 square miles, and therefore
Victoria occupies about a thirty-fourth part of its surface. Great
Britain, exclusive of the islands in the British seas, contains 89,644
square miles, and is therefore slightly larger than Victoria.
39. Victoria is bounded on the north by the River Murray, and by a Northern
direct line running in a south-easterly direction from a place near the boundary -
* In consequence of its position at the extreme south of the Australian continent Victoria is often
mistaken, by English writers and others not well acquainted with Australian geography, for an adjacent
colony, which has been misnamed South Australia, the truth being that only a very small part of
•South Australia is situated further south than even the most northern portion of Victoria.


head waters of that stream, called the Springs, on Forest Hill, to Cape
Howe. The positions of the extremities of this line are as follow:
Latitude S. Longitude E.
The Springs 36 47 56'90 ... 148 11 5775
Cape Howe 37 30 23 09 ... 149 58 35'50
40, The western boundary of Victoria is a line about 242 geogra-
phical miles in length, approximating to the position of the 141st
meridian of east longitude, and extending from the Murray to the sea.
This line was some years since marked upon the ground as the 141st
meridian, which was intended to be the boundary between Victoria and
South Australia; but its true position is now found to be 140° 58' 7-26",
and it therefore follows that Victoria exercises jurisdiction over about
360 square miles of South Australian territory. Against this, South
Australia has recently raised a protest, and, by mutual consent of the
two colonies, the matter has been referred for the decision of the Privy
Council.*
41. The southern boundary of Victoria is the Southern Ocean, Bass’s
Straits, and the Pacific Ocean. The Southern Ocean is reckoned to
extend as far east as a line drawn from the north part of King’s Island
to Cape Otway; Bass’s Straits from that line to one drawn from the
north part of Flinders’ Island to Wilson’s Promontory; and the Pacific
Ocean from the last-mentioned line eastward.
42. The southernmost point in Victoria, and consequently in the
whole of Australia, is Wilson’s Promontory, which lies in latitude
39° 8' S., longitude 146° 26' E.; the northernmost point is the place
where the western boundary of the colony meets the Murray, lati-
tude 34° 2' S., longitude 140° 58' E. ; the point furthest east is Cape
Howe, situated in latitude 37° 3F S., longitude 149° 59' E. ; the most
westerly point is the line of the whole western frontier, which,
according to the latest computation, lies upon the meridian 140° 58' E.,
and extends from latitude 34° 2' S. to latitude 38° 4' S., or 242
geographical miles.
* The boundary line between Victoria and South Australia—the former being then the Port Phillip
district of New South Wales—was marked on the ground in 1847-1849, and in the South Australian
Government Gazette of the period the line thus indicated was accepted as the correct boundary between
the two colonies. The geodetic survey of Victoria was commenced in 1857, and according to the first
observations made by the surveying staff, the marked line appeared to be miles to the eastward of
its proper position, and it was consequently supposed that South Australia had encroached upon Vic-
toria to that extent all along the frontier. It was afterwards discovered that, owing to errors in the
Nautical Almanac, the Victorian geodetic lines had been placed 4 miles too far to the westward, the
necessary result being that, instead of South Australia having possession of any portion of the territory
of Victoria, the latter was in occupation of a strip of South Australian territory 1J miles broad and
242 miles long. This fact the South Australian Government submitted should be held to be suf-
cient reason for the re-consideration and re-marking of the boundary line. But to this the Victorian
Government objected, more especially as they had taken no steps to have the line altered when the
error was supposed to be 2J miles the other way, and also because in the present state of science, it is
admitted to be impossible in these latitudes to lay down meridians at very great distances from the
primary within a nearer approximation to their true position than a quarter of a mile, so that, if the
boundary were re-adjusted now, improved methods in a few years might indicate that the line was
still wrong. The matter was referred in 1874 for the decision of the Privy Council, and is not yet
settled. It may be observed that what is known of the position of the marked boundary line is;
entirely due to Victorian observers, and South Australia has never taken any steps towards testing
the accuracy of their observations.


43. An astronomical observatory was erected at Williamstown in
1853; and in 1858 a temporary observatory was erected on Flagstaff
Hill, Melbourne. In 1863 the apparatus and working "staff were removed
from Flagstaff Hill to the Melbourne Observatory, a building specially
erected for observatory purposes on the Government reserve on the
south side of the River Yarra.* According to the latest computation
the positions of these observatories are as follow:

45. Victoria has been divided for various purposes into many different
divisions. There are counties, municipal districts, electoral districts,
electoral provinces, mining districts, pastoral districts, police districts,
general sessions districts, circuit court districts, bailiwicks, deputy
registrars’ districts, parishes, &c. It is to be regretted that these
divisions have not been made upon some general plan, so that they

for this work by Mr. E. J. White, the present Acting Government Astronomer, will he found in an
appendix post.


would fit in with each other without overlapping. This, however, is
rarely the case, and great inconvenience is occasionally caused thereby.
The most important of these divisions, and those of which the
boundaries are least likely to be changed, are the counties. These
number 37, and their names are as follow; the population and number
of houses in each county, according to the returns of the last census,

Mountains 47. Victoria is traversed with more or less regularity throughout its
whole length by a chain of hills completely dividing it into two parts,
and thence called the Dividing Range. This range runs in an east and
west direction, generally at a distance of 60 or 70 miles from the coast.
The streams to the notth of it run towards the Murray, those to the
south of it towards the sea. The eastern part of it, which divides the
Gippsland district from that of the Murray, is called the Australian
Alps, and that part which separates the county of Ripon from that of
that of
Boning and extends northwards into the county of Kara Kara is called
the Pyrenees. There are also other ranges extending in different parts
of the country, many of which are offshoots of the main chain. The
principal are the Benambra and the Gibbo ranges, in the county of
Benambra; the Bogong range, in the county of Bogong; the Buffalo
and Strathbogie ranges, in the county of Delatite; the Putter range,
in the counties of Delatite and Moira; the Baw Baw range, dividing
the counties of Evelyn and Buln Buln; the Hoddle range, in the county
of Buln Buln; Mount Delegete, in the county of Croajingolong; Mount
Wellington, in Wonnangatta; the Dandenong ranges, in Evelyn and
Mornington; Mount Alexander and Jim Crow ranges, both in the
county of Talbot; the Grampians, in the county of Boning; the Serra
range, between the counties of Dundas and Ripon; the Victoria ranges,
in the county of Dundas; the Black range, in the county of Lowan,
There are besides numerous isolated peaks in different parts of the
colony. A list of the mountains and hills in Victoria, showing also the
counties in which they are situated, and the elevation of the principal


peaks above the level of the sea, recently corrected by Mr. Surveyor-
General Skene, according to the latest information in the possession of
his department, is given as follows:

48. The
rivers
Victoria
are for the most part of
inconsiderable
size. Many of them are liable to be partially dried up during the
summer months, so as to be reduced at that season to mere chains of
waterholes. With the exception of the Yarra, on the banks of which
the metropolis is situated, the Goulburn, which empties itself into the
Murray about eight miles to the eastward of Echuca, and the Murray
itself, with perhaps some of the Gippsland streams, not one of them is
navigable, except by boats. As, however, they drain the watershed of
large areas of country, they will ultimately be made feeders to perma-


nent reservoirs for tlie purposes of irrigation, gold washing and manu-
factures. The Murray, which forms the northern boundary of the
colony, is the largest
for 670 of which it fl
principal rivers ii
lengths, originally
corrected by Mr. £
mation, are as follow
rgest river in Australia. Its total length is 2400 miles,
lit flows along the Victorian border. The names of the

49. Yictoria contains numerous salt and fresh water lakes and
lagoons, but many of these are little more than swamps during dry
seasons. Some of them are craters of extinct volcanoes. Lake Coran-
gamite (counties Grenville and Hampden), the largest inland lake in
the colony, covers 76 square miles, and is quite salt, notwithstanding
its augmentation by numerous fresh-water streams; it has no visible
outlet. Lake Colac (county Polwarth), only a few miles distant from
Lake Corangamite, is a beautiful sheet of water, 10 square miles in
extent, and quite fresh. Lake Burrumbeet, in the county of Bipon, is
also a fine sheet of fresh water, embracing an area of 8| square miles.
The Gippsland lakes—Yictoria and King, in the county of Tanjil, and
Reeve, in the county of Buln Buln—are situated close to the coast, and
are only separated from the sea by a narrow belt of sand. Through this
there is an entrance, which is often navigable, but is subject to be closed
at irregular intervals, in consequence of the shifting of the sand at its
mouth. Lake Wellington (county Tanjil), the largest of all the Gipps-
land lakes, lies to the westward of Lakes Yictoria and Reeve (county
Buln Buln), and is connected with the first-named by a narrow channel.
South-east of Geelong, in the county of Grant, is Lake Connewarre,
connected with the sea at Point Plinders. The following is a list of the
lakes in Yictoria, with their localities and areas, corrected to latest date,
under the direction of Mr. Surveyor-General Skene
Lakes.
(Those lakes which contain fresh water are distinguished by the letter F, and those which consist of
salt or brackish water are indicated by the letters S, and B. respectively.

Bays, inlets, 50. The principal inlet on the coast of Victoria is Port Phillip Bay,
which is an inland sea of an extreme length of over 30 geographical
miles from north to south, and of about 35 from east to west. The


entrance is about two miles across, and a short distance within it are
sandbanks and islands, which, whilst they act as an excellent break-
water to the shipping, do not, as there are well-buoyed channels between
them, seriously obstruct the navigation. In Port Phillip Bay are two
minor bays, viz., Hobson’s Bay, which is the anchorage of the port of
Melbourne, and the point at which the River Yarra, on which Melbourne
is situated, empties itself; and Corio Bay, which is the anchorage of
the port of Geelong. The next inlet in point of natural importance to
Port Phillip is Western Port, in part of which there is anchorage with
good shelter in all winds. The other bays and inlets are either road-
steads affording only partial shelter, or are small in extent, or so
obstructed by sandbanks as to be suitable for small vessels only. Some
of the roadsteads might be much improved by the construction of break-
waters. Towards the eastern part of the coast is a sandy beach,
extending for 90 miles without an inlet, except one leading into the
Gippsland lakes, which is liable to be closed at intervals. The following
are the names and positions of the principal bays and inlets, commencing
at the western extremity of the coast: —

51. A glance at the map of Victoria will show that the coast line
projects considerably to the south in two directions, one being to the
west and the other to the east of the entrance to Port Phillip Bay.
The extreme point of the western projection is Cape Otway, that of the
eastern one Wilson’s Promontory, the latter being, as has been already
stated, the southernmost point on the continent of Australia. There is,
besides these, a projection of less extent to the west of Portland Bay,
the southernmost point of which is Cape Nelson. The following are
the principal capes and points along the whole coast, with their

52. Victoria exercises jurisdiction over but few islands, and of those,
all except Phillip Island, which is situated in Western Port, are but
scantily inhabited. The largest is French Island, also situated in
Western Port; but the greater part of it is covered with mud flats and
swamps, and so it maintains a small population only. The characteristics
of Snake and Sunday Islands, situated off Port Albert, between Corner
and Shoal Inlets, are similar to those of French Island. The islands
in Bass’s Straits, except such as are close to the Victorian coast, are
dependencies of Tasmania. The following is a list of the Victorian
islands, showing also their positions, and the populations of such of them
as were inhabited when the last census was taken :

a country are affected, is undoubtedly the temperature. This, therefore,
it is my intention first to touch upon.
Yearly mean 56. The mean temperature of the air in Melbourne, derived from
at*M6i- atUre observations* extending over a period of fourteen years, is 5 7-6°. Upon
boume. examining a chart showing isothermal lines, it will be found that
Melbourne is situated upon or near the line corresponding with that in
the northern hemisphere on which Marseilles, Bordeaux, Bologna, Nice,
Verona, and Madrid are situated. Professor Neumayer, however, points
out that the difference between winter and summer, and the hottest and
coldest month, is far less in Victoria than in any of these places; and
that, with regard to the differences referred to, Melbourne more closely
resembles Lisbon, and still more so Maffra, 18 miles to the northwest of
Lisbon, situated 700 feet above the level of the sea and in latitude
38° 55' north.
Seasons. 57. The three months from September to November are considered
in Victoria to be the spring quarter; those from December to February
the summer quarter; those from March to May the autumn quarter ;
and those from June to August the winter quarter.
Mean tem- 58. The mean temperature of the autumn quarter in Melbourne is, on
quarters at ie avera g e ; nearly two degrees (I'7°) higher than that of the spring-
Melbourne, quarter; and the mean temperature of the summer quarter is, on the
average, over sixteen degrees (16‘I 0 ) higher than that of the winter
quarter. This will be observed from the following figures, based upon
observations extending over fourteen years :

The following figures,

derived from observations taken at that Obser- ™ nge .

Melbourne.
* The means by which the highest solar radiation and the lowest terrestial radiation are observed
are thus described by the Government Astronomer“ The maximum temperature of solar radiation
is observed by means of a thermometer placed horizontally on a wooden frame 5 feet from the ground
whose bulb is made of black glass externally covered with fine lampblack and enclosed in an outer
and exhausted tube of transparent glass. The minimum terrestrial radiation is observed by means
of an ordinary self-registering minimum spirit thermometer, the bulb of which is placed in the focus of
a parabolic reflector well silvered and polished, exposed to the sky; the instrument is placed in a
double-sided box, the whole protected from undue radiation by a small wooden house, the walls of
which are nearly 6 feet high, whilst the reflector itself is 17 inches from the ground.”
