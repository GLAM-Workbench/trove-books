A Light Horse Camp in Egypt.
Algerian Cavalry.
One regiment of these French Colonial Troops
was attached to the Light Horse in F.gypt.
The Road to the Pyramids.
Traversed by thousands of Australians in
their search for information of the ancient
Pharoahs.
4
5
The Light Horse Cemetery.
Armoured Cars in Action.
General Allenby’s advance derived consider-
able help from this very mobile branch of the
Service.
“Why the Camel got the Hump.”
The camel, undoubtedly, was one of the most
useful means of transport through the desert.
There were 60,000 used by General Allenby’s
army, and the almost impossible was achieved,
inasmuch as these camels were compelled
quite often to ford rivers, a very difficult pro-
ceeding, as the camel has a decided aversion
to water except as a beverage.
7
8
Desert Railway.
The Last of the Australians to Leave
Palestine.


9 Turkish Prisoners.
A few of whom, it will be noticed, are wear-
ing sand goggles to protect their eyes from the
sand.
10 A Persian Well.
This well is identical with those used in
Biblical times. This custom of drawing water
in the East is 2,000 years old. The beam
resting on the bullock’s neck is provided with
a short iron spike, so that should the poor
beast feel inclined to slacken his pace, this
spike, helped by the weight of the beam, per-
suades him to carry on.
11 King David’s Tower.
It was beneath the walls of this tower that
General Allenby received the final capitulation
of Jerusalem.
12 Crossing the Jordan.
The Light Horse on their way to Damascus.
13 The Capture of Damascus.
The Light Horse entering the City after its
conquest.
14 Light Horse Behind Jerusalem.
15 The Train-de-luxe.
This method of transport per cattle truck can
be explained by any of the troops who par-
ticipated in this luxurious mode of travelling.
16 Jaffa Gate, Jerusalem.
The breach in the Wall was cut by the Kaiser’s
special orders so that he might enter the City
with his usual retinue of gaily clad officials.
On the occasion of the Kaiser’s visit, he was
clad in a long white robe and riding a white
Arab horse, and also wearing a silver helmet
surmounted by the Prussian Eagle, and
attended by a staff clad more or less in similar
gorgeous uniforms. On the Mount of Olives,
in Jerusalem, is a huge palace also erected by


23
The Light Horse Cemetery on the
Shores of the Sea of Gallilee.
24
Skulls.
25
Light Horse Watering Horses.
26
Cemetery and Memorial to those of the
Anzac Light Horse who fell in Pales-
tine.
27
The First Division Headquarters at Tel-
el-Kebir.
28
The Shadow of Civilisation.
the Kaiser. It was here that the Kaiser de-
livered an oration as if he were God’s medium
for the deliverance of Jerusalem. On the
other hand, try to imagine the actual con-
queror—General Allenby—entering through
the small gate on foot, and practically un-
attended, receiving the submission of the City,
and then quietly remarking to the staff officer
as he walked back to his horse—“ Now let us
get on with the War.”
General Chauvel.
A brilliant cavalry leader attached to the Aus-
tralian Light Horse in Egypt.
The Sphinx.
A Visit to the Pyramids.
New Jerusalem.
“Jericho Jane.”
This photograph shows “Her Ladyship” just
as she was left by the Turks in their hurried
retreat. It was after salvaged and taken to
Cairo.
A unique aerial photograph of the Pyramids.
The shadow of the ’plane from which this
photograph was taken will be seen on the
right of the picture.


One of the Tanks at Gaza.
This tank apparently had a rough time, and
her internal mechanism is being eagerly ex-
amined by some members of the Light Horse.
Mount of Olives.
In the background can be seen the spire of the
Sultan’s Palace, mentioned in photograph 16.
Pontoon Bridge over the Jordan.
“You’re Next, Sir!”
This is only one of the many accomplishments
of the digger. The tonsorial artist shown
here is now a Major and his victim a Lieu-
tenant.
Camp at Tel-el-Kebir.
The General Review in Egypt.
Amongst the group are General Murray and
General Foote.
Light Horse Camp in Egypt,
After the cessation of hostilities.
Cairo Cemetery.
The Charge of the Light Horse.
An actual photograph of the Light Horse in
one of their memorable charges during the
Egyptian Campaign.
Some of the Light Horse Watering their
Horses in the Sea of Gallilee.


GALLIPOLI SERIES
The Chess Board.
So called because of the repeated attack and
counter-attack, until, as one of the diggers re-
marked—“it was a case of ‘who moves
next.’ ”
Periscope Rifle.
By means of this periscopic attachment, it
was possible to fire over the parapet without
exposing oneself to the enemy.

Brown’s Dip.
Turks Sniping at a British Aeroplane.

Watson’s Pier.
First Divisional Headquarters Dugout on
the Peninsula.
View from the Beach showing the well-
known Rock known as the “Pimple.”
Looking towards Gaba Tepe.
The Turks Who Came to Stay.
This picture was taken from the trenches
after the memorable 24th May, 1915, when
Johnny Turk endeavoured to carry out his
threat of driving the Australians into the sea.
The Turks carried full equipment, including
blankets, which was proof of their intention
and hope to retain our trenches permanently.
Those who stayed are portrayed here. The
others have changed their opinion of the Aus-
tralian’s ability as a soldier.
Suvla Bay.


15 Martyn’s Lane.
An historic trench on Gallipoli.
16 Looking towards the Sniper’s Post.
See No. 20.

18 The Evacuation of-Gallipoli.
Showing the stores being blown up on the
shore. This picture was taken from the deck
of one of the battle ships which covered the
Evacuation.
19 Anzac Cove.
20 The Sniper’s Post.
There are many anecdotes of this remarkable
spot, and one is that a Turkish sniper had his
position here and proved a great source of
annoyance to our troops. Who it was that
actually brought him down is rather uncertain,
as the claimants to this honor are many.
21 Not a Rabbit Warren—
But a number of dugouts near the beach.
22 Dugouts Occupied by the First Division
Staff.
23 Hell Spit Cemetery.
24 North Beach.
25 H.M.S. “Swiftsure.”

donated by General Blarney, C. 8., C.M.G.,
D. 5.0., Croix de Guerre.
27 Indian Camp, Gallipoli.
Owing to their religious beliefs, the Hindoos
refused to eat meat killed by a Christian, they
were, therefore, provided with goats, as seen
here, from which they obtained their rations.
28 Anzac Cove and Hell Spit.
Looking South.


29 Anzac Cove and New Zealand Point.

on the Somme.
9 Travelling Circus.
One of the long range heavies inspected by

10 Liquid Fire.

stances, the tank has a pathetic appearance as
we see it here.

Bapaume.
13 A Standing Memorial to Hun “Kultur.”
14 The Water Tower at Ypres.
15 “R.1.P.”

A most remarkable picture emphasising the
frequent occurrence of a crucifix standing un-
harmed whilst practically all buildings in the
vicinity are demolished.
18 Aerial Photograph of Ypres Asylum.

21 Surgical Ward, C.C.S.

39 “Old Stick in the Mud.”
One of the greatest difficulties with which we
had to contend in Flanders was the mud.
Even the tanks got stuck.
10 The Warlencourt-Bapaume Road.
A favorite mark for enemy artillery.
41 “Joy Riding.”
Off to Abbeville for a day’s fun.
42 Zonnebeke Chateau.
Aerial photograph taken during the Paschen-

wanton destruction of the Huns.

ing the Hun evacuation of Lille.

56 On the Summit of Messines.
This pillbox is a land mark which will be

57 Anti-Tank Rifle.
One Hun power invention; about as effective
in stopping tanks as a pea rifle would be in
stopping an old man kangaroo.
| Big and Little Willie.
These two photographs were souvenired from
a Hun prisoner who, doubtless by now is dis-
illusioned as to the powers of his High Fright-
fulness, etc., etc.
60 General Mangin.
Inspecting Anti-Air Craft Guns.


61 Baillieul Asylum.
Aerial Photograph.
62 The Cloth Hall, Ypres.
Even this remarkable picture of this world-
famed building can hardly depict the awful
desolation of Ypres. The authorities of Bel-
gium intend to preserve the ruins of the Cloth
Hall and Cathedral as a standing reproach to
Hun “Kultur.”
63 Ypres from the Air, 1918.
Showing Paschendaele Ridge in the back-
ground.
64 War in the Air.
65 The Victor.
66 The Vanquished.

counter between an Italian and Hun aviator.
The pictures need no explanation beyond this.
67 General Blarney, C. 8., C.M.G., D. 5.0.,
Croix de Guerre.

One of the final battle fields of the A.1.F., and

69 “Desecration.”
70 All that is left of the Long Wall of the
Cloth Hall, Ypres.
71 “Desolation.”
Ypres Cathedral.
72 Notice to Tourists.
Soon after the Armistice tourists swarmed all
over the battlefields of France, in some cases
desecrating the spots which the men of the
Empire had laid down their lives to protect.
It was to prevent the gradual disappearance of
Ypres by souvenir hunters that the British
Town Major in charge of Ypres ordered the
notice to be erected.


82
Effect of a Road Mine.
Fired by the enemy in the retreat of 1918.

few Triplanes used during the War.
Aerial Photograph of a Trench System,
and the effect of Artillery Bombard-
ment.
Dickiebusch,
All that remains of that once pretty village.
Bomb Explosion.
A remarkable photograph, and one which the
photographer is not likely to forget, as both
he and the camera were hurled some distance
by the shock of the explosion, but fortunately
escaped with a few bruises.


Amiens Square.
The good opinion of the population of Amiens,
of Australian troops, was emphasised when
some of our battalions returned to billet there
after stopping the Hun’s advadce. The boys
were acclaimed as the saviours of Amiens.
One pathetic instance being that of an old
man clinging to the knees of a stalwart Aussie
Corporal and thanking him in broken English
for saving his little home and people.
Bridge Blown Up by the Huns in their
Retreat, at Oudenarde.
Just another instance of the manner in
which the gentle Hun conducts his
warfare.
Messines Cemetery.
The Summit of Mount Kemmel.
The few bricks shown in the picture arc all
that remain of a Church and Convent.
“The Long, Long Trail.”
Over Messines Ridge.
Armentiercs Canal.
Hyde Park Corner.
The dugouts shown in this picture were used
during the battle of Messines as an Advance
Dressing Station. It was also at this comer
that the Red Cross thoughtfully provided the
wounded with hot tea, biscuits, cigarettes,
chocolates, etc.
“Souvenir Gully.”
This shell hole on Mt. Kemmel contains a few
of the iron rations occasionally sent us by the
Hun. Fortunately for those nearby the big
one was a “Dud.”
Mont-des-Cats.
Quite a number of Corps Schools were situ-
ated around this district.


101 Market Square, Poperhinge.
This town has not been badly damaged, the
building in the foreground is the result of a
casual shell from one of the enemy’s long
range guns. Ask your friend who has visited
Poperhinge if he remembers “Skindles.”
102 Australian Ambulance Cars.
These three ambulance cars are the only sur-
vivors of the original 23 that left Australia
with the 4th Divisional Motor Ambulance C.
They have carried casualties in every stunt in
which the 4th Division has participated. The
little boy seated on the centre car was found
wandering alone in a deserted Somme village.
He remained with this Unit as their mascot
for eight months after which he was reluct-
• antly returned to his parents.
103 Army Corps Headquarters at Ham-sur-
Heure.
104 An S.E. 5 and Bristol Monoplane.
Before and After.
These two pictures give some idea of the effect
of a modern artillery bombardment. The
second picture was taken ten days after the
first, and depicts the village of Roeux, after
the battle of Arras.
107 The Square at Arras.
108 Albert Cathedral, 1916.
A well known land mark to all Australian
troops, as all who took part in the great
battles of the Somme Offensive had to pass
under this figure.
The infant Saviour, with outstretched arms, is
held by the leaning Madonna as though bless-
ing the troops on their way to attack Pozieres,
July, 1916.
109 Albert Cathedral, 1918.
A remarkable story was prevalent amongst the
French people that the War would not end


until the Madonna fell. Strangely enough,
within a short time of the destruction of the
tower, the great and final German retreat com-
menced.
Looking Towards Messines Ridge.
In Warneton Trenches.
A Gotha.
Captured German photograph.
Nurses’ Cookhouse.
In the grounds of an old Chateau near
Baillieul.
Nurses’ Dugout.
In which the nurses were supposed to take
shelter during an air raid, but unselfish as our
“little sisters” always are, it was the patients
who could be moved that were placed in
shelter, whilst the nurses continued their ar-
duous duties with their usual cheery smile.

6 The Duke of Connaught at Cologne.
How galling it must be to the Prussians who

presentatives of “that contemptible little
Army” and “obsolete Navy” quietly and unos-
tentatiously carrying on their particular duties
in Hunland.
