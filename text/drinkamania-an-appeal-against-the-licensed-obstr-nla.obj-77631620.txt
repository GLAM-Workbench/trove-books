INTRODUCTION.
While other Poets ?favorites of the day
Their various talents, or their taste display :
Clothe their ideas in loveliness and truth,
To Age give pleasure, or enrapture Youth ;
Friendship and Love their ever pleasing theme,
Or revel in some sweet Arcadian dream ;
Warble like Kendal, Bailor an, or Moore,
Or strains Harpur- ian never sang before,
Whose ?Spring-Life-Lyrics,? weary souls beguile.
Or happier numbers flow in melting style ;
Touches of beauty, burnish every line,
And wrap the reader in a cloud sublime?
Bask in that honor patent to the few,
Arrest attention, and approval too,
Perchance Tis more than quaint Old Wood can do.
Be it his province simply to relate ?
The evils common to our social state.
Point to the Homes of Penury and Care,
And contemplate the desolation there,
Ask the fair question, and trace out the cause,
? Our moral weakness ?or imperfect laws.
Some may despise it as a morbid tale,
? With good intention ?but of no avail?
While others differ, and approving feel,
? The Man does right in making this appeal.
?Good may accrue?for now strange things occur,
? Nought can be done without we make a stir.?
In thin opinion feeling somewhat fervent,
He now subscribes himself
Your hu'uble Servant.


you,
r
DEINKAMAKIA.
Ye Guardians of the Public Weal ?
Colonial Rights and health ?
Give audience to a fair appeal
And aid the Common-Wealth.
As Children to their Parents bend,
In danger or distress,
On natural sympathy depend
Por solace and redress.
With the same genial confidence
Your high regard we claim.
To undisputed evidence
Of misery and shame.
Believing, as we justly do,
(Whoever may dissent),
That blame or honor falls on
Who rule in Parliament.
If Virtue will a land exalt,
Or Vice degrade a Nation,
The merit, or perhaps the fault,
Is due to Legislation.
Impress?d with these ideas we pray,
(Our reasons couch?d in rhyme),
Your HONORABLE HOUSE to stay,
A fertile source of
crime.


Of all the social ills we know,
This lies most grievous on us,
Inflicting a tremendous blow
To sound progressive Commerce
That all-corroding evil, DRINK,
Makes fearful innovation.
The energies of SYDNEY sink.
In liquor-bound prostration.
Ascribe depression to Free Trade,
Impute whatever cause.
All must admit ?we retrograde?
Beneath existing laws.
Our splendid Ships?our Stores denote.
How vast this direful trade.
The sums immense the Customs quote
Proclaim how STATE is paid.
Palatial buildings proudly rise.
In architecture grand,
With pyrimidical supplies
To devastate the land.
Cask upon cask?and case on case?
Piled high as they can go?
While heavy hogsheads find their place
In cellars down below.
Far in the bush, where Kangaroo
May unmolested pass.
In Crusoe solitudes we view
Our curse, ?The broken glass T*


Aye ! on the lonely desert sod
Where parching heat will throttle,
Wherever human foot has trod
There silent lies ?? The Bottle 1?
Or sail the ever restless deep,
On snow crest wave is seen.
Now and again to slyly peep,
Its head?a ? Dead Marine I?
While here Mechanics half employed
Bight honest men and willing.
In all directions are decoved
*
Till fleeced of every shilling.
What melancholy Men we meet.
Once cheerful and genteel.
Dejected walk the busy street
(For whom none seem to feel,)
Some of no ordinary mind,
Poor noblerising slaves.
Grope on their feverish way to find
Dishonorable graves.
Why vainly search for ? The Poor Man,?
In some far distant region,
Bead as you run Sir, for you can,
Their name alas 1 is LEGION,
Where?er we turn, or raise the head,
7
These words ensnare and trick us?-
? LICENSED TO RETAIL FERMENTED
AND SPIRITUOUS LIQUORS.?


From streak of dawn, till midnight hour.
It draws the people in,
And with infatuating power
Encourages to sin.
The reckless License, we surmise.
Afflicts our reputation
And happy homes come by surprise
To want and degradation.
The License turns night into day.
The day to doleful night ;
Leads many a hopeful youth astray
Who else had gone aright.
Making the babbler?s tongue run slick
In empty brag and scorn,
Abuse and ridicule flow quick.
The helmsman Reason gone*
Resigned our feelings to excite,
<D
Nips friendship in the bud.
Provokes the peaceable to fight.
And ends disputes in blood.
Keeps up a large expensive Force
All night and day to roam,
Who hunt the houseless off the course.
Or help the drunkard home.
Rrings free and easy souls in debt.
Compelled to pledge or borrow.
Drowns common sense in ?heavy wet,?
And fills the cup of sorrow.


Ease by degrees the poor man?s Cot
Of all its furniture,
Melt comforts honest labour got,
And leave him truly poor.
To bring a kind defenceless Wife,
And Children to privation,
Affectthe bullet or the knife.
In savage desperation.
How poor is magisterial power.
The lock up, or the fine.
The Poor are tempted every hour,
To idleness and crime.
?Tis hard to scourge the rising race
With bad example train,
i?he Prison find their dwelling place,
Their heritage?the chain.
Visit the school at Cockatoo,
Broadarrow-tonians speak,
Let those describe what drink can do
Who lodtm at Tar ban Creek.
O
A serious view of Darlinghurst
Might cuie a Sceptic grinning.
There over many groans might burst,
More sinned against than sinning.
Once honest young and hopeful men,
With nature far too free,
Their weakness and the drink condemn
For all their misery.


A famous Preacher of the day,
(Our leading journal stated),
Was in his lecture pleased to say.
We?re not yet educated
To such a point, as to demand,
(At least to all appearance).
The Legislature of the land
To make an interference.
Here let him pause, correct the type.
Nor let it be forgotten.
In ? lush? we are not merely ripe,
But only?nearly rotten.
Bosh ! others say ?what vapid stuff,
You?re not compelled?pray drop it?
Each one should know?when had enough.
And at that moment, stop it.
Who made you ruler or a judge ?
Defining social wrong,
Shut up such sentimental fudge,
And close your mournful song.
Should know when had enough, alas I
All know full well who take it,
Slaves of the habit and the glass,
How seldom such can break it.
All know indeed?but pray reflect.
How few are wise in doing ,
If weak our nature ?then protect
Not revel in her ruin.


Awhile to yonder hill resort,
By old acquaintance led.
It not a tear?vouchsafe a thought.
In pity for the dead.
What argument can soundly hear,
Or moral reasoning show.
That trade legitimate or fair,
Which thrives on human woe.
It yields a sad and irksome life,
Ye Publicans attest.
How oft the Daughter or the Wife,
I 1 eel at the Bar opprest.
Serve wretched creatures in distress.
Bear with the vulgar chaff,
Quell the fierce riot?or suppress
The loud and vacant laugh.
Nod meek assent to flimsy cant,
A madman?s passion rule,
Submit for threepence to the rant.
Of some besotted fool.
Pay heavy Duty, Fees, and Rents,
Work hard from morn to night.
O /
Bear patiently all insolence.
Yet be to all polite.
Can such a calling pleasure give.
Or noble minds employ.
Or can domestic comfort live,
Amid such doubtful joy.


And when the end of all is met,
How few have fortunes made,
And even those at last regret,
This Great unhallowed trade.
Degrading custom ?tis ?and strange
Here Master Tradesmen meet,
"Who should enjoy their own Exchange,
With requisites complete.
Where the employer and employed,
Could mingle every day,
o ?> ?
And not by drinking be annoyed.
Nor block the public way.
The hint perchance may not be lost
The Council yet may call,
For tenders at a moderate cost,
To build the ?Trademen?s Hall.?
And shall this decimating drink,
Pursue its ruthless way ?
Shall moral courage pale and shrink,
Before its Moloch sway ?
Resistless floods roll o?er the plain,
The wheat with rust may die,
Infecting scab become our bane.
Bold robbers ?law defy.
Cattle and stores be wash?d away,
All food and produce spoil,
Deep ravages no skill can stay,
Depress the Sons of toil.


But there are souls can sympathise,
Reciprocate the grief,
The warm and ready hand supplies.
The requisite relief.
The wasting floods again recede,
The waving grain appears,
The healthy sheep in thousands feed.
And Labour dries her tears.
Corn, fruit, and flowers in beauty bloom
No blight our hopes alloy,
No vestige left of former gloom,
For Plenty crowns the joy.
Not so ! the Human Wreck we view !
The havock we deplore,
Nature may clothe herself anew,
And lovelier than before,
But dissipated Flesh and Blood,
Rolls on its fearful course,
Body and Soul once on this flood,
Descend from bad to worse.
Let the Bushranger and his Band,
The travellers path waylay,
Fill certain districts of the land.
With terror and dismay.
The artful Forger may succeed.
Banks mav sustain a loss,
No eye to check the daring deed.
But Justice tracks his course.


Hark! in the stillness of the night,
Who strikes the felon?s door ?
The trembling wretch essays a flight,
But ? OUST? escapes no more.
Tims depredations Rogues commit,
Ensure their own reward,
Those rebels to the chain submit,
Or more impressive cord .
Yet through our City, lanes, and roads,
Prowl thieves of high renown,
Enter at pleasure our abodes,
And brings the inmates down.
? BRANDY? both pale and dark beguiles,
The way-farer to come,
In every corner lurking smiles,
That arch deceiver ? RUM.?
Not far ?OLD TOM?in ambush lies.
With his deceptive nips,
While sweet seductive ? GIN? applies,
Her nectar to the lips.
These with a few Associates,
Less potent in their station,
The Body Social enervates.
They dislocate Creation.
While Spirit Merchants will import,
Their drugs from every quarter,
We need sharp lessons and be taucht,
By equal floods of water.


The learned Judge in open Court,
Will solemnly declare,
Of all the crimes before him brought,
In most, the drink is there.
The Messenger of Life and Peace,
Glad tidings may proclaim,
With outstretched arms and bended knees.
The Drunkard would reclaim.
Mercy and Love Divine impart,
His holy mission fails,
No mortal power can reach the heart,
While this disease prevails.
Let Pestilence its ruin spread,
War with its horrors track us,
The hungry Sea count up its dead !
But who can slay like ?BACCHUS ??*
Oh never did a Monster yet,
Debase the godlike mind,
Or plague more deadly ever set,
Its spot upon mankind.
Can Christian men devoutly pray,
? Deliver us from evil,?
Who place the bottle in the way,
And cater for the devil.
We rule with most ambiguous care.
On vice we smile and frown,
To day protect young Virtue fair,
Tomorrow strike her down.


Build and well discipline our Schools,
Sound knowledge wide discover.
Then trespass on those simple rules,
Which link us to each other.
Enlightened Senators who feel
This evil?and deplore,
May your philantrophy and zeal.
Be seen in something more.
ECONOMY a change demands,
? JUSTICE? cries ? fie for shame!?
? Honour? exclaims ?? go wash your hands
From this offensive stain I?
Grapes are not gathered from the thorn,
Nor figs grow on the thistle,
And those who common wisdom scorn.
Pay dearly for their whistle.
Blind he must be who will not see,
The progress of the foe,
No man is he ?who would he free,
Yet fear to strike the blow.
While revenue from crime is made.
The country will repent it,
Or while her Ministers are paid
To punish?not prevent it.
If drainage, lighting, rails and roads,
The tramway, ?bus or cab act,
V *
Be subjects worthy legal codes,
(Nor less important scab act.)


If we may legislate for sheep,
And such distempers scan,
Is it not criminal to sleep,
O?er this disease in MAN.
Why should we ever crouch and bend.
So piteously to pelf,
And all our efforts rise and end,
? Uplifting Little Self.?
Observe the patriotic plan,
In good old times presented.
Raise and befriend your fellow man,
Bv licensed thieves tormented.
? Take care of him??nor shun his claim,
(As did a Levite creeper,)
Look at his wounds, and then exclaim
? Am I my brothers keeper
Be ye courageous, by degrees,
The plague may haply cease,
The dictates of your conscience please,
And the result ?be peace.
And if this sketch so feebly shown,
Be truthfully depicted,
The LICENSE has Licentious grown,
And ought to be restricted.
And thus we close our plaintive strain,
For length apologise,
To find they?ve not been wrote in vain,
Will gratefully surprise.


(�p
Let some restrictive act be don*,
- Though difficult to do.
No victory was nobly won,
Which not a struggle knew.
feo now with all respect profound.
We bow the usual way,
And ever fee I in duty bound.
Tor your success to pray.
