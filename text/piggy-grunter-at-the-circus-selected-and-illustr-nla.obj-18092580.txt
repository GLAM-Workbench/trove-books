4\ GRUNTER
CIRCUS
PIGGY
at the
Piggy Grunter was l"he most excited pig in the
whole world. His father, Mr. Grunter, had worked
very hard for a long time and saved up enough
f
money to buy a Circus.
"I shall be the Ring Master," said Mr. Grunter,
"and wear a top hat and crack a whip!"
"And I shall dress up like a Clown and do
tricks on my bicycle," cried Piggy, clapping his
hands.
Mrs. Grunter was pleased, too.
I have always enjoyed going to the Circus,
she said, and now I shall go every day! I shall
put on my best dress and sit in the front row.

and clap all the per-
formers. But I'll clap
hardest when Piggy is
doing his tricks on his
bicycle!
Pi99y got out his
bicycle and cleaned the
wheels and polished the
handlebars. His mother
made him a fine Clown s
suit and a Clown's cap,
and Piggy tried them
on in front of the mirror
in his mother s bedroom.
You look just like a
real Clown!' cried Mrs.
Grunter. You will be the Star Turn of the Circus!'
Mr. Grunter was very busy for a long
time, getting the big tent put up, and hiring


Page 6
all the animals to take part in his Circus, but
at last everything was ready.
"We must have a grand procession
through the town,” said Mr. Crunter, "and then
everyone will want to come to the Circus tonight.
So all the animals put on their Circus costumes,
and there was a splendid procession. Everyone
came out to look at it. They leaned out of the
windows and hung over the fences and climbed up
the telegraph poles to get a better view. They
shouted and laughed and cheered as the pro-
cession went through the town.
First came the Band. They all looked very
fine in their new uniforms with brass buttons on
the coats. The Band Master marched in front, and
there were big letters painted on the drum
GRUNTER'S CIRCUS.
Then came the ponies, stepping high, and the


Page 7
big horses with rib-
bons in their manes,
and all the other
animals who were
taking part. Esme-
relda, the Elephant,
was there, waving
a beautiful red rose
in her trunk, and
Gerald, the Giraffe,
was wearing a gar-
land of flowers
round his neck. And last of all came
Mr. and Mrs. Crunter in their big red car
with Piggy sitting up beside his mother, looking
very fine in his Clown's suit.
The policeman at the corner put up his hand
to stop the traffic and let the procession go past,
and Mr. and Mrs. Crunter and Piggy waved to all


their friends. It was the finest procession that
had ever been seen in the town, and almost
everyone decided to go to the Circus that night.
There was such a crowd that the ticket man
had to send out for some more tickets, and Mr.
Crunter had to rush out and buy some more seats so
that everyone could fit in. The Band was playing,
and little pigs in red suits went through the crowd
selling ice-creams and peanuts—and then at last,
when everything was ready, Mr. Crunter went out
into the middle of the Ring and cracked his whip.
The Circus had begun!
It was a marvellous Circus.
First came the Hogg Brothers, who did all sorts
of tumbling and acrobatic tricks. They turned
somersaults and Catherine wheels, and stood on
each others shoulders.
Then the Band played a lively tune, and the
ponies trotted out into the Ring. They looked

splendid, with little silver bells on their harness,
and their long manes and tails flying as they gal-
loped round and round. They formed-fours, and
waltzed, and did all sorts of clever things-and
then the Band played louder than ever, and Topsy
Bacon, the beautiful Trick Rider, galloped on, riding
the fastest pony of all.
She wore a lovely
frilled skirt, and did all
sorts ot tricks on the
pony s back. She stood
on one toe and blew
kisses to the crowd,
and then she jumped
off and on while the
pony went round and
round. Everyone clap-
ped and cheered. They
had never seen such
a good rider as Topsy
Bacon!

Then came Jerry, the Juggler, riding on top of
Esmerelda, the Elephant. He was throwing a dozen
balls up into the air at once, and catching


/ '"'x
Page 12
them again, without dropping one. He did all sorts
of tricks with balloons and plates and long sticks
and Esmerelda helped him, catching the plates
in her trunk and throwing them back to Jerry,
the Juggler, again.
The crowd clapped and cheered and cried:
"More! More!" but Mr. Crunter came out into the
Ring and cracked his whip and shouted:
"Tilly and Milly, the Tight-Rope Twins!"
The band played softly while Tilly and Milly
walked and danced on the
tight-ropes. They carried
little umbrellas, and there
was a big net stretched
out underneath to catch
them if they should fall.
But they were so good
at balancing that they
didn t even wobble !


Page 13
Next came Hambo, the Strong Man. He
had great big muscles in his arms and his
back and his legs, and he lifted heavy weights
marked 200 lbs. and balanced a ball filled with
lead on his forehead. The crowd cheered and
clapped again and shouted:
Bravo ! Bravo ! Hambo !'
And then it was time for the INTERVAL.
The lights went on all over the tent. Everyone
talked and laughed and ate ice creams and looked
at their programmes to see what was coming next,
and they saw written in big letters:
NEXT ITEM: STAR TURN: PIGGY CRUNTER
DOING TRICKS ON HIS BICYCLE.
Mrs. Crunter smiled and folded her hands as
the lights went out again and Mr. Crunter came
out into the Ring and cracked his whip. He
shouted very loudly:


Page 14
The next item is PIGGY CRUNTER!
But-oh dear! Where was Piggy Crunter?
In all the excitement of getting ready, trying
on his Clowns costume and polishing his bicycle
and riding in the procession, there was one thing
Piggy hadn't done. He was rather a lazy little pig
really, and he hated practising anything, and so
he hadn t practised any of his tricks! Not one!
And now the Circus was in full swing -his
name was on the programme-he was all dressed
up in his Clown s suit his bicycle was ready -
and the crowd was waiting. But Piggy was
shivering behind the curtains. He was much too
scared to go out into the Ring!
The Band played faster, and he heard his
father s voice again :
The next item is Piggy Crunter, who will do
tricks on his bicycle! But Piggy only muttered
to himself- I cant go on! I cant go on! I don't
know any tricks!


Page 15
And then he felt someone grip his arm. It
was Jerry, the Juggler. And Topsy Bacon was
there looking at him, and Hambo, the Strong
Man—and Tilly and Milly, the Tight-Rope Twins—and
the Hogg Brothers and there was Esmerelda,
waving her trunk at him.
Co on. Piggy!" said Jerry, the Juggler. Its
your turn!" But Piggy just stood there shivering
and shaking.
cant!" he said. I cant!
But you must!" said Jerry, the Juggler.
"Yes, you must ! said Topsy Bacon.
Yes, you MUST!" said Tilly and Milly and
the Hogg Brothers.
You cant let us down and spoil the show!
shouted Hambo, the Strong Man.

No! trumpeted Esmerelda, waving her trunk.
You can't spoil Crunter’s Circus!"


Page 17
For the third time the Band played the
music for Piggy's turn. For the third time Mr.
Crunter cracked his whip and shouted:
The next turn is PIGGY CRUNTER!
Piggy saw the anxious faces round him, he
heard their voices saying YOU MUST!”
and then the next moment he was
up in the seat of his bicycle.


Page 18
Good luck! trumpeted Esmerelda.
Good luck! cried the others. And then he
was pedalling out into the Ring and the crowd
was cheering him.
Piggy heard his father cracking his whip-
he saw his mother clapping harder than anyone
else - and he began to pedal faster and faster
round the Ring. I cant do any tricks!' he thought
wildly. What shall I do?' and at that very
moment the front wheel of his bicycle twisted,
and Piggy flew off over the handlebars. The
crowd roared with delight.
More! More ! they shouted.
Piggy scrambled back on to the saddle.
His hands were covered with sawdust and his
heart was thumping. He tried to ride sideways
and fell off again. The crowd cheered more
loudly than ever-and Piggy staggered back
into the seat. Every time he tried to do a trick

he fell off, and every time he fell off the crowd
laughed and clapped more loudly.
He s the funniest Clown Ive ever seen!
gasped Mr. Porker, who was sitting next to Mrs.
Crunter.
He s the Star Turn! said his mother proudly.

Battered and bruised and covered with
sawdust. Piggy still kept pedalling round and
round the Ring. The wheels of his bicycle were
wobbling now, and the handlebars were crooked.
Piggy tried to stand up on the seat—the bicycle
turned a somersault—and Piggy went flying head-


Page 21
first out through the doorway into the arms of
Hambo, the Strong Man. The curtains fell behind
him, the Band began to play the music for
another item, Mr. Crunter cracked his whip again
and the Hogg Brothers ran out to do their
second turn.
Behind the curtain Piggy was sitting on the
floor, black and blue, covered with dust, his
Clown s cap over one eye but beaming with


Page 22
pleasure, because he was surrounded by his
friends, the Circus animals, and they were
shouting:
"Bravo! You did it. Piggy!"
Then Hambo, the Strong Man, came up and
shook his hand. I've been in twenty different
Circuses, all over the world, he said, and you re
the funniest Clown Ive ever seen!
And then Esmerelda put back her head
and trumpeted:
"Three cheers for Piggy Crunter!" and they
all joined in:
THREE CHEERS FOR PIGGY CRUNTER!
