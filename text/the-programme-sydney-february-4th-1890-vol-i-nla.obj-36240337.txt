| WHY PROTECTION IS NEOSSAEY
IN THIS ODR YOUNG AND
RISING COUNTRY,
, A woman of poor circumstances was
left alone to rear and educate a family of
four, their ages ranging from 10 to 16
years. Being four boys the mother asked
her neighbours the best thing to do to
enable her family to earn their livelihood,
and be of use to her in her old days. The
reply was that if they learned a trade it
would be of very little use in this free-
trade colony. The poor widow struggled
hard to make a living for herself and
children by taking in washing and sewing
and, in fact, anything in which she could
acquire an honest sixpence. Meanwhile
the boys grew up, and after being fairly
well educated, were taught trades, viz.,
carpenter, upholsterer, polisher, etc. The
boys are now strong young men, and,
being out of their apprenticeship, are un-
fortunately discharged and thrown on
their own resources, being totally unable
to gain employment at their respective
trades, owing of course to our free-trade
policy. What is to become of those boys,
likewise hundreds of others and the
rising generation, unless institutions are
established where a young man can find
employment instead of allowing tons of
foreign merchandise to flood our market 1
We wonder if the foreign traders will
contribute towards our institutions and
benevolent asylums (which are already
overcrowded), and assist the needy who
claim the privileges which they enjoy
through this free-trade policy. A. B.
PYKE, the Furniture King of Pitt Street,
has mechanics on his premises who can
turn out furniture as well, in fact, better
than the imported trash

approach to a swallow-tailed coat.

Harlequinade.
The sixth and” last week of the Panto-
mime has arrived. During its,jsuccessful
career the interpretation of *the several
characters was equal to thatrequirements
and its interests. Visitors have been en-
chanted by the scenery and surrounding
auxiliaries which have been brought to
bear upon it. In these spectacular days
the story which is supposed to be realized
in Pantomime, is a matter of second rate
importance. Splendid costumes, scenery*
properties, etc., are the stock-in-trade of
the pantomime in these degenerate times.
In “ Aladdin ” there are numbers of fine
dresses, good properties, and the scenery
which is made to illustrate this legend is
of an admirable order. In the matter of
acting the annual has in many respects
much justice rendered to it. As the
“hero” Miss Jenny Lee gives evidence
of possessing those good qualities which
are eminently serviceable in pantomime,
gives importance to her lines, and sings
and dances well. Mr. George Walton as
the Widow Twaukey is happily oast, and
Mr. Slade Murray as the “ Emperor ” in
his comic songs is never iu-“ Sultan.”
Fred, Dark as the wicked magician in-
vested the part with character and
individuality. The other parts were
creditably rendered. The names of a
host of other performers who rendered
good assistance in the pantomime, our
limited space will not permit us even to
mention. Mr. John Wallace’s skill as
clown was agreeably demonstrated at an
advanced period of the evening. Mrs.
Frances Hodgson Burnett’s dramatic
version of her story “ Little Lord Faun-
tleroy,” which is conceded by managers
to be the great popular rage in England,
America, and Melbourne, will be produced
here on Saturday next. We have received
from Mr. George Wotherspoon the man-
ager for Little Lord Fauntleroy, an
illuminated piece of music composed by
himself and dedicated to the authoress of
the play as a souvenier of the visit of
Governor and Countess Hopetoun to the
Princess’s Theatre, Melbourne, on the
ofcasioif of the fiftieth representation of
the play.

Notice of Removal.
Messrs. Hollway and Carter,
Dentists, have removed to 228 Eliza-
beth-street, (ten doors from late
address.) Hours of attendance :
9.30 to 5 ; Saturdays, 9.30 to 1.
There is some talk of Mr. Irving
buying out that enterprising publican
whose premises adjoin the Lyceum,
and whose side-door” tactics—
though perfectly legitimate—cause
the pittites of the theatre to rage so
furiously. This really seems the only
course open to the popular lessee, who
has tried expostulation in vain, and
who is much annoyed at the incon-
venience his patrons experience.
It is rumoured that Miss Mary
Anderson will shortly be married.
She has taken another house at Hamp-
stead, and the very extensive pur-
chases she has been making at some
of the most important West-end
shops would lead one to believe that
“ Our Mary ” has at length decided
to imitate her friend Sara Bernhardt
and try her luck in the matrimonial
lottery.
Insist upon being supplied with the cele-
brated “ Dawn ” Cigar, their excellent
quality has been fully proved, and they
are amongest the best Cigars imported.
There is a type of individual who ii
constantly trying to find out those
employes with grievances. Experience
tells us that most wage-earners believe
themselves not too well treated, and a
very little persuasion will convince them
that they are quite badly used. That the
condition of such persons is not amelio-
rated by the interference of these so-called
philanthropists, who, if he does nothing
else, is always most successful in sowing
disaffection and bringing about between
master and man such relations as ought
not to exist. The working stage hands
of the Theatre Eoyal are like a hippy
family, and they have their periodical
sports for which valuable prizes are con-
tested. Last week one of these events
took place. A number of performers who
at one time looked at the matter as a bit
of fun now regard it au serieux. and
doubtless for weeks previous deliberately
undergo a process of preparation which
involves much self-abnegation. After the
performance on Monday night of the
pantomime, a few friends and press met
in the property room to witness the dis-
tribution of the prizes. Mr. G. L. Good-
man was unanimously voted in the chair;
he apologised for the absence of Mr, J. C.
Williamson, who having a business
appointment was unable to be present.
After a slight repast, the health of Her
Majesty the Queen, the Governor, and the
Firm were heartily drank. Mr. B. W.
Boyce proposed Mr. G. L. Goodman’s
health in eulogistic terms, to which an
excellent response was given. Mr. G.
Walton proposed the employes , stating
that in his English theatrical experience
no better stage hands he had'eve" met.
The toast of the Press was responded to by
representatives of the Bulletin, Star and
Programme. Mr. Goodman distributed
the prizes to the fortunate winners,
accompanying the bestowal of each trophy
with a kind word of encouragement. Mr.
Burns and the heads of various depart-
ments responsible for the direction of
these sports deserve uvery praise for the
arrangements. Some excellent songs, and
a recitation added greatly to the enjoy-
ment of the company.
Mr. Charles Huenerbein, the well-known
Pianoforte Importer, is now showing a
splendid collection of the best pianos, in-
cluding the celebrated John Brinsmead
and Son’s pianos which received gold
medals at principal exhibitions, legion of
honour 1883, Royal Portugese Knighthood,
Diploma of Honour, and gold medal

Mr, Charles Huenerbein is sole agent.

JDMTHAH BRADFORD,
Or the Murder at the Roadside Inn.
This original Drama is founded on Real Facts. Jonathan Bradford actually
kept an Inn on the London Road to Oxford, and bore an unexceptionable
character. The extraordinary affair which led to the construction of this
Drama was the conversation of the whole county. The innocent and unfortun-
ate Landlord, accused of a cruel murder, perpetrated under his very roof, and
borne down by a long train of overwhelming circumstantial evidence, in vain
pleaded not guilty ; all conspired to condemn him ; his assertions were of little
avail; never was presumptive conviction more strong. There was little need
of comment from the Judge in summing up the evidence, no room appeared
for extenuation, and the Jury brought in the Prisoner Guilty, even without
going out of the box ! !

Havmarket Theatre.
“Jonathan Bradford,” an old Surrey
Theatre melo-drama, was played by a very
capable company comprising Mr. William
South who is retained for the title role . Mr.
Charles Burford in his original character
Dan Macraisy, Miss Minnie Howard who
plays Mrs. Bradford, and other well-known
names including Messrs. J. Hasker, G.
Gardiner, A. Cargo, A. Anderson. C. Fo?s,
Mrs. Barry I ane, and others. The drama
finds favour with the public. The situa-
tions are contrived with very considerable
ingenuity, and there is no want of skill
in the trea’ment of chaiacter, the parts
having been judiciously distributed to
suit the capabilities of the various mem-
beis of. tne company whose efforts were
warmiy and deservrdly applauded. The
scene of the murder in the roadside inn.
( taking into consideration the limited
resources of the stage, was most adroitly
I managed ; the real culprit is discovered
in time to al’ow dramatic justice to be
dealt 1 oth to the innrcent ind the guilty.
V> e wish 4hq enterprise every success, and
hope Mr, Barr will be enabled to keep
open permanently his theatie devoted to
the drama, for the sake of the public and
the profession. As before mentioned,
the piece now being played is a thorough-
ly dramatic one, and its good points are
accentuated by its excellent interpretation
although it recalls the “resurrection pie”
of our younger caj, s. Mr. Tom Buckley
appears in the afterpiece.
