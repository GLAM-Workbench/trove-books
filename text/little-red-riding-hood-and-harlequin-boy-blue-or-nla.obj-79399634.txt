Steam Navigation Company,
XjXZMZTTEJD.
This Company?s Fleet consists of
some Thirty Steamers, which have been
specially built for the Australian Trade,
and are unequalled for speed, comfort,
and ventilation, and passenger accom-
modation.
Most of the Steamers are fitted with
Cool Deck Cabins, so necessary to the
Queensland Climate, and to avoid over-
crowding the State Rooms contain only
two berths.
Special attention is given to the Pro-
vidoring Department, which is unsur-
passed by even those of the Great English
Steam Lines. The Passenger Steamers
have lately been fitted throughout with
the Electric Light.
For particulars of Fares and Freights,
and all other information connected with
the A.U.S.N. Co., apply to the undersigned
or the duly authorised Agents at other

Spiders discovered?enter Wolf.
Wolf (recit.) Wake, friendly spiders, cunning to devise
Soft, silky snares, for unsuspecting flies ;
Lend me your aid, to work my wolfish schemes,
With gory plans untold, my noddle teems.
Weave snares round every flower in the wood,
For I have sworn to kill Red Riding Hood.
Spider Chorus.
We all swear to lend our aid,
If our services are paid ;
Stealthy cords we?ll weave around her,
For an enemy we?ve found her.
We are foes to all that?s good,
So we hate Red Riding Hood.
Wolf Though I?m a wolf, I have a brother, who
Is older?most think plainer?of the two ;
He is a Baron, very fierce and grim,
And I have no relations ?bar-on ? him.
He wants my aid against Red Riding Hood,
I swore that I would help him if I could;
He?s in some mess about her father?s will,
So with your help I?ll her and her grandma kill.
Enter Progress, Patience and Perseverance.

A blow at Progress nearly always fails.

Advance Australia ! is their motto still.

Progress. Go, crafty fiend of law, red tape and costs,
You and your friends?by all the mighty frosts ?
I?ll strike with magic, and a fairy curse,
I?ll, I?ll, make you honest!
All Nothing could be worse.
Progress. He, who my wand shall touch.
Be he who he may,
An upright man is such,
And honest from this day.
Patience. Come, Progress, let them go, their power is
nought,
Perseverance. The threats of cowards are not worth a
thought.
Patience. Don?t waste your time upon such worthless
cases, ,
Progress. For honesty would never suit such faces.
Exit Progress, Patience, and Perseverance.
Fox. A narrow squeak.
Wolf. Our plans now push along,
Fox. Australian progress is a foe so strong;
Turn honest, tell the truth, and never swindle,
To insignificance my fame would dwindle.
Ist Spider. Red Riding Hood is not Australian
though,
You might at her strike a successful blow,
For she?s so simple, falls in love with flowers,
Wolf. And fondles stupid birds and things for hours,
Ist Spider. So neat and clean she tidies up her room,
And tears my cobwebs with broom.
Fox. Come, you can help, you have some venom keen,
That which you use for killing flies I mean.
Wolf. On her grandmother ?you give that a trial,
Disguised like patent med?cine in a phial ;
Fox, Cures everything, if you will only try it,
Except the one complaint for which you buy it.
Just tell her grandma that it?s anti-fat,
Ist Spider. The spider is quite fly enough for that.
In the girl?s garden I will make my nest,
Destroying all the things she loves the best;
I?ll kill the plants which in her bough pots grow,
Defying industry to make a show. ,
Fox. And I will help you to achieve your ends,
But don?t forget, the girl has many friends,
Wolf. The more the merrier? I?ll eat the lot.

All. But this, you understand,
Was before we joined the band ;
We?ve given up the day so palmy,
This dance is free from guile,
And quite the latest style
Of knee drill, for we learned it in the Army.
Baron. 1 now go and preach on Sunday after dinner,
Quite regularly down in the Domain.
Simple Simon. And I sweetly sing a welcome to the
sinner,
Accompanied by concertina strain.
Fox. I take round the hat?and though I?m a be-
ginner,
A comfortable livelihood we gain.
All. For tambourine in hand
We lead the noisy band.
Perhaps you think our antics barmy,
But still we find it pays.
This is the latest craze,
The war dance, all the fashion in the Army.
Dance and exit.
Enter Damk.
Dame. (Ist dog under arm). Well, what?s up now
Oh, I know. First of May,
Nice goings on. What is this ? Botany Bay r
There used to be a custom long ago
Of seeking out a May Queen, as you know
I never was the Queen, though often near,
Perhaps they will elect me though this year.
Those children drive me mad. Boys of to-day
Spend all their time at football and such play,
They don?t learn manners, call me old indeed ;
I own that twice I?ve worn the widow?s weed.
My first was Duncan Lochinvar Macbeth,
The villain swore I talked him clean to death.
My second was English, and a perfect toff,
He was so often on, that drink took him off.
(He came from London but drank Scotch whisky
till he was naturalised).
I?m still a simple girl of forty one,
And older girls than me, have lots of fun.
In our days the age of any maid
Depends upon how thick the paint is laid.

Q
My name?s Mac Pan itch, of the bluest blood,
An ancestor of mine was at the flood ;
He drifted out here at some early day,
And settled somewhere near to Botany Bay.
I came from Scotland, tho?; I?m not Colonial,
At home my family is quite Baronial,
1 thought to make a fortune here somehow ;
J didn?t know much of mining?l know all about
it now
Song? ?l KNOW ALL ABOUT IT. NOW.?
Exit.
Enter Green.
Green. Ma will be pleased, I?ve sneaked this pot of
jam,
She says I am a villain, so I am. m
What can I torment ? Ah, here comes the cat.
Enter Cat.
Here puss, puss.
Oh ! I?ll pay you out for that.
I?ve got you now, and down the well I?ll, throw
you.
When you come out, your mother wouldn?t know
you.
Enter Stout.
Stout. Ah there, 1 saw you Mr Johnny Green,
I?ll go and tell old Grannie what I?ve seen ;
Coward to strike a poor defenceless cat.
Green. Defenceless, ah ? What do you think of that ?
Stout, Those awful cries, they cut me like a knife,
I?ll rescue her altho? I risk my life.
Green. Say, Johnny Stout, I?m going to run away
Stout. From pussy ?
Green. No. From school, this very day.
Let?s be like Norsemen in the days of old.
Stout, What did they do?
Green. They all were pirates bold.
Stout. All right, I?m. on,
Green. Your hand, the compact?s sealed,
Both. We swear to do or die, but never yield,
Stout. I?ve got a penny, have you got anything,
Green. Yes, a toy pistol and a bit of string ;
Stout. I?ve got a com or two I never part with.

Green. All right, you see we?ve got enough to start
with.
Stout. Swear to be faithful to the skull and bones,
Blind to all blood and deaf to sighs and groans.
Swear to treat all, no matter how they scream,
As tho? they had devised the contract scheme,
If gas commissioners for mercy sue,
Light up their gas and then they?ll all look blue.
Green. You swear.
Stout. Sometimes I do.
Green. Since that?s the case
I think you?ll very likely suit the place.
Stout. When do we start.
Green. At once ;
Don?t tremble so.
Stout. I?m not, but it?s so chilly here you know,
Sh?Shall we run any risk of being hurt.
Green. You?re built for a special bobby, that a cert.
Before we start let?s us have a jolly day.
Cheer up! and let?s be merry while we may ;
Come! and I?ll let you see a thing or two,
The place for fun is sunny Woolloomooloo.
Exit Stout and Granny.
Enter Bed Riding Hood.
Song.
Red Riding Hood. Of course you know my name?s
Red Riding Hood,
And in these parts it?s always understood
That I?m the fairest maiden and the best,
And altogether nicer than the rest.
I can?t find Granny, seek her as I will,
She left home early, all got up to kill,
I know she?s somewhere here, I heard her say
That she was bent on being Queen of May.
She told me where to find her?l forget, it?s true,
But I can?t think of everything, really, can you?
?YOU CANT THINK OF EVERYTHING.?
I have just forgot the title of the song I ought to sing,
But you can?t think of everything.
The music was delightful, and went with such a swing,
But you can?t think of everything.

r J'he man from whom I bought it said lie wanted money
down,
I said that he would have to wait until I came to town,
I?ve forgotten his address, or I?d have sent him every
brown,
But you can?t think of everything, can you
Chorus.
It s so easy to forget a little thing like that,
You can?t remember every little thing, that?s flat.
My memory is bad, though you may think it?s not,
I?d have sent the man the money, but I quite forgot.
Last night I had some strawberries and cream
For supper, and it must have made me dream?
-1 thought some horrid spiders bound me tight
With cobweb ropes, it gave me such a fright ;
And as I lay all helpless on the ground
f heard a fearful howling kind of sound,
I turned my head, and standing by my side
I saw a wicked wolf, jaws open wide,
Just going to eat me?e?er he?d time to start
A fairy arrow' struck him to the heart; ?
And there, upon the bank, he fell and died,
Then fairies came and all my bonds untied.
Then came the sweetest thing I ever knew'?
A wondrous vision of a boy in blue.
Enter Bose.

Yet I could dream for ever for his sake ;

Red Riding Hood. Please, are you real ?
Boy Blue. . Are you just what you seem 1
Red Riding Hood. (Who is it I w'onder?) I?l think
I?m just a vision ! -
Boy Blue. I?m a dream.
I fell asleep, sweet maid, and dream of you ;
Red Riding Hood. That?s strange, because I think
I?m dreaming too.

Red Riding Hood. Our friendship is so short?
It?s hardly proper?
-1 don't think 1 ought.
Boy Blue. Don?t let those pretty eyes with anger ?
gleam,
Remember, dear, we?re only in a dream
Red Riding Hood. Ft?s all right, I suppose ?
Boy Blue. All right? It?s perfect bliss.
Red Riding Hood. When I?m awake you know, I don?t
do things like this.
Boy Blue, Were I awake my distance 1 should keep.
You can?t help what you do when you?re asleep.
Red Riding Hood. No, folks would think us fast if
this were real.
Boy Blue, How lovely dreamland kisses make you
feel.
Red Riding Hood. If] were not asleep I?d be offended
Boy Blue. Your anger, love, would only be pretended.
I know you love me?promise to be true,
When dreams are over to your own Boy Blue,
Say you?ll be mine for life?for good or ill.
Red Riding Hood. It?s rather sudden, darling, but I
At such a short acquaintance, I?m afraid
You?ll think that I?m a very forward maid
Boy Blue, In real life you might think me forward too,
I n dreams it does?nt matter what you do.
Duet? ?lF WE WERE AWAKE.?
Written by Bert Royle. Music by Lovell Phillips.
Red Riding Hood. I never dream when I?m awake
Of doing things like this.
Boy Blue. ?Twould be a liberty to take
Of course to steal a kiss.
Red Riding Hood. On such a short acquaintance we
Might bow?or even smile.
Boy Blue. I wouldn?t think of making free
In this improper style.
Chorus.
Red Riding Hood. You may kiss me as we?re dreaming
(kiss, kiss, kiss).
Boy Blue. In your eyes true love is beaming.
(kiss, kiss, kiss).

Red Riding Hood. Must our hearts at waking sever?
Is it wrong to love like this ?
Boy Bine. Darling let us sleep for ever,
Living on a dreamland kiss.
Red Riding Hood. In real life this is never done,
?Twould be considered bold
Boy Blue. Though you?re in love with anyone
You must be prim and cold.
Red Hiding Hood. They never spoon, you know, or
flirt;
So forward it would seem?
Boy Blue. And yet the poets all assert
That life is but a dream.
Chobus.
Red Riding Hood. He?s gone?but I shall find him?
for he said
? None but Red Riding Hood I?ll ever wed.?
Chorus.
Now, the girl who?s fairest, must be crowned the
Queen of May,
Each girl thinks she ought to be, at least so people
say;
All the boys who love us, now can show their love is
true,
But choosing one and vexing none, is hard to do.
Eater Baron, Simple Simon, Granny, Stout, etc.
Baron. My friends I gather?so do you?we?ve met
To crown the prettiest girl that we can get;
Well there?s no harm?don?t think that I?m
objecting,
In fact I?ll stop and join in the inspecting.
Horner. Thanks, friends, for this reception ; Christmas
pies
Are now in season?so I?m free to rise
And leave my corner just to make things hum,
I?ve been to Broken Hill?but found no plum.
Baron. The Statue is the place for that oration,
Let?s get to business ?any nomination ?
Horner. Little Miss iMuffit is my sweetheart true,
And her I beg to nominate to you.
Miss Muflit, I rather think you?ll find me hard to beat.

Q
Dame. I?ll see to that. Where?s all your pluck gone
to ?
There?s only one word you can say, boo-hoo.
You?re like a lot who would be M?s. L. A.,
They promise lots before the polling day ;
But once elected, they?re not half so bold,
They have to do exactly as they?re told.
Enter Simple Simon and Silly Billy.
Dame. Come in, Silly Billy,
Silly Billy. Please, teacher, I come to ask if I can
come,
Dame. Why did?nt you come yesterday ?
Silly Billy. Please I had to take care of mother.
Dame. Why not the day before ?
Silly Billy 1 had to take the canary to the black-
smith?s to get a tooth pulled.
Green. Goal for North.
Dame. Go to your places, every pupil to his seat,
The Baron is approaching with his suite;
He?s going to give the prizes, so prepare,
And p?raps he?ll shout you to his fancy fair.
Enter all the children , Red Riding Hood, Boy Blue,
and Baron.
Baron. Eh?em?eh! This is the proudest moment of
my life,
These early prizes won in worldly strife,
Are nothing to the prizes you may win
If you will persevere and not give in.
Is that the kind of thing I ought to say 1
Dame. Oh, splendid, pray go on.
Baron. Sweet, I obey.
Who takes the prize for needle work?
Dame. Let?s see,
Give that to Mary Mary.
Mary Mary. Please, that?s me.
Baron. Your liberal teacher gives you nothing less
Than a paper pattern for a baby?s dress.
Prize for housekeeping, little Polly Flinders,
A broom and pan for brushing up the cinders
You draw so well my pretty Miss Bo Peep,
You?ve drawn a winner in Tattersall?s big sweep
The prize for being amiable and good
Is won by our young friend Red Riding Hood.

The best of all the prizes, ?tis by far,
A first-class billet in a private bar.
I see there?s something here about Boy Blue,
There ought to be a prize, 1 think, for you;
It must have been mislaid, or lost, 1 fear,
At any rate I?m sure it isn?t here.
1 promised some free passes, as you know,
To see my fancy fair and Christmas show;
They?re only for good children, understand,
They don?t let bad?ens into dolley?s land.
Here, dearie,
And Red Riding Hood there?s one for you,
And one of course for that good lad Roy Blue;
These tickets all include the steamer too.
Dame. Get me a berth that is?nt near the screw,
I?m such a shocking sailor, never well,
Until 1 hear the lunch or dinner bell.
Stout. What?s to become of us? ain?t we to go 1
Dame. Such naughty boys as you? good gracious, no!
Stout. We?ll see to that! here, boys, let?s grab their
passes,
Dame Well, what a lot of forward lads and lasses?
Baron. They?ve collared mine as well, and I declare,
I haven?t got a bean to pay my fare.
Red Riding Hood, What?s to be done ?
Baron. I can at any rate
Ring up the telephone and stop ?em at the gate.
Red Riding Hood. I?m very disappointed,
Boy Blue. So am I.
Enter Rose.
Dame. I?m so cut up that really 1 could cry.
Rose. Don?t be down hearted friends,
Dame. You?ve heard and seen,
Rose. Of course 1 have, for I?m the fairy queen.
Dame. You don?t say? That old yarn won?t wash
you know,
I thought your race had died out long ago.
Rose. You?re wrong you see?my little favourite here
Would like to see the fair, is that so dear ?
Red Riding Hood. Oh, very much, and so would my
Boy Blue.
And if it?s not too much, old Granny too,

Progress. All?s going well; our foes are held at bay,
The tale?s progressing in the usual way.
I must be careful, though, and not forget
Red Riding Hood?s not out of danger yet.
Enter Queen Rose.
Rose. The Wolf and Fox are plotting in the wood,
To snare and overthrow Red Riding Hood.
Progress. Then go and gather all your fairy band
And join me in the dell,
Rose. I understand.
Progress. We?ll meet them face to face.
Rose. At once, I?ll go.
When we are ready I will let you know.
Rose.
Progresss. I'll gather all who ?neath my banner fight.
And with confusion all the knaves we?ll smite.
SCENE 2.
Riding Habit Ballet, and Exit.
Opening Chorus.
While the old folks at home gather round the cheery
hearth,
Holly and mistleto hung all around,
We wander along the dear old woodland path,
In the bright South when the Christmas bells sound.
The boys and the girls are all billing and cooing,
Bright glances aie darting from soft roughish eyes,
For everyone knows its the season for wooing,
The temple of love is beneath the blue skies.

Miss Muffitt. How dare you say a thing that isn?t true.
Horner. I rather thought the truth would aggravate
Miss Muffitt. Oh, go away and leave me, for I hate you.
Horner. This is a jolly sort of picnic, this is.
Miss Muffitt. Well, don?t you be so free, then, with
your kisses.
Horner (aside). I?ll make her think that I dislike and
scorn her.
{A loud) .
I?m off to eat my mince pie in a corner.
Miss Muffitt. Well, go away, and stay away all day ;
Here on this tuffit, with my curds and whey
I?ll be quite happy.
Horner, Very well, I?m gone.
Good-bye. ( Exit .)
Miss Muffitt. Good day. And now I?m all alone.
The nasty, horrid, hateful, darling boy,
It?s only just for fun that I annoy.
Now for a sweet repast of curds and whey,
In peace and comfort eat them now I may.
Here, on this tuffit, I can find a seat,
Theprettiest little lunch room one could meet.
Oh! What a horrid sight now meets my eyes,
Fancy a Spider coming from the flies.
Exit, with Chorus.
Stout. We?ve been and gone and done it, have we not;
We?re pirates now, a thoroughly bad lot.
Green We?re enemies of all the human race.
Stout. You?ll find that I?m a regular hard case.
Duet.
Green. That ticket-grabbing seals the Baron?s fate ;
The cheek of him to stop us at the gate.
Stout. To pay him out shall be my special charge.
Green. We?ll have revenge upon the world at large.
Stout. Ah, here?s an enemy, and chance of plunder.
Green. What shall we gain by this attack, I wonder,
Stand and deliver ! Money or your life !!
Simple Simon. I?ve got no money.

The charms of life till I was charmed by you,
For now the flowers are prettier than of old,
The heavens are brighter and the earth less cold;
And all because I?m loved ; it really seems
The only true world lies in lovers? dreams.
Boy Blue. Don?t say it lies, although I own, forsooth,
It doesn?t very often tell the truth
Yes, dear, you?re right, the sweetest time in life
Is just before you make a girl your wife.

Following sweet Red Riding Hood,
Carefully o?er her safety guarding.

Dame. Go on ! what are you giving us 1
Baron. Well, it?s a fact.
TOPICAL DUET.
Written by Bert Royle. Music by Lovell Phillips.
Baron, My love, you?re looking very white.
Dame. I didn?t get a wink of sleep last night.
Baron Was that you whistling, I thought I heard.
Dame. Don?t you be frightened it was just my bird.
The burglars disturbed me very early,
And left the place all in a hurly burly.
I?m such a nervous girl, I?m quite unstrung.
Baron. Yes, most of ?em are timid when they?re young
Baron Ah ! take another dose of physic pet
Dame. I haven?t taken any of it yet,
I know it?s poison, for it killed my cat,
I know you too you wretch, get out of that.
Baron. It?s medicine ! ! and drink it now you shall,
Or else I?ll use this dagger, now my girl.
Dame. Have mercy, gentle Baron, let me live,
All my possessions I will freely give,
I never did you any harm
Now you just drink,
The medicine you gave you missing link.
Baron. Put down that dagger.
Dame. Drink the poison then, ; .
Baron. Ta ta, my darling, till we meet again, {exit.)
Dame. Just look at that; he?s got away scot free !
Well, never mind ; you bet he?ll hear from me.

jf* For I?m determined soon to try my luck,

>> Red Riding Hood. Oh, dear Boy Blue, I thought we k.
j_l should be killed,
j When all those demons Oranny?s cottage filled.
How brave you were ; I am sure that but for you
Q They would have murdered us, the thieving crew.

Stout. That?s very true,
They never get much further than a clue.
Green. I can?t get food enough to keep me warm.
Stout. Well, I vote we all chuck it and reform ;
Let?s try a high-toned game, and one that pays,
Green Yes, let?s be blooming bloated M.L.A.?s.
Hallo, here comes the Baron,
Enter Baeon.
Baron, What are you still at large
As a reformer, I must give you all in charge.
Green. We?re honest now.
Stout. We?ve chucked up stealing, too
Baron. I?m glad to hear it.
Enter Dame.
Dame. Just let me get at you.
1 know now why your sweetheart you would kill,
Because you robbed me when you forged that will.
Baron. Madam, that right is on your side I own,
And I admit your cash I tried to bone ;
My wickedness I don?t wish to disguise,
But I?ve repented, and apologise ;
The quality of mercy is not strained,
Forgive, and take the hand which crime has stained
Dame. Ah, well, I?ll think it over ; where?s the child ;
Until she?s found we can?t be reconciled.
She and the Boy Blue, where can the darlings be.
Enter Rose and Progress.
Rose. That information you shall have from me,
They?re safe and sound, so you need have no fear.
Progress. And at this moment they are coming here.
Enter Bed Riding Hood and Boy Blue.
Red Riding Hood. Thanks to my brave Boy Blue, in
danger?s hour,
I both escaped the Wolf and Demons? power.
Boy Blue. Your thanks to Rose, the Fairy Queen, are due,
Patience and Perseverance pulled us through.
Progress, true friend to all, I thank you too.
But that?s not all; at last, I?m glad to say,
I?ve got Red Riding Hood to name the day.
I know you wish us well.
Dame. Hip ! hip !!
All. Hooray.
Enter Horner and Miss Muffitt.
Horner. I wish you both good luck, my friend, Boy Blue,
We have come to an understanding too ;
Miss Muffitt has proposed to me.

Miss Muffitt. Not I,
He said if I refused him he should die.
Dame "(to Baron). You?ll have to give your bad com-
panions o?er.
Enter Fox and Wolf.
Wolf. If you refer to me, I?m bad no more.
Fox. We?ve both reformed and chucked the days so pal my,
I lost my brush and so we joined the Army.
Dame. You mean it?
Fox and Wolf. Yes.
Paine. Good boy! give us your paw.
As you?ve reformed, of course you?ll drop the law.
Progress. Not so, I know it?s usual to paint lawyers black,
And some of them, I own, have morals rather slack.
Still don?t forget that at the legal bar,
Some noble honest gentlemen there are;
Ornaments and examples to their race,
Just in their dealings, full of kindly grace.
All. Hear, hear!
Stout. I beg to state I?m going back to school,
I look upon a Pirate as a fool.
Green. I must admit, with that I quite agree,
Fox. The sense of the remark I too can see.
Dame. That marriage is a failure I have read,
The folks who said so must be off their head ;
To point the moral, I now beg to state,
I?m just about once more to tempt my fate.
Rose. The fairies always love the marriage bell,
And in their names I beg to wish you well.
Progress. I wish you luck as well, for marriage, I confess,
Is indispensable, if Sydney would progress.
Boy Blue, We wish to be united, it is true,
But first we wish to cheer and brighten you ?
Bring back the glamour of sweet childhoood?s days,
And for reward look only to your praise.
Red Riding Hood. ?Tis surely something in this busy age,
To open once again the fairy page,
And show you pictures of the happy times
When life was all made up of nursery rhymes.
We hope our little chapter has been bright ;
We wish you luck and pleasant dreams. Good
night!
Finale.
