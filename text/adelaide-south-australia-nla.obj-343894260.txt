SOUTH AUSTRALIA
OFFICE OF THE AGENT-GENERAL FOR SOUTH AUSTRALIA:—B, VICTORIA CHAMBERS, WESTMINSTER.
FOR DISTKIBUTIOTsT GRATIS-
As the present Depression in Trade and Agriculture in Great Britain is causing many of the Small Capitalist class to
seek fields where they may find a better investment for their enterprise, it is considered expedient to place before such, a few
facts with reference to the above Colony, the information being up to latest dates and extracted chiefly from the
“ Statistical Sketch of South Australia,” by Josiah Bootiiby, Esq., C.M.G., Under Secretary and Government Statist.
AGE.
GEOGRAPHICAL POSITION.
South Australia was constituted
a British Province by Act of Par-
liament, in the year 1836, and at
that time contained an area es-
timated to be 300,000 square
miles, or 192,000,000 acres,
nearly twice and a half that of
Great Britain and Ireland. Since
that time the country known as
the Northern Territory has been
annexed, making altogether an
area of 900,000 square miles,
and forms at present the largest
British Colony. The map shows
the geographical position.
SEA COAST-PORTS.
The southern coast-line from
its peculiar configuration presents
a sea-board of over 2,000 miles
in length. Between eastern boun-
dary and Encounter Bay, west of
the mouth of the River Murray,
there are excellent shipping
places available for large vessels,
among them Port Victor, Lacepede
Bay, Guichen Bay, Rivoli Bay
and Port Mac Donnel l; westward
of Spencer’s Gulf is a succession of
secure harbours, several of large
extent, and with good anchorage for ships of
considerable tonnage. Port Lincoln, Smoky,
Denial, Venus, Streaky, and Fowler’s Bays are
important shipping places to the westward.
The coast-line is also deeply indented by
two large gulfs—the eastern, St. Vincent’s
Gulf, running inland to the northward for
eighty-five miles, and the larger, Spencer’s
Gulf, running N.N.E. towards the heart of
the Colony for 180 miles. These gulfs have
a mean breadth of thirty and fifty miles
respectively, and both taper towards their
northern ends. St. Vincents’ Gulf is
sheltered by Kangaroo Island, ninety miles
in length, which lies to the southward of it,
leaving two fine entrances, one from the
westward through Investigator’s Straits,
twenty-eight miles broad, and the other from
the eastward through Back Stairs Passage
eight miles in width.
The principal agricultural and mineral dis-
tricts of the Colony are contiguous to the two
gulfs, the shores of which are 780 miles in
length, the greater part being entirely protected
from the ocean swell. Numerous outposts and
shipping places, of which there are over fifty,
enable the settlers in the neighbourhood to
ship their produce at a very small cost, whilst
eleven of such ports being connected with the
general railway system of the Province,
produce is brought to the seaboard from the
interior at the lowest charge for land carriage.
These gulfs are divided by Yorke’s Peninsula,
some 120 miles long and 20 miles broad,
having large tracts of wheat-growing land, and
the principal seat of mining industry.
Situate on the eastern side of St Vincent’s
Gulf are the following ports :—Ports Adelaide,
Glenelg, Wakefield, Willunga, Noarlunga and
Yankalilla; and on the west or peninsular
side, shipping places at Edithburgh, Stansbury
and Ardrossan. The eastern side of Spencer’s
Gulf is supplied by ports Moonta, Wallaroo,
Broughton, Pirie and Port Augusta at the head
of the gulf, while Franklin Harbour, Tumby
Bay and Port Lincoln are on the western side
of the same gulf.
ADELAIDE,
the capital of the Colony, is situate about
five miles from the eastern shore of St Vincent’s
Gulf; and Port Adelaide, the principal port, is
about seven miles north-west from the city,
and connected therewith by rail.
GENERAL GOVERNMENT.
The Constitution granted to South Australia ;
by Her Majesty was proclaimed on the 24th
October, 1856, on which day the Queen’s assent
to the Constitution was received in the Colony.
Under that statute the Parliament consists of
two Houses, the Legislative Council and the
House of Assembly, the former being composed
of eighteen members and the latter, at that
time, of thirty-six; since that time the electoral
districts have been increased to twenty-two,
and the number of members to forty-six.
The qualification for a member of the
Legislative Council is that he shall have
attained the age of thirty years, that he is a
subject of the Queen, and that he has resided
in the Province for three years. Each member
is elected for twelve years, and every four
years the six members who have been longest
on the roll of the Council retire. The Legis-
lative Council is elected by ballot, the whole
Province forming an electoral district for that
purpose. The only qualification for a member
of the House of Assembly is that he shall be
of full age, and have been six months on the
electoral roll. The House of Assembly is
elected for three years, and is liable to disso-
lution by the Governor. Government is
carried on by six ministers, who form the
Cabinet, and who are ex officio members of the
Executive Council, advising the Crown in the
person of Her Majesty’s representative, His
Excellency the Governor of the Province.
The titles of the Ministers are : Chief
Secretary, Attorney General, Treasurer, Com-
missioner of Crown Lands and Immigration,
Commissioner of Public Works, and Minister
of Education. Each Minister has control
over several departments of the public service,
the duties of which are conducted by
permanent official heads.
LOCAL GOVERNMENT.
Local self-government was established as
far back as 1840, when the Corporation of
Adelaide was constituted. Most beneficial
results have flowed from the adoption of the
principle. Under it the people have been
taught the lesson of self-reliance, and have
cheerfully taxed themselves for the prosecution
of public works of general utility, over which the
local authorities, a Board of from five to seven
members elected by and from the ratepayers
of the District, exercise control. Although the
State supplements, pound for pound, all sums
raised and expended on public works in the
District, the Local Council have in their hands
the entire management of such expenditure,
and of all municipal affairs.
Twenty-one Corporations and 110 District
Councils have been constituted throughout
the settled districts. The total rateable value
of property at the close of the year 1878 was
£1,450,233. The usual rate declared upon
the assessment is one shilling in the pound
sterling. The revenue of these bodies
in 1878 was £192,733, and the amount ex-
pended on works of public utility, £118,594.
The
POPULATION
of South Australia at the close of 1879 was
estimated to be 260,000 souls— 124,000
females, and 136,000 males. This does not
include the Aborigines, who, in 1876, num-
bered in the settled districts 3,953. During
the past twelve years there has been a
numerical increase of population to the extent
of 85,308, or upwards of 52 per cent.
DISTRIBUTION OF POPULATION.
One of the most important facts brought
out by the census is the way in which the
population is distributed. The returns show
that eighty-five per cent, of the whole number
of the people are resident in the country dis-
tricts, and employed directly or indirectly in
the cultivation of the soil, or in the production
of mineral or pastoral wealth.
There are, in addition to the city of Adelaide
(with a present population, including the
suburbs, of over 65,000) other populous town-
ships. There are twenty-one corporate towns,
with a total population of 70,223, besides
numerous villages, with populations varying
from 200 to 700 persons.
BRITISH POPULATION.
The returns showing the birth-places of the
people indicate a steady increase in the num
ber of South Australian born, and
of British birth, as well as, in a
lesser degree, of those from British
possessions other than the United
Kingdom. The native-born ele-
ment forms 60 per cent, of the
population, the next largest class
being persons of English birth,
who form upwards of 22 per
cent.; Ireland has contributed 7
per cent.; Scotland, 4 per cent.;
and Germany, 3.5 per cent. The
various
RELIGIOUS
denominations were ascertained
at the census taken in 1876,
which showed that about 85 per
cent, were members of Protestant
churches, and the remaining 15
per cent. Roman Catholics. The
Church of England is represented
by 26 per cent.; the Wesleyans, 17
per cent.; the German Lutherans,
8 per cent.; Presbyterians, L. 1161
cent; Congregationalists,' Bible
Christians, Primitive Methodists,
and Baptists, each about 5 per
cent, of the total population.
CONJUGAL CONDITION.
There were in 1876, 33,570
married males, and 33,783 mar-
ried females. Married women ex-
ceed in number the married men in towns,
and the reverse is the case in the rural dis-
tricts, where also bachelors predominate.
The number of bachelors and widowers at
marriageable ages (all above fifteen) was
31,788, whilst the spinsters and widows num-
bered 24,217.
Very full information with regard to the
OCCUPATIONS OF THE PEOPLE
has been obtained by each census. These
returns are practically useful, as showing in
what direction the labour of the Colony is
chiefly employed. The following is a brief
summary :
Persons. Males. Females.
Professional : Persons
engaged in the General and
Local Government of the
Province ; persons in the
learned professions; persons
engaged in literature, fine
arts and sciences 3,988 2,716 1,272
Domestic ; —Persons en-
gaged in domestic offices or
duties, and of no specified
occupation; persons engaged
in entertaining and perform-
ing personal offices for man 139,665 43,128 96,537
Commercial : Persons
who buy, sell, keep, or lend
money on goods; or engaged
in the conveyance of men
and goods 8,598 8,327 271
Agricultural : Persons
engaged in farming, grazing,
and about animals 27,265 26,339 926
Industrial:—Persons en-
gaged in working and dealing
in art and mechanic produc-
tions; textile fabrics; dealing
in food and drinks ; working
and dealing in animal and
vegetable substances ; work-
ing and dealing in minerals 22,443 19,623 2,820

ductive . 11,312 10,358 954
Total of Population (cen-
sus of 1876) 213,271 110,491 102,780
Thus, it will be seen that agricultural,
pastoral, and horticultural pursuits are those
upon which the labour of the majority of the
population is bestowed, the number of per-
sons actually engaged therein being 27,265,
or upwards of 63 per cent, of those following
specified occupations.

South Australia exhibits the most striking
picture at present of farming industry, and on
the whole seems to be the place where, good
as the labourer’s condition may be elsewhere,
he has, by prudencS and industry, the best
chance of rising in the social scale, and
becoming in his turn an employer of labour.
The yeomanry who have found a home in
South Australia, and who are at once tillers
of the soil and employers of labour, are more
than any one class the real bone and sinew of
ithe Colony; and the industry which has so
j widely covered the land with farms, home-
| steads, tillage and fencing of every description
has probably never been equalled in its results
in any British colony in the same number of
years by the same amount of population. It
is by the spread of agriculture that the greatest
amount of industrial prosperity has been
(created, and the real settlement of the country
most effectually accomplished.”

Government statist, but are not yet published in
“ Boothby’s Statistics.”
3 The quantity available for export this year
‘ (1880) is estimated at 11,335,964 bushels,
I which in shippers’ measurement is 306,000
tons. With regard to the comparatively low
average yield above shewn, it must be borne
= in mind, in judging of the relative productive-
II ness of South Australia as compared with that
0 of other countries, that a great portion of the
'* land has been sown with wheat continuously
0 for many successive years without manure or
(rest, and being in the hands of small pro-
prietors, has received only the minimum of
t cultivation. This, of course, tends to reduce
the general average; but there are many dis-
tricts where farming is carried on on a large
scale, and with proper appliances, when the
yield of this cereal is from ten to fifteen bushels
els per acre beyond the average shown above.
QUALITY OF WHEAT.
As evidence of the high quality of the
South Australian grain, it may be mentioned
that the prize wheat exhibited at the agricul-
tural shows during the past ten years has
averaged 68 lbs. weight to the imperial bushel.
The highest prize for wheat was also awarded
to South Australia at the Paris Exhibition of
1878 ; the first prize was awarded it also at
the Sydney Exhibition, just closed.
Within the past ten years the acreage
cultivated under grain—wheat, barley, oats
and peas—has much more than doubled.
Under other crops—flax, hay, potatoes,
orchard, garden, vineyard, and including
fallow land —there were 240,606 acres in
1868-9, and 656,182 in 1878-9, or nearly
three times the amount of acreage. In 1858,
only eighteen years after the foundation of
the province, there were 89,945 acres of land
under wheat culture; in 1868-9, there were
533,035; and in 1879-80, no less than
1,458,096.
In 1878-9, there were also under cultivation
—hay, 218,359 acres; potatoes, 5,398 acres;
orchard, 3,574 ; garden, 4,677 ; and vineyard,
4,297.
THE WHEAT HARVEST.
Little labour is involved in gathering in
the wheat crops of South Australia. A machine
—manufactured in the Colony—called a “ strip-
per” is used. This machine, boxed in with
sheet iron, has a row of iron fingers so shaped
and fitted as to catch the wheat immediately
under the ear, and so by the forward motion
of the machine, drawn generally by three
horses, the ear is stripped from the straw and
drawn into the machine, where a drum with
beaters awaits it and thrashes the grain from
the ear, throwing it altogether to the back
part of the machine ; so that after the machine
has gone round the field it returns to the
corner from whence it started, and, folding
doors being opened behind, it discharges its
cargo of wheat cut and thrashed, the win-
nowing machine only being required to prepare
the grain for the bags into which it is deposited,
placed on a team, and carted to the nearest port
or railway station, or sold at once to the millers
and corn factors for cash. This explains the
dryness of the atmosphere, which is so much
more endurable than the humid heat prevailing
in some countries.
In a recent speech before the Royal Colonial
Institute, the Hon. C. Burney Young— a
resident for many years in South Australia—
said:—
reporting to me imperial govern- « Xhe reason why we can make it pay to grow only
ment, said : u Of all the British Colonies, ten bushels (per acre) or even less is somewhat
evident. In the first place the rent is very small.
The average price of land is only about 28s. or 30s. per
acre. It is not only a very small price, looking at it
in one particular point of view, because it is in South
Australia, but taking it in any point of view it is a
small price, and an immense boon for any man to be
able to get hold of a thousand acres of land at 30s. per
acre on which he may possibly clear the whole of his
purchase-money in a single crop, as has often been the
case. Now the reason why we can grow wheat and
sell it profitably when we only get eight or ten bushels
an acre, is that the whole cost of cultivation does not
exceed about £1 per acre. This seems a small amount,
but it is a positive fact that the whole cultivation,
including the seed, does not materially exceed £1 or a
guinea an acre. The ploughing only costs about 7s. an
acre ; the sowing and harrowing 25.; the reaping 6s.—
thanks to Ridley’s reaping machine; the winnowing
j 25.; and 4s. for seed at one bushel per acre. If the
farmer gets six bushels an acre, at ss. per bushel—3os.
an acre—which gives him a profit of 10s. an acre, even
at this very exceptionally low yield of six bushels.
If the people and the farmers of England only had
the slightest idea of the great benefit they would
derive from the land system if they went to South
Australia—could they but realise the advantages—l
feel convinced they would flock there in thousands.”
The advantages to the small capitalist are
apparent in the system of settling up the
Crown Lands of South Australia. It will be
seen that there is no room for middle-men,
land companies, and the like stepping betwixt
the Government and the purchaser, who buys
it at first cost. Also, not the least important
feature is the going up into the new country in
numbers, which is necessitated by the laws
affecting the settlement and sale of the land.
The Government make the main hard road to
the new township, which finds employment
for the spare time of the needy settlers ; the
town lots are purchased and built upon and
tenanted by shopkeepers of all kinds induced
by the flow of settlers ; churches and schools
are built, and in a few months the notion of
living in the “back country” is effaced by all
the amenities of civilization being established
in the centre of a thriving agricultural com-
munity. The “iron horse” and electric wire
follow in the wake very speedily, the colony,
with a population of only 250,000, possessing
already up to October 1879, 540 miles of rail-
way open for traffic; in addition to which
there are upwards of 400 miles in construction.
There are 1,219 miles of macadamised hard
roads; 2,892 miles defined; and perhaps as
many more miles of district or by-roads and 1,600
miles of telegraph were in operation, through
which were transmitted some 500,000 mess-
ages during the year 1878.
CREDIT SALES.
The total quantity of land taken up upon
the credit system during the last eight years is
3,568,195 acres, for which £5,039,656 was
agreed to be paid. Of this amount £4,253,800
still remains on credit. During the last year
—lB7B—for 609,363 acres taken up the
amount agreed to be paid was £939,957. Ex-
tensive areas of new lands are now under sur-
vey for the purposes of new settlements.
PASTORAL OCCUPATION.
Some conception of the growth of the
pastoral interest may be formed from the fact
that whilst in 1851 the total area of land leased
from the Crown for pastoral purposes was
15,000 square miles, at the present time there
are upwards of 200,000 square miles in occu-
pation. During the same period the number
of horses has increased from 6,500 to 121,550;
of horned cattle from 75,000 to 251,800; and
of sheep from 1,000,000 to over 6,377,000,
whilst the exports of wool have increased
from 4,000 to over 140,000 bales.
During the last ten years the average price
of first-class fat bullocks has averaged
£l4. 10s.; and of first-class fat wethers 15s.
per head.
The enclosure of the sheep runs, the forma-
tion of dams and reservoirs in which large
bodies of water can be stored, and the sinking
of wells are the most important improvements
required, and are those to which the greatest
attention is now being paid. By these means
an immense area of land has been opened up,
and stocked with both sheep and cattle.
Almost limitless tracks of country bordering
on the transcontinental telegraph line, as well
as land laid open by recent explorations, are
awaiting pastoral occupation.
WOOL.
The export of wool has increased during
the past five years upwards of 70 per cent.
The total value of South Australian wool
shipped in 1856 was £412,163; in 1876,
£1,547,268 ; and in 1878, £1,834,071 sterling.
The excellent quality of the staple, the
great suitability of the climate giving almost
complete immunity from scab, fluke, and other
diseases peculiar to sheep, taken together with
the security of tenure enjoyed by the pastoral
leases, conduce to the rapid development of
this profitable industry.
COPPER.
South Australia owes no little of its
prosperity to the employment of a large
number of its people in the working of her
copper mines. The principal mines are the
Burra, Wallaroo, and Moonta. From the

and that four and-a-half millions remain due

In addition to these lines, there are in

raihvay. The rolling stock of the Govern-
ment consists of 33 locomotives, 55 passenger
carriages, and 883 goods Avagons.

on Government railways amounted to
£2,652,088, and the Avorking expenses, in-
cluding re-construction and maintenance to
£2,280,106, leaving a balance to profit of
£371,982. The receipts for 1878 exceeded
the expenditure by £103,166.
The average charge for passengers per
mile is and the charge for conveying a

Bank of Australia, National Bank of Australasia,
English, Scottish, and Australian Chartered
Bank, Bank of Adelaide, Bank of Ncav South
Wales, and Commercial Bank of South Aus-
tralia, all of Avhich have establishments in the
principal sea-ports and inland toAvnships, in all

POSTAL COMMUNICATION.

Great attention has been devoted to the
subject of postal communication. Considering
the thinly-peopled and extensive area of the
outlaying settled districts, more than ordinary
facilities are afforded the public by frequent
and rapid despatch of inland mails. A uniform
rate of 2d. per half ounce is charged upon
letters carried to places Avithin the province,
and a like rate for letters posted to the sister
colonies of Australasia. No charge is made
the carriage of newspapers, either inland,
or to any part of the Avorld, so far as the South
Australian Post Office is concerned. Penny
postal cards have been introduced Avith very
satisfactory results.
South Australia to the growth of Avine was
soon discovered by the early settlers, some of
whom had brought from Europe a variety of
high-class vine cuttings.
That the Avines of South Australia are, as
a rule, of a high character, is proved by the
fact that they have ahvays been aAvarded
prizes at the several great International
Exhibitions.

The cost of clothing may be estimated at
about 10 per cent, higher than English prices.
As garments more suitable to the climate can
be purchased in the Colony, it is not generally
advisable for emigrants to stock themselves
unduly in this country.
FRUITS.
Considerable attention has also been paid
to the manufacture of preserved fruits, and
the drying of raisins and currants. This
branch is rapidly progressing, and Avhilst it

ADELAIDE, SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
LETTER FROM
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
A Buckinghamshire farmer
lately wrote the Rev. Mr.
Bickford, 'Wesleyan Minister
of South Australia, for in-
formation and advice respect-
ing the advisability of emi-
grating to the colony. Mr.
Bickford handed the letter to
an old resident there, who
replied as follows :
“ Mongalata, South
Australia,
March 16 th, 1880.
Dear Sir, —In response
to the Rev. Mr. Bickford’s
request, I purpose giving
you some practical counsel
derived from experience
gathered from 25 years
•residence in this country,
where, at the present, I
hold some 7,000 acres of
land, and 900 in crop last
season, the rest being in
pasture for sheep. I mention
this that you may know
that I am speaking of
matters of present experi-
ence, and for further en-
couragement observe that
I came to Australia 27
years ago, unknown to a
single individual; but, by
Divine blessing on my
industry, have arrived at
my present position. Having
in 1874-5 spent 18 months
in United States, Canada,
England and France, I

I feel sure that though you
will feel strange and uncom-
fortable at the absence of old
faces and associations, this
will pass away in a few
months, and backed by your
judgment, you will learn daily
to thank the providence which
has directed your steps to a
country where your family
may find scope for improve-
ment in every mental, social,
and material power they
possess.
As regards other occupa-
tions, tradesmen in limited,
supply find ready employment
especially steady moral men,
especially in the building
trades. You can hardly rea-
lise a naked country where
every new comer must have
a house built for him. Before
I close, I would point out that
it is the dryness of our climate-
that gives us pre-eminence as
a wheat-growing colony, and
the absence of flowing springs
and brooks is a great- draw-
back, but the breaking of the
soil is steadily improving our
supply of water, which now
has to be caught in tanks or
reservoirs in winter ; this is
no real hindrance to settle-
ment, but is a feature you
would not think to take into
your estimate, and I men-
tion it, that as far as pos-
sible, no difficulty should
come suddenly on you. These
reservoirs are excavated by
plough and scoops by horse power, and cost about
Bd. per cubic yard, and do not need cementing, the
soil being so retentive of moisture. I do not know
of any material fact more to put before you, but again
enforce the advice to bring cash, not luggage. Bank
interest here is 10 per cent. Capitalists get large
profits as well as their customers, and our things are
made to suit our climate, everything iron, as wood
perishes in the dry heat. Living is cheap, and stock
also—a good cow can be had for £5 to £6, and sheep
from ss. to 12s. Flour, 2ls. to 255. per bag of 200
lbs. Potatoes, Bs. per cwt. and so on, while clothes
are as cheap as in England, and implements also,
considering the make. Little labour is used here.
My farm here is worked by my son, and a boy for
cattle. You can hardly realise 200 acres cropped
with this labour, but it is a fact, and next year
50 acres more will be put in. This farm is fifty
miles from my larger estate, worked by a manager,
but where I seldom go. This is being developed
for my son, when he is old enough to settle—
when I shall retire in his favour. In reading the
accounts of agricultural distress in England I long
to tell them to cotnc ; if only with willing hands and
thrifty habits, they can always do better here than
there. But the labouring classes are selfish, and try
to prevent anyone 'coming, lest wages should be
interfered with. Wages for farm labourers are 18s.
to 20s. per week, and house wood, water and food in
abundance. On landing, no one should cast away his
bedding, as these are always useful. Here a man’s
dark blankets are his constant companion ; but boxes of
clothes to a single man is a nuisance.
I hope you may see fit to change your home. For
any further information you may require you have
only to address,
Yours,
J. P. STEPHENS, M.D. and J.P.

after harvest, when the same horses cart and mill, and
thus he has increased his stock and implements, and
also his tillage, till he is now putting in 200 acres; but
the house he put up as a makeshift he is in no hurry
to leave, as he finds so many uses for his money; and
while at home his position would have suffered from
such surrounding, his thrift and self-denial at once
increases his capital and credit; as the building of a
good house at such an early stage would be deemed
unwise and reflect on his judgment. Having a son
just home from college, I resolved to select a block
for him, and pursued exactly the same course, but
having more capital have built myself a good and
substantial stone house.
Many persons improve a section and sell it at 20s.
to 40s. per acre premium, when perhaps their improve-
ment did not cost them 15s. per acre; where a man
has no family, or only girls perhaps, it is the best plan
to buy an improved farm, but with a large family it is
the wisest to select and expend the money yourself,
you can secure room for your family in the future;
640 to 1,000 acres is the usual size of selections,
though you can get them any size. The agencies of
our church are so widely that you can always
settle in proximity to our services, though what is near
would receive a different answer by us than by you,
as a few of our farms renders a horse and trap a
necessity to enable you to reach the place of service—
often in a farmers’ barn, as in our case here, Mr.
Bickford preached in mine last Sabbath, where regular
services are held, by a local brother and myself every
Sunday; we are 18 miles from the circuit town.
You will probably realise from this experience a
better idea of our affairs—as it is the common mode
of procedure by which the country has extended to an
unprecedented degree. Of course there are cheaper
methods of stocking, by buying second-hand imple-
ments, &c.
