dressing his legs.] This comes of keeping late hours, and
drinking champagne and other patriotic liquors, [linking
them,] I’m ashamed of you ! You are unsuppnrlable, and
set a had example to my head, which has an inclination to
dance the cachuca.
Voices in the street sing a drunken chorus. lieu heu heu t

It’s astonishing the affection we gentlemen, who are not
blessed with what the newspapers call “ affluence,” have for
Cur roosting places ; they not only serve ue for repose, hut
decrease our consumption of food and fuel. Oh, that lovely
little creature 1 danced with at the masquerade ! What a
foot—what a waist ! That last gallop-oh ! j Imitates the
cornet a piston, and dances the gallop , holding the bolster
in his arms for a partner. At Ike end of the dance he
hicks against a folded paper which is on the floor-] Eh!
what’s this ? [ Picks it up.] A paper that has been pushed
under the door! [Puls the bolster under hU arm and reads,]
Ah! death and the old gentleman ! A notice from the
court that my furniture will be seized 10-day, for a debt
contracted with a rascally tailor. What a reproach on a
free country, that a gentleman can’t owe a few hundred
francs without being forced to pay at his creditor’s conve-
nience. Seize my furniture 1 Bring my beautiful rose-
wood chairs and tables —my pictures, and my family plate
and china to the hammer - shameful i Oh, the cabbaging
rascal ! If I had you here for live minutes. I’d beat you

wakes with a start.]
Cleo. Come in,
Ant. There goes the china ! [ Throws plate, and cup and
saucer against door .]
Cleo, [Rising.] ’Tis a smash in the next room. [Calling ]
I say, sir—Mademoiselle—Madame, or whatever you may
be.lwishyou wouldn’t make such a row there. You keep
people from sleeping.
Ant. Go along, my good woman—go along. Don’t in-
terfere in things that don’t concern you. [Throws another
plate.]
Cleot Hello ! hollo, there ! I wish you wouldn’t. Can’t
you throw your plates and dishes out of the window ? [She
brings forward ironing stove, lights fire with a iucifer, and
blows it with the bellows .]
Ant. Ah ! ’tis the little shirt maker I have so often heard
singing at her work. [tSinjrs in imitation .] Good morning,
neighbour. How do you do ? 1 hope you are pretty well ?
Cleo. Pretty well, thank you. Goodnight. [Blowing at
stove, on which she places the irons. J
Ant, I haven’t the pleasure of your acquaintance, have 1 !
[Kneeling on chair, and rocking it. 1
Cleo, No—you are quite a stranger.
Ant. Ah, I’m sorry for that. Never mind —if you should
be taken ill at any time, call for me, and I’ll come and com-
fort you.
Cleo. Much obliged— [Brings down ironing table ]—l
shan’t trouble you. [Blows fire.]
Ant. Not the slightest trouble. [Goes to door in parti-
tion. She’s lighting her fire ! [ Knocks at the door.] Neigh-
bour !
Cleo, Well, what’s the matter —what do you want ?
Ant. Can you oblige me with a light t
Cleo. No. You are very impertinent to disturb me so. I
won’t answer you any more. [Tries heat of iron.]
Ant. Oh, don’t be so unsociable, my little darling. There
is only the door between us—let me break through the fee-
ble barrier, and on my knees sue for pardon and" [He
shakes door,]
Cleo. Ah, you had better leave that alone. If you try to
open it, I'll alarm the house. [Aside.] Ive often thought
that door remarkably dangerous. [lrons a collar.]
Ant. [Lights a cigar,] Good night, my love. Pleasant
dreams.
Cleo. Thank you. [Aside.] Masquerades—hussars—
mouslachtos. [Aloud.] Good night.


Ant* Good night. But I’m not going to bed yet. When
one has danced for two, and supped for four, a cigar id an
indispensable night cap. [Blows smoke through keyhole*]
Smoke not disagreeable,! hope ?
CleOr Not at all—l like it ( I smoke my —ahem I good
night. [Aside,] His allusion to supper puts me in mind
that lam hungry. [Goes to buffet, cuts o slice of bread ,
imd c overs it with raspberry jam. J
Ant. [Aside. I’ll have another try to bring her out ! [He
sits on bed. and throws a plate at door in partition .] Slips !
1 beg pardon, neighbour—quite an accident. You break
something, and we shall be quits.
Cleo • Pshaw IPm not so foolish. [ln putting the loaf
into the buffet she knocks down a plate. ]
Ant‘ Ah 1 thank you, my love—-Pm eternally obliged.
Cleo. He thinks 1 broke it on purpose. Oh, the fool !
[Laughs loudly, and thumps the table with her iron.]
Ant [Knocks against door- ] “ Come, I say—Mademoi-
selle, or Madame, or whatever you may bo, I wish you
wouldn't make such a row—you keep people from sleep-
ing.”
Cleo . There’s impudence I yet 1 can't help laughing at
him. [Approaches the door.] I wonder if he is good look-
ing.
Ant. My merry neighbour ought to be pretty. [ They
both look through the keyhole at the same time.] No effects.
It is plugged on the other side.
Cleo . Not a glimpse! it is stopped up with putty. [Goes
to table,puts down the slice of bread and Jam, and conti-
nues her ironing ]
Ant, I’m rather near-sighted. [ Takes a telescope from un-
der the bed, kneeh f ana places it at the keyhole.] 1M bring
her down with a long shot 1 No go- I won’t give her up.
I’ll get herlnto conversation. Madame— ■
Cleo. Mademoiselle.
Ant. Ah, Pm delighted to hear that. Mademoiselle, can
you inform me what o’clock it is by your watch 1 Mine
has gone down.
Cleo. [Seats herself on the corner of table, and eats
the bread and Jam.] Sorry I can’t oblige you, for mine’s
gone up— ahem—l mean, down, too.
Ant.. Another failure I Here goes again- Madame—
Clo. Mademoiselle. [Eating*]
Ant. I beg pardon. Mademoiselle—l think you said you
were
Cleo . Well, upon my word, you are* a very inquisitive
person* Hadn't you better ask me if I m handsome, or


ugly, short or tall, thin or stout, light or dark, young or
old, rich or poor, and anything else that may strike you.
Ant Certainty, such is my intention ; but by way of
preface, allow me to give you a slight sketch of myself, I
am light, handsome and thin, like a fashionable novel in a
single volume—my name is known in history, my profes-
sion is liberal, and I am got up by a good tailor, regard*
lees of expense.
Cleo* I’ll be equally candid. I am a young lady of indr»
pendant fortune, and my father was an officer in the king’s
household. A footman!
Ant. I have just left the masquerade at (he Opera.
Cleo. So have I.
Ant . Where I amused myself in glorious style.
Cleo* So did I!
Ant. 1 danced the cachucha, and the can-qan.
Cleo . So did I—ahem ! —no, no -Imean, 1 didn’t.
Ant, You did—you did 1 Ah, if you should be my little
lighterman.
Cleo . [Aside.] Heavens, my hussar 1 [Aloud.] What
lighterman ?
Ant, A merry fascinating little devil that I followed all
night—an angel in velvet trousers, who set my heart on
lire ! Ah, I think I see her now, with her hands in her
pockets, and her head thrown saucily aside, as she started
in the gallop with the left foot in advance. [A« he speaks,
Cleopatra tales the positions ] She interested me to such a
point, madame—l beg pardon, mademoiselle—that I offered
her my hand and fortune in the vast arena of the Opera
House, before several hundreds of Pierrots, Turks, and
Tartars, but, whiz! she slipped through my fingers like an
eel, and disappeared in a cloud.
Cleo. [Forgetting herself ] No, no—a hackney coach*
Ant. What ! it teas you.
f'leo. [ Laughs loudly.] Good night, neighbour.
Ant. Oh, my dear angel—my lovely neighbour—my
adored little lighterman ! Oh, you little crocodile ! [Bawl-
ing through keyhole.] Seraphine, I demand you in marriage.
Cleo. Already ! I ask three hours to consult my family,
and make enquiry into your character. But I have already
a good deal of information regarding you.
Ant, What information, Pamela, my angel ? Explain,
dear Caroline—
Cleo [Goes to door in partition.] Faithless hussar ! the
sky blue domino——
Ant. Ah, did you see me? Pardon, dear Clotilde—
C/eo. Seals herself ivilh buck to door In partition , eating


bread and jam. Aside] Seraphine, Pamela, Caroline, Clo-
tilda ! What will he call me nexUl wonder 1 [Aloud.] Well,
monster 1
Ant. When you ran away fromme I was wandering about
in despair, when the confounded sky blue domino threw
herself into my arms. ‘‘ Allons. hussar!” said she “ gal-
lop !’’ Away she dragged me, aud on we went, like devils
in a whirlwind !
Cleo. [Sings the air of the gallop,] Well, Timoleon——
Ant. Antony !
Cleo. La, how very odd! I’m Cleopatra.
Ant. Indeed? Extraordinary genealogical coincidence!
We are bound to imitate our great prototypes. They had
no wall between them. [Shaking door.] Let us be histori-
cally correct.
Cleo. No, no, no 1 Historians differ. If you presume to
touch the door again, I’ve done with you for ever, [ifats ]
Go on about the domino
Ant- Cruel Aspasia ! Well, during the dance, I perceived
my partner had a small elastic waist, and a remarkably
p etty foot
Cleo. [Looking at her feet.,] After all you said of mine.
Faithless hussar !
Ant. Forgive me, fair Queen of Egypt—my perfidy has
been punished. When the gallop was over, 1 asked my
domino o take a glass of punch.
Cleo. A la Romaine?
Ant. No—rum.
Cleo. [Pours water from bottle into lea cup and drinks.]
It’s remarkably nice !
Ant. It’s astonishing how our tastes assimilate. Dear
Ch'oe— [Shaking door.]
Cleo. Hussar, remember—behave yourself. Go on with
your romance.
Ant. She accepted several glasses of the treacherous
fluid. Of course 1 kept her in countenance. By degrees we
grew animated, sentimental, and affectionate. Still she
persisted in remaining incognito. Finding all my entreaties
useless, I had recourse to stratagem. I watched her in a
looking glass, and as she turned and lifted her mask to im-
bibe the punch, had a view of her face. Imagine my
horror, dear Chloe, she was as old as the hills—a grand-
mother of sixty, at the very least.
Cleo, [Laughing.] Ha, ha, ha! poor hussar ! What a
fool you must have looked—ha, ha, ha !
Ant. My passion was cooled in an instant. With one
bound I cleared the table and gained the street, when I
look to my heels, and never stopped till I got home.


Cleo. What a miracu ous escape !
Ant. It was, indeed—and I’ve had another just now. The
old Jezabel followed me in a hackney coach, and if I bad
not persuaded the driver he had mistaken the house, she
would have come up stairs, and then I don’t know what
would have become of me.
Cleo . You deserve to be forced to marry her, as a pu-
nishment for your perfidy to me. Didn’t you swear that I
was the only being you could ever love ? Faithless, hus-
sar I
Ant. I did—l did, fair sylphide. But you runaway and
left me in the middle of the dance !
Cleo. You were getting too affectionate, hussar. You
had no business to kiss people on so short an acquaint-
ance.
Ant. 1 wished to keep up my character, and saluting is
a military manoeuvre. You owe me a gallop, Cetestine, and
I must beg you to name an early day to pay it.
Cleo. You shall have it now. [Removes table.]
Ant. Ah —[Running to door, and trying to open it.]—my
angel!
Cleo. No, no - imagine the wall away.
Ant. Impossible 1 I’m a materialist, and hate the ideal.
[Shaking door .j
Cleo. Hussar, I ins'et! Another shake, and I call for as-
sistance. Now—are you ready ?
Ant. Tormentor I Are you still in costume ?
Cleo , Yes, wig, and every thing.
Ant, I’m the same.
Cleo . Now, then, en place— face the wall, and off we go !
[ They place themselves at the extremity of the Stage, facing
each other , and go through a gallopade- (which is played
in the orchestra)— Antony pretending that he holds a lady ,
and C eopatra that she is held by a gentleman.]
Ant. [/Speaking through the music.] Oh, you dear little
devil !
Cleo. Hussar, behave yourself—don’t squeeze me so !
Ant. [Striking the partition.] Confound the wall!
Cleo. Be quiet, hussar ! I’ll call murder Let me go-
let me go—-
Ant. Only one kiss —only one—
Cleo. Very well—lake it!
Ant. [Smacking his lips . in imitation of a hiss ] Ob !
bless you ! [Atlhe end of the dance Cleopatra falls into a
chair, and Antony throws himself on the bed, and hicks and
tumbles .]
Cleo. Oh, I’m quite exhausted Waiter! A glass of
champagne !


Ant , A bottle ! a bottle, and a bowl of punch 1 [Jump-
ing from the bed, and going to door in partition, ] Lighter-
man !
Cleo. Hussar !
Ant. Since you won't allow this door to be opened, I’ll
go oat and try the other in the passage— [Going,]
Cleo. Do—at your peril! [£o/ls c. d»J
Ant. [Aloud,] On second thoughts, I won’t. [Aside,]
I have a better plan. The last gentleman who lodged here
left behind him a bunch of skeleton keys. I'll try the
soothing system. [ Searching in table drawer.]
Cleo. He’s so quiet, Tin afraid he’s meditating mischief!
Ant • [Goes on tiptoe to door in partition, and puts in
key ] Mow for an agreeable surf-rise I
Cleo [Alarmed.] Hal he is picking the lock! Hussar,
I command you to desist ! I’ll scream I Hussar —hussar !
don’t be foolish. He perseveres ! What will become of
me? Ah [Struck with a sudden thought.]— the blue
domino! I’ll frighten him awaj. [Opens bafjet, takes out
a blue domino, and exit by door at back. ]
Ant [Trying to unlock door.] Forgive me, dearest an-
gl -1 am desperate. Confound the key —it won’t turn!
Don’t be cruel, Emmeline. I shall never make it answer ?
Speak to me, light of my soul ! I should never do for a

tion.] Antony, dearest—support me, or I shall fall- [*S7<e

Ant. Devil take the old tabby! [diving a chair.] Here—
here, sit down, you old hyena— sit down— [Rushing her
into chair.]
Cleo. Where am I ? [ Looking round wildly.]
Ant. Oh, you know well enough. Up six tlights of stairs
in the Rue Chamont.
Cleo. Ha! memory returns to me. A masquerade—a
gallop—an hussar —punch ala Romaine—
Ant. Which you took a pretty good whack of, old mer-
maid !


Cleo It is not a dream—the dear youth is here! Come
to my fluttering heart ! [Trying to embrace him J
Ant . No, no—sit down, and don’t agitate yourself. T//e
pushes her into chair.] What the devil shall I do with her ?
Cleo. Oh. Tony, dear —how could you desert me, so
cruelly ? [£t6s.]
Ant Tony dear ! Familiar old porcupine ! Come, come
—[Shaking her ]— no nonsense. The champagne has got
into your head. You had better go home, and go to bed.
Cleo . I am at home. Cruel hussar ! didn’t you swear to
me elerna! constancy 1 Your perfidy has nearly broken my
heart. You are my first and only love—the realization of
my girlish dreams. You swore you loved me, and —and 1
look a hackney coach—and —and , Sobbing.]
Ant. What, madam 'I In the name of all that's damna-
b e—what ?
Cleo, I—l have come home! [Throws herself into his
arms.]
Ant Horible old vampire ! She'll send for her boxes,
and mark her dresses with my name.
Cleo . [ Passionately .] I care not for wealth—you areniy
only treasure, i could starve with you in a lone hut on a
desolate heath ! (_Looking round, and speaking in her na-
tural voice,] Dear me, what a hole ! You are not overbur-
dened with furniture, hussar. [Resuming her affectation ]
And though a!i the world forsake us, we would be rich in
love.
Ant. Yes, yes. [Aside,] How can I escape from her ?

Ant . Nothing that lean immediately recollect.
CleOi. Have you forgot the pretty feet, and the taper waist
you admiied so much ? [Shows her feet, and crosses to l
h. holding the domino round her to show her figure.]
Ant. No, no. It’s astonishing! Anybody might swear
she was young. Cinderella might envy her feet, and Venus
her figure. The age of women, like that of poultry, is only
to be told by their beaks. If 1 could open this confounded
door I should be safe [ Working at door with his hand
behind him.]
Cleo. Hussar
Ant [Pulling away his hand'] Domino !
Cl*o, Vou don t seem glad to see me. Shall I take off my

key-] —one dose is enough. It turns! it turns I
Cieo, Say but one kind word, dear Tony—say
Ant. [Opening door, and dasning through into the next
room,] Good night!
Cleo. [ Bolts the door in partition, places her back against

lend me one of your razors,
Cleo. Take the bread and butter knife—you’ll find it in
the closet. [Antony thumps the buffet with his fist- ] Hoilo
—hollo? don’t break my valuable glass and china !
Ant. Rosalie, my angel—l’m distracted—mad !
Cleo. Put on a strait waistcoat, and have your head sha-
ved, Ha, ha, ha !
Ant. Cruel Chios ! Do not trifle with my sufferings !
Open the door or I’ll jump out of window !
Cleo. You can’t. It’s a skylight I ■ Ha, ha, ha ! Keep
quiet till eight o'clock and 1 will release you.
Ant, No, no. I must and will [A knock is heard at

through keyhole ] —oh, come to my funeral ! [Knocking at

in, and give him a taste of the bread and butter knife,
Cleo, No, no. Pray be quiet.

duck ? Chloe—Chloe, my love —Chloe !
Ant. [ln a whisper to Cleopatra ] He calls you his
darling duck —I can’t stand that ! [Aloud, in a very gruff
voice, as if waking from sleep.] Hollo, hollo, hollo—who’s
there ?
Cleo. [Sinking into a chair.] Ah, I am settled !
Voice. [ln atone of surprise.] Eh ? dear me ! I wanted
a young lady called Cleopatra.

[Throws himself into the broken chair.] Poor devil—ha.
ha, ha I [ Chair breaks—befalls] Hollo, hollo ! Caroline,
my love, your chairs are very ricketty.
Cleo . Do you know what you ve done, sir 1 [ Thumping
