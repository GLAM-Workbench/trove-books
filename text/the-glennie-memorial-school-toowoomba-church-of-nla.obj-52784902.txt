THE GLENNIE MEMORIAL SCHOOL
TOOWOOMBA
Thu School is under the direction of His Grace the Archbishop of Brisbane and the
Council of the Diocese of Brisbane.
The School Buildings are situated in twelve acres of ground, over 2000 feet above sea
level; they are constructed in accordance with the most approved modern designs, and health
and comfort are specially considered.
The Misses Lawrance had for some years private boarding schools in England and the
Continent, and having also had considerable experience in scholastic work in Australia, the}'
are thoroughly accustomed to the care and training of girls, morally, intellectually, and
physically.
It is the great wish of the Principals to cultivate in the minds of their pupils an earnest
purpose in life, and to ensure this, every attention is paid to the individual character and
tastes of each pupil.
The Religious Instruction is in the hands of the Principals and the Rev. Teesdale Cockell,
Rector of St. James’, Toowoomba.
Special_attention is paid to delicate and backward girls, and the physical development of
all the pupils is under the direct control of the Principals.
Miss Margaret Lawrance holds special classes for Physical Culture as taught in Loudon,
and both Principals supervise the daily Drill and Calisthenics, and take a personal interest
in all out-door games.

The Ordinary Course
of Instruction
includes preparation for University Examinations, but the
Principals are of opinion that an excellent and generally
efficient education can be obtained without the strain of
examinations, which is often too much for growing girls.
Miss Grace Lnwmnce personally supervises all the musical
instruction, and pupils can specialise under her in Singing, Piano-
forte, and Harmony.
Miss Lawrance is ably assisted by highly qualified resident
mistresses, Music being one of the specialities of the School.
Special attention is given to English Composition, Literature,
and Languages. French and German Conversation Classes taught
only by mistresses with .Continental experience, is general throughout
the School.


Advanced Classes
for French and German Conversation and Literature may lie
attended by girls not hiking the ordinary course.
The Principals supervise the teaching of all subjects throughout
the School, taking classes in each subject at intervals.
According to the linglish High School system, the mornings
are devoted to the ordinary school subjects, and the afternoon work
consists of lighter lessons and preparation, thus .reducing the
home-work. .
Pupils not wishing to take the full school course may
devote extra time to special subjects, such as Music, Painting,
Languages, &c.
Pupils may he prepared for the Kxamiiiatious of the Associated
Board R.A.M. and R.C.M. in Music, Singing, Theory, and Harmony.
Tennis mid Cricket teams are organised in the Summer, and
Basket-ball is the Winter game. This game, following the rules of
Hockey, and being less rough, is belter suited to girls, while it affords
excellent physical exercise.
