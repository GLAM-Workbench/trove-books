Specimen of Turnery
A Circular Masonic Table, manufactured out of several thousand
pieces of European and Colonial marble and malachite. The
top of the table, which is twenty-one inches in diameter, shows
in the centre, the emblem of the Grand Master of the Masonic
Lodge, while the margin of the table displays the emblems of
the different officers. The emblem of the Grand Master is
enclosed with the six points of Masonry, and encircled with a
tesselated pavement, while the top of the table, between the
centre and the margin, represents a blazoned star. The base
consists of a triangle, cambered; displaying on the horns, as
principal designs, the Doric, lonic, and Corinthian columns;
while in one of the segments between the horns, there is shown
a cypress tree in malachite ; the second shows the plumb-rule,
level, and setting maul; and the third contains a coffin, the
emblem of mortality. On one face of the pedestal, which it
hexagonal, is shown the Bible on a cushion, over which stands
the emblem of Faith, holding a cross in her left hand, and with
her right hand placed on her bosom ; on another face, is the
emblem of the brazen serpent lifted on the cross, with the letter
G over it; on the third face, are six points of Masonry—over
this stands the emblem of Hope ; while the fourth face shows
the masonic key-stone; the fifth face displays the five points of
Masonry, surmounted by the emblem of Charity—a female figure,
with one child in her arms and another looking up beseechingly
into her face ; and the sixth face contains the alphabet of Ma-
sonry,, and above it the dove alighting on the earth after the flood.
