Our Account Books are noted for Price and Quality


A Few Preliminary Words
This is our latest catalogue—l92B.
It will tell you a great deal you wish to know about us.
It is our silent salesman.
It contains faithful illustrations of some of our goods.
One thing in particular that we claim is that
We Sell none but the Very
Highest Quality of Goods
We have built up a reputation over 98 years for quality, and
will do our best to maintain it.
Our buying power permits us to import the bulk of our goods
direct from the firms that make them. This helps us to
sell you only first grade goods at the lowest prices they can
be sold at.
Our London Office is 10 Godliman Street.
In our Manufacturing Department we employ the most skilful
workmen and modern machinery to help them, and they
put their best work into every order.
We ask you to make this catalogue a handbook of reference
and to consult its pages when you have need for Legal
Stationery, Account Books, Office Sundries, etc.

Agents for Britannic Self-Filling Fountain Pens


Our Business Terms
ACCOUNTS are rendered monthly, unless special arrangements are
made to the contrary.
With NEW CUSTOMERS, a satisfactory Sydney reference will
prevent unnecessary delay in executing orders, as it is impossible for us
to know the position of all who favour us with their patronage.
Correspondents from the COUNTRY who have no account in our
books will please remit an amount sufficient to cover orders, including
railway carriage, sea freight, or postage, all cheques, etc., to be crossed
payable to the Firm.
In any case where the carriage, freight, or postage cannot be closely
estimated, an amount amply sufficient should be added to the remittance,
and any excess will be returned at once.
To prevent errors in addressing, our country friends will kindly write
their names and addresses plainly, and notify whether Mr., Mrs., or Miss,
and also advise us as to the method of transit, whether by passenger
or goods train, post, steamer, or to any Sydney house for enclosure.
All goods will be thoroughly well packed, but we do not hold ourselves
responsible for breakages after they have left our premises.
All orders are most carefully checked before despatch, and, where
goods have apparently been omitted, a careful search in the straw or
packing may be respectfully recommended, as in almost every case the
goods are discovered to have been received, but overlooked.
SHIPPING ORDERS.—Special attention is given to the execution and
shipment of all orders to customers in New South Wales, to other States,
and the Islands, Insurance is effected on all goods of the value of £5 and
over, outside the State, and the amount is charged in the account. Inter-
state certificates are supplied and entries passed free of charge.
SAMPLES will be forwarded upon application in all cases except
where the goods are of some intrinsic value.
CORRESPONDENCE.—AII business communications to be addressed
to W. C. PENFOLD & CO. LTD., 88 Pitt Street, Sydney.
FLUCTUATION OF PRICES.—Our prices quoted in this catalogue
have occasionally to be altered owing to fluctuations, alterations in tariff, etc.

FAULTLESS FLEXI-POST LOOSE
LEAF LEDGER
LINK POST
EXPANSION WITH
SECTIONS
It permits the covers to close on any number of sheets from one up;
but because of the addition of extra sections the book never becomes full.
No section ever protrudes. At any capacity—say, with five hundred or
seven-fifty in the book —it is as easy to extract or insert a sheet as with
only one, as there are always at least two inches of “play” provided by the
flexible links. The direct screw compression operated by the key is so
effective that the sheets are held in a vyce-like grip from which they cannot
be removed except by tearing out or by opening the book with its key. All
side or lateral play is obviated by two rigid centre posts which are built up
sectionally with the capacity of the ledger.
The solid key shaft is deeply cut with a three-start thread, which permits
of rapid expansion or opening of the covers. With the absence of any
unnecessary metal casing there is a minimum of weight.
Quality is Economy

UTILIFILE — The New Commercial File
See It - - Try It - - COMPARE It
With Any Commercial Grade File At Any Price
A good file—one that fits snugly into the business atmosphere of your office; drawers that
will work smoothly and quietly after years of hasty “ins” and "outs”; space to always hold in
orderly readiness that correspondence of the moment and of the yesterdays of your daily
transactions —that IS a good file, if the price is right.
Just walk up to the New Berloy “Utilifile.” Solid brass handles invite you to pull out a
drawer. Smooth, noiseless, easy_ action. Space, lots of it. Stability that says, Your
money invested in me will come back with interest in long years of service."
The assembly of these ideas, fabricated in steel, embellished with solid brass hardware and
finished in a beautiful neutral green, is pleasing to the eye, animated at your touch on
the drawer handle and a sound investment for the owner.

THE BERLOY UTILIFILE COMMERCIAL TILE
The cheaper than wood file at a price
within the reach of everyone.
500 SERIES
Berloy Utilifiles should not be confused with the
large number of so-called “non-suspension” ver-
ticals, very obviously produced to sell at a low
price without regard to quality.
The Utilifile is built for all-round commercial
use. Nothing has been overlooked either in design
or construction that would add to its practical
utility.
The case construction and outside appearance is
identically the same as the “800” series verticals,
the only difference being in the suspension
mechanism. Instead of the Ball Bearing Roller
suspension used on all “800” series file drawers,
the Utilifile is fitted with a very substantial Roller
Channel, which assures easy operation of the
drawers, although it does not carry them com-
pletely out of the case.
It is made in Letter and Cap size only, with and
without automatic lock in standard olive green
or grained finishes.
595, L, Foolscap, 4 Drawer, with lock ,£,16/-/
BERLOY FOUR-ROLLER TRANSFER UNITS
The solid sides and high back keep contents safe
from fire, dust and mice. The heavy channel
steel frame permits stacking loaded units to the
ceiling, if floor space is limited, without causing
the lower, drawers to bind. Records are safe
and instantly accessible in Berloy transfers.
The drawer head is reinforced with a plate of
steel on the inside where the handle is attached,
to give extra strength at this point of strain.
Solid legs, part of the channel frame, slip into
the channels of the case below, forming a positive
connection.
A hook fastener at the rear locks the units ver-
tically, preventing the top case from tipping for-
ward when the loaded drawer is extended.

“800” Series Berloy Four Draw Verticals
Structural Details
The continued ease o; operation of the “800” series file drawers is achieved by the use of
eight silent, smooth running ball-bearing rollers which eliminate friction. The bearing
surface of these rollers is wide and years of constant use will not cause them to Wear
grooves in the heavy channel slide in which they operate.
The simplicity of the entire suspension is insurance against trouble. The slide is S-shaped.
Two rollers on the drawer and two on the side of the case run in the top and bottom
sections of this slide. Nothing to come apart or get out of order; no fragile catches, springs
or mechanism of any kind.
The hinged release at each end of the slide permits easy removal of drawers. Large rubber
bumpers eliminate objectionable metallic noises.
Built to Withstand Abuse: Exceptional strength and rigidity is built into the case or shell
oi' all Berloy Verticals. Steel sheets of the proper gauges, flanged and return-flanged, elec-
trically welded together and reinforced with angles and bars result in a construction that
will not only hold up under hard usage but will also withstand an unusual amount of punish-
ment in shipping which is the most severe test of the strength of a filing cabinet.
Capacity: Each drawer has a filing capacity of 23 inches, which has been found to be
the proper amount for quick filing. Any less would be waste. Any more would place the
back of the drawer beyond the average reach.
Finish: The fine finish of Berloy ”800” Series Verticals is produced by careful treatment
of the high grade furniture steel from which the files are made. The enamel is baked
on at a temperature of 200 degrees. The standard finish is a rich neutral shade of olive
green. ;
Hardware: All file drawers are fitted with formed solid polished brass hardware. No plated
hardware is used on any Berloy Files.
The Automatic Locking Device is sturdy, positive in operation, and trouble-proof. A
turn ot the locking lever drops the bar at the back of the case. Rigid hooks which are
firmly welded to the locking bar engage in clips at the back of the drawers. There are
no fragile parts, nor complicated mechanism. The spring which lifts the locking bar by
throwing the lever when the lock is released, is of the flat type, which lasts indefinitely,
and is accessible and easily replaced should it ever wear out.
le t-i, aUt f C>matiC * oc k ma V be applied to any case containing drawers, but must be applied
at the factory. The Yale lock is of the paracentric or corrugated key type. Individual
Hat key locks may be applied to any drawer except legal blanks.
Automatic Locking Compressors: All vertical filing drawers are provided with compressors,
which lock at any position in the drawer, yet a touch releases them. There is no slipping
with resultant disarrangement of contents. The compressor operates, independently of guide
rod, in a groove in the bottom of the drawer. The construction of this groove is such
that raw edges of steel are eliminated and binding or jamming of the compressor is impossible.

CARD INDEX CASES
Made in both 1 and 2 Drawer units for 5 x 3, 6 x 4, and Bxs Cards. Label Holders and
Pulls are of polished brass. Rubber feet can be supplied at a small extra cost to prevent
marring desk tops, etc. Drawers have bale suspension to prevent accidental withdrawal
from case. Stack can be built with the help of corner pieces and hook fasteners at the
rear. Flat keys can be fitted controlling both drawers in the 2 drawer unit. All joints
are spot welded, assuring maximum strength of construction.

MACHINE POSTING EQUIPMENT
Having decided to instal a Ledger Posting Machine, your first considera-
tion must he that of ledger posting equipment. Failure to install correct
means of handling your ledger sheets, statements, etc., will result in your
reducing the efficiency of the machine. We have been making installations
of this equipment since the introduction of Machine Book-keeping to Sydney.
Above are shown illustrations of a Steel Machine Posting Tray and Cover.
To remove the cover unlock and lift cover back as if hinged at rear, and
it automatically becomes detached. The bottom of the tray is covered with
rubber to prevent the sheets creeping and maintain them in an upright
position. The capacity and posting room is controlled by an adjustable
compressor operated by an instantaneous thumb screw. Room is provided
for offsetting and fillets are fitted where required.
An angle piece is supplied to give posting angle when working and a per-
pendicular face for the compressor block when closed.
Metal Traymobiles, fitted with ball bearing wheels, facilitate the handling
of the trays, and are the correct height for posting.
We also stock the above equipment
in hand dove-tailed seasoned oak.

Imperial ”
The New British-built Typewriter
It is a praiseworthy ideal to buy only British goods. But it is just practical common
sense to buy them if they are better and cheaper than those of foreign competitors.
1 f you want to be certain that the money you spend on a typewriter not only gives
you the greatest value—but that the British industry and the prosperity of your own
country are being helped—buy the “Imperial.”
} (
SEVEN ADVANTAGES OF THE IMPERIAL:—
Roller.
1. Interchangeable Type and Keyboard, giving access to
every mechanical part and the use of different styles of
i - i f ~ type.
2. Interchangeable Carriage, making it possible to use any
length of carriage on the one machine.
Carriage.
3. Interchangeable Roller, giving the use of soft, medium
or hard rollers, according to the class of work required.
4. Cheque-writing Attachment. Special Pin-point Type,
which perforates cheques, making them fraud-proof.
5. 90 Keyboard Characters as compared with 84 supplied
on most foreign machines.
6. Clear-cut Type. Every type is perfect and the general
quality of work superior to any writing machine built.
