S.—LANGUAGE AND SOCIOLOGY OF THE KUMBAINGGERI TRIBE,
NEW SOUTH WALES.
By K. H. MATHEWS, L.S., Associe etranger Soc. d’Anthrop. de Paris.
During the past few years I have contributed to the Royal Society
of New South Wales some original articles on the languages of Aus-
tralian tribes.*
In the following pages I shall endeavour to briefly describe the
elements of the grammar of the Kumbainggeri language, spoken by
the aborigines inhabiting the north-east coast of New South Wales,
from Nambucca to Grafton, and reaching inland to the Main Dividing
Range. These tribes were originally numerous and powerful, but have
so very much decreased during recent years that they are now only
found in small groups at a few camping places reserved for their use
by the Government of New South Wales.
In this language, in every part of speech subject to inflection, there
are two forms of the first person in the dual and plural, in one of
which the person or persons spoken to are included with the speaker;
and in the other, the party addressed is exclusive of the speaker.
ORTHOGRAPHY.
The system of orthoepy adopted is that recommended by the
Royal Geographical Society of England, but a few additional forms of
spelling have been incorporated to meet the requirements of the
Australian pronunciation, as follow:
As far as possible, vowels are unmarked, but in order to prevent
ambiguity of pronunciation, in some instances the long sound of
a , e, o, and u, are indicated thus: a, e, 6, u. In a few cases the
short sound of u is marked thus u.
Gis always hard. R has a rough trilled sound, as in the English
word “ hurrah!” W always commences a word or syllable. Tat the
beginning of a word or syllable has its ordinary consonant value.
The sound of the Spanish n often occurs. At the beginning of a
word or syllable I have represented this sound by ny, but when ter-
minating a word, the Spanish n is used.
Dh is pronounced nearly as th in the English word “that,” with
a slight sound of d preceding it. Nh has also nearly the sound of th
in “ that,” but with a slight initial sound of the n.

Ibid., vol. xxxvi., pp. 71-106. “Languages of Some Native Tribes of Queensland,
Ac.” Ibid., vol. xxxvi., pp. 135-190.


T is interchangeable with d ; -p with b ; and g with k.
Ty and dy at the commencement of a word or syllable have
nearly the sound of the English j, or the Spanish ch. At the end of
a word or syllable, ty or dy is sounded as one letter, closely approach-
ing tch in the English word “ watch,” but omitting the final hissing
sound.
Ng at the commencement of a word or syllable has a peculiar
nasal sound; at the end of a syllable it has the sound of ng in the
English word “ sing.”
Nouns.
Nouns have number, gender, and case.
Number. —There is no special declension for number, but the
noun is followed by words meaning two or several: —Nungo, a kan-
garoo; nungo bulari, a couple of kangaroos; nungo umaka, several
kangaroos.
Gender. —ln the human family, sex is distinguished by the em-
ployment of different words: —Nigar, a man. Nyumme, a woman.
Kibar, a boy. Ngundalgan, a girl. Yerrai, or gugangi, a baby of
either sex.
The gender of animals is denoted by using words meaning “male”
and “ female,” placed after the creature’s name, as Nungo kanaigan,
a male kangaroo. Nungo kandura, a female kangaroo.
Cane. —The principal cases are the nominative, causative, instru-
mental, genitive, accusative, dative, and ablative.
Nominative. This case merely names the thing spoken of, and
requires no change in the noun, as, wandyi, a dog; guragai, an
opossum.
Causative. When a transitive verb is used, the noun takes a
suffix, as Nyummeu bakumbal marang, a woman a perch caught.
Wandyidyu guragai yindang, a dog an opossum bit. Nigardu nungo
buang, a man a kangaroo struck.
Instrumental. Nigardu nganya bindaimang tuandu, a man at
me threw a boomerang.
Possessive. Nigargundi tua, a man’s boomerang. Nvummegundi
wakkar, a woman’s tomahawk.
Accusative. This case is the same as the nominative.
The dative and ablative cases are declined by postfixes in a
similar manner.
Adjectives.
Adjectives follow the nouns they qualify, and take similar
inflexions for number and case.
Nigar burwai, a man large. Nigardu burwaidu nungo buang, a
large man struck a kangaroo; and so on for the other cases.
It will be observed that the suffixes of both nouns and adjectives
are subject to modifications, depending upon the terminal letter of the
word declined.
Comparison. Nyam yunggo —nyam dharwi, this is bad —this is
good. Nyam dharruiunba, this is very good.


Pronouns.
Pronouns have number, person, and case, with two forms for the
first person of the dual and plural. The nominative personal
pronouns are as follows :
l Ist person — I
Singular j , nd _ Thou
V 3rd „ He
( Ngaidyu, with trans. verb
( Ngaia, with intrans. verb
Nginda
Guladhu
( , , (We, inclusive Ngulligai
l s person We, exclusive Ngulligadhu
DatLl j 2nd „ You Bulagai
(. 3rd „ They Bularidyu
( i»t nprson— $ We, inclusive Ngeagai
p) , \ P ( We, exclusive Ngeagaigiri
ura 1 2nd „ You Ngudyambindyu
V 3rd „ They Gularigiri
The possessive and objective personal pronouns are —
( Mine Nganvundi
Singular < Thine Nginyundi
His Grulagundi
Me N ganya
Thee Ngena
Him fxulannha
There are forms for all the persons of the dual and plural, but
they are omitted for the present.
There are forms of the pronouns meaning away from me,” “ to-
wards me,” &c., which must be passed over for want of space.
Interrogatives.—Warru, who? Minya, what?
Demonstratives. —Nyam, this. Mumum, that.
The language contains many forms of the interrogatives and
demonstratives, most of which are inflected for number and person.
Many of the demonstratives are likewise used as pronouns of the
third person, a fact which accounts for th» great differences in the
third personal pronouns in each number.
When used with an intransitive verb, the nominative pronouns
given in the table are employed, as, Ngaia dyun-gi, I am speaking.
But when connected with a transitive verb, a causative form of the
pronoun is employed, as Ngaidyu bindaimaigu, I shall throw.
Verbs.
Verbs have the singular, dual, and plural numbers, with the
usual tenses and moods. There is a form of the verb for each tense,
which remains constant through all the persons and numbers of that
tense. Any required number and person can be expressed by using the
suitable pronoun from the foregoing i:w-.


The following is a partial conjugation of a verb in the singum.
number, indicative mood: —
Indicative Mood —Present Tense.
C Ist person —I hear Ngaia ngaranggi
Singular \ 2nd „ Thou hearest Nginda ngaranggi
(.3rd ~ He hears Guladhu ngaranggi
and so on through all the persons of the dual and plural.
Past Tense.
Singular Ist person —I heard
Ngaia ngarawang
Future Tense.
Singular Ist person —I shall hear Ngaia ngaranggu
The imperative, conditional, reflexive, and reciprocal forms of the
verb are omitted for want of space.
Prepositions.
Between, pimita. On the other side, kawatadyula. On this side,
ilatngidda. Around, kokari. In rear, wallungga. In front, munggara.
Down, warri. Up, kaba.
Adverbs.
The following are a few of the more commonly used adverbs:—
Yes, nge. No, byekkai. To-day, gili. To-morrow, guraguradyu.
Yesterday, nyuggundvirra. Bye and bye, gung-a. Long ago, tyal-
lumbo. Soon, yaregili. Certainly, yare. Here, nyamyala. There,
njungara. None, biwai. Always, illagaingai. When, mulla. How,
dvugirgai.
The aboriginal equivalents of the English adverbs “here” and
“ there,”’ and their modifications, are frequently used as demon-
strative pronouns of the third person, and take the same declensions
as the nouns they qualify.
Conjunctions, interjections, and exclamations are not important
or numerous in this language, and will be passed over for the present.
Numerals,
One, guragun. Two, bulari. Several, umaka.
A MYSTIC OR SECRET LANGUAGE.
Before concluding this brief paper on the speech of the Aus-
tralian aborigines, I wish to refer to a secret language, used by the
men at the ceremonies of initiation, but is never spoken in the
presence of women, or in the presence of such youths as have not
passed through the necessary ceremonies. While the novices are
away in the bush with the elders of the tribe they are taught a
mystic name for surrounding objects, animals, parts of the human
body, and short phrases of general utility. This language varies in
different communities.


I have on several occasions drawn attention to tire existence of
this mystic tongue,* and five years ago I contributed to the Royal
Society of New South Wales t some short vocabularies of the secret
languages of the Kumu and Kamilaroi tribes.
In connection with this subject it may be mentioned that in 1901
I contributed an article to the Royal Geographical Society of Queens-
land on some “ Aboriginal Songs at Initiation Ceremonies.” J
SOCIOLOGY.
The Kumbainggeri-speaking people have a social organisation
consisting of four intermarrying divisions or sections. The masculine
and feminine forms of the names of the sections, showing how they
usually intermarry, and the names of the respective sections to which
the children belong, will be readily understood from the following
table:—
Cycle. Wife. Husband. Son. Daughter.
( Wirrakan Kurpoong Wirroong Wanggan
( Wanggan Marroong Womboong Wirrakan
U | Kooran Womboong Marroong Karragan
(Karragan Wirroong Kurpoong Kooran
To each of the above cycles there is an aggregate of totems at-
tached, consisting of animals, plants, and inanimate objects. The
totems of Cycle A belong to the sections Wirrakan and Wanggan in
common; and the totems of Cycle B are common to the sections
Kooran and Karragan. The descent of the cycles, sections, and
totems is invariably determined through the mothers only.
The marriages shown in the above table are the normal unions.
For example, a Wirrakan woman has a Kurpoong spouse, and her
children are Wirroong and Wanggan. She may, however, in certain
cases, marry a Marroong man, but her children would still be
Wirroong and Wanggan. Moreover, the Wirrakan woman of our
example could, instead of either of the above men, wed a Womboong
husband, provided she were not debarred by too close a blood relation-
ship ; or, she could take a Wirroong spouse, unless similarly debarred;
but her progeny would nevertheless be the same as in the above table,
quite regardless of the denomination of her husband.
INITIATION CEREMONIES.
The Kumbainggeri tribe possesses some important and imposing
ceremonies of initiation, of which I have given a comprehensive
account in a paper to the American Philosophical Society at Phila-
delphia, U.S.A.§ There is also an elementary form of initiation in
this tribe, which I have likewise described in an article contributed
to the Royal Geographical Society of Queensland* ||
