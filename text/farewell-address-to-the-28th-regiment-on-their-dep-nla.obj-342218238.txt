FAREWELL ADDRESS
TO THE
28th REGIMENT,
ON THEIR DEPARTURE TO INDIA:
SPOKEN AT THE
ROYAL VICTORIA THEATRE,
SYDNEY,
NEW “SOUTH'WALES,
ON THE
1842.
To-night Mock Catalan! re-appears
To greet his friends—an*office that endears :
For humble though has been the Author’s task,
’T is welcom’d : and what more can author ask ?
A kindly welcome, from indulgent friends,
Is rich reward, to all intents and ends.
Thus far Mock Catalan! ” makes his bow :
Another object has its author now :
To bid Farewell 1 unto a martial band.
About to leave us for Ind’s distant land;
To add fresh laurels to their old renown.
And guard the honour of the British Crown i
Make the fierce, false Affghans, in far Cabul,
Grow meek to and John Bull
They, with their steel array will heal the sore
Inflicted, but too deep, by Forty-Four.
Bold Sale, who keeps in awe the murd’rous
hashers,
Will hail, with warrior’s warmth, the gallant
“ Slashers ”
Iheir Chief will prove again their valour true,
Rememb’ring “Albuhera” 1—" Waterloo ” !!
The gallant " Slashers ” quit Australia’s shore,
And we may ne’er behold their phalanx more ;
Yet in our mem s ry will they linger long,
A beau ideal of the martial throng;
And many a gentle bosom, void of guile,
Will feel a pang—sweet lips will sadden’d smile.
Brave 1 Twenty-Eight,” who danger ne’er did
shun,
Farewell! Success we wish you ev’ry on©*
