THE AUSTRALIAN t>OLD DIGGINGS,
(PROM a CORRESPONDENT.)
SYDNEY, April 26.
The weekly produce of the gold diggings of New South
Wales and Victoria has averaged during the last two
months nearly 30,000 ounces, which, at 645. per ounce,
gives a sum of 106,000?. per week, I speak only of that
amount of gold which comes to market by means of the
Government escorts and mails. It is understood that a
large quantity of the precious metal is ?planted? in the
bush; indeed, the most incredible stories are current among
gold-diggers with reference to the actual produce of the
mines. You will observe that the yield of Mount Alexander
is infinitely greater than that of the Turon or any of the
New South Wales gold-fields. It is in the proportion of
3J to 1. This is accounted for by the more central posi-
tion of the Victoria diggings, which have attracted an im-
mense population from Sydney, Van Diemen?s Land, and
South Australia, of which a very considerable proportion
are convicts. Our southern neighbours have consequently
suffered some rather serious disturbances of the public
peace, while Sydney has been in no way affected by the
gold discovery in that respect. Our lives are as quiet and
orderly as they were 12 months ago, and though the popu-
lation is of a more mixed and motley character, including
now men of almost every variety of race, language, and
costume, still we pursue the even tenour of our way, and,
except in the gold auction-rooms, little or no excitement is
visible. Even there, men have become so used to handle
the precious ? tinsel ? that, unless some very beautiful
specimen is presented to view, they exhibit no more curio-
sity than you would at a sale of corn at Mark-lane.
Meanwhile, the benefit of the discovery is beginning to
be felt among all ranks, although it is not without its
drawbacks. The non-advent of the tide of immigration
which was expected has had the effect of raising consider-
ably the price of hired labour. Domestic servants, in par-
ticular, are scarcer than ever, women especially. Ladies
are obliged to scrub their own floors, cook their own din-
ners, go out with their children, and perform in general
every office usually filled by menials. The more wealthy
employ Chinese as footboys or nursery maids, to the great
edification, no doubt, of the young idea. The Celestials,
however, are found to give infinite trouble, and to cost
more in management than even the worthless pauper or the
hardened felon.
One of the most satisfactory features about Australian
gold digging is the very general disposition of the successful
miners to invest their earnings in real estate. Homesteads
are eagerly sought after by the men who have laboured for a
few months in the rivers and creeks; domestic considerations
prevail over the speculative ambition, and, unlike the gam-
bling. roving, Californian, the Australian gold digger has

no sooner filled his pockets, than he sets to work to settle
his wife comfortably in a cottage with a neat garden,
reserving to himself the ultima ratio of another visit to the
mines, in case his little farming or storekeeping speculation
should turn out unsuccessful. I do not wish to write coideur
de rose, hut this is actually true. So mar ked is the difference
between the position of a benedict and a bachelor in a new
colony, that, despite the ruinous effects of 50 years of felony,
domestic relations and domestic virtues are rapidly growing
up among us, and the dreadful remembrances attached to
a populus virorum are fast fading away.
I have been led away from the subject with which I
began?namely, the produce of our gold-fields ; but before
I close this letter I will give you the returns of the quar-
terly revenues of New South Wales and Victoria, showing
the enormous increase on last year, owing to the gold dis-
covery :

Ihe enormous increase in the Crown revenue of the
southern colony is attributable mainly to the gold dis-
covery.
The proceeds of gold licenses for the quarter is set down
at 48,597 1. 135, Fees for gold escort, 4,489f. 19s. sd. Sale
of Crown lands, 94,273�., or an increase of 9,700 per cent.
on the corresponding quarter of last year.
These enormous ** Crown? revenues are at the absolute
disposal of the Executive, since Lord Grey has declined
giving instructions about them. A motion will be fnade by
Mr. Wentworth, early in the ensuing session, with the
view of getting the Crown revenue turned over to the Legis-
lature. The supplies are to be voted for this year; but
notice is to be given that next year not a stiver will be
granted, except the whole revenues oi the colony are at
once surrendered. Victoria will, of course, follow our ex-
example. So that the Colonial-office had better sal its
house in order betimes.
