Imperial Federation (Defence) Committee,
This Committee adopts the following Resolutions passed by the Con-
ference which founded the Imperial Federation League in 1884 :
That in order to secure the permanent unity of the Empire some
form of Federation is essential.
That no scheme of Federation should interfere with the existing
rights of Local Parliaments as regards local affairs.
That any scheme of Imperial Federation should combine on an
equitable basis the resources of the Empire for the main-
tenance of common interests, and adequately provide for an
organised defence of common rights.
It also adopts the expansion of the principles of those Resolutions by
the Special Committee of 1892, as expressed in the summary taken from
the Report adopted by the Council of the Imperial Federation League in
the same year.
In particular, the Committee recognises as the lesson to be drawn
from the experience of the nine years? working of the late League
x. That an adequate system of Maritime Defence is the primary
necessity common to all parts of the Empire.
2. That such a system of defence does not exist under present
conditions.
3. That, given a common system of Maritime Defence, provided
by all parts of the Empire, the most essential point in
the Federation of the Empire is attained.
4. That combination for the defence of common interests is there-
fore?as was recognised in 1884 ?the one essential point, and
the test of the practicability of Imperial Federation.
5. That if the self-governing Colonies take their share in the cost
of such a system of defence, they must eventually be placed
in a position to exercise some supervision over the appro-
priation of the money contributed by them ; and if
those Colonies be not willing to take their share in a com-
mon system of defence, it is evident that federation is not
practicable, whatever arrangements may be proposed or
adopted as regards interchange of commerce, means of
intercommunication, monetary standards, etc.
6. That proposals involving participation in the cost of general
maritime security, which has hitherto been enjoyed by those
Colonies without expense, cannot be expected to come, in
the first instance, from Colonial Governments.
It will therefore be the first aim of the Committee to call the attention
of the people of the United Kingdom to the anomalous and precarious
state of affairs now existing, and to induce Her Majesty?s Government
to make to those Colonial Governments, in an official manner, such state-
ments as to the present means by which defence is provided, and such
proposals regarding the future, as will elicit from them an expression as to
their willingness to take part in such a combination.
In order to narrow the issue as much as possible, and thereby to
concentrate effort upon this one essential point, it is specifically declared
that the objects of the Committee do not include any proposal involving
an alteration of the fiscal policy either of the United Kingdom or of any
of the Colonies.


JSTo. 12
PROGRESS IN 1897.
The rejoicings which took place in London during the past
year, and with which the representatives of the Colonies were
so prominently associated, temporarily precluded the prosecution
of the controversy raised by the Committee upon the position of
the Colonies with regard to the defence of the Empire; neverthe-
less they were made the occasion of important steps in the
direction which has been steadily indicated by the Committee
as the only one by which the Federation of the Empire, upon
any basis possessing the essential qualification of permanence,
can be attained.
Two Points Scored.
The naval and military displays cannot have failed to impress
upon the Colonial mind the very solid advantages which pertain
to membership of the British- Empire, as well as the fact that
an Empire cannot be defended without great expendi-
ture. The expressions of goodwill and fellowship, and of readi-
ness to take their share in the responsibilities of the Empire, which
were heard on all sides from Colonial speakers, were undoubtedly
gratifying to English ears. But there stand out from these
demonstrations two material facts upon which the Committee
may be congratulated, as the direct result of its operations and
of those of the Imperial Federation League.
The first, that the Secretary of State for the Colonies,
in his Conference with the Premiers, practically adopted the
standpoint of this Committee.
And secondly, that the Parliament of Cape Colony has


declared by resolution that the Colony should contribute to
the maintenance of the Navy.
The Secretary of State for the Colonies on
Imperial Federation for Defence.
As regards the first point, the Secretary of State declared to
the Conference that ?there is a real necessity for some better
machinery of consultation between the self-governing Colonies
and the Mother Country,? and proposed to the Premiers ?that
it might be feasible to create a great Council of the Empire
to which the Colonies would send representative plenipoten-
tiaries.?
Mr. Chamberlain then proceeded to identify himself still
more closely with the position of the Committee. He placed
Imperial Defence ? in the very first rank ? of Federal ques-
tions to be dealt with by that body, showed the enormous cost
of the Royal Navy to British taxpayers, and pointed out that it
is ?not maintained exclusively, or even mainly, for the benefit
of the United Kingdom, or for the benefit of home interests
. . every war, great or small, in which we have been
engaged, having had at the bottom a Colonial interest.? He
declared that ? nothing could be more suicidal than for any
of those great groups of Colonies to neglect themselves
to take their fair share in the protective resources of the
Mother Country.? Finally, having urged upon the Premiers
? that we have a common interest in the matter,? he invited those
assembled with him to express themselves as to the willingness of
their Colonies to contribute to the maintenance of the Navy, in
the following words: ?? I shall be very glad to hear the views
of the Premiers in regard to this question of any contribution
which they think the Colonies would be willing to make in
order to establish this principle in regard to the naval
defence of the Empire.?
Mr. Chamberlain has redeemed his Pledge.
It cannot be denied that Mr. Chamberlain has very amply
fulfilled the promise which he gave to the Committee in 1895,


that the matters brought before him in the Address of this
Committee to Her Majesty?s Ministers (Pamphlet No. 5) should
have his anxious attention.
Not only were the arguments used by the Secretary of State
upon this occasion identical with those which have been put
forward by the Committee during the past four years, but the
definite suggestion made by him for the establishment of a
Council of the Empire, and the inquiry as to the willingness
of the Colonies to contribute to the naval defence of the
Empire, are precisely those steps which were originally suggested
by the Imperial Federation League, and which the Committee has
since been engaged in pressing upon Her Majesty?s Government.
Colonial Ministers Unprepared.
The replies of the Colonial Ministers to this very distinct
suggestion of the Secretary of State were not such as might have
been expected by those who had listened to the fervid de-
clarations of loyalty and support which formed the
Staple of Jubilee orations. Nevertheless it should be remem-
bered, in justice to the Colonies, that the Premiers had not come
to London for the purpose of dealing with this very weighty ques-
tion, and that they were not, therefore, in a position to
give a reply which would commit them to any definite
action.
With regard to the question of the establishment ot an
Imperial Council, the resolution adopted by a majority of the
Premiers was as follows : ? That the present political relations
between the United Kingdom and the self-governing Colonies are
generally satisfactory under the existing condition of things.?
A Difference of Opinion.
Two of the Premiers dissented from this proposition, ? being
of opinion that the time had already come when an effort
should be made to render more formal the political ties between
the United Kingdom and the Colonies.?
In the course of the discussion consequent upon this diver-
gence of opinion, it appeared that ? the majority of the Premiers
were not yet prepared to adopt this position, but there was a


strong feeling amongst some of them that with the rapid growth
of population in the Colonies, the present relations could not
Continue indefinitely, but that some means would have to be
devised for giving the Colonies a voice in the control and
direction of those questions of Imperial interest in which
they are concerned equally with the Mother Country.?
The Premiers also adopted a resolution that it would be
desirable to hold periodical Conferences of representatives of
the Colonies and Great Britain for the discussion of matters of
common interest.
Contributions to the Navy.
No direct reply appears to have been given to the suggestion
as to contributions to the Navy, and it need surprise no one to
hear that the Premiers were unprepared with an assurance of
the readiness of their Colonies to initiate an expenditure to which
they were not accustomed, and as to which they had not as yet
been consulted. The report of the Conference states, however,
that ?it was recognised at the same time that (such) a share
in the direction of Imperial policy would involve a proportionate
contribution in aid of Imperial expenditure, for which, at
present at any rate, the Colonies generally are not prepared.?
Contribution the Means of Combination.
This latter quotation from the Official Report, which may
be assumed to summarise with accuracy the purport of a lengthy
discussion, shows very clearly the correctness of the view held
by this Committee that the financial question must be regarded
as lying at the root of any proposals for Imperial Federation.
The importance which has been attached by the Committee to
the establishment of the principle of some contribution to
general expenditure as a means of combination, is thus
fully justified.
It will be remembered that the stress laid by the Committee
upon this aspect of the question was at first deprecated in many
quarters, as being likely to alienate the sympathies of the
Colonies; but the arguments, of which the Committee was
at that time the only exponent, are now freely used by


Cabinet Ministers* and by the Press, while the statements of
the Committee are referred to as facts which, in any case, must
be reckoned with at no distant date, and this necessity has now
been admitted by the Premiers of the Colonies.
A Federation without Funds.
Stated briefly, it is coming to be recognised that while, on the
one hand, no federation of the Empire is possible without
a common fund from which its expenditure shall be defrayed,
so, on the other hand, the establishment of such a fund, with
the necessary machinery for its administration, at once provides
a solid basis upon which the Federation may be built.
Contributions to the Navy mean the Federa-
tion of the Empire.
From the date of the dissolution of the Imperial Federation
League, in 1893, the Committee has put forward the general
defence of the Empire as the object for which the countries of
the Empire would most naturally and readily combine their re-
sources, and it indicates the Royal Navy as the particular means
of defence with which a commencement in combination could
be most conveniently made. The value of the Navy to the
Empire is brought home to all its citizens, and upon the
Navy they all rely for protection.
The Step must be followed up.
During the past year the Committee has had the satisfaction
of seeing the commencement of negotiations leading to the pro-
vision of a common fund for the maintenance of a truly
Imperial Navy. The inquiry of the Secretary of State, made at
this informal gathering, as to the willingness of the Colonies to con-
tribute to the Navy, may be regarded as the official opening of
this great question, to be followed at the first convenient op-
portunity by action of a more direct and deliberate character. It
will be the function of this Committee to prepare the ground for
such action by spreading accurate information as to the facts, and
by making use of the powerful arguments which they afford for

a speedy settlement of this question upon a lasting and equitable
basis.
Cape Colony recognises its Responsibilities.
The second achievement of the past year, which may be
fairly traced to the exertions of this Committee, is the declaration
by the Parliament of the Cape Colony ?that the time has
arrived when steps should be taken to arrange some
basis of contribution by the Cape Colony towards the
Imperial Navy.? This resolution was adopted some months
before the Conference of the Premiers, and nothing could be
more satisfactory than the direct and unqualified terms in which
it states the responsibility of the Colony, as part of the British
Empire, for the proper maintenance of the Navy which protects
the Empire as a whole.
A Practical Example from South Africa.
The Premier of the Cape Colony took occasion during his
visit to this country, to put into definite shape the wishes of hi s
Colony thus generally expressed, and stated the intention of the
Colony to present an ironclad to the Royal Navy. Since
his return to the Colony the question has been raised whether a
regular annual contribution would not be more suitable than
the isolated gift of a battleship. The annual contribution has
throughout been the form advocated by this Committee, not
only because it would be a constantly recurring sign of Colonial
interest in the Royal Navy, but also because it would tend to place
the Colonial contributor,/n? tanto , upon an equal footing with the
taxpayer of the United Kingdom, and would pave the way for the
common fund required to form the basis of a permanent
union. It is a satisfactory feature of the preparations now
being made for a General Election at the Cape, that both parties
declare in favour of a substantial contribution to the Navy.*
The Committee stands upon sure Ground.
A deputation from the Imperial Federation (Defence) Commit-
tee had the pleasure of waiting upon Sir Gordon Sprigg, and

annual contribution of per annum.


conveying to him the congratulations of the Committee and their
supporters upon the action of the Colony which he represented. In
the course of his reply, the Premier of Cape Colony expressed
his appreciation of the correctness of the Committee?s policy in
the following words : ?? Gentlemen, I feel that in taking up the
position which you do, you are standing upon sure ground.
I can see that the unity of the Empire may be worked
out on the grounds that you rely upon? this question of
Imperial Defence.?
The precise form of the Cape contribution remains unsettled,
but the fact which concerns the Committee is the recognition
by the Cape Parliament of its responsibilities towards the Imperial
Navy.
Colonial Naval He serves.
Proposals have been made for the establishment of Naval
Reserves in certain Colonies, the maintenance of these forces to
be regarded as the Colonial contribution to the Navy. The
subject has been pressed in Canada, but up to the present time
the Admiralty has not been able to adopt any of the plans put
forward. It is understood that the proposal involves the payment
by the British taxpayer of the Colonial Reserve men.
Meanwhile the existence of the Canadian Pacific Railway
continues to be put forward in some quarters as a sufficient
contribution by Canada to its maritime defence. There are
not wanting, however, in Canada, men who repudiate this
suggestion, and express their earnest desire that Canada
should take her share in the maintenance of the Navy.
Military Interchanges.
Upon the military side of Imperial Defence it is gratifying
to note that an interchange of duties has taken place between
the Royal Artillery stationed at Halifax and the Canadian
Artillery at Quebec; while the proposal to repatriate the Royal
Canadian Regiment (100 th) by establishing a recruiting Depot
for the Regiment in Canada, has been favourably received by
the Canadian Government, and is now under consideration
by the War Office.

DEPUTATION TO THE PREMIER OP CAPE COLONY
Address from the Imperial Federation {Defence) Committee upon the
Contribution of Cape Colony to the Navy.


SUMMARY OF THE CASE.
The Royal Navy protects the Commerce of
the entire Empire. The value of
this commerce is ... ... �1,204,000,000
The Sea-borne Commerce of the United
Kingdom is ... ... ... ... �766,000,000
The Sea-borne Commerce of the self-
governing Colonies is ... ... �222,000,000
Thus it will be seen that Colonial commerce forms ONE-
FIFTH of the total trade of the Empire.
For the Naval protection of the trade of
the Empire there is paid an annual
sum of ... ... ... ... �25,224,000
Of the above total, the United Kingdom
pays ... ... �24,734,000
Self-governing Colonies in North America,
Australasia, and South Africa, pay �177,000
Thus it will be seen that the Colonies, which possess ONE-
FIFTH of the trade, contribute less than ONE-HUNDREDTH
of the cost of protecting the trade. NINETY-EIGHT
HUNDREDTHS are contributed by the taxpayers of the
United Kingdom.
The following table shows the revenue and population
of the United Kingdom and the self-governing Colonies
respectively :
REVENUE. POPULATION.
United Kingdom �104,000,000 ... 39,000,000
Self-governing Colonies �46,000,000 ... 12,000,000
It will thus be seen that though the Colonies contribute
less than one-hundredth part of the cost of the Naval
Defence of the Empire, their population is close upon ONE-
THIRD of that of the United Kingdom, and their revenue
is nearly HALF that of the United Kingdom.

?Again X say, nothing could be more suicidal or more
fatal than for any of those great groups of Colonies either to
separate themselves in the present stage from the protecting
forces of the Mother Country, or to neglect themselves to
take their fair share in those protective resources. The
Right Hon. JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN, M.P., Secretary of State for the Colonies,
June 24th, 1897.
?As Chancellor of the Exchequer, I am bound to put
before you the fact that forty millions of people in the
United Kingdom pay twenty-two millions a year for the
cost of our common Navy; while ten millions of people of
the same race in our Colonies pay but a few thousands a
year and find but a very few men. That cannot and ought
not to be a permanent settlement of the relations between
the great self-governing Colonies and the United Kingdom.
I do not think for a moment that, conscious of
t.lioit* power as great nationalities, they wuuld wish to
shirk those responsibilities on the ground on which formerly
they might fairly have claimed exemption when struggling
and poor communities. It is a matter on which Her Mhjesty s
Government and the Governments of the Colonies ought to
take council together speedily, and I hope and trust that
it may be settled by some satisfactory conclusion. The Right
Hon. Sir MICHAEL HICKS-BEACH, Bart., M.P., Chancellor of the Exchequer,
June 30th, 1897.
? In these recent times the doings of many rival nations,
justifiably anxious themselves to promote their own
Colonial interests, make it all the more necessary that in
every corner of the Empire it should be felt that there are
common joint interests which can best be defended by
joint contributions to a Fleet which represents the Empire
at large.??The Right Hon. J. G. GOSCHEN, M.P., First Lord of the Admiralty,
July 10th, 1897.
