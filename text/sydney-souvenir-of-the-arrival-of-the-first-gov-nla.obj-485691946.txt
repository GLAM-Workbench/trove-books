SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA —The Queen of the South Pacific.
fYDNEY, the capital of the State of New South Wales, is the largest city in Australasia, and
the principal commercial centre of the South Pacific. Its population, which in 1908
numbered 577,000, is as numerous as that of Birmingham or Baltimore ; the value of its
ratable property is greater than that of any other city in the British Empire, except
London.
From its situation on the shores of the peerless harbour of Port Jackson, Sydne\
has the distinction of being one of the most picturesque cities in the world. The chief
business and shopping centre is built upon the southern shore, and the principal
thoroughfares debouch upon the deepwater frontage of Circular Quay, where mammoth
ocean liners lie berthed side by side with the swift harbour ferries which bring the
waterside suburbs within ten to twenty minutes of the heart of the metropolis. Fast-
growing residential suburbs are spreading along the harbour front, where pleasant villas, built on the dark,
verdure-clad hills, look down upon the snow-white sails of scudding yachts or puffing tugs heaving on tow-lines
at the end of which huge steamers lunge sluggishly up the mighty port.
The splendid buildings of the city, with their domes and spires and massive blocks of handsome
structures, built of the warm light-brown sandstones which form Sydney’s foundations, impress the stranger,
on his voyage up the fairway from the harbour heads, with a metropolitan air as of some old-world capital.
The institutions of Sydney are of a kind to do credit to any city. Ihe public buildings are palatial m
which the leading schools of architecture are worthily represented, from the Italian Renaissance of the 1 ost
Office and the Lands Department to the Classic simplicity of the Art Gallery, and the Tudor battlements o
Government House. Sydney University, of which the Great Hall is a fine example of the Perpendicular Gothic,


provides instruction comparable with that of the best universities of the old world and America ; the schools and
colleges are of a high standard ; splendid cathedrals and churches adorn the capital ; while traffic is provided for
by swift electric trams connecting with the railways, which, like the tram-service, are owned by the State.
Industrially, Sydney is already great, and is destined to be greater. Its trade, reckoned by imports and exports,
reaches annually. A coal seam underlying the city and harbour is now being worked, and the
ceaseless clang of hammers on the anvils of dockyards tells of healthy maritime industry, for this is the port
whence is shipped the famous New South Wales merino wool, and the wheat, butter, mutton, coal, silver, gold,
and other products of the generous soil of a State whose million and a half inhabitants produce annually as
much as £3B per head.
Sydney’s magnificent climate and beautiful surroundings place it above any other city in the world, from a
residential point of view. The temperature has a range of only 17 degrees Fahr. between average summer and
winter weather. Snow and biting cold are alike unknown, and artificial heating is little needed ; while an
occasional hot day in summer brings its own remedy in the shape of a “southerly buster” of cool wind, which
sweeps up the coast, laden with the freshness of the southern ocean.
Great as .Sydney has become as the leading commercial centre of Australia, it may with justice be regarded
as a holiday city. Magnificent ocean beaches fringe the metropolis along the Pacific littoral, to which Sydney
residents repair in thousands to enjoy the delightful sport of surf-bathing in the “ long wash of Australasian
seas.” Within twenty miles to the north and south lie the two great national forest reserves of Kuring-gai Chase
and National Park, each including nearly 35,000 acres, forming glorious recreation spaces for Sydney’s citizens.
The superb climate, which makes open-air life enjoyable at every season of the year, causes these splendid
natural facilities to be availed of to the full. The magnificent gorges and leaping waterfalls of the Blue Mountains,
at an elevation of over 3,000 feet, are only 60 miles west of the metropolis, and provide a complete change of
climate and scene at the cost of a couple of hours’ train journey. All the .State railways radiate from Sydney,
which is, from its position, the natural tourist centre of Australia.
Persons who are interested in this great city of the Southern Seas, or in the industrial, commercial, and
tourist possibilities of the State of which it is the capital, may obtain full information from the New South Wales
Intelligence Department, or from its branch, the Government Tourist Bureau, with offices in Martin Place, Sydney.

South Wales.


'HE State of New South Wales comprises a territory of magnificent resources.
It has, in the short period of a century and a quarter, achieved a great deal,
and has, in fact, accomplished much that would reflect credit upon any of
the countries of the old world. It presents a wonderful opportunity to the
immigrant and investor, while its health and tourist resorts are unequalled,
i ranging as they do from the sub-tropical wonders of the great and fertile
North Coast to the Alpine regions of Mount Kosciusko —the St. Moritz of
I Australia —and the Southern garden of the State, the Illawarra and South
Coast district.
Even more famous are the marvellous limestone cave systems of Jenolan, Wombeyan and Yarran-
gobilly, all of which absolutely baffle description ; the dozen caves already opened up at Jenolan have been
rendered easily accessible by well-formed paths, ladders, steps, protecting railing, &c. These caverns are a
glorious fairyland of palaces, crystal cities, cathedrals, grottoes, frozen waterfalls and jewelled formations of
every imaginable description, festooned with the most delicate rock draperies, whose colors vary from the
deepest chocolate to the purest white. They are also noted for their beautiful apricot and yellow shades.
Of the Blue Mountains much has been written, but their scenic glories and wonders will never fail
to charm all beholders, and fill with awe and wonder the traveller from afar. Situated 40 miles westward
of Sydney, a couple of hours run by train is all that is necessary to land the tourist from 3,000 to 4,000 feet


above sea level, amid these vast hills and their picturesque surroundings and superb health resorts. Here
the rivers of the tableland have been ceaselessly working through countless ages, carving out the vast gorges,
and leaving giant cliffs on all sides.
Through a very network of ranges, with fifteen fine towns spread over and occupying various emin-
ences, each having its own series of beautiful waterfalls, ferny glades, awe-inspiring canyons, cliffs and
olhei attractions, the Blue Mountains of New South Wales will always be famed for that ever-present thin
blue mist enveloping them. Whether viewed from the vicinity or from afar—even 50 miles distant—these
fine lolling hills, ridge upon ridge, are always true to their most apt designation. Perhaps their greatest
charm and interest will ever remain in the fact that they are the " Blue ” Mountains.
In the morning the mountain mists ascend from the valleys in billowy fashion, and are dispersed as
the day advances, to later gather at eventide and enshroud the horizon in deepening veils of indigo.
The State of New South Wales is equally fortunate in the possession of other world-renowned resorts,
and particularly in its fine rivers and harbours. Of these, mention must be made of Sydney Harbour,
-chosen by engineers of all lands as the world’s finest harbour. Possessing a shore-line of 200 miles, fringed
with innumerable golden sandy beaches, several picturesquely placed islands, two fine rivers, and Middle
Harbour with its placid upper reaches, ever winding its sinuous course amid high wooded hills, Port Jackson
is surely nature’s finest and most exquisite work.
Further afield is the Hawkesbury River, which Anthony Trollope places before the Rhine and the
Mississippi, a majestic stream offering the best of camping, fishing, shooting and boating, and, in very


truth, a paradise for holiday-makers in search of rest and health, and for those who would seek the golden
splendour of *he bush and enter the domain of birdland.
Financially, New South Wales is as sound as a bell. Her oversea trade, including Inter-State Com-
merce, approximates £100,000,000. The Banks at the end of 1913 held deposits totalling £91,000,000. Of
this sum, £32,000,000 was deposited in the Government Savings Banks —an average of nearly £47 per
depositor. The net earnings of the Railways, owned by the State, amounted to £2,332,421 last year. The
agricultural production was valued at £11,816,000, and the value of the minerals produced exceeded
£11,600,000.
New South Wales is also famous as one of the greatest wool-producing countries in the world. In
1913, the 40,000,000 sheep in the State produced between 300,000,000 and 400,000,000 lbs. of wool, of which
262,808,000 lbs., worth £11,700,000 were exported oversea.
The 5,343 manufactories in 1913, employed 120,586 hands —93,105 of whom were males —who drew
£12,676,993 in wages, while the value of the output exceeded £61,000,000.
The foregoing figures provide an illustration of the industry of the State’s virile population, which
to-day numbers but 1,844,000.
Of the 310,367 square miles only 3,737,269 acres are as yet under cultivation.
Millions of acres of rich land still yearn for the plough, and a hearty welcome will be given the agri-
culturist and the irrigationist. The latter will, of course, need to be possessed of some means, in return


for which the land of his adoption will offer him his choice of some of the finest irrigation lands in the world
on well established irrigation areas.
Chief of these is the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area, a vast land settlement and gigantic engineering
project—a Government undertaking—now well established, and upon which about £3,000,000 has been
expended to date.
Though still in its infancy, several hundred farmers are settled upon the area, who are already
reaping the reward of their labour. The Murrumbidgee Irrigation scheme is designed to provide 7,500
blocks, and is estimated to eventually support 100,000 people upon its 250,000 acres of irrigable land,
supplemented by a million acres of “ dry ” or non-irrigable land.
New South Wales is on the eve of tremendous developments, and is at the present juncture com-
mitted to other great irrigation projects, also a vigorous railway and public works policy. Closer settlement
will go hand-in-hand with these undertakings, several large estates—some of which are over a hundred
thousand acres in extent—having already been acquired by the Government with the view of settling the
people on small farms.
