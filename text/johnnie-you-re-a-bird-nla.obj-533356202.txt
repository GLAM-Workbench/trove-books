On the Wings of Progress
NEVER before has world acclamation rung
so true as it rings out to-day for
Amy Johnson. To-day, she is symbolical
of progress—of individual achievement in the
conquest of the air by flight.
No other woman has ever attempted, much
less succeeded, in the ambitious feat which
Miss Johnson has now made fact.
It is this pioneer spirit that has carried
radio from a laboratory experiment to a
commercial actuality.

Does “Johnnie’s” Triumph
make you want to Fly?
uow simple must ordinary flying be if a girl
with no greater equipment than a Gipsy Moth,
a little experience, much common-sense, and ex-
ceptional bravery, can fly as Miss Johnson has
flown during the past few weeks!
Across Europe and Asia to Australia —alone
with her machine and her nerve —on a journey
which has always seemed to previous genera-
tions like a transition from one world to an-
other. Yet she has compassed it with as great
modesty as though the feat were nothing.
Can ordinary flying be difficult if such a feat
is possible? Your reason says that it cannot,
and experience agrees with your reason.
A normal pupil needs less than ten hours of
flying tuition before qualifying for a private
pilot’s license. p f»‘j» I
Not even age is a bar. Recently a gentleman
68 years old learnt to fly.
The de Havilland Gipsy Moth—the ’plane
which Miss Johnson and many other long-dis-
tance solo flyers have used —is the standard train-
ing machine for most of the world.
The Gipsy Moth is extremely simple to con-
trol. By moving the control stick backwards or
forwards, you make the ’plane rise or dip; by
moving it to the left or right, you make the
’plane bank to the left or right; you steer with
your feet; and you increase or decrease speed
by moving - the throttle lever forwards or back-
wards.
Learning to fly costs little. The N.S.W. Aero
Club has many training machines and instruc-
tors, and all the year round is instructing a suc-
cession of private pupils —some learning as a
hobby, others in preparation for owning Moths.
A Gipsy Moth costs no more to buy than a
moderately priced car; is more economical in
petrol consumption than many popular cars;
cruises at over 80 miles an hour; and has a maxi-
mum speed exceeding 100 miles an hour.
One person can start it alone and handle it
on the ground alone. The wings fold right back,
so that an ordinary garage is wide enough to
house it.
Let the example of Miss Johnson inspire you
to learn to fly. If you wish to know more about
private flying, we will send you, on request, a
copy of the de Havilland booklet, “Flying One’s
Own ’Plane.”
The DH aeroplanes which are of greatest in-
terest to private owners are the two-seater
GIPSY Moth, the two-three-seater PUSS Moth,
and the six-seater HAWK Moth. The number
of Gipsy Moths in Australia exceeds that of all
other light ’planes put together.

A WONDER GIRL’S EPIC FLIGHT
{The following message is from Sir Keith Smith, who, with his gallant brother, the late
Sir Ross Smith, and two equally gallant companions, Lieut, Skiers and Lieut. Bennett,
made the first flight from England to Australia in 192?, thus blazing an aerial trail half
way round the world. — Ed.)
(By SIR KEITH SMITH.)
1 AM honoured by the invitation to write for the Sports
Girls’ Souvenir Book, of Miss Amy Johnson’s won-
derful flight, and I do so with a great deal of pleasure,
because I know from personal experience some of the
hard and tiring work she has done, and of the many
difficulties she has had to face and overcome to fulfil her
ambition. This ambition she accomplished magnifi-
cently when she landed at Port Darwin on Empire Day.
The planning of a flight such as hers is not the work
of a moment; it calls for a close study of the route, of the
weather likely to be encountered, the selection of suitable
maps, the arranging for petrol and oil depots at landing
grounds suitable distances apart, together with provision
for supplies at emergency grounds in the event of storms
or headwinds forcing the pilot to make a temporary land-
ing. In addition there is a vast multitude of vital details
which must be gone into and finalised if one is to success-
fully accomplish the aerial journey from England to Aus-
tralia in anything like record time.
No words of mine can express my admiration for Miss
Johnson’s flight, calling as it has for great skill, pluck
and endurance, especially during the latter stages when
troubles delayed her triumphant progress. It is then that
her determination to succeed became strikingly apparent,
and that she carried on in face of disappointment and
fatigue is a great tribute to British womanhood, and a
shining example of British pluck in the face of adversity.
Once more the outstanding qualities of British aircraft
and engines and the reliance that can be placed upon them
have been amply demonstrated, and “Jason’s Quest ’ de-
serves its share of praise for bringing Miss Johnson safely
over the long miles of difficulty and danger that separate
us from London, the heart of our great Empire.
Miss Johnson’s flight has attracted world-wide atten-
tion, and it will, I hope, finally convince the doubters of
the great, and as yet undeveloped, possibilities of Commer-
cial Aviation, not only in Australia, but throughout the
world.
All Australia has been thrilled by this lone girl flyer
fighting her way to success, and we give place to no one in
our admiration for what she has done.
I count it a great privilege to write this foreword and
to be allowed to express my great personal admiration of
the most wonderful aerial achievement of the age.
—KEITH SMITH.

ULM’S PRAISE OF GIRL ACE
Who will ever forget that soul-stirring flight of the Southern Cross over thousands of miles of the dark Pacific? Could
time ever dim the memories of those hours of breathless suspense as we, the public, crouched over our radio sets in the
dead of night, following in fearful fascination the epic flight of four valiant airmen winging their way over dreary wastes,
defying the mysterious unknown into which had plunged so many of their gallant fellow-airmen never to return. From the
blackness~of night came cheery messages, as though from some careless joyriders of the air, so that the mind grasped only
dimly the magnitude of the heroism and skill of those birdmen flying through storm and darkness over, at one stage alone,
three thousand miles of unbroken ocean—an unparalleled achievement even amongst the super-men of the air. Their tumul-
tuous welcome at the end of their journey was a nation’s expression of praise and thanksgiving for their safe arrival.
Mr. C. T. P. Ulm, who shared with Kingsford Smith the leadership and initiative that overcame all obstacles, here writes in
glowing praise and admiration of "Johnnie.” — F.N.R. [Editor).
(By Flight-Lieutenant C. T. P. Ulm, A.F.C.)
It gives me very great pleasure to
accept the invitation to write a preface
for this magazine booklet, which is
being published in honour of Miss
Amy Johnson, the world-renowned
Aviatrix, who has completed the most
spectacular and difficult long-distance
flight ever undertaken by a woman.
I feel that I must commence my
remarks with a complete and full
apology to Miss Johnson, for I am one
of the large majority of men who,
knowing something of flying, never
believed that she would be able to
successfully complete the big job
upon which she had embarked.
Except for Bert Hinkler’s epic flight
to Australia, and Lindberg’s Trans-
Atlantic flight, Miss Johnson’s flight
differs from all other long-distance
flights, in that she carried out the whole
job by herself.
We learn that from the very moment
she decided to make the flight she was
beset with difficulties: the first—and gen-
erally ever-present one for flying people
—being the difficulty in securing financial
backing for what the “man in the street”
considers to be a hazardous stunt flight.
After this hurdle had been safely nego-
tiated, Miss Johnson, quite apart from
being inexperienced in flights of the type
she was to undertake, realised that it
would be necessary for her to have a very
thorough understanding of both her air-
craft and her engine if she were to get
safely through, and much of the credit
due to her flight expedition as a whole
must be given to her in the early stages
of her organising work, when she went
to a great deal of trouble and inconveni-
ence to become thoroughly familiar with
the mechanical and engineering features
of her machine.
That she was able to secure her Ground
Engineer’s licenses in a comparatively
short period, shows that right from the
beginning she realised what a big job was
ahead of her, and that she made up her
mind to master every subject which could
help her on the flight.
The next step—and one of which to date
we have heard very little—is the question
of Navigation; and, as I understand that
Miss Johnson had only done two or three
comparatively short cross-country flights
prior to commencing her flight to Aus-
tralia, one must assume that she devoted
some time prior to her flight in studying
this subject.
Miss Johnson’s attention to detail prior
to the actual commencement of her flight
is most creditable, and stamps her as one
far above the average in flying and all
things pertaining thereto.
After the actual commencement of her
flight from England, it was quite apparent
that very few people seriously considered
that she would safely reach Australia, and
many, like myself, feared for her safety.
Although, during the first few days of her
flight, only meagre reports reached us, all
indicating that Miss Johnson had had no-
th. ng but smooth running, and unevent-
ful trips, I know, as one who has flown
over the route in the other direction, that
even during the first few days of her
flight, she must have had a most strenu-
ous time.
It is a big job for a strong and healthy
man to tackle, roughly, 1000 miles flying
daily, and it is nothing less than astound-
ing to note the remarkable progress which
Miss Johnson made prior to the regret-
table mishap she experienced near Ran-
goon.
There is one section of her flight out
which appealed very greatly to me, and
that was when Miss Johnson landed in
the desert, as she was unable to safely
battle through very heavy sand and dust
storms.
A less capable pilot might easily have
attempted to go through the weather Miss
Johnson experienced, and either have lost
his or her way, or come to grief when
effecting a landing under such circum-
stances. This incident, apart from the
extraordinary pluck and perseverance Miss
Johnson has shown throughout her flight,
was a concrete demonstration of her

THE GODDESS OF FLIGHT
LADY Empress of the Sky,
Whose winged fame shall never
die,
We welcome you with heart and hand,
to this, our own beloved land!
Since first you left your native shore,
High in the home of birds to soar.
Our anxious minds have followed you,
The while a whole world’s wonder
grew.
How splendid that so slight a thing
Should fearlessly, alone, take wing
And soar so swiftly in her grace
Through imperilled spheres of
space!
The voyage done, now you are here —
Let ev’ry throat combine to cheer.
Let ev’ry tongue contrive to cry :
“Welcome, O Empress of the Sky!”

Somebody’s Typiste
The little typiste from Hull, who stepped into her ’plane in England, waved a cheery
“Good-bye,” and, defying th e elements, smug masculine perogatives, and all other obstacles,
flew half-way around the world* before the gaze of an amazed and admiring world.


HERE’S JOHNNIE!
Amy: “Going Sydney way? Hop in.” By Johnny Morgan, “The Sun.”


Song
of the
Flapper
—Ace
HERE’S a wild time droned by a hot exhaust
As a throttle’s opened, wide,
|>L~‘Jss| And a bacchanal screamed hy a hurry hladc,
High up where the white clouds ride.
Cleaving the winds through vasty space
O’er jungle, swamp, and glade,
Comes the Flapper-Ace, with a grease-grimed face,
Down the Pioneers’ Parade.
Out—and away where the ranges loom
And the screaming monsoons whirl
With shuddering hreath, —on the Wings of Death
Rides a lone and dauntless girl.
What though storm-kings swoop and tear, —
What though the grim Fates jest, —
There’s a vanity-case and a mirror there,
And Grit in a Feminine Breast.
And her bright blade bites at the battling winds
And spins with a glittering sheen:
And eager valves —with a rhythmic step —
Dance for their new air Queen.
The mocking scorn of the mere man’s pride
Is drowned in the exhaust’s roar
As she zooms and hanks where the high winds ride
And steers for the Austral shore.
High—where the mists and the rains are horn —
Low —with a shuddering drone:
With her engine throhhing a mad refrain
To the Khahyle wolf-dogs’ moan.
Onward —ever the Green ’plane zooms,
And ever the tappets dance
A mocking tread to the Hymns of Doom
And a prayer to the gods of Chance.
Singeing her wings at the Flames of Death —
Riding a Jason’s Quest —
Daring the Fates in a Gypsy Moth
At Adventure’s stern hehest.
Over the glohe from a Small Red Dot
To the Gates of the sun-drenched West.
Binding the twain with a firm Red Knot
Comes Grit, in a feminine hreast.

“THESE WIMMIN”
. “These wimmin,” said Bill to me, with
a slight trace of alcoholic anger, “are
getting insufferable since Amy Johnson
arrived. It’s time they were put in their
place.” Bill drained another measure—
being a He-man, he always drinks beer—
I and prepared to go. “I’m going right
back to sack my typiste,” he announced,
i,“I’ll show ’em!” Bill’s right! We’ve got
to do something about it. just
look at the uppishness of the
sports girls in the top right
|!corner, the contemptuous in-
dependence of the outdoor
girls left and right, and the
elegant insignificance
of the boy friends
below.—F.N.R.
Three reasons why sports girls have started flying round the world.


A Flapper Who Made the World Gasp!
IT STARTED UNOSTENTATIOUSLY.
was a casual kind of cable-
gram in the newspapers in January
saying that Amy Johnson, 22, had
gained the Air Ministry’s ground en-
gineer’s licence and was “cherishing”
an ambition to fly to Australia and beat
Bert Hinkler’s record.
Then we forgot all about her until
March, when we were told that she
was trying to get a British aircraft
firm to sponsor the flight.
On the morning of May 5, with a
parachute strapped on her back, a par-
cel of sandwiches, some chocolates,
and abundance of faith in herself,
“Johnnie” rose from the Croydon
Aerodrome. The great journey was
begun.
T'HE wind was following and the fog
was thick. She flew on. The com-
pass was all she could see. But on she
went.
Suddenly the fog lifted. There was a
small stream below. Had she turned and
come back on her course? She realised
with a thrill that she had actually crossed
the Channel and was flying over France.
Onward still, for Vienna was to be the
first landing.
She made her airport at half-past five
in the afternoon. The first stage was
over. Probably confidence was now
doubled. If one could fly safely to Vienna,
why not further?
Next morning she was early in the air.
The weather was fine. Later the Balkan
Mountains came in sight, and the rain-
storms were bad, but not enough to baulk
an intrepid nature like this. Constantin-
ople’s minarets eventually came in sight,
and the landing was accomplished.
The next flight was to Aleppo. Before
her were the great Taurus Mountains
barring the passage. What an outlook
for this girl, who had hitherto been doing
a little flying over the green fields of
England. They lay ahead clothed in mists
and dense clouds.
Anything might happen in a fog. There
is the danger of crashing against cliffs.
Visibility was nil. Undaunted, she kept
on, and at last the mountains were passed.
Europe was left behind! This English
girl was making history!
T'HE newspaper correspondents were
now sitting up and taking notice. A
small paragraph to say that she had ar-
rived had been the daily message. “She
arrived smiling,” said the cablegrams.
From Aleppo to Baghdad was a hazard
that might have caused her to reconsider.
The desert lay between.
She went on. The wind rose. A sand-
storm in the desert had to be faced. So
fierce was the gale that the staff at the
Imperial Airways at Baghdad gave up
hopes of seeing her that night, if at all.
The storm increased. The sand made fly-
ing impossible. The machine came down.
Here was a terrifying experience. She
was encouraged, no doubt, by the fact
that her machine was of the most re-
liable British make, but it sometimes
takes more than machinery to move a
stranded aeroplane. She could hear dogs
barking somewhere in the distance. Arabs
would be in the vicinity. She placed
whatever articles she could about the
wheels to chock them and keep the ’plane
from moving, and with a revolver in her
hand waited for two hours, crouched in
the lee of the machine.
The gale abated. She put the luggage
back in place, cranked up, and like a
bird soared once more. Ahead lay the
Tigris, which she found and followed.
Greatly surprised were the men of the
aerodrome staff at Baghdad to see her.
Friday, May 9, she headed for Bandar
Abbas. Down the Persian Gulf she was
flying into the heat, and from Bandar
Abbas to Karachi it was terrific, a heat
wave affecting the whole coast.
She was now well ahead. The record
for the flight to Australia was within her
grasp. Baghdad said she was the most
wonderful flyer of all, and they had seen
many such.
The newspaper reports extended. We
began to read detailed accounts of her
“hops.” Here she was at Karachi, on the
borders of another continent. This girl
was taking continents in a hop or two.
At Karachi they garlanded the won-
derful flyer with flowers. An escort was
provided for some distance on the way
to Allahabad.
She was two days ahead of the Hinkler
record when she arrived on the evening
of May 12.
Now came the worst stage of the jour-
ney. The full monsoon to be faced, and
weather conditions far from favourable.
All flying men regard it as the most
hazardous part.
Off again, heading for the Equator.
The course from India is down the coast
of Burma to Rangoon. The world was
waiting, breathless. She had a challenge
in her machine^
The machine was lightened to the ut-
most. Even a khaki shirt and a pair of
shorts had to be borrowed at every land-
ing.
May 13 she left India on a foggy morn-
ing.
Following the coastline, over the Irra-
waddy for Rangoon, following the rail-
way line till she came to Insein, nine miles
from Rangoon, at half-past five in the
evening.
A football ground of the Engineering
Institute looked like the Rangoon race-
course. It proved to be too small. She
continued. The machine was flying low;
it nearly touched the tree-tops. Losing
Rangoon in her search, she returned to
Insein and landed. While taxi-ing, the
’plane fell into a ditch. Propellor,
wheels, and wing damaged—the first mis-
hap.
Repairs to wings and wheels were made
by the engineerin' l- staff. The machine
had to be towed to Rangoon. Tests had
to be made. The delay was fatal. Hink-
ler’s record might be beaten by hours,
though it could not be by days.
Everything was right, and away again
for Bangkok.
She went off in the rain, heading for
Moulmein, to find a nass through the
mountains. Clouds and rain obscured
everything-. She could see no pass. She
rose to 9000 feet. Then, turning north,
she sought an opening. She turned to
the right, then to the left. The weather
cleared. She found herself still on the
Burma side of the mountains. Another
try, and out on the Siam side of the
country, but for three hours she was
unable to pick up her position.
Finally she picked up a railway line that
showed on the map. She knew her posi-
tion. The rest was easy. Bangkok at
5.45, and a tired girl pilot still smiled as
she got out of the ’plane.
On May 17 the ’plane left Bangkok for
Singora.
Here came the worst exoerience to that
time. She expected to cover the 1000
miles to Singapore in one day, but the
weather was against her. Head-winds
and rainstorms buffeted the machine.
Comp-elled to land at Singora.
On the 19th she covered the 460 miles
between Singora and Singapore in six
hours, flying low over the jungle, the
weather becoming hotter and hotter. A
sun-tanned, happy girl climbed out of the
aeroplane, enthusiastically greeted by the
crowd assembled to see this great event
in the history of Singapore.
Leaving Singapore on the morning of
the 19th for Sourabaya, she landed on
a sugar plantation in the middle of Java.
The journey was terrific. She flew
across stretches of dense jungle, and the
wind bumped the machine within a few
feet of the tree-tops. She was ready to
jump with her parachute at any moment.
Crossing the Java Sea, the monsoon com-
pelled her to fly just above the water.
She expected to crash into the water at
any moment. “I was terrified of the
sharks waiting for me to fall,” she said
of this experience. It was a great re-
lief to her when she saw the outline of
the Java coast. Following this she even-
tually reached Tjomal plantation.
Big bunches of flowers were waiting
for her when she landed at Samarang at
10 o’clock.
From Samarang she hopped to Soura-
baya, and arrived at 1.15 in the after-
noon.
The engine was tired. So was the
girl. Could she venture the flight across
the ocean to Darwin?
She set out at dawn to fly like a bird
across the sea, straight for her mark. A
steamer was on it ahead—right ahead.
Her course was dead true.
Weary and sunburned, but with her
unquenchable smile, “Johnnie” stepped on
to Australian soil at Darwin—and combed
her hair.

"The Dancer of the Air"
(By Will Lawson).
Who is it flashes through the sky
To make the nations stare,
Now flying low, now flying high
With skill and speed to spare f
The Tamil coolie-man replies,
“The Dancer of the Air."
As light as thistledown she goes
And gaily as a star,
Where wild and strong the monsoon
blows
And jungle terrors are.
Yet who can trip this dancer’s toes
And who her magic marf
The driving steamers, head to sea,
Have heard from out the clouds,
A faint high-heating melody,
Like winds in singing shrouds,
And seen her speeding high and free
To thrill a city's crowds.
The panther in the jungle dim,
The shark by sidlen shore,
Have crouched to see the Dancer skim
Beneath the thunder's roar,
Then rise above the tempest's rim
And dance away once more.
Who is it rides across the sea,
To Darwin’s ridges hare>
With all a woman's artistry,
And pluck and skill to spare
A nation's idol notv is she,
“The Dancer of the Air."

that the staunchness of Dunlop Aeroplane Tyres

that they arrived in Australia as good as new and

This book is a composite production,

Sydney press. It is published to enable
the City Sports Girls to assist the
Crippled Children and the Amy

sports girls it may be well to make it
clear that they are not responsible for
the editorial matter, which otherwise
might appear in parts unduly hilarious

appreciation is due to the various
business firms who have supported the
production with their advertisements
—although we feel sure that they will
get good value for their money.

Lord Wakefield—the Patron Saint of Aviation
There undoubtedly is no other citizen of the British Empire who has
done more to foster and encourage the interests of aviation than Lord
Wakefield, head of the well-known oil firm. Every flier who has undertaken
the long trek from England to Australia, and many elsewhere, have had the
solid practical support and kindly interest of this big-hearted English
gentleman. Because he is a man who would never countenance blatant
limelighting the full extent of his support to aviation is not known. When
Miss Johnson was making valiant efforts to arrange for her flight to Aus-
tralia, it was Lord Wakefield who came to her assistance, financing, amongst
other things, the considerable cost of laying down petrol supplies all along
the route. Through the Sydney branch of his firm he made arrangements
for the welfare of the gallant girl flier to be properly taken care of, and
this has and is being done thoroughly and unostentatiously. — Ed. “ Johnnie”
Book.
Lord Charles Wakefield.
Lord Wakefield, the founder and head
of C. G. Wakefield and Co. Ltd., manu-
facturers of the universally famous “Cas-
trol” Motor Oils, made it possible for
“Johnnie” to hop off. We thank him!
An outstanding man of industry, enter-
prise and philanthropy, he is a true
Brjton and places the British Empire and
its'progress before wealth and self.
Automotive Sport.
Prominent among the many interests
of Sir Charles Wakefield is the practical
supplrt extended by him to motoring and
aviation, dating from the pioneer days
when he was present at the arrival of
Bleriot, after his historic flight across the
English Channel, in 1909. On this oc-
casion, Sir Charles presented Bleriot with
a rare 17th century book on the subject
of aviation in a specially bound cover.
As is publicly known the memorable
flights of Sir Alan Cobham to Australia
and Africa were made possible by the
substantial support and moral backing of
Sir Charles Wakefield.
He also participated in financing the
remarkable achievement of Bert Hinkler
on his solo flight from England to Aus-
tralia in 15i days. To commemorate
Hinkler’s remarkable achievement Sir
Charles Wakefield presented a light aero-
plane to the Commonwealth Government
of Australia. This plane was loaned by
the : Commonwealth Government to the
N.S.W. Aero Club, which is recognised
aspime of the most progressive aero clubs
i|Fthe British Empire.
*Other planes presented by Sir Charles
Wakefield include light aeroplanes to
Lancashire Flying Club, Toronto Flying
Club, Dominion of New Zealand, Montreal
Flying Club, and a seaplane to the Singa-
pore Flying Club.
Sir Charles also financed the building
of the now world famous motor boat,
“Miss England,” which recovered the
world’s motor boat speed record for the
British Empire from America who had
held this coveted title for a number of
years. "Miss England” has now been
presented to the nation and is to be pre-
served in one of the English museums.
. .
He is the donor of the Sir Charles
Wakefield Gold Medal, an annual award
to the designer of any invention or ap-
paratus tending toward safety in flying.
The winner of this medal is decided by
the Royal Aeronautical Society and it was
presented in 1927 to M. L. Bramson, the
inventor of the slotted wing anti-stall de-
vice.
There, are hundreds of other instances
of his philanthropy and support and it
is hardly to be wondered at that those
who have experienced the pleasure of
meeting him regard Sir Charles Wake-
field as a kindly, generous man with an
exceptionally broad vision.
On the Wings of the Wind
Dicing with death on every stage of her air-journey across the world, the girl flier
soared triumphant over the lurking perils, to a brilliant and stirring climax.

Amy: “Dash! There goes my powder puff.” By
J. Cometti, aged 14, of the “Sun” Art Department.
ability to thoroughly survey any circum-
stances which might arise on such a trip,
then to make a wise decision.
Prior to Miss Johnson’s unfortunate
accident, near Rangoon, it seemed almost
certain that she w T ould be able to break
the solo flying record from England to
Australia, now held by Bert Hinkler, and
the fact that this accident delayed her
sufficiently to stop her breaking the re-
cord, in no way detracts from the extra-
ordinarily good performance she has put
up.
In normal circumstances, and, if I may
say it, with a normal pilot in charge of
the aircraft, I would not be at all happy
for a continuation of a flight in a light
single-engined machine from Rangoon to
Australia, but Miss Johnson’s display of
perseverance on the flight from England
to Rangoon was such as to imbue myself
and all other airmen in Australia with
the utmost confidence in her ability to
safely reach her goal, and it was with a
feeling of great joy that we learned that
she was able to repair the machine and
continue the flight which has ended so
successfully.
No words of mine can adequately ex-
press my unbounded admiration of Miss
Amy Johnson’s epic Solo Flight from
England to Australia.
Apart from this wonderful demonstra-
tion of a young woman’s ability, pluck and
perseverance, it has an even greater value
to aviation, and this is that a flight such
as the one she has just completed success-
fully must be of tremendous publicity
value to the industry as a whole through-
out the world, and any honour or credit
that may be bestowed on Miss Johnson
has been well earned.

Don’t forget it was the generous support of
Lord Wakefield that made possible Miss
Johnson’s flight to Australia. Lord Wake-

supplies of petrol as well as supplying oil.

Mascot Arrangements
An exclusive and hitherto unpublished radiogram photo-
graph, received by wireless telephone from London,
without the assistance of Amalgamated Wireless Beam
Service, showing Johnnie with her flying instructor, who
is pointing the direction in which Australia is believed
to lie.
IN order that the crowds at Mascot Aero-
* drome shall be kept pleasantly
occupied while awaiting Miss Amy John-
son’s arrival, ideal arrangements have
been made by the authorities and Philips’
Radio, who are working in conjunction
with Fox Movietone and Shell Petrol.
“Big Bill,” the 500 watt Philips’ Mobile
Public Address Amplifier, who has been
more than once truthfully referred to as
the “Big Noise of Sydney” will be in-
stalled on the field near the Aero Club’s
hangars in order that the crowd shall be
kept fully conversant with all that is go-
ing on.
All official announcements will be made
through the gigantic Philips’ talkie speak-
ers on “Big Bill,” while detailed descrip-
tion of the arrival of Miss Johnson’s
plane will be broadcast from a Fox-
Movietone plane which will fly 100 miles
into the blue to meet her.
Broadcasting from this plane is ex-
pected to commence about an hour be-
fore the planes are sighted over Mascot.
While waiting to pick the messages up
with a radio player, “Big Bill” will render
favourite phonograph records, and also
a brief commentary on the lady flyer’s
wonderful achievement.
A microphone installed near the spot
where her plane will land, will be used
to describe for the crow 7 d the actual land-
ing. Names of the escorting planes, to-
gether with their pilots and identification
marks will be given, in order that every-
thing can be easily followed.
When the landing has been effected,
Miss Johnson will take her seat in a motor
car and be driven right round the aero-
drome in order that all shall obtain a
glimpse of her. Her plane will also be
taxied around the aerodrome.
Returning to the front of the Aero
Club pavilion, Miss Johnson will speak
into a Philip’s microphone connected to
“Big Bill” and give the crowd her im-
pression of her flight and reception. Our
new Governor, Sir Philip Game, and the
Premier, Mr. Bavin, will also be invited
to make use of the microphone, together
with other officials taking part in the
reception.
Spectators are particularly requested
not to climb over the barriers, and to as-
sist the police as much as possible. Every-
body will have an opportunity of seeing
and hearing Miss Johnson if they keep
their places in . the crow r d.
Remember, these arrangements have
been made for your benefit, and they can
only work smoothly with your co-opera-
tion.
A few notes on “Big Bill” will, un-
doubtedly, be of interest. This wonder-
ful machine, which has cost several
thousand pounds to build, is equipped with
a double table phonograph, an all-wave
Philip’s radioplayer, and several micro-
phones, so that he can broadcast not Only
wireless messages, but music and speech.
He is happy anywhere, on the aerodrome,
at a political meeting, on a racecourse,
on a beach, in fact everywhere a crowd
needs entertain-ing. He is, of course, not
a permanent installation, and where fre-
quent entertainment is required, many
authorities are establishing equipment
similar to his as a fixture.

Helping a Good Cause
SIR HENRY BRADDON’S MESSAGE.
WEALTH of welcome and congratulations
will be accorded by Sydney to Miss Amy
Johnson, and the Town Hall reception will leave
unquenchable memories. I think she will be glad
to know that her intrepid and wonderful accom-
plishment has helped very materially the cause
of the crippled children of Sydney.
On their behalf, and on behalf of the society
devoted to their care, I tender her our very grate-
ful thanks and good wishes.

City, 23/5/’3O.
President.


Greetings to Amy
from
Metro- goldwyn -Mayer
RADIO-MOVIE-CLUB
“Johnnie, You're a Bird”
UROM our 50,000 members all over Aus-
tralia rises a Paean of PRAISE for
the wonderful flight of Miss Johnson.
From our three Radio Stations, 2GB
Sydney, 2HD Newcastle, and 3DB Mel-
bourne, reports of her progress have been
sent out daily—from these our members
will hear of her safe arrival and welcome
at Mascot.
Miss Johnson, in her plane, “Jason’s
Quest,” is a romantic figure. Jason set
out in olden times to find the Golden
Fleece. He had not heard of Australia.
Had he lived in these times he would
have known that the land of the Golden
Fleece was AUSTRALIA. Miss Johnson
is the modern Jason, winging her way to
the land of the Golden Fleece—the land
of Gold, Golden Wattle, Golden Hearts,
and Golden Welcomes.
Her welcome from the Club is to be truly
“Golden.” She has been unanimously
elected a Life Member and will receive
the Gold Badge of membership. The pro-
ceeds of the Club’s “808 IN FOR AMY”
Fund will be handed to her in gold. How
big is the purse to be? Well, we will see.
It will certainly be big enough to hoM all
the sovereigns we get into the Fund. Have
you sent in YOUR “bob” yet? If not,
send it along and show your appreciation
of the plucky exploit of this gallant York-
shire lass. There was never a true Aus-
tralian yet who would not back his or her
opinion with their money. Your opinion
of Amy is worth backing, so send in your
money. Put your contribution into an
envelope, mark it “A.J.” and address it to
the Manager Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer
Radio Movie Club, care of Box 2576 E.
G.P.0., Sydney. Your donation will bo
acknowledged in the daily press.
Why Members Are Interested.
One of the objects of the Club is to en-
courage Aviation, and to endeavour to
build up “Airmindedness” amongst the
Australian public. Already there is a grow-
ing list of members for our proposed
AVIATION SECTION which will include
branches for Gliders and Model Aero-
planes. We hope that Miss Amy Johnson
will consent to be our Patroness, and we
will be extremely fortunate if she con-
sents.
One of the first organisations in Aus-
tralia to institute a welcome for Amy
Johnson, the Club early decided that its
welcome should not be an empty one. The
Club, thanks to the “Bob in fo: Amy”
Fund will greet her with full hearts and
full hands. In conjunction with Metro-
Goldwyn-Mayer Ltd., the Club intends to
present Miss Johnson with a copy of the
film depicting her landing and welcome at
Mascot. This will be a memento for all
times, as Miss Johnson will be able to
have the film screened upon her arrival
at home.
The Club’s programme is as follows:
Day of Arrival. Mr. R. M. J. Tweed
will officially welcome Miss Johnson on
behalf of the Club. Metro-Goldwyn-
Mayer Ltd. will make a film of the wel-
come, and the proceedings will be broad-
cast by Station 2GB.
Miss Johnson has been invited to speak
from Station 2GB to members of the Club
from 6.55 p.m. to 7 p.m. on the day after
her arrival. This talk will be relayed to
2HD Newcastle and 3DB Melbourne for
broadcasting.
On the Saturday after arrival we hope
Miss Johnson will meet members of the
Club at Mark Foys’ Theatre at 10 a.m. to
receive the golden badge of membership
and the proceeds of the “808 IN FOR
AMY” Fund.
Realising as we do the many calls that
will be made on Miss Johnson’s time we
shall only request her to stay at Foys’ for
about half an hour so that she may see
the film of her landing.
Leo the Star—and how he roars for Amy.
Members of the Club are singing to the
tune of “Gilbert the Filbert,” the follow-
ing:—
“Oh! Miss Amy Johnson, you’re right on
the job,
To read your adventures gives us quite
a throb,
How thrilling the story, ’twill never be
dull,
For it’s HATS OFF TO AMY, the Lassie
from Hull.

Tribute to Great Air Woman
(By A. Jackson in the “Sunday Guardian.”)
does it feel like to be the most conspicuous woman in
history? Ask Amy Johnson —gallant “Flying Johnnie” —
the wonder of whose deeds shall be sung by generations yet to
come.
For what woman in the storied past can compare with this
dauntless lass of our own nineteen-thirty?
“The blind old bard of Scio’s rocky isle” tells in the immor-
tal Iliad the story of Flelen of Troy, whose “face launched a
thousand ships.”
Poets and historians of our day have a stranger tale to tell
of a slip of a girl whose courage launched but one ship—but
never before was there so gallant a little barque, :.ior one freighted
with so precious a cargo!
For the “Jason’s Quest,” with the girl pilot at the helm,
carries the highest hopes and dearest wishes of a whole world of
women for this most daring of her sex —Amy, whose name,
meaning ‘‘the well beloved,” was surely in-
spired by the good-luck fairies at her christen-
ing!
And as the world of women has waited in
gratitude for the new trail she has blazed across
the sky for ner sex, the world of men has put
forth the right hand of comradely greeting to
the new star in the heavens, the new woman
who is of the goodly company of flying aces.

lone flight across the stormy seas

Bringing Home the Golden Fleece
From “Smith’s Weekly.”
By perilous seas with danger fraught,
Her flying footsteps hasten —
A sort of lipstick Argonaut,
A kind of female Jason.
No more the nation cares a rap
For glories a la Swanson;
Give us a flapper who can flap
Her wings like Amy Johnson!

like an arrow sped by some Titan hand, comes to
Australia—Miss Amy Johnson. No other flight has
so gripped the imagination, for no other flight since the
first attempt of Icarus has been so audacious. Truly it
may be said that the famous Flying Corps motto: —
“Ad astra per ardua” —“To the Stars through diffi-
