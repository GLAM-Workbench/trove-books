FOREWORD
T is no exaggeration, but the most sober truth, to say that but for the
women of Britain and their work, Germany would by now have won the
war. For had they failed to rise to the unprecedented demands which
their country has made upon them, Britain’s industrial effort would have
collapsed, and her armies in the field would have been paralyzed. Some three
million men have been withdrawn from British industry to serve with the colours ;
25 per cent, of the male labour employed in the chemical and engineering trades
has been drafted into the army ; the normal staffs of offices, factories, railways and
munition shops have been stripped to the bone at the imperious call of war. Had
the women of Britain been unable or unwilling to step into the vacant places, the
war, first lost in the workshop, would have been finally lost in the field.
But the women of Britain have not failed. Rather, they have taken up
their unlooked-for task with an energy, an enthusiasm and an efficiency which have
been one of the miracles of history. To-day there are some 900,000 British
women engaged in war industries, and of these more than 600,000 are directly
employed on the manufacture of munitions,
in chemical and engineering works, they are
Eighteen months ago two-thirds of the 500
In shipyards and in iron foundries,
ceaselessly working by day and night,
processes in the making of munitions
on which they are now engaged had never been performed by a woman. The
women of Brita n are putting over the barrage, without which their sons, their
husbands and their brothers could never hope to shatter the German lines.
But it is not in munition work alone that the face of British industry has
been transformed by the extension of women labour. As post-women and police,
as bakers and farm workers, as motor drivers and ’bus conductors —in almost every
occupation of which the mind can think—British women are now cheerfully
“ carrying on ” while their men-folk are away. In her hour of greatest need
Britain has called to her daughters. She has not called in vain. By their industry,
their efforts and their heroic sacrifice, the women of Britain have saved their country
and saved the world.
