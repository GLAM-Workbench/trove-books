CENTENARY OF RUGBY FOOTBALL
1524 1924
First Rugby League Annual, incorporating the official Souvenir programme of the British Northern
Rugby League Football Team’s visit on the occasion of the Centenary Anniversary of Brisbane as the
Capital City of Queensland.
•
SPECIALLY COMPILED AND ARRANGED
BY MICHAEL J. FIJI ELLY
for the
QUEENSLAND RUGBY FOOTBALL LEAGUE.
FOREWORD.
i”fiN preparing this souvenir for the supporters of Rugby Football in Queensland, an attempt has
1......1 teen made to give the genesis of the game, and to trace its growth and development, irrespec-
tive of code or control. With this object in view, the history of the Rugby Union game (now extinct
in Queensland) has been traced, and interesting pictures of the early British teams have been included,
tints completing every link in the chain of visiting teams from England, where Rugby Football was
first established. The birth of the game in Queensland, our victory over England in 1899, the change
of control, and the development of our football to the highest point in the annals of the game are fit
subjects for review on the occasion of a centenary, and particularly when the occasion synchronises
with the centenary of Brisbane, as the capital city of Queensland.
In the compilation of this budget I am in lebted to the following for assistance by way of
photographs and historical matter: —Messrs. Maurice Baldwin (ex-Secretary Queensland Rugby Union) ;
P. C. Lea (the “Old Bird,’’ one of the founders of the Union game in Queensland), .1. Davis (Editor
of the “Referee,” Sydney) ;R. D. Miller (Secretary, New South Wales Rugby League); J. O’Connor
(one of the founders of the League game in Queensland) ; Redmond Byrne (ex-Secretary, Queensland
Rugby Union) ; C. Woodhead, J. Roche, Clifford Noble, W. Kuder, and W. S. Stock and 11. T. A. Wet-

Eugby football was a century old last year in Eng-
land, and as our football season follows the English season,
it is the centenary year of the game this year. Away back
in 1823 football was true to its name—a ball being played
with the feet only.. It was not handled. Then an impul-
sive lad named AVilliam AVobb Ellis, a student at the Eugby
school, England, picked up the ball and ran with it, the
rest of the players chasing him for possession. The novelty
of the idea at once made an appeal, and a conference ot
the students at Eugby was called, and rides and laws of
the game were drawn up. And this class of football became
known as Eugby football, after the name of the place
where the idea of running with the ball as well as kick-
ing and tackling for possession originated.
At the Eugby school the performance of AVilliam AVebb
Ellis is commemorated by a granite slab placed upon the
vail. The photographic production seen on page 23 is
explanatory. It is interesting to know that when Ellis gave
the big idea to the world of sportsmen—-an idea which
brought about a game that has since delighted millions
of people in England, AValea, Scotland, Ireland, France,
South Africa, New Zealand, Australia, and America, he
was but sixteen years of age. He lived till 1872, not long
enough to see the first British team under the captaincy
of A. E. Stoddart, visit Australia; but long enough to
know that the game of Eugby had captured the imagin-
ation of the English speaking races by its robust appeal
to the best instincts of the race—courage, grit, speed, pow-
ers of endurance, enterprise, intelligence, imagination, and
the spirit of conquest. AVhen played by experts, Eugby
is the most skilful, most spectacular, and most thrilling of
all games for athletes, and under the revised rules, as
framed by the Northern Union founded in 1895, and
amended from time to time since, i( has reached a stage
of perfection not anticipated in the imagination of young
M.J.F
Ellis.

The Northern Union Game
Its Origin and Development in England.
Up till the year 1895, Rugby, under a uniform
code of rules, was played in England. In that year
a breakaway movement took place, which revolu-
tionised the game in the Midland counties. It ought
to be explained that the population of the Midlands
consists mainly of miners, textile trade workers, and
people who have little time and money to spare
to indulge in the pleasures and pastimes of gentle-
men. in 1895 the footballers of Lancashire, York-
shire, and Cumberland made application to the Eng-
lish Rugby Union for the payment of broken time
for matches played while away from work. These
footballers had to travel long distances at consider-
able expense, and they explained that they could
not play football and work conjunctively unless rea-
sonable travelling expenses were allowed. The Eng-
lish Rugby Union refused the request, the reason
being given that to grant the proposals would be to
violate the amateur status, which, with the English
Rugby Union, is like the laws of the Persians and
the Medes.
Being a football-loving community, the Nor-
thern counties formed themselves into a union, and
decided to continue to play Rugby, and they drew
to their ranks numerous clubs in the cotton and coal
districts. An effort was made to extend the move-
ment further to the South of England, and into
Wales, but owing to a hostility to anti-amateurism,
amounting almost to fanaticism, it was not a suc-
cess. The best that the organisers of the new move-
ment could do was to attract the best players from
the rest of England and Wales to the Northern
Union Clubs, which soon flourished by the big gate
takings that the attractiveness of the new game
afterwards brought.
For some years after the breakaway movement
the old rules were observed, but it was. realised that
some room was still left for experiment. It was con-
sidered that thirty players on the field made for
congestion and slowness, and the experiment with
twenty-six was tried, with good results. The game
was so sharpened up by lack of obstruction, that the
experiments were continued. The line-outs were
eliminated and scrums substituted, while a rule was
made that a .player falling on the ball should be al-
lowed to rise and play it, and not allowed to remain
on the ground, and be : booted till he was disfigured
or maimed. In making these amendments, the Nor-
thern Union got nearer to the best conceptions of
Rugby football as originated by young Ellis when
he took the ball and ran. To run with the ball, to
pass it and to keep it in play and as much off the
ground and inside the playing area as possible, were
features calculated to produce speed, quick thinking
and spectacular thrills with the chance of the unex-
pected always happening. And this is how it has
all worked out. The Northern Union game has cap-
tured the imagination of the people in the countries
of its origination in such a way that no other game
can now supplant it, and in Queensland and New
South Wales it holds all the records in attendances
and gate takings. Sydney holds the world’s record
in attendance for football under Rugby rules—either
League or Union.
Pioneer Personalities.
Prominent personalities in the work of the revi-
sion of the rules in the Northern counties of England
were Mr. J. H. Smith of Widnes, and Mr. Joseph
Platt, of Oldham. Their work was continued by Mr.
Smith, J. Cooke of Wakefield, and Mr. E. Osborne of
Warrington. The Northern Rugby League of Eng-
land is so democratic that each year the Council
meets and proposed alterations for the improvement
of the game are experimented with, and abandoned
with if unsuitable and added to the rules if service-
able and attractive. Thus, since the first visit of the
Northern Union team in 1910, the scrummages are
packed differently and the ball is now rolled in where
it was once bounced in shoulder high.
Impressions of the 1910 foeam.
This pioneer British contingent came to Australia when this country was strange to the finer points of the
League game. They were a very formidable lot, and easily accounted for Queensland, then only in swaddling
clothes, and unable to furnish the best in her footballers through the competition with the Union game. There
were some fine outstanding players in this side, the most notable of the bunch being, perhaps, Johnny Thomas,
the Welsh five-eighth, with James Lomas, the stockily-built centre three-quarter as a striking personality. T. Shar-
rock, a full back as heavy as a house, gave new conceptions of the requirement's of the position with the grubber
swallow skimming kick for the side lines, and J. Leytham was a great try-getting winger.

The Genesis of Rugby in Queensland.
The origin of Rugby football in Queensland, dates back to the days when the delicate fragrance
o) gum leaves could still be caught on the breeze in Queen Street and when an occasional aboriginal
camp could be found in the suburban hills. In the year 1882, forty-two years ago, what was afterwards
to be the Queensland Rugby Union—then named the Northern Rugby Union—was formed by a band of
enthusiasts, at the head of whom were Messrs. P. C. Lea (now of the Commonwealth Bank), Arthur
Peez (now K.C. and leader of the bar in Queensland and afterwards a Q’land representative player),
Prank Bellbridge, Thomas Welsby (afterwards anM.L.A.), Prank Baynes (now of the Titles’ Office),
11. Mackintosh (recently of the Survey Department), G. B. Markwell (now a solicitor in Cairns), and a
number of others, all good fellows, most of whom have crossed the last line.
Most of the founders of the Rugby Union game came from the ranks of the clubs which then
played under Victorian Rules (now better known as Australian Rules). The first two clubs formed
under the fifteen-aside control were the “Fireflies,” and the “Wanderers.” The first intercolonial game
was played in 1882 at Sydney against the Southernßugby Union (as New South Wales was then known).
Tlie second game between the two States was played at the Bagle Farm racecourse in the following year.
The game became immensely popular from its inception and soon outstrode the Victorian Code in public
favour. Clubs sprang up all over the city and in the country, and in ten years the roots of the Rugby
game, which to-day are so firmly set in the soil of Queensland sport, were deeply embedded. Of the
early clubs from which famous footballers were produced were the Arfomas, Ipswich Rangers, Past
Grammars, Boomerangs, Citys, Rosevales, Wallaroos, the North Brisbane electorate club and Christian
Brothers from 1907.

The early secretaries were Thos. DVelsby,,. Geo. E. Mark well, Fred C. Lea, 0. J. Wilkins, the
late W. H. Beattie (who was also a Queensland representative player, referee and one of the first movers
in the League game in 1908), the late 11. J. Godsall, (brother of the Mayor of Toowoomba), Maurice
Baldwin (now Secretary of the Q.T.C.), and later Redmond Byrne (now of the State Insurance), Dave
Carter, and Joe Grogan.
All these gentlemen gave much to the game, particularly Dir. F. C. Lea and Dir. Dlaurice Baldwin, and
E. J. Beard, whose only thought for years was that the game might boom and prosper. Had it not been
for their early enthusiasm thex-e might not have been a solid Rugby foundation in the Rugby loving State
of Queensland. The Rugby Union went out of existence in the middle of the 1918 season, a circumstance
hastened by the war when all active opei’ations were suspended. When the time arrived to resume, it
was found that there was no room for two games in the inetropolis and the Union gracefully gave way
and bowed to the inevitable. There was no display of bitter feeding over the League victory. It was
simply a competition for public support and the League got the vex-dict through having a more attractive
and up-to-date game. The Rugby Union game reigned for nearly Jfi years and established some imperish-
able traditions and gave to Rugby some of the brightest stars, whoso memory will survive -all generations
of Rugby footballers. .No review of football would he complete without the mention of these traditions
and some reference to the great players of the past, and that is why such matter is incorporated in these

pages.

The Origin of the League Game in Australia
A Romance and Adventure in Rugby Football.
The Northern counties of England had been playing
separate football outside the affiliation of the English
Eugby Union for twenty-two years, when it was left to the
enterprise of enthusiasts under the Southern Cross to start
another ball rolling here. After the tour of the famous
New Zealand “All Blacks,’’ through Groat Britain in
1905-6, whose football wizardry brought fortunes in gate
takings to the English Eugby Union, the late iMr. E. E.
Baskerville, of Hew Zealand, organised a team of New
Zealanders in the following year—l9o(3, in which were
included a number of prominent members of the original
All Blacks. —G. Tyler, Smith, C. Selling, Nicholson ‘Massa’
Johnson and George Gillett. They had secured some fine
footballers besides, and when they came to Sydney they
commenced negotiations with H. H. Messenger, then a mag-
nician on the Eugby football field. Messenger’s name was
such magic in 1907 that all records in attendances were
broken in that year. For the first time in the history of
the game, New South Wales were able to administer de-
feat to New Zealand, at Eugby Union. This was the year
following the all-conquering tour of the famour “All
Blacks,” and when New South Wales (with the genius
of Messenger) could eclipse a team composed of a ma-
jority of the original “All Blacks,” the whole footballing
world stood up and took notice. The late Mr. E. E.
Baskerville with shrewd foresight, took practical notice,
and made an offer to Messenger to go with a team of Pro-
fessional “All Blacks” to England. Messenger accepted,
lie was the big draw card of the League game in those
days. Messenger meant the public, and the public meant
everything as was afterwards to be shown.
AFTEE THE “ALL BLACKS” TOUE.
The second episode was the tour of tho Baskerville’*
All Blacks through England. While all-round tho side was
not as electric as the Eugby Union team of 1905-6, the
marvellous football of Messenger, who was then at the

REMARKS ON STODDART’S TEAM.
This team was very versatile and played the Austra-
lian game as well as Rugby, touring Victoria for this
purpose. They were better at Rugby, however. They did
not play an Australian side. A try in those days counted
only one point, a goal from a try 2 and a field goal 3.
They scored seven tries in the first match against Queens-
land. They were masters at the handling game, their

feint passing being a revelation in those days. They came
out under the captaincy of R. J. Seddon, a brilliant player
who was drowned at Maitland (N.S. Wales). The great
players on this side were A. E. Stoddart, who was also;
n international cricketer, who played wing three-quarter,
and H. C. Speakman, the half-back, who afterwards played
for Queensland. They left much to Australian Rugby. Note
the limited use of the razor in these days.

rmtSONA LJTJES.
This famous team defeated
the Mullineux’s British side
by II to 3.
The winning points in this
memorable game, which was
played at the Exhibition
Grounds twenty-five years
ago, were scored by W. T.
(“Poley”) Evans, a fine
wicket-keeper and big hitter
in Queensland Cricket Teams
in later years, A. Corfe two
tries, and the late Austin
Gralton, a goal from a try.
They were a powerful all-
round side—fast, tricky, and
devilish tacklers. R. Mc-
Gowan was the best full-
back of his day, and it is
said that there has been no
superior to him since. He is
a solicitor practising in Bris-
bane to-day. W. H. Austin,
who ranks among the best
forwards Rugby has produced,
having represented Queens-
land in over twenty represen-
tative matches, now repre-
sents Queensland as the chief
of the State Trade Office.

RECOLLECTIONS OF THE 1904 TEAM.
This team is easily the best remembered of the Union fifteen aside exponents from Great Britain. They
came from England, Ireland, Wales and Scotland and were a magnificent combination, the forwards being all utility
men trained in every department of the game. They packed indiscriminately, the first men up being the hookers.
They were great dribblers and formidable ruck workers. The backs were world’s champions in their day, Llewellyn
and Morgan and Gabo being fast and perfect wingers and Vile, llulme and Percy Bush extraordinary half backs.
They introduced the cross-kick with perfect manipulation and bewildered our players by running at top speed for
the wings and then booting to centre field, where the forwards pounced on it greedily. The great drop kicking
from the flve-eigth position by Percy Bush from impossible angles was also a feature of the tour. They did not lose
a game in Australia, and > won all the test matches, the first by 17 to nil, the second by 17 to 3 and the third by
16 to nil. Their closest game was against a Queensland Western Districts Team in Toowoomba, which they won
by 12 to 3. When they went to New Zealand looking the most invincible combination that had been seen in
Australia up to that time, they were whipped in the majority of their games, a flattering testimony to the high
standard of New Zealand football at that period.

THE MAN

Yallelv’s
Australian
Hotel
pinnacle of Us form m a try getter and a goal kicker,
was responsible for phenomenal gates. This pioneer tour
of Baskerville’s team was the seed that was eventually to
sprout into the tree so heavily laden with the fruit of
success. When the contingent returned from England,
their success was an encouragement to go ahead with the
game in Sydney and Brisbane, and when conditions at
that time were ripe for a change in control, the new
game quickly caught on, and its popularity was like fire
in withered undergrowth. Messenger, of course, brought
success much quicker than it might have come, and from
that time the game has never looked back. ,
It was while the late E. B. Baskerville’s team was in
Sydney after its tour of the Northern Union Counties,
that the first step was taken towards establishing the game
strongly in the Rugby centres of Sydney and Brisbane.
The Sydney stronghold had already been taken, but it had
to be held, and the way it had to be held was by secur-
ing the best players by offers of trips or spot cash, and
to keep the edifice together with more than the cobweb
connections of a one city following. The game
would have to be given an interstate and an international
connection. With this policy in view the team organised
by the late E. R. Baskerville found the soil suntable for
sowing and reaping the seed of the new Northern Union
code in Queensland. As Messrs. J. J. Giltinan, Joynton Smith
(now owner of “Smith’s Weekly”) and “Fred” Flow-
ers (now M.L.C. in N.S. Wales) had been the big men be-
hind the formation of the New South Wales Rugby League,
S. B. Boland, the late M. J. Dore, A. Faulkner, George
Watson, “Buck” Buchanan, and J. A. Fihelly were the
prime movers in the League game in Queensland. They
performed the spade work, and were able to assure the
“All Blacks” that if they came to Brisbane they would
be sure of a warm reception if they brought H. H. Mes-
senger with them. The further assurance that a strong
Queensland team composed of interstate players, and
young country stars, omitted from the Rugby Union team,
would be fielded, settled any further indecision, and the
“All Blacks” under the management of the late Mr. E.
R. Baskerville, came to Brisbane, and played the first game
early in the 1908 season.
TEE FIRST LEAGUE TEAM.
Three games were played against Queonslaml, the
“All Blacks” winning the first by 36 to 18, and the second
by 42 to 19, the third being drawn—l 2 all. In the first and
second matches the New Zealanders had the assistance of
Messenger, whose football was so brilliant that the scor-
ing was lopsided. Tet the football was sufficient to con-
vince the large crowds present of the delightful openness
and variety of the new code. When Messenger played for
Queensland in the final game, his greatness was so pro-
nounced that Queensland emerged from one of the most
dazzling exhibitions seen up to that time on the Exhibi-
tion Grounds. From that time the new game never look-
ed back. It would be interesting in passing to observe
that the members of the first Queensland representative
team under Rugby League rules was as follows:
Full backs, E. Beard and the late Phil Dwyer; three-
quarters: A. (“The Widow”) O’Brien, W. Evans, H. H.
Messenger, and George Watson and W. Heidke; half-backs:
the late M. J. Dore and W. Abrahams; forwards: R. Tub-
man, E. Cartmill, R. Allingham, Y. Anderson, J. A. Fihelly,
A. Moxby, W. Hardcastle.
The same year, 1908, the Queensland Rugby Associa-
tion (as the first League Executive was christened!, were
able to field fine teams against a full-blooded Maori team,
these games re-introducing Albert Asher, the famous
resilient wing three-quarter who had visited Australia with
the Duncan’s “All Blacks” of 1903. The tussles between
the Maoris and Queensland cemented the good impression
formed of the game by the first New Zealanders, and
brought more reinforcements of promising players and
public patronage. A. E. Anlezark, W. Heidke, and W.
COMMEMORATION STONE.
This atone at Rugby, England, establishes the genesis
of the Rugby game.
Hardcastle played for Queensland in these games, and all
were selected as members of the first Kangaroo team to
visit England at the end of the 1908 season, with J. A.
Fihelly as asst, manager. By an unfortunate stroke of
luck, Mr. E. R. Baskerville, whose enterprise really gave
the modern code of Rugby to Australia, died while in
Brisbane with his pioneer League team.
REASON FOB THE FORMATION.
In organising the League game in Australia the foun-
ders had three objects in view (1) to improve the game;
(2) to improve the conditions of the players by way of

The Visitors in Silhouette.
(BY MICHAEL J. EIHIELLY).
THE FULL BACKS.
J. SULLIVAN, the full back, is a native of Cardiff,
where they breed footballers and assorted politicians. He
would not have a vote in Queensland. Onlj- twenty.
He is the world’s record goal-kicker (172 goals in
one season). What’ he will no when he reaches his
“prime’’ staggers the imagination.
E. KNAPMAN, the second full back is an ex-soccer
exponent. His defence is like that of a divorce co-respon-
dent.
THE THREE-QUARTERS.
SYDNEY EIX is a big, heavy man. He is so good
that the selectors didn’t want to see him. The opposi-
tion will not be as satisfied as the selectors.
PRANK EVANS, the lightest person on the side —
10st. 71b. He is as slippery as an eel, or the winning
number of the Gulden Casket. Welsh Rugby Union inter-
national.
JOHNNY RING, another star winger, has a try-get-
ting record as long as the name of a Welsh railway sta-
tion. Nothing could be longer than that —except eternity.
WILLIAM BENTHAM, left winger, beat Applegarth
on the professional track. He is, therefore, faster than
a radio message.
C. W. CARR is one of the babies of the team. Only
21. He plays right centre. Is said to carry au electric
battery with him.
C. A. POLLARD, another “right centre,’’ is the util-
ity man of the side, He is as versatile as a renegade
politician.
J. A. BACON, was here with the 1921) team. Won the
Northern Union sprinting championship in 1922. He is
13 stone when stationary. AVhat his weight would be when
moving in full flight would cause the mathematicians to
collapse —and anybody else in the way.
T. HOWLEY, one of the Wigan cracks, left centre
three-quarter back. Heads the list of trygetters for his
club by sheer force of habit.
THE HALF-BACKS.
WALTER MOONEY, Is Parkin’s understudy as scrum
half. Has the reputation of being a great player in the
mud. Let us pray!—for a drought.
S. WHITTY, the stand off half. Is no relation to
Whitty the famous Australian bowler, but he bowls them
over just the same.
DANIEL HURCOMBE, stand off half, was here in
1920. Is a champion poker player. Plays football better
than poker.
THE FORWARDS.
JOHN BENNETT is one of the hookers. Weight,
13 st. 10 lb., before entering the dining-saloon. When
developing an appetite—for the ball his weight is—unbear-
able!
BEN GRONOW. lie is a “Big Ben’’ in every sense.
Cft., and 13 st. S lb. He boots goals each season, and the
reading is like Ponsford making a first wicket partnership.
Was here in 19-0, when he was the idol of the small boys.
A pretty compliment that.
W. CUNLIPPE also liked the return journey. Front
row artist. Played in all the tests of 1921-22. Excellent
ballast; 13st. 111 b.
FRANCIS THOMPSON. Nut. to be confused with the
pod of that name, but in dribbling is the poetry of mo-
tion. (Query: “emotion. I’’—Printer’s 1 ’’ —Printer’s Devil). Welsh in-
ternational. Only 21. lost. 3ibs., and still growing. Par-
ticulars of diet unavailable.
WILLIAM BURGESS, the tallest and heaviest man
in the team. Oft. 1 lb., and U st. But he is gentle as a
lamb OPP the football field.
JOHN PRICE. If his name hadn’t been John Price
it might have been John Bull. Unlike Einstein he does
nut believe that there is a curve in a straight line when he
gets the ball.
J. DAItWELL, another big man—fi ft. and 13 st. 9
lbs. The Greek Gods would have capitulated had they
seen him returning to scale.
ROBERT SLOMAN was done an injustice by his par-
ents. He is always in a hurry despite his name—and his
weight, which is 13 st. 0 lbs. Where he comes from—
Oldham —telegraph pules have been abolished for under-
ground wires. The gentleman is 0 feet high.
ALBERT BROUGH, au ex-Soccer player, and in
Rugby has passed the non-stop reliability test.
HAROLD BOWMAN, also an ex-Soccer convert. Ilia
bump is calculated to make Rugby players become converts
to Soccer.
DIA REES, Welsh international. Hails from Halifax.
Most immense things are told to go there —in a manner of
speaking.
PRANK GALLAGHER was out here with the 1920
team. An Irishman. And the better the fight the bettor
the Irishman. Wears green underclothing and is alleged to
train on Sinn Peiu literature, and the life of Do Valera.
The preparation is thorough.

compensating them for time lost at work through playing
football, and also compensation for accidents; (.1) to give
the public the brightest and cleanest Rugby that could be
played. By 1908 this had been accomplished, and in 1910
the game had so much progressed with public, support and
reinforcements from the rival control that the way was
paved for the bringing to Australia of the first Northern
Union team captained by Jas. Lomas. The inauguration
of international visits from and to England fired the in-
centive of the players, and the public realising that they
were being catered for, responded with added numbers year
after year. In Queensland good management ensured suc-
cess and progress, and thus we find that when the war
started in 1914 the new game was more than holding its
own with the opposition body. Great credit is due to the
League secretaries who helped to establish the League as a
sound business-like institution, such men as Mr. “Tim”
Donovan, who was the first League Secretary after the orig-
inal breakaway executive had handed over their work. Mr.
W. S. Hawkins, then Mr. Harry Sunderland, and now Mr. W.
Kuder. Mr. Sunderland was Secretary during the war,
when the Rugby Union abandoned business through lack
of sufficient players, scarcity of enclosed grounds, and gene-
ral lack of public support. Mr. Sunderland’s vigorous for-
ward policy hastened the extinction of the Union game in
1!)17, the residue of the players of the old body being
absorbed by the League, which now controls the Rugby
game in Queensland without opposition. It is interesting
to know that in no other country has there been such an
eclipse as this by the Rugby League. It is the highest tri-
bute to the popularity of the new code, and its efficient
management that, in the space of nine years after its in-
troduction, it should have scored so absolute a triumph. In
the last stages of the competition for public support and
the control of Rugby football, there was no ill-feeling dis-
played by either body, the officials of the Rugby Union
relinquishing their ground in the spirit of true sportsman-
ship, and the players going over as a matter of course, and
without the loss of their amateur status, so much feared
in the early stages of the tight for control. The League
game is now played from Cape York to Wallangarra, and
from Brisbane to the sunset lands.
