Way down under the sea, in the land of King Neptune,
a little mermaid called 'Pinkishell lived in a little house
made of coral. She did all her own housework also kept the
little garden pretty and free from seaweed, and was really
quite happy until one day she was paid a visit by an old
Mermothcr (that is what grown-up mermaids are called) and
during the afternoon?s conversation the old lady said ?Surely
you cannot be content with just living here day after day.


w/ ~* >
wouldn?t you like to see the
strange places above the sea??
Pinkishell said that ?she
really hadn?t thought of it,? so
the old lady spent most of the
afternoon telling her of strange
% people called mortals, who had
no tails but walked around
on legs and lived in houses
that were built on the
land that floated on top
of the sea?of the sun that
shone and green fields
After hearing all this, poor Pinkishell became very
unsettled and a few days afterwards she decided to pack her
few belongings and find these places for herself. In fact, as she
got out her little shell suitcase, she began to feel quite excited
and taking a last look around the little house locked it up and
set forth on her big adventure. She wasn?t quite sure which

way to go, but decided to just swim along until she met
someone who could tell her the way.
Hello! waved the Rockshell Twins, as they drove past in
their shell carriage drawn by two frisky little sea horses; and
Pinkishell wondered if she would gam enough our of
her journey to be like them, and fell to dreaming of great
wealth, only to be startled out of it by a deep voice saying
?What?s the matter Baby Pink? and there was Teddy
Dolphine spinning on his tail and winking.'
Now Pinky and Teddy had been playmates for ages, so
she told him eagerly of her plans. After listening and frisking
around in the water a while with a large grin, he said T know

Whale, who was as usual grunting
and blowing out large bubbles which
shot up very quickly. Suddenly,
Teddy darted out and with his fins
caught the biggest bubble in sight.
"Here, oh Queen, is your chariot?
said he, ?will your highness be so
good as to mount? ? and with a whisk of his tail helped
Pinkishell on to the bubble.
?Oh? she laughed ?isn?t this lovely? Thank you, Teddy.?
?Well, good luck? said he, and let her go, and up she went
waving to him as long as he was in sight. Up and up she
went it seemed forever; she thought, how tired I should
have been if I had had to swim. Suddenly, there was a terrific
bump and Pinkishell was knocked off her precious bubble
and caught on to something to steady herself. When she
had recovered from the shock she looked around to see
where she was and found it to be on a funny house floating


j'- *$$&


in the water. She swam all around it, opening doors and
boxes. One big box was full of pretty coloured pieces of rock
which were made into bracelets and necklaces which fitted
her neck and arms perfectly and was really enjoying trying
them on, when she was rudely interrupted by being
abruptly caught in some kind of tangled seaweed, and
whisked right up further and-?pop!?-clean out of the water.
?Oh!? she gasped at the shock and shaded her eyes -it was so
bright and warm - then she landed on something hard.
?Goo!? said a deep voice ?look
at those diamonds. When Pinkishell could see a bit
clearer, she looked up into two amazed, but pleasant,
faces and their bodies were finished with legs!!


??Hello! little stranger? said the other ?face? ?we seem to
have brought you out of your way. ?
It was such a kindly voice that Pmkishell felt at home
right away, so she
smiled and said
?Not at all, I think you are
just what I?m looking for.?
?And you, by the look of your jewels, could help us in
what we are looking for" said Bill. _???
So Pinkishell told them all that had happened, and of
her find on the way up much to her listeners? delight. They,

in return, told of their search for a lost ship of treasure, and
how poor they were. Joe had a little girl, just like Pinkishell
but she had legs that she couldn?t use and to cure her it
would take lots of money. Pinkishell felt very sorry. ?Well?
she said, ?if these stones will help you, let me down again
and I will fill your net
with the boxes.? They
didn?t need a second
invitation, so over she

dived holding on firmly to the big fishing net.
Down she went swimming this way and that until at
last she found the funny house again. She worked very hard
as the boxes were very heavy, but she managed to fill the
net to the top. Then up she went again and told Joe and
Bill to pull, and how they had to pull too, but at last they
got it up; and
at all its contents
glittered in the sun,
other with delight
on their legs, which

?Well, Miss Pinkishell? said Joe ?we would never have
succeeded without your help and you want to take a look
around the country. How about coming with us for a cruise?
When you have seen all you want to, we will bring you
right back and you can go home.
Pinkishell thought that a lovely idea, so they filled a

large tub of water for her, and she felt very much at home
in it. What happy days they spent, and what a fuss Joe and
Bill made of her.
Anyhow, one morning they reached land, "Now said
Joe, you are coming home with me to see my little
Nancy?she will love you.? Pinkishell felt very excited

into a big basket, which he carried on his back along
streets, into a house and up some stairs, and there she found
herself sitting by the side of a bed holding hands with the
prettiest little girl all wrapped up and lying on her back;
and how they talked to each other all about their lives
which were so different, and the little girl seemed so happy
in spite of not being able to move.
Then, one day they
took Nancy away, and
for many days Pinkishell
was lonely and everyone
seemed very anxious for
a while, until Joe came
home and said, ?Nancy
was cured.? ?In a few
weeks time she would
be walking about.?
How they all laughed

with joy when they heard the wonderful news
Finally, Pinkishell, decided she had stayed long enough
with these kind people and it was time to go home, but
before she went Joe presented her with a seaproof wireless
set, which he could afford easily now he was so rich, and
Nancy took her first walk down to the boat to see her off.
It was quite sad saying goodbye, but every Saturday Night
Nancy was going to speak to Pinkishell over the wireless and
tell her how she was getting on, so that made it better.
When she got home and told of
all she had seen and turned on her
wireless set, which no one had ever
seen or heard there before, she was
treated with the greatest respect as
the most experienced Mermaid in ,
Neptune land, and was a very
popular and happy Pinkishell
