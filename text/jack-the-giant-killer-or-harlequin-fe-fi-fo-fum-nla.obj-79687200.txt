JACK, THE GIANT KILLER
ACT X.
SCENE L?THE VILLAGE OF BREEZYBRIGHT, WITH DAME?S
COTTAGE AND FARMYARD.
Chorus of Villagers.
We?ye worked eight hours to-day,
And we?ve more than earned our pay.
Which, ?twixt me and you, is much overdue,
So we won?t work half a minute longer.
Dame
What?s this?all idle. Oh ! I 'd like to trounce ye;
As lazy good-for-nothings I denounce ye !
(Sings.)
There?s Tommy Huggins and Jemima Juggins,
I?ll swear you?ve both been spooning now instead of making hay ;
I?d like to batter ye? skulldrag and scatter ye
In Sullivan or Slavin?s persuading way.
But I?m only human?and n poor weak woman.
And my nerves they fail me, and my heart is out of trim
I?ve a touch of quinsy and the iufiuinzy.
And my sight?oh ! dear?is growing dim.
And I?ve worked eight hours to-day,
Though others I have to pay,
Who do as they like when they bear the clock strike.
For they won?t work half a minute longer.
Chorus.
Though she?s worked eight hours to-day,
Us others she has to pay ;
But we do as we like when we hear the clock strike.
For we won?t work half a minute longer.
Well, if you will not work you shall not loaf;
Be off, each lazy, lumping, loutish oaf!
[Chases them off.
I?ll sack you all; I will; mg lot ?twill soothe
To get afresh lot out through General Booth.
[Exit into cottage.
Dame


{Enter Ogre.)
Ogre Ha! {To orchestra) Just a trifle lower, if you please.
Ha! that?s much better ?several degrees.
My pasteboard now. Public you see in me
The very worst type of a D.D I)
Double dyed-desperado ?one who sticks
At nothing?but who all creation licks
For solid cussedness ?as plainly shown
By this one fact; ?twas I who queered the loan.
? Six millions,? wired Munro, ? be quick about it.?
? Pooh I ? said I, ? let the Scotchman go without it;
?Tis time indeed his little game was blown
Of pledging credit that, is not his own.?
Oh ! how I doat on mischief ; how I revel
In playing as my card the deuce?
{Sees Tarantula, who enters ) The Devil!
Why ! great Tarantula ! what brings you here ?
So ! out of work ? I'll set that right, no fear.
My giant brother, Gorgibuster flight,
Will make a raid upon this place to-night.
I thought the news would please you, Mr. Tarry,
So be prepared to help him rob and harry.
Get all your demons ready, that?s my hearty,
I never spied a more delightful party.
[ Exit Tarantula.
Now for my own pet scheme ?so long in brewin? ?
To hurl on those beneath that roof black ruin;
For yonder dwells of all my foes the chief,
A lad ordained to bring our tribe to grief
X T nless I stop his gallop ?as I mean to;
But first his lady mother must be seen to!
[ Makes passes, and retires.
(Re-enter Villagers, chuckling.)
Ciioetts ?(Air, The Bogie Mari).
Clck, olck, clck, here come the broker?s men!
They want the chairs and tables, and they?ll seize each cock and hen.
Clck, clck, clck, we?re sorry, mum, but then,
You?ve got no cash, and must go smash ?
Behold the broker?s men !
{Enter two typical broker?s men. As one of them seizes fearful portrait of
Dame's late husband, she stops him).
Dame Drop it, you brute ; isn?t your spite contented
Without the portrait of my late lamented.
See what a grace was seated on his brow,
And such a beak you don?t twig often now!
Sold up?oh fearful sell; my wits take flight;
Wouldn?t 1 warm ye though, if I were right!
Oh dear! oh dear! {weeps) and likewise?Ha! Ha! Ha! ( laughs )
Dolly Daisy-Dimple She?s quite hysterical.
Dame You?re right; I are!


(Song and dance .)
I.
When I opened my peepers this morning,
I said to myself, ? My dear boy,
1 give you most excellent warning,
The future I mean to enjoy.?
I scorn all life?s lessons pedantic ;
I cast them aside like a glove ;
I long for adventures romantic ;
In fact, I am yearning for Love.
Jack
I?m young ; I am full of ambition ;
I?m fairly good-looking I?m told ;
And so for the sweets of fruition,
Don?t fancy I?ll wait till I?m old.
Tra la la la la la la!
Oh no
/
Tra la la la la la la !
Oh no.
Tra la la la la la la !
No no.
Jack (without) Thanks, friends, for having come with me thus far ;
Here?s all my cash ! Pray share it (cheers), and ta ta!
(Re enters).
Give me joy mother, I have won the prize!
Each rifle-shot a hit, and all bulls-eyes.
Dame Hits! Rifles ! Bulls-eyes! when right well I know
Sheeps eyes at misses come from such a beau !
Jack Hallo, Mamma! Just hold her, two or three of you ;
Fit yet unfitting conduct this I see of you.
Whatever is the rumpus all about!
Dolly Daisy-Dimple Please, sir, the brokers.
Jack I?ll soon chuck them out!
(Assumes fighting attitude ) How will you have it ?
(Prompter seen to gesticulate) Eh ! a jiffey hold,
(Goes towards Prompter wonderingly.) Not in my part ?
Oh! ( Takes hag from Prompter; returns to Brokers.)
Here is the sum twice told.
Blush not to take it; every coin is blessed
By coming from ? oor Jimmy?s ? Treasury Chest,
And don?t smile either, for it is?Hooray 1
Part of the surplus we?re to have some day.
(Giving spirits.) There! Mow you?re better, mater; aren?t you?
Dame Rather!
Lor ?how you do remind me of your father;
He knew a drop of good stuff.
Jack So do you.
Dame My favourite, I declare, the Galley brew.
[Exit into cottage.
Jack (To Brokers-men.) Return those chattels'!� the O.P. side.
While I enjoy a warble and a glide.
No fun, lad, when you have grown old.


I?ve often been tempted to marry
A widow with plenty of cash,
But I thought it much wiser to tarry
Before doing anything rash.
In dreams there?s a maiden before me
Whose heart I am dying to gain ;
If I can get her to adore me,
My dying would not be in vain.
To wed her would be too delightful;
I?d always be faithful, I vow ;
So the widow, whose fifty and frightful?
Oh hang it! she?s not in it now.
No no, etc.
[ Exit Jack.
Enter Fairy Queen disguised as old woman, she begs. Villagers all refuse her.
F. Queen What ?not a copper ?not a single mag ?
Dame Well this is imperence. Be off, you hag.
Jack Your own sex, mother-mine, pray don?t be hard on,
My heart warms tow?rds her.
Dame Oh! I beg your pardon !
(Fairy Queen holds out her hand to Jack.)
Jack Relief? of course! (Searches pocket, then suddenly
and crosses to prompter), What! not another! No?
Not even of stage sovereigns?Here?s a go !
(To F.Q ) I?m very sorry?stop a bit ?this rake
A bob by selling that you?ll surely make.
Dame He takes m/ rake, well now ,'that takes the cake,
For he?s both rake and cake and no mistake.
F. Q. Your kindness I reward with more than gold,
For henceforth I?m your steadfast friend. Behold!
Jack The Fairy Queen !
F. Q. Correct.
Dame Oh ! goodness gracious!
I never seed a critter more splendacious,
Like a sweet bokay on a pair of stilts ;
Or like Lord Hopetoun dancing in his kilts.
Jack Thus on the Block I?d like to walk.
Dame Oh, walk her!
F. Q. But you must be a doer not a talker.
remembers
{Sound of horn)
You hear that horn ? Follow its sound my friend,
It calls to fortune, that you may depend.
Jack I?m off to meet my fate, Igo instanter {Exit.)
F. Q. And win life?s race, boy, in a lively canter. {Exit.)
Dame Jack win a race?won?t wash ?it ain?t Sapolio,
I?d rayther stack my greed upon Malvolio.
A fairy ?who?d have thought it! Jack?s no dunce ;
Ah, I was young ?like her ?and pretty once.
Premier And are so still.


Dame {Aside.) A male?a man? a dude,
I feel quite faint.
Premier I hope I don?t intrude.
Be not so flustered, tenderest of girls.
Dame (Aside.) Oh dear! I wish 1 had let down my curls.
Premier (Aside). Towards my scheme, kind Fate, pray prove propitious.
(To Dame). I came from court to court.
Dame (Aside). Oh, how delicious !
Premier In fact to woo you madam ,as a proxy.
Dame A how much?mister ?
(Aside). Ahem ! this smells foxy.
Premier The fact is? (hesitates).
Dame Yes, the fact is P Drive on faster.
Premier I?m here to represent my royal master,
His Majesty the King,
Dame The King?oh crikey !
The gent who wears a nobby crown all spiky.
Premier He?s killing game and shortly will arrive here,
While I (aside) to keep my little game alive here?
(Aioud) ?wish you to fall in love with him and he with you,
This philter fixes him, the rest you do,
Dame But 1 say Gruv?nor, hold hard, just go steady,
His royal nibs has got one Queen already.
Premier Pooh ! Pooh ! what?s that?when we both join our forces
Are there not such things, madam, as divorces.
She?ll see, and she'll suspect, she?ll stamp her heels,
And then she'll say ?
Dame Now blest be Mister Shiels,
Before me looms a crown, a second-hand one,
But razzle dazzle
Premier Ain?t the dodge a grand one.
[Exeunt.
Enter King, Queen, Lord Stanley, Prince Noodel, Courtiers, Ladies, Royal
Huntsmen, and Princess. Hunting Solo and Chorus.
Solo.? Princess.
When we?re hunting everybody should he jolly,
Laugh, chaff, shout, sing, to the winds with melancholy;

Farewell Care, and let us be blithe and gay.
Choeits.
Laugh, chaff, shout, sing, to the winds with melancholy.
Good-bye, Dull Care, since thou art the height of folly ;
From thy dark way let us far stray,
Out of the sight of thy visage grim and grey,

At M-rry Christmas-time

All The Princess!
King and Queen What?s the matter P
Princess Mamma!
My very noble and approved Papa;
Ladies and gentles, also, of the Court
As I was following our woodland sport,
I somehow lost my way, when in a trice
A hideous vision turned my blood to ice
An ogre!


King Now the good old pun, the ?chestnut??
Ogre o?gracious!
Princess Pa, I pray you jest nut.
He was a real live ogre ?in iiis socks
More than six feet, as stout as Mister?
Voice Zjx!
Princess Though no white waistcoat wore he. When he spied me.
In half a second ?pounce! he stood beside me!
? Ha, Ha 1 ? he cried, ? He, He ! ? and then ?Ho, Ho ! ?
? With me, young pusson, you must promptly go ! ?
Then tried to drag me off, when lo ! a youth
The sweet embodiment of Love and Truth?
Burst through the bushes, knocked the ogre down,
And freed me.
King I?d give half my?no, a crown,
To see that noble youth.
Princess (Laughing) Then pay the coin,
For here he comes, our company to join.
(Enter Jack. Princess runs to him.)
King {(sneezing) A-tissue! Hem ! My lad, your deeds we?re pleased at;
Your conduct really isn?t to be sneezed at.
We thank you, sir, and as for a reward,
Ask anything your monarch can afford ?

Stopped, are they ? ?Say that he?s an M.L.A.
Jack None of these boons I crave
Queen That?s better, far;
A saving of expense !
King Well, tra-la-la?
Jack But a still greater one? .
King Don?t understand.
Jack In good plain English then, your daughter?s hand.
Noodel I say, you know ?
Stanley and others We've got a voice in that!
Jack Your voices?Pooh! they?re like yourselves
Stanley and others Eh ?
Jack Flat!
Bid me do aught to prove my deep devotion?
Bathe in the Yarra?drink up half the ocean !
Beard our Domestic servants in communion;
Or act as Secretary to their Union.
King Since in yourself you place such firm reliance,
Suppose you rid the land of sundry Giants
Who now oppress it ?
Princess Don?t attempt it, dear!
Jack Pshaw ! I shall thrash the lubbers, never fear.
Produce the monstrous knaves ?deal the full pack;
At least I?ll die with harness on my back.
Where are these Giants ?


Premier Don?t be loud and hectory,
You?ll hardly find them, lad, in Sands? Directory.
Jack Oh, had I but the gentle fairy?s aid !

{Lies down on bank ; sleeps. Fairy Queen appears ,)
F. Queen In visions bright come steal his senses o?er
Heroes and heroines of nursery lore,
And while for him the bell of memory chimes,
Fairies attend and sing appropriate rhymes.
Ogre ( Appearing) Oh! very well; your rhymes are p?raps well-known,
But I?ll recite a version of my own.
( Various characters appear in Jack's dream.)
Fairies.
??Where are you going, my pretty maid ??
? I?m going a milking, sir,? she said.
? May I go with you, my pretty maid ? ?
? Nobody asked you, sir,? she said.
little Bo Peep
Has lost her sheep ;
She doesn?t know where to find ?em ;
Leave ?em alone,
They?ll come home,
And bring their tails behind them.
Little Jack Horner
Sat in a corner
Eating a Christmas pie;
He put in his thumb.
And he pulled out a plum,
And said what a good boy am I.
Jack and Jill
Went up a hill
To fetch a pail of water ;
Jack fell down,
And broke his crown,
And Jill came tumbling after.
Ride a cock horse
To Banbury Cross
To see a fine lady on a white horse ;
Rings on her fingers
And bells on her toes,
She shall have music wherever she goes.
Ogre.
? Where are you going, my pretty maid ??
? To the deuoe and the dickens,? Victoria
said;
? May I go with you, my pretty maid ? ?
?No one can stop you,? Victoria said.
Little Bo Peep
Has lots of sheep,
But she hasn?t got half a shearer;
John, Sandy and Mike,
They?re all out on strike.
And I fancy that will queer her.
Little Jack Horner
Bought a nice corner
Allotment when land was high,
Bat ruin has come,
And Jacky is dumb,
Or says. ?What a fool was 11 ?
Jack and Jill
They backed a bill
When shares were moving smarter,
But those shares fell down
To half-a-orown,
And others came tumbling aritr.
Ride a cronk horse
To be run on the cross,
And then fine the jockey?forbid him
the course,
But with rings on his fingers.
And those to his nose.
He will make money wherever he goer

At last she comes?my sweetheart?my Princess;
Now for our farewells and one fond caress.
(Enter Princess.)
Duet. ?Princess and Jack.
Princess
When you?re far away from me love,
Travelling thro? the forest wide,
All your thoughts must ever be, love,
Still with me, your promised bride.
You are right, love, in presuming
I shall feel but longing pain ;
Like a dove my pinions pluming
For my flight tow?rds home again.
Ensemble.
When | | Jack comes home again.
We'll be free from care and pain ;
Oh, what rapture sweet,
When once more we meet
Together to remain;
For we'll then renew each vow
That we make in sorrow now.
Oh yes, what sunny bliss 'twill he
When ? | Jack comes home again.
It will soothe my fond emotion,
Battling with untoward Fate,
When I think of your devotion,
Oh my darling promised mate.
Princess
I shall never cease to bless you ;
Night and day I?ll dream of you,
And in visions soft caress you.
Oh my sweetheart tried and true.

S. of M..
Ogre
I?m here, great master.
See that you weave your spells a little faster.
I do my best, but much prefer such charms
As do not work poor mortals lasting harms.
While you are my apprentice, night and day
You?ve but one duty?that is, to obey.
[Exit Spirit of Mischief.
S. of M.


Ogre Now for my vengeance ?gainst that puny boy
Who dared to rob me of my promised joy.
Should he outlive his coming trials strange,
May he be ruined on the Stock Exchange;
May Melbourne larrikins assault and mob him ;
May canting rogues in building comp?nies rob him ;
May porters jam his fingers at each station;
May he be put in?ah ?in liquidation ;
May hot winds frizzle him and cold blasts chill him ;
And if he can survive all that I?ll kill him. {Exit).

Ogre Rouse, brother, rouse !
Giant (Sleepily) All right.
Ogre I say all wrong,
The prey we seek will reach this spot ere long,
Then rouse at once!
Giant All ri?!
Ogre Quick, you slow coach !
Giant (Slowly rising) Well, what?s the row ?
Ogre The travellers approach,
We?ll watch them from yon thicket ?this way slink.

You won?t?not if I say I?ll stand a drink.

Jack Lo! here?s Pa?s sabre ?mother had the ticket?
It serves to cut a passage through the thicket,
The storm has ceased ?the tide of timpest ebbs.
McGuff. Weren?t they just whoppers, them big spider?s webs.
Jack But brushed aside as easily as that.
McGuff. Aisy now, boss, or sure you?ll spoil my hat.
Yerra, I?m tired ?if it?s the same to you
I?ll rest awhile. Oh! this'll never do.
Ah Mee No findee path.
Voices of Demons Beware ! you fools, turn back !
Jack Permit me to respond with ? Not for Jack.?
Voices Then meet your doom.
Jack Pshaw ! let my doom meet me.
McGuff. I shall chuck this.

Where black horrors darkly loom,
You but court an awful doom.
Doom, doom, doom

Jack, Jack, he strong and brave.
Fairies are near to save,

{Fairy Solo and Chorus.)
Fairy Queen Solo.
Ye nymphs of the waters obey me ;
Ye elves of the sweet summer air ;
Ye demons who seek to betray me ;
Give way to the power I bear I
All nature in soft smiling beauty,
Assists me in holding my sway ;
I live but for Love and for Duty,
Then love me?but loving, obey.


Chorus of Fairies.
Oh, we greet her;
Yes, we greet her ?
Our gentle fairy Queen.
And we treat her ;

With very humble mien.
But we love her ;

With all our fairy might:
None above her,
None above her,
Has any fairy right.

How lovely ! What a treat ?twould be for Guilfoyle.
So this is where your fairy hats you hang up ?
Really, one phrase alone describes it ?Rang up !

To graft you on some Melbourne stock I know!
Pack up at once your duds and Court regalia,
And take a passage with me to Australia.

That land of booms is not discovered yet!
Now bring the gifts that fairly are our guest?s,
To help him rid us of those monstrous pests.
This sword of sharpness take; it is as keen
As Purves? tongue ?
A sharper ne?er has been !
These shoes of swiftness ?once they were an editor's,.

You?ve a pretty wee waisty,
And lippies so tasty ;
I hope I shan?t be thought to he hasty,
If I embrace the one,
And the others, just for fun,
I must see if they?re tasty after all.
{Kiss.)
'Twas a pity to waste it,
Far better to taste it,
So on a spot that suits I have placed it.
Sometimes kisses go astray,
But mine wasn?t built, that way,
So I didn?t like to waste it after all.
F. Queen A\v.? The Mashah up to Fatah.
Ain?t lie nice, ain?t he sweet.
Quite the latest style,
With a face full of grace,
And a darling ducky smile
And his eyes mesmerize,
With really a magic charm.
But that smile will beguile.
Though he doesn?t mean any harm.
King Air. You fancy yourselves you do.
I lay?my snares ?put on airs,
I can look immensikoff,
Smile like this?go kiss kiss.
And then I give a gentle little cough (Ahtm!)
The girls I treat, say ? Sweet, sweet,?
They see I am a heavy toff,
But when I?ve won their little hearts
I trot right off !
Dame Air. ? You know a thing or two.
Oh ! yon like a fling or two ?yes you do,
Though your hairs are getting grey, just a few;
When Her Majesty ain?t by,
Or she winks the other eye,
Why you like a fling or two ?yes you do.


But we know a thing or two?yes we do,
Tho? you tell us fairy tales, just a few.
You?re artful and you?re fly, but your love is all my eye,.
For we know a thing or two?yes we do.
Air. ? Good on yer Mary Anne.
You shall hear them shout hooray,'
When your Jack returns some day.
As I really trust I may
If I the Giants whack;
Then the folk will all turn out,
Rich and poor, and thin and stout.
While the boys will loudly shout.

May fortune guide you, but whate?er betide you,

You?re bound to marry she.
Or else she has a notion of diving in the ocean.
And living with the mermaids at the bottom of the sea.

In case the giants make a sudden call.
Dress up ! Eyes right! Attention, rank and file,
Now forward ! march ! in ancient British style.

Dame Larkin spells embezzlement - T
Too much of Larkin we have lately had.
Ah Mee Him welly good pletend, but welly bad.
McGuffin D?ye think that Larkin preaches to his jailer ?
Dame Of course he does; and so does G. N. Taylor!
What?s this; the Eminent explorer here,
With all his little pygmies dressed so queer ?


(Enter Stanley ; he advances to Dame.')
?Stanley Jack?s mother, I presume P I grieve to say
In search of you I?ve lately missed my way. >
McGuffin Sure lovely woman lades most men astray. '
Stanley These pygmies, I confess, are but a queer guard ;
I hart a lot tho? when I lost my rearguard.
North West by North, half South, a trifle East (puttied).
(Pygmies tease McGuffin and Ah Mee).
McGuffin I shall chuck this.
An Mee No savee lilly beast.

And an illegant pot of gooseberry jam,
And some liquor to wash it down.

And there?s throtters and thripe?how?s that for high ?

McGuffin Chinkey, what?s that in your hat ?
Ah Mee This ? Local Option!
McGuffin Then I vote for that.
Dame You?re sure the Giant is nowhere about ?
(Spirit of Mischief appears at side, beckoning to Ogre, etc.)


Stanley Certainly not; am I not looking out ?
McGuffin Giants ! I shall chuck this !

(Comical Conclusion)
SCENE lI.?THE GIANT?S SUBTERRANEAN KITCHEN..
Princess The bare idea ?that I a princess?l!
Should have to make a common vulgar pie,
A mutton pie? I mutton?t and I shan?t,
Mainly, I must confess, because I can?t;
And yet I do remind me of a pie,
That killed a dozen boarders last July,
It?s meat was leather, and its dough was glue,
And such a pie I?d like to build for you.
Princess Solo.?Air. ?For You.
Ah ! you may keep me pris?ner here,
You great hig hulking brute,
But surely that would settle you.
A pie of meat or fruit.
The bride?s first pie her husband eats,
Till sadly does he rue
His faith in it ?well such a pie
I?d like to build for you.
For you, for you, you monster,
I wish that I could make,
Just such a pie of horrors
As budding cooklets bake,
For you, for you, you monster,
I feel that it would do,
For it would pi-son you-1 know.
That pie I?d make for you.
Of such a pie if once you ate.
You?d ne?er forget the day.
For ?twould bo quite a fortnight ere
The pain would pass away,
A sweet revenge I thus would gain
Of quite uncommon stamp,
And I would glory in your woes,
You huge ungainly scamp.
(Gorgihuster pushes Dame, McQuffin, and Ah Mee down staircase )>.


McGuffin I shall chuck this, ye bully, just you see!
Ah Mee You gleat big lallikin, you pushee me!

But to our Family Circle, come no more.
(Pointing to trap) That Stalls you off-- F�h ? Master Blunderbore.
(Giant roars and shakes head) What? Still obstrepelous! I?ll
? strike you dumb!
Off with his head! so much for Fee-fo-fum !
(Enter Fairy Queen),


F. Queen Don?t cut it, Jack ! Permit me, s?il vous plait ;
Let me behead him in a genteel way?
Around his pate I draw from left to right,
The magic circle of our fairy might.
Lo ! off it falls ?the body down will sink ?
But you, oh, Head! remain on earth to think;
And thinking, ponder, pondering, repent
Of all your evil deeds (Head moves off).
Jack That?s excellent 1
Good bye, old chappie ?Do try and keep steady
Although you?ve some excuse for being heady;
(To F. Queen) Note 1 deserve my princess for my pains.
F. Queen You do indeed, but something yet remains;
While you were settling that account just closed,
Your future Pa in-law has "been deposed ;
See where he comes?to exile he is sent!
I?ll leave you with him?soothe his banishment. (Exit.}
(Enter King Olorioso in rags and somewhat demented.}
King Farewell, a long farewell to all ray ?{sees Jack) Ha!
? Whom have we here ? {Capers) ri-fol-101-tra-la la!
Jack Do you not know me P
King Excellently well!
You?re a prawn-broker?Sydney shrimps you sell;
Methinks I met you at the baths, Geelong.
Jack Oh dear! Oh dear ! another head gone wrong!
King Yet I deserve it all, for flirting so ;
{suddenly) go to a nunnery?to a nunnery go !
[Exeunt*
{Enter Dame.)
Dame I?ve lost my royal lover ?aint it sad;
That blessed philter must have turned him mad
As other philters?water filters?do
With temp?ranee orators ?twixt me and you ?
Yet somehow with my loss I feel contented ;
It leads my thoughts back to my late lamented.
Ah ! shall I ever live to see his like;
My heart?s first hero- lost but sainted Mike.
Song-.
Its just about a year ago, I lost my darling Mike,
He led the unemployed you know, when they went out on strike.
And after that he drove a tram, that ran down Flinders-street;
Till they docked his screw?that settled him?he had to give up meat.
Chorus.
I could do as I liked with dear old Mike,
All the week from Monday;
He was happy as you please, on a crust of bread and cheese;
But he liked a bit of meat on Sunday.


?On Saturday when he came home, he gave me eighteen bob ;
To spread that over seven days was not an easy job.
You come to pay for schooling, rent, and get the old man?s clothes.
From ? Uncle?s,? there is not much left for luxuries Lord knows.
One Sunday we?d a dreadful row, I thought that we should part;
For dinner I had stuffed and baked a lovely bullock?s heart;
?Twas tender as a chicken, he declared that it was hard.
Then lifted up the window quick, and chucked it in the yard.
Some articles I lately read, ?twas in the ?Age ? broad sheet;
Accuse Victorian butchers of an overcharge for meat;
But the butchers say that?s ? all my eye,? their profit is quite low,
And bad debts swallow even that?l wonder is it so.
{Enter Fairy Queen and Spirit of Mischief.)
I\ Queen Since from the Ogre?s grip I?ve set you free,
Pray do a little bit of biz. for me.
S. of M. Right willingly indeed, Oh ! royal fay,
Give it a name?l hear but to obey.
E. Queen You see the couple spooning yonder nicely ?
?S. of M. The Ex-Queen and the Premier? Yes.
P. Queen Precisely.
The Giant?s castle scarce a mile from thence is,
You bring them there ? l'll bring them to their senses.
'[Exit Spirit of Mischief.
Now may I trouble you attendant fays,
Le Ballet de la Rage, the latest craze.
BALLET DE LA RAGE ( as danced at the Eden Theatre, Paris.)
SCENE lI.?THE GIANTS? CASTLE.
{Enter Premier.)
Premier My plot succeeds: The King is off his head
And off his throne, so I shall reign instead.
By right of conquest this belongs to me ;
In it a summer residence I see.
{Enter Queen sadly.)
Why so east down my sweet ?
I ask you how?d yer
Like to be called by such a name as dow?ger ?
I am no widow?
Queen
Premier
Yes you are ?a grass one,
But don?t you fret; a special law ?I?ll pass one?
Shall make you queen again?a nice divorce,
And then?
{Enter McOuffin.)


McGlufin Howld on, not quite so fast, old horse !
Premier What means this tumult. Calm yourself, my pet.
McQ-uffin It means, me bouchal, that you?re not boss yet.
[noise) Listen awhile, you?ll hear their voices ring?
?We vote for Jack ! aye, Jack shall be our king! ?
(Enter Jack).
Jack Where?s this usurper ?this most vile transgressor ?
Know that your king has named me his successor,
Which choice the people gladly ratify.
Premier (aside) There?s only one thing for it. I must fly.
Jack Stop where you are. Down on your bended knees.
Forswear all plots upon the crown to seize;
Your claims of ev?ry kind at once revoke.
Premier I do! Ido ! ?Twas but my little joke,
I only made love to the Queen in fun.
(Enter Dame.)
This was the one I meant?the genuine one.
Dame You weathercock !
McGuffin I never heard the like.
Dame? That voice reminds me of my sainted Mike,
?Tis you I choose ! (Falls in McOuffin?S arms).
Queen Can such sad flirting be.
Oh, my poor hubby ! let me fly to thee.
(Fairy Queen enters).
F. Queen Stay and repent ?your hubby is all right,
He?ll meet you cured ?
Queen But when ?
F. Queen To-morrow night!
And now (enter Princess ) brave Jack, here is the prize you sought,.
Take her, be happy !
Jack Well I think I ought.
(Enter Stanley).
Stanley What about me ? I?m not provided for.
(Enter Ogre).
Ogre And me!
All The Ogre!
Ogre I am one no more,
Behold the fruits of anguish and remorse,
I?ve been and listed in the Melbourne force,
At Dwyer?s shop they cropped my head of hair.
Stanley ?Twas quite a gaol and scissorer affair.
Ogre I got out, though.
All But how ?
Stanley The secret tell.
Ogre I gammoned that my name was Edward Bell,
? He?s innocent!? they cried ?in sudden fright,
? Clear off, and here?s ten pounds to make it right !? r
But there, no more of ill I?ll be a doer.


F. Queen Then Join?Lord Stanley in his lecturing tmlr,
Act as his agent.
Dame With a pot of paste.
F. Queen Now to our happy ending let?s make haste.
Jack A farewell ditty.
McGuffin Right yez are, I?m in it.
Princess {To Ogre) you haven?t sung to-night, so you begin it.
Ogre I only know two tunes, which do you mean,
God save the Weasel, or Pop goes the Queen?
Queen Pshaw ! something nice to end the pantomime.
Premier And make our friends return another time.
F. Queen I?m sure they?re pleased.
McGuffin Look at their smiles, hurroo!
Dame They liked my dress.
Stanley They liked my lecture too.
Princess Our barque sails well when they are at the tiller.
Jack To guide the course of Jack the Giant Killer.
Finale (Air ?Its all Over).
Princess We trust you all are satisfied, we?ve done our very best
Stanley To make the time pass pleasantly with merry song and jest.
Jack Pray draw on us without reserve ?our bank don?t mind a run,
Dame So come again another night and see our Christmas fun.
Choeus.
It?s all over ?all over,
That?s the story part we mean,
But watch the Transformation scene.
It all over ?all over,
Yet the best is coming after all.
Air ?(They all Came Back).
You?ll all come back; you?ll never stay away.
But nightly you?ll be trotting here to see our jolly play ;
We?re sure that you?ll believe us when we say you?re welcome back.
So come again another night to see friend Jack.
(All dance off.)
