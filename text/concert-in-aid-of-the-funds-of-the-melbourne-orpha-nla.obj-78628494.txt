I. Part Song.
H ro gramme.
TOat unites.
( Mendelssohn.)
What unites in distant countries
Hearts by fortune forc?d to roam P
?Tis the song whose spirit leads us
Back again to mem?ry?s home.
Let it sound in joyous measure,
Where our country?s sons unite,
Ev?ry heart will beat with pleasure,
And each song- give new delight.
Welcome bids each one the other,
All who speak his native tongue,
Ev?ry honest heart?s a brother,
High or humble, old or young.
Like the melodies that hind us,
Let the minds of all he free,
Heart, and soul, and will united
In the bonds of harmony.
Though at home we were but strangers,
Here sweet music links a chain,
Weaves a friendship everlasting,
Time shall seek to break in vain.
Welcome bids each, &c.


And if other ties should call us
To the joys of home again,
What in future may befall us,
Brothers true we?ll e?er remain.
Songs which here the flame rekindle
For our lov?d and native land,
Still shall bind our hearts together
And unite us hand in hand.
Welcome bids each, &c.

rii pt. (Signor Marliani.)
Stanca di piu combattere,
Con la crudel mia sorte,
Sento avanzar la morte,
Ma oh! dio lontan da te;
Seppi i sospir reprimere,
Penar, tacer, languire,
Or mi vedran morire
E non sapran, non sapran perclie
Sperava un giorno stringere,
La destra tua si cara,
Con guinto a te de vivere,
In sen di puro amor;
Ma lunge i fati trassero
Quelle adorate faci;
E a me dolente tolsero,
La speme del mio cor, ?
Ah! no m?ingannano,
I miei desir,
Lc liete immagini tulle sparir.


IV. Song, with Vocal Accompaniment,
Of gUipteft. fG. Reichardt.)
Tears of Anguish, cease your flowing,
Ere ye what I feel disclose,
Love, thou source of all my woes,
End within my breast this fervent glowing,
The greenwood heard my sad complaining,
The mountain with its echoes ringing,
Birds in sorrow held their singing,
Long ere day?s ,bright beam was waning.
Still from her my pain concealing,
I avoid to meet her gaze,
Could I from my heart erase
That fair form which caus?d this harrow?d feeling.

VI. Part Song.
iwmw�.
( Mendelssohn.)
She gladdens vale and mountain,
As far as we can see ;
She shines in ev?ry fountain,
And blooms on ev?ry tree.
From cloven rooks outpouring,
The streamlets trill along,
The birds to heav?n npsoaring,
All welcome her with song.


The captives in the bowers,
Cast off their torpid chains,
' She comes, and all the flowers
Salute her on the plains.
From all the heights resounding,
She makes the valleys ring;
The scatter?d brothers bounding,
Rejoice to hear her sing.
Her votaries united,
Resume their robes again ;
And are not we invited
To join her joyous train ? .
Her life-inspiring glances,
Enchant the hills and meads,
The hum of joy advances,
And follows where she leads.
VII. Song.
Stow itft turn* Md yet 00 fur. (A. Reichardt.j
I know an eye so softly bright,
That glistens like a star of night;
My soul it draws with glances kind
To heavn?s blue vault, and there I find
Another star as pure and clear
As that which mildly sparkles here.
Beloved eye, beloved star,
Thou art so near, and yet so far.
That eye so soft, like violets blue
A treasure bears of morning dew,
And when its light entranc?d I see,
What joy, what pain possesses me !
A world, where I would gladly dwell
Is that bright orb I love so well.
Beloved eye, beloved star,
Thou art so near, and yet so far.


VIII. Part Song.
( Annacker.)
Tho? our life of danger
Yields but scanty fare,
Joy is not a stranger
To the miner?s share.
Dauntless he performs his part
?Neath the face of earth so fair,
Where the sun ne?er glads his heart:
But the rays of hope shine brightly thei-e.
Trust in Heaven above,
And in God?s paternal care.
Fear not tempest raging,
Fear not dismal night;
Faith, the soul assuaging,
Dreads not all its might.
In God?s care confiding,
Of His help we ne?er despair,
In His ways abiding,
Humbly hope His mercy still to share.
Look to Heaven above,
Trust in God?s paternal care.
AN INTERVAL OF FIFTEEN MINUTES.

I. Serenade.
iflst, temt, vest.
(Kiicken.)
Rest, dearest, rest in thy bower,
Where nought thy calm slumber shall break.
While soft cooling breezes are flowing,
And nights deep?ning shadows are growing,
True love shall ne?er thee wake.


Sweet be thy sleep, till the first break of dawn
Herald forth the lovely morn,
Shall herald morning dawn,
Sweetly sleep till the morn.
Rest, dearest, rest in thy bower,
Through all the calm hours of night,
And when golden morning?s bright beaming,
Shall wake thee from happiness dreaming,
Then bless the new born light.
Sweet be thy sleep, &c.

(F. Aht.)
Day again his race has run,
And the tranquil night comes on ;
Soothingly her pinions waving,
Heated hill and valley laving,
Spreading from her starry chart,
Holy peace to ev?ry heart;
Holy peace to ev?ry dwelling.
All who rest in slumber?s arm,
Void of trouble, void of harm,
Heavenly angels now are guarding,
Every danger from them warding,
Powers of evil must depart;
Holy peace, &c.

Di gloria avampo e di furor

Splenda terrible sul traditor.
Se il ciel mi guida fausto m?arrida
Renda invincihile il mio valor.

V. Part Song.
Jamwli, thou Sorely forest yMc, ( Arranged by F. A.bt.)
Farewell, thou lovely forest glade,
With thy sweet cooling rustling shade,
It makes my very heart feel sore,
To think I ne?er may see thee more.
Farewell, sequester?d woodland dell,
When blooming flowers scent the gale,
Spread far your odours, sweet, and bloom
For other wand?rers yet to come.
And must I say for e?er farewell,
To thee, my lovely mountain dell,
No more remembrance shall destroy,
I still will think on thee with joy.

VII. Song.
g?H follow tlieo.
I?ll follow thee, wherever thou mayst go,
To the land of burning sunshine,
Or the realm of winter snow.
For the world is not as boundless
As a woman?s heart can be ;
So, wherever thou mayst wander,
I will follow thee!
I?ll follow thee, whatever thou mayst prize
Of fame or grandeur, to be won
Beneath the alien skies;
For the world owns no such treasure
As a faithful heart can be :
Then wherever thou mayst wander,
I will follow thee.

Part Song.
spring �imc.
( KreiUzer.J
Welcome gentle spring-time,
Thou dost e?er with joys abound;
With thy flow?rs again returning,
Breathing love to all around.
Throw thy verdant mantle o?er us,
Fill the air with fragrance mild;
Let the hawthorn?s blushing blossom,
Tell that gentle spring has smiled.
Bid thy songsters early hieing
Over valley, wood, and plain;
Bid the breezes softly sighing,
Say thou art at home again;
Bid the meand?ring murm?ring water,
Spread the news where?er they flow
And the sun new life imparting,
Make the heart with gladness glow.
IX. Part Song,
ftiulcuts? fmuj. ( Mendelssohn.)
Now in social throng,
Give the farewell song,
To the friend who soon must leave us
Journey with good cheer,
Whether far or near,
That we wish thee well, believe us;
Each on earth his way must measure,
O?er the paths of pain and pleasure,
Whether peace or strife
Be our lot in life,
Each on earth his way must measure.


Brother, now farewell,
Parting moments tell
How our hearts for thee are smarting ;
Dost thou feel as we,
Be in unity,
Still with us as were no parting.
May this comfort e?er attend thee,
Joy and happiness Befriend thee ;
And should fortune smile,
Think of us awhile,
Bygone days still joy will send thee.
Brother, take this hand,
Pledg?d to thee we stand,
That our friendship nought shall sever,
Honest, open, true,
In whate?er we do,
Envy should assail us never.
Some day, when each other greeting,
We enjoy such moments fleeting,
Then the pledge renew,
To each other true,
Fare ye well till our next meeting.
Fergusson & Moore, Printers, 48 Flinders Lane East, Melbourne.
