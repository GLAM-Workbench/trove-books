Chairman’s Address
THE CHALLENGE OF OUR DAY.
(Being the address delivered liy Air. I'ric X. Taylor
from the chair of the South Australian Congregational
I niou and Home Mission, Inc., April, .1943.)
As we meet together in this series of Assembly
Aleelings, we realize again that we are a section of the
world-wide Church of Jesus Christ. It is in this sense
that 1 wish to apply the title of this address. “The
Challenge of Our l)ay to the Church." and that means
to ns as members of the Congregational churches of
South Australia.
Xo one will deny the fact that from a moral, material,
or spiritual point of view, the world is in a sorry
plight. As a Christian section of the community, what
are we lining to improve the general position of the
world? We, as Christians, do hold the key to the
situation. For. did not Jesus say, “Seek ye first the
kingdom of Cod (f.c.. the things of the Spirit) and all
these things (food, raiment, etc.) will be added unto
von"? .And as we seek after the things of the Spirit,
our moral outlook is heightened. Thus, from a material,
moral, and spiritual sense the Christian Church holds
the key.
Thus comes the challenge of our day to do our part
in the bringing in of the Kingdom of Cod. This
challenge, 1 feel, is presented in a threefold manner:
fa) The Xeed of the World.
(b) Criticism of the Church.
(c) The Work of Other Sections of the
Church.
To meet this challenge, we must have and display
faith in the great Head of the Church and as His
witnesses, manifest Him to the world.
'fhe first aspect of the challenge comes from
The Need of the World.
The world at large seems to have lost its bearings.
War has torn asunder all the ties of possible unity
among the nations of the world. On the one side, it is
led by men who have utterly disregarded the Church of
Cod and have raised up. in some instances, the State as
their standard of worship. To fulfil their Inst for
power and position, the lives of men, women, and chil-
dren count for naught. Many innocent persons have lost
their all- homes, kindred, friends, and many others
their lives. Hunger and want, privation and fear are
the lot of those who in any way oppose these ruthless
war-lords. There is no need to remind my listeners of
the appalling conditions existing in the occupied coun-
tries of Europe.
On the other side are men with high ideals, as exempli-
fied in the Atlantic Charter, leading their nations. But
because war is war, they must meet the enemy's on-
slaught with sword and cannon, tank and battleship,
aeroplane and submarine, bomb and torpedo . . . and in
doing so bring to many (on both sides) losses which
are hard to hear.
We arc urged to pray for our enemies. For what
should we pray for them? Punishment? Forgiveness?
No! Rather that they may come to a full knowledge of
the love of Cod the Father of all mankind. As they
and ourselves realize the deep significance of His alf-
emliracing love, so will come a greater understanding
of each other and the possibility of peace.
Surely in this need for peace and brotherhood is a
challenge for the Church of Cod to bear its witness of
His great love. That love which did not withhold even
"his only begotten Son, that whosoever believelh might
have everlasting life.”
I have briefly referred to the world need from the
aspect of war. But crime breeds crime, and attendant
upon war there are other evils abroad, such as (in our
State) the betting question, the drink traffic, and. as
reported recently by our Commissioner of Police, an
increase in crime, particularly on the part of juveniles.
These items alone show a laxity in the moral outlook
on the part of the people. This, too, is a need which
challenges the Church to show its banner and endeavour
to raise the moral tone of our own people and the
people of all nations. Lack of church attendance and
'he apparent disinterest in matters of public morale
seem to he the chief causes for the lowering of spiri-
tual standards. 'Poo many of ns, to-day, are concerned
for ourselves only and not the nation or the world.
Let ns give whole-hearted support to those who are
keenly interested in the light against these evils. Such
organizations as the T inted Churches' Social Reform
Board merit our co-operation, and individuals who
make public utterance against the social evils of the
day should be shown that we are interested in their
outlook by the support we give them. As members of
the Christian Church we must make our witness to
bring about a deeper spiritual lone in our civil life.
Special days for national prayer do not make a
nation spiritual. The act of prayer must lie prac ised
by all, every day. This is when we, as professing
Christians, can set an example. For if we, who are
nominally in the Church of Jesus Christ, do not spend
time each day in prayer and meditation, how can we
learn the will of God for us?
In referring to the example to be shown to the world
brings me to the second aspect of the challenge:
The Criticism of the Church.
Criticism can act as a stimulus to action, particularly
if such criticism is warranted. What does the man
in the street say about the witness of the Church to-day?
Should we lake any notice of such criticism? I think
we should, for the opinion of the man in the street, at
the present time, would represent to a larger degree the
mind of the general public. His criticism is, therefore,
possibly, reflected in the statement made as recently as
last September by that eminent statesman. Sir Stafford
Cripps. “The Church has lost its strength because it
has failed to give the leadership for which the world
looks. . . . The Church is not regarded as the burning
fanatical champion of the poor and oppressed. It has
settled down to an easy acceptance of ‘society as it is.'
It has become part of existing civilization with little
regard for how far that way of life accords w-ith Christ’s
teaching.”
Let ns examine ourselves and our churches to ascer-
tain if such criticisms arc warranted and justified. Such
remarks are made of the Church as a whole, but we
must remember that the mass is made up of the indivi-
duals. Have our churches been making their mark
upon the community in which they are operating Have
you and I been living lives so that our lights have burned
so ilim that thev have not been seen of men ? Surely the


note of challenge comes to us to be worthy witnesses
of our Lord.
Another comment sometimes heard is that the Church
should have made a greater impact upon the nations
before the war and thus averted this world-wide
catastrophe of bloodshed and chaos. As Christians we
might say that the world in general would not have
taken heed or accepted our teaching. In a journal
kindly loaned me recently, I read this quotation from
"Political Science Annals,” by Nicholas Doman:
“There is little doubt that the Axis nations arc
fighting for world control, but it is seldom realized
that the United Nations are fighting for a form of world
control. They arc driven to aim at world control
because this is their only means to avoid world control
by their opponents. This is why the present war is the
first deliberate fight in human history for the political
organization of the whole world society. (“Christian
Century,” December. 1942, p. 1483.)
The writer of the article, having given this quotation,
goes on to say, “Nothing less than a great programme
to organize human life on the basis of humanity as a
whole, under God, is adequate for our day. The prob-
lem is moral and spiritual, and it is our Christian faith
that points the way.”
If we, as a Church, did not make sufficient impact
before the war, surely in the words of this writer there
is a challenge for to-day, to the Church to sec that
the programme for humanity as a whole is based upon
the things of God. When the details of post-war recon-
struction are being considered, the Church must bring
to hear such an influence on the deliberations that the
Spirit of Jesus Christ-—the spirit of sacrifice and
brotherhood —is manifested for the ultimate benefit of
all mankind.
When certain dignitaries of another branch of the
Church were appointed, the salaries of these men were
published abroad and the criticism was heard that the
Church was a money-making concern. These leaders
of the Church are undoubtedly aware of such comments
and I have read recently that one of these officials has
made a statement to the effect that steps w 7 cre being
taken to reduce their staffs so that such large sums
would not be necessary to provide for the upkeep of
such large households.
Taking such a criticism to the other extreme, then-
are men and women who serve in some churches for
less than the basic wage. These people who acknowdedge
the call of God for service may be prepared to make
such a sacrifice. But is it right? Here is indeed a
challenge for us to see that those who lead us in our
spiritual well-being are adequately remunerated. Such
criticisms must surely tend to quicken us and make us
face up to our responsibility so that the world may know
that the Church is the instrument of God for the
establishment of His Kingdom.
Down through the ages the Church, and those who
have served God's cause, have had to stand up to much
criticism aud also a greater amount of opposition.
Following Calvary and Pentecost, in face of severe
physical oppression to the point of martyrdom, the
Church, by its faith and witness spread through the
then known world. Persecution, the like of which is
being experienced in parts of the world to-day, was the
portion of those who professed the Christian faith.
Briefly, now, 1 would like to refer to several aspects
of the
Work of the Church in Other Lands.
In some parts of Europe, the Christian Church has
been forced to seek refuge and cover whilst the national
leaders have instituted a State Church which has as its
point of worship “The State” or “The Race.” In
Germany particularly is this so. Its leaders have sup-
pressed the Church and mocked and ridiculed its ser-
vices and sacraments. In place of Christ of Calvary
with the symbol of His cross they have put the nation
and the swastika. But thank God for the faithful
Christians, like Pastor Niemoller, who have suffered
and will suffer the ordeals of prison and concentration
camps rather than conform to any other worship than
that of our Lord Jesus Christ.
After many years under the ban of the laws of
Russia, the Christian Church was given permission
recently to again hold services. Although drastically
restricted for so long, the Church has arisen with a
most remarkable force. The time of testing has
strengthened the faith of those who had been unable
to meet openly for worship and fellowship.
In Japan Shinto worship has become State worship
and the Christian Church is being deprived of its former
liberty. Japan is not only taking of the things of
Caesar, but also something that is properly called God’s.
The Christian Church in Japan comprises only about
one-half per cent, of the population. Nevertheless, it
has gained, and is still gaining, influence, but is con-
fronted with the requirements of the State.
China, faced with the invading hordes of Japan, has
been forced to transfer its government aud a proportion
of its population inland, and in so doing the Church
has moved to these new centres With the migration of
the Chinese to inland China, the Church has shared
and the Christians have learned “that Christianity is
more than a movement, that it is a body and is made
up of living men and women w-ho stand by one another
in fair weather and foul.” (“The Church under Fire,”
by Chirgwin.)
A grave difficulty facing the Church in India is the
overcoming of a prejudice against a Western institution.
However, Indian adaptation of presentation of the
Gospel is helping considerably to meet this difficulty.
Mass movements have assisted to build up the numeri-
cal strength of the Church; and this strength will be
needed to withstand pressure from other sects in that
land of millions of souls with their present social system.
We recently read in the "Cougregationalist” where
the men of the L.M.S. have continued to man their
stations in Papua in face of many setbacks and dis-
appointments. The recent evidence of the service ren-
dered by the “fuzzy-wuzzy angels” to the wounded men
of the Australian forces in the Owen Stanley Ranges
tells of the value that the Church has been in Papua.
The Rev. L. H. Hurst says, “None but the basely
ungrateful can fail to desire for them the best that
can be given.”
From my reading of various journals there appears
a trend toward unity, if not union, on the part of the
various sections of the Church, both in England and
in the United States of America. United witness on
public questions must be recognized by communal and
governing bodies, whilst the spiritual benefits of any
co-operative action would be far-reaching in their effects
on the meml)ership of the respective denominations.
Surely such revelations of the work and witness of
the Church of God in other lands, together with the
need for further co-operation for the extension of the
Christian community in our own land, sounds a chal

lenge which we must not leave unheeded, for it has
been truly said that the Church without a missionary
outlook is dead.
The Answer to the Challenge.
How, then, are we to face up to the challenge of the
day as 1 have presented it? My answer could be given
in a few words; earnest, personal consecration to our
Lord. But such words have some vital implications
which must be considered, I have already mentioned
that the mass is made up of individuals, therefore,
before the Church can be truly effective in the carrying
out of its task of establishing the Kingdom of God,
there must be a personal devotion to Jesus Christ.
The world is in need and that need is spiritual,
therefore we must make our individual impact on the
lives of men and women with whom we come into
contact. It is not given to everyone to be able to
preach but each one who is in earnest can witness to
his or her faith. This witness may be by word of mouth
or by our manner of living.
We may not earn a reputation like Paul and Silas,
of whom it was said, “These arc they that have turned
the world upside down,” but we can bear our testimony
before the world that we have been with Jesus and
have learned of Him.
Thus there is the necessity of personal consecration
with the practice of private devotions being consistently
observed.
To reply to the criticism of the world our lives must
he in accord with the example of Jesus who went about
doing good. We must therefore make our mark in the
community by our thoughtfulness for others, by means
of persistent endeavours for the betterment of social
conditions, and taking our stand on public questions.
One of our national leaders recently said, “Sunday
is an inheritance of the British Empire.” Let us
observe the day in its rightful way by attending the
House of God and enjoying the fellowship of kindred
minds. Also, to encourage our children and young
people to consistent attendance and participation in
Sunday school and other youth organizations associated
with the Church for their well-being. These young
people of to-day are the citizens of to-morrow We
must therefore give them the right training that they
may take a worthy place in the community. Some of
you who are older might offer your services to your
ministers or Sunday school superintendents in order to
help in leading the young people in the paths of righ-
teousness The work and witness of the Church in other
lands demands our support. This part of the extension
of God’s Kingdom is being carried on by His servants
who face dangers and difficulties for His sake.
It is up to us to support those who so labour for the
ushering in of a world-wide Church by our cheerful
and prayerful giving.
Thus by our personal devotion to Jesus Christ, our
personal living, and our prayerful giving will we meet
the challenge of the day. Will you, with me, re-
consecrate yourself to the Lord?
Never letting your zeal flag,
Maintaining the spiritual glow,
Serving the Lord!

The Home Mission Field Overseas missions
Rev. KATE HUXLEY is pastor of a district of four
thousand square miles in the beautiful mountains of
South Fukien, with Ting Chow as a centre. Often cut
off from all contact with her own race through air raids,
food and money shortages, and sometimes a rather
desperate loneliness, with courage and humility she brings
Christ’s spirit of peace to a section of a war ridden land.
Rev. K. Hutley.
Rev. E. R. FENN hails from Poplar, in the East End
of London. He migrated to Western Australia and
gained much and varied experience in the "outback.’
From there he came to South Australia and was for some
time at Tintinara. He became associated with our Church
there and felt a definite call to missionary work. Though
greatly handicapped by deficiencies of education, he
entered Parkin College and accomplished a creditable
course of study, passing all subjects for L.Th. with the
exception of Greek and Hebrew. He joined the College
Park church and gained considerable preaching experi-
ence in our S.A. churches. Leaving college at the end
of 1937 he was ordained to the ministry on November 24
in the College Park church, married on the following
evening to Miss Ida Prosser, of Tintinara, and sailed for
Papua immediately afterwards. He was stationed at
Aird Hill, famous as the centre of the labours of the
Rev. B. T. Butcher. His practical common-sense and
working knowledge of such things as building and
engineering, together with his wife’s excellent nursing
qualifications, greatly helped the work. When the Pacific
war broke out, he collected a number of women and
children from various places on the Papuan coast and
personally navigated his launch across the Torres Strait
to Thursday Island, whence the party was flown by air
to Cairns After a brief stay in Adelaide, Mr. Fenn
returned to his post. His knowledge of the native lan-
guage and his ability to manage natives enabled him to
be of service to the Papuan Government. Mr. Penn is
very much "a man’s man” and his vigorous personality
is likely to make him one of our most distinguished
missionaries.
Dr. BERYL BOWERING is a granddaughter of a
Congregational minister, the Rev, A, A. Munns, who
laboured for a number of years in South Australia and
in Tasmania; and also a granddaughter of a famous
Methodist minister, the Rev. J. G. Wright. Her parents
belong to the Baptist Church, and thus her youthful
outlook was largely developed through experience with
these churches.
Dr. Bowering during preparatory years gave largely of
her time and her rich Christian character to all types
of Sunday School and church work. It was characteristic
that while eagerly pursuing her studies at college, and
even in the more arduous application necessary for her
medical degree, her love for her Master and for the
Kingdom led to ever increasing service.
Following upon graduation, an application to the
London Missionary Society led to appointment in India.
Here she still labours at Jiagang one of the most
radiant and joyous of missionaries. Her visits to South
Australia and the other States, her fascinating letters to
the press and to countless friends, reveal a faith and
self-sacrificing love, the sight of which is a most refresh-
ing and stimulating experience.
Dr. Beryl Bowering.
Dr. HENRY COLLIN ROBJOHNS was born at the
manse, Keyneton, on June 28, 1902. He was the first
dux of King’s College and after he had completed his
studies at Parkin College and the Adelaide University


he graduated in medicine and surgery at the Adelaide
University, 1932. In the following year for further
experience he served on the staff of the Perth Hospital.
In February, 1934, he married Dorothy E. Haslam,
daughter of Mr. J. A. Haslam, headmaster of King’s
College. He and Mrs. Robjohns then proceeded to
London, where he gained at the London School of
Tropical Medicine his diplomas in tropical medicine and
hygiene.
Having been appointed to take charge of the hospital
and leper station in Siaokan he and Mrs. Robjohns
sailed for China early in 1935. Later he moved to
Hankow where he was appointed on the staff of Union
Hospital, Hankow.
War broke out between China and Japan. In 1936
the bombing of Hankow was so severe that all women
and children were compelled to leave Hankow, and Mrs.
Robjohns returned to Adelaide with their little daugh-
ter Margaret, and her husband went on to Tsaoshih to
take charge of the hospital in that town. He was in
residence there when the Japanese army occupied
Tsaoshih.
* * *
These, our own missionaries, found their inspiration
and vision of the world’s need in the churches of their
Homeland. Hence Home Mission funds are of prime
importance in your personal budget and that of your
church.
Dr. Collin Robjohns.
The C.C.M.A.
Two yeacs.ago, on Monday, March 31, at a dinner held
at John Martin’s, attended hy about 150 men, a Con-
gregational Men’s Association was formed, and officers
appointed. All the men in our churches are asked
to join.
Branches should be formed in all our churches. The
other religious bodies have their men’s societies. We
must not lag behind.
We suggest regular monthly meetings ■—Sunday after-
noon, after church on Sunday night for a social hour,
or mid-week Invite, from time to time, the men from
neighbouring churches to join with you. Think out the
programme well ahead. Arrange for good speakers,
also if possible a men’s choir.
Begin to make plans for welcoming home returned
men. See into the possibilities of getting employment
for them.
Support local and central rallies. There are to be
central rallies each year also evening functions.
An enthusiastic Men’s Association can make its presence
felt in the community.
We count on your support.

Congregational Union and Home Mission of S.A, (Incorporated)
ANNUAL REPORTS
"None but an author knows an author’s cares.
Or fancy’s fondness for the child she bears.”—Cowper.
REPORT OF EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.
Your Executive, in presenting its report, directs
attention to the new system inaugurated by the Council
at its last annual meeting.
It will be remembered that work which had for many
years been in the hand of the Secretary was divided
this year between three officers, viz., the Moderator,
Youth Director, and the Secretary. This has pro-
foundly affected the whole results of the year. The
change is noteworthy also as providing the fresh,
invigorating atmosphere in which the whole denomina-
tion rejoices.
It has been in several respects an expensive year but
over against that may be set the realization of an
enlarging field, new responsibilities, and satisfactory
signs of development and permanent growth. These
will be shown in detail in reports of the various branches
of Union activities but close association with the field
covered by the Moderator warrants your Executive in
drawing attention to the wise direction he has constantly
given the churches, the whole-hearted devotion with
which he has freely spent himself in their interests and
those of the denomination.
The area of work occupied by the Youth Council and
its associated body, the Youth Fellowship, will be fullv
discussed in their reports, but it is due from your
Executive that it express appreciation of the enthusiasm
and vigorous activity manifest in such efforts as that
of the Town Hall musical festival and the youth rallies,
also in the Sunday school examination.
The establishment of a Literature Department has
had the heart}' endorsement of the Finance Committee
of the Executive. There are already evidences of
satisfactory financial results. The publication of the
Year Book, the Constitution, the Congregational Calen-
dar, and denominational literature has been considerably
aided by this department.
In reviewing other changes it is advisable to note the
satisfaction of your Executive in the institution of a
United Board to deal with matters relating to army
chaplains. The fact that the appointment of the chap-
lain is an ecclesiastical one and not primarily a military
one has been recognized in the constitution of this board
and clarifies the whole position.
The work of the hospital chaplain, so long carried
on by the Rev. David Morgan, has been undertaken
by the Rev, Alan P. Farr, who is already under the
spell of its inspiring and rich rewards.
There has been notable progress in relation to the
Congregational Men’s Society and the letters C.C.W.S.
and C.M.S. promise to become outstanding in South
Australian Congregational history.
Your Executive has maintained constant correspon-
dence with the Canberra church and assisted both the
building and stipend funds of the Canberra Committee,
Representation on various public bodies has been con-
sistently maintained and their work periodically
reviewed.
Inter-denominational relationships are perhaps closer
and more cordial than ever. The significant gesture
made by the three Flinders Street churches, Presby-
terian, Baptist, and Congregational, in their united ser-
vices has had a healthy effect on the South Australian
viewpoint. The union of interests of Baptist and Con-
gregational churches at Broken Hill'—the several meet-
ings with Anglican, Hebrew, and several non-con-
formist churches, concerning a special joint interest,
and the friendships engendered by meetings concerning
social reform have, with the work of the Council of
Churches, all contributed largely to a cordial under-
standing and fellowship.
A number of our churches have been deeply interested
in providing welcome and entertainment for the soldiers
of both the American and our own forces. Members
and adherents gave valuable service in this direction.
We have one memory taking us even further afield.
All will recall with pleasure our happy association with
hundreds in this land in contributing to the fund for
forwarding to the brave troops, amid the ice and snow
of Russia, the sheepskins from Australia.
Before enumerating changes in pastorates and supple-
mentary items, your Executive records unceasing appre-
ciation of the work of the Chairman of the Union.
The year of office of the Rev. H. Watts Grimmett will
be long remembered as one wherein service was ren-
dered with a quiet effectiveness which was the more
appreciated because of the sturdy, vigorous faith that
endorsed and permeated all that was done. Our churches
have been uplifted, the denomination strengthened,
and the community given a glimpse of manhood it
seldom sees but ever welcomes and remembers.
Ordinations this year include those of Revs. A.
Rodney Mitchell, LTh., Wreford R, Trestrail and
Norman A. Fraser. Induction services recall the
names of Eric Chadwick, L.Th., G. H. Cleaveley, Alan
P. Farr, E.Th., A. W. Gordon, G. H. Hume, G. Lindsay
Lockley, 8.A., 8.D., S. H. Mayes, S. W. Parker, P. H.
Rowland, W. J. Williams, Miss Noble,
Among those whom the churches recall with loving
regard men and women to whom the home call
has come we number the Rev. Ernest Weymouth, Mrs,
Chas. Watts, Mrs. R. Hogarth, Mrs. D. McFarlane,
Mrs. B. Trowbridge, Miss Anderson, Mrs. Wm. Evans,
Mrs. A. C. Newbury.
JAS. E. CRESSWELL,
Secretary.
Addenda to Executive Report.
NOTE OF APPRECIATION.
As the retiring Chairman of the Union I take this
opportunity to express on behalf of the Executive our
appreciation of the valuable services rendered to the
denomination by the Rev. J. E. Cresswell. Mr. Cress-
well assumed the responsibility of the Secretary’s office
when the denomination was faced with a difficult situa-
tion occasioned by the passing of our late and esteemed
Secretary (Rev. E. J. Stacy).
It has been for Mr. Cresswell a difficult year in that
he has had to feel his way and make himself acquainted
with the office routine and its exacting requirements. It


it not too much to say that the improvement in the
financial outlook of the Union, as well as the marked
efficiency in office routine, is due in large measure to his
leadership.
We thank Mr. Cressvvell for services rendered, and
express the hope that the way may still be open for
him to serve the denomination in this capacity.
H. WATTS GRIMMETT.
HOME MISSION BOARD, 1943.
The Board has this year found considerable help in
its activities in the regular and wide-ranging reports
presented by the Moderator.
In the increasing shortage of suitable men for the
ministry the whole of the Board’s work would have
severely suffered had it not been for the Moderator’s
monthly survey of the whole field and his carefully
weighed advice.
The favourable reaction of the Kapunda church to
the change in its pastorate, the excellent response to
placing the Rev. G. H. Cleaveley at Frances, the rich
results accruing from the induction of Miss Noble at
Gilberton are but a sample of changes the credit of
which largely goes to the Rev. H. S. Grimwade.
There has been ready endorsement of much that he
has suggested and your Board most cordially expresses
its thanks to one whose genial fellowship has given
added pleasure to all the deliberations.
The satisfaction felt in reviewing the settled pastor-
ates of 1942-3 is considerably enhanced by the steady
and generous response of almost all our churches to
the establishment of the “Penny-per-week” gift to home
missions. That this has occurred in a year that abounded
in calls upon the public, that it was taken up enthusias-
tically by churches of small and large membership, that
the church meetings found many new methods of
collecting the amount, has given your Board the
greatest encouragement. There are a few churches that
totally failed to respond, also some whose large member-
ship led to expectation of larger results, but these
doubtless will seek to take their place with those whose
liberality has been so noteworthy.
The quarterly questionnaire to home mission
churches and the forms recently issued concerning the
yearly grants have been most cordially approved. These
have put your board in possession of information that
is invaluable in estimating the real needs of the assisted
churches.
Grants .which total £455 in aid of ministerial stipends
were possible through the generous bounty of the
churches. It is these altogether inadequate stipends that
constitute the claim upon the whole fellowship for
regular, thoughtful, and large-hearted giving. The
“Penny-per-week” in such a setting becomes merely a
working minimum. The large majority of members
will have a much higher ideal.
There are movements afoot concerning the Broken
Hill church that are encouraging. The church was
visited early in the year by the Chairman-elect and
Mrs. Taylor. The Rev. S. H. Mayes went as a deputa-
tion for your board and the Secretary has been in con-
stant correspondence with the church. In the recent
united efforts of the Baptist and Congregational
churches there are most hopeful signs of developments
which should fully establish these churches in this
most important centre.
“Whitefield’s,” Halifax Street, and Point McLeay
Missions all continue their beneficent work. The war
has affected all in certain directions, but there are still
constant evidences of the need for loving Christian
sympathy, wise direction and counsel, and assistance
also in periods of poverty and distress.
The Future. The question is already being dis-
cussed wdiether it would not be advisable to encourage
the establishment of an order of deaconesses. The
success that has followed the introduction of women
into almost every branch of industry is an indication
of what might be expected. The example of the
Roman Catholic, Anglican, Presbyterian, and Methodist
churches, not to mention others, are worthy of con-
sideration.
The Council will be asked to appoint a special
Forward Movement Committee during these sessions.
It is recommended that the committee consist of a
small personnel, men fully conversant with city and
suburban areas, that their work be to see and report
upon lands owned in these areas, also to report upon
areas newly settled which should have the attention
of the denomination. Further, that they report to the
Home Mission Board and that recommendations be
endorsed by the Executive prior to action.
It is desired in conclusion to express to ministers of
all our home mission centres the appreciation of the
board concerning their devoted ministry. Centres far
afield — such as Port Pirie or Milang — where the
Rev. H. Wood and the Rev. J. Digance labour, or one
such as Gawler district, with its arduous State-school
work — or Port Elliot, which is deeply indebted for its
new buildings to the work of the Rev. D. L. Benton,
Wallaroo with its special claim — these, one and all,
with the southern churches, Gilberton, and Semaphore,
owe much to the wise leadership and inspirational ser-
vice of the pastor. The Home Mission Board tenders
to each grateful thanks for all the devoted service
of 1942-43- „ „ „ _
JAS. E. CRESSWELL,
Secretary.
FINANCE COMMITTEE REPORT.
The total receipts for 1942 amounted to £1,659 11/10.
Payments for the same period to £1,574 9/8.
Various viewpoints, however, are necessary in order
to correctly estimate the position of our funds. It will
be noticed that there are four jnain items in our
receipts. These are income from investments, annual
and half-yearly meetings, contributions, and sundry
accounts. These represent a total of £1,113 6/5. This
is the actual income to meet current expenses. These,
shown, on the other side are as follows: Annual and
half-yearly meetings, grants, administration, moderator’s
expenses, sundry accounts. The total of these is
£1,078 4/3. This indicates a credit balance on the
year’s transactions of £35 2/2. This is the amount bv
which the debit balance of last year has been reduced.
The general outlook is much more favourable and
your Finance Committee directs attention to the
following:
The contributions from churches to home mission
funds amount to £515 11/9, those of the Ladies Auxi-
liary to £80, and from sundry sources £32 0/4, a total
of £627 12/1.
Your committee has lowered administration costs bv
£60, there is a credit to the reserve account of £33 2/-
and to the emergency fund of £83 16/11. The “sundrv
accounts” reveal an advance of over £142 in sales.and,
coupled with the assets of the Literature Department,
speak of an important addition to the favourable finan-
cial aspect of the funds.


Without being unduly optimistic your Finance Com-
mittee views the coming year with confident hope. The
chief factor in creating this confidence is the gradually
developing adherence of the churches to the weekly
offering for home missions. A thoughtful consideration
of the detailed list of contributions bears outstanding
evidence of a generosity of many that far exceeds the
modest “Pcnny-per-weck” and should induce a reflective
mood in those churches not achieving that amount.
Your committee envisions in the coming year such fur-
ther strengthening of the position that it will be able to
release funds to the Home Mission Board for work in
the newly-settled areas.
It desires in conclusion to express its thanks to the
Treasurer, who, amid many professional duties, has ever
given thoughtful and prompt assistance to every phase
of its work.
Finally, it would express to the churches appreciation
of an encouraging, liberal giving by which they have so
emphatically endorsed the words of Sir James Car-
michael, a noted Congregationalist, who said, “No
amount of money that any of ns can give will ever
repay our indebtedness to the Church for what it has
done for us.”
JAS. E. CRESSWELL,
Finance Secretary.
FORWA.RD MOVEMENT FUND.
A special committee to consider the question of
properties under the control of the Home Mission Board
is to be appointed by this Council. In view of this,
properties associated with the Forward Movement (this
being under the control of the Home Mission Board)
arc of particular interest.
Of nine churches indebted to the Forward Movement,
five have paid interest, one has paid off its debt, and
the loan made to the Parkin Mission for the erection of
the Encounter Bay district manse has been repaid. The
present total amount on loan to the churches is
12,445 16/7. The nominal value of unused land is now
£1,498 0/10. Owing to repayment of two substantial
amounts the credit balance at the bank to December 31,
1942, was £1,606 6/5.
Much time and considerable thought and planning
years ago led to the establishment of this fund. Remem-
bering the rapid settlement now taking place in a number
of suburbs and the promise of further extension in
post-war days, there is a demand for statesmanlike
planning, not only for wise ministers and capable busi-
ness officers for our churches, but for men of affairs
who shall be in charge of the Forward Movement
Funds, both to control and direct this branch of Con-
gregational church life.
JAS. E. CRESSWELL,
Finance Secretary.
PARKIN MISSION REPORT.
BARMERA. Keen and vigorous, the Rev. L. G. C.
Plcass has steadily throughout the year maintained his
ministry in this district. He rejoices in the excellent
service rendered by the deacons, especially in the assist-
ance of the secretary, Mr. R. James. Barmera prospects
are good.
COOMA.NDOOK DISTRICT. Under the thought-
ful care of the Rev. S. Roberts this area is steadily
progressing. A fellowship has been formed at Ki Ki.
The activity of a fine band of lay-preachers has been
a valuable factor in the progress of the work in
Coomandook, Coonalpyn, and Ki Ki.
DEVON PARK. The Rev. W. J. and Mrs.
Beasley have ministered to this church throughout
another year and their loyal service has been much
appreciated. Impending changes in the pastorate arc
affecting the present conditions but there arc prospects
of helpful developments.
Rev. H. S. Grimwade, B.A.
Again elected as Moderator
FRANCES DISTRICT. This comprises the three
areas known as Frances, Wattle Grove, and Binnum.
The settlement here during 1942 of the Rev. G. H.
Clcaveley and his family has been a fortunate and happy
event. The wide experience in pastoral duties, the
ready understanding of country life with its special
problems, and quick Christian sympathy of both the
pastor and his wife have opened for them a way to their
people that is of inestimable value.
GROVENE. This church has had the sympathetic
oversight of the Rev. Wm. Hawke for the greater part
of the past year. Excellent service has also been given
by Mr. T. C. Rice who is now our student pastor at
Salisbury.
HALIFAX STREET. Mrs. Bradbury, who was
in charge of this mission, was unable to continue and
for many months the ministry of Mrs. W. E. Mounster
has brought both joy and thankfulness to many homes
in the neighbourhood. One recalls also the continuous
help given on alternate Sundays by the Rev. G. Slade
and the Rev. G. A. Cooper, L.Th.
KEITH DISTRICT. There are few who knew
Keith and Tintinara in early days who forecast the
development which has taken place. This progress is
as noticeable in church life as in farming. The progress
of these churches promises in the near future to release
the Parkin Mission for extended service elsewhere.
The governors congratulate the Rev. Victor Woolley


and his people on the prospect of achieving that inde-
pendence which is the ideal of our denominational life.
LUHR’S ROAD. The fellowship of this church
has appreciated the thoughtful ministry of the Rev.
Rodney Mitchell, L.Th., during 1942. There is most
loyal, loving help given to both church and Sunday
school by an indefatigable band of workers.
MANTUNG. The settlement of the Rev. Eric
Chadwick, L.Th., brought a promise of new life to this
large district. Mr. Chadwick comes with several years
of experience in Tasmania and, entering upon his
work with the vigour of youth, has awakened happy
anticipations in the denomination, as well as in that
district.
SWAN REACH. The inclusion this year of two
places usually served by the resident minister at
Mantung, has added considerably to the work of the
Rev. Wreford Trestrail. However, he rejoices in
efficiency and brings to the search for it not only en-
thusiasm, but the careful thoughtfulness of one of
mature years. This district is very happy under his
ministry.
ENCOUNTER BAY DISTRICT. The Rev. D. R
and Mrs. Maschmedt, now comfortably settled in their
attractive new manse, are reaping already the joys of
their joint ministry. They are beloved of their church
folk, their life rich in devoted service, the promise
of the days ahead bright and fully assured.
LOXTON. Here, as at Swan Reach, the minister,
Rev. Ronald Woods, has been working in part of the
Mantung area as well as that of his own. Mr. Woods
has met the extra calls upon his time and strength
with abundant ability and joyful spirit. It has been a
pleasure to read the reports of one seized of the joy
of yeoman’s service.
RENMARK. The Rev. L. G. Kay, whose work at
Cheltenham was such a joy to the denomination, has
had a year of praiseworthy toil at Renmark. He Is a
“man amongst men” with all the implications of that
fine idea. Renmark has been given a glimpse of a
vigorous Christian ministry that will be long remem-
bered. The “hopefulness and satisfaction” noted in last
year’s report has grown with passing months and
pastor and people enter 1943 with glad expectancy.

Secretary.
REPORT OF LADIES’ AUXILIARY TO HOME
MISSIONS. 1942.
In accordance with the feeling of the members (in
view of the many calls of a patriotic nature) our
central meetings have been few. It is with a deep
sense of gratitude to the women of our churches that
in view of this they have seen to it that the financial
position was not weakened, but wonderfully streng-
thened.
At the business meeting in February it was decided
in place of the tea a festival luncheon be held, and,
aided by the churches, this proved highly satisfactory.
Annual H.M. Rally. There was a fine gathering
which gave courage and inspiration to face another
year, which held problems and difficulties hard to over-
come. Mrs. H. Grimwade was in the chair and wel-
comed representatives from the Baptist, Salvation Army,
Church of Christ, and Methodist H.M. associations.
Reports of secretary and treasurer were adopted. To
the roll call 42 churches responded with greetings, with
over 200 women present. Mrs. Brigadier Harew'ood
took the theme of the meetings, “Our Place in the New
World Order,” as the basis for her address. After
the collection (£6) Mrs. Grimwade made the offertory
prayer. Two solos were rendered by Miss Sylvia
Thomas and musical numbers by the Vardon Memorial
guild members, with Mrs. D. Traeger at the organ,
who led the community singing. Officers elected were:
President, Mrs. Watts Grimmett; vice-presidents, Mrs.
E. Wilckens, Mrs. E. Taylor; treasurer, Mrs. A. E.
Peters; secretary, Miss L. Ekers; assistant secretary,
Mrs. A. Wood; reporter, Mrs. R. Abbott.
Mrs. Grimwade introduced the incoming president,
Mrs. Watts Grimmett, who took the chair and gave a
short inspiring message for the days ahead, with the
hope for better ones in the new world order. It was
a happy thought from Mrs. Grimmett to ask our loved
member, Mrs. Cornish (unable to be present) to choose
the closing hymn. It was decided to send a letter to
the guild members at Broken Hill expressing sympathy
in their present situation and our gratitude for their
steadfast and loyal work through many years.
Our annual social gathering, held in Stow Lecture
Hall, was well represented by the churches and the
president voiced the feeling of thankfulness for this
when there were so many calls on everyone in these
anxious days, A letter of acknowledgment was received
from the women of Broken Hill, also from the Secre-
tary of the Union, expressing thanks for the response
to the budget.
Mrs. Denis Ryan, as speaker, took for her heading
“0.H.M.5.,” and listed it into four parts: Ourselves,
Homes, Mates, and Society, and sincere appreciation
was felt when it was realized under what strain she had
given her service, as sudden bereavement had come to
her that day, but she felt she must carry out her
promise to spaek. Our sympathy was carried by
silently standing.
The birthday meeting, held in August, was a happy
and successful one with Mrs. Watts Grimmett in the
chair. “Proverbs” was the thought of the afternoon
and each item was in accord and well arranged. The
main item was the birthday offerings from the guilds
and 20 churches responded with their gift with promise
of further donations from those absent. With the
collection over £23 was received and thanks was given
by the singing of the doxology. Afternoon was catered
for and no charge on the churches. Regret was felt
that Mrs. A. E. Peters was unable to be present through
illness and a message of sympathy through the president
to be sent her.
In October we were indebted to the C.Y.F. for the
use of their room, when Mrs. Grimmett opened a dis-
cussion on “Constructive Work in the Church.” Mem-
bers told of the work in theirs, the difficulties that had
to be met, and helpful ideas exchanged.
U.C.W.A. Musical At Home in the Town Hall.
Mrs. A. Wood reported the financial result from our
Auxiliary women was excellent and appreciation of the
response for afternoon tea and arrangements at the
official table which was Congregational this year. At
the U.W. intercessional service held in the Unitarian
Church, we were represented on the programme by
Mrs. Kick, Mrs. Watts Grimmett, and Mrs. Traeger
at the organ.
The picnic was held as usual at the Botanic Gardens.
A beautiful day, happy fellowship with over 50 women
brought to a close another year of endeavour. It is a
regret that all our churches are not represented because
a union of our members is thereby missed.
The committee meetings have dealt with necessary
business that has found place in the larger meetings.


We have been represented at the Church of Christ,
Baptist Women’s League, Salvation Army, and Metho-
dist H.M. associations.
Hire of Cutlery. It was decided that in future no
special charge be made, but a donation relative to the
amount hired be asked.
Grateful thanks are due to all our women for their
loyalty and assistance, especially for the wonderful way
the interest has been kept in the H.M, socials in the
individual churches. Without these the central point
would be missed. The unity of the members of the
committee has made the other meetings possible and
successful, each doing her full share to whatever she
was assigned.
“Think happy thoughts! Think always of the best,”
that has been the keynote of our president (Mrs.
Watts Grimmett) in her association with every meeting
at which she has presided, and that spirit has been an
inspiration. Grateful thanks we give for her leader-
ship and friendship. The secretary appreciates the
help given to her to lighten the duties that had to be
undertaken. Together, as we face another year that
we know holds grave moments and difficulties, let us
put our faith in God to the test and remember —
“Courage to those is sent
That strive along life’s ways
To grapple with the present,
Thus moulding future days.”

WHITEFIELD’S MISSION, 1942 REPORT.
Whitefield’s Mission has placed on record another
year of service, and on behalf of the board of manage-
ment I have pleasure in presenting the sixteenth annual
report.
During the year under review the families on the
hooks of the mission have received considerable assist-
ance in clothing, footwear, furniture, vegetables, fruit,
and in the winter months coke and firewood, to say
nothing of friendly counsel and advice. What many
folk need more than money and material assistance, is to
know that someone is interested in them, in their des-
perate struggle for existence, and that there is someone
to w'hom the burdened heart can pour forth its sorrow.
Such things are among the fruits of the mission, that
cannot be embodied in annual reports. We can build
things but not influences; we can count heads but not
the aspirations of human hearts.
While it is not the policy of the mission to close
the door against any who are in need, special attention
has been given to the sick, the neglected women and
children, and the pensioners; their need is often the
most desperate; they are among the greatest sufferers in
that pathetic multitude — the economically disinherited.
On the spiritual side, the women's meetings on
Wednesday afternoons and the Friday morning church
services for the women of the mission have been a
feature of our work. We are indebted to the various
church guilds, and a host of speakers, w'ho have helped
the women greatly, with interesting programmes inclu-
sive of travel talks, entertainments, devotional addresses,
and afternoon tea. The value of the fellowship of
these weekly gatherings cannot be over-estimated and we
have reason to believe are far-reaching in their influence
upon the lives and homes of the people.
At the May meetings of the board of management,
we received the resignation of the chairman of the
board, Mr. Thompson Green, due to failing health.
Mr. Green was a foundation member of the board and
has served the mission in that capacity for 16 years,
and the board has placed on record its appreciation of
his services. We were fortunate in securing Mr. H. M.
Lushey, M.A., of the Rose Park church, to fill the
vacancy. He, with Messrs. A. M. Johnson, L. C. Knight,
and F. Salter as the new chairman, represent the
interests of the Board of the Parkin Mission and the
Union.
The annual button day street appeal was held under
the auspices of the charitable relief organizations on
Friday, August 10. Fourteen different organizations
participated in the effort and shared in the proceeds.
The appeal returned £793, and the amount allocated to
Whitefield’s was £57. The highest amount collected by
any single body of the Council was £120 16/4, and
was collected by our own mission. The effort was a
gain to the Council and our w-ork which cannot be
estimated simply in terms of money. It has strengthened
the bond of fellow-ship whach links the charities in a
common service. .
During the year goods in the form of clothing, etc.,
have been distributed amounting in value to £600. This
is a conservative estimate, but it serves to convey an
idea of the amount of work that has been done. The
financial year closed on September 30, the annual
statement of receipts and payments, together with the
balance sheet, w'as duly audited by the firm of Steele,
Calder, Austin & Slade, and is printed in the March issue
of the “Congregationalist.”
This report would be incomplete without fitting
acknowdedgment of the services rendered by the board
of management, the Whitefield’s women’s committee, the
voluntary workers, the honorary secretary and treasurer
(Miss Kathleen Grimmett, A.F.I.A.), the assistant
superintendent (Miss Gwen Hewett, L.Th.), and last
but not least, the churches. We express our thanks to
an ever-widening circle of friends and supporters, and
look to the future with hope and confidence.
H. WATTS GRIMMETT,
Superintendent.
HOSPITAL CHAPLAIN’S REPORT.
The hospital chaplaincy work has been somewhat dis-
organized during the second half of the year which is
covered by this report. The resignation of the Rev.
David Morgan from this office, after many years of
excellent service, meant that from the beginning of
August until practically the end of December there w'as
no consecutive visitation by a hospital chaplain. When-
ever he was free from his many other denominational
duties, the Rev. .las. E. Cresswell visited the patients
in the Adelaide Hospital and I wish to take this oppor-
tunity to thank him for his kindness and interest.
In order to ensure the maximum possible visitation,
I have enlisted the aid of the Rev. G. A. Cooper in
this work. The advantage of this is that often the
patients receive a visit from two different ministers
during the week and are able to offset the inexperience
of youth by means of the experience of age.
During my visits to the Adelaide Hospital I have
been particularly impressed by the gracious ministry
which is exercised there by certain women of our
denomination. Visits from the women of Stow church
and the Weir Memorial Sisterhood are greatly appre-
ciated'by the patients. I am sure that if other churches
were to adopt similar schemes for cheering the sick
folk, their endeavours would be richly blessed.

C.C.W.S. ANNUAL REPORT.
The C.C.W.S. is continuing to maintain its object, viz.,
“to co-ordinate and encourage the women’s work of the
denomination,’ and it realizes that this work extends
further than the walls of the Congregational Church.
Through the efforts of the Ladies’ Auxiliary to Home
Missions our women raised the largest sum of any one
denomination at a musical “at home” arranged in
August by the Women’s United Church Association;
through the effort", of the C.C.W.S. executive £23 was
raised towards the S.A. Alliance fair, and 77 shillings
towards the Lady Gowrie two million shilling fund.
In addition to this our women have made contributions
to many worthy causes of which we have no specific
record. Space does not permit an account of the
services of our representatives on many committees
and councils.
There have been several changes in the executive
during the year. It was with very deep regret that
we accepted the resignation of Mrs. Knauerhase. We
are most grateful for and appreciative of her efficient
and willing services as secretary.
In April we welcomed Mrs. Watts Grimmett, who
took Mrs, Grimwade’s place as president of the Ladies’
Auxiliary to Home Missions and Miss Sims’ place as
our Whitefields representatives; Mrs. Sykes, who suc-
ceeded Miss Burgess as L.M.S. secretary; Miss Burgess
who represents the United Women’s Praver Meeting
instead of the L.M.S.; Mrs. T. Rees Thomas, who
succeeded Mrs, Player on the National Council. Mrs.
Player resigned owing to impaired health. We thank
Mrs. Player for her faithful services.
On June 17 our annual all-day conference was held.
A detailed account of this appeared in the July issue
of the “Congrcgationalist.”
On April 16 at the half-yearly meeting Miss Mabel
Austin, Dip, Ed., gave an interesting address on “Women
and Public Questions.” A discussion followed, in
which Mrs. Lushey, Mrs. Kick, and Mrs. McRitchie
took part.
The annual meeting was held on September 23 at
Henley Beach when all the existing officers were
re-elected. At this meeting it was decided that “in
future the annual meeting of the C.C.W.S. be held to
coincide with the annua! meetings of the Congregational
Union.”
All present at this gathering must have been exceed-
ingly strengthened in mind and soul by the inspiring
address delivered by the Rev. Winifred Kiek, M.A.,
B.D., who spoke on “Unser Kampf.”
The executive has been discussing the question of .the
need for women to assist chaplains with their work in
the forces and decided to hold a conference on this
very important subject at the annual meeting on
April 15.
The secretary expresses her thanks to the executive
for their ready help and sympathy to her in her duties
and especially to Mrs. Kiek and Mrs. Ryan.
The executive is sincerely grateful to its president,
Mrs. Ryan, for the able way she has carried on her work
and the interest she has taken in the C.C.W.S. in spite
of her own illness and that of her family during the
year. “Yea, they are known, the hours of thine
endurance.’

CONGREGATIONAL MINISTERS’ PROVI-
DENT FUND OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA
(Incorporated).
Report for Year ended December 31, 1942.
Accounts are submitted herewith, duly audited.
Income received during 1942, available for use in
1943, is £764. 7/10, plus unexpended balance of gifts
£55 12/7. as against £855 6/4 last year.
Beneficiaries received for service pensions, ten men,
£427 13/2 supplemented by £32 1/9 from gifts. For
subsidies to policies, 13 men, £93 7/1. For emergency
grants £149 and bonus in March, 1942, £63 9/4.
The two members who retire this year are Messrs.
G. McEwin and F. E. Piper.
A report was made that the rate at which the fund
had been paying service pensions could not be main-
tained, and gifts were sought from churches and others
so that the reduction should not be as anticipated, 25
per cent. The response was £87 14/4 so that the rates of
pension were only reduced, by I2i per cent. Several
churches have decided to make periodical collections for
this purpose; and it is hoped that no further reduction
will have to be made.

The education committee comprises Ivir. G. McEwin,
president, the ministerial members of othe board, and
Mr. H. M. Lushey.
The governors met on 13 occasions during the year
and the education committee on six.
Bevan Memorial Lectures.
The Bevan Memorial Lectures were delivered from
July 17 to 22 by the Rev. J. Arthur Lewis, 8.A., of
Flinders Street Baptist Church. The theme was, “Chris-
tian Faith in a World at War.” They were of a high
standard and notably successful. The Right Rev. J. R.
Blanchard, 8.A., of Scots Church, was appointed lec-
turer for 1942. He has chosen as his theme, “Man’s
Distress and God’s Deliverance,” and the lectures will
be delivered from June 18 to 23.
College and Staff.
The valedictory service for 1941 was held on
November 25 when the Rev. A. G. G. C. Pentreath, M.A.,
delivered an address upon “The Sleeper Stirs.”
The inaugural meeting for 1942 was held on March 9
when the Rev. Principal P. C. W. Eckersley, 8.A.,
delivered an address upon “The Ministry of Crisis.”
The governors recognize and appreciate the services
rendered by Principal Kick and the Rev. A. H. Bell
and others also who have, in some cases, given single
lectures and in some cases short courses of lectures to
the students. They would again express their apprecia-
tion of the services rendered by Mrs. Kiek in super-
vising the domestic requirements of the college in these
very difficult times.
The Principal Reports.
In these times, when there is so much talk about the
growing shortage of ministers, it is pleasing to report
that Parkin College has this year sent forth no less
than eight men to serve in various parts of our State
and Commonwealth. John E. Shepherd, of Armadale,
W.A., honourably completely his extra-mural course
and was ordained at Kclmscott, W.A., on October 22,
1941; the service was associated with the half-yearly
meeting of the W.A. Union. He has since accepted a
hearty call to follow our former student, Rev. T. Rees
Thomas, 8.A., L.Th., at Subiaco, W.A. Douglas R.
Maschmedt, L.Th., of the Victor Harbour district
churches, was ordained at Brougham Place on Octo-
ber 30; he was trained here under the Parkin-Wesley
co-operative scheme. Leonard G. Kay, of Cheltenham,
after a long and strenuous course, was ordained at
Cheltenham on January 6, 1942; he has since removed
to Renmark, wffiere he takes the place of another
former student, the Rev. H. R. Ballard. Messrs.
Maschmedt and Kay have been granted the status of
intra-mural students, as they attended lectures here for
some years. Lawrence H. Dalziel, L.Th., senior student
in 1940, was ordained at Kilkenny on January 8; he has
settled at Ipswich, Queensland, where he is in charge
of our Booval, Blackstone, and Raceview churches,
under the supervision of the Rev. W. Clair Palmer,
L.Th., who was senior student here some 20 years ago.
Sydney M. Munn, 8.A., L.Th., senior student in 1941,
was ordained at Croydon on January 14; he accepted a
call to Roseville, Sydney, where he has made an excel-
lent beginning. Bert H, Parker was ordained on
January 29 at Highgate, to which church he has
accepted a call and where he is now happily engaged.
Wreford H. Trestrail, of Swan Reach, was ordained
on April 14; we w'ere able to hold this service at
Stow Memorial church as part of our own S.A. Union
annual assembly. Mr. Trestrail has shown admirable
zeal both as student and pastor. A. Rodney Mitchell,
L. formerly of this college but for some years in
the Methodist ministry, became minister of our Ken-
sington Gardens and Luhrs Road churches in July,
1941-
All these ordinations naturally left us with very few
students. Three intra-mural students were carried over
from 1941 to 1942. Ronald G. Wasley was elected senior
student; the others are Donald W. Bailey and Robert S.
McKenzie. We also carried over one extra-mural
student —B. J. Grewar (Point Pearce); ill-health has
very seriously delayed his progress. Three new proba-
tionary students were admitted in March, 1942
Edward J. Mathews (Colonel Light Gardens), Lorna
M. Stanfield (Memorial, Hobart), Norman Whiting
(Subiaco, W.A.). With only six students in residence,
our numbers are less than for many years, but, even so,
we are much better off than any of the other Congrega-
tional Colleges of Australia.
Examination results in 1942 were fair. L. G. Kay
secured two 2nd L.Th. subjects and qualified for his
certificate. L. H. Dalziel passed in Ist L.Th. Hebrew
and thus gained L.Th. and his certificate. He also
secured a B.A. subject and was extremely unfortunate
in not getting his degree. S. M. Munn passed four
2nd L.Th. subjects, gaining L.Th., and also the five
subjects required for Ist 8.D., with particular distinction
in Hebrew. He was awarded the college prize for the
third year in succession and will be remembered as one
of the ablest students we have ever had. W. R.
Trestrail passed in 2nd L.Th. theology, also in Congrega-
tional Church history and principles. A. R. Mitchell,
L.Th., passed in Congregational Church history and
principles. R. G. Wasley secured four subjects in Ist
L. D. W. Bailey secured another B.A. subject,
making six in all. R. S. McKenzie secured another
B.A. subject, making two in all.
We had a lay student in residence in 1941 —R. S.
Pearce (Maitland). He passed four B.Sc. subjects.
He has since joined the R.A.A.F.
The students had a great deal of preaching for our
own churches and also for churches of other denomina-
tions. Their work was much appreciated, but it is
questionable whether these strenuous week-ends are
conducive to a high standard of academic work, espe-
cially in the case of a junior student.
The Parkin-Wesley co-operative scheme continues to
function with mutual satisfaction. Thirteen Methodist
students and one Baptist student attended lectures in
1941 and many other students were helped unofficially.
Rev. A. H. Bell, M.A., 8.D., Rev. Principal P. C. W.
Eckersley, 8.A., and Rev. Principal-Emeritus F. Lade,
M. assisted me in the lecturing work. Miss Olive
Carter and Mr. F. L. Gratton took classes in voice
culture and musical appreciation respectively. Mr.
H. M. Lushey, M.A., Dip. Ed., delivered a very valuable
series of lectures on “Religious Education,” which
attracted large audiences; this course took place at
Pirie Street Methodist Church and was open to all
who cared to come.
In April, 1941, in connection with the Congregational
Union Assembly, we inaugurated a “college commemora-
tion,” at which Rev. Principal Emeritus F. Lade, M.A.,
spoke. In April, 1942, the experiment was repeated;
Rev. R. E. Sutton, M.A., Warden of St. Barnabas’
College, gave the address.


The 21st anniversary of the principal’s settlement
here W'as celebrated in May last. The principal is
grateful for tokens of regard alike from the governors
and from past and present students of the college.
Domestic administration has entailed special anxieties.
Mrs. Kiek has assumed new' and exacting responsibilities
arising from shortage of staff.
Finance.
For the year under review the amount of £2,024 4/4
w as expended upon the objects of the trust but amounts
totalling £174 16/6 were received as a set-off, leaving
a net expenditure of £1,849 7/10. The net revenue for
the year amounted to £2,108 10/3 and after providing
the necessary reserve an amount of £2,003 1/9 is
available for college purposes for the year ending
March 31, 1943.

THE CONGREGATIONAL CHAPEL BUILD-
ING SOCIETY OF S.A. INCORPORATED.
Report for Year ended March 31, 1942.
The members of the society are Messrs, R. K. Wood
(chairman), F, W. Hancock (treasurer), H. I*. Harris,
A. M. Johnson, H. H. Cowell, W. E. Sara, and
A. V. Adamson.
Nine meetings of the society were held.
During the year advances amounting to £480 were
made to Port Elliot for the building of a school hall,
and £775 was lent to Manthorpe Memorial to pay off
a loan upon their manse, and £50 was re-advanced to
Croydon.
Repayments of principal during the year amounted to
£1,963 7/11, including proceeds from the sales of the
Kadina church and hall and of the Port
manse. Unfortunately, the sales of the Kadina and
Port Noarlunga properties resulted in a loss of capital
of £355 3/8.
Interest received amounted to £211 5/-.
Working expenses amounted to £100 17/-, leaving a
net amount of £110 8/- for transfer to capital account.
We are pleased to be able to report that with three
exceptions, the churches are meeting their obligations
under the new arrangement concerning interest and
repayments.
Under the new National Security Regulations relat-
ing to restrictions on building together with the very
high costs and increased sales tax, it is not expected
that we shall be receiving applications for new struc-
tures and the operations of the society will be mostly
confined to easing the burden of those churches who
have loans outside of the Chape! Building Society and
paying higher rates of interest.

ANNUAL REPORT OF C.Y.C. EXECUTIVE.
At the last annua! meeting, it was decided to hold
the usual meeting of the Council during the Union
meetings, hence we have to report only upon six months’
activity. Some of this time has been spent constituting
the Council and organizing its work, and the Christmas
vacation further reduced the time available.
Mention should be made of the loss of Mr. L. R.
Berry, one of the most active and informed members
of the executive. He has been called up for service
with the R.A.A.F, We wish him every success in his
work and hope for his early return.
We are glad to report too per cent, successes in the
examination held in psychology and teacher training
for the diploma of the Normal College, Melbourne.
Several of our candidates gained honours and credits.
The course to be continued this year, when we hope for
good attendance. It will be on the study of the Bible
and Christian Evidences. Alternating with this course
the Council will conduct, through the C.Y.F., a series
of classes on Lay Preaching and the Conduct of Wor-
ship. We hope for an increased attendance at these
courses.
Rev. C. Denis Ryan, B.A., A.I.C.A., A.A.I.S.
Minister of Brougham Place Church, President of the
L.M.S, (S.A. Auxiliary), Chairman-Elect of the Congre
gational Union and Home Mission.
Our financial statement will show that we were able
to finish our financial year without increasing our over-
draft, which is a legacy handed down from the past.
However, we were not able to make any contribution
to home missions. This year the Council starts its new
scheme of finance, by w'hich schools are asked to send
half their income to be divided equally between home
missions, L.M.S., and the work of the Council. Natur-
ally, schools cannot be compelled to adopt this method,
but we suggest it as an effective way of apportioning
finance.
Little has been done since the last report except that
three lesson helps have been published on “Salvation
and the Junior Child,” These are of special interest to
us because they were compiled by Mr. L. R. Berry,
The studies are of great value. There were several


conferences conducted by the C.R.E. at which members
of our executive took leading parts.
The C.Y.F. ran a successful concert at Christmas
time, to clear £40 profit. This enabled it to start the
year in a sound financial position. It has planned con-
siderable activity for the coming year, including an
Easter conference at Seacliff.
At a combined meeting of the executives of the
C.Y.C. and C.Y.F., it was decided to recommend the
nomination of the Rev. K. B. Leaver to the office
of Director during the coming year, but it was decided
to raise the whole question of the directorate at the next
annual meeting.
We congratulate and pledge our support to Mr. Eric
Taylor as he takes the office of the Chairman of the
Llnion. He has served us faithfully as treasurer for
many years. We have every confidence in him and
ask God’s blessing upon his work.
The officers of the Council have given devoted service
to the work of yonth during the past year. The thanks
of the denomination are due to these men, who are
untiring in their efforts to help young people.
On behalf of the executive,
K. B. LEAVER,
Director.
Addendum.
We record our appreciation for the unremitting zeal
with which our Director, the Rev. K. B. Leaver, has
applied himself to his task during the six months that
is past. We welcome the freeing of the week-ends,
which will enable him to come into direct touch with
all our constituency, both in the country and in the city.
On behalf of the executive,
C. DENIS RYAN,
Chairman.
ANNUAL REPORT OF C.Y.F. EXECUTIVE.
The executive was constituted under the chairmanship
of the Rev. T. Rees Thomas. After the resignation of
the Rev. L. H. Cocks as Yonth Adviser, the Rev. K. B.
Leaver was appointed Youth Director, in conjunction
with the directorate of the C.Y.C. The C.Y.F. agreed to
pay £75 p.a. of the £125 that the Director receives for
this work. It was with regret that we received the
resignations of Miss Lorna Stanfield and Mr. Don
Bailey during the year, and more recently of Mr. Peter
Mathews. The executive expressed its appreciation for
the devoted work of Mr. Mathews, who has been large!}'
responsible for the re-formation of the C.Y.F.
Early in the year the executive decided to raise moncy
for the production of a colour film on aboriginal work
in Australia. Although about £25 was raised for this
purpose, it was found necessary to abandon the project.
The money has been returned to the givers.
Investigation was also made about a projector for Dr.
Bowering. This could not be bought because of the war,
but we still hold the money in trust for this purpose.
This year rallies have been varied in type and atten-
dance. There have been devotional, social, and educa-
tional evenings, and all have been of a high standard.
However, as rallies bring in a considerable part of our
income, as well as for their spiritual value, we hope
for an increased attendance.
No residential Easter conference was held last year,
though a one-day conference was held at Mount Lofty
on Good Friday, with an attendance of about 30. We
are glad to report that arrangements have been made
for a four-day conference at Easter time this year at
the “Astoria,” Seacliff.
Responsibility for the rental of the Director’s office
and the clubroom was assumed by the Union and the
C.Y.C. early in the year, though the Fellowship is still
willing to help with the payment. The L.M.S. Auxiliary
now bouses its literature department in this room.
During the year the constitution was amended to fit
the work of the reorganized Fellowship. This provides
for adequate finance and rectifies some anomalies. We
hope that it will serve the needs of the groups.
Month by month studies have been issued to the
groups. These have been widely used and most groups
have found them satisfactory. Where there has been
criticism, the executive has tried to meet it. But we
are looking for some book which will cover the period
of our studies and give more guidance than the limited
space at the disposal of the committee will permit.
Miss Kathleen Grimmett has raised from the C.Y.F.
and other sources about £6O for our aboriginal mission
at Point McLeay. The C.Y.F. is very conscious of its
responsibility in this, and is looking forward to doing
a useful work.
Although this work has often been brought to our
attention, very little practical instruction has been carried
on for some time. In the coming year we have decided
to provide instruction on Friday evenings, alternating
with the C.Y.C. class in Bible study.
We co-operate, as far as possible, with other denomi-
national and interdenominational bodies. The L.M.S.
has provided us with an excellent leader and speaker
in Miss Kathleen Scott, who helped us during her visit
here. We are looking forward to having Mr. Baguley,
from China, at our Easter conference. We are repre-
sented on the Legion of Christian Youth, and are
closely in contact with their work. We commend their
speakers, films, and other educational work to the various
fellowships.
A communion plate was sent as a gift to Chaplain
Ballard, but unfortunately it did not arrive. Enquiries
are being made.
At the close of the year a concert was held in the
Adelaide Town Hall. Despite great difficulties about
£4O was gained for the funds of the Fellowship. This,
with the money from the ugly man competition (whose
£24 was equally divided between our funds and the
L.M.S.), enabled us to balance our budget and start the
year on a satisfactory financial basis.
Thanks are due to the officers; Mr. Thomas as chair-
man, Miss Grimmett as treasurer: and special mention
should be made of the fine and consistent work of
Miss Berry, who has compiled the records of the
fellowship and acted as collator for our section of the
“Congregationalist.”
On behalf of the executive,
K. B. LEAVER,
Director.
In view of paper restrictions and the need of conserv-
ing stock, it is impossible to reproduce all annual
reports. Those not included are to be found in the
March and April “Congregationalist” of the current
year.


Our Pioneer Home missionaries
The First Congregational Church of South Australia, 1837.
It is ever interesting, in view of the splendid service
rendered by the Rev. T. Quinton Stow in founding the
Congregational Church in South Australia, to recall the
beginning of his work and its marvellous growth under
his direction. He was a worthy forerunner of the many
hundreds who have built up the churches of our Home-
land.
The Rev. F. W. Cox has portrayed our first Home
Missionary thus:
Rev. T. Quinton Stow.
"He possessed indomitable energy, inflexible strength
of will, and an integrity that commanded the respect of
all classes of the community. He had a sense of public
duty so clear and strong that he engaged in every public
matter that had a bearing upon chat 'righteousness that
exalteth a nation.” And wherever the action
of the 'powers that be’ was likely to entrench
upon the rights of conscience or the liberty
of the individual, Mr. Stow was always in the
forefront. No man came to the conflict
more readily, or stood his ground more
firmly, or gave a reason for his opinion and
action with more convincing power than
Thomas Q. Stow.”
Rev. D. Milne.
The Rev. David. Milne was the pioneer of the South-
East. His name is familiar even to-day from Murray
Bridge to the Victorian border. Before the railway
connected the States he drove his horses through the
"ninety-mile desert,” now known as the "Border Downs,”
bringing to many a lonely settler there a sense of friend-
ship and a knowledge of the Master Mr Milne so much
loved. "His diocese,” says the Rev. F. W. Cox, "was a
vast one, extending in some directions sixty to eighty miles
from the centre.” In later years he settled at Border-
town, a town he had been in the habit of visiting
during his pastoral work years before he settled
there. The work of the Rev. Thomas Quinton
Stow and that of the Rev. David Milne is typical
of much zealous service rendered to day. Many ministers
of Home Mission Churches and of the Parkin Mission
are, with unflagging zeal, carrying on similar work,
It is not spectacular; it is often carried on under most
trying conditions, both with regard to weather and
circumstance. But the value of the work its signifi-
cance —is to be understood in the wonderful fruitage
that has followed that of the two typical Home Mis-
sionaries to whom the foregoing has reference.
The Home Mission Board asks your personal interest
and financial assistance, that it may sustain and enlarge
this wondrous field of service.


T "'
dl
c % from the dJfome emission Secretary
Hr
ihrcn,
'there is arising in our churches a keener interest in the Home Mission l : iclil. This
only in the financial aid rendered, but in the Ihoitghtf ul “gifts in hind” lo the Mission centre
Point MeLeav. and
is manifested not
of “li'hilcfields,”
Halifax Street.
Then, 100, one hears from tune to lime of your personal meeting with those to whom
the missions minister. 7 his is one of the most conclusive evidences erj fraternal regard.
The recent visit lo the office of two most active markers at Halifax Street Mission
revealed the activity that prevails at this centre. The Mothers' Club there has a member-
ship of about eighty and an average attendance of sixty. Many visits are paid meekly
lo sick and indigent folk unable to attend the meetings. The children share in the
regard of Halifax Street ■markers, and in that of the Sunday s. hool officers and teachers.
H children's forty during every vacation is a much valued and happy function.
The constant gifts of clothing, vegetables. and fruit enable the Mission to minister
lo many needy ones. It is simitar great-hearted service that characterises the ■mark of
"U'hitcfields” and Taint MeLcay.
II 'ill you remember that “gifts in kind” or donations may be left at Ike Hnwn Office?
Tour Home Mission Field, hermever. also inehid.es the sneaker churches. The draft upon the Home Mission
Tunds each quarter groves heavier and, although the response to the "T'enny-per-soeek" Scheme is excellent, vet
the work involves continual strain lo meet all claims. IPe ask your ever enlarging interest and generous sup-
port. IVdl you. my reader friend, help us to obtain the objective that ■mill make possible a very real advance.
The Home MHsion .Hoard, to make ils work effective, needs a yearly income of at leas! fi.ooa

Parkin Congregational Mission
Point McLeay Aboriginal Station
This paragraph is displayed in the church porch. It
was copied from an ancient English entrance porch.
"This is God’s House, so as you look around
Do not forget you are on Holy ground;
Without a prayer, Oh, do not leave this place,
But for yourself ask Pardon, Blessing, Grace;
For those who minister and worship here,
Ask help as well, and strength to persevere.
Think over all that God has done for you,
And give Him hearty thanks, as is His due.”
Mr, Jas. Unaipon
One of the First Aborigine Missionaries
THE POINT McLEAY CONGREGATIONAL
MISSION TO THE NATIVE RACE.
The settlement of Point McLeay was first called and
known as Reid Town, in memory of Rev. J. Reid, first
missionary to the Lakes drowned 1863.
Copied from an Old Minute Book Kept at the Station.
(Minutes written by Rev. Geo. Taplin,
Congregational Missioner.)
Reid Town, Point McLeay, January 1 5 1870. This
church has now been in existence since January 2, 1866
with seven members it commenced. Since then thirty-
two members have united with us. (Here follow names
of first membership.)
First Diaconate, May 3, 1871. The pastor requested
the church to choose one of the aboriginal members to
be a deacon. John Sumner moved and William
McHughcs (natives) seconded that James Unaipon
should be a deacon of this church. This was carried
unanimously. (Mr. J. A, Ophel, schoolmaster, was
the first white deacon and James Unaipon was the first
native deacon.) James Unaipon was inducted to the
office of deacon at the meeting, May 31, 1871.
Church Meeting, May 12 1888. At this meeting the
question of enlarging the chapel was brought forward
and a building committee appointed.
Church Meeting, July 7, 1888. Reports of progress
made for the enlargement of the chapel, nearly £5O in
goods and material are given. The Biblical motto,
"Charity toward each other aboundeth,” is expressed in
many kindly deeds by the natives.
Children’s Hospital. Yearly appeal to our people is
made on behalf of this worthy institution; so far this
year £3 has been raised.
Local Red Cross. President, Mrs. Lawrie; treasurer,
Mrs. Payne. Exceptionally fine efforts have been made
toward this great work. Since its inception here,
October 31, 1939, £l5! has been raised.
School Patriotic Fund, under the able direction of the
head teacher, Mr. W. T. Lawrie. With patriotic zeal the
school children have subscribed their pence, the total
raised being £l6l.
Kindergarten Hall. This is a great need. Names
on the roll, 100. With a desire toward self-help £145
has been raised; of this amount the young people of
the C.Y.F. have generously donated £6B. For this timely
assistance we return hearty thanks.
In addition to all the above our people subscribe liber-
ally to Congregational Home Mission Funds, as well as
giving financial aid toward the upkeep of the Mission.
Point McLeay Church.
Pastor H. E. Read writes as follows;
Although it is now sixty-four years since Rev. G.
Taplin, the first missionary, was called to rest from his
labours, "he being dead yet liveth.” His name is
venerated by the natives to this day. The late Mark
Wilson, a well-informed aboriginal and leader, educated
at Point McLeay, has left the following testimony; "I can
recall the Rev. G. TapliiTs magnetic personality and his
burning zeal for the salvation of the native race.
Experience has shown chat the Christian faith is the most
powerful influence changing the life of the tribes and
has proved also that without touching the heart of the
race there can be no real advance,”
Although this testimony of Wilson’s was one of his
last messages and printed five years ago, yet it is quite
up to date and bears the stamp of the present in that,
as Wilson says, the Christian faith is the most powerful
influence. We still preach Christ crucified, and we work
to bring the native people to Him, that, as Christians, they
may take their place as citizens of the Commonwealth.
