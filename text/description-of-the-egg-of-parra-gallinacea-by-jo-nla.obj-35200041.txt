Description of the Egg of Parra gallinacea.
By John Gould, F.R.S. &c.
The ground-colour of the egg of this species is of a dark shining
raw-sienna tint, over which are traced in various directions a series
of broad and fine hair-like contorted lines of brownish black, which,
by occasionally uniting laterally and crossing each other, form here
and there large blotches. Although these markings are of the same
character on each egg, they are somewhat differently distributed :
thus, on one of the two I possess, they are more numerous at the
larger end, and absent at the smaller; while, on the other, they are
more abundant at the smaller, and less so at the larger extremity.
The eggs are one inch and an eighth in length by seven eighths of an
inch in breadth. They are, moreover, rendered remarkably conspi-
cuous by the singularly pointed form of the smaller end, and by their
small size as compared with that of the bird, but above all by the
form and disposition of the markings, which are as if traced by the
hand of a person who had amused himself by attempting to cover the
surface with fantastic streaks, blotches, and contorted curves from
end to end.
The two examples above described were most kindly sent to me
from Eastern Australia, by Mr. Hills, through the instrumentality of
his relative, Sir Daniel Cooper, Bart.
