PROSPECTUS.
IN the establishment of a Bank of Issue and Deposit under
the above Title, the Directors are chiefly impressed with a
conviction of the importance of meeting the increased demand
for Capital in the Australasian Colonies, and are desirous in
the establishment of their Banks in New South Wales, Van
Diemen's Land, and other Australasian Settlements, to
identify, to the utmost of their power, the interests of the
Colonists with their own.
The Directors are fully persuaded that in no part of the
world can capital be more advantageously or securely
employed than in Australasia, where the Bank Interest is 8
per Cent, and the current rate considerably higher; and
where the Dividends of the Colonial Banks have hitherto
averaged fully 15 per Cent, per Annum.
An important advantage in the present undertaking is the
junction of one of the most profitable Banks in the Colonies
with this establishment; which measure, it is expected, will
be followed by the coalition of others at the principal stations.
A local currency, based upon a capital affording unques-
tionable security, is much wanted, and loudly called for; and
the facilities which this establishment will afford for trans-
mitting, in safety, the funds of emigrants and others to the
Colonies and of making remittances to Europe, will be great
and highly appreciated.


In order to facilitate the junction with some of the existing
Banks, Ten Thousand Shares are reserved for appropriation
in the Colonies, the Directors retaining the power of issuing
in England, at such premium as they shall see fit, whatever
part of these Shares may not be required for that purpose.
The Deed of Settlement contains a clause, giving power
to dissolve the Company, in the event of one-fourth of the
subscribed capital being at any time lost; and it will be
imperative on the Board of Directors to call a meeting of the
Proprietors to consider such dissolution, if any such loss shall
arise.
The Directors will negotiate approved Bills on the Colo-
nies, and, on the Deposit of Monies, grant Letters of Credit
and Drafts on the Branches, at 30 days' sight, at such charge
as they may from time to time deem expedient. Bills will
also be forwarded for collection, and the proceeds remitted
to England, at a Commission of £2 per Cent.
REGULATIONS.
1. The affairs of the Company will be managed by the
Board of Directors in London, assisted by local Directors
in the Colonies, who will act under the control of the
London Board.
2. The present London Directors to remain in office until
the annual meeting in June, 1839, when two of them shall

and, in like manner, two Directors to go out of office
annually; in all cases, the Directors retiring to be eligible
for re-election.


3. The General Meetings of the Proprietors to take place

the first meeting to be held in June, 1839.
4. Special General Meetings of the Proprietors to be
convened by the Directors, on giving fourteen days' notice
thereof in the London Gazette and one or more daily papers,

Proprietors, holding in the aggregate one thousand Shares
or upwards; such requisition stating the object of the meeting
and being left at the office of the Company at least twenty-
one days before the proposed day of meeting.
5. The capital to be paid up as follows:—£s per Share at
the time of subscribing, and the remainder as the Directors

months, of which twenty-one days' notice shall be given by
Circulars to the Proprietors, and Advertisements in one or
more daily papers.
6. No .person shall be eligible as a Director in London
holding a less number of Shares than Forty, nor as a Local
Director holding a less number than Twenty.
7. At all meetings of the Proprietors, each person holding
eight Shares will be entitled to one vote; sixteen Shares
two votes; thirty-two Shares three votes; eighty and upwards
four votes ; and no Proprietor to have a greater number of
votes than four.
8. No Proprietor to be qualified to vote in respect of any
Shares on which all calls shall not have been paid.
9. At Special General Meetings the business to be confined


to the specific object set forth in the advertisements con-

beyond the day appointed for such call being paid, the Shares

Board of Directors for the time being, and to be, by them,
disposed of for the benefit of the Company, or at their option
to be subject to the charge of interest at the rate of £5 per
cent, per annum.
11. The capital of the Company may be enlarged to any
amount not exceeding, in the total, One Million, with the
assent of two-thirds (in value) of the Proprietors present at
a Special General Meeting to be convened for that purpose,
and the holders of the existing shares to have the option of
taking all or any new shares before they are offered to the
public.
12. The Directors to have power to make such allowances
and compensation for services, and generally to appoint such
Agents, and pay such salaries as they shall, from time to
time, deem proper, and incur and pay such other necessary
expenses in managing the affairs of the Company as they
may find requisite.
13. The Directors to have the power to make by-laws
for the management of the affairs of the Company, subject
to their being rescinded or altered at any Special General
Meeting called for that purpose.

writing on either side ; provided such notices be given and
expire before an equivalent call be made on the general body
of Proprietors.
15. The Directors to have power (until the first general
Meeting of Proprietors) to add to the Board of Directors
such names as they may think expedient for the interests of
the Company, not exceeding twelve in the whole.

shall be annually retained as a reserved fund, until the same
shall amount to £200,000

FIRST REPORT
OF THE
DIRECTORS
OF THE
UNION BANK OF AUSTRALIA,
PRESENTED AT
THE GENERAL MEETING
OF THE
PROPRIETORS,
HELD THE 26th OF JUNE, 1839.
In submitting the Report of the proceedings of this Bank,
from its commencement to the present period, the Direc-
tors congratulate the Proprietors on the success which has
attended the Bank hitherto, and the encouraging prospects
they feel authorized to hold out with respect to the future.
The favourable light in which the Union Bank was viewed
by the public is evident from the fact, that the whole of the
Shares were taken as soon as issued, without having been
offered for sale by advertisement, and the Deposits and In-
stalments paid up without any default.
The junction with the Tamar Bank, at Launceston, Van
Diemen's Land, anticipated in the Prospectus, was effected
in a very satisfactory manner. The Tamar Bank dissolved
itself on the 30th of April of last year, and on the follow-
ing day, the Branch of the Union Bank at Launceston,
commenced its operations. The Shares of the Bank were
freely taken, and nearly one thousand of those appropriated
for that locality were disposed of in a short space of time;


the original Proprietors, with very few exceptions, became
Shareholders in this Bank, and a highly respectable Local
Board of Directors was appointed, subject to the approval
of the Board of Directors in London, and consisting chiefly
of those of the previous Tamar Bank.
The intelligence subsequently received, of the progress
of this Branch, has been very satisfactory, and fully justifies
the expectations of the Board concerning the utility of the
measure.
A Sub-branch has also been formed at Campbell Town, a
thriving township, about forty miles from Launceston, situate
in the centre of a rich agricultural district. This measure
was adopted at the unanimous recommendation of the Laun -
ceston Board, under whose entire control it is placed, and
has given much satisfaction to the principal settlers in the
neighbourhood.
In the appointment of a Colonial Inspector, the Directors
consider themselves fortunate in having secured the services
of Mr. John Cunningham Mac Laren, a gentleman who,
from his extensive experience in banking business, derived
during his connection with the Provincial Bank of Ireland,
and other banking establishments, was peculiarly qualified for
such an office, and whose subsequent conduct has fully
justified the selection.
A Branch Bank has been likewise opened at Hobart
Town, which began business on the 6th of September last,
and the progress of which, up to the date of the latest advices,
has afforded much satisfaction.
The rising Colony of Port Philip, situate on the south-
eastern coast of Australia, presented a promising station
for the establishment of a Branch Bank at Melbourne.
The necessary steps for this purpose were therefore taken,


and the Officers appointed. The Directors arfc already in
receipt of accounts from this Branch of a very satisfactory
nature, and they have no doubt that it will prosper in a de-
gree corresponding with the rapid advances made by this
thriving Colony.
The increasing importance, in a commercial point of view,
of Sydney, the capital of New South Wales, naturally in-
duced the Directors to decide upon the establishment of
a Bank in that place without delay. It has not been found
practicable, as yet, to form a junction with any of the exist-
ing Banks. The Inspector has, therefore, organized a Bank
under his own superintendence, and selected a Local Board
of Directors, which he has effected to the entire satisfaction
of this Board. The extent of business transacted at Sydney
is very great, and the public attention seems to have been
much directed to our new Establishment. Applications had
been made, up to the Ist of January, for upwards of four
thousand Shares; and on the 2nd of that month, the
Bank commenced business with very favourable prospects.
The Directors have'received, during the present month,
advices from the Inspector, dated 12th of January last, in
which he states, that, in his opinion, not more than 7,000
Shares will be required for the Colonies, of which 5,635
have been already applied for. They have, therefore, ordered
the distribution of the remaining 3,000 Shares, originally re-
served for the Colonies, amongst the Proprietors in this
country, charged with the interest on the instalments already
called, to equalize the payments with the former issues.
The Directors regard it as a strong proof of the estimation
in which the Bank is held, that such a proportion of the
Shares should have been applied for in the Colonies, where
a very high rate of interest can be obtained on the invest-


ment of money; and particularly as it has been stipulated,
that the Shares are not to be transferred to this country;
and they feel that they cannot place too great a value upon
the influence of the large body of Local Proprietors, who
have thus identified themselves with the interests of the Bank
in the seat of its operations.
No attempt has been made to establish a Branch at
Adelaide—this Bank standing in the most friendly relations
towards the South Australian Company, whose Bank in that
settlement has undertaken to act as our Agent, whilst the busi-
ness of that Company is transacted with all our other Branches.
The Directors have been much pleased to observe that
their Inspector, in all his proceedings in the Colonies, has
given full effect to their wishes and instructions, by cultiva-
ting a friendly feeling and cordial co-operation with the other
existing establishments ; and has obtained for this Bank the
confidence of the Colonial authorities, as well as of the lead-
ing Commercial Houses in Australia; and they are peculiarly
gratified at the selection he has made of Local Directors.
The Directors feel bound to express, in this first Report
of their proceedings, the deep obligations this Bank is under
to PHILIP OAKDEN, Esq. through whom the proposition of
a junction with the Tamar Bank at Launceston was received.
Mr. OAKDEN vacated his seat at this Board on leaving England
for Launceston, in November, 1837, and has, since his
arrival there, become one of our Local Directors. He has
gratuitously rendered the most important services in the
establishment of the Branches, and his advice and assistance
have proved of great value to the Inspector.
By the death of the late JAMES NORRIS, Esq. the Bank
has been deprived of the services of a Director, whose zeal
in promoting its interests was only equalled by the judgment,

prudence, and discretion which he applied to its affairs. His
brother Directors, although many of them had but a short
official acquaintance with him, felt his loss as that of a valued
friend and colleague.
The Directors have sent out orders for the accounts of the
several Branch Banks to be balanced half-yearly, so as to
enable them to declare Dividends at Christmas and Midsum-
mer, The returns to these orders have not yet been received,
except from the Launceston Branch. The Directors are
not, therefore, in a position to lay before the Proprietors at
present, such a statement of accounts as would warrant them
in declaring a Dividend, but they propose to call a Special
Meeting for that purpose.
From the Documents in their possession, they are, how-
ever enabled to give the following statement of the affairs o
Nett Profit to 31st December, 1838 £4,711 17 0
In conclusion, the Directors feel it incumbent upon them
to state, for the satisfaction of the Proprietors, that no loss
has been sustained by the Bank, either in London or the
Colonies, and that their measures have been attended with
a success which has answered every reasonable expectation.
GEORGE FIFE ANGAS,
CHAIRMAN.


AT the First General Meeting of the PROPRIETORS, held
at the Offices of the Bank, No. 38, Old Broad Street, on
Wednesday, the 26th of June, 1839, pursuant to the Pro-
visions of the Deed of Settlement,
GEORGE FIFE ANGAS, ESQ. IN THE CHAIR,
IT WAS UNANIMOUSLY RESOLVED.
That the Report now read be adopted, and printed for the
use of the Proprietors.
A Ballot was held to fill up the vacancy occasioned by the
retirement of two of the Directors, when, upon a scrutiny, it
appeared that ROBERT BROOKS, Esq. and JAMES RUDDELL
TODD, Esq. were unanimously re-elected.
RESOLVED UNANIMOUSLY,
That the thanks of this Meeting be presented to the Chair-
man and the other Directors, for their assiduous attention to
the interests of the Bank.
Extracted from the Minutes,
SAMUEL JACKSON, Secretary.


SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT
OF THE
DIRECTORS
OF THE
UNION BANK OF AUSTRALIA,
PRESENTED AT THE
SPECIAL GENERAL MEETING
OF THE
PROPRIETORS.
HELD ON THE 3RD FEBRUARY, 1840.
The First Annual Report of this Bank, presented in the
month of June last, concluded with the following paragraph,
" The Directors have sent out orders for the accounts of the
several Branch Banks to be balanced half yearly, so as to
enable them to declare Dividends at Christmas and Mid-
summer; the returns to these orders have not yet been
received, except from the Launceston Branch. The
Directors are not, therefore, in a position to lay before the
Proprietors, at present, such a statement of accounts as
would warrant them in declaring a Dividend; but they
propose to call a special meeting for that purpose."
Complete returns having been received from all the
Branches, down to the 30th June last, the Directors now
find themselves enabled to redeem their pledge.


They consider, however, that the present Special Meeting
affords them a suitable opportunity of expressing their
entire satisfaction at the progress which the Bank has made.
Their anticipations have been more than realized, and it has
been peculiarly gratifying to them to observe, that all the
negociations and arrangements entered into, both in the
union with the Tamar Bank, at Launceston, and the estab-
lishment of Branch Banks at Sydney, Hobart Town, Port
Philip, and Campbell Town, have been characterised by a
good feeling, and a cordial and zealous co-operation for the
Bank's interests, which have given the fullest effect to the
wishes and intentions of the Board, and reflect great credit
upon the judgment and discretion of the gentlemen who
have undertaken the important office of Local Directors,
and of the Inspector, J. C. M'LAREN, Esq.
Under such favourable circumstances, it is not too much
to expect that a system of banking, matured and eminently
successful at home, should steadily advance, at all the
Branches of the " Union Bank of Australia," to a very high
degree of prosperity.
Of the 5635 Shares, stated in the Report to have been
applied for in the Colonies, 5502 have been taken and paid
for at the respective branches. 7000 were then stated to
have been reserved for the Colonies; the remaining 1498
have consequently been returned to this country, and a
distribution made on the principle before adopted amongst
the Proprietors at home of one in ten, the nearest proportion
at which the Directors could arrive: 293 Shares, being the
indivisable overplus, have been sold for the benefit of the

Company; no part of the premium on which is brought
into the present account of profit. The entire 20,000
Shares, forming the Capital of the Bank, are now appro-
priated.
The Directors will not further anticipate the more
detailed Report which it will be their duty to present at the
next Annual Meeting, but proceed to submit a statement
of the Bank's affairs, only premising that these accounts
exhibit the working of the branches for the six months
ending 30th June, and of the London Office for the year
ending 31st December, 1839. This has been determined
upon, in order to afford to the large body of Colonial Pro-
prietors the latest possible information as to the state of
their affairs, and that all Dividends should be regulated by
the actual amount of the Bank's profits, as they stand in
London, at the period of making the same.

The result of this account enables the Directors to declare
a Dividend for the Half Year, ending 31st December last,
of Fourteen Shillings per Share on all the Shares of this
Bank, on those held at home on the 10th instant, and in
the Colonies as soon as can be arranged bv the Inspector,
after the receipt of advices.
The Deed of Settlement provides that one-tenth part of
the total profits should be appropriated as a reserve fund,
until the same amount to £200,000, as follows :
Nett profit to 31st Dec.
1838, as above £ 4,711 17 0
