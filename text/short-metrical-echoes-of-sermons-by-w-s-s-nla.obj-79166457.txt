THE ROD WHICH BUDDED.
Numbers xvi. 8.
O Righteous Branch, the Christ of God !
Better than Aaron?s budding rod,
We hail in Thee th? appointed Sign
Of Hope, and Life, and Fruit divine.
Humbled to death and stripp?d of all
Life?s beauty, Thou dids?t seem to fall
A barren branch, a sever?d rod?
Yet in Thee work?d the Life of God.
And in the morn we look?d ; and lo !
Thro? the stripp?d rod there hastes to flow
The vital sap ; come buds, and bloom,
And fruit that still wants wider room.
0 Risen Man ! 0 Living Lord !
O Chosen Priest ! Be Thou ador?d !
We hail in THEE the appointed sign
Of Hope, and Life, and Fruit divine.

THE SAFE SANCTUARY,
Psalm iv. 6.
Many visions round me mingle, as I tread my way in life,
Till my being seems to tingle with the discord, and the strife,
Some are mournful, some are scornful ;
But they still reiterate one cry,?
? Who can help us? All is vanity.?
Countless sins and sorrows grieve us ; seems no end to forms of ill;
Fade our joys, our hopes deceive us ; small our strength is, faint our will
Friend and foeman, man and woman,
Sadly still reiterate the cry,?
? Who can help us ? All is vanity.?
Truth seems hard beset by error, Righteousness to lose its ground ;
Oftentimes mysterious terror spreads a nameless gloom around,
Painful losses, bitter crosses,
Still are tempting men to swell the cry,?
? Who can help us ? All is vanity .?
Lord, I turn to Thy sure promise; Lord, I trust Thy wondrous love,
Thou cans?t keep all real harm from us ; beam Thou on me from above;
Thou defendest, light Thou sendest;
Let me, praying, forthwith find in Thee
Help, and comfort, and security.
Many taunting voices reach me, as I wander on my way.
Guide and Saviour, do Thou teach me, what to think, and do, and say ;
Still relying, e?en when dying,
On the gracious help I find in Thee,
Constant comfort and security.
When I tempted am to waver, when my heart scant courage hath,
Lift the light of Thy dear favour on Thy trembling servant?s path,
0 be near me to assure me,
That, at all times, I may find in Thee
Help, and comfort, and security.
Then tho? many ask the question, ? who will show us any good 1 ?
This shall quell each doubt?s suggestion, banish ev?ry faithless mood;
? Jesus loves me, God approves me,
Still in Him, as earthly years pass by,
Find I comfort, help, security.'

PRAYER FOR GUIDANCE.
Psalm, xvii. 5.
? Thy paths,? O Lord, I seek,
Wherever I may go;
I?m poor and ignorant, and weak \
Thy gracious guidance, Lord, bestow.
? Thy paths ? and not my own,
Are those that I would choose ;
Dear Lord, I cannot walk alone,
Thy helping Hand do not refuse.
? Thy paths ? I seek; oh ! set
My footsteps in Thy way;
Then keep me safe, O Lord, nor let
My heart in wilful wanderings stray.
? Thy paths ? I seek, and there
My goings I would place;
So shall I walk beneath Thy care
Until I see Thee face to face.

COMFORT.
Isaiah xl. 1, 2.
Like peaceful chimes o?er troubled waters pealing,
Sweet "words of God are speaking to my heart,
And, o?er my wounded spirit softly stealing,
A soothing influence of calm impart.
The Comfort ye of God is twice repeated,
To make assurance for us doubly sure,
That all our fears and foes may be defeated,
And heav?nly hope and holy joy endure.
?Tis God who saith it, and will say it ever;
Where else for consolation could we look 1
His word is Comfort ye, and faileth never,
Graven for all in his most holy Book.
Our sin is pardon?d; richly grace aboundeth j
Limits are set to the chastising rod :
And still thro? ev?ry sorrow sweetly soundeth,
That, 1 Comfort ye my people, saith our God.?

LIGHT.
Isaiah xlii. 16,
God the cheering word has spoken,
Word which never can be broken,
Shining star-like, through the night;
1 will make the darkness light.
Is thy sky o?ercast with gloom 1
Seems for radiance left no room 1
Thro? some rift hope darteth bright,
God ivill make the darkness light.
Doth some sorrow cast a shade 1
Art thou of some woe afraid 1
Soothe thy sorrow, quit thy fright;
God will make the darkness light.
Dark and dang?rous seems the path 1
Black with sin, and Satan?s wrath 'I
On thy side is Christ?s own might ;
God will make the darkness light.
Anxious is thy soul and vex?d 1
Still with mystery perplex?d 1
Seest nought to left or right 1
God will make the darkness light.
Patiently pursue thy way,
Night still groweth into day;
And, on Zion?s holy height,
God will make the darkness light.

THE DAYSPRING FROM ON HIGH.
Luke it. 78.
Hail ! to the mom
When Christ was bom,
To banish night,
And give us light,
Light that shall grow and never die,
Light of ?the Day spring from on high.?
Hail! to the morn
When Christ was born,
To conquer sin,
And help us win
Joy that shall grow and never die,
Joy of ? the Dayspring from on high.?
Hail! to the morn
When Christ was born,
To give us scope
For boundless hope,
Hope that shall grow and never die,
Hope of the ? Dayspring from on high.?
Hail ! to the morn
When Christ was born,
And from above
Brought endless love,
Love that shall grow and never die,
Love of ? the Dayspring from on high.?
Hail! blessed Christ!
Treasure unpric?d!
Hope, Joy, and Love,
Come from above,
Light that will grow and never die,
Light of ?the Dayspring from on high.?

THE SAVIOUR?S TEARS.
John xi. 35,
The Saviour wept : He let the streaming tears
Pour down His human face;
Oh ! surely in that flood appears
A plenitude of grace !
The Son of God is here the Son of Man,
And might meets tenderness;
The Love Divine, that all things can,
Stoops low that it may bless ;
The Saviour wept ; for Sorrow stirr?d within
His quick discerning mind,
Making survey of death and sin
And woes of ev?ry kind.
The Saviour wept; and show?d his Sympathy
With suffering and grief ;
His tears were not shed selfishly ;
In them is sweet relief.
For tho? He wept, He timely Succour gave,
And bade the dead man live,
In Him the mourners comfort have
Which He alone could give.
Now may this precious mem?ry, treasur?d well
Within my heart be kept,
Vain joys to sober, ?to repel
Vain griefs,?that Jesus wept.

ar a b off.
Acts ii. 39.
The silly sheep are scatter'd far
O?er hill, and heath, and wold ;
Will ye not help to gather them
Into the shelter?d fold 1
Poor ignorant wanderers afar,
Bereft of comfort, roam ;
Will ye not help to welcome them
Into the happy Home?
Far from the knowledge that can give
Bight thoughts of God above ;
Far from the feelings that can stir
To holiness and love;
Far from the hopes that soothe our woe
And make hard duties light;
Far from the heav?n born faith that makes
Our darkest hours bright,
The heathen wander, ?but Goi) calls,
And He would have them hear,
Oh ! let us speed His message kind,
And help to bring them Near.

THE LIVING LORD.
Bom. xiv. 9
0 Living Lord, who in death struggle dire
Didst triumph over death, and vict?ry win
O?er devil?s malice, and the might of sin,
Nor e?er didst of Thy wondrous warfare tire,
How should the thought of Thee, victorious, fire
Our hearts with love and patient loyalty,
To do, and to endure, continually
Whate?er our Lord of service may require !
For Thou didst die, and rise, and live again,
To be the Lord of all, both quick and dead,
Thro? ev?ry land, and on from age to age ;
Redeemer, Master, Judge ! by triple chain
Our hearts, lives, consciences, are subjected
To Thee, who hast the world for heritage.

GOD ALL IN ALL.
1 Cor. xv. 28.
God all in all ! 0 blissful vision bright
That dazzles with excess of heav?nly light!
What wondrous range of thought, desire, hope,
These words unfold to us, who daily grope
Amid our fallen world?s perplexities !
Sin?s fatal fruit, grim troops of sicknesses,
Heart piercing sorrows, vices foul, yea ! death,
The last dread enemy (e?en so God saith,)
Shall disappear, and be destroy?d ; and then
God shall be perfectly obey?d again ;
The Universe, responsive to His call,
Shall find its goal, and God be all in all.
Bright beams the vision of that beauteous Rest,
Which nought impure or sad shall e?er infest;
Where work that wearies not shall aye employ
Unfading faculties of life and joy;
When what now seems the long-impeded plan
Of upward progress for the world of man
Shall to its destin?d end divine be brought,
And gain completion far beyond our thought.
Ah ! tho? the vision be not always clear,
Still ever and anon I seem to hear,
Now softly sweet, then like a trumpet call,
That voice of hope, God shall be all in all.

ASLEEP IH JESUS.
1 Thess. iv. Ifr.
Freed from tlie body?s feebleness,
Freed from all painful weariness,
Freed from the yoke of daily toil,
The world?s disquiet and turmoil.
Asleep, they rest,
Jesus blest.
And He is with them, they with Him,
In visions of delight, tho? dim ;
They feel no pain, they have no fear,
They dread no woe, they shed no tear ;
In sleep they rest,
With Jesus, blest.
And ever in their visions they
Are stirr?d by hope of coming day,
When glorious bodies they shall take,
And in full vigour, joyful, wake;
And thus they rest,
In Jesus, blest.
O blessed sleep ! O visions glad !
The thought of death need not be sad,
To those for whom it ends all strife
And is a stage to fuller life,
To those who rest,
In Jesus, blest.

PRAYER AND PRAISE.
James v. 13
Art thou troubled in thy life,
Sore beset by sin and strife 1
Weary, wounded, worn with care,
Tempted almost to despair 1
Lift thy heart in prayer.
Does some foe or fear assail thee ]
Does some wonted comfort fail thee 1
Seems there none thy grief to share;
None that can thy burden bear!
Lift thy heart in prayer.
Prayer will bring a sure relief;
Prayer will soothe thee in thy grief ;
Prayer will drive thy fears away ;
Prayer will change thy night to day;
Lift thy heart, and pray.
Then when gladness comes again,
When thy heart is free from pain,
When the sunshine?s welcome rays
Greet thee in thy various ways,
Lift thy heart, and praise.
When thou know?st thy sins forgiven
When thou boldest hopes of heaven,
When, from care and sorrow free,
Thou enjoy?st thy liberty,
Do it thankfully.
Help us, Lord, in prayerful mood
Still to live, with gratitude ;
Still to thee our hearts upraise
Both in glad and mournful days ;
Blending Prayer and Praise.

THE TREE OF LIFE.
Rev. ii. 7.
? Tlie tree of life ? which grew in Eden,
How beautiful it must have been !
But sinful man was soon forbidden
To linger near the glorious scene :
Ah ! vanish?d soon the fruit immortal,
From human sight, and touch, and taste ;
And swords cherubic kept the portal,
Whence man was sent into the waste.
Yet ?trees of life? men still ai?e craving;
They seek for wisdom, pleasure, wealth,
And many dangers will be braving,
With sacrifice of time and health :
Alas ! our earth?s in sad condition,
God?s garden is no longer here !
We may not gain the wish?d fruition,
The tree of life?s no longer here !
But hark ! a cheering promise soundeth,
From Christ the Saviour and the King;
And, whoso faith upon Him foundeth,
To each this promise joy doth bring;
To all who conquer in the sti'iving,
Whilst earthly paths are being trod,
? The tree of life? Christ will be giving
Within ? the paradise of God.?

THE MORNING STAB.
llt>r. xx ii. 10.
As torn with doubt, and toss?d with pain I lay,
A gentle voice came to my heart one day,
Which seem?d to still the sorrows of my soul,
And make my sorely wounded spirit whole.
It was the voice of Jesus in His word,
A voice unheeded oft, tho? often heard ;
It spake of power above a world of sin,
It spake of peace above a world of din,
It spake of hope beyond a world of death,
And, like God?s primal vivifying breath
Infus?d, made me a living man again,
Strong, in God?s might, to conquer ill and pain :
And oft as sorrow, doubt, or fear, assails,
That voice to comfort, and to calm, avails,
Which nigh me seems, yet from the Height afar
Proclaims, � am the anh Jttonung (Star,
