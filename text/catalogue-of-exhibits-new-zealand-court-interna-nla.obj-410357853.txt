All the lessons are based upon the concrete forms as found in Tablets Nos. 4,

These Ethnological Collections are exhibited with a view to show that
all people in every part of the world, when arrived at a certain stage of
civilization, manufactured and manufacture their stone implements in
exactly the same manner; also that, at least for New Zealand and
Chatham Islands, we cannot divide the stone implements into paheolithic
and neolithic ones, both kinds having been used by the Moa hunters
and the Morioris at the same time.

The three Moa skeletons were articulated from material obtained
in the Tertiary deposits at Glenmark, after studying carefully some
complete skeletons found in Otago. Selected to illustrate the three
most remarkable groups into which the Exhibitor has divided the
Dinornithidae.

9 Greyhound
10 Bull Dog
11 Monkey
12 Man
Each skull is longitudinally bisected, and is so placed that the series of bones
forming the base of the skull ( basis cranii ) is horizontal. The direction of this
series of hones is shown by a red wire, which thus represents the cranial axis.
From the fore end of this red wire a Hue wire is continued along the bones form-
ing the axis of the face, and so marks th e facial axis. The green wire indicates
•the direction of the ethemoidal plane by which the cavity of the brain-case is
separated from the chamber of the nose ; the black wire, of the tentorial plane,
or plane of separation between the greater brain or cerebrum and the lesser brain
or cerebellum; the yellow wire, the occipital plane, or plane of the aperture
{occipitalforamen'), through which the spinal cord becomes continuous with the
brain. The outline diagrams represent the position of the brain in the skull in
the lowest (frog) and highest (man) members of the series, the cranial axis being
made of the same absolute length in both. It will be seen that with the increased
relative size of the brain, the facial axis, a c, becomes bent downward upon the
cranial axis, a b, the angle cab being, in man, nearly a right angle, instead of,
as in the frog, equal to two right angles. At the same time the ethemoidal plane,
a d, is rotated forwards, the angle dab, a right angle in the frog, becoming
greater than two right angles in man ; and the tentorial and occipital planes are
rotated backwards, the angles a g e, ab f, becoming obtuse instead of right angles.

238— Dignan, R. Auckland.
Silk
The insects were reared in Auckland in a temperature between 65° and 75° with-
out any extraordinary precaution to obtain the degree of heat, as the climate is all


that could be wished for. The eggs hatched spontaneously about the end of
October, rather later than usual. The moultings took place on the Bth, 15th, 24th,
and 30th days respectively of the age of the worms. Twelve days afterwards all
were spinning, and those which were placed for seed burst the cocoons within
eighteen days after commencing to spin. It will thus be seen that the worms
require to be fed during six weeks. Three hundred and sixty cocoons weighed one
pound avoirdupois, and from a pound of cocoons I obtained an ounce of reeled silk,
winding seven cocoons to the thread with a machine of the simplest construction.
A better result might have been attained in reeling, as all the silk was not
extracted from the cocoons, my principal object being to get eggs for next year;
and I only fed at the rate of 60 lbs. of leaves to 3000 silkworms, whereas at least
one-half as much more could have been consumed —100 lbs. being a fair average
amount of food for that number of cocoons, which ought to yield a pound of reeled
silk.

Silk (the produce of 1000 Silkworms reared by R. Graham,

The Towai (Weinmannia racemosa) is an indigenous tree largely distributed
over the hilly lands in many parts of New Zealand ; it is often to be met with
four or five feet in diameter, and from thirty to sixty feet in height. It grows
frequently in clusters united at the base in a large tubular stoloniferous root, and
in numerous instances round Mount Egmont the tree forms a natural bridge over
the stream, as it first grows upright on the bank, and then gradually inclines over
until its top reaches the land on the other side ; there it rests, a forest of young
trees springing up vertically from the prostrate trunk. A zone of thirty miles,
three miles in width round the high lands of Mount Egmont is clothed exclusively
with Towai, whilst throughout the whole district the banks of most of the rivers
will yield a large supply. A reference to,the map will show the distribution. The
Extract is unusually rich in tannin and forms good leather, and as a dye will
yield all the shades obtainable from gambler. It can be cheaply rendered.
In case B the first four Extracts are astringent, of greater or less value.
No, 11, Hinau (Eloeocarpus dentatus), is of sufficient importance to deserve a
special notice.
The Hinau is an evergreen forest tree of considerable dimensions. The bark is
used by the natives in dyeing black their beautiful flax mats. The flax after a
soaking in a hot fusion of the bark is buried for a time in the red iron mud so
abundant in the stagnant pools. The Hinau can only be considered of value as a
dye, yielding yellow buffs and blacks.
No. 12 is an Extract of the Pukatea (Atherosperma Novas Zealandse), It is
a valuable tonic, much in use amongst the Maoris as a remedy for neuralgia. In
selecting a tree for stripping, they always take one that has been exposed to the
fullest effects of the sun’s rays.

Model of Alves’ Patent Silt Elevator and Carrier
This is a machine, or rather a combination of two machines, for raising stnff
from a punt and afterwards carrying it to almost any distance required, at any
rate within reason. Messrs. Alves and Ho worth are the patentees, and patents
have been taken out in New Zealand, the Australian colonies, and America.
The working model exhibited is on a scale of inchs to the foot, and the
carrier, as it stands, can take the stuff nearly a chain—that is, proportionately to scale.
In full-size machine the ropes will be crucible steel, flat or round, as may be
required for the special work to be done.
The clips will be made of steel moulded to fit strands of ropes. (See clips
screwed to top rail of model.) Each clip will be fastened by bolt and nut, and
will bear a strain on each bucket of two tons without slipping.


The buckets will be made of steel-plate and capable of holding 2 cwt. of
material. The lifting buckets will be fastened to the ropes with 4 clips to each to
resist a strain on each bucket of 4 tons. The carrying buckets are reversible and
easily adjusted.
Whenever it becomes necessary to extend the carrying ladder, a wire rope is
stretched over the trestles to the distance required.
The bucket-ladder can be made of sufficient length and strength to dredge
direct from bottom of docks or rivers instead of lifting the material out of punts,
as shown.
By fixing the lifting-ladder in front of the machine, a canal can be cut and
the material carried and deposited by one and the same operation.
There being no pins to wear as in pitch chains, and the ropes passing smoothly
over the pulley-wheels, the wear and tear is reduced to a minimum, great rapidity
of speed is gained, and a great saving of engine-power is effected.

Building Stones of Canterbury.
The building stones of Canterbury are principally derived from two very
distinct sources, of which the first, furnishing freestones of excellent quality and
generally of considerable hardness, is of volcanic origin.
These are mostly obtained from Banks Peninsula, and are probably of middle
tertiary age. The rest of the building stones, mostly of a calcareous nature, are
derived from the upper portion of two well defined sedimentary deposits, named
the Waipara and Oamaru formations, the first being of cretaceo-tertiary, and the
latter of upper eocene or lower miocene age. The hard building stones of volcanic
origin quarried in Banks Peninsula are derived either from basaltic lava streams,
in which case they are generally used for rubble and for dressed ashlar work, or
they are taken from dykes generally of a trachytic character. These dyke rocks,
for every kind of architectural work, are very useful, and form in many instances
beautiful building stones of rich colour and fine texture.
The calcareous sandstones usually called limestones are of light colours, from
brownish-grey to a creamy white, and of a varying degree of hardness, but they
can all be cut with a saw when taken from a quarry. Afterwards they gradually
become much harder when being exposed to the air, an excellent quality for a
building stone of that class. An almost unlimited supply of this building material
can be obtained.

Carved Panels of an Ancient Maori Rqnanga House
These are the principal carved panels of the famous house “ Matatua,” and are
so placed as to form the lining of the machinery annexe of the New Zealand Court.
The house itself was originally built at the suggestion of Hohaia Matatehokia,
chief of the Ngatipukeho tribe, for the purpose of representing therein all their
ancestors. It was completed in 1874, and in March, 1875, was formally opened by
the late Sir Donald M'Lean with great demonstrations, in the presence of many
hundreds of native and European visitors. The image on each post represents the
ancestor of some tribe or sub-tribe.

Stone Column with Capital
Obelisk Block
The Oamaru stone is a white calcareous sandstone or granular limestone.
According to the Government Analyst its chemical constituents are as follows :
100-00
This places it in the same class as the oolites of England and the Caen stone of France.
The Oamaru stone has a remarkable uniformity of colour and texture, and can
be obtained in large blocks. Like all stones of this kind it is quite soft when
quarried, but hardens rapidly on exposure to a dry atmosphere. This enables it to
be worked into the most elaborate ornamentation at little cost.
The stone is rather porous for use in a damp situation, but it answers well in
ordinary walls and columns in a moderately dry climate, and it is unexcelled for
internal decorations.

Model Wave Power Machine
This machine could be used to compress air, to drive an air engine, or
to work the electric light at any lighthouse, or for other purposes on
the sea coast. No difference would be made in the forward motion by
the irregularity of the waves. With a cylinder 20 ft. in diameter and
8-ft. wave per minute, the machine would be equal to 19 horse-power •
and with three waves per minute, each 5 ft., it would give 22 horse-
power. It has been favourably reviewed in “ The English Mechanic
and World of Science” of 22nd October, 1875.

Works and Improvements at the Port of Lyttelton, Canterbury,
illustrated by a model of Lyttelton Plarbuur
Breahvaters. —The breakwaters are formed of rubble stone blasted from the
quarries at Naval and Officer’s Points, and deposited on the respective sites as
shown in the model—the outer slopes of both breakwaters are protected or faced
with huge blocks of stone. The Officer’s Point, or Eastern Breakwater, is some
2010 feet in length, with a width of 40 feet on top, and having an elevation of
6 feet above high water spring tide. The Naval Point Breakwater is 1400 feet in
length. The former breakwater has also a timber breastwork built along its inner
face for nearly its entire length—known as the Gladstone Pier,
Water Area Enclosed. —The area of water enclosed within the breakwaters is
about 110 acres.
Dredging. —Dredging operations have been proceeding almost uninterruptedly
for the past four years, during which period nearly a million and a-half tons
of dredged material, consisting of stiff clay and mud, have been removed, at an
average cost of 6jd. per cubic yard. The dredging plant used has been a single
ladder dredge and two steam hopper barges, the holding capacity of the latter


being 250 tons each. The dredged material is removed by them to a distance of
three and a-half miles, and then deposited. The present depth of water inside the
breakwaters and at the wharves varies from 16 feet up to 23 feet at low tide.
The rise vpf tide being about 7 feet, vessels up to 2700 tons can now be safely-
berthed at the wharves.
Moorings. —Eight sets of Mitchell’s patent screw moorings are laid down in
the inner harbour, capable of holding vessels up to 2000 tons.
Berthage Space for Vessels within the Inner Harbour, Lyttelton. —The
berthage space at the wharves as shown in the model is as follows: —
Gladstone Pier ... ... ... ... 1740 feet.
Timber breastwork from Gladstone Pier westward to
Naval Point ... ... ... ... 3850 „
Jetties —

Making a total of ... ... ... ... 10,260 „
Which would be capable of berthing the following number of vessels
20 ocean ships and steamers
20 barques and brigs
6 intercolonial steamers
30 schooners, &c.
This berthage space is capable of very considerable extension, by the construction
of additional jetties.
Expenditure on Harbour Works in Lyttelton. —The total amount expended
upon harbour works in Lyttelton is not far short of half a million sterling, which
includes the purchase of the dredging plant, and also of a powerful steam tug,
built to the special order of the Lyttelton Harbour Board by Messrs. Laird, of
Birkenhead,
Railway Lines on Wharves and Jetties. —The whole of the wharves and
jetties in Lyttelton have lines of rails laid down upon them, and are worked by
the Railway.
Graving Dock. —The Graving Dock shown on the model is now being con-
structed, and when completed will be capable of docking a first-class ironclad. The
general dimensions of the dock are as follows :
Length on floor 400 feet
Width on floor 46 ~
Width on top ... ... ... 82 „
Width of entrance ... ... ... 62 ~

General. —The port of Lyttelton, which is situate on the north-western side of
Banks Peninsula, having an opening to the north-east, is the chief seaport town of
the Provincial District of Canterbury. This district comprises some 8,693,000
acres, a large proportion of which is fine agricultural land, intersected by lines of
railway, some 400 miles in length. The population of Canterbury, by census taken
in the early part of the year 1878, was 91,922.

This sample is from a lode in the coal bed at Orepuki. The bed of coal seems to
be of great extent and dips to the west at an inclination of 1 in 30, depth not
known, but 18 feet has been sunk through, and no signs of bottom. In this coal
the lode of shale dips to the west at an angle of 45 degrees. The sample sent is
the thickness of the seam, or in other words, 5 feet. The sample is taken from an
outcrop, but in sinking, the quality appears to improve. The shale has been traced.
30 chains, but the coal has been sunk in to a depth of 12 feet at a distance of three
miles from where the sample is taken, and it is supposed the shale continues as far.
A sample of the shale yielded at the rate of 45 gallons crude oil to the ton.

Taranaki Iron-sand in its various stages of manufacture
Septaria
Titanic iron-sand occurs widely disseminated in the tufaceous lavas of Mount
Egmont. By the erosion of the streams which flow from the cone a considerable
quantity of this substance is set free from its matrices, and conveyed to the sea
coast in alluvium. Here, by the action of the waves, a mechanical separation
between it and the earthy particles of the tufa takes place, the earthy matter being
carried out to sea, while the iron-sand in a state of great purity, is left on the
beaches. At the months of rivers the sand is found in the greatest purity, and in
such places is often found to contain 90 per cent, of the pure ore. This black,
sparkling, metallic sand, extending for miles along the coasts, early attracted the
attention of travellers and settlers, and many attempts have been made towards its
utilisation. One of the first persons to attempt the reduction of this ore was Mr.
Weekes, the Colonial Surgeon at New Plymouth, who in 1841 reported to Captain
Liardet, the New Zealand Company’s Agent, that he had melted some of the sand,
had discovered that it contained from 80 to 90 per cent, of iron, and had obtained
a beautiful specimen. In November, 1842, the following analysis of the ore was
given by Mr. Robert Oxland, of Plymouth, England, to whom a parcel of the sand
had been by Mr. Weekes :—“Sample No. 5 is magnetic iron ore, in the form of
fine sand from the sea shore. It consists of peroxide and protoxide of iron mixed,


containing about 71 per cent, of iron. It is free from the admixture of other
substances, and, if obtainable in large quantities, is likely to be at some future
time in considerable demand, as it is the most valuable of iron ores. The
celebrated Swedish iron ores, in such high repute for the making of steel, is
obtained from a mineral of precisely the same character,” The following is
the formula of the most recent analysis of this sand : —Magnetite, 71 - 0;
titanite, B'o ; quartz and olivine, 21 •()—IOOO. The early attempts to reduce
this ore were made by means of crucibles, and by this method, when
the proper fluxes were used, the operation was practicable, although a very
considerable degree of heat was found to be necessary, But when the sand
was tried in a blast furnace, difficulties of an apparently insurmountable character
presented themselves. One difficulty was that much of the sand burned and was
driven by the blast out of the top of the furnace. Another difficulty was that
what ore was not blown away filtered down through the fire and formed a cake on
the hearth. At length the idea occurred of forming the sand into bricks by the
addition of tufaceous clay, and of introducing it in that form to the furnace. The
brick now exhibited in connection with the Taranaki iron-sand at the present
Exhibition is a specimen of these cakes of ore, and is composed of one part of tufa
and three parts iron, and mixed with fresh water and burned in a clump or stack.
The iron exhibited is a specimen of the metal produced at the New Zealand Titanic
Iron and Steel Company’s Works, Te Henui, Taranaki, on the 23rd September, 1876,
according to the following improved formula : —lron-sand, 1 ton 10 cwts.; tufaceous
clay, 1 ton ; ground charcoal, 1 cwt.; lime, 2 cwt. 2 qrs.; mixed with sea-water and
moulded by a machine. The cakes made according to this formula have the
advantage of solidifying by themselves without the aid of burning, the intimate
admixture of the charcoal aids the carbonising of the ore and the lime operates
immediately on it as flux. The salts remaining after the evaporation of the mixing-
water also aid in the fluxing. The excellence of the metal produced from this ore
by a charcoal furnace is accounted for by its absolute freedom from phosphorus
and sulphur, the deteriorating ingredients whose presence in iron is productive of
those forms of brittleness known respectively as cold-shortness and hot-shortness,
while the presence of titanium in it adds to its toughness.

THE COUNTY OP WESTLAND, N.Z,
GENERAL DESCRIPTION.
Westland is the central part of the West Coast of the Middle
Island. In 1861 this part of the colony was purchased by the Govern-
ment from the native owners, of whom there were not more than thirty
at that time. The district thus acquired extends from the Province of
Nelson on the north to the Province of Otag’o on the south, and from the
Province of Canterbury on the east to the sea coast on the west; its
boundaries being, on the north the river Grey, on the south the river
Awarua (flowing into Big Bay), and on the east the watershed of the
Southern Alps. Of the total area of Westland (4442 square miles),
the mountain ranges and forest lands occupy 2,843,141 acres ; the
rivers aud lakes, 29,759 acres ; and open country, 172,800 acres;
making in all 3,045,700 acres.
After the purchase and annexation of the West Coast to Canterbury
in 1861, the former was occasionally visited by surveyors and others in
search of pastoral country; they, however, met with great hardships at
that early period, and not a few lost their lives in fording the swiftly
runnino- rivers. Little advance was made towards settlement until gold-
hunters penetrated its wild and inhospitable interior. This occurred
during the latter part of 1863 and the beginning of 1864, The first
discovery of gold was reported on the Hohonu, a northern tributary of
the Teremakau. The Hohonu rises in Mount French—named after
Mr, Michael French, an early settler in the Grey Valley. He
was one of the leading prospectors of that and other localities. About
the same time, also, a party of Scandinavians, having ventured in
a boat from Invercargill, prospected the Totara district, and their
labours were rewarded by discovering gold in a small mountain stream
taking its rise at Mount Greenland, the ravine through which it flows
being known at the present day as Scandinavian Gully. This stream
empties itself into Donnelly’s Creek by a waterfall just above the
junction, and later on joins with the river Totara. Subsequently, the
Kanieri and other places were discovered, and from that time a rush set
in to the West Coast. During the latter part of 1864 and early in 1865,
the main rush commenced, and from that time forward the discoveries
of auriferous deposits were continuous in all directions, from one
extremity of the coast to the other, and in such rapid succession that,
within a short space of time, the West Coast, from north of the river


Grey to the southern boundary, was clearly shown to be a vast con-
tinuous goldfield.
In consequence of its increased importance and great natural
resources, the West Coast of Canterbury was created an independent
district on the Ist of January, 1868, under the appellation of the
County of Westland. In 1874 the county was made a province, and
on the abolition of the provincial form of government in New
Zealand, Westland was again made a county, with a reduced area.
The portion north of the river Teremakau, containing an area of
255,460 acres, was added to the Grey County, leaving, however,
to the County of Westland the considerable area of 2,790,300
acres, of which 31,950 acres are apportioned as freehold, and
76,637 acres represent lakes, rivers, and general reserves, which leaves
the handsome area of 2,681,713 acres to be appropriated at the present
time.
Hokitika, the chief town, was founded in 1864. It is situated at
the mouth and on the north hank of the Hokitika River, formerly
called Okatiki, and has a population of above 3000 souls. It contains
a town hall, supreme court-house, and other judicial and administrative
buildings, a general post-office and telegraph office, all of considerable
architectural pretentions, also a large and most commodious theatre, and
a public library. There is large wharf accommodation, and owing to
the improvement of the entrance of the river, caused by the protection
works, now nearly completed, an excellent harbour is afforded for
vessels of 200 tons burden. The town is well laid out with large public
squares and other recreation grounds; and there are, in connection
with the town, a public hospital, lunatic asylum, and gaol.
The Kanieri district includes the land between the Arahura and
Hokitika Rivers, and the land on the south bank of the Hokitika River
as far as Lake Mahinipua. Besides the Kanieri, Kokotahi, and
Mahinipua townships, this district contains the mining centres of
Blue Spur, Big Paddock, Woodstock, and Eight-mile. The township
of Kanieri is situated on the banks of the Hokitika River, and is
backed by a large agricultural and grazing district. Woodstock
is opposite to it, on the other side of the river. Gold mining,
timber-cutting, and farming are the chief industries of this district. The
whole of the timber exported from the port of Hokitika is cut in the
Kanieri district. There are large areas of agricultural land not sold
in the Kokotahi Valley, and between it and the Hokitika River.
TheTotara district extends from the Kanieri district to the Mikonui
River, and includes the town of Ross, and the mining districts of
Donoghue’s, Donnelly’s Creek, and Redman’s ; the tributaries of the
Totara and Mikonui Rivers being all auriferous. Ross was founded in
1865, and is situated south of Donnelly’s Creek, a tributary of the
Totara River, in the centre of one of the richest alluvial deposits of gold,
if not in New Zealand, at least in Westland. It is a pleasant inland
town, about 18 miles south of Hokitika, with which it is connected
by an excellent road, which extends to Okarita. All intermediate rivers
between Hokitika and Ross are bridged. The population of Ross is
above 1170 souls. It possesses a court-house, post and telegraph offices,


town-hall, library, a public and other schools, and an excellent local
hospital. The prosperous future of Ross, as a large gold-producing
locality, with proper appliances, can hardly be doubted.
The mines near Ross were worked with the aid of powerful steam
pumping machinery. Gold has been found in them in six different
layers, in depths from 50 feet to 450 feet. Most of these mines are at
present flooded out, and perhaps will remain so till capital is introduced
into the district to work the mines on an extensive system. A large
race (surveys and plans of which have been prepared) to carry water
from the Mikonui River to near Ross is much needed, and would prove
reproductive, as the deep claims can be worked with water-power far
less expensively than with steam. The main industry of this district is
gold mining, which is extensively carried on in the terraces.
The Okarita distict comprises all that part of the district between
the river Mikonui and the southern boundary of the county. Gold
mining is the only occupation followed in this district. There are
scarcely any mines being worked inland, except up one or two of the
rivers; the miners rest satisfied with obtaining gold easily in the beach
workings. In many of the beaches of this district (as well as in other
parts of the coast), after bad weather and a heavy sea, the sand on the
sea-beach is found impregnated with gold, and, after the sand has been
scraped off the beach, and the g’old extracted, there is likely to be, after
the next heavy sea, a similar quantity of gold found in the beach sand
in the same localities. The district has had but little attention paid to
it, either by the miners or settlers. It has two splendid harbours
Bruce Bay and Jackson’s Bay —and several rivers with good entrances
and depth of water. It has easy access to the Province of Otago and the
• East Coast by the saddle at the head of the Haast River, and it
possesses large tracts of auriferous land, fine agricultural land, and
splendid grazing country and timber.
Northward of Hokitika is the Ivumara district. The township of
Kumara was founded in 1876, and is situated south of the l eremakau,
about seven miles inland from the ocean beach. Its site is a large
auriferous flat extending’ many miles in all directions, and the
population is above 900 souls. It is a fine inland town, with
regular, broad streets, about eighteen miles north-east of Hokitika,
with which it is connected by excellent roads, as also with direct roads
with Greymouth and Christchurch. There are a court-house, post
and telegraph offices, public school, town-hall, and a local hospital.
GENERAL FEATURES.
Some of the most picturesque scenery that even New Zealand can
boast of is to be found in Westland. Between the Southern Alps, whose
snowy peaks pierce the sky at a height of nearly ,14,000 feet, and the
coast line may be seen an infinite variety of the grandest alpine and
forest scenery. One of the largest glaciers on the western slope of the
main range of mountains is the Francis Joseph Glacier, descending from
Mount Cook. The face of this magnificent glacier is about half a mile


in breadth and of considerable height, and may be easily reached from
Hokitika by coach road to Okarito (40 miles), and tiience by a fair
bridle track some twelve miles up the Waiho river bed. Dense forests,
exhibiting new and beautiful forms of vegetation, including the gigantic
scarlet flowering myrtle, the rata, one of the largest forest trees, and
graceful tree-ferns, clothe the mountain-slopes and much of the
undulating lower country towards the sea coast.
CLIMATE.
Notwithstanding the very heavy rainfall in Westland (118 inches
per annum, average), the climate is remarkably healthy; the tempera-
ture, compared with other parts of New Zealand, being exceptionally
equable. Animal life of all kinds thrives well, and the growth of
vegetation is surprisingly rapid and vigorous.
LAND.
Of the two millions of acres of unsold land in Westland, the larger
part consists of mountains and dense forests, but there are, in places,
considerable areas of open country, chiefly between the low lying hills
and the main range, of splendid agricultural land, having from six to
ten feet of rich black soil. There is very little improved land in private
hands open for sale to persons of small capital. Most of the holders of
improved lands have themselves made the improvements; but any one
anxious to secure a homestead, with a market to dispose of his produce,
will find it a not very difficult task, as every facility for the purchase
of land is offered by the Government.
For the purpose of forming special settlements in the southern por-
tions of Westland, three blocks in the Okarito district have been set
apart; one containing 20,000 acres, between the Mikonui and Wan-
ganui Rivers; one containing 50,000 acres, from the Saltwater River
southwards for 17 miles, of a depth of three miles and a quarter; and
one of 50,000 acres, in the neighbourhood of the Haast River.
Within the last four years a good deal of country has been taken
up for pastoral purposes ; and although agriculture has not yet become
a prominent feature in the industrial aspect of the district, the number
of farms dotted over the county is yearly increasing, the favourable
nature of the climate, combined with the natural fertility of the soil,
rendering farming, when once the land is cleared of bush, a very profit-
able pursuit.
TRADE.
Considering the important part which mining plays in the prosperity
of Westland, and the uncertain character which generally attaches to
this industry, the trade of the district for the last three years, or at least
that portion represented by the exports, shows remarkable steadiness.
In 1877 the imports were valued at £122,326, and the exports at


£213,616; in the year following the imports amounted to £99,680,
and exports to £243,068; and in 1879 the imports were valued at
£67,696, and the exports at £267,824.
MINING.
That which was originally the making of Westland—gold-mining —
is now also its main industry. Although the population of Westland
(about 12,000) is not now so large as in the first fervour of the great
rush, the produce of gold has been maintained—a fact which speaks
well for the permanency and richness of the district as a gold-producing
country.
The quantity of gold exported from the port of Hokitika during the
year 1879 was 54,203 ounces, value £216,933. The export for the
quarters ending 31st March and 30th June, 1880, were respectively
14,275 ounces, value £57,098, and 13,383 ounces, value £53,533. The
total quantity of gold exported from the West Coast, from the first
discovery of gold to 30th June, 1880, amounted to 2,485,512 ounces,
value £9,849,016. ,
A map of the County of Westland, prepared by Mr. Gerhard
Mueller, chief surveyor, and forwarded to the Melbourne International
Exhibition, shows the various localities where gold has been obtained.
In no district thus marked, except in the case of Ross, has gold been
worked to any considerable depth; so that it has been truly said that
as yet the surface of the country has only been scratched over.
Eeef and lode mining has hardly yet been entered upon in West-
land, but many important and promising discoveries in this direction
have been made. Thus, on the Taipo River, in the northern part of
the district, quartz reefs, averaging about an ounce of gold to the tou,
have been explored; and at Mount Eangitoto, south of Hokitika, a
lode band occurs, carrying, besides auriferous pyrites, argentiferous
galena, and zinc blende.
In the gorge of the Hokitika River a similar association of magne-
sian rocks occurs as that which characterises the copper and chrome
mineral belts in Nelson, and the general geological structure of the
country points to a recurrence throughout the district of isolated areas
of a gold-bearing formation similar to that which has proved so rich at
Reefton in the Nelson Province.
TIMBER.
Westland offers a good many advantages for the development of a
large timber trade. The forest lands occupy more than two-thirds of
its total area, and are easily accessible. The rivers are not more than
four or five miles apart, so that in localities where there are no roads
the timber can be floated down to the coast. The timber consists of
black, red, white, and silver pines; black, red, and white birches;
miro, totara, rata, kawhaka, cedar, and manuka. The quality of the
timber generally is excellent, and samples have been forwarded to the


Melbourne Exhibition. Considerable quantities have been exported,
but the expansion of the trade is much cramped by want of freight
facilities, the quantity exported being, in a great measure, limited to the
tonnage offered by vessels bringing in cargoes, such vessels carrying
away the timber as return cargo.
OTHER RESOURCES.
One of the exhibits forwarded to the Exhibition is a bale of flax,
from Westland.
The flax plant (Phormium tenax) is found in all parts of Westland,
the moist climate being very favourable for its growth; yet
nothing has been done to utilise it. On the banks of the rivers,
and in the swamps, flax grows luxuriantly. Samples of the only
kind dressed by the Maoris have the appearance of delicate glossed
satin. Another kind, the tai, is remarkable for its length of fibre
and great strength. The making of flax into rope and all kinds
of cordage could be carried on advantageously in Westland, as the
supply of flax is inexhaustible. If properly cultivated, and by stripping
only the outer leaves of the flax plant twice a year, each acre of land
would yield more than two tons of marketable flax.
In other parts of New Zealand, where the climate is not so favour-
able for the growth of flax, swamps have been drained, and, immediately
after, the plants that had a stunted growth of two feet commenced
growing till they attained a height of nine feet or ten feet.
All the rivers of Westland, and the hays in its southern parts,
abound with fish. If parties of men would organise, and settle in the
southern parts of the district, they would find fish-curing a profitable
occupation, more especially if they fitted out boats for whaling
and seal-catching, as whales are frequently cast on our shores, and
seals abound on the rocky parts of the coast; at seasons when
fishing may be dull the settlers could prospect for gold, as the
whole of the coast is auriferous. There are men scattered in the
southern parts of this province who, for the last five or six years, have
been gold-mining and doing nothing else. These men will not leave
the district, preferring to remain there, notwithstanding the difficulties
and expense of obtaining provisions. There are blocks of land set
apart for special settlements, and immigrants can easily obtain home-
steads in the southern parts, Bruce Bay and Jackson’s Bay, both well
sheltered, are good localities for the establishment of fishing stations.
Sites with water frontages to any of the rivers can be easily
obtained, and a supply of bark being at hand, tanneries could be
cheaply worked, and would probably give good returns, as the demand
for leather is very great, most of the population being engaged in
mining, in the bush, or other heavy work. If tanneries were established
boot factories would soon follow.
Brickmaking is another industry which might he entered upon
much more extensively than it is at present, if capital and labour were
more abundant. There is a good supply of good brick-clays, and also


of fire-clay of first-class quality. Several varieties of good building
stone exist, and a fine marble of close grain is obtainable at Caswell
Sound. Lithographic stone exists at the Abbey Rocks, and a sample
of this may be seen in the New Zealand Court of the Exhibition.
EDUCATION.
The system of Education adopted in Westland is the same as that
carried out in other parts of New Zealand, and is maintained by the
general Government of the colony. It is of the most liberal character
and special endowment reserves have been set apart for educational
purposes. The head school of Westland is in Hokitika, and is attended
by upwards of 400 children, out of a population of about 3000 souls.
There are also 25 branch schools, superintended and taught by about 50
teachers of all grades. The average number of scholars on the roll
being about 3500.

Introductory.
Addition of money, in small and large sums, occupies a portion of
the time of almost all persons, especially bankers, merchants, trades-
people, and housekeepers ; the object of this Machine is to enable this
work to be done by mechanical means with perfect accuracy.
All the weariness of mind often caused by long nights spent in
trying to find some small mistake in a balance-sheet, can be completely
obviated by it.
The tradesman or housekeeper, who does not even know how many
pence there are in a shilling, or how many shillings in a pound, can,
provided he has eyes to read figures, unaided produce his monthly
accounts, and make up his ledgers without a mistake after he has once
learnt to work the Machine ; this knowledge can be thoroughly acquired
in a very short time, some persons have achieved it in less than five
minutes.
Instructions are issued with each Machine, so as to render failure
impossible.
This Machine combines simplicity with accuracy, has no compli-
cated machinery in it, and is guaranteed to last for years —without
repair.
Any sums in addition, either in plain figures or in money, can be
performed with it.
All the cylinders are constructed upon the same principle, so that
to know how to work one is to know how to work all.
Machines for adding weights or measures of any kind can be sup-
plied by applying to Messrs. Stowe Brothers, 32 Essex Street, Strand;
or, to Leonard Stowe, Wellington, New Zealand.
Description.
The Machine consists of a number of cylinders, or rollers, with
figures printed thereon, zero or naught being represented by a red square.
To the left of the cylinders are a number of Indicators, each of which
records every perfect revolution of its corresponding cylinder.


To place the Machine ready for work the indicators must be turned
until zero or naught is visible ; and the cylinders must be turned so that
the zero or naught on the extreme left i.e., nearest to the indicators k
visible.
The Machine being placed as directed, we will proceed to exemplify
its mode of working—using the units cylinder.
First Example.
To add the following figures: —
4
Turn the cylinder towards you till 4 appears in the first column
at the left end —stop, start again from the Zero or Red Square, now
visible till you come to sin that column ; start again from the Zero or
Red Square, now visible, till you come to 7 in that column ; start again
from the Zero or Red Square, now visible, till you come to 3 in that
column ; start again from the Zero or Red Square, now visible, till you
come to 4 in that column.
On looking at the Indicator you will find figure 2 recorded, and figure
3 will be the figure now visible at the left end of the cylinder, the two
together making 23 which is the required total.
N.B. —The result of any addition will always be found by reading the
figures recorded on the indicators together with the first figure
on the left end of the cylinders.
Another Example,
To add the following figures :

Still working only on the units cylinder.
Indicator at Zero, left end of cylinder at Zero.
Turn cylinder to you till 8 appears in the left-hand column.
Turn cylinder to you, starting from the Zero now visible, till 6
appears in that column.
Turn cylinder to you, starting from the Zero now visible, till 7
appears in that column.
Turn cylinder to you, starting from the Zero now visible, till 1
appears in that column.
Turn cylinder to you, starting from the Zero now visible, till 5
appears in that column.
Indicator marks 2 ; first figure on left end of cylinder 7.
Set down 7, turn the Indicator to Zero, and start with 2 at the left
end of the cylinder.


Turn to you, starting from the Zero now visible, till 5 appears
in that column.
Turn to you, starting from the Zero now visible, till 5 appears
in that column.
Turn to you, starting from the Zero now visible, till 1 appears
in that column.
Turn to you, starting from the Zero now visible, till 9 appears
in that column.
Turn to you, starting from the Zero now visible, till 6 appears
in that column.
The Indicator marks 2 ; first figure on left end of cylinder 8.
Set down 8, turn the Indicator to Zero, and start with 2 at the left
end of the cylinder.
Turn to you, starting from the Zero now visible, till 2 appears
in that column.
Turn to you, starting from the Zero now visible, till 3 appears
in that column.
Turn to you, starting from the Zero now visible, till 4 appears
in that column.
Turn to you, starling from the Zero now visible, till 3 appears
in that column.
Indicator marks 1 ; first figure on left end of cylinder 4.
Set down 4, turn Indicator to Zero, and start with one at the left
end of the cylinder ,
Turn to you, starting from the Zero now visible, till 2 appears
in that column.
Turn to you, starting from the Zero now visible, till 1 appears
in that column.
The figure at the left end of the cylinder is 4.
The total obtained is 4,487.
Addition of Money.
This is performed on the Units Cylinder for Pounds, in a manner
similar to the explanation given above.
The Shillings Cylinder is used in exactly the same way, and when
any sum of Shillings is finished, the Pounds will be found on the Indicator
and the odd Shillings on the left end of the Cylinder, in the first division.
The Pence Cylinder is used in exactly the same way, and when any
sum is finished, the Shillings will he found on the Indicator, and the odd
Pence, on the left end of the Cylinder, in the first division.
It is an easy matter to transfer the Shillings on the Indicator, to the
Shillings Cylinder to make the addition complete, or to read off the odd
Shillings on the end of the Shillings Cylinder, with the Shillings on the
Pence indicator.
