SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA —The Queen ot the South Pacific,
CL
s
wYDNEY, the capital of the State of New South Wales, is the largest city in Australasia, and
the principal commercial centre of the South Pacific. Its population, which in 1909
jan numbered 605,000, is as numerous as that of Birmingham or Baltimore ; the value of its
mBI ratable property is greater than that of any other city in the British Empire, except
J[ London.
From its situation on the shores of the peerless harbour of Port Jackson, Sydney
has the distinction of being one of the most picturesque cities in the world. The chief
business and shopping centre is built upon the southern shore, and the principal
thoroughfares debouch upon the deepwater frontage of Circular Quay, where mammoth
ocean liners lie berthed side by side with the swift harbour ferries which bring the
waterside suburbs within ten to twenty minutes of the heart of the metropolis. Fast-
growing residential suburbs are spreading along the harbour front, where pleasant villas, built on the dark,
verdure-clad hills, look down upon the snow-white sails of scudding yachts or puffing tugs heaving on tow-lines
at the end of which huge steamers lunge sluggishly along the mighty port.
The splendid buildings of the city, with their domes and spires and massive blocks of handsome
structures, built of the warm light-brown sandstones which form Sydney’s foundations, impress the stranger,
on his voyage up the fairway from the harbour heads, with a metropolitan air as of some old-world capital.
The institutions of Sydney are of a kind to do credit to any city. The public buildings are palatial edifices, in
which the leading schools of architecture are worthily represented, from the Italian Renaissance of the Post
Office and the Lands Department to the Classic simplicity of the Art Gallery, and the Tudor battlements of
Government House. Sydney University, of which the Great Hall is a fine example of the Perpendicular Gothic,


SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA—THE QUEEN OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC.
provides instruction comparable with that of the best universities of the old world and America ; the schools and
colleges are of a high standard ; splendid cathedrals and churches adorn the capital ; while traffic is provided for
by swift electric trams connecting with the railways, which, like the tram-service, are owned by the State.
Industrially, Sydney is already great, and is destined to be greater. Its trade, reckoned by imports and exports,
reaches annually. A coal seam underlying the city and harbour is now being worked, and the
ceaseless clang of hammers on the anvils of dockyards tells of healthy maritime industry, for this is the port
whence is shipped the famous New South Wales merino wool, and the wheat, butter, mutton, coal, silver, gold,
and other products of the generous soil of a State whose million and a half inhabitants produce annually more
than £35 per head.
Sydney’s magnificent climate and beautiful surroundings place it above any other city in the world, from a
residential point of view. The temperature has a range of only 17 degrees Fahr. between average summer and
winter weather. Snow and biting cold are alike unknown, and artificial heating is little needed ; while an
occasional hot day in summer brings its own remedy in the shape of a “southerly buster” of cool wind, which
sweeps along the coast, laden with the freshness of the southern ocean.
Great as .Sydney has become as the leading commercial centre of Australia, it may with justice be regarded
as a holiday city. Magnificent ocean beaches fringe the metropolis along the Pacific littoral, to which Sydney
residents repair in thousands to enjoy the delightful sport of surf-bathing in the “ long wash of Australasian
seas.” Within twenty miles to the north and south lie the two great national forest reserves of Kuring-gai Chase
and National Park, each including nearly 35,000 acres, forming glorious recreation spaces for Sydney’s citizens.
The superb climate, which makes open-air life enjoyable at every season of the year, causes these splendid
natural facilities to be availed of to the full. The magnificent gorges and leaping waterfalls of the Blue Mountains,
at an elevation of over 3,000 feet, are only 60 miles west of the metropolis, and provide a complete change of
climate and scene at the cost of a couple of hours’ train journey. All the State railways radiate from Sydney,
which is, from its position, the natural tourist centre of Australia.
Persons who are interested in this great city of the Southern Seas, or in the industrial, commercial, and
tourist possibilities of the State of which it is the capital, may obtain full information from the New South Wales
Immigration and Tourist Bureau, with offices in Challis House, Sydney.
