PREFACE.
S a reason is invariably sought for the projecting of any
special object, I may at once proceed to lay before my
reader the end and aim of this work. It will be asserted
that abundance of literature of a similar nature is already
in the market, which I grant; but seeing that an intending emigrant
has to peruse as many, and more, publications than there are colonies—
and this of course at a cost to himself of as many shillings—before
he can acquire a knowledge of the most suitable spot upon which to
fix his hopes, my idea is to render the information more easily obtainable
by comprehending the most important elements of each colony into
one volume, leaving it of course to the option of the reader to further
satisfy his mind as to one or all of the colonies by purchasing more
extended dissertations thereon.
As to the advisability or otherwise of emigration little need be said
here; but sufficient is known by any man moving amongst the great
middle and working class population of the country in proof that on
all hands the labour market is vastly overstocked, and as a result the
competition so keen that employers and employed alike suffer.
Then as to my personal advocacy of the subject. During the past
winter months, and indeed in those preceding, conferences were held
in the Homerton Evangelical Hall with a view of ascertaining the
practicability of such a scheme, and also as to the feelings of the
people thereon. As may probably be remembered from the reports
given in the London “ dailies,” the conference was eminently suc-
cessful, it being surprising to many of us how eager the middle and
working classes were to obtain information of the “sunny climes
beyond,” in which they cherished vague ideas of one day enjoying a
greater amount of worldly prosperity than was their present lot. At
this conference also several gentlemen of large practical colonial


experience delivered addresses on the advantages of the various
colonies visited by them, and the statement by a captain of an
emigrant ship that, from enquiries he had from time to time made,
out of a total of 600 persons he had conveyed to Adelaide hut three
had failed to succeed (with other statements of a similar nature),
fairly aroused the sympathies of the audiences. At the final meeting
a committee was formed to seek all necessary information, the result
of which, together with extracts culled from various authorities, is
here presented. I may add that the reports of the conferences brought
enquiries from all parts of London and the provinces, from persons
anxious to be reliably informed as to their adaptability for emigrating,
which was ample evidence of the inclinations of the people to better
their conditions if possible.
One point to which I especially wish to allude is the desirability of
trade societies taking up the emigration question, and assisting those
from their ranks who are willing to try their fortunes in the colonies
in doing so. From my personal knowledge of working men through-
out the country, by reason of my connection with Working Men’s
Clubs and Institutes, and also my position as Director of the
London Samaritan Society, which is the means of giving from 90,000
to 100,000 free meals each winter to the destitute poor of the
metropolis, I am convinced that no better expenditure of trade society
funds could be adopted, inasmuch as by a judicious thinning of the
artisan ranks a great amount of competition would be abolished, and
the employe be enabled to hold a more appreciated position in his
workshop than is in many instances, unfortunately, the case at
present.
Sufficient, I think, has been here stated by way of apology for
the work and in recommendation of its objects, and I leave it with
the hope that it will be productive of the good results intended.

Arrangements have been made for obtaining newspapers, corre-
spondence, and other reliable information from the various countries
and colonies herein mentioned, and this will from time to time be
published in pamphlet form at as small a cost as possible.


OPENINGS FOR EMIGRANTS.
T has been my chief aim to speak of as many of the
emigrant stations as are reasonably supposed to possess
advantages, and to give in as concise a form as possible
all the most essential points of interest. I shall therefore
review, so far as present researches admit, the climate,
work and wages, cost of living, the proportionate quality and price of
land, and give various experiences of reliable, practical men, who
have gone out with little capital, hut plenty of energy, and returned
with, or forwarded proofs of, a success which is attained but by few
amongst the heavily-handicapped workmen in our own country.
The United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Queensland,
Tasmania, South Africa, are amongst the places set down, and I will
commence by a reference to
NEW ZEALAND.
The geographical description of this country is, that it is about
1,200 miles long, and 120 miles wide, and at no point is the land
more than 75 miles from the sea. Lying nearly due north and south,
it embraces nearly 12° of latitude. Its northerly point is in about
latitude 34°, whilst its extreme south is in latitude 46°. Thus its
climate is in a great degree favourable to growth of all descriptions.
The average rainfall is moderate, and the permanent supplies of water
are bountiful by reason of the many rivers, brooks, and springs to be
found on all hands. The climate indeed is so much like that of
England [sans, happily, the many sudden changes), that it causes no
great revulsion in a man’s constitution to settle there. The extremes
of the English winter are absent here, there being scarcely any ice
observable even in the very coldest day experienced; and in further
proof of this I have the testimony of a twelve years’ resident, who
says he never saw ice in New Zealand sufficiently strong to bear a
child’s weight. This state of things, as far as snow and ice are con-
cerned, almost altogether applies to the south; but yet it is rarely
that the Southerners experience any long duration of such weather.
So equable is the temperature that the cattle are never at any portion


of the year taken from the open pasture; and whilst, in the absence
of anything like heavy snow or hail in the winter, there is a short
season of rain, one great blessing exists in the non-appearance of fog
of any kind. As a rule, the wintry days are clear and bright, and
the air bracing.
It is computed that New Zealand is the healthiest country in the
world. All kinds of fruits (English) will grow there, and many rich
natural specimens are found in great abundance. Figs, peaches, and
apricots are characteristics, and some of the crops of these fruits are
so plentiful that the cattle are fed with them. Even oranges and
lemons can he cultivated in parts of the country, as also can tobacco
and hops; but as yet little attention has been given to their pro-
duction.
Such is the climate of New Zealand; and now I pass on to
WORK, WAGES, AND COST OF LIVING,
about which the Eev. J. Berry, in his interesting work on this colony,
remarks: “ The white population of New Zealand numbers about
420,000. About half this number are in towns and cities, and the
rest are scattered in country districts, and engaged chiefly in agricul-
ture. The four principal cities of New Zealand contain, with their
suburbs, about 25,000 inhabitants each. These are Auckland, Wel-
lington, Christchurch, and Dunedin. There are about fifteen towns,
containing from 3,000 to 5,000 people each. Besides these there are
scores of villages or, as we call them there, townships. The cities of
New Zealand are very beautiful. Town halls, banks, museums, post-
offices, &c., often present striking features of street architecture. In
some cities and towns cabs are not only more numerous than in towns
of the same size at home, but much more handsome. In Wellington
a steam tram traverses the city daily, carrying passengers between suburbs
on opposite sides for a fare of threepence. All ordinary professions, as
lawyers, doctors, &c., are there, and mechanics of every kind are busy.
There are engineering firms, tanneries, boot and carriage factories, and
woollen mills. One wholesale clothing factory employs 600 hands,
and a woodware firm finds work for 1,300. There are biscuit and
flour-mills, brickyards, and agricultural implement works; immense
saw-mills, large cabinet-making and building concerns. There are, of
course, cheese and meat curing, glue and soap factories, ink and
blacking, and even cod-liver oil works. At the shops and warehouses
nearly everything which one can possibly want is on sale. Then of
course the coal, gold, and silver mines employ an immense number of
hands, so that no man of any ordinary trade or profession need fear
that he may not find employment there.”
It may be generally accepted, the same authority says, that wages
range from two to three times more than those current in England,
which may be gleaned from the following list made by a competent
government official specially appointed for the purpose :

In several important branches of trade—viz., shoemakers, tailors,
coach-builders, brewers, painters, &c.—no reliable returns are published;
but the before-mentioned authority, from personal observation on the
subject, has the impression that they range from £2 10s. to £6 per
week. It is not, however, he says, a very good field for clerks, unless
they be men of more than average ability. With regard to the ques-
tion of the probability of wages decreasing, Mr. Berry says : “ There
need not be any fear of wages in New Zealand becoming lower for
some time, at least. During my residence there the population has
doubled, yet wages are twenty to thirty per cent, higher than when I
knew New Zealand first. The labourer so soon becomes a farmer, and
the mechanic an employer, that all our experience so far goes to show
that the more labour we absorb the more we need. Wages were never
so high in my experience as during the last harvest. This must be
the case in a country which so teems with resources, and which is
under-populated. The ratio of the wealth of the people increases
more rapidly than their numbers.”
Teachers, too, are well paid in New Zealand; the Board school-
masters averaging from £2OO to £350 per year.
Much stress is laid upon the advantages for female emigration,
inasmuch as the returns show but seventy-five females to one hundred
males; therefore useful women of every kind are much in demand for
domestic work. This latter class of servitors can readily obtain £3O
to £4O a year, whilst washerwomen get from 4s. to ss. per day; and
it is also said that “ a father, with a family of working girls, would do
them invaluable service by taking them to the colony, it being need-
less to point out the capital opportunities a girl has for marrying in a
country where young men do so well, and young women are in a
minority. ”
As will be seen from a preceding page, provisions are very
cheap; but as regards clothing a higher sum is asked, this being
attributable to the scarcity of appliances as in use in the home
country. Working men’s clothes and boots manufactured in New
Zealand cost about twenty-five per cent, more than in England; be-
spoke clothes fifty to seventy-five per cent. more. House rent is dear
there; men will not build houses to let to pay less than about twelve per
cent, profit. But by the help of building societies, which abound in
the colony, an industrious man can soon secure his own house. Three-
fourths of the occupiers of an acre and upwards own the property
they occupy.
If a settler is provident he may soon save money, and if inclined
to lend it out at interest, can readily obtain nine and ten per cent, for
it. It is no matter for wonder that the statement is made that
colonists are proverbially hospitable, or that new arrivals soon make
friends, inasmuch as most of them having previously gone out
from the old country, feel insensibly drawn to the new arrival. New
Zealand is in fact, on all hands, thoroughly English to the core. There
are everywhere churches and schools. All the ordinary societies
are transplanted. Freemasons, Odd Fellows, Good Templars, Orange-


men, and kindred institutions are represented in most of the towns
and villages. There are many capital working men’s clubs. Most of
the smaller towns, in the South Island especially, have good lending
libraries and reading-rooms. With a population not larger than that
of Manchester and Salford, there are 111 newspapers; and the leading
English papers and magazines go out by every mail, and lie on the
tables of the reading-rooms a few weeks after date of publication.
Important European news is telegraphed to New Zealand, and is in
circulation throughout the colony in a couple of days.
As to the
LAND, ITS PRICE AND QUALITY,
It is stated that, although there are millions of acres uncultivated,
it is a popular error to believe that farming is the only lucrative
occupation in New Zealand. The population of nearly half a million
is distributed into almost as many trades and professions as are in
operation in England. The abundance of coal, iron, gold, and other
minerals is rapidly leading to the development of manufacturing
industries, and must continue to do so. Still, agriculturists are in the
greatest demand, and the prospects which it presents to such can
scarcely be exaggerated. Emigration, it has been said, and I think
rightly said, is the best way of relieving the distressed agriculture of
England. “ Rents must be reduced, and that quickly, or we shall
have wide-spread ruin amongst the farmers.” The natural way there-
fore of reducing rent is to diminish competition for farms, and
emigration is the way to effect this. Uncultivated land can be bought
in nearly any part of New Zealand. Really good land costs from £3
to £8 per acre. Inferior land in lonely parts of the colony may often
be bought much cheaper; but this would not suit the class for whom
I write. Unimproved land may be bought from private owners in
almost any part of New Zealand at the above prices. These owners
are in many cases capitalists who bought land many years ago at a few
shillings per acre, and have held it until, by increase of population
and developments of roads and railways, it has become valuable.
Unimproved land is, however, mostly in the hands of the New
Zealand Government. The Government, having bought from the
natives and surveyed into blocks, sells to intending settlers at a profit.
This profit is expended in surveying, forming roads, building bridges,
and developing the country. Every possible facility is offered to the
intending purchaser. This land is divided into pastoral and agricul-
tural blocks. Pastoral land is sold by auction, at an upset of £1 per
acre, the purchaser paying an instalment at the time, and the balance
in thirty half-yearly payments. The agricultural land is open for
selection, at £2 per acre upset price, in blocks of 320 acres. The
selector may have ten years to pay for his land, in which case fifty
per cent, is added to cover the interest for this term. Such a selector
must reside on his land, and improve it; this is the condition on
which the title is granted. Thus will be seen the immense advantage
which this offers to the hand fide farmer with limited capital.

Another common error with regard to the land in New Zealand is,
that it is covered with standing timber. There is not too mnch forest
land; but a settler can purchase a plot of such if he so chooses, and
with the aid of the many large saw-mills in operation in close con-
tiguity to the bush, make capital out of prepared timber by selling it
for firewood, &c. A purchaser of a plot of ordinary land, if he be
energetic and have a little capital, can soon add to his resources, as he
can sow grass both in spring and autumn. In quality and natural
features the land in New Zealand varies. Some is light, with gravelly
subsoil, and especially adapted to grass and clover; many of the wide
lands are rich alluvial soil, and in some parts it is deep and rich.
Young farmers are rather advised to accept situations on first entering
the country than on straightway purchasing, as by the former they can
gain experience prior to farming on their own account. The land is
very productive, the following tabulated statement, as prepared by Mr.
Giffen for the Board of Trade, being given in proof :

The subjoined extracts from a paper read by Sir Julius Vogel,
before the Colonial Institute, in March, 1878, may be interesting, as
corroborative of the facts already adduced :
‘‘ My own conviction is that a much greater rise in the value of good freehold
land in New Zealand is certain to take place, and this at a much earlier period
than you in the colony or the public generally have any conception of. In looking
into the agricultural returns of Great Britain, with abstract returns for the United
Kingdom, British possessions, and foreign countries, for 1876, I find that the
average yield of wheat per acre in New Zealand, out of the 90,804 acres under
this crop for 1875-6, was 315 bushels, while in Victoria, with its 321,401 acres,
the average yield for the same year was only 15‘5 bushels per acre; New South


Wales, with 133,610 acres, was 147; South Australia, with 898,820 acres, was
11-8; Tasmania, with 42,745 acres, 16 4 ; Natal, with 1,740 acres, was 12’6 ;
and Cape of Good Hope, with 188,000 acres, was B’9. Dominion of Canada, for
1871, the latest date given, the average of the Lake Ontario district is 6'4 ;
Quebec, B's ; New Brunswick, 10'8 ; Nova Scotia, lUB. Then if we turn to the
United States, the great competitor, so to speak, for the population of Europe,
the average yield of wheat for 1874, the latest date given, is 12‘3 bushels per
acre, and the United Kingdom, in which the best of the land only is cultivated
for wheat, and this highly cultivated and manured, only yields an average of
27£ bushels per acre. You will easily see that when it comes to be generally
known and understood in the United Kingdom and Europe, as well as in
Australia and America, that the returns to an agriculturist are so superior in
New Zealand to those in other countries, and this with a climate relatively
superior, their attention will naturally, and as a matter of course, be concentrated
upon New Zealand. If you only put down the cost of ploughing, seed harrowing,
reaping, thrashing, and carting to port, all of which may be said to be nearly
the same in the several countries (reaping and thrashing alone excepted in
Australia and California, where, I understand, it is done by a special method,
with the straw left standing on the field), and deduct these charges from the
returns the grain would yield, say at ss. per bushel all round at shipping port,
you will find the immense advantage in the shape of returns to the agriculturist
in New Zealand from any of the Australian Colonies, the Cape, or America. In
this I do not deal with Europe, as in the countries where the yield is great the
land is not only highly cultivated, but heavily manured. Then, when you take
into consideration the fact that in all Australia the land may be said, after being
cropped, to be left in an unproductive form, and allowed to revert to its natural
state —no permanent pasture of an artificial character (viz., English grass) is given
for Adelaide in 1876, and only 19,260 acres for 1875 ; for New South Wales none
stated; for Victoria, out of 1,126,000 as under crops and grass, only 293,000
acres is given as under artificial grass ; for Western Australia and Queensland
none given ; and for Tasmania (the most favoured for this of all the Australian
Colonies), out of 332,000 acres, only 102,000 is given, or under one-third of the
whole; whereas in New Zealand, out of 2,377,000 acres, not less than 1,770,000
acres is given as sown out in permanent artificial grass. For Natal and the Cape,
none. For Canada none stated; but I have no doubt, both in it and the United
States (viz., the Atlantic) a relative proportion to New Zealand will also be sown out
in English grass ; but, on the other hand, they have a six-months’ winter, when
the ground is wholly covered with snow, and when there may be said to be no
outside feed for cattle and sheep. So far as I can make out, all that can be said
of small agriculturists in Canada, the States, or in any of the Australian
Colonies, the yield of wheat per acre, or the returns therefrom, will only pay the
farmer fair wages for his own labour, or in some cases yield him probably 10s. to
20s. per acre beyond this; whereas in New Zealand, with the climate much more
pleasant to work in than any of the others, the farmer, after allowing himself
wages at the same rate as in the other colonies for self, family, and horses (viz.,
manual and horse labour), would have from £4 to £4 15s. per acre net returns,
instead of 10s. to 205., as in the others. Then, after the land is cropped and
sown out in English grass, the yield in feed for sheep is four to five times (viz.,
equal to 20s. per acre of yearly wool return) what it was previous to being
broken up and laid down in English grass, instead of (in Australia at least)
yielding less returns in pasturage than it did in its natural state,
“You will thus easily see how much better it will be for a man to pay £lO per
acre, ay, even £2O per acre, for good land in New Zealand, than £1 to £2 per
acre for fair land in Australia. The cultivation of 20 acres of good land in
Australia (I mean the labour, and ploughing, sowing, harrowing, and reaping,
thrashing, carting to port, &c.) cannot be put down with safety at under
close upon £3 per acre, basing my estimate upon the current rate of manual
and horse labour in the several colonies. The returns from the wheat crop in
these colonies will not yield ss. per acre over this sum one year with another,
whereas the returns from New Zealand will yield £4 in excess of this. As before
stated, I am taking the wheat all round at ss. per bushel at the shipping port in


the several colonies in this statement. From the foregoing it will be seen that
the net return from wheat to the landowner, after paying £3 per acre for the
manual and horse labour, is fifteen times more in New Zealand than Australia
and for the United States ; and for years after the land has been cropped in
Australia it will yield next to nothing, until the natural grass again springs up
and gets a sale, when two or three acres must go for each sheep; whereas in New
Zealand one acre of good English grass will keep four to five merino sheep, and
for three cross-breeds, over the year. I daresay, when you have all the foregoing
weighed over and thought out, you will conclude with me that at no distant
date good agricultural land will be selling at £lO to £ls per acre in New
Zealand, according to quality and locality, and A 1 agricultural land at from £2O
to £25 per acre.
“In the returns on profit of one acre in New Zealand of wheat against 15 or
20 acres, as the case may be, in Australia or America—viz., the net returns after
payment or allowance for labour, seed, &c.—l omitted one very important item
of outlay; viz., the fencing of one acre, say, in New Zealand, as against from 15
to 20 acres, and the maintaining of said fences. I doubt not you will concur with
me in the rapid and permanent increase in value that must necessarily take place
on agricultural land in New Zealand when once the facts as already stated are
known and generally recognized. ”
Another gentleman, a large landowner in the colony, and enjoying
exceptional opportunities of acquiring information, affirms :
“A great deal of land will yield two grain crops in succession, and after a
green crop eaten on the land yield two more grain crops, and so on, continuing to
give two grain crops in succession for one green crop, without any signs of failure.
This can be done upon the best agricultural land in the Middle Island, of which
there is a large area.”
New Zealand, independently of being an attractive place for
mechanics, domestic servants, and others mentioned, is also a fine field
for the capitalist, it being indeed a matter for wonder that more of
the money (for which in England there is often no good investment)
does not find its way to the colonies. The banks in New Zealand pay
five and a half to six per cent, to depositors for six or twelve months ;
and money can he lent on mortgage, with the best of security, at
seven to ten per cent.
“ In estimating the profits of the New Zealand farmer,” Mr. Berry’s
hook says, “ something must he deducted to allow for the very high
rate of wages ruling there, the average wages to a farm labourer being
about one shilling per hour. But for the New Zealand climate this
would he a very heavy weight in the other scale. The labour market
and the climate must, however, he considered together, because, as
every farmer knows, the climate has so much to do with the amount
of labour which a farm needs. The absence of the long, dreary
English winter reduces to an extent, which cannot easily be over-
estimated, the amount of labour which a New Zealand farm demands.
Where grass grows most of the winter, and horses, cattle, and sheep
live in the open air all the year round, very little provision is needed
for winter. This takes away the necessity for half the labour required
on an English farm. Again, horses are cheap there, and easily kept;
and if we couple the ploughman with his team, the whole put together
do not cost more probably than in England. Much labour is saved by
the little extent to which manure is used; and some, I regret to say,


by a rough-and-ready style of agriculture, which is under the circum-
stances inevitable. There can be no doubt, too, that the New Zealand
farmer does more manual labour than is usual in England ; and it is
such a man who reaps the full benefit of the colonial advantages. In
proportion to the price of wages is the value of the labour of the
farmer and his sons. A man who has little heart to do a day’s ploughing
when he sees only half-a-crown at the end of it, feels very differently
when he can in this way earn eight or ten shillings. We thus solve
the labour difficulty by learning to help ourselves.”
Another author, Mr. Arthur Claydon, speaking on the same subject,
says : “ Thousands of our young farmers should take their capital
and skill to New Zealand, and, buying out the poor farmers who are
scratching over their labour-starved acres, and getting a bushel of corn
where they might take a sack, show what may be done amid such
matchless natural advantages. At Nelson, for instance, a district
generally pooh-poohed by the inhabitants of Canterbury or Otago, I
could point out farms by the score which might be bought for from
,£SOO to £2,000. Knowing people on the spot will tell you that the
land is poor; but it is not the land but the farming which is at fault.
Of the myriads of acres of hill and vale lying idle all along the
Nelson district I do not believe there is an acre which might not be
made to yield either grass, or corn, or fruit. With a little pains and
enterprise vast orchards might be developed all around. I have seen
scores of cherry-trees which never had a care bestowed upon them,
wild growths of the soil, laden with delicious fruit —fruit which, if
sent to the English market in some preserved condition, would find a
ready welcome. Where a hundredweight is now grown, a thousand
tons might soon be grown. What a field for English market-gardeners!
Eancy wild peaches growing in such profusion that pigs are fed upon
them!”
It may be said, in concluding the present subject, that there is no
room here, as in other places, for the lazy or incompetent person; it
being very pointedly put in one work on New Zealand that there are
hospitals for the sick, asylums for the insane, and charitable aids for
widows and .orphans where necessary, but that there are no parish
unions, and no likelihood of their being established.
QUEENSLAND.
Which is a thriving young colony in the north-eastern corner of
Australia, also comes within the category of attractive spots for the
emigrant, and presents more than average advantages to the agricul-
turist by reason of its very excellent soil and climate, and also the
absence of a too great competition. Indeed a capitalist would have
every opportunity of amassing wealth, as the soil and climate are
capable of producing a greater range of articles than any other colony
in the empire. Then again, being of dimensions described as “a


dozen Englands,” with a population of only a third-rate English town,
there is no need for fear —at least for the next ten or a dozen decades
—of the place becoming over-populated. Valuable veins of copper and
gold have been discovered, and tin and coal are discovered at almost
every excavation. Sugar-cane cultivation has also been found to he
a most remunerative occupation. Mr. James Bon wick, f.r.g.s., in his
work on this colony, sums up its advantages in a few well-chosen
sentences, viz.: “ British in manners, wholesome in climate, pic-
turesque in scenery, abundant in fruits, cheap in living, and hopeful
in its future, Queensland cannot fail to draw attention to its claims.
Colonies are true retreats for the worn and weary of Europe, as they
give a fresh start on a fairer field; but they are especially open to the
young and ardent, thwarted and repelled in the crowded marts of
old countries. To both these classes Queensland gives a hearty
welcome.
The resources of the colony are great. Eacilities for trade are
afforded by harbours, and by contiguity to other lands; and its
physical features are important in relation to production. There are
several ranges of hills, which affect the climate to a yery appreciable
extent. The rain-laden clouds bring moisture to the coast lands, but
have little left when they get over the ranges; and thus it is that the
w r est and south-west are dry, whilst the other parts are well watered.
The dimensions of the colony are 1,300 miles in length, and 1,000
miles broad, the area being 669,520 square miles, or 430,500,000
acres.
The mineral wealth of the colony is incalculable, and it is open
still to the tread of the adventurous pioneer. There is plenty of
room for new stations to be formed. No other colony in the south
has so many vacant spaces of suitable land to be filled up; none can
afford to be so liberal in the treatment of new-comers looking for
pastoral occupations. The land is supplied on such easy leasing terms
as less than one farthing an acre in many quarters, with a secure
tenure for a number of years, and easy conditions for beginners as to
the minimum rate of stocking, to allow time for natural increase
rather than compel a large outlay at first.
In explaining the means whereby to acquire land Mr. Bonwick
says : “To obtain a Run in the first instance, the applicant secures
from the Commissioners of the district an Occupation License for one
year, previously forwarding the rent, and complying with the stock
regulations, by which he must put on one-fourth the amount of stock
the officer deems the run calculated to carry as a minimum, to he
placed on the ground within six months. This is to make the appli-
cation hona-fide. The area is surveyed by Government, and paid for
by the applicant. The limit is from twenty-five to one hundred
square miles, the length never exceeding three times the width, to
check the securing of an excess of frontage to a stream. Supposing
there are several applicants for the same space, an auction competition
at the upset rental settles all disputes. Any one can learn at the
Commissioner’s office what lands are applied for, and where. Several


Rum may be secured by the same party should there be no opposition,
provided they be adjacent, and not exceeding a total of 200 square
miles, or only 128,000 acres (!) in the Consolidated Ran. At the end
of the year a full Lease is granted for twenty-one years. For the
first seven years the demand is five shillings a square mile, less than
half a farthing rent an acre; for the second seven it is ten shillings;
and for the third fifteen. As the Run may seem more valuable or
less, both parties to the contract, Government and lessee, have the
liberty at the termination of the first or second term of seven years
to ask for an appraisement as a new adjustment. But it is arranged
that the alteration shall not bring the rent lower than seven shillings,
or higher than fifteen, for the second term, and not less than twelve,
nor more than twenty-five, during the third seven years. Each run
must carry at least twenty head of cattle, or one hundred sheep, per
square mile. There are also Umcatered Runs on easier terms. These
must be at least five miles from permanent water. On such the
limitation stock condition is not enforced, and the rental is but three
shillings a mile, about a quarter of a farthing an acre. But it is only
on an annual license. Advantage could be taken of means for the
storage of water during seasons of rain. In the west the richest
pastures are often dry. Leases can be transferred by permission of
the authorities. The cost of survey can never exceed six shillings
per square mile. If the rent be delayed in payment for three months,
twenty-five per cent is added to the charge; if not paid then, the
lease is forfeited, and submitted to public competition at auction.
Should the squatter, by improvements, wish to secure himself, he can
purchase a block of 2,500 acres at the upset price of ten shillings an
acre. To protect a lessee from unnecessary trespass, no one can travel
across the run of another without moving straight forward, and at the
rate of four miles a day with sheep, or six with cattle and horses.
Many are compelled to travel with stock when their own feed at
home is destroyed by drought. Xo area is ever resumed by Govern-
ment without payment for improvements. In looking out for a run,
a man is guided by several questions. The better his selection of an
area the more fortunate he is. Some shrewd fellows of an enter-
prising turn devote themselves to the discovery business. They
explore, secure the license, and then dispose of their right to those of
less ardour and capacity, but more cash. Government parties, as well
as private adventurers, go on exploratory expeditions.”
The Darling Downs district is spoken of as the “ garden of Queens-
land,” the elevation—l,ooo to 2,000 feet—atfording delicious airs,
and a better chance of a rainfall With railway connection with the
capital, with the most agreeable latitudes, with townships abundant
in civilized conveniences, with the best conducted stations and farms,
with coal-fields, tin mines, and gold workings, this district might well
be praised.

The last official returns give a report at the beginning of 1879. A
decided improvement in the prices had occurred in the settled districts.
Leases whose time had expired were renewed at seven or eight times
the original rental, to the gain of the Government owner. An advance
appeared, too, in the unsettled districts, whose average rentals came to
10s. 3d. per square mile, or three-fourths of a farthing per acre. But
the difference indicates the relative squatting value. Thus, the rent
was only 3s. in the distant and new North Gregory, but 18s. ll|d.
in Darling Downs. The intermediate rates were, South Gregory,
4s. 6£d.; Burke, 6s. Bd.; Cook, 7s, 4d.; Mitchell, 10s. IOJd.;
Warrego, 12s. 7|d. ; Burnett, 16s. Bd.; South Kennedy, 16s. 9|d.;
North Kennedy, 16s. ll^d.; Leichhardt, 17s. 3|d.; and Maranoa,
17s. 4£d.
In the Land Act of 1868, subsequently slightly altered, three
classes of land are specified, with three upset prices; viz. agricultural ,
15s. an acre; first-class pastoral, 10s. ; second-class pastoral, ss. One
selecting his portion can distribute payments over ten years, giving
eighteen-pence an acre annually for the best, twelve-pence for the
next, and sixpence for the poorest. He may have from 40 to 640
acres of the first, 80 to 2,560 of the second, and 80 to 5,120 of the
third. He must pay Government for the survey of the portion he
selects, and reside on the allotment in person or by bailiff ; if proving
that one-tenth of his land is under cultivation, the condition of resi-
dence is not enforced. But his outlay in improvements during three
years must average 10s. an acre for the best land, and ss. for the
other. After three years he can obtain a certificate, which enables
him to dispose of his interest in the farm; and, if he pleases, he may
then pay the balance of purchase and secure his Crown grant as a
freehold. When taking up pastoral land on conditional purchase, he
is required to stock it at the rate of twenty cattle or fifty sheep for
every hundred acres, till the selection be fenced. This is for the
security of the neighbouring squatter. In 1878 33,000,000 acres were
open to selection, and others will be ready as pastoral leases fall in.
No minor nor unmarried woman can select.
The timber resources of the country rank high. Queensland has
enormous forests toward the coast and upon the uplands. As in all
colonies, there has been a reckless destruction of trees by the settlers,
whether miners, farmers, or squatters. Even timber-cutters themselves,
though working under Government license, paying a trifling rent, are
mischievous agents in their ignorant and indiscriminate slaughter of
forest ornaments. Still, with all the waste, there has not been so
much mischief done as in some neighbouring settlements. Forest
culture is popular in Australia, where streets are being lined with
trees. State nurseries are being formed, so as to supply settlers with
saplings of useful shrubs and trees, and plantations are also being formed
on hill slopes denuded of their natural clothing.
From the revelations of most recent explorers, with respect to
Western Queensland, especially from the discoveries of squatters in
search of new runs, much hope of future successes is to be obtained.


When 500 miles of a river, once thought to pass through a desert, is
found to go only through rich black soil, covered with good grass,
faith in Western Queensland is well sustained.
The present amount of stock in the west, however, is no guide to
what it may carry. There was a time when 40,000 sheep was thought
too heavy for the Peak Downs, now holding 250,000 on one station
alone up there. In the west the Barcoo country itself has fifty times
the area of the Peak Downs, saying nothing of the Diamantina, the
Mulligan, and the Herbert. As to water, it may be had by storing;
and it can be found by digging. Artesian wells will remove many
difficulties. The grasses are the most important question to the
pastoral tenant. Absolutely dependent, almost everywhere, upon the
indigenous supply, the native growth, he has sought anxiously for
information on the feed. Thanks to a colonial government, raised
from among the people, by the people, and for the good of the people,
State offices have been rendered. There are good botanists, like Mr.
Walter Hill, to collect grasses, and test them in the various botanic
gardens, furnishing good official reports for public instruction.
The colony in many places produces good substitutes for grass,
which are said to be most nutritious for both sheep and cattle. The
causes of failure of the grass crops in some of the older districts are
attributed to injudicious management of the ground. Sheep have
been allowed to bite too closely, thus destroying the plant; whilst
seeds have not been allowed to grow and mature. In some districts
what are known as the poison plants are found, but only on very rare
occasions. Diseases of stock, always an important feature to the
agriculturist, are not so serious as in the old country. The scab is
absolutely unknown on Queensland grasses. An occasional epidemic
of catarrh has passed through the colonies. English affections have
been long kept at a distance by rigid exclusion. Recently the im-
portation of British stock has been sanctioned in Queensland, but
subject to very careful quarantine in Moreton Bay, on St. Helena Isle
there, during ninety days. This arrests the foot and mouth disease.
Cattle near the coast have been known to be troubled with rheu-
matism, and others with swollen throats. Horses that suffer from
swamp cancer are hurried off to the salt-bush. Grass seeds sometimes
affect the eyes of horses. The hyatids, or cysts in the liver, come in
a flooded country. Root rot may attend travelling sheep ; after paring,
the treatment is with arsenic or warm tar. The fluke is mostly con-
fined to certain districts, or to growing seasons, the old suffering the
most. Small worms are a nuisance to sheep; though unknown in the
salt-bush regions, the overtaxing of pasturage, and neglect of salt,
may develope the worms.
Of the various industries the wool trade may be said to be a
prosperous one, though the fluctuations in prices are trying to the
squatter. In 1872 a very light yield realized the splendid return of
£2,635,026, though falling to £1,499,682 in 1877. The rates of
1879 mean millions of pounds profit to the Australian sheep farmer.
It is only by taking the mean of several years that the paying circum-

stances become apparent. jSTo wise squatter depends upon one season,
nor risks his capital for a single year. A succession of bad seasons
alternate with good ones, as high prices alternate with low ones. The
prudent prepare for a storm, and the better enjoy the fair weather.
Above all things, they keep out of debt to banker or merchant, and
buy cheaper, while selling in the open market, instead of all transac-
tions going through the hands of creditors.

Passing from the pastoral to the more strictly agricultural, it may
be said that Queensland, more than any other colony, has three
distinct areas of cultivation—these are the Tropical, the Temperate,
and the Inter-Tropical regions, from which the agriculturist may
take his selection. The tropical would include the rich alluvial flats
towards the coast, and the lower lands of the northern interior. The
temperate section comprehends primarily the elevated Darling Downs,
the mountain valleys giving birth to streams, and some of the higher
lands of the tropics themselves. The inter-tropical would be the
intermediate kind found in the Moreton district, the Wide Bay and
Burnett district, and many fertile parts of Leichhardt, Kennedy, and
Port Curtis districts, and of course the settler would chose his par-
ticular spot with a due attention to his intentions in trade. When
the soil is sufficiently deep all the mineral elements required by the


ordinary agricultural products raised in (Queensland are present in
abundance.
An analysis of soils from south-eastern Queensland as given by
Mr. Mechi may be interesting. He says : “ The best Scrub-soil of
Albert river yielded water, 5"994; organic matters, 10"623; clay,
81-723; line sand, 1-660. The nitrogen was ‘457, equal to -554 of
ammonia. The soluble in water were —organic matters, T 52 ; oxide of
iron and alumina, *051; lime, "057; magnesia, "029; alkalies, "057 ;
and silica, -101. The soluble in acid gave organic matters, 10-623;
oxide of iron, 6-937 ; alumina, 7-021; lime, 1-259 ; magnesia, D 04 3;
potash, -453; soda, -119 ; phosphoric acid, -301; soluble silica, 8-912 ;
insoluble silicious matter, 53-281. The best forest soil of Albert river
brought water, 6‘705 ; organic matters, 11-834; clay, 78-456; line
sand, 3-005. The nitrogen was -343, equal to -416 of ammonia. The
soluble in water were organic matters, -193; oxides of iron and
alumina, -086 ; lime, -035 ; magnesia, -021; alkalies, -027; silica, -137.
The soluble in acid were —organic matters, 11 - 834; oxide of iron,
8-369; alumina, 11-270; lime, -522; magnesia, -302; potash, -269 ;
soda, -317; phosphoric acid, -221; soluble silica, 4-377 ; insoluble
silicious matter, 50-822. The best soils of Darling Downs and
More ton are sought for because of facilities of carriage and their
proximity to consumers. But abundance of good ground, every way
suitable to cultivators, is known further up the country, and will be
utilized as population spreads, especially in the neighbourhood of the
mines. The Chinese, economical and skilful, have made handsome
profits by growing vegetables, especially the welcome Chinese cabbage,
for gold-diggers in the mountain gullies, though in genuine tropical
latitudes and in supposed unlikely quarters. But such places as the
Peak Downs, where the soil has been found sixty feet deep, cannot
fail to attract farmers some day.”
The productive capabilities of the colony extend, amongst vege-
tables, to potatoes, cabbages, cauliflowers, beans, peas, lettuces, leeks,
celery, parsnips, beet, carrots, onions, pumpkins, and melons; besides
those not raised in Britain, as sweet potatoes, cassava, &c. As to
fruits, Queensland has apples, pears, plums, cherries, gooseberries,
currants, strawberries, raspberries, quinces, mulberries, almonds, grapes,
peaches, and nectarines; and a further supply of oranges, lemons, figs,
olives, pomegranates, citrons, guavas, jack fruit, passion fruit, bananas,
pine-apples, &c. Corn, tobacco, tapioca, arrowroot, sorghum, tea, coffee,
sugar, rice, vanilla, pepper, turmeric, ginger, spices, indigo, cotton, and
opium can also be successfully produced.
Maize is the great crop of Queensland, as it is in Hew South Wales.
In 1871 there were 20,329 acres of it, but in 1878 it had increased to
53,799, the yield being 1,539,510 bushels. Other corn is less popular,
or deemed less remunerative. Barley, which does so well in Hew
Zealand, a colder clime, was only grown on 1,065 acres, yielding
16,904 bushels in a dry season. Oats are cultivated mainly for hay,
or as green food for cattle. Thus 4,772 acres were in for hay, 869 for
cattle, but merely 132 for grain, giving 1,274 bushels. Rye, though


lately but 137 acres, seems likely, by the appeals of the energetic
Dr. Bancroft, to become more popular in Queensland, as it resists the
rust, and makes capital fodder. Of the barley 839 acres were in
Toowoomba, 1,800 feet above the sea-level. Of the maize, suitable
for Darling Downs as well as the Lower Moreton and Burnett, 12,391
acres were about Ipswich of Moreton; 7,122 about Bundaberg of
Burnett; 5,437 about Brisbane; 6,167, Toowoomba; and 4,503,
Warwick and Allora. Potatoes cannot be said to be a failure there,
when in a recent unfortunate season 3,882 acres grew 9,063 tons.
Moisture and cooler places suit the root better. It is, however, a
noticeable fact that low lands of even East Moreton grew to advantage.
Toowoomba had 426 acres; Warwick and Allora, 368 ; Gatton, 313 ;
but Brisbane district had 986, and Logan, 277. Tobacco, arrowroot,
tapioca, and fruit of all kinds are also successful!}'- reared. The
hanana crop is good, South Queensland oranges flourish well, pine-
apples abound. There were lately 462 acres in bananas ; 237, oranges;
184, pineapples; 328, vines. Cocoa-nuts and bread-fruit are being
raised in the far North for the Polynesian cane-growers. The best
English apples and plums succeed to perfection about Stanthorpe and
Warwick. Vines flourish in southern Queensland; but the country,
though quite warm enough, is not so dry as the noted regions for vine-
yards in Victoria, New South Wales, and South Australia. Men
engaged in the cultivation of the sugar-cane have been most
prosperous.
The social condition of the inhabitants of Queensland is thoroughly
English. There are numerous schools and churches, and municipal
bodies regulate the law, and promote the general progress. There are
hospitals for the sick, and asylums for the unfortunate or the aged ; but
with regard to pauperism, where it is stated that in England one in
thirty are paupers, in Queensland they number but one in 330. State
assistance is afforded to Schools of Design, Free Libraries, and Me-
chanics’ Institutes, that the adult population may enjoy like advantages
granted to the young. With over forty newspapers, which at a
corresponding rate would mean eight hundred for London alone, there
is no want of enlightenment by the press. Most of the favourite
amusements of Britain are in lively exercise. The drama is popular;
but concerts, as all over Australia, the Land of So?ig, are very com-
mon. Racing finds many admirers. Cricket clubs, and boating and
yachting also exist. Freemasons, Odd Fellows, and Good Templars, are
to he found there. Prudent habits are nourished, not only by the
orthodox banks, but by savings’ banks. With 310 post-offices, and
327 electric telegraph stations, there is no want of accommodation
for the commercial public. The railway receipts during 1878 were
£237,000, and the expenditure £155,316. The cost of construction
has been £9,122 per mile on 428 miles; but the rate is cheaper now.
Fresh rails are to be laid from Bundaberg to New Moonta, Mary-
borough to Gympie and Burrum, Townsville to Charters Towers,
Gladstone to Rockhampton, Brisbane to Logan and Caboolture,
Mitchell to Charleville, Cooktown to Palmer.


The mortality returns of Queensland are an indication of its
climatic qualities; still, with regard to certain districts, explanations
must be made. The proportion of deaths to population may be the
same in two places, and yet one be much more healthy than the
other. The character of individuals, the nature of employment, and
the number of young children, exert powerful influence on the tables.
Where men are intemperate, where the labour is dangerous, or where
families abound, the death-rate will be increased, whatever the climate
may be. Still, taking figures as a basis, what do we find 1 England
averages 23 deaths to the 1,000; Queensland has been as high as 21,
but as low as 14. It is therefore healthier than England, and much
healthier than Scotland. The high numbers experienced once or
twice in the colony rose from Brisbane sickness, particularly among
very young children in excessive heat. The mortality seemed alarm-
ing, but was exceptional. Compared with England, the most favoured
of countries, the health of babies was better in the colony. The
average mortality under 5 years is about the same in both countries.
But while only 13 5 2 per cent, were under 5 in the Fatherland,
there were 16-6 6 in Queensland, so reducing the relative fatality in
the new settlement. Moreover, those over 55 in England muster
10-64 per cent., while only 3-28, or a third of the amount, in the
colony. This still further reduces the relative fatality in the latter.
Young children die there, but to a less extent than at home. Bris-
bane has been exceptionally bad, owing to defective drainage, and
too much indifference to hygienic principles. When 24-50 per cent,
fell under one year old there, the deaths were but 12 in Ipswich
town, apparently worse situated. The proportion dying under 5,
great as it appears, is but 55-7 per cent, to the living, while 55-9 in
the colony of Victoria, and 71-2 in London, But in the country,
tropics or not, the mortality is trifling among either children or adults,
although accidents, from the vicissitudes of bush life or reckless care-
lessness, furnish so large an amount. The proportion of births to
deaths in England is about 1| to 1. In the township of Ipswich the
other year it was 425 to 143; Toowoomba, 465 to 173; Gympie,
245 to 85 ; but the more populous and heated northern town of
Rockhampton had 420 to 252, which, though less favourable than in
the south, stood higher than in England.
SOUTH AFRICA.
This rapidly-improving colony presents more than ordinary attrac-
tions for the emigrant, and will probably continue to do so for the
next couple of decades by reason of the revived interest on the part
of capitalists, and the grants which have recently been made by
Government for the extension of the railway systems, &c. Hew
discoveries of diamonds have been made, and the copper mining and


ostrich farming have had new zeal given them consequent on in-
creased population, and the new openings for trade in the interior,
together with the discovery of gold in the Transvaal, and of extensive
beds of coal in more than one part of Cape Colony. As evidence of
the rapid strides which this portion of the globe has taken, it is
stated that whereas fourteen years since one steamer a month was
sufficient to meet the demands of communication with the home
country, at the present two steamers per week are scarcely adequate.
During the same period the revenue and imports of the colony have
nearly trebled in value; and if everything is taken into consider-
ation, the exports may he classed as ditto. There are four main
lines of railway at the Cape, and Natal is now constructing a fifth.
Inland telegraphs are being supplied, and many public works are
being projected and carried out, and thus skilled labour is on all
hands in great demand.
The component parts of South Africa may he classed (1) British
colonies, under the dominion of the British Crown; (2) the Orange Free
State, an independent Dutch Republic; (3) countries inhabited by,
and still in possession of, native tribes ; and (4) Portuguese territories.
The British provinces comprise—Cape Colony; Griqualand West,
with its diamond - fields; Basutoland, and the Transkeian districts;
Natal on the east coast, and the Transvaal.
The increasing trade of South Africa has had a gratifying ten-
dency to promote friendship amongst the sections named, and already
commercial and social relationships have been established. It is
stated in Mr, Silver’s Hand-hook to South Africa that little doubt
exists of still greater successes being in store for the colony in the
future. It possesses a more magnificent back country than perhaps
any other British colony. The rich lands of the Transvaal and Free
State, and the well-watered plains further north, which present so
many inducements to agriculturists, are at the present time com-
paratively unpeopled. Consequent on the increase of population
building operations are considerable, thereby offering employment to
carpenters and joiners, masons and bricklayers, smiths, plumbers, and
painters, and in each case the workmen are advised to take their tools
with them. The tools may be purchased in the colony, but of
course at a greater cost.
I will next proceed to briefly describe the named provinces in the
British possessions in South Africa, and commence with Basutoland.
The country, which is most picturesque, measures about 150 miles
long by 50 miles wide, and contains some 7,000 square miles, its
population being estimated at 75,000. Its principal productions are
wool, wheat, mealies, and Kaffir corn. A large demand for the three
last-named commodities comes from the diamond-fields, the Free State,
and the districts of Colesburg and Hope Town. The country is well
watered. Several indications of coal, iron, and copper have been
discovered. The climate is cool and temperate in summer, with an
average rainfall, and dry and bracing in the winter, snow occasionally
being seen. Commerce and agriculture are largely developing, the


number of trading stations having increased in nine years from thirty
to fifty; whilst merchandise to the value of some £150,000 has been
imported into the country during the same period. The variations in
the amounts of revenue collected will prove the growth of the place,
as from one year to another it has increased £2,953. In one year
(’79) no less than 600 ploughs were purchased by the Basutos. The
Transkeian districts, which comprise the whole of the territory ex-
tending from the great Kei and its tributary, the Indwe, to the
western boundary of hiatal, come next. The area of these districts
is about 16,000 square miles, which is almost equal to that of hiatal;
and the inland boundary to the sea varies between 100 and 110 miles.
The natural features and productive capabilities of these districts are
described as of the finest description, the grasses in some parts
growing to the extent of five or six feet in height. Copper and
coal have been found here. The population is variously estimated
at 475,000.
Fingoland is an annexation, and is about 40 miles square, having a
population of about 45,000. There are 45 trading stations, and
transactions in wool and English merchandise are numerous.
Another district, called Emigrant Tambookies, is a strip of land to
the west and north of Fingoland, and is about 80 miles long and 20
miles broad, and possesses a population of some 40,000. The land is
rich, and eminently fitted for cultivation. Wool, wheat, oats, and
corn form staple objects of trade.
Next comes the Idutevya Reserve, which has an area of about 25
miles, and a population of 18,000. This little spot also possesses
characteristics already attributed to adjoining districts.
Tambokieland proper is a fine tract of land of some 75 miles long,
and is a district of excellent natural capabilities, admirably suited for
grazing and cultivation. It is also well watered and wooded. There
is a good deal of wealth in the land, and the district is abundant in
cattle. Shops are numerous, and are well supplied with merchandise.
On one station alone the stocks are estimated at £25,000. Wool is
an important item in its products.
Nomansland is the largest of the annexed portions of Kaffirland,
its length being, from east to west, about 125 miles, and its breadth
from 40 to 75. In this place is included Griqualand, which has a
population of 32,000, and from which large quantities of wheat and
wool are obtained.
Another of the Transkeian districts is Gealekaland, which is about
50 miles long by 30 broad, and has a population of 60,000. Fair
agricultural capabilities, plenty of cattle and timber, and some tobacco,
are the descriptions of the place. It has 12 trading stations, and it
is said that agricultural implements and workers are much sought
after.
Yet another district, Bourvaniland, which measures some 30 miles
by 20, and has a population of 20,000.
Of the independent districts, Pondoland is mentioned as being noted
for sweet grass, suited to sheep and cattle, is a spot of great fertility


and beauty, bas a great quantity of cattle, and is said to be adapted
to the growing of cotton, sugar, and coffee.
Thus it will be seen by a careful reader that, from the various
extents of area and the number of populations, much scope is offered
to the agriculturist.
Then the more speculative of individuals will find attractions in
the diamond-fields of Griqualand West, which has recently been
formally annexed to Cape Colony, although at present the inhabitants
seem indisposed to recognize the validity of the act. Its dimensions
are about 150 miles from east to west, and 100 from north to south,
and its population is estimated at 45,000.
hiatal is what is termed the second place in the South African
group of settlements, as, although it is not half the extent of the
Free State or one-fourth of the Transvaal, its advantageous position
on the seaboard, and its consequent enjoyment of a large shipping
trade, together with the enterprize of its white inhabitants, and the
interest commanded by the history and condition of its large native
population, give it a comparative importance which its area would not
justify. The area of Natal is computed to be 17,000 square miles,
and its population 325,512. The climate is said to be one of the
boasts of its inhabitants. The winter is bright and comparatively
cool, and the summer heat is tempered by a clouded sky and frequent
rains; whilst the spring and autumn are most agreeable* Of the
natural productions gold, iron, and coal are found; copper, slate,
granite, and marble exist; and it is opined that the time will come
when the minerals of Natal will be of the greatest importance to the
wealth and industries of the colony. The climate and soil favours
the growth of sugar, coffee, spices, arrowroot, tobacco, silk, cotton,
flax, and tropical and semi-tropical fruits. The districts and towns
included in Natal are, Victoria, Durban, Alexandria, Alfred, Umvoli,
Pietermaritzburg, Newcastle, Klip Paver, and Weenen.
Pietermaritzburg, which is the capital of Natal, is a remarkably
fine town, is the residence of the bishops and judges, and the
head-quarters of the military, and its population numbers some
8,000.
Durban comes next in point of importance, its population being
2,000 more than that of the capital. It is the only seaport in Natal,
and its success has yet to be achieved, when the harbour works are
completed, and the railways have made transport along the coast and
to and from the interior regular and comparatively easy. It is a place
of trade, and abounds in all kinds of commercial institutions. The
principal imports to Natal are cotton, linen, woollen, and leather
manufactures, apparel, haberdashery, saddlery, cabinet and upholstery
ware, machinery, iron of all kinds, ale and beer, wines and spirits,
grain of all kinds, tea, sugar (raw and refined), oilman stores, &c.;
and the total worth of these articles imported in 1868 was .£317,000,
whilst in 1877 it was £1,167,402. Of the principal exports, which
in 1868 amounted to £271,000, and in 1877 had reached £644,165,
mention may be made of arrowroot, grain, butter, hides, skins, ivory,


ostrich feathers, salt meat, bacon and hams, coffee, rum, cotton, sugar,
and wool.
What is known as the Orange Free State, a portion of the colony
over which there has been constant bickerings between the British
Government and the natives, contains an area of about 70,000 square
miles. Its climate is remarkably healthy, and its population is
variously estimated at 45,000, more than one-half of whom are of
European descent. Wool and agricultural produce are its principal
features of trade, enormous numbers of sheep and cattle being every-
where observable, whilst fruit and grain are also abundant. Mr.
Silver’s handbook says that land throughout the State is rising in value,
and is likely to do so, as there is no longer any portion left unowned.
Prices vary, of course, according to position in relation to markets and
ports, and also according to quality. The cheapest farms are on the
north-west side. In May, 1875, 28,810 acres were sold in lots fur
£11,943; one lot of 4,400 acres was sold for 10s. per acre, and
another of 6,000 at the same price; whilst others sold at the rate of
6s. 6d. and 7s. 6d. per acre respectively. Diamonds and other
precious stones are found in the Free State, and indications of coal
have been discovered.
Although, as is known, the Transvaal w r as founded by British
subjects, it was at no time claimed or occupied as British terri-
tory, The progress of this portion of the country has been something
remarkable, almost every year adding fresh evidence of its great and
various wealth. Recently-discovered gold-fields have largely con-
tributed to this. The area of the Transvaal is estimated to be 120,000
square miles, the population being roughly stated at 50,000 whites
and 775,000 natives. Its nearest point to the sea is 100 miles, and
it is remarkable for its fruitfulness and mineral wealth. Lead, cobalt,
gold, silver, plumbago, saltpetre, and sulphur are found here, and ex-
tensive lead works have been established, whilst splendid coal-fields
also exist. The Transvaal is in parts well wooded, as a grazing
ground is considered to be unsurpassed, and is generally described as
the granary of the interior, being rich in corn land. Cotton, coffee,
sugar, and almost all fro [deal fruits can also be reared. The districts
of the Transvaal are Botscherfstroom, Pretoria, Rustenburg, Leyden-
burg, Marico, Christiana, Waterbergen, and Zout-spanbergia, each
being described as suited to agriculture. The land prices here also
vary with the districts, in some parts being obtainable at as low figures
as 6d., 9d., or even less. The prices of food-stuffs are said to be
ridiculously high, this being attributed to the difficulties of the
labour market and the habits of the emigrant Boers. Gold is also
abundant here, and recent reports of this industry speak most
favourably.
The amounts of the wages paid to the various classes of labour,
together with house rent and the cost of food and clothing, will be
gathered from the annexed lists, as given in Mr. Silver’s handbook :

In a work having special reference to the climate and health of
South Africa, written by James Bonwick, Esq., f.r.g.s., the following
comparisons between England and South Africa appear:
“ The English health question cannot fail to strike the returned
colonist from the southern hemisphere. While the annual mortality
at home is about twenty-three in the thousand, it is but two-thirds of
that in Australia, New Zealand, and the Cape Colony; and yet the
hardships and perils of bush life, with the distance from medical aid,
must tell seriously against the settlers. What then makes the differ-
ence 1 Mainly climate. There can be no doubt about the rigour of
the British climate. The strong may be braced by it; but the weak
are enfeebled. Every year the consumptive circle widens in Great
Britain and Ireland. Even where no disease actually exists, the
seeds are simply awaiting some climatic agency to give them deadly
force. In the course of nearly forty years’ experience of the southern
colonies the writer has met many persons who had by emigration lost
their old susceptibility to chest affections, and whose children enjoyed
a precious freedom from the fear of those terrible maladies.”
AUSTRALIA.
To first speak in general terms of this country, I may say that the
Australian Colonies are —New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia,
Queensland, Western Australia, Tasmania. The first five are situated
on the Australian continent. Tasmania, formerly Van Diemen’s Land,
is separated from it by Bass’s Straits. The climate of the Australian
Colonies generally is healthy, and well suited to Europeans. It is
dry, free from malaria, and from the inconveniences of both hot and
cold countries. It is, however, subject during a portion of the summer
months to the drawback of the winds, dust, and drought. The


droughts occur, it is supposed, periodically; hut in ordinary years
there is hut little scarcity of rain. The seasons are the reverse of
those in Europe, December being Midsummer, and June mid-winter.
During a large portion of the year the weather is fine, the sky cloud-
less, and the atmosphere elastic and exhilarating. In the southern
colonies (Tasmania and Victoria) the temperature is cooler than in
New South Wales and Queensland, which are further north, and it is
believed that the rainfall is greater on the eastern than on the western
side of the continent. The total population of Australia, exclusive
of New Zealand, is estimated at a little over 2,000,000.
NEW SOUTH WALES
Was the first colony established in Australia. At the beginning of
1877 the population was estimated at 629,776, of whom 347,869
were males, and 281,907 were females. The estimated area of the
colony is about 207,000,000 acres, or about three times the size of
Great Britain and Ireland. It is only partially surveyed; but
numerous portions of surveyed land are available for immediate
purchase. Grazing leases, conferring rights of pasturage on the
holders, have been issued for about two-thirds of the whole colony.
The leases, however, do not confer any title to the soil. The climate
is considered to he very salubrious; hut from the great extent of the
colony, and other causes, it varies very much. Although tropical
plants grow in Sydney gardens, a five hours’ journey from Sydney by
rail is sufficient to reach a climate where British fruits, flowers, and
grapes are cultivated with success. January and February are the
hottest months; March and December, May and September, June
and August, are of nearly equal temperature; and April is the same
as the mean of October and November.
The chief productions for exportation are wool, tallow, and minerals.
The public lands are, as a rule, disposed of by sale at auction. The
upset price of country land is twenty shillings per acre, and land of
that description, which has been put up to auction and not sold, may
afterwards be bought at the upset price. Certain lands may also be
purchased on “conditional sale.” By this plan any one may, on
certain notified days, make to the land agent of the district a written
application for the conditional purchase of not less than 40 nor more
than 320 acres, accompanied by a deposit of one-fourth of the pur-
chase money, at the rate of £1 an acre. The lands to he selected
must, however, not he town or suburban lands, nor within a pro-
claimed gold-field, unless unoccupied for gold mining purposes, and
must not he within certain distances of towns or villages, varying
from ten to two miles, according to the population of the place, nor
reserved for town site, or other public purposes. At the expiration of
three years and three months the purchaser has the option of paying
the balance of the purchase money, and receiving a conveyance in


fee, or of deferring the payment indefinitely, by paying interest at the
rate of five per cent, per annum on the amount within three months
after the Ist of January in each year. The purchaser, however, must
in either case prove to the satisfaction of the Minister of Public Lands
that he has made improvements to the extent and value required by
the Act; that he has bond fide resided continuously, either by himself
or his alienees, on the land; and that he has not alienated it until
after at least one year’s bond fide residence thereon. “ Rights of
commonage,” and leases of pasture lands for the grazing of stock and
sheep, are procurable in the colony at a rent of £2 per square mile
in the first-class settled districts, and in the unsettled districts at such
rent as may be determined by appraisement of the fair value.*'
As regards gold mining, the Government is empowered to proclaim
Crown lands to be gold-fields, and to grant what are called “ miners’
rights ” on the payment of a small fee. And leases of auriferous
tracts of alluvial ground and quartz reefs, and portions of river beds,
for limited periods may be granted at annual rents, under special con-
ditions as regards labour or machinery. On 31st March, 1877, the
number of holders of lands, exclusive of those for pastoral purposes,
exceeding one acre was 39,639. The land under cultivation was
513,840 acres, and was applied to the raising of wheat, maize, barley,
oats, rye, millet, potatoes, tobacco, arrowroot, sugar-cane, grasses for
hay and fodder, and vines. 20,453 acres were devoted to gardens and
orchards.
The number of manufactories established in the colony in 1876 was
10,623. Of these 8,065 were connected with, or dependent upon,
agriculture, 382 working on raw materials connected with sheep and
stock raised in the colony, 274 connected with the manufacture of
food and artificial drinks, 684 with building materials, &c., 150 with
works and foundries for metals, and 1,068 with other miscellaneous
works and manufactories.
The average rate of wages for carpenters, smiths, wheelwrights,
bricklayers, and masons was from 9s. to 11s. per diem without board
and lodging, and from £BO to £126 per annum with board and
lodging. Farm labourers and shepherds received from £3O to £4O
per annum. Female domestic servants from £2O to £3O, and good
cooks from £35 to £52, with board and lodging.
At present assistance from colonial funds towards passages to this
colony is limited to persons between the ages of 12 years and 50
years, and to children coming with their parents. The emigrants
must be of sound mental and bodily health, and of good moral
character, and must consist of mechanics, domestic servants, farmers,
and any description of labourers suitable for country pursuits, to be
chosen by the Agent-General for the colony with a special view to the
promotion of the industrial pursuits of the colony. Miners are not in
much demand.
* The regulations for the disposal of Crown lands are, it is understood, under
the consideration of the Colonial Government.


The following payments are required to be made by persons selected
for passages; Children under 3 years of age, free; children 3 and
under 12, £1; 12, and not exceeding 50 years of age, £2. These
payments include bedding and mess utensils for the voyage. Female
domestic servants thoroughly acquainted with their duties, as well as
farm labourers and shepherds, readily obtain situations on remunera-
tive terms; hut for educated persons, such as governesses, tutors,
clerks, &c., there is no demand, and the emigration to the colony of
such persons (unless for the purpose of joining friends or relatives
able to maintain them for some time after arrival) is not encouraged.
The cost of a steerage passage to blew South Wales is about £l5 per
adult, and half that price for children under 12. These passages
may he obtained through shipping firms.
VICTORIA.
The colony of Victoria, originally part of New South Wales, forms
the south-eastern portion of Australia. Its greatest length from east
to west is about 420 miles, and its breadth about 250 miles. It con-
tains an area of about 56,446,720 acres, or 88,198 square miles. This
is somewhat less than the area of England, Scotland, and Wales,
which contains 89,644 square miles. In January, 1878, 18,206,165
acres had been granted, sold, or selected, and 12,002,587 were avail-
able for future selection. The reserves in connection with pastoral
occupation numbered about 350,000 acres. The number of squatting
runs in 1877 was 801, and the area of Crown lands embraced in runs
was 20,854,615 acres, the average size of a run being 26,650 acres.
Victoria contains, in addition to its mineral wealth, fine soils suitable
for the growth of wheat, barley, oats, potatoes, the grape, olive, fig,
date, coral tree, sugar, millet, and tobacco, and, in certain favoured
situations, for the growth of the tea plant. There are also some parts
suitable for cotton and rice.
The mean annual temperature, as deduced from a long series of
meteorological observations, is 58°.
In autumn and winter the northerly winds exceed the southerly,
and in spring and summer the southerly winds exceed the northerly.
In summer the north winds are dry and often hot, but at night the
wind frequently changes to the south-west or south; and from either
of these points it is always cool and refreshing. The mean rainfall in
the year is nearly 30 inches.
The disposal of Crown lands in Victoria is regulated by the “ Land
Act, 1869,” which is intended to facilitate the acquisition of land by
bond fide settlers. The lands are obtainable either (I) by selection at
£1 per acre, payable by instalments, or (2) by auction at an upset
price of £1 per acre, prompt payment.
1. Persons desirous of purchasing land in any district not specially
exempted may, subject to certain regulations as to boundaries, select


any quantity of unoccupied land not exceeding 320 acres before it has
been surveyed, and obtain an occupation license for three years at a
yearly rental of 2s. per acre. The license is not transferable. The
licensee is required to fence the land within two years; to reside upon
it for two years and a half; and during the currency of his license to
cultivate at least one acre out of every 10 included in it. If these
conditions have been fulfilled, he is entitled, at the end of three years,
at his option, either to pay 14s. an acre for the land, which then
becomes his own, or to obtain a lease of it for seven years at a yearly
rental of 2s. per acre. When the payments (which may be made in
anticipation) have amounted to 20s. an acre, a grant in fee is issued
by the Governor.
2. Crown lands, to an extent not exceeding 200,000 acres a year,
are also disposed of at auction at an upset price of not less than 20s.
an acre. Lands exposed to auction, and not sold, may afterwards he
purchased at the upset price, or at the highest price bid at the sale.
All town and village lands must be sold at auction. Leases of Crown
lands for 21 years, at a rent of not less than £5 a year, and for
quantities not exceeding three acres, may be obtained for the sites of
inns, stores, smithies, and other similar buildings, in thinly-peopled
districts ; also for hathing-places, bridges, ferries, and other purposes
of public utility. Pastoral licenses for new runs deemed sufficient to
carry 4,000 sheep or 1,000 cattle are put up to auction at a rent fixed
by the Board of Land and Works, and sold to the person bidding the
highest premium. The licenses are granted for any period not exceed-
ing 14 years. Miners’ rights are issued for any number of years not
exceeding 15, at the rate of ss. for every year. “Miners’ rights”
entitle the holders to take possession for gold-mining purposes, and
for residence, of so much of the Crown lands as may be prescribed by
the bye-laws of the Local Mining Board of the district within which
the land is situated. Leases of auriferous lands, in quantities not less
than one nor more than 30 acres, are granted for any term not exceed-
ing 15 years, at an annual rental of £1 per acre. The number of
holdings in Victoria on 31st March, 1878, exceeding one acre was
45,448, and the quantity of land in occupation during the year ended
31st March, 1878, was 14,806,926 acres. The number of manu-
factories and works, &c., in operation in 1877-78 was 2,370, employ-
ing 32,688 hands, the approximate value of lands, buildings, machinery,
and plant being £6,665,540. On Ist January, 1878, there were 19
lines of railway open, of the aggregate length of 950 miles. The
population of the colony on 30th June, 1878, was estimated at
867,634 persons, of whom 471,346 were males, and 396,288 females.
The current rate of wages at the end of August, 1879, was: —For
farm labourers, married, without rations for family, £7O to £9O per
annum—with rations for family, £45 to £SO per annum; farm
labourers, single men, with rations, 20s. to 255. per week ; ploughmen,
with rations, 255. to 30s. The wages for artisan labour were:—
General labourers and navvies, 6s. to Bs. per day; skilled labourers,
12s. to 14s. per day. Servants’ wages were as follows : —Cooks, £35


to £6O per annum ; housemaids, £3O to £36 ; general servants, £3O
to £4O ; farm servants, £25 to £3O. The Government of Victoria
does not now grant assistance to persons desirous of emigrating. The
cost of steerage passages from London or Liverpool is about £ls for
an adult, and half-price for children between 1 and 12 years of age.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
The three great sources of wealth in this now thriving colony are
mineral, pastoral, and agricultural, and these have of late years
developed trade and commerce to an extent that appears surprising
when the statistics of population are taken into account. Although
no such rich and permanent gold-fields have been proved to exist in
this colony as those which have made the colony of Victoria famous,
its copper mines have given employment to tens of thousands. This
industry has of late been somewhat depressed all over the world ; hut
those who are well acquainted with the localities where cupriferous
deposits abound, do not hesitate to predict a prosperous future for the
mining interest of South Australia. The population is a little over
260,000, and the fact that the import and export trade in 1879
amounted to between £10,000,000 and £11,000,000 speaks well for
the general prosperity. Wool, copper, and wheat hold first positions in
the list of exports, the combined value of these in the past year being
over £4,000,000. Year by year the figures have steadily increased,
and there is at present no ground for thinking that the limit has been
reached. The construction of railways has had the tendency of
increasing the agricultural boundary, because thereby produce may he
more quickly and economically shipped. The colony has an extensive
coast-line, and the land which will ultimately prove available for
cultivation is almost unlimited.
With regard to pastoral pursuits, the opening of the vast interior by
the construction of the telegraph line to Port Darwin, the results of
the researches of various exploring parties, and the construction of a
transcontinental railway—the first link of which is in progress—are
destined to facilitate their expansion to an extent which it is at present
impossible to estimate. When it is borne in mind that the area of the
colony (including the northern territory) is upwards of 900,000
square miles, of which little more than one per cent, is alienated from
the Crown, and less than one-third is in occupation, the undeveloped
resources of the colony will be seen to justify very sanguine anticipa-
tions.
The area of the colony, exclusive of the recently added northern
territory, is estimated at 243,244,800 acres, of which 8,279,028 acres
had been alienated at the date of the last returns. The area of the
northern territory has not been ascertained, hut is estimated at
335,116,800 acres. The climate of the southern portion of the colony
is said greatly to resemble that of Sicily and Naples. During nine or


ten months in the year it is agreeable. What are called winter months
(i.e. June, July, and August) are, in truth, a rainy season, and would
be considered in England merely a wet summer. The only disagreeable
portion of the year is the three summer months ; viz., December,
January, and February, when the sun attains great power, and when
winds from the distant interior greatly increase the natural heat of
the season.
The principal productions of the colony for exportation are wool,
copper, lead, and breadstuffs.
The waste lands of the Crown are, for the purposes of sale, classified
as town, suburban, and country land. All Crown lands, except
pastoral, are sold by auction after due public notice ; but country lands,
which have been put up to auction and not sold, may, in certain cases,
be sold by private contract at the upset price, or such higher price as
may have been bid at any auction. The lowest upset price is £1 per acre ;
but the Government fix a higher price for town lots, and for country
lots, on which lawful improvements have been made. But country
lands up fro 1,000 acres may be purchased in some districts on credit.
In that case the purchaser has to pay ten per cent, of the amount he
has agreed to give, which is reckoned as interest or rent for the first
three years. He has also to enter into an agreement to make im-
provements and cultivate the land. At the end of the third year ho
has to pay a second instalment of ten per cent, for another three
years. At the end of the sixth year he must pay a fourth of the
purchase money, and ten per cent, interest on the balance, which will
carry him on to the end of the ninth year, when he is expected to
complete his purchase, and receive his deeds. It is also provided that
the selector may, if in a position to do so, after five years from the
date of selection, pay the purchase money. On the 30th June, 1879,
the area held on credit amounted to 3,065,329 acres, representing
£4,345,899, which sum falls due at various times, extending to the
year 1887,
Pasture leases are granted, at the rate of 10s. per square mile, to the
first discoverer, for terms of 14 years. Other waste lands, leased for
pastoral purposes, are assessed in three classes; the minimum rent in
the first class being fixed at the rate of £1 per square mile, in the
second at Bs. 6d. per square mile, and in the third at 2s. 6d. per
square mile.
Speaking of the progress of the colony, the South Australian
Register says : “Considering the limited population of South Australia,
only amounting to 260,000 persons, about a third of whom reside in
the city and suburbs, the extent of country that is profitably occupied
in farming, pastoral pursuits, wine and fruit growing, and manufactures,
is creditable to the enterprise of the people. The area of land sold to
the end of December last was an average of over 35 acres for every
soul in the community. The returns of cultivation for 1879 are not
yet issued, but taking the figures for 1878 we find that about one-
fourth of the land alienated was under cultivation. In 1869-70,
with a population of 178,722, we cultivated 850,576 acres, or 4f acres


per head. In 1878-9 the rate of cultivation had advanced to 8£ acres
per head of the population. In addition, however, to 9,000,000
acres which have been alienated from the Crown, principally for
agricultural and horticultural settlement, immense tracts of country
are leased or otherwise held from the Government for pastoral purposes.
A quarter of a century ago these tracts did not exceed 5,000 or 6,000
square miles; in 1875 they had increased to 80,000 square miles; on
June 30th, 1879, the area reached the enormous quantity of 213,700
square miles, or 136,768,000 acres of land. These figures will serve
to show what marvellous progress is being made in the direction of
pastoral and agricultural settlement in the province. But, after all,
if we exclude the runs in the interior taken up by some of the more
adventurous of our squatters, the settlements are a mere fringe along
the coast, and there is yet room for indefinite expansion and progress.
The work of exploration—to which South Australia owes the practical
possession of such a large territory—is still going on, and year by year
fresh discoveries are being made which add largely to the capabilities
of the colony. South Australia, indeed, owes a great debt of
gratitude to those men who, regardless of personal peril, have
penetrated into the unknown parts of the continent, and proved that
vast tracts of country which were thought to be worthless can be
turned to profitable account. Olive, hop, and tobacco culture have
been found to be lucrative occupations, as also has wine-growing;
whilst fruits are very prolific. One of the fundamental principles of
the establishment of the colony was that the money derived from the
sale of land should be devoted to the introduction of labour. This
system was carried into effect to a limited extent; but in the course of
years, when the proceeds of land became large, and the requirements
of the settlers, in the way of roads, bridges, public buildings, and so
forth, correspondingly great, it was thought well to divert a portion of
the Land Fund to the execution of public works. By-and-by, as the
labouring population increased, the prejudice against spending public
money in bringing out immigrants grew apace, and for many years
there was an entire cessation of immigration. Money set apart year
by year for this service accumulated to such an extent that at length
eager eyes were directed to it by needy Treasurers, and although at
■first the form of borrowing the money was gone through, in the end
the bonds were destroyed, and the process of absorption was made
complete. Five or six years ago the demand for labour so vastly
exceeded the supply that the advocates for bringing out population at
the public cost bore down all opposition, and a considerable amount,
on one occasion £IOO,OOO, has since been annually appropriated for
and spent upon immigration. By this means thousands of persons
have been introduced from Great Britain and Germany, to the great
mutual advantage of the community and of the immigrants themselves.
Latterly, owing to the depression in copper and to a succession of in-
different wheat harvests, the supply of labour has become rather
larger than could be conveniently absorbed, and the old demand for
the discontinuance of immigration has made itself felt, A sum of


£25,000 only was voted last year, and free immigration is now
temporarily stopped. It is more than probable, however, that it will
become necessary to renew it before very long, as the prosperity of a
young colony like this is greatly enhanced by a well-regulated system
of immigration.
“ Although manufacturing industries have not developed to so great
an extent as in some of the other colonies, the progress that is being
made in this department is steady and encouraging. A few years ago
several of the leading manufacturers in Adelaide formed themselves
into an Association, having for its object the development of industries
adapted to the climate and condition of the colony, and so far their
efforts have had very beneficial results. They have now a Chamber of
their own, where novel or interesting mechanical contrivances, inven-
tions, or manufactured goods of unusual merit, are exhibited to the
public free of charge. Some time ago the Chamber published an
approximate return of manufactures in South Australia. Though this
statement is by no means complete, only 300 persons out of 500
having returned the circulars sent out, the figures given are interesting
as showing the relative importance of several of our leading industries.
They deal with the year 1876, and they show that the aggregate wages
paid to the 6,127 persons employed in the various factories during the
twelve months amounted to £586,000. Miners and smelters got by
far the largest proportion of this amount, though the mining industry
was even then in a very depressed condition. The aggregate wages
paid to the 1,045 men were £139,248. The amount received by
engineers, machinists, &c., was the next highest, and exceeded
£BB,OOO. Then come the timber merchants, builders, &c., with a
wages fund for the year of £54,000; brewers, distillers, wine-makers,
and cordial-makers with £42,660; clothing manufacturers, with
£35,856, divided among the women and men employed by them;
boot and shoe makers, with £35,500; tanners and fellmongers, with
£22,730; brickmakers and potters, £22,000; cabinetmakers,
£16,300; printers, £16,200; iron and tin workers, £14,000 ;
shipbuilders, &c., £13,000; and coachbuilders, £11,700. The return
from which these figures are taken shows that of the 6,127 persons
employed 853 were females, 600 of whom are engaged in the clothing
factories, which have now to a great extent reduced the importation of
ready-made goods. The boot factories in the city have also been
developed considerably of late years, and the importation of many
kinds of boots has now almost ceased. At one or two of the boot
factories over 100 hands are employed, and the proprietors have gone
to considerable expense in introducing steam-riveters and other labour-
saving machinery. In the boot and clothing factories together over
1,200 men and girls are employed. The Government returns, based
on the census of 1876, show that there are twenty-four boot factories
in the colony, employing 520 men and 155 women; and thirteen
establishments, where clothing is made up, and where seventy-five men
and 458 girls are engaged. These numbers, although they do not
represent the exact totals at the present time, are still approximately


correct. Over 1,100 persons are employed in the production of agri-
cultural implements, engines, and machinery.
“ Most of the agricultural implements used in the colony are made
here—all the reapers or ‘strippers’—there being no less than forty-
three implement yards, many of which are in the country towns,
particularly to the north of Adelaide, in which direction settlement
has lately been rapidly extending. No locomotive engines have yet
been made in the colony, and most of the stationary engines are also
imported; but the erection of these and the necessary repairs give
employment to a large number of hands. There were at the last
census 814 workers in metals, including 291 iron, brass, and copper
founders; 276 engaged in smelting copper, 154 iron and tin smiths,
and 85 manufacturing goldsmiths and jewellers. This latter branch of
industry has lately been extended, and Adelaide-made jewellery has
received very high commendation. Carriage building is extensively
carried on in Adelaide, and all kinds of vehicles—from the railway
carriage to the tramcar, and the humblest trap that runs on wheels—
are turned out of the works. The colony is well supplied in respect
of facilities for instruction—post offices, banks, telegraphs, and other
means of communication, as well as ample means of conveyance. It
has also numerous charitable institutions, friendly societies, &c.”

The rent of a dwelling suitable for an artisan and his family in
Adelaide or the immediate suburbs varies from six to fifteen shillings
per week, but in the country towns the rate is less. Large numbers
of artisans, however, reside in their own freehold cottages. The
savings of a few years have in many instances sufficed to enable them
to accomplish this. Land is cheap, and the necessary advances for the
erection of dwellings are readily obtainable from the several Building
Societies. Cottages, with fuel and water, are provided for ploughmen,
shepherds, and other labourers employed on farms or sheep-runs. The
following are quoted rates for house-rent and for board and lodging :
House-Rent. —Two rooms, 4s. to 65.; three rooms, 6s. to 10s.; four
rooms, Bs. to 15s. ; six rooms, 12s. to 255., free from taxes; single
room, 2s. 6d.; ditto (furnished), 6s. to 9s. per week. Gas is Bs. to 12s.
per 1,000 cubic feet, and water laid on at Is. 6d. per 1,000 gallons.
Board and Bodying. Per week at Bushmen’s Club, 18s.; at
private houses, for single young men, shopmen, &c., 15s. to 18s. ;
clerks, &c., 20s. to 305.; single females, 10s. to 155.; private lodgers
at hotels, 20s. to £4 4s.
Wearing Apparel is procurable at the undermentioned prices :
Working men’s black cloth suits, 395. to 905.; every-day wear, 295.
to 655.; moleskin trousers, 6s. 6d. to 10s. 6d.; tweed suits, 295. to
80s.; jackets, 13s. to 405.; waistcoats, ss. to 11s.; trousers, Bs. to
255.; boys’ clothes, 15s. to 40s. per suit.
Free passages are granted to the nominees of residents in the colony
of the following classes :
Agricultural labourers, female servants, shepherds, millers, wood-


cutters, gardeners, farriers, teamsters, and ploughmen, of ages ranging
from 18 to 40, able-bodied and healthy. The emigrants pay 15s.
each for bedding and mess-kit. After two years’ residence in the
colony each adult emigrant is entitled to select, from any unimproved
rural Crown lands open to selection, 50 acres of land, and each
emigrant between the ages of 16 and 21, 25 acres of land, not to
exceed 150 acres in all for any one family. After three years’ occupa-
tion the land becomes the property of the selector, provided certain
improvements have been made on it. Emigrants have to sign an
undertaking to remain in the colony for the space of three years from
the date of arrival, or in the event of leaving the colony within that
period, to pay to the Colonial Treasury the sum of £lB per adult.
Passages are granted to families which do not comprise more than
three children under 12 years old.
WESTERN AUSTRALIA.
Western Australia was first settled in 1829. The colony includes all
that portion of Australia situated to the westward of the 129° of east
longitude. The population on the 31st December, 1878, amounted
to 28,166, of whom 16,409 were males, and 11,757 females. The
number of convicts on 31st December, 1878, in the colony was 608.
No more convicts have been sent out since 1867. The climate is
delightful and healthy. From the northern to the southern extremity
it varies considerably ; the southern temperature is somewhat similar
to that of England; the northern is hot, but not unpleasant, being
tempered with cool breezes, and the climate of the central portion of
the colony is like that of Southern Italy and parts of Spain. The
regularity of the sea breezes in the summer, which are rarely inter-
mitted, enables one to bear without discomfort the power of the sun.
Wages average the same as in the south.
The mean average prices of various articles of use or consumption are
—wheaten flour, per bag of 200 lbs., £1 155.; wheat, per imperial
bushel, 6s. 6d.; wheaten bread, per lb., 2d.; horned cattle, per lb.,
3d.; horses, each, £5 to £25; sheep, each, 135.; goats, each, £1 ;
swine, per lb., 6d. ; milk, per gallon, 25.; butter, fresh, per lb., 2s. ;
butter, salt, Is. Bd.; cheese, Is. 6d.; beef, 6d.; mutton, 5d.; pork,
lOd. ; rice, 3d.; coffee, Is. 6d.; tea, 25.; sugar, 5d.; salt, Id.; wine,
imported, per gallon, £1 and upwards; wine, colonial, per gallon, 45.,
and upwards; brandy, per gallon, £1 10s.; beer, imported, per gallon,
draught, 45., bottled, 75.; beer, colonial, per gallon, 35.; tobacco,
per lb., 4s.
The quantity of land alienated is 1,469,691 acres. The quantity in
cultivation is estimated at 51,674 acres. Country land in lots of not
less than 40 acres are sold at a fixed price of 10s. per acre. Town
and suburban lots are sold by auction, the size and upset price being
fixed by the Governor.


TASMANIA,
Which, by its favourable temperature and richness of soil, has been
called “ The Granary of the Australias,” “ The Garden of the South,”
and the “ Sanitarium of India and Tropical Countries,” is, though
imperfectly known as an emigrant station, a most desirable spot for the
labourer and the capitalist. It is an island at the southern extremity
of the Continent of New Holland, from which it is divided by Bass’s
Straits. The surface is diversified by ranges of hills and valleys, with
here and there large plains ; and it is thought by many to be the most
healthy of all the British colonies, being never too hot in summer, or
too cold in winter, for out-door occupations to be carried on. The
seasons commence in September, the winter being necessarily in June,
July, and August; and, taking a twenty-five years’ average, the mean
heat of the spring is 54; summer, 62; autumn, 55; and winter, 47
degrees. The rainfall of the year averages 145 days, the quantity
varying at *22 inches, and there are never more than 40 days on which
out-door work cannot be done. An electric cable connects Tasmania
and Victoria, and land-lines extend from the latter place to New South
Wales, Queensland, and South Australia; another line from Adelaide
(South Australia), connecting Port Darwin, is near completion, which
will connect the line by way of Java to England. Steam communica-
tion with England via Galle is to be obtained every three or four
weeks, and the postal arrangements are also very good. There is
also ample steam communication between Tasmania and the other
Australian ports, as well as mercantile marine representatives. The
island contains 15£ million acres of land, and the islands connected
with it contain million acres; 3,782,542 acres have been sold or
granted to settlers by the Crown, leaving the Crown land property at
about 13,000,000 acres, of which one-and-a-half million acres are
leased by settlers for sheep-runs or other purposes. The colony is
divided into 18 counties; viz. : Northern —Cornwall, Dorset, Devon,
Wellington; Southern —Buckingham, Monmouth, Pembroke, Kent;
Eastern —Glamorgan ; Western —Arthur, Montgomery, Franklin,
Montagu, Eussell; Central —Cumberland, Lincoln, Somerset, West-
moreland. The islands are 55 in number, most of them being in
Bass’s Straits. Besides the corporations of the city of Hobart Town
and town of Launceston, there are nineteen rural municipal councils in
the colony, each with its warden and a sufficient police; so that the
island may be said to be in a thoroughly civilized condition. Further
evidence of this is not wanting by the fact that Benevolent Societies,
Working Men’s Clubs, Homes for the Poor, an Asylum for the Insane,
Hospitals for the Sick, an Asylum for Orphans, three Asylums for
Paupers, Reformatories, Boys’ Home, City Mission, Town Mission,
Bible Societies, Temperance Societies, Odd Fellows’ Societies, Free-
masons’ Lodges, Gardeners’ Societies, Agricultural Associations, &c.,
have been established, and are in active operation. The main road
across the country, from the port of Hobart Town to that of Launces-
ton, is 120 miles long, and is maintained in excellent order by the


Government; all the other roads are under the care of trustees, who
raised in 1869 rates to the amount of £21,858 for the maintenance
and repair of 2,739 miles of roads, whilst £2,772 were expended on
bridges. A line of railway, to connect the two ports of Hobart Town
and Launceston, is in contemplation, at a cost of £650,000. The
railway from the port of Launceston to Deloraine, which passes for 45
miles through some of the best agricultural lands of the colony, is
completed, and its traffic returns are very satisfactory. It cost
£450,000. The lowest upset price of Crown land fit for agriculture
is fixed by Act of Parliament at an acre, and the lowest upset
price of pastoral lands at a sum equal to 12 years’ rental, but not less
than ss. an acre. Emigrants who have been selected as eligible
persons by the appointed agents in England, are allowed plots of land
on very advantageous terms, inasmuch as if he pays the full cost of his
family’s passage out, a warrant, which will entitle the holder to receive
from the Immigration Agent in Tasmania an order for Crown land, to
the value of £lB for each member of the family above 15 years of age,
and £9 for each member above 12 months and under 15 years old;
and these land-orders will be received by the Government as payment
for any Crown lands that the emigrant may buy after his arrival. The
Act also empowers the Immigration Board to permit any person from
Europe or India, who has paid his own and family’s passage money, to
demand, within a year after his arrival in the colony, a certificate to
select 30 acres of land for himself, 20 for his wife (providing he has
one), and 10 for each child.
The exports of the island are principally wool, flour, grain, fruit,
preserves, hops, horses, sperm oil, timber, vegetables, and tanning
bark, the total value being £826,932 in the year 1869. The land in
cultivation on 31st March, 1870, was 318,484 acres. There were then
22,583 horses, 95,097 horned cattle, 1,531,187 sheep, and 49,524 pigs.
The average rate of wages throughout the colony, including town
and country, are: Ploughmen, 7s. 6d. to 15s, a week; farm labourers,
7s. to 155.; shepherds, £2O to £5O; gardeners, £2O to ,£40 —all
with rations, the ration being about 121 b. or more of meat, and 141 b.
of flour, 21b. sugar, -£lb. tea, per week; —day labourers, 4s. to ss. a
day; bricklayers, ss. to 8s ; masons, 6s. to 10s.; carpenters, ss. to
10s.—without rations; —female cooks, £l5 to ,£3O, with board;
laundresses, ,£l7 to ,£3O, ditto; general servants, £l3 to £3O,
ditto; housemaids, £l3 to £25, ditto; nursemaids, £l2 to £2O,
ditto.
The average price of provisions in the various towns: Bacon, 6d.
to 9d. per lb.; bread, to 2d. per lb.; butter (fresh), lOd. to 16d.
ditto; candles, s£d. ditto; cheese, 6d. to Is. ditto; coffee, Is. to
Is. 3d. ditto; meat, 2£d. to 6d, ditto; milk, 4d. to 6d. per quart;
sugar, 4d. to 6d. per lb.; tea, Is. 4d. to 3s. 6d. ditto; potatoes, 3s. to
4s. per cwt,; flour, 12s. per cwt.; beer, 6d. per quart; rum, 3s. 6d. a
bottle; brandy, ss. ditto; coals, 17s. to 275. per ton.
In a brief description of the separate townships it may he stated
that Hobart Town, which stands on the southern boundary, contains


a population of 19,092 inhabitants. It has an abundant supply of
excellent water, and its port is capable of receiving vessels of any
tonnage. Its municipal affairs are governed by a corporation. There
are markets for all necessaries, also under the control of the civic body;
whilst cab, ’bus, and steamboat accommodation whereby to reach
adjoining towns are excellent. It contains two cathedrals, thirty-one
churches and chapels, Royal Society Gardens, handsome Government
offices, Savings Banks, besides several benevolent societies.
Launceston is the second town of importance, containing 10,668
inhabitants. Its affairs also are administered to by local governing
bodies, and similar accommodation for travelling as that enjoyed by
Hobart Town exists. Twenty churches and chapels, a grammar
school, thirty-three private and three public schools, public gardens,
town hall, free library, &c., go to make up its list of social institu-
tions. It is the principal terminus of the Launceston and Deloraine
Railway, and is connected by the electric telegraph with several other
towns.
The county towns, some of which bear names familiar to us in the
mother country, are described as follows : Cornwall contains 20 towns
and villages, of which 10 are post-office stations, and in the county are
the rural municipalities of Evandale and Fingal. The principal towns
are Launceston, Evandale, Fingal, Avoca, Falmouth, the four first
being money-order stations, with a daily mail, and one to Falmouth
twice a week. The annual value of property outside the boundaries
of the municipality of Launceston is £80,491 ; acres in cultivation,
45,840; horses, 4,046; cattle, 17,567; sheep, 251,782; pigs, 6,496,
Fifteen public and six private schools, and 21 churches and chapels.
The pastoral lands of the Crown in this county, which have been
reported upon by Mr. Crawford, are—about 5,000 acres first-class,
55,000 acres second-class, 220,000 acres third-class lands. In the
Tamar and North and South Esk rivers mullet and several other fish
are taken in quantities for market, and the English brown trout has
been acclimatized. Kangaroos are plentiful, and also several kinds of
game-birds. From the dairy farms of Fingal there were produced, in
1870 —169 tons of cheese, 49 tons of butter, and 9 tons of bacon,
valued at £12,800. From the orchards of Cornwall 21,938 bushels
of apples and 6,673 bushels of pears were produced last season for
market, at 3s. to Bs. a bushel. Coal is largely found in extensive beds
near Fingal. Gold, both alluvial and in quartz, has been worked in
several places for many years in the same district, where £15,000 is
the value of the machinery used, and £7OO ss. were received in 1869
for miners’ rights. These are two ports, Falmouth and George’s
Bay. A public library of 3,000 vols. at Evandale, agricultural
associations, benefit societies, Odd Fellows’ lodges, &c. The Launceston
and Western Railway has a station near Evandale.
Dorset contains 21 townships and villages, at nine of which are
post-offices. The principal town is George Town, which is a seaport.
There is a twice-a-week mail to George Town and to Lyndhurst. The
Melbourne steamers pass the George Town wharf twice a week.


Vessels trade between Hobart Town and Launceston and the gold-
diggings at Waterhouse. The annual value of property is £6,100;
population, 1,371, inhabiting 317 houses; acres in cultivation, 3,168;
horses, 456; cattle, 2,123; sheep, 37,219; pigs, 655. There is at
George Town a public library of 1,000 vols., there being also three
schools and two churches. Of the Government land 30,000 acres are
of the best quality, and 38,000 second rate, much of it being capable
of grazing large flocks and herds.
Devon is an agricultural county, and contains 23 towns and villages,
of which 17 are post-stations. The principal towns are Deloraine,
Westbury, Latrobe, Torquay, and Garrick. The first four are stations
where post-office money-orders can be obtained. The mail communica-
tion is daily to five towns, three times a week to eight, and twice
a week to four; and a line of railway and electric telegraph connects
Deloraine and Westbury with the port of Launceston. The annual
value of property is £90,270 ; population, 18,335, inhabiting 3,000
houses; acres in cultivation, 94,997 ; horses, 5,731; cattle, 21,232;
sheep, 82,730 ; pigs, 16,667. There are public libraries at Deloraine,
Westbury, and Torquay, 22 public schools, 23 private schools, and
69 churches and chapels. In this county, near Ilfracombe, on the
river Tamar, iron ore of rich quality is found in large quantities, in
what are called the Ironstone Hills. The deposit at one spot is
estimated by Mr. Gould, f.g.s., to contain 705,800 tons of ore, above
the water level, the assay of which produced 72 per cent, of iron.
On some of the heaviest timber land, Mr. Thos. Giblin, of Hobart
Town, has cleared about 150 acres near Alma at a cost of 30s. an
acre, ringing the large trees, and cutting down and burning small
timber and scrub; on this land, without ploughing, he had for the
first year 40 bushels of oats to the acre. Limestone of an excellent
quality has also been worked here for many years ; and copper ore has
been found near the Castra Settlement. Kangaroos and wallaby are
numerous in the county; emus are occasionally seen; wild ducks, teal,
widgeons, bronze-winged and other pigeons, quail, snipe, plovers, and
other game-birds are plentiful; and the rivers abound in fish and
lobsters, whilst salt-water fish, crayfish, and oysters are procured on
the coast. Coaches are on the road from Launceston along the line to
Westbury and the Mersey; and the new railway line from Launceston
port to Deloraine is completed and in full working order, the traffic
returns showing a very satisfactory result. There is also a railway
from Deloraine to the Mersey port in course of construction. Seven
medical practitioners and two lawyers, an Agricultural Association,
two Benevolent Societies, Cricket Clubs, &c., are established. The
orchards in this county are large and productive. The crop of apples
for market was 8,689 bushels, and pears 584 bushels, fetching from
3s to 6s. a bushel.
The county of Wellington is under the care of a police magistrate,
with a sufficient force at Stanley, the chief post-town, where there is a
money-order office, and the mail communication is three times a week.
It is watered by the rivers Arthur, Hellyer, Horton, Emu, Cam, Mon-


tagu, Black, Duck, Detention, Welcome, Crayfish, Harcus, and Inglis,
besides small rivulets. It consists of seven towns and villages, with
a population of 2,870. Its cattle numbers 7,039 ; horses, 689 ; sheep,
9,585; pigs, 2,304. There is a public library and reading-room, a
printing establishment, 5 public schools, 4 private schools, and 15
churches and chapels. The agricultural lands of the Crown in the
county are reported on as follows: —From the Cam to the Inglis
rivers, the land, as a whole, may be said to be of the richest description
as far back from the coast water-line as had been surveyed or examined.
The immense quantity of good land, and inexhaustible beds of superior
timber between the rivers (all of which run into the sea), are com-
bined with a tolerably good harbour for vessels of light draught.
From the river, for 4 miles west, the land continues of the same
quality, and for about the same distance inland. The land near
Sheffield Plain is of a superior character. South of the Y. D Land
Company’s grant at Circular Head there is some good land of the
usual heavily-timbered myrtle and musk-tree character. Gold in
small quantities has been found in the Hellyer Fiver; coal in various
localities; iron ore and asbestos are also found, and also the black or
mineral sand with which gold is frequently found associated. There
are plenty of kangaroos; and fish of large size, lobsters, crayfish, and
oysters, are obtained in large quantities on the coast.
The county of Buckingham is first in point of importance, because
in it are situated the principal port, and also the seat of the govern-
ment. The principal river watering Buckingham is the Derwent,
which takes its rise in lake St. Clair at an elevation of 3,000 feet
above the sea, has a course of more than 120 miles, and being fed by
numerous other large rivers, is navigable for 24 miles above the port
of the city. There are also the Huon, North-West Bay,. Brown’s,
Bussell’s Falls, Styx, Plenty, Florentine, and Broad rivers, and
numerous rivulets. From this place emanate large quantities of grain,
fruit, and hops; and manufactories of soap, candles, vinegar, starch,
blue, leather, parchment and bone-crushing mills also exist. From
the orchards of this county there were produced last season 34,254
bushels of apples and 12,924 bushels of pears for market, which realised
from 2s. 6d. to ss. per bushel. The county also contains an orphan
asylum, lunatic asylum, and other useful institutions. The mineral
wealth of the district is comprised in limestone, freestone, and
anthracite coal. •
Monmouth contains 28 towns and villages, at eighteen of which are
post-offices. The mail-coach passes through daily from Hobart Town
to Launceston and vice versa. Another coach runs daily to and from
Green Ponds, and one from thence to Bothwell, and also one to Eich-
mond, carrying the mails. The annual value of the property is
£71,000; population, 8,000, occupying 1,520 houses; acres in culti-
vation, 59,343; horses, 2,785; horned cattle, 6,700; sheep, 216,434;
pigs, 5,099. There is a public library at Bothwell with 2,500 vols.,
and one at Green Ponds with 1,500 vols. Sixteen public schools,
11 private schools, 36 churches and chapels. The pastoral lands


belonging to the Crown in this comity are of the tirst-class, 1,200
acres; second-class, 26,000 acres; third-class, 73,000 acres. Coal has
been discovered at Colebrook Dale, Richmond, Constitution Hill, and
Spring Hill. Irrigation of pasture-lands is undertaken on several
farms at Bothwell, from which fat sheep are sent to market. The
kangaroos are numerous in the county; and the wild birds fit for the
sportsman and for the table, are snipe, quail, bronze-winged pigeons,
ducks, and teal, all of which are protected by law during the breeding
season. Rabbits are plentiful. Eels, blackfish, mullet, and trout are
caught in the rivers. In the large orchards of the county, apples,
pears, filberts, walnuts, almonds, peaches, and the smaller fruits grow
in abundance, and form articles of export to Victoria and Sydney;
10,841 bushels of apples and 924 bushels of pears were the produce
of last year, the prices varying from 3s. 6d. to ss. per bushel.
Kent is a densely timbered county, through which, at an enormous
expense, metalled roads and tramways have been made, or are in
course of making, by the Government, and by the various road
trustees. The cultivation is not extensive; but there are very large
and valuable orchards throughout the county, the produce of which
forms a large item of export. There are 14 towns and villages, of
which 8 are post-office stations. Franklin, the chief town, is a money-
order station. The police magistracies of Franklin and Kingborough
maintain a sufficient police, and there are two medical men resident.
The mail communication is three times a week to most of the town-
ships, and once a week to those of minor importance. The annual
value of property is £9,400; population, 2,910, inhabiting 611
houses ; acres in cultivation, 5,096 ; horses, 468 ; cattle, 2,474 ; sheep,
2,884 ; pigs, 1,527. There are 17 schools, and 9 churches and
chapels. The land abounds in various woods suited to cabinet pur-
poses ; and means of transit from one portion of the place to the
other are being provided by the laying of tram lines. Many indica-
tions of extraordinary fertility of soil are observable. This port is
unrivalled as a shipping place. Kangaroos are present in vast numbers,
and they are snared by hundreds for the sake of their skins, which
fetch 15s. to 19s. per dozen in Hobart Town. Wild fowl and fish are
also plentiful. The orchards produced last year 19,621 bushels of
apples, and 194 bushels of pears, fetching about ss. in the market.
The mail coach runs to Franklin three times a week, returning on
alternate days, the fare being about twopence a mile. Large jam
factories exist in Southern Tasmania, the exports in a single year
amounting to 1,491,271 pounds. The chief value of this county is
its timber, the average return from an acre of fairly-timbered land
being stated at 40,000 palings at 605., 100,000 shingles at Bs, ; of
which is paid to the splitter 40s. for the palings, and 4s. for the
shingles.
Pembroke contains 11 towns and villages, 7 being post-office
stations; and Sorell, the principal town, is a money-order office
station. A twice-a-week mail to five townships, and a daily mail to
Sorell, The annual value of property is £18,378; 929 horses, 3,019


cattle, 71,948 sheep, 3,369 pigs; acres in cultivation, 22,339. Popu-
lation upwards of 4,055, inhabiting 693 houses. Nine public schools,
five private schools, and twelve churches and chapels. Kangaroos and
wild game-birds are plentiful; and very fine fish, crayfish, and oysters
are caught along the coast. The steamers to and from Victoria pass
along the coast of Pembroke. Several small vessels trade with the
various ports on the coast, and with Sorell and Pittwater. Maria
Island is a few miles from the coast. Excellent freestone is quarried
in the county near Spring Bay, and exported to Victoria; and there
is also an export trade in dried fish and crayfish, which are largely
used by the Chinese people in Victoria. The lands belonging to the
Crown in this county are not adapted to cultivation, being occupied
principally as sheep-runs. Nearly all the lands have been granted or
sold to settlers, and in the cultivated districts of Sorell and Pittwater
are some of the finest and oldest settled farms of the colony. The
convenience of water-carriage is so great, and the rich valleys so pro-
ductive, that the southern part of Pembroke is almost one great grain
country. For fifty years it has had the reputation of producing the
finest bacon, cheese, and wheat of Tasmania.
Glamorgan contains five townships, all sea-ports, and two Customs
stations. At Swansea there is a money-order office. The Glamorgan
rural municipality has its warden, two medical men, and a sufficient
police. The principal post-towns are Swansea, Bicheno, and Seymour,
the mail communication with which is twice a week, and some small
schooners trade between the ports and Hobart Town, and during the
fruit season vessels are usually laid on for Victoria. Two colliers also
ply between the Seymour Coal Mines and Hobart Town. The annual
value of property is £6,550 ; population 1,061, inhabiting 235
houses; acres in cultivation, 5,168; horses, 424; cattle, 1,866;
sheep, 37,705 ; pigs, 1,543. The extensive orchards of the county
produced last season 5,867 bushels of apples, and 286 of pears fur
market—the price ranging from 2s. to ss. a bushel. There is a public
library, agricultural association, one private and three public schools,
and six churches and chapels. The lands of the Crown in this county
are not extensive, and are situated either immediately at the back of
lands sold or granted along the coast-line, or are hedged in by the
high rough hills which compose the greatest part of this county.
There are fertile spots among these hills of more than ordinary value ;
and the valleys running down to the sea, being sheltered and rich, are
well calculated for orchards, or for small dairy farms. The east coast
cider, honey, butter, and cheese hold a high place in the estimation of
consumers. Coal, of an excellent quality, is worked at Seymour.
Kangaroos and game birds are plentiful, especially ducks, quail,
and black swans. The finest salt-water fish, crayfish, and oysters are
found all along the coast.
The county of Arthur in the western range embraces the noble
harbour at Port Davey, from whence quantities of the best pine
timber are brought to market. It is also well provided with water
further inland. Some valuable minerals are here supposed to exist,


and with the fine timber, the convenient water-power for the working
of saw-mills, and the admirable port for shipment, it is expected to
eventuate in success, more especially in the building and cabinet-
making trades.
The counties of Russell, Franklin, Montagu, and Montgomery are
also included in the western portion.
The Eldon Ranges are in these counties, also the Frenchman’s Cap
and Mount Arrowsmith, near all of which gold has been found in
small quantities in the extensive quartzite formation covering the
whole of the western country, where is also the finest marble, slate,
and limestone and coal. Here and there along the banks of the
Gordon are alluvial lands heavily timbered, and also along the
Franklin river for half-a-dozen miles, the produce from which could
be brought to the port in flat-bottomed boats or barges. Extensive
open marshes in places afford moderate pasture, and are susceptible of
the same improvement which is found to follow continuous burning
and stocking in other parts of the colony. A road extends from
Hamilton to the great bend of the river Gordon; and the line of
country between that point and the point of navigation on the river
Franklin’s junction with the Gordon river, about 25 miles, appears
for the most part to be, although broken, free from scrub. In the
King’s river drift gold has been found, and traces of copper have
been obtained in the Franklin river.
In the fastnesses of this wild and uncultivated country the hyaena,
or native tiger, is found, and also the native devil, both of which
used formerly to be so destructive to sheep. Wombats and kangaroos
are plentiful, and also water fowl.
The harbours are, however, dangerous from the fearful surf caused
by the swell of the Southern Ocean, which beats up in windy
weather, and the bars of sand at their entrance. The climate of the
western coast is much more humid than that of any other part of the
colony. The valley of the Collingwood river for more than 10 miles
looks like a park studded with plantations of timber; the marshes are
bounded on each side by steep declivities, on which the quartz rock
crops out like battlements.
The G ordon and Loddon plains are open and undulating, intersected
with belts of wood; and good gas-coal is also found.
Of the central counties, Cumberland comes first. It contains eight
towns and villages, four of them being post-stations. Within its
borders is the rural municipality of Hamilton, with a warden and a
sufficient police. The principal town is Hamilton, which is a post-
office money-order station, and to which there is a mail three
times a week. The annual value of property is £20,000 ; population,
about 1,500; acres in cultivation, 6,578 ; horses, 1,077; cattle,
10,034; sheep, 152,682; pigs, 1,096. Four public schools, and
seven churches and chapels.
The pastoral lands belonging to the Crown are reported by Mr,
Crawford to be 14,800 acres first-class, 23,600 second-class, and
25,000 third-class. The main roads under the Great Lake Road


Trust, and leading to the Lake District, are in good order. The sheep
lands in the Lake District are of great extent, level, and marshy; and
the expense of draining them would vary from 2s. to ss. an acre.
Where the trees have been barked and destroyed, at an expense of
Is. or 2s. per acre, a considerable improvement has been effected in
the herbage; and it also has had the effect of ameliorating the
climate of these elevated lands, which, being so keen, and suffering
from summer frosts, are unfit for cereal agricultural operations; root-
crops would flourish. These high lands are principally rented by
large sheep-owners in the lower districts for the purpose of sending
their flocks up in December, after being shorn and regulated, for
which purpose they are usually brought down in October and
November. These lands form a fine pastoral country, which would
be greatly enhanced in value by a proper system of drainage. The
river Shannon rises in the Great Lake, a sheet of water 50 miles in
circumference, or about 50,000 acres. When the wind is high it acts
on the water so as to make the Shannon overflow its banks. There
is a horse-track or a marked road to the other lakes, some of which
are extensive sheets of fresh water, where the sportsman can find
black swans, pigeons, teal, wild ducks, &c.,in quantities, and on their
green margins the finest specimens of kangaroos in the island.
On the borders of Lake Sorell are found amethysts, topazes, and
rock-crystals of great beauty. One beach glistens so much with the
small particles as to be named the Diamond Beach, Bituminous coal
has been discovered at Hamilton 30 feet from the surface, and worked
for use; it is also found at the Ouse, under a bed of pipe-clay. The
county has evidently, many thousand years ago, suffered from volcanic
agency; and jasper, obsidian, opalized wood, and scoriae are abundant.
In the rivers are mullet, eels, black fish, trout, English brown trout,
and platypus; and kangaroo and game birds abound. The white
gum-trees produce manna from October to February; and black
cockatoos, white cockatoos, and richly-coloured parrots are very
numerous, the white cockatoos sometimes coming down on the
newly-sown grain-fields resembling a sheet of snow.
The county of Lincoln is described as being very wild and moun-
tainous. No towns or villages have as yet been laid out. Indications
of gold have been discovered. There are 40,000 acres of Crown land,
but it is chiefly of an inferior character.
The midland pastoral county is that of Somerset. It contains ten
towns and villages, all of which have daily mail communication with
the city. The total of acres under cultivation is 19,426 ; population,
5,550. It is a large sheep-growing county. There are 16 schools and
29 churches and chapels. The Crown lands extend to some 150,000
acres, about three-fourths of which are of good quality. A portion of
marsh land also exists, which is said to be rather baneful to the sheep.
There is plenty of good white freestone for building at Boss. In
the rivers, mullet, black-fish, eels, trout, &c., are found, also platypus
and otters; the birds of every sort are numerous, especially ducks,
pigeons, quail, snipe, kingfishers, parrots, and cockatoos. The


orchards produced 2,700 bushels of apples, and 153 of pears for
market, at 4s. to ss. a bushel, in 1869. Tobacco for sheep-dressing
was largely grown in 1868. Kangaroos of every size are plentiful;
and rabbits are so numerous in the Campbell Town and Ross districts,
that it is not unusual for a shooting party of three to kill several
hundreds in an afternoon. On some farms the bodies of the rabbits
are boiled down as food for the pigs. In other parts the skins are
taken off and sent to market, or are used by the men on the farms for
rugs and bedding.
The county of Westmoreland is a midland pastoral and agricultural
county of a hilly character, on the plateaus of which are the Great
Lake (50 miles in circumference, covering 50,000 acres, and 3,822
feet above the sea), the Nineteen Lagoons, Western Lagoon, Arthur’s
Lake (15,000 acres, 3,388 feet above the sea), and Wood’s Lake. It
is also watered by the Lake and Lilfey rivers, and several rivulets.
Fourteen towns and villages have been laid out and built upon, of
which eight are post-towns. The electric telegraph extends to Long-
ford and Westbury ; and the Western Railway line runs through
Perth, Longford, and Westbury, conveying the mails twice daily.
Sixteen public and 21 private schools, and 29 churches and chapels.
The population is 11,537, inhabiting 2,217 houses; the annual value
of property, £81,683; acres in cultivation, 71,855 ; horses, 4,705;
cattle, 15,504; sheep, 277,028; pigs, 8,538. The orchards produced
10,350 bushels of apples, and 659 bushels of pears for market, at
from 2s. 6d. to ss. a bushel. The pastoral lands belonging to the
Crown in Westmoreland county, which have been examined by Mr.
Crawford, are reported as follows : First-class, 43,200 acres ; second,
49,100 acres; third, 39,000 acres; a very fair proportion of marsh
lands and good sound open grassy lands. The marshes may be
improved by drainage, and the rocky uplands by burning off the
scrub and ringing the trees : in those instances where these have been
done by the proprietors or lessees, the herbage has been improved to a
considerable extent. county is famous for its very large
kangaroos. Occasionally emus are seen; black swans and wild ducks
are numerous, and all the other game-birds. The English salmon-
trout and tench fish have been placed in the lakes with a view to
their culture. In this county there are a public library of 1,260 vols.
at Westbury, and one of 700 vols at Longford; two Working Men’s
Clubs, a Penny Savings Bank ; a Building Society; Friendly Benefit
Societies ; Oddfellows’ Lodges ; Ploughing Associations ; Agricultural
Associations ; Benevolent Association ; Cricket Clubs ; Archery Club,
&c. &c.
Tasmania is said to be a remunerative speculation on the part of the
domestic servant, the farm labourer, and the small capitalist. Most
of the cereals produce good crops in the country. With regard to the
farm labourer, statistics say that at home his wages would vary from
ss. to 15s. a week, with some vegetables from the homestead, and a
room for his family in a small cottage, whilst here the same man
would obtain from Bs. to 13s. 6d. a week wages; and, in addition


thereto, cottage, firing, water, and about the following weekly rations
of food, which vary on different farms, but are fully as follows : —lO
to 12 lbs. of meat, 14 lbs. of flour, 2 lbs. of sugar, \ lb. tea, and
skim-milk for his children. He has only to show an interest in his
master’s service, and be sober and honest, and his labours will be duly
appreciated by occasional presents of fruit, cider, &c. He has visiting
clergymen, if not close to a church; he has public schools in every
district open to his children at about 6d. per week; medical men and
doctors’ shops scattered through the colony—these latter, however, do
not flourish in the healthy interior. His hours of labour are not more
than 60 a week at the furthest; and during shearing time or harvest
there is always remunerative employment for his children down to 6
or 7 years of age—and the bit of rich ground for his potato or turnip
bed for his household, and his pig, is never stinted. There is a good
demand for boys of 12 to 14, who have gained a slight knowledge of
farming and milking. The next class is the Household Servant,
whose labours are the same here as in England, but whose wages and
advantages are much greater. A respectable female servant can get
from £ls to £3O a year according to her abilities; and a good cook
and laundress will get higher wages; the alternate Sunday afternoon
out is usually allowed, with the wages paid monthly; the occasional
holiday for a working man’s club trip or picnic; and, if well-behaved
and proper in her conduct, an almost certainty of a respectable man
for a husband. A good sober man-servant in a household receives
high wages, if he is inclined to make himself generally useful; while
a steady attentive nursemaid is always sure of a good place with every
comfort; for in a large family the little ones are greatly entrusted to
the nursemaids in their walks and in their nurseries, and any careless-
ness or neglect carry with them oftentimes serious consequences.
There are only certain classes of the population required in Tasmania
at present, and these are : 1. Men with capital to invest, either as
resident or absentee capitalists. 2. Agricultural labourers, or persons
accustomed to field labour or dairy farming. 3. Domestic servants,
either male or female. There are plenty of mechanics, artizans, clerks,
book-keepers, grooms, coachmen, dressmakers, and needlewomen, shop-
men and shopwomen. Any of these classes coming to Tasmania would
not find the market for their labour so remunerative as it might be in
Canada, or in some other of the British colonies. The educational
establishments of Tasmania are, and have been for many years, such
that the son of the poorest hutholder, if the boy possesses talent,
might hope to become a member of the Legislature, or to fill the
highest offices in the State or in the Church; and there is a strong
current of that Scottish feeling in the colony which induces the
parent to give a child the best education he or she can afford, and in
90 cases out of 100 to deny luxuries in a household, so that a good
education may be afforded to all the little ones ; many parents well
% knowing that the only provision they can make for their children is
an education, coupled possibly with a small life policy. Eamilies in
Tasmania range larger than in England or Europe, or in the warmer


Australian colonies, the average of households being about 5 children,
whilst families of 13 or 14 are not unfrequent.
The vegetable produce has been up to the present very fair, although
not equal to its capabilities, and this by reason of the inefficient
farming operations not unfrequently found in new countries. Wheat,
sugar-beet, timber, tobacco, flax, opium poppy, olives, leather, fruit,
wool, and dairy produce are amongst the objects of trade. Of the
mineral products coal, both anthracite and bituminous, abounds in
many places, whilst gold, slate, marble, iron ore, and stone are also
present in greater or less quantities. Other important industries in-
clude whaling and deep-sea fishing. In order to encourage trade, large
bonuses have been offered for sugar and other products in Tasmania,
also for salt, corn sacks, woollen stuffs, &c.
In concluding this notice of Tasmania, it may be said that the high
price of labour, low price of wheat, and other circumstances, have lately
led to a better system of farming, in which fallowing and rotation of
crops occupy a prominent place; and the breeding of pure stock—•
sheep, cattle, horses, pigs, &c.—for which the climate is peculiarity
adapted, and which are always in demand in the other colonies,
forms one of the most profitable branches of agricultural and pastoral
farming.

THE DOMINION OF CANADA
Occupies a very important place in the ranks of suitable emigrant
stations, and notwithstanding that there has been a continuous influx
of persons from Great Britain and other countries, there is still ample
space for emigrants, especially of the agricultural class. Proofs of the
success of those who have gone out during the past ten years are not
wanting, inasmuch as at least one-fourth of them have sent for their
friends to join them. To briefly run over the geographical positions of
Canada and its provinces, it may be stated that the dominion of
Canada comprises a vast territory of about 3,528,705 square miles. It
occupies half of the continent of North America. From east to west


it stretches from the Atlantic to the Pacific oceans; and its extreme
southern point reaches a little below the forty-second parallel of lati-
tude. It occupies a greater area than the United States of America.
Very large portions of this territory are cultivable; and the other
portions are rich in mineral and other kinds of wealth. The propor-
tion of cultivable land suited to the productions of the temperate zone
to the uncultivahle is greater in the Dominion than in the United
States. Its rivers and lakes form one of the chief physical features of
the continent. Its rivers are among the largest and most remarkable
in the world; and its fresh-water lakes are altogether the largest and
most remarkable in the world. It possesses many thousands of square
miles of the finest and richest forests of the continent; and many
thousands of square miles of the most fertile prairie land. It possesses
the largest extent of land yet open for settlement, adapted to the
growth of grasses and cereals, and other productions of the temperate
climates, not only on this continent, but in the world. Fisheries of
boundless extent, unequalled on the continent, if not in the world,
exist both on its Atlantic and Pacific coasts; its coal-fields are of
immense extent in the provinces on both of its coasts; and it is
believed that altogether the largest coal deposits of the world lie under
the surface of its rich and immense tracts of prairie land east of the
Eocky Mountains. It has gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, and other
mines of great richness ; and almost every description of the most
valuable building materials; also petroleum, salt, peat, &c. The
immense rivers and lakes of the Dominion furnish the grandest facili-
ties for water communication. The sailing circle, from the mouth of
the St. Lawrence to Europe, gives much the shortest distance across
the Atlantic. The line across the continent to the Pacific is much the
shortest for a railway; the conditions for its construction are the most
favourable; and the passes through the Eocky Mountains are the
easiest. On the Pacific coast it has the same favourable commercial
conditions, with the finest harbours. The water system of the St.
Lawrence and the great lakes constitutes one of the most marked
features in the geographical formation of North America, and leads
directly from the Atlantic to the north-west of the Dominion. And
from the head of Lake Superior, with the exception of a few interrup-
tions, which can he easily overcome by canals, another system of lakes
and rivers extends navigation across the continent to the foot of the
Eocky Mountains, by means of which the products, in the future, of
this immense territory, will be borne to the seaboard. More than
5.000 miles of railway are already in operation within the Dominion,
1.000 more miles are in process of construction, and many more are
projected, besides the Pacific Eailway, which is to he built imme-
diately, and the length of which will he 2,500 miles. It has great
variety of climates, from the arctic to that of almost the southern of
the temperate zone, modified by the influence of the great lakes. The
climates of the settled portions of the Dominion are said to be amongst
the most pleasant and healthy in the world, and favourable to the
highest development of human energy. From these facts, one writer


says, the Dominion of Canada must, in the not far distant future,
become the home of one of the most populous and powerful peoples of
the earth. It is divided into seven provinces; viz., Nova Scotia, New
Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, and
British Columbia, together with the vast unorganized North-West Terri-
tory, out of which, in time, other provinces will come to be formed.
The form of government in Canada is probably the freest in the world.
There is no hereditary aristocracy; the source of all power is the
people, tempered and guided by the constitutional forms of the mother
country. Society, too, is less marked by the distinctions of caste than
in Britain. The various counties and townships have all their local
governments, and the franchise practically extends to every house-
holder. The utmost religious liberty everywhere prevails, and means
of education are extended to all. Criminal and civil law is practised
as in England, and the judges similarly appointed.
As to the climate of Canada, much has been said as to the rigour of
its winters. It is true the winters are decided, and snow, in many
parts, covers the ground to the depth of two or three feet; but there
are great advantages in this —the snow is perfectly dry and packs
under foot, making the best roads, and forming a warm covering for
the earth. The dry winter atmosphere is bracing and pleasant. The
sun shines brightly by day, and the moon and stars by night, during
by far the greatest part of the time. And, besides being pleasant,
there is no healthier climate under the sun. There are no endemic
diseases in Canada. The sensation of cold is far more unpleasant
during the damp days (such as mark the winters in England) than
when the winter regularly sets in. The summers, like the winters, are
also of decided character, being, in the main, warm and bright; and
fruits and vegetables which cannot be ripened in the open air in
England, will here ripen to perfection. And the grand fact is that
they are much more favourable for the horticulturist and the agricul-
turist than those of England, with the single exception of length of
time in which out-door w r ork can be done, but this is fully made up
by the greater number of days in which men can be employed out of
doors during the season, and the greater rapidity with which hay,
grain, &c., can be won and housed.
The Dominion seems to be specially fitted to supply the United
Kingdom with the farm produce which it is necessary for her to im-
port. The old provinces can supply her with horses and beef and
mutton, and Manitoba and the north-west with wheat. The general
healthiness of the climate and the favourable conditions for feeding all
kinds of stock which prevail in the provinces of Ontario, Quebec, New
Brunswick, and P. E. Island, together with the immense areas
available, leave no room to doubt the accuracy of this latter statement.
And the vast areas in Manitoba and the north-west now being brought
into play will furnish her, as well as other importing countries, an
almost illimitable supply of cereals. The great strength as well as the
great wealth of the Dominion of Canada rests in her soil; her
minerals are of undoubted value ; her fisheries are the finest in the


world; her manufactures are not insignificant, and must continue to
increase; yet it is not on these she must chiefly rely for future great-
ness. She has one attraction greater than all others combined, and
that attraction is her broad forest lands and her rich, rolling prairies.
Agriculture is her strength. Fortunately there can be no doubt as to
the result. Though a young and new country, as compared with
others, she is already known the civilised world over as a great meat
and corn-producing country. Her staples have a character and a
standing abroad such as her people have no reason to he ashamed of.
There is no more independent man in the world than the Canadian
farmer; he may not have so much wealth as some English farmers,
he may not be in a position to cultivate his land to such a degree of
perfection, and he may not have so many of the social advantages;
yet, as a rule, he is a happier, a more contented, and a more indepen-
dent man. His land is his own absolutely. His taxes are light; his
family are well to do ; he is the equal in every respect (not unfrequently
the superior) of the most successful persons in the towns near by. In
a new country like Canada it would be absurd generally to look for
scientific farming as carried on in England. As land is abundant and
labour scarce, a great breadth of land is cultivated, hut in what high
English farmers would consider a rough sort of way. This is the
rule, hut there are exceptions. In the province of Ontario there is a
School of Agriculture, connected with a model farm, at which scientific
and practical agriculture is taught. There are also model farms in the
province of Quebec. The result is a marked improvement of late
years in the style of farming in some parts of the country.
The field crops which are purchased are wheat, oats, barley, rye,
Indian corn, potatoes, turnips, mangel wurzel, peas, buckwheat, flax,
&c. ; and amongst the garden fruits and vegetables are all more par-
ticularly English, as well as tomatoes, melons, grapes, &c. Machinery
is very largely in use all over the Dominion, and this is accounted for
by the fact that working hours are more limited than in England.
That farming pays in Canada is proven by the greater number engaged
in it than in any other other branch of industry. One return gives
463,424 persons engaged in Ontario, out of which 228,708 were
devoted to agriculture ; in Quebec, 160,041 out of a total of 341,291 ;
Hew Brunswick, 40,394 out of 86,488; and in Nova Scotia, 49,769
out of 118,645, which gives nearly one-half of the people as being of
the farming class.
A very important branch of farming in certain parts of Canada is
fruit growing. It is very generally thought by persons not familiar
with the country that, owing to the severity of the winter, fruits
cannot he successfully cultivated, except to a very limited extent, and
at a great cost. There is no foundation, in fact, for such an impression.
On the contrary, in the production of such kinds of fruit as belong to
the temperate zone, Canada cannot well he surpassed. The character
of the soil in many districts is suitable for the apple, plum, pear, &c.;
while in the hot summer sun the peach and grape reach maturity and
develop fruit having many points of excellence. A hardy kind of grape.


which has been successfully crossed into the European varieties, grows
wild in the woods; the strawberry, raspberry, and gooseberry, and
other small fruits, grow in profusion in all the older provinces. The
red plum is also indigenous to the soil. In specially-favoured regions,
such as the Niagara district, peach orchards many acres in extent are
to he seen. The peach crop is not always a successful one; hut gene-
rally speaking, there is a good yield every second year. Though it is
anything but probable that Canada will ever rival European countries
in the character of her wine, nevertheless her vineyards are increasing
in number year by year, and good, wholesome wines are being made.
Experience is all that is necessary to develop this into an important
industry.
In connection with dairy farming, great progress has been made in
Canada of late years. Not long since the cheese manufactured in the
country was not sufficient to supply the local demand; whereas there
are now cheese factories by the score in the provinces of Ontario and
Quebec.
“American” cheese, as it is all called, is well known in England;
but very few people are aware of the fact that the best “ American ”
cheese is made in Canada. In the window of a cheesemonger’s shop
in Ludgate Hill, London, Canadian Stilton and Canadian Cheddar
are constantly exhibited; and so well do they suit the palates of
Englishmen, that many persons prefer them to the English articles
after which they are named. The Canadian cheese is, in fact, the
very best made on the American continent. The cattle are of the
very best breeds, the pasture is excellent, and the work is cleanly and
carefully done.
Butter-making is also largely carried on. Millions of pounds are
exported each year, and the quality is excellent. Near the large
towns market gardening is profitably carried on. A comparatively
small capital is necessary, and with industry and perseverance, backed
up by experience, a good income is assured. Like everything else
however, none but those who have had experience in Canada should
attempt it. Poultry raising is only beginning to be much looked
after, probably because poultry is so cheap. In course of time
however, as the market extends, and as means are found of exporting
fowls, geese, and turkeys to England, henneries on a large scale will
be established. The exportation has already begun. Bee keeping
too is profitably carried on in many parts. These few points show
that what may be termed the smaller branches of farming are not
neglected by the Canadian husbandman. Still much remains to be
done in this respect.
Having spoken of the capabilities of the land, let me proceed to
speak generally of the land system in Canada. Though free grants
of land are practically to be procured in all parts of the Dominion,
the system is not the same in all the provinces, as will be seen from
appended particulars.
Nova Scotia. —ln this province there are about 10,000,000 acres,
b 3


nearly one-fifth part of which consists of lakes and rivers. Of the
whole extent, about 5,000,000 acres are fit for cultivation. Wild
lands may he obtained from the Government for about Is. 9d. sterling
per acre. Here, as in all the other provinces, the purchase of land
carries with it the ownership of all minerals found therein.
Hew Brunswick. —This province contains 17,347,360 acres, of
which 13,000,000 are fit for cultivation, with only some 730,000
under actual improvement. The Lieutenant-Governor in Council may
cause eligible portions of Crown lands to be selected for settlement.
One hundred acres of land so surveyed may be located to immigrants
or other male settlers, of the age of eighteen years and upwards, who
do not own other land in the province, upon the follow r ing terms and
conditions, viz. : “ On payment of twenty dollars cash in advance, to
aid in the construction of roads and bridges in the vicinity of his
location, or upon his performing labour on such roads and bridges to
the extent of ten dollars per year for three years, as may be directed
by the Governor in Council or officer appointed to superintend the
same. He shall commence improving his location immediately after
obtaining permission to occupy the same, and shall, within two years
thereafter, satisfy the Governor in Council that he has built a house
thereon of not less dimensions than sixteen by twenty feet, and is
residing thereon, and that he has cleared at least two acres of the said
land. He shall continue to reside upon said land for three consecutive
years, at the expiration of which time, provided he shall have cleared
and cultivated at least ten acres of said land, and performed the
labour in the manner hereinbefore prescribed, or paid twenty dollars
in advance, a grant shall issue to him of the one hundred acres so
located as aforesaid; provided always that, should the means of such
person locating as aforesaid be limited, he may from time to time, and
for reasonable periods, absent himself from said land in order to
procure the means of support for himself and family without forfeit-
ing his claim to constant residence.” Under this system several
colonies of English and Scotch emigrants have been settled in Hew
Brunswick within the past few years.
Quebec covers a territory of 210,000 square miles in round
numbers, or about 120,000,000 acres, 10,678,931 acres of which have
been conceded in fiefs and seigniories, 8,950,953 acres are held in the
townships in free and common socage, and 6,400,359 acres are
divided into farm lots. There remain about one hundred millions of
acres of land still to be surveyed. The Government are in a position
to offer for colonization 6,400,000 acres of land, divided into farm
lots, nearly half of which are accessible by means of good roads, and
more than two-thirds are fit for settlement. The price of these farms
varies from twenty to sixty cents per acre (lOd. to 2s. 6d. sterling).
Upon eight of the great colonization roads, every male colonist and
emigrant, being at least eighteen years of age, may obtain a free grant
of 100 acres. The number of acres of land at present set aside to be


disposed of in free grants is 84,050 ; but the Lieutenant-Governor in
Council may increase the quantity if found necessary. By the
end of the fourth year, the grantee must build a habitable dwell-
ing on his lot and have twelve acres under cultivation; he can then
take out letters patent which make him absolute proprietor. The
Lieutenant :Governor in Council may at any time lay aside a district
of country for the purpose of establishing a colony or settlement of
persons who come to the province as one party. There is in the
province of Quebec a homestead law, under which the immigrant’s
property, on certain conditions, is exempt from seizure.
Ontario. —This province has a territory of 200,000 square miles,
or 69,000,000 acres, and Crown lands may be purchased at one
shilling an acre and upwards, according to situation. The free grant
system is as follows : “ Every head of a family can obtain gratis two
hundred acres of land, and any person eighteen years of age may
obtain one hundred acres in the free grant districts. This offer is
made by the Government to all persons, without distinction of sex, so
that a large family having several children at or past 18 years of age,
may take up a large tract, and become in a few years, when the land
shall have been cleared and improved, joint possessors of a valuable
and beautiful estate. The settlement duties are :To have 15 acres on
each grant of 100 acres cleared and under crop in five years ; to build
a habitable house, at least 16 by 20 feet in size ; and to reside on the
land at least six months in each year.” The patent is not issued till
the end of five years. There is a homestead law in force in Ontario
whereby the land of the settler is protected from seizure for a certain
number of yesfrs, and thus possessed for his family, no matter what
financial difficulty he may get into.
Manitoba. —Free grants of land are only given in alternate sections
here, and this in consequence of the scheme for building the Canadian
Pacific Eailway by the proceeds of sales of lands having altered the
old system of obtaining lands.
British Columbia. —In this province the law defines that any male
person being a British subject, and having attained the age of 18, may
acquire the right to pre-empt any unoccupied, unsurveyed, and un-
reserved Crown lands (not being an Indian settlement), not exceeding
320 acres, to the north and east of the Cascades, and 160 acres in the
rest of the colony. A fee of two dollars is to be paid for the record
of such pre-emption. The occupation shall be a continuous bond fide
residence for four years, and when the lands are surveyed the price
shall not exceed one dollar per acre, and the pre-emptor shall have the
right to buy his claim. The upset price of surveyed lands is one
dollar per acre. Leases to any extent of unpre-empted and unsurveyed
lands, for pastures, or cutting timber, spars, &c., and of 500 acres for
cutting hay, may be granted by the Governor in Council, subject to
such rent, terms, &c., as the Governor in Council may order.


Educational systems are complete in these provinces, as well as
postal, money order, telegraph, and banking facilities.
The important question of wages, cost of living, rent, clothing, &c.,
cannot he given with any degree of accuracy in consequence of the
derangement experienced in the depression of 1874, and following
years. This, however, is passing away, and the Dominion is resuming
its wonted position of prosperity. In the old parts of Canada
labourers’ wages may be stated to be from eighty cents, to a dollar a
day, without board ; and this is somewhat less in the winter. Agri-
cultural labourers get from ten to twenty dollars per month with
board, and more for special work during the harvest, but in winter
less. Labourers’ wages on the railway works in Manitoba and the
north-west are from one dollar and a quarter to two dollars a day. But
emigrants should bear in mind that Manitoba is a new country, and
the labour market limited. They should therefore be well advised
before going thither in search of employment. Female domestic
servants get on an average five or six dollars a month with board.
Higher wages are sometimes paid for very superior servants. Inferior
ones get less than the average stated. The wages of artizans and
mechanics differ with their trades, and are in many cases fixed by the
trades union. As compared with the cost of living they are good ;
and they are relatively good as compared with other countries. It may
be generally remarked that, since the depression began, the class of
mechanics and artizans and labourers in towns have been cautioned to
use great care before emigrating, as considerable numbers, not only in
Canada, but over the whole continent of North America, have been
thrown out of employment, from the stoppage or reduction of accus-
tomed industries. These remarks have not applied in Canada to
genuine agricultural labourers. These, and farmers with small capital,
have had the very best prospects open to them, even during the crisis.
In fact, men, to make the land give its increase and develop the
mineral resources of the country, are a standing need in Canada. As
respects the cost of living, it has gone down with the depression of
wages. All kinds of meat, potatoes, bread, butter, milk, cheese, and,
in fact, all kinds of provisions are very cheap in Canada, very much
cheaper than they are in England; and the people as a rule live well.
Generally speaking, the cost of clothing is cheaper in the old country
than in the new, and provisions cheaper in the new than the old; but
the difference in the cost of clothing at the present time is not much;
and the emigrant is not advised to burden himself by the purchase of
articles of which he is not in immediate need.
The cost of board for immigrants may be stated to average from two
dollars and a half to three dollars (10s. to 12s. stg.) per week ; and the
rent of houses for working men from five dollars stg.) to eight
dollars {£\ 12s. stg.) per month, according to size and locality.
There are, of course, higher and lower prices than these quotations.
Living is very cheap in Canada.
As regards employment, the newly-arrived immigrant, without
means, is generally advised to take the first offer made to him until he


becomes acquainted with the ways of the country. And the induce-
ment, as before explained, to come to Canada is not simply higher
wages and good living among kindred people under the same flag,
in a naturally rich country, possessing a pleasant and healthy climate;
but the confident hope which the poorest may have of becoming a
landowner, and, while securing a competency for himself, comfortably
settling and educating his children in a manner he could not hope to
do among the crowded population of the old country.
Ontario is the most populous and wealthy province of the Con-
federation. According to recent returns it had a population of
about 1,700,000, and its general growth has been very rapid. Its
chief occupation is agriculture. Toronto, which is the seat of the
provincial government, has a population of some 57,000. There are
also other large cities; viz., Ottawa, with a population of 21,600;
Hamilton, with 26,716; London, 15,826 ; and Kingston, 12,407.
Its mineral resources include iron, copper, lead, salt, petroleum,
marble, silver, and it is besides an essentially agricultural country.
Female domestic servants, as well as dressmakers, milliners, and seam-
stresses, are always sure of immediate employment, but it is impressed
upon intending emigrants that of clerks, professional men, and
bookkeepers, there is already enough and to spare.
Uncleared land varies in price from 2s. to 40s. an acre, according to
situation and soil. Cleared and improved farms can be bought at
prices ranging from to £lO an acre. The money can nearly
always be paid in instalments, covering several years. The leasing of
farms is an exception to the general rule, as most men desire to own
the land they cultivate. Emigrants possessing means would do well
not to be in haste to purchase, but to get some experience before taking
so important a step. Agricultural labourers would study their own
interests by accepting employment as it may be offered on arrival, and
they will soon learn how to improve permanently their condition.
Persons accustomed to the use of mechanical tools, who intend turning
their hands to farming, will often find such an acquisition of great
convenience and value.
Free grant lands are also given. On January Ist, 1874, there were
sixty-nine townships open for location, under the “ Free Grant and
Homestead Act of 1868,” and the following have been opened since
that time; viz., Bangor, Faraday, McClure, Carling, Ryde, Oakley,
Ridout, Mattawan, and Plumer, making in all seventy-eight townships,
each containing from 50,000 to 60,000 acres. Besides the above, there
are twelve more townships appropriated, making in all ninety. Other
townships will be opened as railways and colonization roads are con-
structed; and the Georgian Bay branch of the Canadian Pacific
Railway will, in its construction, pass through townships in Ontario
that will be open to settlers as free grants. Two hundred acres of
land can be obtained, on condition of settlement, by every head of a
family having children under eighteen years of age; and any person
over eighteen years of age can obtain a free grant of 100 acres on
condition of settlement. These lands are protected from seizure


for any debt incurred before the issue of the patent, and for twenty
years after its issue, by a “ Homestead Exemption Act.” In order to
make a successful settlement upon a free grant, the settler should have
at least from to after reaching his location. The old settlers
are always willing to help new-comers. A house, such as is required
by the Act, could be erected by contract for from £5 to £8 ; but
with the assistance which the new settler would certainly receive from
his neighbours, it might be erected for even less. Should it be desired
to clear the land by hired labour or by contract, in order to bring it
more rapidly into cultivation, the cost would be about £3 sterling per
acre. The best season of the year to go on to a free grant is the
month of September, after harvest work in the old settlements is over.
There is time to put up a house, and get comfortably settled before
the winter sets in; and during the winter the work of chopping and
clearing can go on. In this way a crop can be got in during the first
spring. The operation of putting in the first crop is a very simple
one. Ploughing is at once impracticable and unnecessary. The land
is light and rich. All it needs is a little scratching on the surface to
cover the seed. This is done with a drag or harrow, which may
either be a very rough, primitive implement—a natural crotch with a
few teeth in it —or it may be carefully made and well finished.
The climate is warmer in summer and colder in winter than that of
England, Cereals, grasses, and root-crops find their appropriate
climate, and fruits abound; whilst hemp, tobacco, and sugar beet are
also profitable crops. Maize and tomatoes ripen well, and in the
southern parts peaches and grapes come to perfection in the open air.
Of manufactories, many are springing up around in consequence of the
admirable facilities offered in the abundance of water. The principal
articles manufactured are cloth, linen, clothing, leather, furniture, sawn
timber, flax, iron and hardware, paper, soap, cotton and woollen goods,
steam engines and locomotives, wooden ware of all descriptions, agri-
cultural implements, &c.
Special inducements are held out to persons of means by reason of
the high rates of interest obtainable, and the valuable security offered
for money, the minimum percentage being 7or 8. To this are added
the fact that living and education are cheaper. It also affords attrac-
tions to tenant farmers, as it is said that for the cost of leasing a farm
in England, the freehold of a similar plot could be purchased in
Ontario.
Quebec comprises a territory of 210,000 square miles or 129,000,000
acres of land, of which 26,029,934 acres have already been surveyed,
leaving 102,970,066 still to be surveyed.
At the last census the population of Quebec amounted to 1,191,516
souls; of these 929,817 were of French origin, 69,822 of English,
49,458 of Scotch, 123,478 of Irish, and the remainder of other origins.
The soil of the province is extremely rich, and adapted to the growth
of very varied products, and cattle breeding is carried on to a very
large extent.
The great bulk of the rural population live by agriculture. The


extent of the farms generally is 100 acres; farms in the older settle-
ments being worth, as a rule, from 2,000 to 4,000 dols. The sons of
farmers invariably push hack into the new settlements, where a
partially cleared farm may he purchased for about 200 dols.; or
purchase a lot from the Crown lands at a cost of between 30 or 40
cents (Is. 3d. to Is. Bd. stg.) per acre; or take a free grant along one
of the colonization roads. There are five main centres of colonization :
The Valley of the Saguenay —The extent of land surveyed and dis-
posable in this district is about 616,600 acres, the price of which is
about 20 cents (lOd. stg.) per acre; The Valley of the St. Maurice —■
There are, in the townships of this district surveyed, divided into farm
lots, 411,200 acres of land, for sale at 30 cents (Is. 3d. stg.) per acre;
The Valley of the Ottawa —The number of acres surveyed and divided
into farm lots actually to be disposed of in this district is 1,358,500
acres, the price of which is 30 cents per acre ; The Eastern Townships
—ln this rich grazing district there are 922,300 acres of wild land,
which the Government is prepared to sell at a moderate rate. The
Government lands in this section sell at from 50 to 60 cents (2s. Id.
to 2s. 6d, stg.) per acre. The Eastern Townships present more than
ordinary attractions to the agriculturist and capitalist from Great
Britain. The advantages offered for manufacturing by the province of
Quebec are very great. The small manufacturers of Europe, who are
unable to cope with the large capitalists, would find in Quebec immense
advantages. The principal articles manufactured in the province are
cloth, linen, furniture, leather, sawn timber, flax, iron and hardware,
paper, chemicals, soap, boots and shoes, cotton and woollen goods, &c.,
and all descriptions of agricultural implements. The richest and most
varied ores are found. Gold in the district of Beauce and elsewhere,
copper in the Eastern Townships, and iron nearly everywhere. Lead,
silver, platinum, zinc, &c., are found abundantly also. Mining, how-
ever, in this province is only in its infancy. The exports from the
mines amounted in 1876 to 365,546 dols. The total exports of pro-
duce of the mines for that year in the whole Dominion were 3,731,827
dols. The fisheries are a great boon to the settlers along the rich lands
girding the coast, and beginning to be a very large source of trade.
The total yield of the fisheries in Quebec in 1876, according to the
report of the Department of Fisheries, 2,097,677 dols. Here also all
home advantages in the way of education, religion, and commercial
facilities are afforded.
Hew Brunswick is about two-thirds the size of England. It is 210
miles in length, and 180 miles in breadth, and has a coast-line of
about 500 miles, and is intersected on all hands with large navigable
rivers. It is divided into fourteen counties. Similar climatic indica-
tions are observable as in Ontario, and it is said that the way in which
all root crops thrive is remarkable. Fruits of all kinds are plentiful,
as well as corn; one statistician averring that Hew Brunswick was
capable of producing supplies for 5,000,000 or 6,000,000 people.
Large blocks of choice farming land have lately been laid off by order
of the Government, from which free grants of 100 acres can be


obtained by every bead of a family containing children under 18
years of age.
Situated on the sea, with forests of superior ship timber, New
Brunswick has long been celebrated as a shipbuilding country, and
with furnishing vessels remarkable for their model, strength, and
durability. With a population in 1871 of 285,594 souls she had, in
1876, on the registry books of the Dominion, at December 31st,
1,154 vessels, having an aggregate of 324,513 tons. The manufac-
turing interest of the province has greatly increased during the past
few years. Establishments of woollen and cotton goods, boots and
shoes, leather, lumber, furniture, carriages, doors, sashes, stoves, paper,
soap, agricultural implements, stoves, nails, steam-engines, locomo-
tives, &c., are in successful operation, and, yearly multiplying, giving
employment, directly and indirectly, to thousands.
Nova Scotia has an area of about 300 miles in length by 80 to 100
in width. It has a population of 387,000 persons; and its acreage is
13,000,000, one-fifth portion consisting of lakes and small rivers.
About 5,000,000 acres of land are fitted for tillage, the remainder
being rocky and barren, and presents to a stranger a very rugged and
sterile appearance. But the interior of the country is beautifully
fertile, and in many respects its productions are superior to those of
Great Britain. The climatic extremes, as mentioned in other provinces,
are not experienced here, which is attributed to the fact of its being
surrounded by the sea, and further by its protective elements in the
shape of mountains and hills.
All the small fruits, such as currants, gooseberries, strawberries,
raspberries, blackberries, blueberries, huckleberries, cranberries, &c.,
are very abundant, both in a wild state and cultivated. The markets
of Halifax and the small towns are well supplied with them in their
season. The wild strawberries, though small, are remarkably rich and
high flavoured, indeed they are far more delicious than any of the
cultivated sorts. The cultivation of this fruit seems to increase the
size at the expense of the flavour. The grain and root crops are also
excellent; the average production in the western counties is, as nearly
as can be estimated, as follows :
Wheat, per acre , . . , . 18 bushels
Rye ~ . . . . . 21 ~
Barley ~ . . . . . 35 ~
Oats ~ . . . . . 34 ~
Buckwheat,, . . . . . 33 ~
Indian Corn (Maize) . . . . 42 ~
Turnips . . ... 420 ~
Potatoes . . ... 250 ~
Mangold Wurzel . . ... 500 ~
Beans . • . . . 22 ~
Hay . ... 2 tons
Dairy farming is also carried on with success in many counties, and
is susceptible of great extension. As a sheep-raising county there is,
perhaps, no better locality in America, notwithstanding which there is
not a sheep farm in the province, at least such were recent reports.


The Fisheries are an important interest. In 1876, the number of
vessels employed was 653, number of boats 9,585, and number of
men 24,142. The quantity of codfish caught was 509,968 cwt.,
valued at 2,549,840 dollars; of mackerel, 70,964 barrels, valued at
709,640 dollars; of haddock, 13,679,214 lbs., valued at 820,752
dollars; of herrings, 164,142 barrels, valued at 660,570 dollars; of
lobsters, 3,348,720 cans, valued at 602,308 dollars. Of fish oils, the
quantity obtained was 345,674 gallons, of a value of 224,688 dollars.
The total value of the Fisheries of this province for 1876 was
6,029,050 dollars.
The quantity of land at the disposal of the Government is limited,
the price 44 dollars per 100 acres of Crown land —free grants being,
however, given to hand fide settlers. The price of ordinary day
labour is from 3s. 9d. to ss. sterling. Farm labourers, during spring
time and harvest, earn even larger wages, and board besides. The
cost of provisions is much lower than in England, the price of flour
varying from £1 to £1 10s. sterling per barrel; beef, mutton, veal
from 6 to 10 cents, per lb.
Prince Edward Island. —The land in this rich and prosperous
province is nearly all taken up and under cultivation. It is
situated on the south side of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, between
New Brunswick and Cape Breton. Its extent from east to west is
130 miles, and from north to south 34 miles, with an area of 2,134
square miles.
The coast is indented by numerous bays, two of which nearly
divide the island into three parts, and the harbours are numerous.
The surface is gently undulating, presenting a charming aspect of hill
and dale, and is well watered with numerous springs and rivers. The
soil is remarkably fertile, and it has more land under cultivation in
proportion to its size than any of the other provinces. All kinds of
grain, fruit, and vegetables do well. Large deposits of what is called
“mussel mud ” are found in the beds of all the rivers, some of them
from 10 to 30 feet deep, and are used as fertilizers giving very large
crops of hay and clover. Potatoes, oats, and barley have been the
principal staples for export; horses also have been raised in numbers,
and are much sought after by dealers from the Northern New England
States. The sheep are fine, and are also sought for by New England
buyers. Cattle breeding has not yet received much attention, though
the pasturage is remarkably good, and both hay and root crops yield
very large returns. It is believed that the island affords favourable
facilities for the breeding and fattening of cattle for export to the
United Kingdom. The fisheries are among the best in the Gulf, and
give employment to a large number of men. Shipbuilding is also one
of the principal industries. The climate is temperate and healthy,
and fogs do not prevail to the same extent as on the coasts of Nova
Scotia. Farms in good cultivation, with buildings and improvements,
can be obtained for about 20 dollars an acre. A submarine telegraph
connects the island with New Brunswick. There is one railroad on


the island 198| miles long. It is under the control of the Dominion
Government. Steamers ply constantly between the ports on the
islands and the seaports of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and New
England States. The chief drawback is that during a part of the
winter communication is interrupted with the main shore owing to
ice blockades.
Manitoba covers an area of 2,750,000 square miles in extent, and
is generally known as the North-West Territories of British America.
The new province of Manitoba contains about 9,000,000 acres of
land The soil, which is mostly prairie, and covered with grass, is a
deep alluvial deposit of unsurpassed richness. It produces beautiful
crops of cereals, grasses, roots, and vegetables. So rich and inex-
haustible is the soil, that wheat is said to have been cropped off the
same place for 50 years without manure, and without showing signs
of exhaustion. It is especially a wheat-growing soil.
Oats, barley, rye, potatoes, &c., grow five degrees beyond wheat in
the Mackenzie River Valley to the Arctic Circle. Barley is a favourite
alternate crop for wheat in Manitoba, and yields very large returns,
with a weight per bushel of from 50 to 55 pounds. Oats also thrive
well.
It has not yet been demonstrated by experiment whether fruit-trees,
such as apples, will flourish on the open prairie. But it appears from
experience in Minnesota that they will in connection with shelter and
forest tree planting. There is, however, no doubt that the hardier
kinds of apples will do well in Manitoba. This has been sufficiently
established.
Although flax and hemp succeed well in Manitoba, the want of
markets has prevented their culture, except to a limited extent. Bees
do well here, as in similar northern climates, the clear skies and rich
flora being favourable for them. They live better through the long,
cold, dry winters, and consume less honey than in the milder and
more humid winters of more southern latitudes. The grasses grow
rich and luxuriant for twelve hundred miles north of the southern
boundary of Manitoba, and far down the Mackenzie River towards
the Arctic Ocean immense herds of buffalo feed upon these plains as
their chosen pastures. The significance of this fact is a proof of the
vast extent of country in the north-west suitable for pastures.
The quality of the beef and mutton raised upon these northern
grasses has been pronounced of superior excellence. Among the
peculiar advantages of Manitoba for stock raising and wool growing
the most prominent are —Ist. The richness and luxuriance of the
native grasses. The grass is mainly cut on the swamps and meadows,
which chequer the prairies, or fringe the streams and lakes. 2nd.
The great extent of unoccupied land, affording for many years to
come a wide range of free pasturage. 3rd. The remarkable dryness
and healthfulness of the winter. Wool grows heavier, and mutton,
beef, and pork are sweeter and more juicy. It is nearly forty years
since the introduction of sheep into Red River, and no case of any


disease attacking them has ever been known or heard of. Well-fed
ewes produce fleeces from 2to 3J pounds. Wethers produce fleeces
from 6 to 8 pounds, the wool being of a good quality.
It has been stated that the climate of Manitoba and the north-west
is pleasant and healthy. It may be added that the dryness of the air,
the character of the soil, which retains no stagnant pools to send forth
poisonous exhalations, and the almost total absence of fog or mist,
the brilliancy of its sunlight, the pleasing succession of its seasons,
all conspire to make Manitoba a climate of unrivalled salubrity, and
the future home of a healthy, prosperous people, strong in physical,
intellectual, and moral capabilities. Fevers and consumptions are
almost unknown, and diseases of an epidemical character have never
been known to prevail.
THE UNITED STATES.
Whilst other colonies herein alluded to possess far greater attractions
to the emigrant than the United States, and this by reason of there
being a greater scope for industries, and richer soil and climate for
agricultural produce contained in them, some remarks concerning the
vast Republic to which in years past and even at the present thou-
sands of adventurous eyes have and do turn, may not be uninteresting.
To commence with New York City, it has at present a population con-
siderably over a million, the neighbouring. districts of Brooklyn and
New Jersey probably adding some 600,000 to this number. Sufficient
is known of the magnitude of its trading operations to render
recapitulation unnecessary ; but with regard to the lives of the labour-
ing classes something may be said. Scarcely any of this class rent
entire houses, but live chiefly in tenements at rents varying from 20
to 30 dollars monthly. Indeed the houses resemble the industrial
dwellings of our own central city. The average rate of wages
earned by a carpenter is 3 to 3£ dollars per day of eight hours;
cabinet-makers (of whom the great majority are Germans', earn
to 3| dollars daily; plasterers, 4 to 4£ dollars per day; brick-
layers and stonemasons, 4to dollars per day. Another large
branch of industry is that of pianoforte making, but in this also a
large proportion of Germans are employed. Workers in the iron
trades seem from recent reports to be in excess of the demand, and
painters, and plasterers, and stonemasons are subject to similar incon-
veniences in wintry weather as in the home country. Labourers,
whose duty consists chiefly in attending the masons, and in the blast-
ing operations so necessary in the city, earn 2£ dollars per day, the
majority being Irishmen. Wages generally are not so high in the
States as they were some eight or ten years since, whilst provisions,
as far as regards bread and meat, are about the same as in England.
Fruit is very cheap and plentiful. Elmira is said to be one of the
prettiest spots in Southern New York. It has a population of rather


over 20,000, whose chief occupations are in the iron and hoot
manufactories. At the ironworks the puddlers get 3 dollars per day;
puddle-rollers, 3 dollars 25 cents; roughers, 2 dollars 60 cents;
catchers, 2 dollars 30 cents; huggy hoys, 1 dollar 50 cents. In the
rail mills skilled labour ranged from 5 dollars to 2 dollars 80 cents;
unskilled, 1 dollar 50 cents and under; whilst at the furnaces wages
ranged from 1 dollar 80 cents to 2 dollars 25 Cents. Buffalo is
on the west of the State, and contains about 160,000 population.
The climate is very healthy. Unlike the capital city, the inhabitants
live in separate houses, these being in many instances the occupiers’
own property in consequence of facilities of purchase being given
them. Boston is the chief town in Massachusetts, having a popula-
tion of some 350,000. In it are some splendid public buildings, and
the staple trade appears to be fish. New Bedford also, which stands a
short distance from Boston, is largely engaged in the fishing trade. At
Waltham, the chief occupation seems to be watchmaking. Webster,
also a small township of M assachusetts, with a population of between
8.000 and 9,000, is chiefly engaged in the manufacture of broadcloth,
and cigar making. Lowell, another district, contains some 50,000
inhabitants, and does extensive business in cotton, woollen, and hosiery
goods, employing about 16,000 hands. Fall River is a town which
ranks high in the manufacture of cotton, and is populated by about
50.000 persons. There are here nearly fifty mills and 30,000
looms. In Pennsylvania, Lancaster stands prominently forward, and
although its population is not far in excess of 20,000, it is rich in
agricultural products. Iron and coal mines and steel manufactures
are the principal trades. The State of Michigan is famous for its pine
forests, and its iron and copper mines are extensive. The inhabitants
of Ann Arbor, of whom there are some 12,000, are chiefly occupied in
its agricultural implement works and flour mills. Mount Morris is
strictly an agricultural district, the farms averaging about 200 acres
each, the majority of them doing their own tillage. Cincinnati, which
is the principal city of Ohio, is stated to be a flourishing town, and
wages are better and food more reasonable than in many other places.
Auburn, with its population of 11,000, has an extensive boot manu-
facturing trade. In the cotton mills of Lewiston there are about
250.000 spindles and 50,000 looms in daily use. Wages, provisions,
and rent are not spoken of as very favourable. Of the wages in the
mills, pickers and strippers get 1| dollars per day, girls 61 dollars
per week. For warp spinning on ring frames, with young class of
help, 92 cents per day; filling mule-spinning, 2 dollars per day;
spooling, warping, and dressing department, with English slashers,
females, 1 dollar 8 cents per day; males, 1 dollar 50 cents per day;
weavers, 1 dollar 20 cents per day. In some of the fancy-coloured
work girls earn 2to 2£ dollars per day; but this is very hard work,
and few can stand it. Board in the corporation houses costs 2 dollars
per week ; but in addition to this the companies pay half a dollar per
week, which is, in fact, an increase of wage. Mechanics employed on
the machinery in the mill get 2£ dollars per day. Eents for work-


people living in their own homes average for four rooms 150 dollars per
year. Provisions.—Good poultry, 20 cents per pound ; inferior, 10
cents. Sirloin steaks sell at from 25 to 28 cents. One rump steak sells
25 cents; round steak, 18 to 22 cents. The back half of a fore
quarter sells from 18 to 22 cents per pound. The shin is worth
only 4 cents per pound. What is termed the “ chuck ” averages
from Bto 10 cents per pound. Mutton is plenty at 9 to 10 cents
per pound. Good Maine hogs sell at 10 to 11 cents. Fresh
hams sell at 12 to 12£ cents; pork steak, 10 cents; spare-rib, 15 to
16 cents. Potatoes average 50 cents per bushel. Onions sell at 1
dollar 25 cents per bushel. Turnips, beets, carrots, and ordinary
squash sell at 1 cent per pound; extra squash, l£ to 2 cents.
Sweet potatoes sell at 4 cents. Beans are 3 dollars per bushel; butter,
34 cents per pound ; cheese 15 cents per pound; eggs, 35 cents per
dozen. In Boston cheese and butter exceed these prices. Dexter is a
great woollen manufacturing district, the wages in which do not average
more than 1 dollar 70 cents per day for males, and females up to 1£
dollar per day. Board costs about 2 dollars 30 cents weekly. In
this neighbourhood several slate quarries exist. Granite is abundantly
found at Rockland , which is also situate in the state of Maine, and
the stone-cutters command a good wage. Rent and provisions is
cheaper in Maine than in the capital city. The chief industries of
the former place are lumber and tanneries. Other unimportant
places, such as St. Andrew's, Calais, St. George, Red Beech, are rich
in stone and timber; whilst Houlton, the capital of the Aroostook
county, which has a population of 5,000, is famous for its agricultural
resources. The price of the land varies from 2to 10 dollars per acre.
The climate is healthy, and is favourable to the growing of wheat,
oats, buckwheat, hay, and potatoes. High wages are paid to the
agriculturists in about three months of the year only.
For some twenty or thirty years Maine has had a special land law,
by Avhich any settler, whether or not a citizen of the United States of
America, has the right to select any lot of State land yet unappro-
priated, and to pay for it in labour. The State is divided into
squares, each square containing six miles. These squares are again
subdivided into lots, each containing 160 acres, or about half a mile
square. On selecting a lot the selector gives his promissory notes for
80 dollars, payable to the State, being at the rate of half a dollar per
acre for the land. These notes are payable over three years, one-third
each year; but are not payable in mttney. They are to be paid in
labour of road-making (round the allotments selected) at the rate of
two dollars per day; that is, forty days’ labour at road-making during
three years, or not quite a fortnight in each year, will pay for the
land. In addition to this, the settler must bind himself to clear and
cultivate within four years not less than fifteen acres of the land he
has thus acquired. When the notes are given by the settler to the
land agent, the latter gives to the intending settler an authority to
reside on the land, and to appropriate the crops. It is estimated that
the first crop covers the cost of clearing, which, if labour were hired


to effect the clearing, would cost about five dollars per acre. The
land gives 114 bushels of oats per acre, 40 bushels of wheat, and 40
bushels of buckwheat.
Settlers unused to lumbering are recommended, instead of taking
State lands, which are necessarily all bush lands, to purchase land
already cleared and improved. As to climate, it is said that in winter
the thermometer sometimes gets to twenty degrees below zero, and
that many of the houses are banked around to keep out the cold. In
the state of Pennsylvania, Lancaster stands prominent as a rich
agricultural district. It contains a population of over 20,000. Wheat
and tobacco are the chief products ; but there are some tolerably rich
mines. It is not, however, spoken of as possessing any great in-
ducements to the emigrant. Schuylkill and Luzerne are large coal-
producing counties, and anthracite coal is largely in excess of the
bituminous.
In 1840 the Schuylkill region produced 495,596 tons of coal; in
1850, 1,840,620 tons; in 1860, 3,749,532 tons; in 1870, 4,851,855
tons; in 1874, 6,500,000 tons; in 1870 the Wyoming region, from
198 squares miles of coal, produced 7,825,128 tons of coal, and this
had increased 18 per cent, in 1874. The coal area of Pennsylvania
is, for anthracite about 470 square miles, for bituminous 12,656 square
miles. Michigan is a large coal, iron, and copper producing State, and
has a population of about 1,600,000, its principal industries being
connected with timber. Chicago, too, largely partakes of the same in-
dustry ; whilst in Rock Island employment is given in the agricultural
implement manufacture. La Salle, in Illinois, is described as a rich
coal district, and is rapidly developing. It also possesses zinc, glass,
and cement works. In Wisconsin, Milwaukee has a population of
considerably over 100,000, and does a flourishing iron trade. The
wages of carpenters are from two and a half to three dollars per day,
masons three and a half to four and a half dollars per day; painters,
plumbers, and tinners two and a half to three dollars per day;
builders’ labourers and unskilled labourers generally, one and a half to
two dollars per day. Whitefish Bay derives its name probably from
the extensive trade done in that particular kind of edible; whilst
Fond de Lac supports its 18,000 or 20,000 of population by its
timber. Another place bearing the euphonious name of Oshkosh, and
which has a population of 20,000, also carries on an extensive lumber
trade. Most men till their own farms. Farm labourers are employed
in the harvest season at from 20 to 30 dollars per month with board.
In the winter these men go north, and work in the pineries. Wages
for this class vary from 18 dollars to 35 dollars, with food and camp
accommodation. The farmers mostly raise wheat. There are plenty of
good farms of 160 acres for sale, with good frame-house, storey and a
half high, and barn 100 feet by 40, for from 40 to 50 dollars per
acre. Hops are chiefly raised for home consumption, and Indian corn
for feeding the hogs. The lumber trade of the State has, it is said, a
long future before it. Despite the reckless clearing of the forest lands
by fire and axe, there are enormous tracts of yellow pine quite un-


touched, and there are many scores of thousands of acres of white
pine yet to he felled. In the state of Indiana large farming operations
are conducted, the labourers averaging 20 dollars per month, with
board. Indian corn, wheat, oats, and potatoes are plentifully raised,
and land ranges in price from 40 to 100 dollars per acre. The seasons
are moderate, and the health generally good. Kansas produces much
of the beef which arrives on our shores; and here and at Nebraska
the land is very fertile, and cattle and corn are profuse. The price of
land varies from 2 to 10 dollars per acre, but it can be purchased at
as low a figure as 5 dollars. lowa, Minesota, Illinois, Wisconsin,
and Northern Indiana are said to be amongst the best wheat-producing
districts, and there is every opportunity for considerable extension.
According to the reports of a recently held conference in London
there still appears to be opportunity for the speculative agriculturist
in the States, more especially in those of Manitoba and Kansas; but
one piece of advice which seemed to prevail throughout, and which
emanated from practical men, was, “ Don’t go without capital. There
are hardships in the squatter’s life which are not thought of by the
English-bred farmer.” The conference, it may be stated, applied more
particularly to the far west of America, and the promoters laid down
as their objects—the purchase, improvement, and cultivation of the
cheap lands of the Western States; engaging in stock-raising, wool-
growing, &c.; to provide farmers and others with improved freehold
farms upon easy terms by partial payments; to make loans upon
security of improved freehold farms; to aid and promote emigration
and settlement upon the company’s lands; to aid and prepare young
men as cadets for stock-raising and agricultural operations. In Kansas
alone there were stated to be 42,000,000 acres still in the natural
state, and that the whole country was covered with the richest wild
grasses, from the lowest to the highest hill.
Sir John Bennett, who was chairman of the meeting at the Cannon
Street Hotel early in September, said: The subject of emigration, he
considered, was of the greatest importance at the present time. The
English farmers were losing money, and, as one of the largest food
importers in the world had told him, in England agriculture was
wiped out. It was to America they would have to look for their food
supplies in the future. He was at Thames Haven a few days since,
and he had seen a big steamer come in, with her hold filled with wheat
and maize, and with beasts on the deck, and in forty-eight hours that
steamer discharged her cargo and was off again. It was impossible for
them to stand against such competition. Last month as many as
60,000 persons emigrated, and that rate of emigration would go on.
He had been a farmer; he knew a little about farming, and he knew
that if he had had to live on the profits of his farm (if he had not had
a farm in Cheapside), he would have had to go. The labourers would
soon shake the dust off their feet and be off, and the farmers would
have to follow. A farmer this year could get £7 an acre for his
wheat, and that would not pay rent, the exorbitant taxation, and the
paltry wages of the agricultural labourer —wages which no man ought


to take, but which were quite as much as the farmer could afford to
give. The landlords did not know what to do with the farms which
were being thrown on their hands; and the Commissioners wdio had
been sent out by the Government to inquire had returned with a
report which told us of the unbounded power of production of the
Western States.
Quoting from the report in the Christian World, another speaker, a
late senator in the States, remarked that “he had lived in Kansas
six years; he had known it for five-and-twenty. He had land there
he had bought for a dollar and a half an acre, which now he- would
not take seventy-five dollars an acre for. He was connected with a
company that had settled many farmers in America, and they were all
prospering. From enquiries he had recently made he had found that
butter could be sent from Kansas to Liverpool for two cents a pound,
and that would give a fine profit to the farmer. England was the head
of the manufacturing world, and we required cheap food if we would
retain our position; and in order to do that we must have cheap land,
and in Kansas they had that. He had known farmers who had gone
out with a couple of hundred pounds, who in five years had farms
worth from two to three thousand pounds. He did not think it was
advisable to take land that was to be had for nothing, as squatting
entailed much hardship. It would be much better for a man, if he
had a little money, to buy a farm; and if he worked hard, and did
not drink, and was not unfortunate, he would be sure to succeed, as
nine-tenths of the settlers in Kansas had done.”
Therefore it appears there are yet bright prospects under the “stars
and stripes,” and if all is correctly stated, the promoters of the scheme
have my best sympathies.
THE STATE OF TEXAS
Contains 175,000,000 acres, and has a population of about a million.
Stock-raising has been the favourite occupation of Texas settlers,
and its vast and fertile prarie lands afford facilities for breeding
and raising large quantities of cattle with comparatively little
care and attention. The climate is good, as the sea breeze is
an alleviation of the heat in summer. Kofth Texas is especially
adapted to the growth of wheat—from Dallas north to the Eed
River, or east towards Jefferson, south to Fairfield, and west to
the river Brazos. The low river bottoms in Texas; although fertile,
must not be allowed to tempt English settlers, as they are extremely
unhealthy; and it is said that in the northern parts of Texas un-
acclimatized persons suffer considerably from chills and fevers. In
many cases such diseases arise from inattention on the part of the new
settler to diet, clothing, and the state of indigestion. Lands in Texas are
very cheap indeed, and is held under a special land law, differing from
the other States in the union. While there are many large tracts of


good land on which such a co-operative village might easily he founded,
it should he remembered that these would he far removed from civili-
zation, and that produce would he realizable with difficulty, in con-
sequence of the cost of transportation. There is a large German
population in Texas, and a considerable negro element. Colorado is a
territory highly recommended for those who have capital. Colorado
has Wyoming territory on its north, Kansas on its east, Utah (or
Mormonland) on its west, and Kew Mexico on its south. It has an
area of 67,723,520 acres, and a population which, at the census of
1870, was only 39,864, and although it has much increased in popula-
tion since that date —amounting in June, 1874, to 105,118 —is still
very thinly peopled. Its surface has been divided into plains, parks,
and mountains. In the last are some valuable mining districts of coal
and iron, as well as the much-talked-of gold-mining region. The coal
district of Colorado embraces a district so vast that, with the coal-beds
of Wyoming, the coal basin includes at least 5,000 square miles. For
emigrants without means, and who have to live by hand labour,
Colorado is as yet too thinly settled to afford tempting enployment;
hut when the vast industries of this part of the country are developed
in the future, it has all the facilities for maintaining a very large
population. The soil of the plains in Colorado is highly praised.
Stock-raising in Colorado, as in Texas, is found to be a most profitable
speculation.
With reference to an allegation recently made as to the number of
emigrants to the Uuited States being largely over-estimated, a writer
in one of the morning papers says : “There is a considerable immigra-
tion from Canada to the United States, particularly to the warmer
regions of Texas and the south-west, admits of no question. Texas
has increased more than ninety per cent, in the last ten years, and in
this remarkable increase settlers from Canada and the British Islands
figure largely. Those of us who have experienced the long winters of
Canada and the northern American States, will he at no loss for
reasons for this rapid increase in population of a State where labour
in the open air can he comfortably performed on every day of the
year,”


PRACTICAL TESTIMONY.
The following address was delivered at the Homerton Evangelical
Hall, on the occasion of the Conference described in the preface, by
Mr. Lambert, a thoroughly practical and experienced man; many of
his remarks indeed applying to other countries than that to which he
specially refers :
“ The subject before us appears to me to involve three or four im-
portant considerations.
“ First, the necessity for emigration. There can be very little doubt
that this England of ours (that we are taught to think so much of)
is growing too small for its inhabitants; or rather, the inhabitants are
getting too many for the country. This fact is growing more and
more apparent every day. Ho matter to what branch of industry we
direct our attention w r e see the same thing—the supply is enormously
beyond the demand. Hot only in the operative spheres of simple
labour, where little more than physical strength is required, or in the
field of skilled labour, where years of manipulative and some mental
training is required to attain proficiency, hut in the higher branches of
industry, where an advanced standard of mental culture is requisite,
the same thing is prominently conspicuous—the supply is far in excess
of the demand; the harvest is much too small for the reapers. How
if, instead of being a nation of presumably reasonable men and
women, we were a community of ants, or a hive of bees, or a herd of
cattle, we should need no one to tell us what it was our business and
our duty to do; a motive power which is both higher and lower than
human reason—instinct—would direct the ants to found a fresh
colony, the bees to swarm to another hive, and the cattle to roam in
search of fresh fields and pastures new. But being men, endowed
with reason and will to direct and govern our actions, hut more
especially being Englishmen, taught from our cradles to regard the
land of our birth as the greatest country in the world, the gem of the
ocean, with a government sublime in its perfection, laws almost divine,
a noble aristocracy, before which the ancient patricians of Greece and
Rome must hide their diminished heads, and all the rest of the
intolerable, drivelling bosh that is instilled into us from the cradle to
the grave, we prefer to stay and starve, to work all our lives and die
in the workhouse, to live in cellars and garrets, to crowd together in
hack streets till the stench of our overcrowded humanity offends the
nostrils of our rich men who fatten on our poverty, and our dwellings


are demolished to make room for our masters, while we must go
farther afield. We are told that England is the richest country in the
world, and believe it to he an undoubted fact; hut the evil is that its
wealth is too unequally divided. There are, on the one hand, too
many making colossal fortunes, and, on the other hand, far too many
living from hand to mouth, simply living in the present, without the
ability to make a start towards a more hopeful state of existence.
Writers in the papers and in works on social and political economy
are fond of talking of the high state of w'ages at the present time,
and blaming the improvidence of working men; and there is no doubt
that wages are higher nominally than they were, say twenty years ago.
But these people too often overlook the fact that the money of the
present day ig practically far less valuable than it was then. I think
I should be quite within the mark in saying that the sovereign of the
present day is only worth, so far as its purchasing power is concerned,
two-thirds of the value it possessed twenty years ago; and the rela-
tions of capital and labour have suffered so considerable a change, and
there are so many competitors in the labour market, that constant
employment is a comparatively rare circumstance in the condition of
working men. Now there are two remedies for the present unpleasant
state of affairs : one is co-operation and the other is emigration. Both
are powerful, and valuable, and effective means of ameliorating the
present condition of things. But emigration has this advantage, that
it benefits not only those who take advantage of it, but also those who
cannot or will not do so; for it is a logical certainty that each emigrant
who leaves this country to seek independence and comfort in a newer
and wider field for his energy, makes it by so much the better and
more tolerable for those he leaves behind, by lessenning the over-
stocked supply in the labour market.
“ ‘ True patriots they ; for be it understood,
They leave their country for their country’s good.’
Now as to the legitimate aim and end of emigration. This is a point
upon which a great many intending emigrants make a great mistake.
They think, ‘ We will go to America, or the Cape, or Australia, and
in a few years we shall make our fortunes, and come back to Old
England, and live in independence for the rest of our lives.’ Now
depend upon it such a notion is the most fatal mistake that can be
made. It prevents a man from settling down to steady persevering
labour, and keeps him unsettled and unsatisfied. He perhaps makes
a start in something, but is too impatient to give it a lair trial. It
may produce a tolerable income, but that does not satisfy him; he
wants something more rapid, and the result in most cases is, that he
wastes more time in trying speculative and uncertain means of getting
money than would really lay the foundation of, if not a fortune, a
comfortable independence. My conviction is that no man, at any rate
no poor man, should become an emigrant unless he is prepared alto-
gether to give up the land of his birth, and thoroughly and entirely
transfer his heart and interests to the land of his adoption, to make


it his home and the home of his family. Before he chooses to cast
his lot in a new country let him thoroughly satisfy himself that he
has done with the old, and do his very best to work in harmony with
his new surroundings. It is doing a gross injustice to any country to
acquire wealth in it and take it away to spend it. Persons who so
act are not emigrants in the legitimate sense of the word; they are
simply adventurers, who take all and give nothing, and benefit no one
but themselves. Such men are not wanted in any new country.
What I take to be the legitimate aim and end of emigration is, to
make an honest independence, to fully and freely cast all one’s
energies into the land of our choice, and, if success crown the effort,
to remain in the country which has blest the enterprise, and let it reap
whatever benefit may accrue from our success; for no principle of
political economy is more true than that the wealth of the individual
is part of the national wealth, and the more equally that wealth is
distributed, the more really happy and prosperous will the nation he.
I think there is something very noble in a man casting off and rising
above the trammels of caste, and an over-refined civilization, and
hewing out for himself a home from the crude materials of nature,
bending circumstances to his will, and becoming the head and founder
of a family. Who knows but in the far-off future his descendants may
become famous in the senate, the bar, the pulpit, or the press, and the
place whereon he has chosen to erect his roof-tree become hallowed
ground, like the spot where, two hundred years ago, the Pilgrim
Fathers planted the banner of freedom, social, political, and religious,
on the shores of New England ! Such a result cannot possibly accrue
in most cases; but what may reasonably be expected is, that in a
country—and there is such—where the freehold value of land is less
than one-fourth of its rental value in England, any man with patience,
and perseverance, and energy, may make for himself and those dear
to him a home and independence, and rest from his labours at last in
the bosom of his family, far removed from the sound of the workhouse
bell or the sight of the pauper’s dress. Why, in the colonies of
Australia alone there are millions and millions of acres of land of
wonderful fertility, blessed by a climate of marvellous salubrity, where
the cries of the wild denizens of the forest wake no echoes but their
own, where the foot of man has never trod, where there is any quan-
tity of room for expansion, which the wildest stretch of the human
imagination, ranging over thousands of years, can scarcely conceive
over-populated; while here in England, if all its inhabitants were
placed at equidistance from each other, only twenty-five yards would
intervene between each individual. Do not, however, imagine that I
mean to infer that agriculture is the only field for a man’s exertions
in a new country. It is natural in thinking and speaking of countries
where land is superabundant and cheap to consider that first, and I
am supported by some eminent political economists in thinking that a
nation largely engaged in agriculture possesses within itself the most
reliable conditions of prosperity. But all men cannot be farmers, and
need not. There is in all new countries a good demand for most of


the branches of skilled labour, as well as for simple manual labour,
and at remunerative wages. I have myself earned 30s. a day, as a
journeyman carpenter, for eight hours’ work. That was many years
ago ; but now that tilings are more settled down, the average wages
for skilled mechanics is 10s. per day. Another important point to
be considered is the sort of persons suitable for emigrants. I might
say, briefly enough, men of energy; and that would be the truth, but
not all the truth. The man who wishes to succeed as an emigrant
must possess all the qualifications which distinguish good, earnest men
in this or any other country, but most particularly does he require
energy and sobriety ; for drink, which is the curse of England, is also
the curse of its colonies; and unless a man has some safeguard in a
temperance pledge, or what is infinitely better, in his own inherent
self-respect and strength of will and purpose, all the benefit of living
in a country where competition is not excessive, where taxes are not
severe, and where the prejudices of caste are at a minimum, will be
of no avail. I think there are no more suitable persons for emigrants
than young men, and if they are married so much the better. In a
country where all the necessaries of life are abundant and cheap, the
anxiety which here attends increase of family need have no existence.
There will be no reason to dread the coming of each little stranger;
but a parent may realize that children are blessings, and he who has
most has wealth for his labour and riches to boast. Most certainly do
I consider it an advantage to a man choosing a new country for his
home to have a wife. It settles him, in the best sense of the word;
it steadies him, gives an incentive to his labour that is not altogether
selfish ; it keeps him from becoming a rolling stone gathering no moss,
and supplies him with that sacred love and instinct of home which
has ever inspired, in nations as in individuals, the most noble and
heroic actions. Do you think that if America had been a colony of
bachelors it would ever have fought and gained its independence]
Not it. When the impositions of the old country became too oppres-
sive they would have said, ‘ Well, this country is getting too warm for
us; we will go somewhere else.’ But they had their families, and
wives, and homes to consider; and they said, ‘ This is our home and
country.’ And they entered upon that gallant, and heroic, and bloody
struggle which ended in the Declaration of Independence, and made
America what it is now, a country to marvel and wonder at. And so
at some time or other may all our colonial possessions become. Even
now they are making their own history, gathering round them local
associations, rearing statesmen, poets, and artists, making their own
laws; and as they feel their strength there is not the slightest doubt
but they will shake off their allegiance to any laws or rulers but their
own, and become independent nations. But although I consider
young married men the best of emigrants, it by no means follows that
there is no chance for any one else. There is ample room and em-
ployment in our colonies for bachelors and spinsters, and indeed all who
are able and willing to work and adapt themselves to circumstances.
Perhaps one of the most valuable qualities in an emigrant is the


ability to adapt himself to circumstances, to step out of the accus-
tomed groove and seize upon any chance that offers; to become one’s
own baker, and butcher, and brewer, and tailor, and washerwoman;
to do anything and everything, and be ashamed of no honest labour.
And in this relation I may say that, so far as my own colonial
experience goes, the working man (in the colonies of Australia at any
rate) occupies a better position in society than he does in England.
He is not so much looked down upon, and in a certain sense Jack is
as good as his master. Many of the men who have made their mark
and become prominent in the country have sprung from the working
classes, and I think that fact has created a tendency to judge of men
more from their individual merit than from the class to which they
belong. Hot that I wish to infer that there are not class distinctions
there, as there are here; but they are not so many or so strict. Perhaps
one of the most important points for the intending emigrant to settle with
himself is the choice of a colony. And there are many to choose from.
From my own personal experience I can only speak of one —the island
of Australia; and without vaunting its claims over others, I may say that
I believe it offers very great inducements to the intending emigrant.
Its climate, on the whole, is temperate, considerably warmer in summer
than the English climate, and milder in winter, and is remarkably
healthy; more especially is it suitable for persons having a tendency
to any of the forms of consumption. I lived in one part of it for
two or three years where the nearest doctor was at a distance of
seventy miles, and indeed the only cases which I knew where a
doctor’s skill was required was in cases of accidents, chiefly mining
accidents, and those cases which necessarily attend the increase of
population; and I think, on the whole, we got on better without a
doctor than we should with one. The soil, too, is fertile, and assisted
by the climate, will grow almost anything. All the English fruits and
vegetables, and a great many others, will grow in abundance. Tea,
sugar, tobacco, cotton, and many other semi-tropical products can be
grown; not all in one part, but in various parts of the country. Its
mineral wealth, too, is great. Hot only gold, but copper, silver, mer-
cury, antimony, and —last, but by no means least—coal, are all found
in this vast island. Timber is abundant, and there are very liberal
land laws. In Hew South Wales especially the laws relating to the
purchase and occupation of the Crown lands are very favourable to
the would be freeholder. The chief drawback is the insufficient water
supply; but much has been and is being done to remedy this defect,
by the construction of dams for collecting and storing the surplus
water, sinking of wells, planting trees, &c.; and as the country gets
populated, and civilization advances, there is not the slightest doubt
but human ingenuity will supply the natural deficiency. And there
is one thing about Australia which to my mind speaks volumes in
itself. Ido not know whether such a thing has been called into
existence since, but when I was there, throughout the length and
breadth of that vast country, there was no such thing as a workhouse.”


NOTES.
The following item comes from Queensland with reference to the
railway accommodation there : “ Notification of an important change
in the railway policy of the Queensland Government has been made.
Until recently the Government have followed the plan in force in the
Australian Colonies generally of borrowing money for the construction
of lines. Now, the Melbourne Argus says, they have determined to
adopt the American land-grant system. During his recent visit to
London, Mr. Mcllwraith (the Premier) found that English capitalists
were willing, and even eager, to make Queensland railways on these
terms. Two syndicates were anxious to drive a bargain with him on
the spot. So impressed was he with what he saw and heard, that he
has determined now to stop the trunk lines at the earliest convenient
opportunity, and to arrange for their continuation by private com-
panies. He is quite determined not to go on with the present system
of building these railways at the Government expense, and if any of
them do not offer sufficient inducements to private enterprise, they
will have to remain in abeyance.
A report from South Australia on September 18th last says : “The
local farmers at Jamestown are trying the experiment of shipping
their grain direct instead of through a third party. A sugar company
has been started for the Northern Territory. It is to receive 10,000
acres on condition of 10s. being expended on every acre, and 250 tons
of sugar being produced within a given time.”
The Colonies iqf India of September 18, referring to trade in
Queensland, says resolution has been carried in Parliament to
give £5,000 as a bonus for the first 500 tons of marketable iron
manufactured from Queensland ores. A Freezing and Meat Export
Company has been formed, with a capital of £60,000, of which
£40,000 has already been subscribed.”
Reports from Canada up to the end of September say that the
exports during July were 10,007,179 dollars, as against 8,112,351 in
1879, and 6,635,083 in 1878. Additional accommodation for re-
porters at the sittings of the local Parliament was urgently required.
Small-pox had broken out violently among the Tetes de Routes
Indians on the Riviere-le-Desert Reserve. Medical assistance had been
sent to their superintendent, Mr. Logue. The Hon. M. Letellier de
St. Just was dangerously ill. The export of lumber from Ottowa to


Buenos Ayres had commenced, and was likely to develop. During the
month of August, 2,220 tons of ore were taken from the Forsyth iron
mine. This is the largest monthly out-put from any Canadian mine
as yet.
A cablegram had been received to the effect that a Joint-stock
Company had been formed in England for the purpose of purchasing
limits and controlling the lumber market. The Pembroke Standard
observes : “ This is the beginning of a gigantic scheme which will
throw a large amount of British capital into this country.”
With regard to the condition of Hew South Wales up to the end
of July last, the following figures will give some idea of the wonder-
ful plenty that exists in the country. At Orange, the centre of one
of the richest pastoral districts, the following are the advertised prices
of meat just now : Beef (fore-quarter), |d. per lb.; hind-quarter, Id.;
mutton, l|d., by the carcase. Let the hungry poor of London fancy-
such a profusion. Of course the cost of transit to Sydney and other
parts has to be added to these prices here; but even then meat is
procurable at almost a nominal rate. The Fresh Food and Ice Com-
pany, having their slaughtering establishment at Lithgow, on the
same line of rails, have a magnificent establishment in Sydney, and
are selling the most delicious meat possible at an average price of 3d.
per lb. for best beef, and 2|d. for mutton, retail; with a reduction for
large quantities. The fat on ribs of beef sold on Saturday was over
an inch in thickness, the flesh tender and succulent.
A new gold-field has been discovered, which bids fair to eclipse all
others in the colony, not only for its excellent yield, but for its
accessibility. The new “ rush,” called “ the Temora ” (after a Flew
Zealand place), is situated near Cootamundra, one of the most
recently-opened stations on the southern line of railway en route to
Melbourne. In February last a party of miners found payable gold at a
depth of sixty feet, and another party found some rich surface ground,
averaging 19 grains of gold to the dish. A stream of working bees of
every description migrated from every surrounding locality. Beef at
Bs. percwt., and retailed at 2d. a pound; the three-pound loaf, 6d. ;
tea, 25.; sugar, 5d.; potatoes, l£d. In this way are new settlements
formed.
Considerable deposits of tin have been discovered near Gladstone.
Advices from Perth, Western Australia, to July 30th, say the
House is determined to have a railway, which is absolutely necessary
for the development of the country. Members intend to cut down all
they possibly can on the estimates, to introduce a Stamp Bill, Probate
and Legacy Duty Bill, and to take such other steps as will enable
them both to pay off the deficit in the immediate future, and to carry
on the Eastern Pailway without any delay. The Government pro-
poses no legislation of any importance, but the House intends to
insist upon an Audit Act, in order that the country may be protected
against extravagance and financial mismanagement.
The latest reports from Ontario, in the Dominion of Canada, say
that trade with the West Indies has increased wonderfully of late. In


1878, only half-a-dozen vessels were employed in carrying sugar to
Montreal; last year they increased to forty-five : and so for this year
forty-two have arrived at the port of Montreal. At Picton, N.S., the
number of arrivals of vessels this year is more than two-thirds larger
than last year. A large and flourishing trade in flour is springing up
between Ontario and the maritime provinces.
A very rich vein of gold-bearing quartz has been, it is reported,
discovered in the wild region to the north of Fort William. The
quartz is said to be the richest ever discovered on the continent, and
there being splendid water-power in the neighbourhood, a crushing
mill will be erected at once.
The coal mining industry of Sydney, Cape Breton, is very brisk at
present.
The gold areas near Sheet Harbour, H.S., have been sold to
American capitalists for 60,000 dollars.


USEFUL INFORMATION.
The following miscellaneous, shipping arrangements, passengers’ rights,
cautions, &c., as supplied by the Colonial Office, will be useful to the
emigrant;
The choice of a colony having been decided on, the next considera-
tions for an emigrant who has to pay for his own passage are, the time
and port of departure, the shipping arrangements, and outfit.
Best time to emigrate to North America. —The best time to arrive
in North America is early in May, when the inland navigation is open,
and out-door operations are commencing. The emigrant will then be
able to take advantage of the spring and summer work, and to get
settled before the winter sets in. The average length of passage, as
before stated, is in steamers about 12 days, and in sailing vessels about
36 days.
Length of voyage to Australia. —The time of departure for the
Australasian colonies is not very material, but of course it is better to
arrive in the spring; that is, about October, than in the slack season.
Shipping. —The ships on the berth for the various colonies, with the
addresses of the brokers or owners, can be ascertained from the adver-
tising newspapers published in London, Liverpool, and at the ports
from whence passenger ships are usually despatched. But emigrants
applying to the Government Emigration Officer of the port from which
they propose to sail, will be informed of the ships about to leave, and
the general cost of passage, &c.
Contract Tickets. —In engaging their passages, emigrants should take
care to obtain in return for any money they may pay, either for
deposit or in full, the printed contract tickets prescribed by the
Passengers Act, 1855, signed by the owners, charterers, or masters of
the ships, or by some authorised person in their name or on their
behalf. The contract tickets should be carefully preserved as the best
evidence and means of enforcing the rights conferred on emigrants by
the Passenger Acts,
Passengers' Rights. —These rights are ; (1) a return of passage money


with compensation not exceeding £lO if a passage is not provided
according to the terms of the contract ticket; (2) subsistence money if
the vessel in which the passage is engaged is delayed beyond the day
after the one fixed in the contract ticket for embarkation ; (3) the
right, in case of wreck or damage to the ship, to he sent on to the
specified destination at the owner’s or charterers’ expense; (4) and
maintenance in the ship for 48 hours after arrival, unless the ship
quits the port in further prosecution of her voyage. The latter two
rights, however, belong only to emigrants who proceed in what is
called a “ passenger ship; ” that is, a vessel carrying more than 50
passengers in all, or more than one statute adult to every 33 tons of a
sailing ship, or more than one to every 20 tons of a steamer.
Contract Tickets to he produced on demand. —Although passengers
should not part with their contract tickets, they are bound under a
penalty not exceeding to produce them on the demand of any
emigration officer.
Joining the Ship. —Emigrants must hear in mind that if they are not
at the port of embarkation before 6 o’clock p.m. of the day named in
their contract tickets, and ready to pay the balance, if any, of their
passage money, they may forfeit their passage, and all claim on the
shipowners.
Outfit for North American Voyage. —The outfit for passages in
steamers to North America need be but little more than the ordinary
stock of clothing usually possessed by persons of the working class.
The additions recommended are some warm garments for outer wear,
flannel for under clothes, and good strong boots and shoes. Steerage
passengers are generally required to find their own bedding, and certain
articles called mess utensils, for their use during the voyage. There
is not room in the sleeping berths on board ship for feather beds and
bulky mattresses. Sufficient suitable bedding and mess utensils can
be bought at the ports of embarkation for about 255. per adult; but
persons who have a good stock of blankets of their own will find that
two or three large blankets folded to the size of their berths will make
them a more comfortable bed for a short voyage than the common
mattresses usually sold for the purpose. If feather beds are taken,
they should be packed in good casks, to be stowed away in the hold.
For Australian Voyage. —The outfit for the Australian voyage is
necessarily larger. The usual length of the voyage to the Australian
colonies is about three months, and to New Zealand a little longer;
and as, at whatever season of the year it may be made, passengers have
to encounter very hot and very cold weather, they should be prepared
for both.
As there are but few opportunities of washing at sea, the smallest
quantity of clothing for the Australian voyage which should be taken
is ; for each male over 12, six shirts, six pairs of stockings, two warm


flannel shirts, two pairs of new shoes or hoots, two complete suits of
strong exterior clothing, four towels, and 21bs. of best yellow soap;
and for each female over 12, six shifts, two flannel petticoats, six pairs
of stockings, two pairs of strong boots or shoes, two strong gowns (one
of which must be made of a warm material), four towels, three sheets
for each berth to be occupied on board ship, and 21bs. of best yellow
soap.
Two or three coloured flannel shirts for men, and an extra supply of
flannel for women and children, are very desirable.
The wear and tear of clothes during the voyage is very considerable,
and passengers should therefore supply themselves with as large a
stock of clean clothes, woollen and others, as their circumstances will
permit. The clothing need not necessarily be all new.
Luggage. —The quantity of luggage allowed to each steerage passenger
is usually from 10 to 20 cubic feet, according to the arrangement made
with the shipowner at the time of engaging the passage. All luggage
should be securely packed in strong boxes or cases, or it will very
likely be spoiled during the voyage. The name of the owner should
always be legibly painted on each box.
Diet Scale. —The following is a scale of diet usually adopted, with
slight variations, for steerage passengers on board ship proceeding to
Australia : Each person over 12 years of age receives weekly 3^-lb. of
meat, 6oz. of suet, 6 oz. of butter, 2£ lb. of biscuit, lb. of flour, 1 lb.
of oatmeal, £ lb. of rice, 2 lbs. of potatoes, or \ lb. of preserved ditto,
peas and other vegetables, 8 ozs. of raisins, 1 oz. of tea, and 2 oz. of
coffee, fib. of sugar, and £lb. of West India molasses, with salt,
pepper, mustard, and pickles, and 3 quarts of water daily. Children
between 1 and 12 years of age receive half rations.
Advice to Emigrants. —Emigrants are recommended not to linger
about the towns at which they may arrive, but to proceed with as
little delay as possible, either to their friends, if they have any in the
colony, or to the localities where they are likely to meet with employ-
ment. To ascertain where their services are most in demand, they
should consult the Government immigrant agent at the port of arrival,
who will assist them with information, and advice that can be relied
on. They should be cautious in trusting strangers. If seeking
employment they should at once accept any fair offer of work, although
the wages may be less than they anticipated.
Names and Addresses of Officers. —The following is a list of the
names and addresses of the Government officers in the United
Kingdom and in the Colonies, to whom emigrants should apply in
any case of difficulty connected with their emigration, either in this
country or in the colonies ;
