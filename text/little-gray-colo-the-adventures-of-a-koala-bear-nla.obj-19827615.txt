LITTLE GRAY COLO
Little Gray Colo, the tree bear, lived in a country
where the sky was always blue and the sun shone
every day.
When he was very small his mother would nurse
him just like any baby, and the swaying branches on
which she sat gently rocked him to sleep.
When his mother climbed about the trees in
which the bears lived little Colo rode snugly on her
back.
Soon Colo grew bigger. One day he went to
visit his aunt, who had four
little bears of her own.


They all slept together hanging on to each other
behind Auntie in the funniest way.
Now four can fit where five are too many, and
Cousin Colo was just one too many for the branch.
Flop! Down he came, tumbling over and over to
the ground—

and there he was
a long way below.


Then, very ruffled, he set off to find his way
home.

Walking over rough ground is not easy
for a little tree bear.
He stumbled,
and scrambled,
and grew very
tired.


Before long he was
completely lost. He
found himself in a
clearing where the
trees had been chop-
ped down. What a
sad sight!
Little Colo felt
very unhappy as he
gazed at the wood-
man’s ax.
He climbed onto
a big log, and cried
himself to sleep.

He awoke with a
start! His log was
moving! It was sail-
ing down the river
with all the other
logs!
No one had no-
ticed the little bear
when the timber
was sent floating down to the mill.

After his first fright Colo thought this was rather
fun. He quite cheered up
Suddenly they came
to rough water, and
all the logs hobbled
and jumbled together.
Colo’s log hit a rock
and threw him high in-
to the air.


Up and up he went, then down he came, right on
top of a little black girl.




Her porridge bowl went flying, and at first she
was very frightened, but she soon forgave Colo and
offered him the rest of her porridge to eat. Colo
thanked her politely.




Then they set off to the camp where her people
lived together in their curious huts.

Colo was quite happy with the little girl until
one night her bad brother carried him off to the
town near by. He sold the little bear for a string
of bright beads.

Now it happened that the young man who
bought Colo was a famous airman.


He was just preparing for a long flight, and he
decided to take the little bear along.

just in case.
Colo thought
a very funny
affair.


Next morning at sunrise they took off. A few
friends waved good-bye.


They traveled all day
and all night for many
days, and these are some.


of the strange things they saw on
their journey.


Colo could hardly believe his eyes.


At last they were near the end of their flight,
somewhere in England.
It was so dark that when they were passing over
London nothing could be seen but thousands of tiny
bright lights.
Just then something seemed to go wrong.
The plane wobbled, and quivered, and soon they
were whizzing down, down, faster and faster toward
the earth.


Bump! Rattle! Crash! and Colo found himself
hurled into a bed of tulips. They had landed in the
park!




He could hear a great many people tramping
about and shouting and cheering.
Nobody was hurt.
Colo dropped his parachute and crept away as
fast as he could over the grass. Presently he came
to another more beautiful park where there was a
lake. The little bear had never seen such green trees
nor such green grass before. They reminded him
that he felt quite hungry.




Bui, oh dear, on looking closer he saw the trees
did not have the right sort of leaves to eat.
He asked the little red squirrels where he could
find some of the leaves that tree bears live on, but
they didn’t understand about eating leaves at all.
They were very sorry.


By this time all the papers were talking about the
missing bear, so when old Ben the park-keeper first
found a little parachute on the grass, and then Colo
himself, he knew the whole story.
Colo was talking to the wood pigeons.


The policeman, who was not at all
used to arresting small bears, hurried off
with him to the police station.
“Well, well, well,” said old Ben, “come
along my little fellow,” and off he marched
with Colo to the nearest policeman.

Colo was hustled in-
to a taxi and away it
sped through the noisy
streets.
The police
sergeant telephoned
the airman.
“Hello there, I
believe you have
lost a bear, sir? Yes,
sir, we’ll send him off to you at once,
sir. He’s leaving right away,” said the
sergeant glancing at the clock.


Everything seemed to be in a hurry and there
were no trees at all here. Colo wondered what
everybody ate.
The taxi went faster and faster

Now the wood pigeons
felt very sorry for Colo
and they had thought
of a plan to help him
find his own friends and
relations again.
So while he was riding in a taxi a message was
traveling faster than an airplane from pigeon to sea
gull, from sea gull to diver,
from diver to pelican, from
pelican to penguin, from
penguin to albatross.

As for Colo, he ar-
rived at the flying field
just in time and was
tucked safely into the
plane. The engine start-
ed and away they flew.
Soon they were over the
sea.
When the plane was nearing
home again, flying low over a
small island, a big albatross
flew alongside, and told Colo
what he was to do

Colo quickly opened the door
and jumped for the big bird’s back.
But, oh help! He fell short and went
whizzing down into space like a
piece of thistledown
Soon, however, his parachute began to
open, and suddenly he was sailing right
side up, in grand style.
The albatross flew about anxiously and
was quite relieved to see Colo and the
parachute drop safely onto the island far
below.


Swish! Colo went crackling
through the leafy treetops, where
he dangled from a bough in the
midst of his surprised relations,
the bears. He was home!
Very soon they had him down safely, and while
Colo ate a hearty meal of young leaves, he learned
how the woodman’s ax had driven all the bears onto
this small island.

tucking himself up in a comfy spot,
he slept alone.
Auntie Bear’s family
was larger than ever.
Colo very politely de-
clined her offer of hospi-
tality. He decided he
was a very experienced
and grown-up bear and,


Colo and the other bears are happy now—safe
on Bears Island, where nobody goes and the wood-
man’s ax is never heard.
