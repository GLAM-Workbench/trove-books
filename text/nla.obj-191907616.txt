FOREWORD
■&J N the construction of this Catalogue, introductory notes
to some of the artists represented have been dispensed
with. The Australian connoisseur is already familiar
with the work of such men as Norman Carter, J. R. Eldershaw,
Griiner, Hans Heysen, Hilder, Reason, Conrad Martens, Roland
Wakelin, and Hardy Wilson, and he will recognise the pictures
as well chosen examples. Of the prints—Baxter, Le Blond, and
other licensees —it should be said that, besides being the most
complete collection yet seen in this country, it is, on account of
the extreme rarity of some of the prints, and more particularly
the Baxteriana, one of the important collections of the world.
As such, its dispersal offers a rare opportunity to the Australian
collector to enrich, perhaps crown, his collection with one of the
unique gems of Baxter. There are ample records to indicate
what values would have been realised had these rarer items been
taken to the old world for auction. It is the vendor’s wish
that, since they have been got together in Australia, they should
remain here if possible.

JOHN VARLEY
15 Landscape, with a Castle
In “A History of British Water-colour Painting,” H. M.
Cunclall says: —“Of the ten men, however, who started the
Society (the Old Water-colour Society), the name of John
Yarley stands out beyond the others. He was born at Hack-
ney on August 17, 1778. . . . He exhibited at the R.A. in
1798. . . . His style is broad, deriving great freshness
from pure tints and facility of treatment. He had a con-
siderable reputation as an art teacher, numbering among his
pupils Turner of Oxford, David Cox, John Tinnell, and
Mulready. ’ ’

Baxter Prints
George Baxter was the inventor of oil-colour printing. He worked
from about 1837 to 1860. As an inventor he is a prominent figure in
the history of colour printing, his process being the first to permit of
artistic colour reproduction in quantity, and at a price at which the
many could become possessed of good pictures. It was superseded by
the cheaper and more mechanical methods of chromo-lithography and
the photographic processes.
It is not only as an inventor, however, that Baxter’s name has
lived and in later years become famous. He was, in fact, more an
artist than a printer, and it is the beauty of his prints that makes
them the coveted collector’s pieces that they are to-day.
Baxter was endowed with rare artistic vision and feeling, which,
allied to his consummate craftsmanship, enabled him to produce prints
the artistic qualities of which give them a place amongst the most
desirable pieces of pictorial art the world has seen.
99 “Dippers and Nest,” and “Little Grebes and Nest”
In Mudies “ British Birds” complete. Yol. 1 has a
prefatory note on Baxter’s process from which it is not desir-
able to separate the print.
99a “Convolvulus”
100 “Polar Sky”
101 “The Dripping Well,” Hastings
102 Tropical Scenery

was the birthplace of George Baxter.

113 “Isola Bella Lago Maggiore.” (A rare print)
114 Summer Fly
114 a “Winter Bird”
115 Vineyard, near Mt. St. Bernard

123 “Paul and Virginia” (large)
124 “The Tarantella”
125 Indian Settlement
126 “FIRST IMPRESSIONS”
A very fine copy of this superb print. It is said to have
been inspired by the incident of Sterne and the Grizette.
127 “Milo of Crotona Bending the Oak”
128 “THE BRIDE” (small)
One of the rarest of Baxter prints, and must not be con-
fused with No. 122. Very few prints were taken from the
plate which, being destroyed, was replaced by the larger
print of the same title. It has a quiet subtle beauty of its
own.
129 “The Chalees Satoon.” (A very popular print)
130 “ENGLAND’S QUEEN”
This, with No. 131, make a splendid pair. Their rich
colour and faithful portraiture is in Baxter’s best manner.

141 Balmoral Castle
142 “The Judgment of Brutus”
143 “SUMMER.” (A very fine print, and extremely rare)
144 The Very Rare and Valuable “PARTING
LOOK”
This print is regarded as one of Baxter’s masterpieces.
As a piece of colour, it is probably equal to anything yet
printed. The handling of the draperies, the delicate flesh
tints, the management of light and shade, and the rendering
of the foliage are excellent, while its size offers evidence
that Baxter was as capable in big work as in small. Neces-
sarily it was costly printing, and only a small number were
issued. To-day the print is extremely rare.
145 River Scene, Holland. (An exquisite colour har-
mony)

GREAT BRITAIN, known sometimes as Queen and

244 THE EXTREMELY RARE AND VALUABLE
PORTRAIT OF EDMUND BURKE
It is probable that the Edmund Burke was printed for
private circulation among the friends of Lord Brougham, in
whose possession was the original picture by Sir Joshua
Reynolds. Writing to Baxter in 1856, Lord Brougham says:
“The Burke we have is very much admired. 7 ’ Only six
copies of the print are known to exist, and of those only two
on mount with inscription as on this, “From the original
picture in the possession of the Rt. Hon. Lord Brougham.

and
252 a “THE ARRIVAL OF HER MOST GRACIOUS
MAJESTY QUEEN VICTORIA AT THE
HOUSE OF LORDS, TO OPEN THE FIRST
PARLIAMENT OF HER REIGN”
Courtney Lewis says of the “Coronation” in the “Picture
Printer”:—“Sketched by Baxter at the ceremony on June
28, 1838, special facilities being given him. . . . The print
usually called the ‘ Coronation ’ is accurate down to fhe
smallest detail, and is undoubtedly Baxter’s greatest effort,
and denotes him as not only a great printer, but a fine
artist. ... It took some years to produce. The Queen,
on whom a ray of light is throwm, is kneeling at the altar,
receiving the sacrament from the Archbishop of Canterbury,
with whom are the Archbishops of York and Armagh, and the
Bishops of London and Bath and Wells. Among the other
distinguished persons shown are Lords John Bussell, Cotten-
ham, Palmerston, Willoughby, d’Eresby (holding the crown),
and Melbourne (the Prime Minister); also the Duchess of
Kent, the Dukes of Sussex, Nemours, Cambridge, and Welling-
ton. , . . With the print was issued a key, and sub-
scribers were invited by a prospectus. Numerous well-known
and influential persons became patrons, including Queen
Victoria herself, Prince Albert, the Duchess of Kent, the
Duke of Cambridge, several foreign potentates, and many
noblemen. Probably not many of the prints in colours were
circulated. . . . Very rarely does a perfect copy come
into the market. The colouring, register, and the artistic
finish are marvels of printing.”
252 a the ‘ ‘ Opening of Parliament ’ ’ he says, in the

signature ‘G. Baxter’; and the only print signed in this way,
or at all, until 1848, and it is worthy of observation that
this is signed, and the companion (No. 252) is not.
The Lord Chancellor, carrying the purse, and accompanied
by his mace-bearer, heads the procession, which iis seen
approaching through the Eoyal Gallery of the House of
Lords, into which a November fog seems to have pene-
trated. Many notable persons in reply to Baxter’s prospectus
became patrons. ... It shares with the ‘Coronation’ the
merit of being one of Baxter’s two finest productions; but,
like that print, no large number in colours was circulated,
and a print very seldom comes into the market. . . .
It has often been a question in what way he produced the
appearance of fog in the building.”

254 A “Baxter” photograph—“ The Bavarian Marriage”
George Baxter was one of the first to exploit photography
commercially. On retirement from his printing business he
issued a series of photographic pictures, of which the above
is one. To-day it is an interesting and rare Baxter item.
255 An original water-colour (by George Baxter)
256 A MINIATURE IN OILS OF GEORGE
BAXTER (by George Baxter, Junr.)
This is unique. The portraiture is true, and excellently
handled. No piece of Baxteriana could be more intimate.
It is in the original frame.
257 MEDALS (in Replica) WON BY GEORGE
BAXTER
This is another unique Baxter item. The originals are in
the British Museum. These are probably the rarest piece of
Baxteriana extant.

Baxter)
259 A Set of Needle Prints, showing Plate in
Developing States. (An interesting item relative
to the process)
260 A RARE AND INTERESTING LETTER (from

Devereux Bros, were a firm of printers contemporary with
Baxter. In this letter they agree to pay Baxter £5OO for

BAXTER’S SALE, 1860
A relic of Baxter’s business, contains interesting data
concerning some of the prints.
262 An etching of the birthplace of John Baxter
263 “THE BAVARIAN MARRIAGE”
A working pull from what is said to be Baxter’s last plate.
No print was produced from this plate, but the pull here
submitted bears every indication of Baxter’s work.


Baxterotypes
These prints were made by Baxter, who adapted photo-
graphy to a process of his own’, and called the result a “Baxter-
otype.” He used this process between the years 1853 and 1857.
At that time the Daguerreotpye was becoming popular, and
Baxter no doubt offered these as his substitute for them.
To-day they are rare, and a representative collection should
have at least one example.

The “ Dover’’ is regarded as the best of the Baxterotypes.
and is said to be truthful in every way to the actual view.


Baxter Prints in Tint and in Black
The great printer produced in monochrome and in black as
well as. in colour. In many instances they reached very high
pictorial quality but, of course, were not so popular in the days
of their production. For this reason some of them are rarer
than the coloured prints of the same subject. The “Opening
of Parliament,” and the small “Summer” are fine examples of
the tint prints, while “Lake Lucerne,” “The Shipwreck,” and
“Day Before Marriage” are particularly good in black. The
“Queen on Dais” is one of the rarest pieces in the collection.
LOT
273 “Bohemian Peasants”
274 Outside Set of Three Groups of Flowers
This is an extremely rare Baxter item, three prints in

ing is in body of the print.
291 ITALY
This is an extremely rare and interesting print. Whether
it was printed by Baxter or Le Blond is somewhat in doubt,
There is no doubt, however, that Baxter engraved the plate
and printed in tint from it. On the other hand, there is no
evidence that Le Blond ever printed it in tint. It would be
safe to call it a Le Blond-Baxter.

Licensees
(Other than Le Blond)
The items hereunder are by printers to whom Baxter granted
licenses. In some instances it will be seen that the work is very
little inferior to that of the great inventor himself. In all of
them there is to be found the charm peculiar to' the process.
Messrs. Kronheim & Co. are considered the mbst important
of the lesser licensees. They used the process largely for book
illustration, frequently to fine effect, as witness No. 303,
“Ophelia,” an illustration to “Hamlet.” They also pub-
lished prints on mounts, and in these they achieved
most excellent results; Nos. 297 and 308 for instance, are pictorially
scarcely inferior to Baxter’s—the difference is one of technique.
Then there are Messrs. Diekes, Bradshaw and Blacklock, Mansell,
and Vincent, Brooks, Day & Son. There are sufficient prints
here to show the quality these printers were able to get with
the process. The “Queen Victoria,” No. 318, is a notable
licensee print. It was the frontispiece to a folio published
by Bradshaw and Blacklock, and is recognised as the high-water
mark of their production.

Le Blond Prints
Abraham Le Blond was the most important of Baxter’s
licensees. He produced more prints, and in the main, better
prints than any other of those to whom the inventor granted
licenses. Frequently his work in artistic execution approximates
closely to Baxter’s, while his choice of subject shows him to have
been a man keenly sensible to the artistic value of the homelier
incidents of the life of his period. It would appear that Le Blond
was able to grasp the essentials of the process, assimilate them,
and make them servant to his own expression. His prints are not
inferior to Baxter’s—especially if we regard his own designs—
but different, and a preference for either is largely a matter of
individual taste. The modern collector has recognised this, with
the result that Le Blond’s values have greatly increased, and in
some cases equal those of Baxter’s.
