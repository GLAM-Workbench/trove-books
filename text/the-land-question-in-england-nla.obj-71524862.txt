Since issuing Tract No. 1, the last English mail brought an
essay in the Westminster Review on the Land Question in England.
I had already collected materials for another tract, but the
reasoning in the article in question seemed to me to be so forcible,
and the facts quoted and illustrations given so opportune to our
circumstances, that I have postponed what I had already prepared
for future use, and have selected what appeared most suitable
from the Review for Tract No. 2. In addition to the extract from
the Review I have added a few pertinent notes from Carpenter's
Political Text Boole, some of which have not strictly a direct
bearing on our subject; but, as the Land Question embraces in its
ramifications almost every element of political economy, I think
it will not require much critical acumen in my readers to detect
the latent bearing of every idea contained in the extracts on our
main question. One excellent reason why the subject of the
State being the sole landlord should be selected from the mass of
crude, contradictory, and oppressive legislation that exists, is, that
the most superficial examination of the subject leads to such a
wide field of suggestive thought, and prepares the proselyte to the
new political faith for the further reforms legitimately interwoven
with our subject, which is dynamic and central in its nature,
liberating to an ingenuous mind, and solves so many otherwise
dark and distressing social problems.
The plan I have proposed to myself in carrying out this series
of tracts, is to lay before the public the most powerful ai'guments,
facts, and illustrations I can command, bearing on the case, and
subsequently summarising the whole ; and, surveying our own ex-
perience, attempt to support the application of the principle of the
State being the sole landlord to the colony.

THE LAND QUESTION IN ENGLAND.
(From the ? Westminster Review ? for October.)
1. The contrast between England of the fifteenth and England
of the nineteenth century in regard to the tenure and occupation of
the land is positively startling. At the former period, according to
Chancellor Fortescue, England was noted throughout Europe for the
number of her freeholders and for the general prosperity of her
inhabitants. ? The country,? he tells us, ? was then so filled and
replenished with landed men, that therein so small a little hamlet
cannot be found where dwelleth not a knight, an esquire, or such
a householder as is there called a Franklin, enriched with great
possessions, and also other freeholders and other yeomen After
this manner are none other realms of this world disposed and
inhabited. For though there be in them men of great power, of
great riches and possessions, yet they dwell not nigh one to another
as such great men do in England; neither so many inheritors and
possessors of land are elsewhere as in England.?
2. Two centuries later, according to Gregory King?s estimate,
the small freeholders were still a very numerous body. In 1688
there were in England 40,000 families ?freeholders of the better
sort,? and 140,000 ?freeholders of the lesser sort;? in all 180,000
families possessing freehold estates. This is exclusive of the higher
nobility, baronets, knights, esquires, and gentlemen, who are classified
separately and number 16,560 families, all of which were the owners
of more or less land. Taking therefore Gregory King?s estimate of
the total number of landed families of all ranks and conditions at
849,000, it would appear that one family in every four were free-
holders at the time he lived. How different the state of things
at the present day, when one half of England is owned by 150, and
19J millions of acres in Scotland are owned by 12 persons !* (P. 233.)
3. The facts stated imply a great and radical change. The
question arises: ?Has this change been beneficial or otherwise 1 Is
employment, in proportion to population, more abundant 1 Is
labour, taking other things into account, better remunerated 1 Are
the people as a whole more prosperous than formerly, in regard to
The Land Question. ?It is rumoured that the first article in the current
number of the Westminster Review ?than on the Land Question in England
?is from the pen of Mr. D. Syme, a well-known Melbourne journalist.?
Athenceum, 15th Oct.
* The total number of landowners in England at the date of the last census
was 30,766; but this includes the owners of building sites, town and suburban
allotments.


their material comforts and social condition? These questions, we
fear, cannot be answered in the affirmative. On the contrary, it
must be admitted that the change has been an unfortunate and in
many respects a disastrous one for the country. (P, 234.)
4. It is not a mere coincidence that the introduction of pauperism
in England was contemporaneous with the extinction of the class of
small freeholders and farmers. The connection between them was
that of cause and effect. In England, in former days, the nobility,
it is true, held large estates, but they did not monopolize the whole
land of the country. Between each large estate there were
numerous small freeholds, owned and cultivated by a class of
yeomen; while at the same time large spaces all over the country
were specially reserved from appropriation, and set apart for the
common use of the people. The small freeholds began to be
absorbed into the large estates about the middle of the fifteenth
century. About the same time a great demand arose for wool.
English wool was then in great repute all over Europe for manufac-
turing purposes, and the price was so high that the landowners
found it more profitable to grow wool than any other kind of agri-
cultural produce. With a view to meet the increased demand for
this article, immense areas of laud were laid down in pasture all over
the country. But land laid down in pasture employs less labour
than if devoted to tillage; and thousands of labourers were conse-
quently thrown out of employment. When remonstrated with for
the course they were taking in depriving so many people of a liveli-
hood, the landowners, in terms which express the now prevailing
notions with regard to the rights of property, replied?? Have we
not a right to do as we like with our own?? and carried the day.
Large and small farms alike were appropriated to pasture, and the
fate of the small farmer was sealed. The clearance system was then
for the first time adopted, and it w 7 as remorselessly carried
out. ?As for turning men out of a hold,? says a writer of this
period, ? they take it for no offence, but say the land is their own,
and so they turn them out of their strouds like mice. Thousands
in England, through such, beg now from door to door, who have
kept honest houses.? Again, the author of a tract published in
1581 says, ? Sheep are the causes of our mischief; they have driven
husbandry out of the country; now it is altogether sheep, sheep,
sheep! 1 have known a dozen of ploughs within six miles abandoned,
laid down within seven years; and where threescore persons and
upwards had their livings, now one man with his cattle hath all.?
But the evil had become serious long before this, for in 1489 we find
the Legislature, recognising the fact that land, unlike other property,
was not to be used for the exclusive benefit of the owner, had enacted
a statute providing that all farmhouses should be maintained with
a competent quantity of land, under penalty of seizure of half
the profits. Again, the 25th of Henry YIII. declared that the ac-
cumulations of farms had reduced ? a vast multitude ? of the people
to poverty and misery, and forbade any man to have more than two
farms, or to keep on hired land more than two thousand sheep; and
the sth and 6th of Edward VI. required that as much land should


be kept in tillage as had heretofore been the case. Shocking
evidences these, it will be said, of the ignorance of our ancestors as
to the first principles of political economy. However, one way or
another, the process of accumulation went on till there were few
small freeholds left in the country. Then the commons began to
disappear. From 1670 till 1867 no less than 7,000,000 of acres of
commons have been swallowed up by the Enclosure Acts, and gone
to increase the already large estates of adjoining proprietors. Aa
the work of accumulation proceeded on the one hand, so did the im-
poverishment of the people on the other, till the net result showed
itself in the hideous shape of pauperism, which was formally recog-
nised by the Act of Parliament in the reign of Elizabeth, when the
poor rates were made compulsory. {P. 235.)
5, Not only is our present land system responsible for the deterio-
ration of our farm labourers, and in a great measure for the advance
of pauperism and crime, but to it we are indebted for the ever-in-
creasing burden of taxation. According to the law of England, the
land belongs' to the Crown. When originally granted to private
individuals its tenure was subject to certain conditions, generally of
military service, and it was resumable by the Crown if these condi-
tions were not complied with. In those days the land was the only
source of revenue for the State. It provided for the poor, main-
tained justice, supported armies, and bore all the imposts of the
community. ?The early European system,? says Hallam, ?knew
neither the necessities nor the ingenuities of modern finance. From
the demesne lands the Kings of France and Lombardy supplied the
?common expenses of a barbarous court. Even Charlemagne regulated
the economy of his farms with the minuteness of a steward, and a
large portion of his capitularies are directed to this object. Their
actual revenue was chiefly derived from free gifts made according to
an ancient German custom, at the annual assemblies of the nation,
from amercements paid by the allodial proprietors for default of
military service, and from the freda, or fines accruing to the judges
out of composition for murder. These amounted to one-third of the
whole weregild; one-third of this was paid over by the court to the
royal exchequer. After the feudal government prevailed in France,
and neither the heribannum nor the weregild continued in use,
there seem to have been hardly any sources of regular revenue
besides the domainal estates of the crown.?
From the meanest vassal to the proudest noble all had a personal
and material interest in the soil; <prd in proportion to the extent
and fertility of the land held by each, were his obligations to the
State increased or diminished. The feudal system was at least an
equitable one, which is more than can be said of the one we have
substituted in its place. Military service was then, in the strictest
sense, a rent-charge on the land; the lords of the soil were simply
tenants of the Crown, neither more nor less. Now, however, since
military tenures have been abolished, and the expenditure of the
Government is maintained by a general system of taxation, we do
not find that the rents have reverted to the State. Modern land-
owners claim the rights, but have taken good care to disown the


obligations of their position. They have adroitly managed to
relieve themselves of their burdens by transferring them to the
shoulders of the people; and, being legislators as well as land-
owners, they found little difficulty in giving the sanction of the law
to their proceedings. In the first place, they substituted a pecuni-
ary assessment for military service, and then made the assessment so
low that it was found necessary to supplement it. In other words,
they retained their rents and provided a substitute in the shape of
customs and excise duties. (P. 240.)
6. Another evil attending our land system is, that while the land
itself is constantly increasing in value, we have no corresponding
contribution from that increase in aiding to defray our public ex-
penditure. If the land in feudal times, when the soil was cultivated
in the rudest manner, was able to maintain its poor and defray all
the expenses of State, ordinary and extraordinary, why should it
not do as much now, with all our scientific acquirements, our steam
ploughs and thrashing machines, our improved live stock, and our
vast and varied experience of the capabilities of our soil and
climate 1 (P. 241.)
7. It is population, with its necessities, which in the first instance
gives land its value. In the earlier stages of society a few wander-
ing tribes occupy a large territory, and land is almost valueless. As
population increases land is more appreciated, and flocks and herds
supersede the less useful animals of the chase. After a further
increase of the population, and when cultivation has been resorted
to, a new and distinct value is given to the land. As yet, however,
it is not a saleable commodity, for where every one has as much of
it as he can use, there is little or no demand, consequently no
purchasers, and no rent, as rent only becomes possible when a still
further increase of population renders the supply inadequate to the
demand. It is evident, therefore, that population is the source of
all value in land. Without population there can be no market for
agricultural produce, and without a market the produce and the
land from which it is raised are alike valueless. The farther removed
the land is from a market, the less is its value; the nearer and
better the market, the more valuable the land. (P. 243.)
8. In the Western States of America land is cheap and popula-
tion sparse; as you proceed towards the seaboard population becomes
denser, and land more valuable. In Australia, it is said, land near
the centres of population is let as high as 75,, 10s., and even 20s. an
acre, the tenant fencing and clearing the land, and making all the
necessary improvements; while equally good land is in the interior,
but at a distance from market, let as low as twopence and three-
pence an acre. Here it is clear that population alone gives value to
the land. The landowner, in fact, need not expend a shilling on
improvements. He may neglect his property; he may lose sight of
it altogether; he maybe an absentee; still its value goes on increas-
ing if population settle in the neighbourhood, and he will ultimately
reap the benefit of this increase through no effort of his own. In
the same manner the tenant would not be able to pay a high rent
for the use of his farm unless he got a corresponding high price for


his produce. On the consumers therefore falls the burden of high
rents. Thus Mr. Caird found that while the rent of land in the
districts he visited had increased 100 per cent, daring the eighty years
previous, the price of meat had also increased 70 per cent., and the
price of butter and wool 100 per cent, during the same period. It
is evident therefore that if the land belonged to the State instead of
to private individuals, as in England, income and expenditure would
be self-adjusting, increased expenditure caused by increased popula-
tion would be met by a corresponding increase in the rents from
land. (P. 244.) ~
9. There is no reason why England at this moment should not
supply food enough, and more than enough,'for her own population.
There is no want of land, for out of the 77J millions of acres in the
United Kingdom, only 45| millions are under cultivation or in
permanent grass, the remaining 32 millions are lying waste though
fully one-half is capable of cultivation. Yet there is no real lack of
capital, for English capital is going a begging all over the world.
There are tens of thousands of acres of land in Canada, in Australia,
and other colonial possessions, in which English capital has been
invested to the extent of �4O or �5O an acre in clearing alone,
which are now growing grain for the English market. And heaven
knows there is no deficiency of labour. At the present moment
there are said to be not less than 150,000 able-bodied poor amongst
us whom it would be a charity to turn to some profitable account.
Just imagine the wealth that all the labour now going to waste
might create! Why, it is not far short of the total of the able-
bodied population of the colony of Victoria, who raise an annua
revenue of �3,000,000, and own rateable property of the value of
over �40,000,000, nearly the whole of which has been acquired in
less than half a generation. But we must add to these 150,000 able-
bodied paupers the number of able-bodied labourers who are con-
tinually going about in search of work, those employed on half-time,
and the criminal class in penal servitude, altogether making an
unemployed able-bodied population of something like a million.
What if increased production did lead to low prices? Are we to
keep down production in order to keep up prices? Is it nothing
that the standard of living throughout the country would be raised
and that the means of subsistence would be within the reach of
thousands who can now barely keep body and soul together ? And
would not cheap food, which is so essential to cheap production,
enable us to maintain our present pre-eminence in manufacturing
industry, now endangered by the High price of provisions? (1. 24b )
10. The present system is, moreover, an unwarrantable monopoly
in an era of free-trade, and a mischievous absolutism in a free state.
We cannot believe we are in our proper position as a people while
we allow a large part of our population to starve, our resources to
be wasted, and the land, which should contribute to the wealth of
the nation, misappropriated in the manner it is at this moment.
Unlike an ordinary commodity, land cannot be increased in quantity
at pleasure. Its ownership is a monopoly. We pride ourselves on
being a free people, but we submit to an absolutism on the part ot


the landowners which is a disgrace to our civilisation. A landowner
in this country is endowed with more than sovereign power. A
sovereign reigns for the good of his people, a landowner for his own
pleasure and profit. The public may concern themselves much
about the rights of property, but the owners of property need not
give themselves the slightest trouble about the interests of the
public. Blackstone says that ? every Englishman may claim a right
to abide in his own country so long as he pleases, and not be driven
from it, except by sentence of the law,? but times have changed
since Blackstone?s day. The landowner is the man in possession,
and possession is nine-tepths of the law. The land is his, and he
may do exactly as he likes with it. He may refuse to sell, let, or
allow any one to occupy it. He may consign a whole county to
the solitude of a deer forest. He may clear a large territory of its
population as he would exterminate vermin when they become
troublesome. Fifteen thousand souls, without respect to age, sex,
or condition, and for no fault of their own, were turned out of the
Sutherland estates in the early part of the present century. And
this barbarity was committed in open day, and in the name of law!
But if one landowner can act in this manner, why not all; and since
all the land is owned by some one or other, where are we to draw
the line? And if landlords have, as they maintain, legal right to do
so, it is clear that the English people exist merely on the sufferance
of the landowners, who are truly masters of the situation; that as a
nation we have no locus standi, no common inheritance, no territorial
rights whatever. (P. 247.)
11. The importance of the land revenue to the Government of
India may be imagined from the fact that it forms the principal
portion of the national income. Even now, notwithstanding the
waste and mismanagement inevitable where the rents are assessed
and collected by strangers, ignorant of the capabilities of the country,
and of the customs of its inhabitants, the revenue from land alone,
previous to the mutiny, met all the expenditure of the Empire ex-
cept military charges, which, in a conquered country, are necessarily
heavy. The expenditure included public works, navy, mint, in-
terest on debt, and pensions; and if we deduct waste and alienated
land, the revenue to meet this large expenditure was derived from
about one-sixth of the whole territory. (P. 250.)
12. A great many plans have been proposed to give security of
tenure to the cultivator, but they may be resolved into three. The
first is, that the Legislature shall make it compulsory on landlords
to grant leases to their tenants. This plan, if honestly carried out
on the part of the landlords, w'ould be a great improvement on the
present practice; but it would not be sufficient to meet all the re-
quirements of the case. Long before the expiration of the lease, if
it became known that it would not be renewed, or a new one agreed
upon, the tenant would begin to work out his land, so that by the
time the lease actually fell in, the soil would be so impoverished that
it would take years to recover its fertility. This is the practice at
present all over the world where leases exist, and it is ruinous to
both landlord and tenant. Nor would the tenant have any great


inducement to incur expenditure in permanent improvements under
such a tenure?unless the leases were for a long period, and the
conditions so stringent as practically to deprive the landlord of any
control over his property. The second is, that the laws of primo-
geniture and entail be abolished, the transfer of land made easy
and cheap, so that, like any other commodity, the land might pass
freely into other hands, and ultimately come into the possession of
those who could make a better use of it than its present owners.
This at best would be but a slow, tedious, and, after all, a very un-
satisfactory way of meeting the difficulty. First, because the land
would be as much beyond the reach of the actual cultivator as it is
at present; secondly, because there is no probability that even if the
land changed hands, the claims of the actual cultivator would be con-
sidered any more than at present; and thirdly, even granting that
the plan succeeded to the extent contemplated by some advocates,
it would be virtually postponing the remedy to an indefinite period,
The Encumbered Estates Act, Sir Robert Peel?s measure for the
pacification of Ireland, has now been in operation for a quarter of a
century, but the land hunger of the Irish people is in no way ap-
peased, and agrarian outrages are as rife as ever. The sale of con-
fiscated land in France, at the time of the Revolution, effected an
important change, it is true, but the circumstances were totally differ-
ent from what they are with us at the present day. In France im-
mense quantities of land were thrown upon the market at once, and
there could be no competition on the part of the wealthier classes,
who were either imprisoned, guillotined, or had left the country;
the land consequently was purchased at a low price by the cultivators,
who were the only applicants. In England, however, there are no
large quantities of land for sale, and even if there were, the competi-
tion would be of the keenest, and the land would inevitably come
into possession of those classes who would hold it on precisely the
same terms as at present. (P. 256.)
13. Another plan is that which was proposed by Mr. Bright for
Ireland ?namely, that the Government should purchase the estates
of the great landlords and re-sell to the tenants their present hold-
ings, the tenants to re-pay the State by yearly instalments. Security
of tenure to the cultivator would undoubtedly be obtained by this
means, but it is at best but the old cumbersome method over again.
It is unnecessary, in the first place, that the cultivator should own
the land at all. Secondly, it is undesirable to compel him to buy,
as thereby he becomes crippled in lus means, the capital required for
working his land being absorbed in its purchase. The bad effect of
this system is seen in France, where the small freeholds as a rule are
heavily mortgaged, and the farmers are impoverished by having to
pay a high rate of interest for the use of their money. Thirdly, we
doubt if the State would be justified in taking the land from one set
of owners and simply handing it over to another set. And lastly,
the scheme is objectionable because it provides no guarantee against
a reversion of the land to the person from whom it was purchased,
and the renewal of the old process of absorption.
14. There is however a simpler and more efficient plan than any


of these. Let the Grown resume possession of the whole of the agri-
cultural and unreclaimed land in the kingdom , and compensate the
owners at so many years' purchase at the present rents. Let it retain
possession of the land and lease it, in blocks of from ten to two hundred
acres in extent, the leases to he for a period of thirty years. At the
expiration of that period let the land he valued, and if it has increased
in value in the interval, whether owing to the enterprise of the tenant
or toother causes beyond his control, let him have his lease renewed for
another period of thirty years, conditionally on his paying, in addi-
tion to the old rent, one-half the value that has accrued since the com-
mencement of his tenure* This plan, we think, would meet all the
requirements. The cultivator would have what is so necessary to
him, security of tenure, and ample encouragement afforded him to
effect all necessary improvements ; the man of small capital would
have an opportunity of acquiring a holding suited to his means;
while the landlord ( i.e ,, the State) and tenant would each receive his
fair proportion of the value that might accrue to the land during
occupation. (P. 257.)
15. The social advantages of this arrangement would be incalcu-
lable. No one who calmly considers our social condition can believe
it to be a desirable one. Society in England is now divided into
two well-defined classes. On the one side there are those who receive
wages, and on the other side those who pay them. At the taking of
the last census there were no less than 5,000,000 male adults in the
United Kingdom in receipt of wages. Reckoning one male adult
to represent a family of four and a half persons, the wages class
would thus number 22,500,000 in a population of 29,058,888
persons, being more than two to one of the entire population. The
wages class is thus out of all proportion to the rest of the community.
This is both a new and an alarming feature of modern society; for
not only does the wages class far outnumber the other sections of
the population, but there is also an antagonism between them that
formerly did not exist. The old ties of sympathy and common
interest which bound together the master and his workman have
been rudely broken. What is the employer?s interest is no longer
the interest of the workman; the temper of the latter is soured
towards his employer, and the employer looks with suspicion on the
workman. For years they have been getting farther and farther
apart, and now they stand forth in two alarmingly distinct and
compact masses. On the one side wealth and influence, and on the
other poverty and numbers. As for what are called the middle-
classes in English society, they have year by year been showing less
sympathy with the working classes, and now they openly range
themselves on the other side. The wages class hitherto has shown
no disposition to lawlessness, for the very simple reason that it has
never really felt its power. But with their trade organisations
ramifying everywhere, there is no telling w 7 hen they may both feel
and assert it. It is well always to look danger in tlxe face, and try
if possible to avert it. In this case the danger can be averted only
* The italics are my own.?W. H. G.


by restoring the balance of society. The people have been driven
from the soil; let them be restored to it, and they will become
identified with the progress and prosperity of the country. (P. 258.)
16. There are also economic advantages of the highest order to be
considered. High as the price of land in England now is, it cannot
be said to have arrived at its maximum value. Gradually, for
centuries, we have seen this value increasing; and while we continue
to add to our population, and the country remains prosperous, the
land will go on increasing in value. It would be absurd to attempt
to limit the natural increase of the value of land. And this increase
being natural, not artificial or the result of any effort or expenditure
on the part of the landowner, it has become a question with the
political economist as to how far the landowner (being a private
individual) is entitled to an increase so obtained 1 But whatever
increases the fertility or productiveness of the soil, or reduces the
expenses of cultivation, also increases the value of the land, and both
will be secured under the plan we have suggested. (1.) There is
the subdivision of the large farms into small ones. It is a well-
known fact that small farms always command a higher rent than
large ones. The subdivision of labour is admitted to be the correct
thing in manufactures, and so will subdivis'on of the soil be found
to be in agriculture. (2.) There is the security of tenure afforded
by a thirty years? lease, renewable at the end of that period, which
would undoubtedly induce the leaseholder to make extensive im-
provements. (3.) There would be no difficulty in obtaining capital
on such a tenure. The millions of English capital now let out on
doubtful securities abroad would be recalled and freely invested in
improvements at home. An enormous amount of capital might be
absorbed in drainage and other permanent improvements. It has
been stated on good authority, that only two millions out of seventy-
seven and a half millions of acres in the United Kingdom are at
present drained. That capital so invested would bring in a sure and
steady income, and large profit to the investors, there can be little
doubt. (4.) Science too will aid in the work of improvement.
Agriculture has derived great advantages from scientific discovery
during this and the last half century; physiology has taught us how
to improve our breeds of cattle and sheep; chemistry has shown us
the constituents of the soil, and the mode of supplying the defi-
ciencies of each; mechanical discovery has furnished us with im-
proved farm implements, and applied steam to the cultivation of
the soil. But who can doubt but that we are yet only on the
threshold of discovery, and that the next half century will supply
results more startling than any we have yet obtained 1 ? (P. 260.)
17. Such being the tendency of land to increase in value , why
should not the State look forward to this ever-increasing value as a
source of revenue ? Under a liberal system of land tenure the present
rentals of the country might be doubled , or even trebled , in a quarter
of a century.* This is no mere random assertion, but a moderate
estimate. Every one knows that the rental of many farms has been
* The italics are my own. ?W. H. G.


doubled or trebled in a few years? time by drainage alone; and if
this can be done on a small scale, why not on a large one! Here,
then, is a source of revenue entirely undeveloped. Here is an oppor-
tunity for inaugurating free-trade in reality, for, carefully managed,
the land revenue in time might become sufficient for all the require-
ments of the State. Then might customs and excise duties be
abolished, and with their abolition trade and commerce would ex-
pand, manufacturing industry increase, every new house or factory
erected would be an addition to the capital of the State; every soul
added to the population, instead of a burden, would only be the
means of increasing the national property. At present the public oc-
cupies the position of an improving tenant who is subject to a rack-
rent?the more he improves the higher the rent he has to pay. If
we cannot escape the rack-rent, let us at least get compensation for
our improvements. (P. 260.)
18. There are certain collateral advantages to be derived from the
State being the owner of the land, to which we need only passingly
refer. Where there is one landlord for all properties, there need be
no difficulty about carrying out improvements, when once they have
been determined on. Roads, railways, canals, drainage, and irriga-
tion works may be carried through the various holdings without
vexatious delay or expensive litigation. Population need not be
cooped up in unhealthy nooks and corners because the adjoining
proprietor forbids the extension of the town in the only direction in
which it is possible. Manufacturers need not be compelled to build
their mills in unsuitable localities because landowners object to tall
chimneys, but may select those places where labour is cheap and
raw material convenient. Some of the most important manufactur-
ing towns in England, Scotland, and Ireland owe their existence to
the fact that the land in the locality happened originally to belong
to some freeholder who was not averse to dispose of it; and scores
of mines that now employ hundreds of thousands of men and millions
of capital were long unopened simply because the great landlords
hated contact with a manufacturing population. At whatever point
of the question we look, we see the beneficial effects which a change
of ownership in regard to the land would have on all classes of the
community, the manufacturer and merchant as well as the farmer, the
half-starved labourer, and the able-bodied pauper. (P. 261.)
19. The plan which is here ?proposed for the settlement of this great
social and economical question will no doubt he denounced as revolu-
tionary. Let it he at once frankly acknowledged that it is so, as the
term revolution is now generally understood. A revolution is hut
another name for a thorough reform, and a thorough reform of our
land system is urgently required . It is no use attempting half-
measures when whole ones answer better, and are as easily carried.*
Our late Reform Act, which transferred the government of the
country from the landed proprietors (heretofore the real rulers) to the
working classes, was a revolution, and that of no ordinary kind;
but it requires to be supplemented by another revolution which will

rescue the land from its present wasteful and cruel usage, and make it
available for the requirements and welfare of the entire com-
munity.
20. We deny that the landowners of this country as a body are
entitled to much consideration. They have abused their trust and
shirked their responsibilities; they claim that the land, their property,
should be treated as ordinary property, while they prevent, by their
settlements, its being made available for the payment of their just
debts; they have been themselves grasping and intolerant; to a
man they resist any attempt to control them in their dealings with
their tenants; they refuse security of tenure to the farmer, which is
one of the main elements of productive farming; they prefer sub-
servient tenants to increased productiveness; they harass their
tenants by impossible conditions, and plunder them by their game
laws; they see in every labourer a possible encumbrance, and
whether as pauper, or proletaire, they take good care to get rid of
him. They have shown utter heartlessness in clearing their estates
of the poor, and gross dishonesty in throwing the burden of their
maintenance on others. The Roman patricians, like them, seized the
public land and used it for their own pleasure and profit, but as
some compensation they threw open the ports and gave free distri-
bution of grain ; our patricians, however, not content with a mono-
poly of the land, long insisted on a monopoly of the market also.
As a class they produce nothing, if we except paupers and poachers,
and are rather a hindrance in the way of producers than otherwise.
Their training and education unfit them for the business-manage-
ment of their estates, and Irish absenteeism has shown us how little
we should lose were they to take themselves off altogether.
21. At least one man in our century understood the full impor-
tance of this subject, and had he lived we need be in no doubt as to
the part he would have played in bringing it prominently before the
public. In his last speech in the House of Commons Mr. Cobden
said : ?? If I were twenty-five or thirty years old instead of twice
that number, I would take Adam Smith in my hand, and I would
have a league for free-trade in land as we have had a league for free-
trade in corn. There is just the same authority in Adam Smith for
the one as for the other, and if the matter were only properly taken
up, not as a revolutionary or chartist notion, but as a step in
political economy, I believe success would attend the effort; and I
say this, if you can apply free-trade to land and labour too?that is,
by getting rid of the abominable restrictions in your parish settle-
ments and the like?then I say the man who does that will have
done more for the English poor than we have been able to do by
the application of free-trade to commerce.? The man who carried
the anti-corn law agitation to a successful issue saw and acknow-
ledged that his work was not half done, that it was only commenced
in fact; that a sweeping change in our land system was required;
and to accomplish this he was prepared to devote all his energy and
all his power of body and mind. Will any one follow in his foot-
steps and finish the work so nobly begun 1 Let us only look at
this question in all its broad issues, and grapple with it promptly


and manfully, as becomes a nation fully conscious of the overwhelm-
ing nature of its responsibilities. (P. 262.)
1. In proportion as nations have become great and powerful, and
have made advances in wealth and acquirements, the mass of misery
corrupting and rankling at their base has also continued progressively
to be enlarged, until it may be truly said that the foundations of
society are laid in wretchedness, and that there is no addition made
to the superstructure of luxury and of wealth, without a more than
corresponding enlargement of the sphere of misery below.
2. Civil rulers cannot be considered as having any claims that are
co-extended with those of the people, nor as forming a party separate
? from the nation. They are appointed by the community to execute
its will, and not to oppose it; to manage the public , not to pursue any
private or particular interests.
3. As we are not to live for ever ourselves, and other generations
are to follow us, w r e have neither the power nor the right to govern
them, nor to say how they shall govern themselves. It is the
summit of human vanity, and shows a covetousness of power beyond
the grave, to be dictating to the world to come. It is sufficient that
we do that which is right in our own day, and leave them with the
advantage of good examples. . , . If it was made an article in
the constitution, that all laws and acts should cease of themselves in
thirty years, and have no legal force beyond that time, it would
prevent their becoming too numerous and voluminous, and serve to
keep them within view, and in a compact compass. Such as were
proper to be continued, would be enacted again; and those which
were not, would go into oblivion.
4. God has given the earth to the children of men, and He has,
undoubtedly, in giving it to them, given them what is abundantly
sufficient for all their exigencies; not a scanty, but a most liberal
provision for them all. The Author of our nature has written it
strongly in that nature, and has promulgated the same law in His
written Word, that man shall eat his bread by his labour; and I am
persuaded that no man, and no combinations of men, for their own
ideas of their particular profit, can, without great impiety, undertake
to say that he shall not do so; that they have no sort of right
either to prevent the labour, or withhold the bread.
5. The capitalists permit the labourers to have the means of sub-
sistence, because they cannot do without labour, contenting them-
selves very generously with taking every particle of produce not
necessary to this purpose. It is the overwhelming nature of the
demands of capital, sanctioned by the laws of society, sanctioned by
the customs of men, enforced by the legislature, which keep, wdiich
ever have kept, and which ever will keep, as long as they are allowed
and acquiesced in, the labourer in poverty and misery.
6. Mr. Ricardo has justly defined the price of labour to be such a
quantity of commodities as will enable the labourers, one with
another, to subsist, and to perpetuate their race, without either
increase or diminution. Such is all which the nature of profit or
interest on capital will allow them to receive, and such has ever


been their reward. The capitalist must give the labourers this sum,
for it is the condition he must fulfil in order to obtain labourers; it
is the limit which nature places to his claims, but he never will
give, and never has given more.
7. The contest now appears to be between masters and journey-
men, or between one species of labour and another; but it will soon
be displayed in its proper characters, and will stand confessed a war
of honest industry against the idle profligacy which has so long ruled
the affairs of the political world with undisputed authority?which
has, for its own security, added honour and political power to
wealth, and has conjoined exclusion and disgrace with the poverty it
has inflicted on the labourer. On the side of the labourers there is
physical strength, for they are more numerous than their opponents.
They are also fast losing that reverence for their opponents which
was and is the source of their power, and they are daily acquiring a
moral strength which results from a common interest and a close
and intimate union.
8. The mismanagement to which society has been so long sub-
jected, threatens on all hands the most tremendous consequences;
and our statesmen and legislators, whenever invited or urged to
grapple with the difficulties, and suppress some of the most formid-
able evils, fold their hands together, and declare that they arise
from causes over which they have no control! Nothing therefore
remains, they suggest, but to sit quietly till starvation has cleared
away the ?superabundant population,? when we shall again become
buoyant, and proceed on our course, until we again arrive at the
same point; as we inevitably must, if the like causes are permitted
to continue in operation. It is in the power of the labouring classes,
however, to save us from the recurrence of these horrible calamities.
They want only knowledge and intelligence to direct that power, and
then the world will bless them as its saviour! Do they doubt it!
We will ask them one question. Suppose that all the money in the
kingdom were removed to-morrow ?were swallowed up in the sea ?
would that dry up the resources of the country, or put an end to the
creation of wealth ! Put the question in this way to a man, and he
at once sees the absurdity of the supposition; but it is, nevertheless,
the notion blindly entertained by men generally. Seeing that the
productive powers of society are always put in motion (under the
existing states of things) by money, they have erroneously concluded
that money is the true and only power of production; and all their
views, therefore, and all their ideas of advantage to society, have
reference and are confined to the accumulation of money. This
notion is the gangrene that is destroying us; and yet its malignity
is so apparent, upon the slightest inspection, that it is astonishing it
should be permitted for an hour longer to distress us.


OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.
? Mr. Gresham says in his preface, with much force and no little truth, that
? the recent ventilation of the land question in the Imperial Parliament has
produced in the journals and periodicals such a searching criticism of the
basis of the tenure of land generally, as appears to warrant the conclusion
that further and fundamental changes are imminent.? ? ? Melbourne Daily
Telegraph, 6th December, 1870.
? In conjunction with many of the leading minds of the day, he holds
that the State should be the sole landlord.?? Age, sth December, 1870.
? Mr. Gresham holds with certain advanced thinkers in England, that all
private property in land is inequitable, and that the State should be the sole
landlord. Mr. Spencer?s chapter on the subject is closely argued, and is
well worthy of perusal. The principle put forward is totally opposed to
the land legislation of Victoria in recent years, but it has largely influenced
public opinion at home on the Irish land question.?? Warrnambool Ex-
aminer, 13th December, 1870.
? The object of the brochure is explained to be for the purpose of initiat-
ing an agitation against the alienation of land by the State and the adop-
tion of a system of thirty years? leases only. There is no doubt that the
subject is one of great importance, as affecting the welfare not only of the
present but all future generations, and merits the careful consideration of
our statesmen. The practical difficulties in the way of an embodiment of
his theory are fully acknowledged by the author, who, however, insists that
they are not insuperable, and that the change, being demanded by justice
and in the interest of society, ought to be brought about as speedily as
possible. The pamphlet is a logical and interesting statement of the ques-
tion, and will well repay perusal.?? dunes Guardian, 14th December, 1870.
? It forms Tract No. 1 of the Land Reform League, and is well calculated
to be of service as a contribution towards the settlement of the land ques-
tion on an equitable and permanent basis. We commend it to the attentive
consideration of our readers, and to place it within their reach we purpose
reprinting it in the columns of the Times. An instalment of it appears
in our present issue. The views advocated are provoking very general
attention, and commanding very extensive approval.?? Western Times,
15th December, 1870.
? Alienation, he argues, is opposed to the laws of political economy; unwise
and unjust; and the colonial application and experiences of the unjust
principle he promises in the series will be vividly described, showing not
only the present and past losses to the State, but indicating the future
certainty of distress and poverty in the colonies ?merely incipient hitherto,
but such as has in the extreme case of Irish landlordism been the death-blow
of the country. Mr. Gresham, in fact, is an uncomprising advocate of a
State landlord, who shall hold the land in trust that the cultivators shall
have cheap lands for ever, with the concurrent comfort and independence.
An equitable tenant-right to improvements will be part of the attending
benefits.? ? Portland Guardian, 19th December, 1870.
