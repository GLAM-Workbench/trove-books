XXVI. Notes on the Natural History and Habits of the Ornithorhynchus paradoxus,
Blum. By GEORGE BENNETT, Esq., F.L.S., Corr. Memb. Z.S.
Communicated May 27, 1834.
In the commencement of the year 1829, when I first arrived in the Colony of New
South Wales, my attention was directed towards two points of Natural Science which
were at that time desiderata—one the mode of generation of the Kangaroo, to explain
in what manner the young are brought into connexion with the nipple—and the other
the mode of generation and habits of the animal which forms the subject of the present
communication.
To all the inquiries I made of persons long resident in the Colony, I could only pro-
cure very unsatisfactory replies. I found then, as I also found on my subsequent and
second visit to the Colony, that the majority preferred forming theories of their own
and arguing on their plausibility, to devoting a few leisure days to the collection of facts
by which the questions might be set at rest for ever. At this time a voyage of great
interest to me, among the Islands of the Polynesian Archipelago and to New Zealand,
prevented my devoting the time which I had at first intended to employ in attempting
the discovery and elucidation of those doubtful points; and I left New South Wales in
March 1829, expecting that before my return to England some intelligent person resi-
dent in the Colony would devote himself to the task and determine them by actual
observation. On my return to England, however, in April 1831, I found that all the
questions relative to those animals still remained in the same undecided state, excepting
that my friend Mr. Owen had succeeded in injecting with mercury the ducts of the
supposed mammary glands of the Omithorhynchus; a communication on which subject,
as I have seen since leaving England in 1832, he has laid before the Royal Society.
I again left England for the Colony of New South Wales in May 1832, and soon
after my arrival there in August I visited the interior of the country, and devoted much
time to the investigation of the habits and oeconomy of these animals in their native
haunts.
The Omithorhynchus is known to the colonists by the name of Water-Mole, from
some resemblance which it is supposed to bear to the common European Mole, Talpa
Europeea, Linn.: by the native tribes at Bathurst and Goulburn Plains, and in the
Yas, Murrumbidgee, and Tumat countries, I universally found it designated by the
name of Mallangong or Tambreet; but the latter is more in use among them than the
former.
The body of this singular animal is depressed in form, and in some degree partakes

of the characters of the Otter, the Mole, and the Beaver. It is covered by a fine long and
thick hair, underneath which is a finer short very soft fur, resembling the two distinct
kinds of fur found in the Seal and Otter. On the abdomen, breast, and throat,.the fur and
hair are of a much finer quality, and of a more silky nature, than on the other parts of
the body of the animal. In young specimens the under surface of the tail, as well as
the hind and fore legs near the feet, is covered by a fine hair of a beautiful silvery white
appearance : this is lost, however, in the adult, in which the under surface of the tail
is almost entirely destitute of hair l . Whether this proceeds from its trailing along the
ground (which the close approximation of the abdomen and under surface of the tail to
the ground in all the movements of the animal on land makes very probable,) I know
not; but the most prevailing opinion among the colonists, for which, however, in the
observation of their habits, I could not discover any foundation in fact, was that it was
occasioned by the animals using the tail, in a manner similar to that which was for-
merly believed of the Beaver, as a trowel in the construction of its dwelling. The tail
is flat, broad, and inclining on each side abruptly off at the termination, beyond which
the long hairs project: on its upper surface the hair is longer and coarser than on any
other part of the body; it is destitute of that peculiar glossy appearance which adds
so much to the beauty of the fur generally, and is also of a darker colour. The colour
of the fur of the animal in all the specimens I have seen, of whatever age, is a light black,
varying in shades according as it is seen in a stronger or weaker light: the under
short fur is greyish. The whole of the under surface of the body is of a ferruginous
colour, varying in its intensity according to the age of the specimens. Ido not regard
this difference as any distinguishing mark of sex, as was at first supposed. Imme-
diately below the inner angle of the eye is a small spot of a light or pale yellow
colour. This I have remarked in all the specimens of either sex that I have seen, ex-
cepting in one which was captured on the banks of the Wollondilly River near Goulburn
Plains, in which these marks were deficient, although it did not differ in other external
appearances from the specimens I had before examined.
Ihe only external difference of sex to be accurately distinguished, and indeed the
only one on which any dependence can be placed, is the spur or claw on the hind leg
of the males ; the females being destitute of that appendage.
The legs of these animals are very short; the feet are pentadactyle and webbed. In
the fore feet (which seem to have the greatest muscular power, and are in principal use
both for burrowing and swimming,) the web extends a short distance beyond the claws,
is loose, and falls back when the animal burrows: the fore feet are thus capable of
1 The under surface of the tail, both in males and females, is sometimes bare; and sometimes has only a
few coarse hairs scattered over it.
2 I have heard that an Albino specimen of this animal was once seen; it was stated to have been close to
the water s edge at the time it was noticed, and to have been perfectly white. On the approach of the person
who observed it, it dived, and although watched did not reappear.


great expansion. The claws on the fore feet are strong, blunt, and well calculated for
burrowing ; and the two lateral are shorter than the three middle ones. The hind feet
are short, narrow, turned backwards, and when the animal is at rest have, like those
of the Seal, some resemblance to a fin; their action is backwards and outwards. The
first toe is very short, and the nails of all are curved backwards, and are longer and
sharper than those of the fore feet; the web does not extend further than the roots of
the claws. The spur of the male is moveable, and is turned backwards and inwards : it
is situated some distance above the claws, and rather towards the internal part of the leg.
The head is rather flat; and from the mouth project two flat lips or mandibles, re-
sembling the beak of a Shoveller Duck, the lower of which is shorter and narrower
than the upper, and has its internal edges channelled with numerous strias, resembling
in some degree those seen in the bill of a Duck. The central portion of the mandibles
is a bony continuation from the skull, and anteriorly and laterally a cartilaginous
substance, perfectly moveable, extends from the bony portion to the distance of 4ths
of an inch. The colour of the superior mandible above, when seen in an animal
recently taken out of the water, is of a dull dirty greyish black, covered wdth innu-
merable minute dots; while the cartilaginous expansion around the mandible is uni-
formly smooth and soft. The under part of the upper mandible is of a pale pink or
flesh colour, as well as the internal or upper surface of the lower mandible, the under
surface of which is either perfectly white or mottled: in younger specimens it is usually
white, while in the older it assumes a mottled appearance.
At the base of both the lower and upper mandibles is a transverse loose fold or flap
of the integument, always similar in colour to the skin covering the mandibles, that
is to say, of a dull dirty greyish black in the upper, and white or mottled in the lower.
In the upper mandible this is continued very nearly to the eyes, and may perhaps afford
some protection to those organs when the animal is engaged in burrowing or seeking
its food in the mud. The upper fold or flap is continuous with another portion arising
from the lower mandible also at its base. Sir Everard Home l considers the apparent
use of these folds to be to prevent the beak from being pushed into the soft mud beyond
this part, which is so broad as completely to stop its further progress. From careful
observation of the actions of living specimens I can, however, assign no other use to
this part than that which I have just mentioned. In dried specimens the colour and
form of the beak are almost entirely lost.
The eyes are very small, but brilliant, and of a light brown colour: they are situated
rather high up the head. The external orifice of the ears is situated near the upper
part of the external angle of the eye. When a living specimen is examined the
orifice 2 is easily discoverable, as the animal has the faculty of closing or opening it at
1 Observations on the Head of the Ornithorhynchus paradoxus, in the ‘ Philosophical Transactions’ for 1800.
* I could not perceive any valve corresponding to that which is usually possessed by animals that frequent
the water, but believe that the muscular contraction of the orifice answers the same purpose.

will: in dead specimens, being closed, it would not be readily perceived by a person
unacquainted with its exact situation. From this orifice a semicircular cartilaginous
canal is continued, terminating at the base of the skull.
The Omithorhynchus has a peculiar fishy smell, more especially when wet, which
probably proceeds from an oily secretion. The aborigines use these animals as food:
but it is no particular recommendation of them to say that they are eaten by the Native
Australian, as nothing in the shape of provender comes amiss to him, whether it
be snakes, rats, frogs, grubs, or the more delicate Opossum, Bandicoot and Flying
Squirrel.
There are two species usually described in our works on Natural History, the Orni-
thorhynchus rufus and the Orn. fuscus ; but the differences between them appear to me
to be so unimportant that I hesitate in considering them as otherwise than specifically
identical. Not having referred the Water-Moles which fell under my observation to
either of these presumed species, I retain for them the name originally proposed by
Professor Blumenbach, that of Orn. paradoxus : though subsequent in date to the de-
nomination assigned by Shaw to the same animal, it has been so extensively adopted as
to render it inexpedient in this instance to adhere to the strict rule of nomenclature.
The size of the Omithorhynchus varies, but the males are usually found to be in a
small degree larger than the females : the average length I consider to be from 1 foot
6 inches to 1 foot 8 inches. From the following dimensions of specimens shot in the
Yas and Murrumbidgee rivers l an idea may be formed of the relative proportions ot
the different parts to the body: the measurements were taken immediately after the
animals had been shot and removed from the water, the specimens, still in their flaccid
state, being placed in their natural position. On the dimensions thus taken more de-
pendence can be placed for accuracy than on those derived from stuffed specimens,
which, from the contracted state of most of the parts, and the artificial elongation given
to the body, cannot be relied on. As the integuments, moreover, hang very loose
about the animal, they are usually distended by the stuffier to a much greater degree
than is natural.
1 Mr. George MacLeay informs me that the specimens procured from the Nepean River are seldom longer
than 1 foot 2 inches.

this specimen appear different from all the others that I had seen ; but in other respects
it was similar to them. A female shot in the evening of the same day, and in the
same part of the river, measured only 1 foot 4 inches, as follows :
On the 17th of September 1832 I took my departure from Raby Farm in company
with Mr. Henry O’Brien, who was proceeding to his farm in the Yas country. Having
made a very interesting journey through the Bathurst country, we arrived, on the 4th
of October, at Mundoona, the estate of Mr. James Rose, near Yas Plains in the
Murray County. It was at this place that I had determined to commence my investi-
gations of the Omithorhynchus, as a portion of the Yas River ran through the estate,
in which these animals were to be found in great numbers.
We arrived at the Farm at 5 p.m. ; and as the river was but a very short distance
from the dwelling-house and I was eager to have even a distant view of the animal in
a living state, I readily acceded to an offer to walk on the banks w'hilst refreshment
was preparing for us after our long journey, and ascertain if one could be procured
that evening. We soon came to a tranquil part of the river, such as the colonists call
a “pond,” on the surface of which numerous aquatic plants grew. It is in places
of this description that the Water-Moles are most commonly seen, seeking their food
among the aquatic plants, whilst the steep and shaded banks afford them excellent
situations for excavating their burrows. We remained stationary on the banks, with
gun in rest, waiting their appearance with some degree of patience; and it was not
long before my companion quietly directed my attention to one of these animals
paddling on the surface of the water, not far distant from the bank on which we were
then standing. In such circumstances they may be readily recognised by their dark
bodies just seen level with the surface, above which the head is slightly raised, and by
the circles made in the water around them by their paddling action. On seeing them
the spectator must remain perfectly stationary, as the slightest noise or movement of
his body would cause their instant disappearance, so acute are they in sight or hear-
ing, or perhaps in both; and they seldom reappear when they have been frightened.
By remaining perfectly quiet when the animal is “up,” the spectator is enabled to
obtain an excellent view of its movements on the water ; it seldom, however, remains


longer than one or two minutes playing and paddling on the surface, soon diving again
and reappearing a short distance above or below, generally according to the direction in
which it dives. It dives head foremost with an audible splash.
Although the animal may “ come up” close to the place where the sportsman is
standing, it would be useless to attempt to level the gun, for that action alone would
cause its instantaneous disappearance; but after waiting patiently until the animal
dives, and watching the direction in which it sinks preparation must be made to re-
ceive it with the discharge of the piece instantly on its reappearance on the surface,
which (when it descends unfrightened) is almost certain to take place in a short time.
A near shot is requisite, a distant one being almost hopeless ; and the aim should be in-
variably directed at the head, in which spot the shots are more likely to take speedy
effect than in the loose dense integuments of the body, which, as they afford little
resistance, the shot are unable to penetrate. I have seen the skull shattered by the
force of the shot when the integuments covering it have scarcely suffered injury.
Although the following day was very showery, this did not deter us from ranging the
banks of the river in quest of Ornithorhynchi. The heavy rain in the course of the
night and morning had swollen the stream considerably, and we saw only one specimen
during the morning, which proved too vigilant for us, and consequently escaped. In
our return home, however, along the banks, about 2 p.m., at a narrow part of the river,
one of these animals was seen paddling about on the surface. We waited until it dived,
which it did soon afterwards ; and having made our preparation, on its returning to
the surface of the water, a short distance further down, it received the contents of the
gun, which took effect; for although it immediately sank, it soon came up again, evi-
dently severely wounded. It evaded capture by frequently diving, although in its
wounded condition it was soon obliged to regain the surface of the water, and was evi-
dently striving to reach the opposite bank 2: it moved tardily, with the greatest part
of the body above the surface of the water, as is usually observed in these animals
when they are severely hurt. It received, however, two effective discharges from the
fowling-piece before it remained tranquil on the water and allowed the dog to bring it
out. It proved to be a fine male specimen, and was not yet dead, but moved occa-
sionally, making no noise except frequent deep expirations from the nostrils.
When the fur of the animal is wet, it has a sordid and far from attractive appear-
ance, resembling rather a lump of dirty weeds than any production of the animal king-
dom. Indeed, were it not for their paddling motion on the water, these animals would
1 If the water is very clear, the course of the animal beneath its surface after diving can be distinctly seen ;
but as the places frequented by it usually abound in river-weeds, it seldom occurs that it is noticed in a
clear part of the river. On diving, they never rise again at the same place ; but it is not difficult, with a little
experience in sporting for these animals, to judge with tolerable accuracy where they may again rise, so as
to obtain a mark at them.
9 When wounded, they make for the land, either to escape into their burrows, or from being unable to
support themselves in their weakened condition on the water.

often escape observation; for their suppleness and colour when wet, would cause them
to be regarded only as masses of weeds, such as are so often seen floating about the
rivers. Such at least was their appearance when lying dead on the surface of the water,
or when drifted by the current against the stump of a tree, or among the reeds and
bullrushes which grow so profusely near and upon the banks.
A few minutes after the animal had been taken out of the water it revived and ran
along the ground, instinctively endeavouring to regain the water, but with an unsteady
motion. In about twenty-five minutes from the time of its capture, it gave a few con-
vulsive sighs and expired.
This specimen being a male, and having heard so much related about the injurious
effects resulting from a puncture by the spur, I determined to avail myself of the op-
portunity to ascertain the correctness of the assertion. The wounded state of the
animal presented no objection to the experiment, as in one published account in which
the poison is reported to have produced such terrible effects, the animal was also mor-
tally wounded. As soon, therefore, as it became lively, I put its “ poisonous spurs” to
the test. I commenced by placing my hands in such a manner, when seizing the animal,
as to enable it, from the direction of the spurs, to use them with effect: the result was
that the animal made strenuous efforts to escape, and in these efforts scratched my hands
a little with the hind claws, and even, in consequence of the position in which I held it,
with the spur also. But although seized so roughly, it neither darted the spur into my
hand, nor did it even make an attempt so to do. As, however, it had been stated that
the creature throws itself on the back when it uses this weapon 1 , (a circumstance not
very probable to those who have any knowledge of the animal,) I tried it also in that
position ; but though it struggled to regain its former posture, no use was made of the
hind claw. I tried several other methods of effecting the object I had in view, but as
all proved futile, I am convinced that some other use must be found for the spur than
as an offensive weapon. I have had several subsequent opportunities of repeating
the experiments with animals not in a wounded state, and the results have been the
same.
These animals are seen in the Australian rivers at all seasons of the year, but a
question may arise whether they do not in some degree hybernate, for they are more
abundant during the summer than in the winter months. During floods or freshes
it is, however, not an uncommon occurrence to see them travelling up and down the
rivers. When going down, they allow themselves to be carried along by the force
of the stream, without making any exertion of their own ; but when swimming against
the stream, all their muscular power is exerted to the utmost to stem the force
1 Some of the settlers consider the spur of the Omithorhynchus as poisonous, not from any experience of
their own, but in consequence of the aborigines saying, alluding to the spur, “ It is very saucysuch being
their English expression when they wish to imply that anything is hurtful or poisonous : they apply, however,
the same expression to the scratching of the hind feet of the animal. It is also certain that they never seem
afraid of handling in any way the male Omithorhynchus alive.


of the current, and it is generally done effectively. I recollect, however, seeing two
making repeated and ineffectual attempts to pass a small waterfall during a rapid
current of the river, and after many persevering efforts they were unable to attain their
object.
The opinion that I had heard advanced at Sidney, of its being requisite to shoot the
Water-Moles dead instantly, otherwise they would sink and not reappear, I did not find
to be correct in practice. If missed, indeed, this is likely to occur; but if the animal
is wounded, it immediately sinks, but soon reappears on the surface of the water some
distance beyond the place at which it was seen to dive. Some require two or three
shots before they are killed or so severely wounded as to enable them to be brought
out of the water; and they frequently evade being captured, even when wounded, by
frequent and rapid diving. Sometimes too, unless the sportsman is very vigilant, they
may come up among the reeds and rushes, which are plentiful in some parts, extending
out from the banks of the river, and thus escape observation altogether. I have no
doubt, also, that some which sink after being wounded, escape into their burrows ; as
even when they cannot reach the bank, they may get access to the hole by the sub-
aqueous entrance.
On the evening of the day on which the first specimen was shot, we were fortu-
nate in procuring a female. It was twice seen paddling about on the water, diving
and then rising again, but not sufficiently near to allow of its being fired at; the third
time it dived, rising within good aim, it was shot. On being taken out of the water it
bled from the mouth, and it was found that the shot had struck it about the base and
on other parts of the mandibles; it died almost immediately. The only indications of
vitality which it gave consisted of a gasping motion of the mandibles and a convulsive
action of the hind feet, as when the animal combs the sides of the abdomen with the
claws of the hind feet. This specimen differed from the last in the abdomen being of a
much darker ferruginous colour ; but from subsequent observations of numerous spe-
cimens, I find these differences to depend merely on the age of the animal. In this
individual the web of the fore feet was entirely black, but in many it is found mottled ;
the under mandible was nearly white, the upper of the usual colour. There was no
spur on the hind foot, but on the situation of it in the male, the female had a small
impervious depression, which it is not improbable may serve for the reception of the
spur of the male.
I felt great delight at having procured a female specimen, as I had some expecta-
tion of being able thereby to ascertain the mode of procreation in this most extraordi-
nary quadruped. At all events I expected to determine whether this was or was not
the commencement of the breeding-season among them. My attention was immediately
directed to the abdominal or mammary gland, and on laying aside the abdominal in-
teguments and examining its situation, I was at first rather surprised to observe scarcely
any appearance of it. On reflection, however, it occurred to me (a supposition which
2 i 2


was afterwards confirmed by facts,) that as the gestation advances, the gland becomes
enlarged; and that when the lacteal secretion is no longer required for the support of
the young, it again decreases, becoming scarcely perceptible.
Omitting the rest of the anatomy, I shall at once proceed to the result of the inves-
tigation of the uterine organs. These I found to consist of two uteri extending some
distance above the pelvis. On the upper, rather posterior and lateral part of the uteri
(but more particularly and more clearly marked in the left than in the right uterus,) were
well developed clusters of ova, giving an indication of an impregnated female. Both
uteri, gradually diminishing in size as they proceeded, had their termination in the
cloaca ; the bladder was situated between and rather anterior to the uteri, and the rectum
posterior to the bladder; and both these organs also had their termination in the cloaca.
The ovaries were white l , and covered by a semitransparent membrane, through which
the ova could be readily distinguished. The left uterus had the largest development:
its coats were thickened, and on laying the internal part open gradually from the os
uteri to the apex, three loose ova of the size of swan-shot were successively exposed to
view, one a short distance above the other, but all in the uterine cavity. They were
perfectly white and quite round; their external coat consisted of a dense opake mem-
brane ; and they could be taken into the hand and examined without fear of their sus-
taining any injury 2.
The os uteri was contracted so closely at this period as scarcely to permit a very thin
1 After having been preserved in spirits, they became rather of a yellowish colour : indeed the whole of the
preparation of the uterine organs had, as may be supposed, a far more beautiful appearance when viewed in
the recent state than after it had been for some time preserved in spirit. For such purposes I should prefer
brine to spirit, as the natural appearance of animal preparations is not so liable to be lost.
2 I took the earliest opportunity of transmitting to my friend Mr. Owen the impregnated uterus of this Or-
nithorhynchus, and of two others which I subsequently obtained, and the following is the result of his exami-
nation of these specimens as detailed in a paper just published by him in the ‘ Philosophical Transactions.’
“ In each of the specimens, the left ovary only had taken on the sexual actions, but did not exceed in size the
same parts in the unimpregnated specimens above described. The right ovary had, however, become enlarged;
it measured half an inch in length, a third of an inch in breadth, and was about half a line in thickness: a few
ovisacs, about the size of a small pin’s head, projected from the surface.
“ The left ovary in each of the specimens was concealed by the thin membrane forming the expanded orifice of
the oviduct. In one of these it was with some difficulty it could be withdrawn from the Fallopian aperture, owing
to the adhesion which was occasioned by what appeared to be a coagulated secretion; a circumstance which
must have effectually ensured the passage of the ovum into the oviduct. In two of the specimens, the left ovary
presented two empty ovisacs, or corpora lutea, corresponding with the number of ova found in the uterus. In
the third specimen, the left ovary presented two ovisacs still uncicatrized, but only one ovum was contained in
the uterus. * * * *
“ Tlie discharged ovisacs were of an elongated flask-shaped form, about three lines in length and two in
diameter, with the margins of the orifice through which the ovum and granular substance had passed everted,
with a slight contraction, resembling the neck of a flask, below the aperture. On compressing these ovisacs,
small portions of coagulated substance escaped. When longitudinally divided, they were found to consist of
the same parts as the ovisac before impregnation, with the exception of the granular contents and granular


stem of grass, not much larger in diameter than a hog’s bristle, to pass through it; just
within the orifice were two small raised reddish bodies, the use of which I do not know.
The interior coats of the uterus were corrugated and of a fine pinkish colour.
On laying open the right uterus, although it was also enlarged and had some degree
of vascularity, with ovaries on its upper part, no eggs were found within: internally
it had the same corrugated appearance as was observed in the left, but the vascular
tinge existed in a less degree.
The cheek-pouches, or, as I am inclined to consider them, the first stomachs, of both
stratum : but the theca, or innermost parieles of the sac, was much thickened, and encroached irregularly upon
the empty space, so as to leave only a cylindrical passage to the external opening. * * * *
“ The two smallest sized ova * * * were situated at the upper part of the left uterus, and at the distance of
about a line from each other. Each ovum was spherical in form, and measured two lines and a half in diameter:
they were of a deep yellow colour, with a smooth and polished surface, and had not the slightest adherence to
the uterine parieles.
“ The two ova next in size * * * measured each three lines in diameter, and were situated a little below the
middle of the left uterus: they were of a spherical form, hut had evidently been slightly compressed in the uterine
cavity. They were of a lighter colour than the preceding, a circumstance which was specially evident at the
upper part, from the subsidence of the contained vitelline mass. Externally they were smooth, and rolled
freely out of the position where they were lodged like those of the preceding specimen.
“ The largest ovum * * * had the same spherical form, smooth exterior surface, and freedom from connexion
with the uterus, as the preceding, but was of a much lighter colour, owing to the increased quantity of its fluid
contents, to which its greater size was chiefly attributable. It measured three lines and a half in diameter,
and had been situated in a depression or cell a little below the middle of the left uterus. The lining membrane
of the uterus was highly vascular in the recent state in each of the above specimens.
“ In all these ova the contents could be seen, through the cortical or outer membrane, to be of two kinds,
viz., a greyish subtransparent fluid and a yellowish denser mass, which varied in their relative proportions as
above mentioned, the denser substance always subsiding to the lowest part of the ovum, whichever way it was
turned. In the largest ovum, the yellow mass or yolk occupied about one third of its cavity, while in the small-
est it constituted four fifths of the whole mass.
“ The chorion or cortical membrane of these ova offered a moderate degree of resistance when torn open with
the forceps, and yielded equally in every direction when separated from the yolk, the rent margins curling in-
wards like the coats of a hydatid. This membrane was of a dull greyish colour inclining to brown, slightly trans-
parent, and more polished upon its inner than upon its outer surface : it resembles the cortical membrane of
the ovum of the Salamander, but is of a more delicate texture. The fluid contents occupied the space between
the cortical and vitelline membranes, a situation analogous to that of the albumen in the egg of the Fowl,
but had not become coagulated by the action of the spirit in which the ova had been so long immersed.
“ The yellow matter, or yolk, was seen to be invested by its proper capsule, which, when reflected under
the microscope, was found to consist of an extremely thin, smooth, and transparent outer layer, which I regard
as the membrana vitelli, with a thicker granular membrane immediately lining it, analogous to the blastoderma
or germinative membrane. The contents of the above investments, or substance of the yolk, consisted of innu-
merable minute opake granules, similar in size and regularity of form to those contained in the ovarian follicles,
and with these granules were mingled larger transparent globules of oil. There was not the slightest trace of
chalazte attached to the vitelline membrane, as, from analogy, we should expect to be the case had the ovum
been destined to have been perfected by incubation. I was unable to detect any rudiments of the embryo.”—
Philosophical Transactions for 1834, p. 555.


the animals were filled with mud and gravel, among which comminuted fragments of
insects and minute shell-fish could be plainly discovered.
The various contradictory accounts that have been given on the authority of the
aborigines (who may be supposed, from their so often seeking these animals for food,
to be able to state their habits correctly,) as to the animal laying eggs and hatching
them, induced me to take some pains to find out the cause of error; and being now
perfectly satisfied that ova were produced in the uteri, I could the more readily deter-
mine the accuracy or inaccuracy of the accounts which I might receive from the na-
tives. I determined, however, not to question any who had been repeatedly questioned
before on the same subject; but some time after, when I visited the out-stations in
the Tumat country, where such questions had never been previously asked, I made in-
quiries among the most intelligent.
The Yas natives in the first instance asserted that the animals lay eggs, but very
shortly afterwards contradicted themselves. To ascertain what dependence could be
placed on them, I made a drawing of an oval egg, which was recognised to be like that
of the Mallangong. I then made a drawing of a round egg, and that also was declared
to he cabango (egg) of the Mallangong. It was also declared that “ old woman have egg
there in so many days” (the number of which they did not know); that the young ones
“ tumble down”; and that two eggs are laid in one day. An account subsequently ob-
tained from a native, who appeared anxious to explain the fact, would lead to the belief
that the animal is ovoviviparous ; but yet, from the difficulty they find in expressing
themselves correctly in our language, we often misunderstand them. He asserted the
animal to be oviparous, but when desired to procure the eggs he replied, “ Bel cabango
(no egg) tumble down; bye bye, pickaninny tumble down.” In the Tumat country the
answers were readily and satisfactorily given; and afterwards more minute questions
being put to them through my interpreter, the result was the same. “ Tamhreet make
egg tumble down?” was the first query I made. “ Bel” (no) was the reply. “No
egg ( corbuccor ) tumble down; pickaninny make tumble down.” This accorded with
my observations, for it was at the season that this inquiry was made that the young
Duckbills hereafter noticed were found, as if just brought forth, in the burrow. The
natives are of course accurate in their observation of the breeding-season of animals,
upon which their principal means of sustenance in this country depend.
On showing one of the natives at Yas the preparation of the uteri, he recognised
them as the place “ where pickaninny is made.” When he saw the small eggs in the
uterus on the opposite side, (for the empty one was first shown him,) he first stared, and
then said, “ Cabango, cabango” (egg, egg) ; but even with this before him no satis-
factory reply could be procured from him whether the animal laid and hatched them.
On the whole we may infer that no dependence can be placed on native accounts, but
that naturalists must seek for information in their own investigations.
On the following day (6th of October) the Yas River was much swollen by the con


tinued rains; but although exposed to heavy drenching showers, we again visited the
river. A few of the Duckbills were to be seen occasionally, but none at this time
within shot, until about 2 p. m., when a male specimen was shot; the under mandible
and flap, and the web of the fore feet, were mottled as in the last specimen. On the
lower part of the spur two small leeches were attached, one of which was red and
swollen with the blood it had sucked from the animal; the other appeared to have just
attached itself. The undistended one was £ths of an inch in length, and of a dull black
colour. I may here remark that I could not discover any parasites among the short
thick fur of any of these animals.
When shot, this specimen was borne down by the rapidity of the stream of the river,
the current having been much increased by its swollen state. The animal, however, was
readily brought out by the expertness of a small spaniel dog (which seemed to enter
into the delight of the sport as much as ourselves), and after a few convulsive sighs
expired.
The testes in the first male specimen I examined were large, being nearly the size of
a pigeon’s egg, and were situated near the kidneys. The penis is concealed in a sheath
near the verge of the anus, so that unless pressure is made near the sheath, which
occasions the penis to be thrust out, that organ is not visible; and there is conse-
quently no external distinguishing mark of the difference of sex in these animals, ex-
cepting the spur on the hind feet of the males. In the last male specimen shot the
testes were not larger than a very small pea. Does the difference of size depend on the
breeding-season ? or rather, How is the difference at the same season of the year to be
explained ? In a male specimen shot at the Murrumbidgee the testes were also not
larger than very small peas. Thus out of three males the testes were only found large
in the specimen shot on the sth of October.
At 5 p. m. of the evening of the same day (6th of October) another female specimen
was shot; on being brought out of the water it merely gave a few convulsive motions
of the hind feet before it expired.
Another specimen was soon afterwards seen, a short distance lower down the river,
dabbling on the surface of the stream in apparent enjoyment of the cool evening. One
discharge laid it motionless on the surface of the water, and the dog immediately
brought it out. This proved, much to my satisfaction, to be another female. At
first it lay quite motionless as if dead; but soon after, on the way home, it showed
symptoms of vitality, and on placing it on the ground, it walked with tolerable rapidity
instinctively towards the river. This specimen died, however, soon after it was taken
home.
On examining the first specimen that had been shot this evening, I found the uteri
enlarged, more particularly that of the left side, above which a distinct cluster of ova
were seen as in the former specimen; they were covered by a delicate membrane l .
1 This is the expanded end of the Fallopian tube.


On laying open the left uterus it was found to contain two unattached ova, of a white
colour, and of transparent appearance while left in the moisture of the uterus, but which
became opake when dry : being covered by a dense membrane they could be handled
and examined without any fear of injury. The parietes of the right uterus were also
much distended and thickened, but on an examination of its interior it was found not
to contain any eggs.
In the second female shot this evening the left uterus was more distended than in the
former specimens, and in the usual situation a fine cluster of ova, covered by a thin
pellicle, was seen. The right uterus w 7 as much smaller, hardly appearing to be at all
distended, and was destitute of ova. On laying open the left uterus it was found to
contain a single ovum of the size of a buck-shot.
The next morning (October 7), at Mr. Manton’s farm, I accompanied one of the
aborigines called Daraga to the banks of the Yas River, to see the burrow of an Orni-
thorhynchus, from which he told me the young had been taken last summer. I asked
him, “ What for he dig up Mallangong ?” “ Murry budgeree patta” (very good to eat),
was his reply. On arriving at the spot, which was situated on a steep bank about
which long grass and various other herbaceous plants abounded, and close to the river,
my guide, putting aside the long grass, displayed the entrance of the burrow, distant
rather more than a foot from the water’s edge. In digging up this retreat the natives
had not laid it entirely open, but had delved holes at certain distances, always intro-
ducing a stick for the purpose of ascertaining the direction in which the burrow ran,
previously to again digging down upon it. By this method they were enabled to ex-
plore the whole extent of it with less labour than if it had been laid entirely open. The
termination of the burrow was broader than any other part, nearly oval in form, and
the bottom was strewed with dry river weeds, &c., a quantity of which still remained.
From this place our sable friend said he had taken last season (December) three young
ones, which were about 6or 8 inches long, and covered with hair. The whole of the
burrow was smooth, extending about 20 feet in a serpentine direction up the bank.
I may here mention, that when a half-civilized young savage accompanied me one
day in a search after Water-Moles' burrows, he expressly cautioned me against putting
my hand into the burrow : “No put hand in, for he make smell hand.” The burrows
have one entrance, usually about the distance of a foot from the water’s edge, and an-
other under the water, communicating with the interior by an opening just within the
upper entrance. It is no doubt by this entrance under the water that the animal seeks
refuge within its burrow when it is seen to dive and not to rise again to the surface ;
and when the poor hunted quadruped is unable to enter or escape from the burrow by
the upper aperture, it makes a second effort by its river entrance.
The search for a second burrow near the first afforded me an opportunity of witnessing
the means the aborigines adopt to track these animals. Our black zoological collector
pointed out to me in the course of his peripatetic lecture, or rather demonstration of


the whole art of capturing them, the distinct marks of the hind and fore feet of one
of these animals on the moist clay near the river; and afterwards inserting his hand up
the burrow, brought from thence some lumps of clay taken from the under surface.
These he regarded closely, and placing them in my hands pointed out recent impres-
sions of the fore feet of one of the Mallangong tribe, which were certainly distinctly
visible. He then removed some other pieces from the interior of the burrow, on which
there were further proof impressions of the animal’s recent presence, and it was there-
fore declared to be an inhabited one. I was anxious to explore it, but as Daraga said
that no “ pickaninnies ” (eggs were not mentioned by him) would be found therein,
nor “ old women” either, I was overruled: indeed as respected the first, I was aware
by the recent dissection of specimens that no young would be found at this early pe-
riod of the season, and I depended on native accuracy for the living one not being in
the burrow. This I afterwards regretted, for I subsequently procured a living female
specimen by not relying on similar information given by the same native; and some
time after, on exploring this burrow, I found it forsaken, the old one either having been
killed or having deserted her habitation.
Returning early in the evening from Mr. Manton’s, there was time to visit the banks
of the Yas River at Mundoona; and at 6 p.m. a female was seen and fired at, which
laid it tranquil as if dead on the surface of the water. When brought out, however, it
was found not to be quite dead ; and in a few minutes afterwards it revived, although
severely w'ounded. By the time we had reached the house, the animal had become
more recovered, ran rapidly (with a sidelong motion, on account of its wounded side,)
about the room, and dashing in its passage through the burning wood fire, got much
singed, but was not otherwise injured. It was extremely restless, and ran round and
round the room, seeking some crevice from which it might escape: from the power
which the animal possesses, by means of strong cutaneous muscles, to contract its loose
integuments as well as its body, it can pass out of an aperture which, to a person igno-
rant of these circumstances, it would appear impossible for it to force itself through.
When I took it into my hand, it made strenuous efforts to escape from my grasp;
and from the flaccid nature of its skin, I found some difficulty in retaining it; but it
made no attempt to bite or otherwise inflict injury: indeed, its weak mandibles would
be useless for such a purpose. As the animal was so very restless, I tied it up by a
string attached to the hind-leg; but it still renewed the efforts to escape from its place
of confinement, scratching very violently until it became exhausted, expelling air from
the nostrils, and uttering also a faint moaning noise, which excited our pity. When
I placed it in a bucket of water, it sank, but immediately afterwards came to the sur-
face, expelling air from the nostrils : it appeared evident, that in its wounded condition
it was unable to support itself in the water; and in about two minutes, on taking it
out, it was quite exhausted, and did not again move for several minutes. It died in the
course of the night.
vol. i. 2 k


On examining the uterine organs of this specimen on the following morning, I found
the right uterus distended, and measuring 2f inches in length; but on laying open its
interior it was found not to contain any ova. The left uterus was vascular; and on
laying open the interior, the inner surface was found thickened, corrugated, and vas-
cular ; at the loose part I found two white semi-transparent ova, about the size of, or
rather smaller than, buck-shot. They lay perfectly unattached to the uterus, and readily
came out. On placing them on my hand, and then holding them up to the light, I
could distinctly perceive a yelk of a very pale yellow colour, which, in whatever direc-
tion I turned the ovum, fell to the under surface. After the ova had been taken out of
the uterus, and the moisture which covered them at that time had become dried up,
they lost their semi-transparent appearance, and became opake ; but being replaced in
the moist uterus they soon regained their former appearance. Like all those which I
had previously seen they had a firm tough external membrane, which enabled them to
be handled and examined without injury to their structure. A cluster of ova was situ-
ated in the usual place over each uterus in this specimen.
In all the females that I had now dissected, I had experienced much difficulty in
finding the abdominal or mammary glands: indeed, had I not been previously acquainted
with their situation, I should, in their present stage, have passed them over altogether.
On one occasion a native was overlooking me when busily engaged in seeking for the
gland. Perfectly aware, although I had not informed him, for what I sought, he pointed
out its situation, saying at the same time, “ Milliken (milk) come all same as from cow.”
When I told him that I could hardly see it, he replied, “ Bye and bye, when pickaninny
come, cobbong (large), milliken come.”
On the afternoon of this day (October Bth) the usual ramble was taken on the banks,
to observe and procure specimens of these animals. As the native Daraga came from
Mr. Manton’s to Mundoona this afternoon, he accompanied us, and we availed ourselves
of the opportunity to obtain his assistance in seeking for burrows. On a steep bank at
one part of the river, the keen-sighted native pointed out to our uninitiated eyes the
tracks of these animals on the moist earth close to the water; which tracks being fol-
lowed up the bank at a distance varying from two to five feet, the entrance of the bur-
row, concealed by the long grass and shrubs, was soon discovered, and the tracks had
evidently a very recent appearance. Following the same method as he had adopted
when the last burrow was discovered, the native placed his hand within it, and took
from its lower surface pieces of clay on which impressions of the animal’s feet were
distinctly marked; but from the situation of these burrows I regarded it as next to im-
possible to explore them. We had often during this excursion mistaken the holes of
water-rats and other animals for those of the Ornithorhynchus ; but our tawny com-
panion always told us to what animal they belonged, at the same time readily pointing
out the differences.
Very late in the evening we watched two Water-Moles paddling about in a small pond


of the river; but they eluded all the endeavours made to get a sufficiently near shot.
I repeatedly heard a splash in the water at one particular part of the bank whenever I
approached it, as if the animals had retreated to the land, but, unable to gain their
burrow in time, had, on my approach, taken again to the water. As this occurred often
about the same place, and as darkness was setting in rapidly, I marked the situation of
the spot, and determined to examine it on the following day, and ascertain whether
I was correct in my supposition.
Our tawny friend Daraga remarked to me that it was of no use digging up burrows 1
of Water-Moles now for “pickaninny”, for “ none yet tumble down from mother”; but
that further in the summer season, in rather “ more than one moon, plenty pickaninny
tumble down from old woman.” It puzzled him, however, to form a conjecture w T hy,
with such abundance of cattle, sheep, &c., we wanted Mallangongs.
On examining the cheek-pouches or the stomachs of these animals, I always ob-
served the food to consist of river insects, very small shell-fish, &c., which were con-
stantly found comminuted and mingled with mud or gravel: this latter might be re-
quired to aid digestion, as I never observed the food unmingled with it. The natives
say that they also feed on river-weeds ; but as I have never seen any of that descrip-
tion of food in their pouches, I cannot confirm the correctness of the statement 2 . The
young are fed at first by milk, and afterwards, when sufficiently old, by insects, &c.,
mingled with mud. “ All same you white feller,” said one of the blacks to me one
day, when I asked him on what the young moles were fed by the “ old women”;
“ first have milliken, then make patta (eat) bread, yam,” &c.
On the following morning, whilst the horses were saddling for a ride to Mount La-
vinia, the farm and residence of Mr. O’Brien, on Yas Plains, we went down, accom-
panied by the native Daraga, to that part of the river at which I had supposed the
Water-Mole to have been attempting to escape into its burrow. I was right in my
conjecture, for near the spot tracks of one of these animals were very distinctly visible,
and we traced them up the bank, where, amongst some long grass, the entrance was
discovered; and further tracks having been discovered on the under surface of the in-
terior, there was sufficient to determine its being an inhabited burrow; an opinion to
which our black companion Daraga assented. The situation was one admirably calcu-
lated for digging, as the bank gradually sloped, and was neither very high nor steep ;
so I came to the determination to explore it. This was done, not with the expectation
of meeting with any young, for my dissected specimens induced a contrary opinion, but
from a desire of examining the internal construction of the burrows formed by these
1 The name by which the natives express the burrow or habitation of any animal is guniar ; and the same
word is applied to our houses, being our habitations.
4 Mr. George MacLeay informed me that he had shot some, in a part of the Wollondilly River, having river-
weeds in their pouches; but he further observed that in that part of the river aquatic insects were very
scarce.

animals. Spades were consequently sent for; but when our sable friend Daraga heard
the word “digging” pronounced, his countenance exhibited anything but a gleam of
satisfaction, for he had evidently a strong aversion to work of that kind ; and think-
ing that in the natural course of events, being black, a greater share of the labour
would fall upon him than upon us who were “ white fellers,” he endeavoured to creep
out of the scrape by declaring the burrow an old one and not worth examining.
Being now, however, perfectly satisfied that it was an inhabited burrow, in a place to
be dug up with more facility than any I had yet seen, I was not to be deterred from
my purpose. Seeing that my resolution was not to be set aside by the force of his
eloquence, Daraga sat down at a short distance from the scene of operation, con-
soling himself with a pipe of tobacco. When, however, he found that the operation of
digging was not to be confined to himself, he came and assisted in the exploration by
passing a stick up the burrow, in order to ascertain its direction. The entrance of the
burrow was large, particularly when compared with the width of the passage continued
from it, measuring one foot three inches in depth, and one foot one inch in breadth.
Instead of laying the burrow entirely open from the entrance to the termination, which
would have been a laborious undertaking, holes were opened at certain distances in the
direction of the burrow, according to the method adopted by the aborigines. The na-
tive Daraga assisted us by digging also with a sharp-pointed stick, and he was able to
effect his object with much greater rapidity by it than we with our spades.
The burrow became narrower as it receded from the entrance, being about the usual
breadth of the animal when uncontracted. After having traced it for the distance of
ten feet four inches, and having just delved down upon it so as to perceive it still con-
tinuing its course up the bank, the beak and head of a Water-Mole were seen pro-
truding for an instant from the upper part, as if it had been disturbed from its repose,
and had come down to see what we were about with its habitation. It only remained
for an instant; for as soon as it beheld us, imagining no doubt that we could be there
making such a noise for no very benevolent purpose, it immediately turned up to
take refuge in that part of the burrow which yet remained unexplored. In turning
round, however, it was seized by the hind leg and dragged out. The animal appeared
very much alarmed when it was hauled out of its subterraneous dwelling: it discharged
its urine (which had rather a strong odour) and its faces when first caught, which I
attribute to fear, for this is not usual with other living specimens that I have since seen.
It uttered no sound, nor did it attempt to bite ; and proved to be a full-grown female.
When I held the unfortunate Platypus in my hands, its bright little eyes glistened, and
the orifices of the ears were expanded and contracted alternately, as if eager to catch
the slightest sound, while its heart palpitated violently with fear and anxiety. After it
had been retained in the hands for some time and had lost its first fear, although
it occasionally struggled to escape, it seemed to become more reconciled to its situa-
tion.


The Ornithorhynchus which I had thus succeeded in obtaining alive and uninjured,
was placed in a cask, with grass, mud (taken from the river), and water, and every-
thing that could make it comfortable under existing circumstances. It ran round its
place of confinement, scratching and making great efforts to get out; but finding them
useless, it became quite tranquil, contracted itself into a small compass, and soon
became buried in sleep. At night, however, it was very restless, and made great efforts
to escape, going round the cask with its fore paws raised against the sides, and the webs
thrown back, and scratching violently with the claws of the fore feet, as if to burrow
its way out. In the morning I found the animal fast asleep, the tail being turned in-
wards, the head and beak under the breast, and the body contracted into a very small
compass : sometimes, however, its position when asleep is with the tail as usual turned
inwards, the body contracted, and the beak protruding. The animal uttered, when
disturbed from its sleep, a noise something like the growl of a puppy, but perhaps in a
softer and more harmonious key. Although quiet for the greater part of the day, it
made efforts to escape and uttered a growling noise during the night.
I found, by measurement, that the distance of the entrance of this burrow from the
water’s edge was five feet: it was on a moderately steep bank, abounding with long
wiry grass and shrubs, among which, and concealed by them, was the opening of the
subterranean dwelling. From the judgment which I have been enabled to form from
the examination of this, as well as of several other burrows of these animals, I do not
imagine that the natives have ever seen, or that any one could see, (except in a state of
confinement,) the young ones in the act of sucking the mother; for in the tedious pro-
cess of digging their habitations, the old animal is disturbed, and either endeavours to
escape, or actually succeeds in escaping, long before the termination of the burrow is
attained. I could not observe any heaps of earth near the burrow, nor can I form any
opinion how in the process of excavation the animal disposes of the loose mould. May
we be permitted to suppose that the animal carries away the earth collected during the
excavation, in order that the heap which would otherwise be formed may not point out
the situation of the burrow ? A similar instinct is found among several insects, as in
the Mason Wasp and Carpenter Bee; and why not in this animal?
This burrow ran up the bank in a serpentine course, approaching nearer to the surface
of the earth towards its termination, at which part the nest is situated. This is suffi-
ciently large to accommodate the old animal and its young. No nest had yet been made
in the termination of this burrow, for that appears to be formed about the time of bring-
ing forth the young, and consists merely of dried grass, weeds, &c., strewed over the floor
of this part of the habitation. The termination was of the form shown in the following
sketch, and measured one foot in length by six inches in breadth. The whole extent of
the burrow, from the entrance to the termination, I found by actual measurement to be
twenty feet. The burrows are situated above the usual river height, but do not appear
to be above the extensive floods of the river which frequently take place during the


winter season. The accompanying sketch of the burrow and locality conveys some idea
of their appearance as well as situation.
On my return, after an absence of two days at the Murrumbidgee, I found my living
specimen well, it having been kept confined during that time in the cask, which formed
a very safe prison. I had now determined to leave this part of the country for Sidney,
to forward to England the preparations of the animal which I had already made ; and
believing that this specimen, if it survived the journey, and proved to have been im-
pregnated, would determine whether the animal was or was not ovoviviparous, on
the 13th of October I took my departure, carrying it with me in a small box, with
grass, &c., which was covered by battens, having very narrow spaces left between.
On disturbing it, it being at the time asleep, to place it in the travelling-box, it
uttered several savage growls. It arrived safely on the 14th at Lansdown Park,
the estate of Mr. Bradley. Here I availed myself of the vicinity of some ponds, (also
inhabited by these animals,) to give it a little recreation. On opening the box it
was lying in a corner, contracted into a very small compass, and fast asleep. I
tied a very long cord to its hind leg, and roused it, in return for which I received
numerous growls. When placed on the bank it soon found the way into the water, and
travelled up the stream, apparently delighting in those places which most abounded in
aquatic weeds. Although it would dive in the deep water, it appeared to prefer
keeping close to the bank, occasionally thrusting its beak (with a motion similar to
that of the Duck when it feeds) among the mud and at the roots of the various weeds
lining the margin of the ponds, and which we may readily suppose to be the resort of
insects. After it had wandered some distance up the chain of ponds, feeding about the


shallow water and mud near the banks, it crawled up the bank, and lying down on the
grass, enjoyed the luxury of scratching itself and rolling about.
In this process of cleaning itself, the hind claws were alone brought into use for the
operation, first the claws of one hind leg, then those of the other ; but finding that it
could not use the one to which the string was attached so well as the other which was
disengaged, after repeated trials it gave up the attempt. The body being so capable of
contraction was readily brought within reach of the hind feet, and the head also was
brought so close as to have its share in the universal cleaning process. The animal
remained for more than an hour cleaning itself, after which it had a more sleek and
glossy appearance than before. On placing my hand on a part which it was scratching
at the time, the claws passed over my hand instead of the animal’s body, and I found
that it performed the combing in a remarkably gentle manner. On my attempting to
scratch the place gently, it started away, but not far, and soon resumed the method of
cleaning itself in which I had interrupted it. It permitted me at last to smooth it
gently over the back, but disliked being handled. After I had given it a range for three
hours, it was replaced in its temporary habitation, the box.
The animal was brought in safety to the township of Bong Bong, at which place we
arrived on the 16th, and while the horses were feeding, I took the advantage of the river
passing through the place to indulge it with a bathe, and with an opportunity of feeding
on the banks of the stream. It was fast asleep when I opened its box, but it was soon
roused, and instinctively made for the water, plunging in, and taking a good range of the
cord, which as before was attached to the hind leg. It was exceedingly lively, swam in
the centre of the stream, dived, and appeared in excellent health and spirits. The water
at one part of the river being very clear, I saw its motions distinctly under the water.
On diving it sank speedily to the bottom, swam there for a short distance, and then rose
again to the surface; it ranged the banks, guiding itself in its progress according to the
impressions received by the mandibles, which appeared to me to be used by it as very
delicate organs of touch. It seemed to feed well, for whenever it inserted its beak into
the mud, it evidently procured some food from thence, as on raising the head after
withdrawing the beak, the mandibles were seen in lateral motion as is usual when the
animal masticates. Although several insects were basking and fluttering about the sur-
face of the water, close to it, no attempt was made to capture them, either from its not
seeing them or from its preferring the food which the mud afforded. The motions of
the mandibles in this animal when seeking its food in the mud or water, are the same
as those of a Duck when feeding in similar situations. After feeding it would lie some-
times on the grassy bank, and at others partly in and partly out of the water, combing
and cleaning its coat as usual with the claws of the hind feet. After permitting it to
swim, feed, and clean itself for an hour, it was replaced, although with great reluctance
on its own part, in its box ; it did not, however, as before, betake itself to repose, but
commenced and continued a scratching on the sides of the box.


I did not again open the box to look at the Ornithorhynchus until the following morn-
ing, the 17th, at Mittagong, where we had arrived the previous night. The box had
been placed as usual in my bed-room, but not hearing the usual scratching of the ani-
mal, I had some apprehensions with regard to its safety, and on the morning following
I found them correct, for the box was empty. There was every reason to suppose that
its struggles had raised one of the battens which had not been fastened with sufficient
firmness, and that it had escaped between Bong Bong and Mittagong. Had the animal
died I should have had some consolation in dissecting it, but as it was, all my hopes
were frustrated by its escape.
Having thus failed in bringing the living female specimen to Sidney, I determined
again to devote a portion of time, before the season became too far advanced, to the
investigation of the habits and economy of this interesting animal. The success of my
first journey excited me to fresh attempts with increased energy, to gain as much in-
formation as possible respecting it.
Knowing that I could ensure the kindness of the gentlemen who had before interested
themselves in my investigation of this subject, I left Sidney on the 2nd, and Raby on
the Bth of November, for the Yas, Murrumbidgee, andTumat countries, with the inten-
tion of continuing my observations on the same subject, as w r ell as on other points of na-
tural history or of professional interest that might occur in my way. After an agreeable
journey by way of Goulburn Plains, I arrived at Mundoona on the 15th of November.
The summer season had now advanced considerably in this part of the country.
The river at Yas had fallen greatly, and the banks were covered by an increased
luxuriance of high grass, towering reeds, and bull-rushes. The “ ponds ”of the river
where I had sought for and procured these animals were still, however, of sufficient
depth for them. They were covered with floating aquatic plants, some of which had
displayed their snow-white flowers, which floated on the surface of the water: the
golden blossoms of the Acacia had faded and fallen, and had given place to the less gay
but still pretty flowers of smaller and less conspicuous shrubs and plants. Yet about
those spots where these animals had before been seen in such numbers, I paced the
bank without seeing one. I felt anxious to ascertain in what state the females were, and
how far advanced in the production of their young, or whether they had already brought
them forth; but although evening after evening I sought their usual haunts, I was
unable to procure, or even to be gratified with the sight of, a solitary specimen. I
remarked that the situations where burrows of these animals were known to exist, had
been selected by their instinct where the ponds of the river contained water even during
the dry summer season, and when other parts of the river were nearly dry or formed at
best a mere small trickling rivulet. Of course where the water remained the river-
weeds flourished, and the flowers now produced by them probably attracted insects,
which would furnish these animals with food, in addition to the minute shell-fish which
might also be found about the plants, and on which they also feed.


Can the animals, I thought, confine themselves in their burrows during the period of
gestation ? To ascertain this, two burrows were dug up, about the entrance of which
tracks of the animal had been seen: one was only half completed, the animal having
very probably been killed before the habitation had been finished; the second was empty,
the owner having probably met with a similar fate. The long grass and shrubs were
very luxuriant and dense at this season (the summer) of the year, rendering the explora-
tion or discovery of the burrows of the animals more difficult than we had before expe-
rienced ; and the thick grass afforded shelter for venomous reptiles, among which black
and brown snakes were numerous, which rendered the process not a little dangerous.
Failing in procuring specimens at Yas, I left for Gudarigby, near the Murrumbidgee
River, where I arrived on the 21st. There I remained for several days ; but although I
procured specimens of the animal, the results of the dissection were very unsatisfactory,
the only female shot being young and unimpregnated. From the high reeds extending
some distance out into the river, some difficulty was experienced in getting sufficiently
near the animals; and the specimens, when shot, were often carried by the stream among
the reeds, and lost.
On the 27th of November I left Gudarigby to return to Yas Plains. A female Omi-
thorhynchus had been shot at Mundoona the day before my arrival. In this specimen
the fears I had entertained, that not having been able before to shoot or otherwise pro-
cure an impregnated female, the season would be too far advanced, as the young would
probably have been produced, were realized. This female had evidently just produced
her young, and the uterine organs exhibited no appearance of any more being likely to
be brought forth : this I mention because some have thought that they may breed twice
a-year, which I have reason to doubt. The left uterus in this specimen measured 2»
inches in length and of an inch in diameter. The mammary glands on each side
were very large; but it is a curious and rather an interesting circumstance in the
oeconomy of this animal, that after having been shot, no milk could be expressed from
the glands. This was the more surprising to me, as the glands were very vascular on
the surface, the mammary artery ramifying over them in a most beautiful and distinct
manner. The fur still covered that portion -of the integument on which the ducts
terminated, and there was no appearance of a projecting nipple. In the animals which
I have subsequently seen with a lacteal secretion, there has been no projecting nipple,
and the fur is not even invariably found quite rubbed off at the situation where the
ducts of the gland have their termination. The lacteal glands were conglomerate,
situated one on each side of the abdomen, a short distance above and anterior to the
hind legs, between the abdominal muscles and the integuments, and were covered with
a quantity of cellular membrane, which enveloped and bound together the numerous
lobes of which the whole mass of the mammary or lacteal gland was composed, and at
the same time connected the aggregate mass to the surrounding muscles and integu-
ments. The glands were not prominent, nor easily to be distinguished from without, on
VOL. i. 2 L


account of the very flaccid integuments with which the animal is covered. The smaller
glands were usually of a long narrow form, running in a longitudinal direction towards
one centre, and ending internally in the lacteal ducts, (beautifully displayed by this
specimen in its recent state,) which converged and terminated on the surface of a very
small portion of the integuments. One of the glands measured 3+ inches in length,
and, when expanded, 5f inches in breadth; but when seen lying undissected upon the
abdomen, with the lobes united together closely by the cellular membrane, the breadth
was from 2-f- to 3 inches, and the length the same as that given above.
How different was the appearance in the recent state of this mammary gland from
that which I had previously seen at the Royal College of Surgeons in London, in a spe-
cimen long preserved in spirits, in which I had had the opportunity of witnessing the
injection of the ducts with mercury by my friend Mr. Owen, the mercury exuding, as I
have since seen the milk from the similar ducts, upon the integuments. In the recent
specimen, the pale whitish glands clustered together, seen through the fine delicate cel-
lular membrane which attaches them to the muscles and integuments, and the rami-
fication of the blood-vessels and of the delicate ducts, form a picture of natural beauty
most gratifying to the eye of an admirer of the works of nature, and far surpassing any
of the productions of art.
I sought for the burrow of this animal about the banks of the pond in which it had
been shot, —the same pond on the bank of which the burrow was discovered in which
I caught the first living specimen,—but was unsuccessful.
In the same pond at Mundoona, from which many female specimens had been pro-
cured, two more females were shot; but both proved unimpregnated, with the uteri
merely long thread-like tubes, destitute of ova, and with the abdominal glands hardly
to be perceived on the most minute dissection of the parts.
On the Bth of December I again left Yas for the Murrumbidgee and Tumat coun-
tries : and near Jugiong an opportunity was afforded me of seeing a burrow on the
banks of the Murrumbidgee River, containing some very young Ornithorhynchi, which
appeared to have not long previously been brought forth, being only thinly covered
with hair; a circumstance which corroborated the accounts of the natives in the Mur-
rumbidgee and Tumat countries, who invariably told me, “ Pickaninny tumble down
now from old woman; very small now.” In this burrow were three young ones, in
length about 14- inch: there was not the slightest appearance of anything like shells
about the burrow, or that would lead to the supposition of the eggs being excluded
previously to the appearance of the young ; and I am inclined to consider all the facts
that I have been able to ascertain as militating against an assertion or theory of that
kind. From the burrow above mentioned the “ old woman” had made her escape ; at
all events she was not to be found. I regret that from a want of spirits of wine, in
which these animals could be preserved, (for they died before I had proceeded far on
my journey,) they were spoiled.


Having no new observations on these extraordinary animals to record during the
remainder of my stay in the Tumat, Murrumbidgee, and Yas countries, I will now
continue my observations in another field. I left Yas on the 23rd of December, and
arrived at Lansdown Park, the estate of Mr. Bradley, at Goulburn Plains, on the 24th.
On the 28th of December, with a small party of aborigines, we visited a very beautiful
part of the Wollondilly River, which passes near this estate, and which has the native
name of Koroa. It was a noble sheet of water, extending to some distance, and
abounded in Musk, black, and other kinds of Ducks, as well as in various descriptions
of Water-Fowl. We proceeded to explore the burrow of an Ornithorhynchus which had
been discovered. The aborigines used their hard pointed sticks ', and although the
ground was firm, they succeeded as quickly as we could have done with our spades.
The method of laying open the burrow was by holes dug above at certain distances, as
I have before described. The holes were opened at about four or five feet apart, a stick
being passed up to ascertain the direction of the excavation.
As we proceeded in exploring, there were abundant good omens to encourage us;
for besides fresh tracks of the feet of the animal, pieces of grass, weeds, &c., such as
they strew at the bottom of the termination of the burrow to form a warm nest
for their young, were seen. On every indication of the presence of the animal, the
older blacks quietly passed either the earth from the under surface of the burrow having
recent impressions of its feet or tail, or the pieces of grass, reeds, &c., to one another,
for the opinion of each; and if in favour of the presence of the animal, the digging
up of the burrow was continued, the indications so well known to them giving fresh
hopes and renewed vigour to the diggers. The extent to which this burrow was
continued up the bank in a serpentine form was very great; and after a very laborious
task in exploring it, in consequence of the great hardness of the ground, the termina-
tion was attained at a distance of thirty-five feet from the entrance to the inhabited part.
Extensive as this may appear, burrows have been found of even fifty feet in length.
On arriving at the termination of this very large burrow, a growling was distinctly
heard: this lat first thought proceeded from the old one, which I now believed that I
should have an opportunity of viewing with her young; but thinking it on reconsi-
deration more probable that the old one had forsaken them, as I had observed during
the course of laying open the burrow that we had not seen her come down, in the usual
manner, to ascertain why we destroyed her habitation, I could not account for it, more
especially when the burrow at its termination being laid a little more open, the fur of
the animal or animals was seen. What then surprised me was, that although there
was abundance of growling there was no movement of the animals to escape. On
being taken out they were found to be full-furred young ones, coiled up asleep, and
they growled exceedingly at being exposed to the light of day. There were two, a male

guage to our spade.

and female, of the dimensions of ten inches from the extremity of the beak to that of the
tail. They had a most beautifully sleek and delicate appearance, and seemed never to
have left the burrow. The nest, if it may be so termed, consisted of dry river-weeds,
the epidermis of reeds, and small dry fibrous roots, all strewed over the floor of the
cavity, which was of sufficient size to contain the mother and her young. The animal,
it may here be observed, has from one to four young ones at a time, but the most usual
number is two.
When awakened and placed on the ground they moved about, but did not make such
wild attempts to escape as we had observed in the old ones when caught. It was
rather a subject of surprise to us that we had not captured the old one, or at all events
noticed its escape; but not long after the blacks captured a female on the bank not far
distant from the burrow, which was no doubt the mother of the young which we had just
before taken. The old specimen was in a ragged and wretchedly poor condition; her fur
was rubbed in several places ; the hind claws were also rubbed and wounded ; and she
seemed to be in a very weak state. The milk that could be expressed from the glands
was but trifling in quantity; and in the mother of these young animals such would
have been expected to be the case, for they appeared fully capable of feeding upon a
more substantial diet. This old specimen died at Mittagong, on my way to Sidney, on
the Ist of January 1833. On dissection, the mammary glands were found diminished
in size ; and on cutting into them, but a very trifling secretion of milk was perceived.
The uteri were very small, having merely the small slender tube-like appearance which
I have had occasion to mention in the dissection of other female specimens.
In the young animals the beak above was of a similar colour to the same organ in
the old specimens ; but on its under surface the colour was a beautiful delicate pink, in
consequence of the minute blood-vessels being distinctly visible through the delicate
epidermis. The legs close to the feet were fringed with fine silvery hairs, and the whole
of the fur on the back, although of a more delicate nature, was similar in colour to that
of older specimens; but the ferruginous hue of the whole extent of the under part of the
chest and abdomen had a lighter tinge, dependent probably on the age of the animal.
The eyes of the aborigines, both young and old, glistened, and their mouths watered,
when they saw the fine condition of the young Mallangongs. The exclamations of
“ Cobbong fat” (large, or very fat), and “ Murry budgeree patta” (very good to eat), be-
came so frequent and so earnest, that I began to tremble for the safety of my destined
favourites; and having given them in charge to the natives to convey to Mr. Bradley’s
dwelling, I turned and rode back more than once, from a fear lest they should be all
devoured. But I was wrong in my calculation on the natives’ power of resisting temp-
tation, for they brought them all home safe, and were delighted with the reward of
tobacco which was given them for their trouble 1 .
1 The natives said that these animals were more than eight moons old; if this can be depended on as cor-
rect, they must have been the young of the previous season.


The young animals sleep in various postures; sometimes in an extended position,
and often rolled up like a hedgehog in the form of a ball. They formed an interesting
group, lying in varied attitudes in the box in which I had placed them, and seeming
happy and content. Thus, for instance, one lies curled up like a dog, keeping its beak
warm with the flattened tail, which is brought over it; while the other lies stretched on
its back, the head resting by way of a pillow upon the body of the old one, which lies on
its side, with the back resting against the box; the delicate beak and smooth clean fur of
the young contrasting with the rougher and dirtier appearance of the older one, all fast
asleep. At another time they might be seen, a curious-looking group, one lying on
its back with outstretched paws, another on its side, and the third coiled or rolled up
in the form of a ball. They shift themselves from one position to another, as they may
feel fatigued by lying long in the first; but the favourite posture of the young animals
appears to be lying rolled up like a ball. This is effected by the fore paws being placed
under the beak, with the head and mandibles bent down towards the tail, the hind paws
crossed over the mandibles, and the tail turned up ; thus completing the rotundity of
the figure. One of the figures in the plate displays the appearance of the animal in this
posture, when the tail is pulled down, which can be done without disturbing it; and it
may be closed again like the lid of a snuff-box ’.
Although furnished with a good thick coat of fur, they still seemed particular about
being kept warm and comfortable. They would allow me to smooth their fur; but if
the mandibles were touched they darted away immediately, those parts appearing to be
remarkably sensitive. I could permit the young to run about the room as they pleased;
but the old specimen was so restless, and damaged the walls of the room so much by
attempts at burrowing, that I was obliged to keep her close prisoner in the box, where
during the day she would remain quiet, huddled up with the young ones, but at night
would become very restless, and eager to escape from her place of confinement. A
general growl would issue forth from the group if disturbed when asleep.
There are a number of persons, both born in Australia and long resident there, who
have been in the habit of shooting the Water-Moles, but who had no idea that they inha-
bited burrows in the banks ; and many even of those who were aware that they resided
in burrows, because the natives had told them so, still had no conception of their form
and extent. The opinion of many was that they inhabited the water only, concealing
themselves at the bottom of the rivers, and rising occasionally to the surface to play
about, and to take in a supply of atmospheric air previous to their re-descent. This
belief had induced some of them when they had obtained a living specimen to plunge it
instantly into a tub of water. If the tub was half filled with water, they were surprised
afterwards to find the animal dead; and if the tub was filled nearly to overflowing,
equally surprised to find that it had escaped. I have always observed, when a living
' See Plate xxxiv. for sketches of the different positions of the animal when feeding, asleep cleanintr
itself, &c. 6


specimen has been placed in deep water for even 15 or 20 minutes, without allowing
it an opportunity to get into shallow water, that when taken out it has been much
fatigued by its exertions.
I arrived with the little family of Ornithorhynchi safe at Sidney, and as they survived
for some time, an opportunity was afforded me of observing their habits. The little
animals appeared often to dream of swimming, as I have frequently seen their fore paws
in movement as if in the act. If I placed them on the ground during the day, they ran
about seeking some dark corner for repose ; but when put in a dark corner or in a box,
they huddled themselves up as soon as they became a little reconciled to the place and
went to sleep. I found that they would sleep on a table, sofa, or indeed in any place ;
but, if permitted, would always resort to that in which they had previously been accus-
tomed to repose. Still, although for days together they would sleep in the place made
up for them, yet on a sudden, from some unaccountable caprice, they would shift their
resting-place, and seek repose behind a box or in some dark corner in preference to
their former habitation. They usually reposed side by side like a pair of furred balls,
and awful little growls issued from them when disturbed; but when very sound asleep
they might be handled and examined with impunity. One evening both the animals
came out about dusk, went as usual and ate food from the saucer, and then commenced
playing one with the other like two puppies, attacking with their mandibles and raising
the fore paws against each other. In the struggle one would get thrust down, and at
the moment when the spectator would expect it to rise again and renew the combat, it
would commence scratching itself, its antagonist looking on and waiting for the sport to
be renewed. When running they are exceedingly animated, their little eyes glisten, and
the orifices of their ears contract and dilate with rapidity : if taken into the hands at this
time for examination, they struggle violently to escape, and their loose integuments
render it difficult to retain them. Their eyes being placed so high on the head, they
do not see objects well in a straight line, and consequently run against everything in
the room during their perambulations, spreading confusion among all the light and
readily overturnable articles. I have occasionally seen them elevate the head as if to
regard objects above or around them. Sometimes I have been able to enter into play
with them, by scratching and tickling them with my finger; they seemed to enjoy it
exceedingly, opening their mandibles, biting playfully at the finger, and moving about
like puppies indulged with similar treatment. As well as combing their fur to clean it
when wet, I have also seen them peck it with their beak (if the term may be allowed) as
a Duck would clean its feathers. Between this and the combing of the hind feet, it is
interesting to see them engaged in the operations of the toilet, by which their coats ac-
quire an increased clean and glossy appearance. When I placed them in a pan of deep
water, they were eager to get out after being there for only a short time; but when the
water was shallow, with a turf of grass placed in one corner, they enjoyed it exceedingly.
They would sport together, attacking one another with their mandibles, and roll over in


the water in the midst of their gambols; and would afterwards retire, when tired, to the
turf, where they would lie combing themselves. It was most ludicrous to observe these
uncouth-looking little beasts running about, overturning and seizing one another with
their mandibles, and then in the midst of their fun and frolic coolly inclining to one
side and scratching themselves in the gentlest manner imaginable. After the cleaning
operation was concluded, they would perambulate the room for a short time, and then
seek repose. They seldom remained longer than 10 or 15 minutes in the water at a
time.
At first I was inclined to consider them as nocturnal animals, but I afterwards found
that their time of leaving their resting-place was exceedingly irregular, both during the
day and night. They seemed, however, more lively and more disposed to ramble about
the room after dark, generally commencing about dusk; but all their movements in
this respect were so very irregular that no just conclusions could be drawn, further
than that they were both night and day animals, preferring the cool and dusky even-
ing to the heat and glare of noon. This habit was not confined to the young speci-
mens, for the old ones were equally irregular, sometimes sleeping all day and becoming
lively at night, and sometimes the reverse. I have often found one asleep and the other
running about at the same period of the day, the male alone first leaving the nest and
the female remaining asleep: he would, after feeding and running about for a short
time, return, curl himself up, and sleep, and then the female would leave in her turn.
Although, however, they frequently left thus alternately, at other times they would
suddenly go out together. One evening, when both were running about, the female
uttered a squeaking noise as if calling to her companion, which was in some part of the
room behind the furniture, and was invisible; he immediately answered her in a similar
note; and noting the direction from which the answer to her signal came, she ran at
once to the place where he had secreted himself.
It was very ludicrous to see the uncouth little animals open their mandible-like bps
and yawn, stretching out the fore paws, and extending the webs of the fore feet to
their utmost expansion.
It often surprised me how they contrived to reach the summit of a bookcase or any
other elevated piece of furniture. This was at last discovered to be effected by the
animal supporting its back against the wall, and placing the feet against the bookcase,
and thus, by means of the strong cutaneous muscles of the back and the claws of the
feet, contriving to reach the top very expeditiously. They performed this mode of
climbing often, so that I had frequent opportunities of witnessing the manner in which
it was done.
The food I gave them was bread soaked in water, chopped egg, and meat minced very
small: although at first I presented them with milk, they did not seem to prefer it
to water.
Some time after my arrival at Sidney, to my great regret, the little creatures became


meagre; their coats lost the sleek and beautiful appearance which had before called
forth so much admiration ; they ate little ; yet they ran about the room as before and
appeared lively. But these external symptoms argued strongly against their being in
a state of health. When wet, their fur became matted, never appearing to dry so rea-
dily as before; and the mandibles, and indeed every part of the animal, indicated any-
thing but a healthy condition. How different was their appearance now from the time
when I removed them from the burrow : then their plump and sleek appearance roused
even the apathetic blacks; now the poor creatures could only excite commiseration for
their reduced condition. The young female died on the 29th of January 1833, and the
male on the 2nd of February, having been kept alive during the space of nearly five
weeks, and thus my expectations of conveying them to England in a living state were
frustrated.
