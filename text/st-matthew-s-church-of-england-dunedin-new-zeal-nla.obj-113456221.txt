[Bazaar Committee.]
ST. MATTHEW'S VESTRY,
(Dunedin, Mew Zealand, 15th June, 1883.
Sir, —
I take the liberty of referring you to the annexed sketch of our Church building, and to inform
you that the Bazaar Committee, on behalf of the Congregation, has rented the Garrison Hall, Dunedin, for the
purpose of holding a Bazaar during Christmas week of this year, to enable them to obaitn monetary aid to
discharge some of the mortgage debt of upon the Church.
As I notice by the London Shippers' Directory that you have business connections with this- Colony, would it
be taking too great a liberty to ask of you to kindly favor us with a small donation in money or kind on behalf of
the great work we have in hand, and for which funds are so urgently required ?
Messrs. Perrott & Perrott, the old-established Packers, in London, will receive any parcels of goods,
should you be so disposed to favor us with the same ; and the London Manager of the New Zealand Shipping
Company, Limited, is instructed to ship out any packages by their steamers leaving in September (s.s. “lonic ")
and in October (s.s. “ Catalonia ”) at a reduced rate of freight.
The Bank of New Zealand, No. 1 Victoria-street, London, will kindly receive any donations in money,
and place the same to the credit of the St. Matthew’s-Church Bazaar Account, Dunedin.
All donations will be fully acknowledged in the Otago Daily Times newspaper, containing an account of
the Bazaar, and a copy will be forwarded to each donor.
St. Matthew's, the last built of the three Episcopal Churches within the City proper of Dunedin, Otago,
is situated in the centre of a large and populous district, embracing one-third of the entire area of the town, and
included in it is the suburban municipality of Mornington. Seven-eighths of the population residing in the
districts named are comprised of the artizan and laboring classes.
In conclusion, the writer would mention that he has a brother in England—-the Rev. John Callis, M.A.,
Rector of the South Heigham Parish, Norwich —to whom references could be made, and again trusting that
some of our friends at Home may be enabled to “ Come over and help us,”
I am, Sir,
Yours obediently,
CHAS. CALLIS,
Hon. Treasurer St. Matthew's Vestry.
(Late Secretary Royal New Zealand Commissioners Sydney and Melbourne
International Exhibitions, 1879,-80,-81.)
