THE FINANCIAL HISTORY AND CONDITION
OF THE
COLONY OF QUEENSLAND
l< There is treasure to he desired in the dwellings of the wise, hut the
foolish man spendeth it upT —Proverbs of Solomon.
The financial history of a colony is the his-
tory of the varying condition of its people.
The financial condition of a colony is an index
to the character of its government. The
chances and changes which perplex econo-
mists and financiers in the old world hardly
exist here; wars and rumors of wars exert no
appreciable influence upon our expenditure ;
and armies and fleets figure not in our Trea-
surer’s budget. Our whole expenditure is, so
to speak, internal to ourselves, and within our
own control; and our income may be calcu-
lated with precision by any one acquainted
with the principles regulating such estimates,
and capable of applying them to local circum-
stances. It would seem almost as impossible
for a Colonial Treasurer to go wrong in his
estimates as to earn distinction by being right.
His perplexities should naturally be few, and
his plans clear, distinct, and straightforward.
But he would greatlj’ err, who inferred
from such conditions, that the successful
conduct of financial affairs in Queensland vyas
a mere matter of course. Other things being
equal, men differ; and it is quite possible for
incompetent or obstinate or dishonest politi-
cians, to reduce the state of public affairs to
one of hopeless confusion. Its financial his-
tory may thus become one of financial blun-
ders, and its condition one of irredeemable
debt and burdensome taxation. When such
results have been attained, a spirit of enquiry
is excited, and the question is asked “ Why
are these things so ?”
What is the financial condition of the colony
of Queensland just now, as icspects its public
debt? In round numbers, the colony owes
nearly four and a quarter millions sterling, not
including undefined but outstanding claims.
On that debt the annual interest will _ be
£259,166. Divided amongst the population,
the indebtedness of every living soul amongst
us is nearly £43, and the yearly payment £2
7s. There is no country or settlement within
the limits of civilization that can boast so dis-
proportionate a public debt.
Experience would seem to indicate that any
reduction of this heavy incumbrance dwells
Jess in the regions of probability than in the
prophetic vision of the seer. Since the colony
has been blessed with parliamentary govern-
ment the average deficiency in its public reve-
nue as compared with its current expenditure
has been £37,000 a year, and last year (1869)
that deficiency was more than £40,000. So
far from paying the loan out of income, we
were told—and before the last year s disastrous
result—that it would be necessary to borrow
more money to fill the gap left by that in-
come's inadequacy. It seems somewhat
strange that the announcement of this fact
was accompanied by a recommendation to
“ rest and be thankful.”
But, taking that advice as worth considera-
tion, it is desirable to consider as well from
what we are to rest and for what we are to he
grateful. Not to attack individuals, but to
expose a system —not to serve the interests of
a party, but to inform the public—is the
enquiry now attempted. The time is seasona-
blw and the necessity urgent.
That attempt necessitates a reference to the
financial history of the colony—a history per-
haps technical and deficient in liveliness
of incident which sometimes gives interest to
a narrative. But there is, after all, something
striking in the mo mtonous procession of fail-
ures with their wailing choruses of erring pro-
phesies, and broken promises, and repp ach,
and complaint, which has marked the pro-
gresses of most of the Colonial Treasurers of
Queensland. Nor can we forget that that his-


tory is a record of errors, for which we are By the year 1862. all our Parliamentary
ourselves in pirt responsible, and from which checks were in fu os ensi eg .
we are at this moment suffering the Audit Act; responsible advisers of the
we are at this moment suffering.
If we refer to the early, as well as the later,
years of our financial history, we shall often
be struck, more even than by errors in calcu-
lating the revenue, by the great disproportion
between the estimated requirements of the
Government for a future year, and the actual
wants realised. In some cases the Colonial
Treasurer seems to have been engaged in a
perpetual struggle with the demands of his
colleagues, and to preserve his budget as nearly
as possible intact; in others he silently sub-
mitted to his fate, and floated unresistingly
from bad to worse. Mor is the»inability or un-
willingness of Parliament to check the system
of unauthorised expenditure which marked
Sir George Bowen’s government from the very
beginning, less remarkable. Narrowing the
discussion to merely technical points, the 18th
clause of the Audit Act of 1861 (25 Victoria,
No. 15) charges the Auditor-General with the
duty of ascertaining that the suras mentioned
in the Treasurer’s vouchers sent to him under
the same Act are “legally available for, and ap-
plicable to, the service or purpose mentioned.”
The marginal note to the clause is “ Auditor-
General to be guided by appropriation.” The
meaning of that is supplied by the very title
of the Appropriation Acts, “An act to autho-
rize the appropriation out of the consolidated
revenue fund, of certain sums, to make good
the supplies,” <&c. But it would be hard to
find a single year in which large sums have not
been paid and large liabilities incurred without
the shadow of authority from any vote of the
Legislature, and in direct defiance of the Acts
specially passed to secure the honest employ-
ment of the public revenue.
1860, the first year of the colony, presents
us with the solitary instance of a satisfactory
surplus. The Treasurer advanced £18,600*
out of the revenue in anticipation of a public
loan for special purposes. And if we deduct
that from his payments, the balance appearing
by the Auditor-General’s statement to the cre-
dit of the Consolidated Revenue fund for the
year was £17,186; that is, the current receipts
exceeded the current payments by that sum.
1861 exhibits a slight variation. The Par-
liamentary vote in the preceding session for
that year, was £203,973. But in the current
session, £30,022 was found necessary and voted
as for an additional service. The total autho-
rised charge was £233,995. The revenue was
£238,238 ; and had the expenditure been with-
in the vote, would have left a surplus ; but the
actual expenditure was £255,180, and after
absorbing the repaid £18,600, the Auditor’s
balance sheet showed a debit of £1285.
* In almost all cases, for clearness sake, fractional parts
of pounds have been omitted.
Governor to be bound by it; and a representa-
tive assembly to see that its provisions were
observed. All the machinery of “ Constitu-
tional’’ government was in full play. What
were the results ?
In the preceding session, on the voting of
supplies, Sir R. Mackenzie had estimated his
expenditure at £215,545. but in the current
session, (May, 1862) and upon six months fur-
ther experience, he found it necessary to obtain
an additional estimate for £62.218. Thus his
total estimates (first and second) for the year,
and upon which his parliamentary votes were
got, was £277,763. The revenue be estimated
at £225,700. but it realised instead £295,286,
exclusive of £2OOO repaid from the loan fund.
On the votes there should have been then a
surplus of £17.523. Instead of that there was,
on the Auditor-General’s statement, a deficit
of £21.025, and the actual disbursements had
been £317,026, An explanation of this was
afforded in 1863 by the then Treasurer asking
for and obtaining “for the service of the year
1862, additional supplementary” £42,610. Ihe
following figures may assist us in coming to a
conclusion: —

standing claims not paid on the 31st Decem-
ber, 1862, ...
From this examination it results that there
was, in the year 1862, a sum of £38,363 paid
by the Executive, not only without the sanc-
tion but in defiance of the true intent and
meaning of the Appropriation and Audit Acts,
and a further debt of £3247 incurred; and that
Parliament was asked in September, 1863, to
give an authority to spend what, in reality,
had been already spent the year before without
it. . ,
It is easy to trace, in the gross irregularity
which these incontrovertible facts disclose, the
source of much of our financial troubles.
This melancholy narrative of the incidents of
even a flourishing year shows us,—firstly, an
estimate of expenditure so far wrong as to re-
quire increase by nearly thirty per cent, before
the close of the session in which it was brought
forward; secondly, in spite of an income un-
expectedly so large as even then to afford a
surplus had the votes of Parliament been ad-
hered to, a large deficiency instead ; and lastly,
and worst of all, an expenditure of nearly


*,40,000 without a shadow ef a vote autho-
rizing its payment. Of what use was the
Audit Act, and where was the control of the
Auditor General ? One was quietly ignored,
and for the other let the facts speak. The im-
punity with which these things were done in
due time bore natural and abundant fruit.
For the history of the year 1863 surpasses
that of its predecessor in its blunders, its ex-
travagance, and its profligacy. 1862 had
closed, as we have seen, with a debit balance
on the whole consolidated revenue account of
£21,025. But in accordance with the practice
of Colonial Treasurers, not a word was noted
of that in the printed estimates for the follow-
ing year. For all they showed it would start
with a clean sheet. The revenue was esti-
mated at £317,200, and the outlay at £308.048.
The invariable “ estimated excess of revenue
over expenditure” appears again, although
with Sir Robert Mackenzie’s usual anticipa-
tory moderation in dealing with revenue, for
only £9152. This was in April, 1862 ; but by
June 26 it was discovered that £13,560 more
would be wanted, and the surplus disappeared.
But shortly after this last estimate had
passed, the Treasurer found his self-respect
wounded by the promotion of Mr. Macalister,
his junior in the Ministry, and formerly leader
of the opposition, to the post of Vice-President
of the Executive, on Mr. Herbert’s temporary
absence in England, and he resigned. A com-
plimentary letter from Sir George Bowen
thinly disguised the pleasure with which that
governor and Messrs. Herbert and Macalister
viewed his retirement. His resignation is to be
regretted, for, notwithstanding a pettiness of
view, and an uncertainty of action, sometimes
almost assuming the aspect of insincerity,
which characterized his whole political career,
he seems to have occasionally evinced a desire,
and to have been sometimes earnest in at-
tempting, to keep the balance on the right side.
Unfortunately that wish was unaccompanied
by either firmness in resisting expenditure, or
foresight in anticipating the consequences of
the irregularities which he was led into parti-
cipating. The dominant three in the Execu-
tive had found him weak and vacillating, and
intermittently obstructive on the side of
honesty. These were qualities inconvenient
in a colleague, and harmless in an assailant;
so they quietly, and not always ostensibly,
made his position one which no man of honor
could retain. The procedure was characteris-
tic and the result natural.
In August, 1862, the late Mr. Thomas de
Lacy Moffat took the Treasury, and it is to be
presumed that a harmonious co-operation pre-
vailed between his colleagues and himself
during the whole of his official career. What
that amicable community of feeling ended in,
wo shall now see.
It will be remembered that the original estr-
mate of expenditure for 1863 was £308,048,
To this was added an “ additional estimate”
of £13,560. But in July, 1863, the Assembly
were edified by “ supplementary estimates,
1863” for £47,945, of which they dutifully
voted £47,466. On the 2nd September of the
same year “ additional supplementary esti-
mates 1863” for £19,165 were asked, and on
the 20th May, 1864, the Assembly were again
called upon for and voted as ‘’additional sup-
plementary” for 1863 £11,604. On an original
estimate of £308,048, the additions altogether
were more than ninety thousand pounds, of
which a very large portion, following the pre-
cedent of the preceding year, must have been
incurred and paid before a shadow of parlia-
mentary authority could have been obtained.
As we see, £11,604 was not so authorised until
1864. The actual receipts for the year were
£295,215, the actual disbursements £355,791.
Continuing the general account, the debit of
the Consolidated Revenue fund was £70,673
13s sd.
It might appear unnecessary to go into simi-
lar details in dealing with the history of every
year, but that of 1864 presents some circum-
stances so remarkable, and so thoroughly cha-
racteristic of Sir George Bowen and his
advisers, that a careful examination of the
transactions of the time cannot be omitted.
In the Estimates laid before the Assembly the
probable income of the year was calculated at
£417,250, the expenditure at £351.398. Nothing
was stated of the enormous deficit of the pre-
ceding year, and the usual “ Excess of
Revenue” appeared, and at £65,312. On turn-
ing to the Auditor-General’s abstract of
receipts and disbursements for 1864, the actual
cash revenue is stated at £369,425; the actual
expenditure for the year, £440,169. This year
therefore exhibited, in full splendor of error,
an estimate of revenue very far over and an
estimate of expenditure far under what were
actually realised. There was a deficiency of
£70,743, instead of a surplns of £65,312. Add
this to that of the preceding year, and the
total Treasury deficit would be £141,146, or
two-fifths of a years’ income.
That the old illegal and dishonest plan of
incurring debt and paying money without au-
thority was freely resorted to this year there
can be no doubt. The amount actually voted
for 1864 in the session of 1863 was £331,679.
Not till the 13th September, 1864, when two-
thirds of the year had well-nigh gone, was the
first supplementary sum of £45,804 voted in
aid of the supplies granted in the previous
session. And in June, 1865, the then Treasu-
rer asked £65,356 more. Taking the vote for
1864, and the disbursements and the dates of
the additional votes, there can be no doubt that
a sum varying from sixty to eighty thousand


pounds represented the money spent in excess nue, and the £70,673 being wanted, was taken.
of anthoiity during the last six months of
1864.
What were the Legislature about? What
the constitutional governor ? What his respon-
sible advisers? And what that opposition
which numbered amongst its not least active
members Mr. T. B. Stephens? As an instance
of the attention paid by all to their duty the
following addendum to the Treasurer’s esti-
mate of “ Additional Supplementary Estimate,
No. 2, 1864.” presented to the Assembly 19th
June, 1865, is quoted.
Interest on debentures £20,688 0
Sinking Fund ... ... ... 7,388 10
Civil Service Superannuation Fund 718 0
Provided by Colonial Acts but not included in Appro
priation Act of 1861.
Had any irreverent critic of representative
government ventured to predict that in a colony
blessed with it in full perfection—governor,
government, assembly, and all would have
forgotten to provide for the interest or gua-
ranteed repayment of the public debt—the
most tender of public obligations—he would
have been derided as an idiot. Had he ven-
tured to hint even that this neglect would have
remained for two years without amendment,
his idiocy would have been charged with
malevolency. Yet on the 19th of June, 1860,
the Colonial Treasurer certified that these ap-
parently monstrous impossibilities were real
facts.
But these were not the worst financial mal-
versations or errors of the year. It started, as
has been said, with a debit balance of £70,673,
and as time went on, and further deficiency
stared the government in the face, the neces-
sity for some means of meeting it was too
plain to be avoided. Then, indeed, the un-
happy facility of the first Colonial Treasurer
in admitting* unauthorised expenditure’ bore a
bitter fruit. By the Loan Act of 1861 a sum
of £27,000 had been authorised for immigra-
tion purposes. By another Act of 1863 (passed
at the same time with the Appropriation Act
for 1864) £lOO,OOO more had been sanctioned.
The disbursements from this loan left at the
beginning of 1864 £89,970. This was a tempt-
ing unexpended amount. So, without a
shadow of parliamentary authority, and in
defiance both of the Loan Acts and the Audit
Act, a sum of £70,673 was ‘transferred,’ as
the phrase ran, and the Consolidated Revenue
fund was said to have started with “ a clean
sheet.”
A feeble attempt at justifying this most
flagitious procedure was set up on the pretext
that, as under the Land Act of 1860, land
orders, available in buying land only, had been
issued to immigrants to the nominal amount of
£146,752. and had been employed as they were
intended in the payment for public lands, that
sum was, in reality, duo to the general reve-
The reply is simple. Even if the facts justi-
fied such an argument,* it could legitimately
go no farther than to enforce an application to
parliament to authorise the appropriation of
the Immigration Loan fund to the general ex-
penditure, but certainly not to sanction the
abstraction of a portion of that fund at the
mere pleasure of the Executive without such
authorisation.
In truth the whole excuse was as much a
useless subterfuge as the original offence was
a discreditable afterthought. The Ministry of
the day, when they asked for £lOO,OOO, gave
not the slightest hint of their intention to use it
to make up a deficit which, it may be charita-
ble to suppose, that they did not even antici-
pate. The money was asked for purposes of
Immigration, outside the land order system,
and w«s understood to be so asked for and so
granted. It is to be supposed that the Assem-
bly believed the Treasurer when, in the middle
of 1863, he told them there would be a surplus
in 1864, and did not suppose what he did not
tell them—that there would beaheavy deficit at
the end of the year in which he was
So believing, they granted a supply by way of
taxation for ordinary expenditure, and by way
of loan for distinct and specified purposes.
The government, without asking their leave,
took the loan to meet the deficiency in the
revenue. These few sentences summarize the
facts. One of the fundamental laws of the
constitution was thus violated, in that by a
mere arbitrary exercise of at best an opportu-
nity, the executive assumed to themselves the
right of varying and directing the appropria-
tion of monies granted by way of supply—a
right which it is in the very essence of Eng-
lish representative government to assume as
belonging to parliament —and to parliament
alone. No such considerations prevailed, how-
ever, with the legislature of 1864 5. If the
majority of the members even knew their
essential rights, they willingly consented to
their being set aside; although since that time
the issue of land orders has, in consonance
with common sense, been treated as forming
no part of the revenue and as altogether extra-
neous of the monetary balance sheet of the
colony. But the procedure described bears
indelible testimony to the unscrupulousness of
the then Governor and his * responsible advi-
sers.’ He taught to apt pupils the lesson that
we have, in fact, no such thing as responsible
* Which they could not. The land order was never reve-
nue, but always expenditure—expenditure, not of money,
but territory—of territory for a special object, settlement
by immigration—which settlement formed the credit to the
outlay in land. In fact the land order was simply an in-
strument registering the fact that A B had come to Queens-
land, and was to have so many acres of land for coming.
The system was altogether outside questions of revenue
and expenditure as in their direct application.

1864, despite the aid from the loan fund,
ended with a deficiency of £70,743. But.the
Treasurer was sanguine and buoyant. “ Ex-
cess of revenue” again appeared as a promise
on the estimates. The revenue for 1865 he
calculated at £478 000, and the expenditure at
£439,348, leaving a surplus of £39.152. Ihe
actual receipts for the year were £472,461. and
the disbursements £459,025, But the receipts
were swelled for six months of the year by ad-
ditional taxation not by the
Treasurer when proposing his estimate in
the preceding session, and which probably
added £lO,OOO to the Customs product. Again,
a sum of £21,664 “premium on debentures
sold during the year” appears as revenue,
under the head of miscellaneous receipts,
whereas it was not revenue. It was a profit,
to be held in suspense against a possible future
loss, (which loss did actually afterwaids
accrue) or in reduction of the amount of de-
bentures to be issued. So that, although the
apparent surplus to go in reduction of the last
years’ deficit was, by this manipulation of
figures, made to appear about £20,000, there
was, in fact, a deficiency of about £9OO, instead
of the promised surplus of £39,000. But to
escape the tediousness of constant correction,
and to give the Treasury every possible con-
cession, it may be assumed that the balance to
the debit of the consolidated icvenue at the end
of 1865 was as stated. £49,972. It should be
mentioned that on the sudden and melancholy
death of Mr. Moffatt, in the latter part of 1864,
he was succeeded in December of that year by
Mr. J. P. Bell, whose first year of administra-
tion (1865) was, as to expenditure, not far in
excess of his predecessors’ estimates.
The year 1866 was one of general distress
and monetary pressure, and it was not to be
expected that Queensland would escape the
prevailing depression. But to allege that de-
pression as the main cause of her public finan-
cial difficulties is to talk nonsense. Such a
pretext is irreconcilable with facts. Whatever
might have been the influence it excited upon
private trade and private enterprise, it may
he made abundantly clear that the public per-
plexities of the time were almost altogether
owing to the errors of the men who were then
dominant in the Executive.
In the estimates laid before Parliament in
1865, the cash revenue anticipated for 1866
was stated at £642,400 and a surplus of
£52,152 was calculated upon. But before the
session closed, a supplementary estimate was
presented for £40.368 as against the general
revenue, and of £BBOO to be defrayed from spe-
cial receipts under the Act 28 Victoria
end of 1866 came the revenue had realised
only £490,269, the expenditure had been
£651,700, and the balance sheet exhibited a
deficiency of £161,430. not including outstand-
ing liabilities which had to be met. The prin-
cipal deficiency was in the land revenue,
which, in defiance of all probability derived
from experience, was estimated to produce
in cash receipts seventy per cent, more than it
was bringing in 1865. The actual results were
a decrease of 39| per cent, on the total sales,
and 50 per cent, on the cash receipts. Mr.
Macalister’s department was_ singularly un-
happy in its financial calculations.
Buc it is necessary, rightly to apprehend the
predicament into which the Herbert cum
Macalister Ministry had plunged the country
to refer briefly to the loan transactions. At
different times —in 1861. 1863, and 1864, loans
had been authorised to the extent of £1,850.236.
During the year 1866 the proceeds of the de-
bentures were exhausted and without some
additional accommodation, beyond the ordi-
nary loan proceeds, the overdraft on the loan
account would have been £449,344. The total
floating debt of the colony —not including the
ordinary outstanding liabilities at the close of
the year, probably thirty or forty thousand
pounds—would have been £610,774. Some
portion of this enormous sum was found by
laying hands on what had been constituted,
and were in fact, trust funds. The Savings
Banks deposits(a) and the sinking fund accu-
mulating towards the payment of the first loan
of £123,000, were both absorbed in providing for
the extraordinary expenditure which Mr.
Macalister’s railway administration and the
extravagance prevalent in every department
had entailed upon the colony.
Early in 1866 it became known that Mr.
Herbert intended leaving Queensland, an inten-
tion probably not weakened by that astute politi-
cian’s perception of a coming storm. He re-
signed the Colonial Secretaryship, in which
office be was succeeded by Sir B. Mackenzie,
on the Ist February. On the Ist March the
Postmaster-Generalship having been created
a political office for the purpose, Mr. Douglas
accepted it, and with it the leadership of the
Legislative Council. ( b )
The first step of the Ministry when Parlia-
ment met in April was to obtain a loan, and
on the 29tb of May the Governor’s assent was
a The flagitious and illegal appropriation of the savings
bank fund was denied ‘on authority’ in January 1867 but
subsequently by both the late and present Treasurers, the
fact has been admitted. The deposit of debentures as
against the amount taken was proposed by Mr. Stephens
last year.

given to a bill authorising one for £1,170,950. an issue, which, not being so exchangeable.
Pending the realisation of the debentures, the
debit balances were rapidly rising in amount
and the revenue falling short The Govern-
ment bankers were not disposed in the face of
a heavy overdrawn account to advance here
upon debentures for whose realisation they I
had to wait. Negotiations took place with
the Sydney Agency of the Agra and Master-
man’s Bank, which were brought to nought by
the stoppage of that institution during the
monetary panic at home. Neither the effort nor
the result tended to increase the liberality of a
Government bankerthus attempted tobe passed
bye. And it is to be carefully borne in mind
that to the illegal practice of “ unauthorised
expenditure’’ resorted to to cover the difficul-
ties arising from enormous estimates and from
gross extravagance did these difficulties prin-
cipally accrue. The failure of all the banks in
the colony could not of itself have placed the
Ministry and the public credit in that ignomi-
nious position which this increasing floating
debt and deficiency entailed upon them. One
of the results was a total loss on the placing
of the loans of £154,546. (a)
'lt could not be but that such a financial
complication would produce serious difficulty
to the government. Humors went abroad of
dishonored and delayed cheques, and the
alleged refusal of the Government bankers to
cash one given by the Saving’s Bank in repay-
ment of a deposit was alluded to amidst consi-
derable excitement in the Legislative Assem-
bly. The actual state of the public funds was
cloaked and palliated and excused, and the
commercial panic in London was blamed for
what had been produced by bad management
here. Then some bright genius proposed to
meet the evil by an issue of inconvertible
notes. This renewal of an exploded theory
was hailed as a discovery ofincalculable value.
The fallacy that “ a paper currencycannot be
issued in excess so long as every note issued
represents property or has a foundation of
actualproperty to rest on, ” long since conclu-
sively refuted by Mill, was resuscitated. The
land of the country was to be coined into money,
and a monetary millennium was to follow.
The authors of the scheme seem to have
thought that there was some magic in the note
which must secure to it perpetual retention as
a real value of its original nominal one. They
forgot, or, perhaps, never troubled themselves
with the knowledge, that all currency arises
from the necessities of barter, and that the
demands of the community practically control
its value. The average note issue of the local
banks was, at the time, about £lBO,OOO. The
right of issue of these banks could not be
taken from them, and their notes were
exchangeable for gold on demand. How, then,

would be intrinsically less valuable, was to
supersede then: and secure double the circula-
tion as well, was not attempted to be explained.
The ‘ greenbacks’ of the United States were
cited as a precedent, but the citation was pecu-
liarly infelicitous. One result of that system
was a loss estimated variously at from thirty
to fifty per cent, on the whole sum circulated,
a loss arising from the depreciation of the
greenback as compared with a currency
founded on a metallic basis. Could the
£610,874 have been paid in inconvertible notes
—could they even have been forced upon the
public —the only result would have been that
(suppose the public credit to be maintained)
thev would have depreciated in exact propor-
tion to the excess of the issue over the ordi-
nary circulation. Ultimately, directly or indi-
rectly, that loss would have fallen on the
colony. If the state profited, it would only
have been by robbing the community—a
species of suicide of which the assignats sys-
tem of the French revolution furnishes a
striking illustration.
A committee of the Assembly was ap-
pointed to inquire into, and report upon the
proposal It reported in favor of it; and it is
a suggestive fact that the present Colonial
Treasurer was one of the majority who voted
for the report. Then Sir George Bowen inter-
fered, and, illustrating in his conduct Lord
Mansfield’s celebrated description of men
“ who, whenever they do arrive at a right con-
clusion, never do so from a right reason,”
resorted to proceedings which upset the
Government. The Macalister administration
was compelled to resign.
It is not necessary to narrate here those very
peculiar manoeuvres which resulted after much
and characteristic duplicity on the part of the
prime movers, in the ultimate formation of
another Macalister ministry. The late Mr. J.
D. M’Lean and Mr. Watts were persuaded in
the exigency to join with Mr. Macalister, Mr.
Bell, and Mr. Lilley, in forming what was called
a strong administration. Mr. M’Lean’s ability
as a successful man of business and Mr.
Watts’s honesty of purpose were certainly cal-
culated to recommend them to the public. Mr,
Bell took the Lan Is instead of the Treasury,
which latter office Mr. M’Lean assumed, appa-
rently to the public satisfaction. The new
government proceeded with all speed to
mature their measures.
It is unnecessary to describe Mr. Bell’s esti-
mates for 1867. They disappeared from the
Assembly, and no result of any value would
follow from discussing them. Mr. M’Lean.
showed a considerable diminution in expendi-
ture and a new method of meeting the diffi-
culties of his situation. But the genius of
failure seems to preside over the preparation of
our Queensland Treasurer’s estimates, and Mr.


M’Lean’s presented no exception to the gene- he was not permitted to witness the result,
ral family likeness.
Temporary loans by means of Treasury
Bills at fixed dates formed one crutch, and
additional taxation another, on which the tot-
tering steps of the public credit were to be
supported. And to give some appearance of
consistency to the members of the old Minis-
try a note issue system was to be organised,
which, however, not to place the Treasurer
(who had opposed it) in a false position, was to
be convertible, and partly on a metallic basis,
which again was to be provided for by further
debt. The political house that Jack built,
showed no greater variety of dovetailing
opposing views and conflicting inclinations.
The first issue of Treasury Bills to the ex-
tent of £300,000, was to stop the gap in what
may be termed the loan expenditure until the
debentures were realised. They were to bear
interest at 10 per cent., and they produced
£298,671. They figure in the statistical regis-
ters of 1867-8 as “ to be repaid,” a consumma-
tion which never came.
The note issue was thus devised: the Govern-
ment were empowered to issue Treasury notes,
keeping always an amount in coin and bullion
equal to one-third of the issue, and Treasury
Bills at 10 per cent, equal to two-thirds. For
this purpose Treasury Bills to an extent not
exceeding £300,000 were authorised, of which
£lOO,OOO worth might be sold as required
and bullion purchased with the proceeds.
The other £200,000 were to remain in
deposit. From this it would appear that the
advocates of the scheme expected an issue of
£300,000 in all. It was simply a thinly dis-
guised attempt to get the use of the £300,000
by paying interest on Treasury Bills for one
third the amount. The result was in accord-
ance with the theory of the great political
economists of the day. The Treasury note
circulation has not been more than £40,000,
and the total note circulation of the colony
was little more in 1868 than in 1866. The
Treasury issue has lessened by its amount
that of the banks, the public requirement con-
trolling both. The help to the Government
has been as trifling as the expectation of it
was delusive.
But in Mr. McLean’s additional taxation he
had a more reliable, although over estimated
resource. Stamp duties of various kinds, and
an ad valorem, duty of 10 percent, on imports,
were proposed, the last after acrimonious dis-
cussion deiug reduced to 7J per cent. His
estimate of cash revenue was £832,340, his
expenditure he reckoned at £611,899. His
surplus was stated at £220,441. There was a
little controversy on the accuracy of these
calculations, but Parliament separated on the
whole tolerably well satisfied with their work,
and full ot faith iu the Treasurer, Unhappily
being killed by a fall from his horse in
December, 1866. It is not to be conceived that
daring so short a term of office and at so troubled
a time, he could be individually responsible
for the accuracy of the estimates he put for-
ward ; and it is as little to be conceived that
had he discovered their deceptiveness he would
not have applied himself effectually to the re-
duction of the expenditure. It was a great
misfortune to the colony that he was so soon
and so suddenly taken away.
When the year 1867 came to a close the
great difference between estimate and reality
was conclusively apparent. The Customs
estimated at £416,040 produced only £283,366.
The Stamp duties realised £29,880 against
£35,000, The land revenue instead of £183,000
brought £167,770. The actual cash revenue
on the whole was £610,860 instead of £832,340.
But the expenditure was £661,795, and the
total debit on the account current of the con-
solidated revenue was £212,365, an addition to
that of 1866 of more than £50,000. The loan
fund was drawn upon with the usual disregard
of consequences.
Mr. Douglas accepted the Treasurership on
Mr. M’Lean’s death ; but before Parliament
met be resigned it and left nothing for criti-
cism. The circumstances which followed and
led to the final resignation of Mr. Macalister,
need no recapitulation here, but it is necessary
to remember that Mr. Stephens was placed in
the position vacated by Mr. Douglas, and was
Colonial Treasurer nearly three months prior
to Mr. Macalister’s retirement. He had time
to prepare estimates, but, fortunately for him-
self, had not the opportunity of publishing
them. When the new Ministry was formed
Sir R. Mackenzie took the Premiership and
with it his old place as Colonial Treasurer.
In September he laid his estimates before the
Assembly.
In these estimates the Treasurer calculated
his revenue proper at £671,000, his expenditure
in chief at £671,239. He had the honesty to
own a probable deficiency. His immediate
predecessor, after nearly a week’s cogitation,
criticised bis statement in a speech almost
every sentence of whose objections contains a
condemnation of his own subsequent conduct.
The main fault ascribed was that the estimates
showed a deficiency and not a surplus, just as
if it were not far more honest to admit the
certain deficit than to depict an imaginary
excess ; but his critic did not show how either
the necessary retrenchments might be made or
the necessary income raised. Bye and bye in
February 1868, came supplementary estimates,
which utterly destroyed every chance of a
surplus. £53,801 19s was the sum asked. The
year closed with an expenditure of £745,175,
a revenue of £724,854, and a debit balance on


the general revenue account of £232,657. ex- cal Register for 1868 and the speech of the
elusive of all outstanding liabilities. How Colonial Treasurer. The debit balance as
much greater this would have been but for the
accident of the Gympie gold-fields, may be
estimated from the fact that the gold revenue
increased from £5287 in 1867 to £25,588 in
1868, nearly twenty thousand more than the
Treasurer’s estimate. The great increase in
the Customs’ receipts was mainly attributed
to the influx of adult males caused by the
gold-fields attractions. These circumstances
are deserving of especial attention, their im-
portance will be seen hereafter.
But the Mackenzie administration did not
catch the popular sympathy, and in Parlia-
ment failed to meet with what they thought
necessary support, and in November, 1868, they
resigned. Then came n series of very disre-
putable intrigues and quarrels, to which
being familiar to the public it is not necessary
to do more than refer. It was not until early
in 1869 that these difficulties being adjusted
Mr. Lilley was finally enabled to announce that
his Ministry was complete and that Mr. Ste-
phens had taken the Treasury.
The succession of Mr. Stephens to that
office was generally looked upon as heralding
a change in the management of the finances.
The public had a vague idea of great savings
to be made, and great reforms to he effected,
although in what direction no one could con-
jecture : for his Parliamentary career had
been marked by a peculiar kind of pretenti-
ousness, in which an affected reticence from
the employment of assumedly great financial
knowledge was more conspicuous than any
open display of financial wisdom. He was
methodical and industrious and a fair account-
ant. and was supposed to be well acquainted
with the circumstances of the colony. He
had for colleagues men who had been loud in
their professions of economy ; the period of
pressure had subsided and a dull monotony of
trade had succeeded ; and he had the further
advantage of preparing his first estimates
when more than two months of the year for
which they were calculated had gone by. If
ever a Treasurer succeeded to a favorable
position for the display of foresight and re-
trenchment he did. And yet this Minister,
from whom so much was expected, and who
has had so many advantages, has done nothing
but add to the catalogue of unfulfilled expec-
tations. But to apply to him what was said
of an old Chancellor of the Exchequer of
somewhat analogous qualifications a century
ago. “ lot him not be unjustly depreciated, could
he have obtained a surplus he could —have
counted it.”
When the estimates for the year 1869 were
aid before the Assembly in March of that
vear the following was the state ot the revenue
account current as collected from the Statist!-
shown on January Ist, 1869, was £232,651,
but this did not include a sum of £ll2 525
accruing for interest and due at the end of the
year, and which being paid on the Ist January
1869, was not included in the disbursements
of the preceding year, although properly be-
longing to them. That brought the actual ex-
cess of expenditure over income up to £345,177.
Mr. Stephens estimated it at £349,309, but it
is perhaps best hero to take the Auditor-
General’s certified statement of the actual
account current. This piemised, the Trea-
surer estimated his revenue for 1869 at
£786,300. or about £62,000 more than that of
1868. The expenditure including interest he
calculated at £732,826. The surplus expected
was £53,474. In accordance with precedent on
the 31st day of December, 1869, the positions
were reversed, the revenue realised only
£738.218. the expenditure was £779,188, and
the deficit instead of surplus was £40,970. If
we add that to the previous debit balance, the
total overdraft on revenue account on the Ist
January, 1870, was £386,147.
Before discussing the condition of the loan
account, it may be as well to consider from
what errors this great miscalculation of Mr.
Stephens arose. That he should deny the pos-
sibility of his being wrong, until facts forced
the unwelcome contingency upon him, was
perfectly natural. Accordingly, in July, 1869,
when making his financial statement for 1870,
he said :
“ The estimated revenue for the year 1869,
“ made in March last, was £786,300. Six
“ months of the year had now passed, and
“ with the additional light which the expe-
dience of those six months had thrown upon
“ it he did not now feel disposed to alter that
“ estimate. It apeared to his mind to be not
“ at all improbable that the full amount would
“ be reached, but he did not think there was
“ any probability of its being exceeded, and
“ there was a probability that it might not be
“ quite realised, but that probability was not
“ sufficient to justify him in altering the
“ figures He found that the
“ receipts for the first half of last year were
“ £284,573, while the receipts for the first six
“ months of the present year amounted to
“ £321,000, the receipts for the first half of the
“ present year therefore exceeded the receipts
“ for the corresponding half-year of 1868 by
“ £37,000. As he had only estimated the total
“ receipts for the year at £62,000 in excess of
“ what was actually received last year, and as
“ the first six months had produced £37,000.
“ which was considerably more than the half ot
“ £62,000 for the whole year, if the receipts for
“ the latter half of the year were in propor-
“ tion to those of the first half, it was quite


" clear that the estimated revenue would be £25,588, and the customs duties were propor*
exceeded.”(a) tionately productive. These facts are in accor-
' ' • •• i n t i • a .1 x J ~ „ 1 kiil+hnt nn orlrllfiAn
There was a good deal of dexterity, and not
a little deception —perhaps self-deception, in
all this. It was quite possible for the revenue
on the whole to be in excess for the first six
months of a previous year, and yet for a
decline in particular items to indicate a gene-
ral falling off. And it was equally possible
for the circumstances of the times to be such
as not only to render that increase exceptional,
but to ensure a corresponding reaction. Had
the Treasurer applied the elementary princi-
ples of calculating revenue to the facts before
him he would have found quite enough to jus-
tify his expecting a very serious decrease.
In estimating the revenue of a colony so
small as ours, reference must be had to the
progress of numbers and the proceeds of like
taxation in preceding years. But the average
rate per head per annum is a fallacious guide,
unless allowance is made for variations in im-
posts, and changes as well in the commodities
taxed, as in the character of the population.
Thus, for instance, in 1860 the Customs pro-
duced £2 3s 9|d per head ; in 1865, £2 8s 4d ;
in 1866, £2 8s 6|d; and in 1868, £3 4s 4^d.
It was curious to observe” said Mr. Stephens
“how little they were affected by financial
changes of the colony”; and he instanced the
slight effect he assumed to have been produced
by the depression in 1866, as a case in point.
This superficial conclusion was in accordance
with the rest of his inferences.
When we deduct the proceeds of the ad
valorem duties and take only the proceeds of
the same taxation in consecutive years, we get
a very different result, In 1865, the Customs,
having no ad valorem , yielded £2 8s 4d. In
1866, the year of depression, when, according
to Mr. Stephens, no effect should have been
perceptible, they produced £2 2s Id, a fall of
nearly thirteen per cent. In 1867, the same
duties rose again to £2 6s 7d, and in 1868 to
£2 9s 4d. In the last year there was also a
very great rise in the proceeds of the ad valo-
rem.
Looking for the cause of this rise, we find
it in the increase of the mining population—
an increase almost solely of adult males.
Thus, while during the whole of 1867, the net
male addition by immigration was only 1342,
during the first three-quarters of 1868 there
was an excess of arrivals over departures of
males of 4401. The European immigration
during the year being only 350, it follows that
the rest must have been colonial and certainly
nearly all adult males. Their destination we
know to have been the gold fields. Corres-
pondingly, the various taxes on gold, which in
1867 yielded only £5278, rose in 1868 to
(a) Hansard, 3rd Series, Vol. 9, Page 577
dance with the general rule, that an addition
to the numbers of a mining population, ac-
companied by prosperous industry, as indicated
by increased yield of the taxes on gold, affects
directly all duties upon articles of general con-
sumption, and indirectly almost every other
source of revenue. A decrease in that popu-
lation equally indicates a reduction in the pro-
ceeds of every duty affected by it —no counter-
acting circumstance existing. When, there-
fore, Mr. Stephens saw his gold exports
steadily decreasing towards the end of 1868,
and that the departures of males in the
last quarter of that year exceeded the
arrivals by 1598—nearly two-fifths of the
previous addition—he should have been pre-
pared if not for a reduction at least for
the slightest possible increase in every branch
of the public revenue. His omission of
such considerations is the more_ incom-
prehensible because, while anticipating that
his customs would remain the same as in
1868, he all the time calculated on a decrease
in his gold revenue of twenty per cent. The
actual decrease has been rather more than
twenty-seven per cent, in the gold returns, and
seven per cent, in the customs. That the falling
off should occur only in the last two quarters
of the year, was natural enough. The effect
upon revenue of diminution in consumption
is not nearly so rapid as of increase.
It will, no doubt, be said that to point out
these things now savors of the Iricism of fore-
seeing things afterwards. But the facts cited
were all patent to Mr. Stephens when, in
March, 1869, he laid his estimates before the
Assembly—still more so in July, when he
avowed his adherence to them. There was no
foresight of facts required ; thej T were exist-
ant. What was wanted was capacity to grasp
and apply them. Had that been present there
would not have been a miscalculation of
nearly £21,000 in Ihe item of Customs alone.
In his land revenue estimate the Treasurer
is not less vulnerable, and more inconsistent.
In July he, for a few moments, admitted that
there might possibly be some deduction from
the receipts anticipated in March ; but he soon
recovered himself. “Judging from the reve-
“ nue for the first six months, with the one ex-
“ ception of the auction sales of land —which
“ would be right at the end of the year —the
“ figures would certainly not justify him in
making a reduction of the estimate for this
“ year (1869.)” Happy complacency! And
why would the auction sales be ‘ right at the
end of the year ?’ Because large quantities of
land would be placed in the market. Where the
power to buy is limited an excess of supply
prevents a sale. When abstinence from imme-
diate purchase secures better terms an irtrnie-


disite sale becom> '* s an improbability. Both
these conditions w ere in operation against the
Treasurer, and botl I be ignored. For months
past the successive abandonment of runs by
lessees to their mortgagees had shown that, in
many cases the possibility of retention became
every day less impo. riant compared with the
prospect of realizat ion without heavy loss.
The influence of su ch a circumstance in
reducing the income I rom the Pastoral tenants
was not appreciated by the Treasurer. But
that the causes reft '-cred to—then existent
causes, patent to everj body—did operate, wo
may infer from the fact that instead of
£233,000, his cash land revenue only reached
£212,015,
Thus on the two prim tpal sources of income
—customs and land—on which he was most
bound to exercise all vi§ Fiance and to ensure
the greatest accuracy, tt ie Treasurer was all
abroad.
But these facts being ft o. if we turn to the
estimated revenue for 11370, what prospect
have we of realising the Treasurer’s predic-
tions ? Take bis elaborate, 1y discursive speech
of the 21st July, 1869, and what is the whole
burden of it as respects tlhe public income?
His confidence in his own p redictious and the
accuracy of his calculations for 1869, and their
consequent soundness as a ibasis. The value
of his self confidence may be judged by the
demonstrated fallaciousness o.f his calculations.
It may be asked with all propriety if there is
all y_the least—probability of the revenue of
1870 reaching nearly £70,000 more than that
of 1869? The importance of this question is
hardly to be overrated. The expenditure pro-
posed for 1870 is only £3,000 more than was
asked for in March, 1869, but £43,000 less than
was actually disbursed in that year. Expe-
rience then teaches us that a supplementary
estimate will bring our outgoings fully up to
the same level, and they must either be
met by income, or result in additional deficit.
Yet the Customs in 1869 yielded less by
£25,000 than in 1868, and by what process are
they expected to bring in £42,000 more this
year than the last, and £17,000 more than in
1868? When we remember that the great
falling off occurred in the last six months of
1869, we are justified in anticipating rather a
deficiency than a surplus in 1870. As we
have seen, the total debit to the revenue
account of the colony at the close of 1869 was
£386,147, exclusive of outstanding liabilities,
with, in all human probability, no possible
method of clearing it off, unless by a loan ex-
pressly for the purpose. When that has been
obtained, pursuing our ancient system, we
shall be free to commence fresh excesses, to
continue exceeding our revenue, and to lay
the foundation in due time for another loan.
Is this a satisfactory financial condition,
creditable to the colony, or conducive to its
welfare, in politics, in morals, or in com-
merce ?
But it may be asked, the money having been;
paid, from what.source ■dms it derived. This
question has been incidentally alluded to be-
fore, and it is now proper to afford it a more
detailed examination.
In the public accounts of this colony, there
are certain funds which are held to be and
ought to be treated as “trust funds,’’ i.e.,
monies which are entrusted to Government for
special purposes, and are not available lor the
general expenditure. Of these the Savings
Bank deposits are the principal. Then comes
the Sinking Fund, an appropriation of two per
cent, upon the annual revenue towards the re-
payment of the first Queensland loan of 1861.
The l?arliamentary Building Fund is another;
and there are minor accounts of no great
amount, “ The whole of the Trust Funds,”
said Sir R. Mackenzie in September, 1867,
“ amount t0.£172,533 ; none of that money is
in existence.” By January, 1869, the Savings
Bank deposits alone thus taken, amouted, ac-
cording to Mr. Stephens, to £250,000, and the
Sinking Fund to £58,762. These contributed
largely to the £345,000 or £349,000 to the debit
of the general revenue. A little help of £13,910
was derived from the Treasury notes issue in
excess of the reserve of coin. Where the rest
came from, Mr. Stephens’ ‘ clear and concise’
speech left to be conjectured.
The Government which initiated the prac-
tice of taking these Trust Funds for the gene-
ral expenditure of the colony initiated an
irregularity very like fraud. As respects the
Sinking Fund the language of the first Loan
Act was clear enoug'h:—“ In order to provide
“ for such repayment the said Treasurer shall
“ yearly, and every year after the year 1862,
“ until the whole shall have been repaid,
“ reserve and set apart out of the annual gene-
“ ral revenue of the colony a portion thereof
“ not less in amount than two pounds for every
“ hundred pounds of such general revenue to
“ constitute a fund to be applied in the repay-
“ ment of such sums as, and when the same,
“ may become due and payable.” Regularly
and in every return from the Auditor-General
published in successive statistical registers
appears the item in the details of expenditure,
“ Sinking Fund on revenue for 186—” so much.
Not only was the intention of the Legislature
clear, but the compliance of the Executive
with it was made to be apparent in the offi-
cial returns. And all the while the intention
was set at nought, and the apparent compli-
ance a trumpery evasion. The Sinking Fund
became and is a shadow of figures which if
it resolves itself into anything, will resolve
itself into perpetual debt.
The Savings Bank appropriation is still


worse. Sir R. Mackenzie, with; that curious
obliquity of perception which is so convenient,
and so characteristic of the Queensland Trea-
sury, affirmed in September, 1867, that “the
“ first item—the Savings Bank—was a legiti-
“ mate sum to borrow. It was intended that
“ these deposits should be made use of. But”
said he “ I think when the government borrow
“ money they should put debentures for a cor-
“ responding amount to the credit of the fund,
“ and I shall endeavor to see this done.”(a)
It was intended ! By whom ? What says
the Savings Bank Act ? “ All monies so
“ deposited shall forthwith be carried to such
“ account as the Governor, with the advice of
“ the Executive Council, may direct; and all
“ sums withdrawn by depositors or parties
“ legally authorised to claim on account of
“ depositors, shall be repaid to them out of the
“ said monies .” And, as an additional security
to the depositors, any deficiency is authorised
to be made good out of the consolidated
revenue; and depositors are entitled to repay-
ment by return of post after demand made.
In what way these provisions point to the
handling of the deposits by the Government
for the gener-al expenditure of the colony it
requires a curiously constructed vision to see.
And where is the record of the manner in, or
the time at, which Parliament (or even the
depositors) were apprised of, and made a party
to, the assumed intention ? No inkling of the
real state of the facts appears in any official
statement included in the Auditor-General’s
returns. On the contrary, in the abstract of
the Savings Bank Balance Sheet for the year
ending 31st December, 1866. signed W. L. G.
Drew, Under Secretary, and published in the
statistical register for the same year, the follow-
ing item appears. “ Amount to the credit of
Saving’s Bank in the Union Bank, including
interest to 31st December at 6 per cent*
£72,537 2s 7d.” Sir E. Mackenzie tells us in
1867 that none of that money was in existence.
In the statement of liabilities and assets of the
Queensland Government Savings Bank for the
year ending 31st December, 1868, signed “ W.
L. G. Drew, Under Secretary,” among the
assets is the following:—“Amount at the credit
of Savings Bank in Union Bank of Australia,
including interest to 3lst December, 1868,
£207,545 12s 5d.” Mr. T. B. Stephens, in July,
1869, gives us to understand that this was all
a myth ; the money was gone and the replacing
it somehow or other was one of the matters
vhich “required to be dealt with imme-
liately.” There was, in fact, neither the
lepositors’ cash nor any security to represent
;hem. This jugglery with accounts throws
liscredit upon the whole system. Why not at
>nce have told the public that the Government
fa) Borrowing here is marvellously like taking without
leave, and the endeavor remained an endeavor.
had taken the money and owed it? Why!—-
Because that would have been straightforward;
whereas, the fact is, that when these monies
were first taken it was hoped that they might
have been replaced, and no one outside the
official doors have been one whit the wiser.
It is not contended here that the money of
the depositors or of the Sinking Fund will not
be ultimately safe, but that its safety is not in
the form or on the guarantees intended and
prescribed by the legislature. The safety now
depends upon the solvency of the colony for
the time. The legislative methods of seem ing
it against even insolvency as far as possible have
been set on one side. For a deposit in, or equi-
valent to, cash has been substituted—firstly
no security at all, and at last one of credit.
Admit the precedent and there is an end of the
honest exposition of the public accounts, and
of direct legislative control over the public
expenditure. Were the right of the Govern-
ment thus to take the ‘ trust funds’ of the
colony and apply them as they thought fit,
without direct parliamentary authority, once
conceded, then the annual specialty of votes of
supply is only a foolish act in a delusive farce,
and the Acts by which they are legalised so
many sheets of blotted parchment. The
whole history of these transactions is one of
mystification of accounts, of mis-statement
of facts, and of mis-appropriation of funds—
thoroughly disgraceful to all who initiated and
all who have participated in them.
But to return from this discussion—which,
however, could not well have been omitted—
the Treasurer found that, in addition to the
£345,000 or £349,000 excess of expenditure
over income, he had other claims to meet.
The Treasury bills ( a ) of 1866 fell due on 31st
December. This required £300,000. Excess of
railway expenditure over loans voted called for
£115,528, and £31,478 was wanted to repay ad-
vances on and continue the works on the Par-
liamentary buildings. Besides this, the bottom-
less pit of contracts not yet completed yawned
for £221,131, and there was a deficiency in the
amount realised by the debentures, as against
the amount authorised and required to bo
raised, of £209,977. “It was necessary to
“ raise £350.000 to cover the whole of the defi-
“ ciency in the revenue account, and £579,114
“ to cover the loss on sale of debentures, for
“ works already constructed, and to complete
“ contracts already entered into.” Thus, then,
vve at length get an acknowledged indebted-
ness ot £929,114, in addition to £3,021,186 for
debentures said to be already issued. The
total debt admitted on the Ist January. 1869,
was £3,950.300(5). The Treasurer’s mode of
fa) “Tobe repaid,” as the official accounts monoto-
nously say.
(b) But see p. 13


providing for the £929,114 was highly charac-
teristic.
It mattered not a straw in what colored inks
the different items of debt were written in the
Treasury books, the whole formed a debt, and
if he had to borrow for its payment, it was
simply a consolidation in an acknowledged
form.ol what before existed in a number of
items formally unacknowledged. But, said
the Treasurer, you must, on no account, issue
debentures to meet the excess of expenditure,
but you must issue them to meet Treasury
bills now falling due, and then you must issue
fresh Treasury Bills to meet the excess.
Was there ever more absurd financial thimble-
rigging? Disguise it as he might.no small
portion of his proposed loan was wanted to
replace monies that had been taken and ought
not to have been taken to provide for expen-
diture which ought not to have been expended.
Did he really suppose that the astute home
financiers would not see at once that the whole
scheme was neither more nor less than one of
shifting the form of indebtedness ? Whether
he paid the Treasury bills by fresh bills at a
lower rate or by long-dated debentures, he was
renewing the debt; whether he substituted
Treasury bills or debentures for the Saving’s
Bank deposits and the sinking fund he was
renewing the debt. And when it was not
simple renewal —as in the latter case—it was
borrowing openly at last to cover what had
been secretly taken by trick and evasion
before. As to the credit of the colony it did
not matter whether Treasury Bills went to
pay Treasury bills and debentures to pay
overdraft, or debentures to pay Treasury bills
and Treasury bills to pay overdraft, for both
were authorised at the same time. The fact
of having to borrow for such purposes at all
was the material one, and that, unfortunately,
was beyond doubt. What seems equally
beyond doubt, since the last year’s revenue
returns, is, that the Treasury bills will not
cover the overdraft, and will require more de-
bentures to meet them when they fall due.
It is unnecessary to contrast the promise of
the new Treasurer with his performances. The
results of his administration are simply these.
The revenue has fallen far short of his antici-
pations and far short of his expenditure, and
in his loan adjustment he has postponed all
he could, and settled almost nothing. It is
high time to look fuither a-field. Treasurer
after Treasurer has left the finances of the
colony worse than he found them; and the last
emulates the least fortunate of his predeces-
Recapitulating the results of the financial
administration of this colony as respects its
revenue and ordinary expenditure, we find
them as follows: —
Surplus Deficit
1859 (a) £2,213 12 11
1860 .. £17,186 3 2
1861 16,941 15 6
1862 21,740 2 2
1863 49,648 2 10
1864 (5) 70.743 16 4
1865 (c) 893 6 10
1866 111,458 4 4
1867 50,835 3 0
1868 17,317 16 7
1869 40,970 0 0
The average deficit on the ten years being
nearly thirty-seven thousand a year, and on
the last four fifty-five thousand.
The loan transactions of the colony are so
complicated by technicalities in the Auditor-
General's statements that it is not easy to
eliminate a plain account for the general
reader, But, divested of their surroundings,
they present the following results
The total amount of loans authorised in
1861, 3,4, and 6, exclusive of Treasury Bills
amounted to £3,021,186. A heavy loss, and
the charges accruing upon the sales— amount-
ing to nearly seven per cent, upon the whole—•
reduced the anticipated proceeds, and to meet
this another £lOO,OOO of what were termed
depreciation debentures were issued, ( d ) the
Government assuming that whatever might
be the prices realised by the security, they
were authorised to go on with the issue until
the amount required was obtained. The posi-
tion of the loan on the 31st December, 1868,
as respects the sales of debentures will be
readily understood from this statement: —
Amount authorised to be issued
i„ all £3,121,186
Less debentures in hand, .. 67,500
Total sales £3,053,686
Proceeds of sales .. ... £2,899,369 5 3
Loss on Sales .. .. 154,316 14 9
Total £3,053,686 0 0
The expenditure on the Loan Fund like that
of the general revenue, was beyond the origi-
nal estimate, and thence arose the necessity
for the first Treasury Bills for £300,000 autho-
rised in 1866. The general statement of re-
ceipts and disbursement stands thus ;
Proceeds of sales, £2,899,369, 5 3

of the loan.

The Treasury Bills realising £298,671 17s 8d
a balance of £88,031 13s lid in the
hands of the Government on the 31st Dec.,
1868, of which £67,500 were in unsold deben-
tures. Thus it would seem that the total debt
of the colony on the Ist January, 1869, includ-
ing interest due, was as follows—exclusive of
contracts and balances unprovided for:—
Debit balance of the Revenue
account £345,177
Debentures sold .. .. .. 3,053,686
Treasury Bills 300,000
Total £3,698,863
But this does not include £138,500 Treasury
Bills in circulation(a) on account of the note
issue branch, which would bring the amount
up to £3,837,363. Including these bills in
circulation as a liability the actual Loan Debt
assumes this shape;—
Debentures and Treasury Bills

New Loan £928,446
Less replacement of
£300,000 Treasury
Bills, 300,000 £628,446
£4,120.632 (b)
(o) This item seems of a peculiar kind. The balance of
the £138,500 after deducting the sum expended in the
purchase of coin under the Treasury Notes Act, appears
nowhere in the revenue statements for iB6O, 7, or 8, or in
the statement of loan receipts in the Register for 1868.
The amount expended in the purchase of coin is not more
than £15,000, where have the other £123,500 gone to ?
The bills are in circulation, where is the money, and where
is the account of its application. From the Registers for
iB6O and 1867, it appears that the Treasurer has a floating
draft on the note issue branch “ to defray authorised expen-
ditures”of about £160,000, but there is no statement beyond
this, and curiously enough the “ Return of the liabilities and
assets of the note issue branch of the Treasury” is omitted
in the Register for 1868. If the Treasurer has the use of
this large sum, the manner of its application should ap-
pear in the annual accounts.
(b) The Treasurer made it £3,949,609. (See Hansard
21st July, 1869.) He seems to have forgotten the depreci-
ation debentures, the £138,500 Treasury Bills, and the
unsold debentures. The following adjustment shows how
those forgotten items affect the real account:—
Treasurer’s assumed d ebt £3,949,609
Treasury Bills £138,500
Depreciation debentures less
balance in hand 32,500 171,000
Total £4,120,609
Close enough to ghowjthe correctness of the result given
in the text, and the incorrectness of Mr. Stephens. But
an error of £171,000 is not much to an infallible Trea-
surer. His boasted financial operation resolves itself into
this: there was £221,132 of balances falling due on con-
tracts, deduct £67,500 of unsold debentures and £150,000
Undoubtedly since the Ist January, 1869,
the £67,500 debentures then on hand have
gone, and we have the £40,970 deficit of 1869
in addition. Thus, on the Ist of January of
this year, the indebtedness of the colony not
including outstanding claims and balances on
contracts yet unascertained, was £4,229,102.
The expenditure of the large loan proceeds,
has been mainly on a few items. Railways
must have swallowed up nearly two millions
andahalf; Immigration, not including the
£70.603 illegally transferred to the revenue
account, about £330,000; Harbor Works,
£170,000(a); Electric Telegraphs, £92,000;
Ordinary Public Works, not including
£43,500 towards the Parliament Houses,
£106,000; Roads and Bridges, £86,000; Bris-
bane Water Works, £65,000 ; and some minor
items have absorbed the rest. The history of
these expenditures has yet to be written.
And these are the results of ten years’ res-
ponsible Government. A debt of £4,229,102,
a yearly interest of £259,166, a yearly average
deficit of over £50,000, and all with a popula-
tion of about 110,000 to bear it. The mone-
tary aspect of affairs is bad enough; but it is
rendered worse by the unblushing violation
of law, the trickery, the evasion, and the reck-
lessness which have combined to produce it.
Unless, indeed, some stringent precautions are
taken against their recurrence, it is questiona-
ble whether a return of prosperity would not
afford an outlet for fresh profusion and repeated
disaster.
The first dutv of the financier in such a
dilemma is to equalize his income and expen-
diture. His second is to so settle the loan and
deal with the public revenue as to prevent the
one from growing to larger dimensions, and
the other from being any more tampered with.
There are difficulties in the way of both, but
difficulties which if the state is not to become
hopelessly insolvent must be overcome.
It is of course Useless to think of further
taxation. We have already seen that taxation
has produced all it is rightfully capable of.
Additional imposts will only lead to decreased
consumption, or the driving people out of
Queensland: for already we are more heavily
taxed in proportion to numbers than any other
Australian colony, and the effect of this burden
is pressing hardly upon every industry we
have. It follows, therefore, that to retrench-
ment we must look as the source whence the
desired equalization is to be obtained. And
in truth there is good ground for its advo*
new loan would cover the remainder. All the rest was
simply shifting of debentures for Treasury Bills, and Trea-
sury Bills for abstracted deposits and Trust Funds, and
for overdrafts; and this simple matter took three hours of
‘ clear and concise’ (vide Mr. Lilley) speaking to twist into
half a dozen different forms and explanations.

reduction which would crush the lower classes
if the civil service, while their superiors would
jnly have to forego a few luxuries, but that
lessening of numbers which would he quite
iompatible with increased efficiency in the
lepartments,(6) and that pruning of salaries
to an accordance with the pressure of the
times, which would not be unjust to those who
ire paid, and would be only just to those who
pay- „ ,
When we examine in detail the cost of col-
lecting the revenue as compared with the
amount returned, it will not be difficult to see
where expenditure has been unprofitable or
management inefficient. Take the following
table for 1869 :
Income. Cost.
Harbor Dues, .. 5,621 16,171*
Tost Office, .. 20,834 12,018 (f)
Electric Telegraph, 11,673 16,073
Thus the Customs may be said to cost about
5 per cent.; the Excise nearly 15 ; the Land
20; Railways more than 80; gold about 10;
Harbor Dues nearly 300: Post Office nearly
60; and Electric Telegraph about 150. Again,
the Colonial Secretary’s department which
collects hardly anything, cost £180,855, of
which £124,000 comes directly under that
Minister’s control. The administration of
justice cost £17,411 in 1869, and only £14,942
in 1868. Electric telegraphs produced an in-
crease of £5OO, and cost £2,100 more. Leaving
the customs as conducted at a reasonable cost,
the others require investigation. That in some
cases by judicious management revenue could
be increased, and in others expenditure di-
minished, can scarcely admit of a doubt. Nor
is it at all unlikely that consolidation would
produce both economy and efficiency. Why is
(а) The following is worth reflecting upon. The popu-
lation of New South Wales including what has since be-
come Queensland was, in 1850 about 160,000, the expendi-
ture, exclusive of works, roads, and bridges, was about
£218,000. Our population in iB6O was about two-thirds
of that of N. S, Wales in 1850 and our expenditure for
strictly analogous objects close on £420,000, or nearly
twice as much as theirs. Among the blessings of Par-
liamentary Government, economy cannot be said to be in-
cluded.
(б) In 1860 there were 234 names on (he civil list, in
1868, 854. The latter is exclusive of ordinary policemen,
laborers, boatmen, and other subordinates, and zvithout
them probably one in fifty of the adult male popuatiou.
(c) Exclusive of Geologic survey, gardens, &c.
(d) Exclusive of interest, £135,000 more; and presum-
ing no really current charge to bo placed to loan.
(c) But not more than one third fairly chargeable to
collection.
(/) Exclusive of conveyance of mails, £37,147.
there any greater need of a Minister for Lands
and a Minister for Works now, than there was
when the railway works were in full operation,
and the pastoral occupation growing year by
year beyond expectation and almost beyond
control? One Minister sufficed then, why
want two now ?
Again, there is argument for reduction of
salaries in the general reduction of profits.
While every professional, mercantile, trading,
or mechanic, member of the community has
suffered from the times, the state like a mag-
nificent milch cow has enlarged her benevo-
lence with the number of applicants, and each
receives the accustomed supply. Surely in her
distress the well paid civil servants may be
told that they must moderate their desires.
The Statistical Register of the colony for 1868
gives a sum of nearly £91,000 per annum paid
in salaries commencing at £250 and ranging
up to £lOOO, exclusive of the judges and two
or three professional men. It would be only
fair that a per centage of reduction, ranging
from 5 per cent, on the lower sums to 10 per
cent, on the higher ones of these should be
made. A saving of nearly £7OOO a year would
result. Below £250 it would be injudicious
to go. , .
Reverting again to the items of cost in
realizing the revenue, on the Excise, Land,
Railways, Harbor Dues, Post Office, and Elec-
tric Telegraphs, and the disbursements in the
Colonial Secretary’s office, and for the Admin-
istration of Justice, the total sum involved is
nearly £320,000. The reduction of the higher
salaries would affect some of the employes in
each of these departments, but still compara-
tively few. But when salaries may not be re-
duced efficiency may be increased, A civil
servant needlessly employed is a loss two ways
to the country. His labor contributes nothing
to its wealth, and his payment is a burden
upon it. If a right estimate of the work were
taken, and the service knew they must do it
or go, it would be done. To this end every
energy should be devoted to consolidation.
It would take too much space here to show in
detail where consolidation could be effected,
salaries saved, and retrenchment made, but it
is not too ranch to say that the expenditure
could be reduced at least £15,000 per annum,
in addition to the £7,000 already specified.
"I always make my womankind pay ready
money,’* said ungallant Paley,
“ it’s such a check on the imagination.” Were
the principle involved applied to the Public
Works department, not a little saving would
result. More than £31,000 was expended last
year in roads and bridges, necessarily with
scant supervision and the minimum of econo-
my in either time or labor. Let local assess-
ment be a condition precedent to Government
aid, and leave the work to local supervision.


Our roads and bridges are simple enough, and
many of the settlers and small farmers know
better what is wanted and would do it better
than the “department.” Men look sharply
after what they want to use themselves. The
experience of Victoria showed that the cost of
the roads fell one-half after the introduction of
local Road Boards, while the burden to the
revenue was lessened and the utility of the
work immeasurably increased. Were this
principle adopted, half the cost of both con-
struction and department would disappear from
the expenditure. Another £15,000 would bo
saved here.
There is another matter in which, although
no real retrenchment will be made, real relief
will be afforded. A state sinking fund has
long since been proved to be a state absurdity,
and a Queensland sinking fund the most absurd
of its class; (a) for it has simply settled down
into a deposit of new debentures under pre-
tence of paying off the old ones. Were fresh
stock at a long date issued by way of exchange
for the old terminable debentures, the raising
of £16,000 a year—nominally to repay a debt,
but really to increase it —would cease. The
preference given to long-dated debentures over
loans for short periods is too well known to re-
quire enlarging upon, and the facility of the
exchange is readily apparent.
It is not pretended that the foregoing sug-
gestions indicate all that can be saved, or the
best method of saving in every instance. It
is probable that those who are intimately
acquainted with the inner working of the civil
service system might be able to exhibit an
economy superior in direction as well as in
amount. But there is nothing in what has
been set forth that a very ordinary administra
tion might not easily attempt, and, with no
great difficulty and a little firmness, carry out.
The present Ministry, not being an ordinary
administration, will probably deem the subject
unworthy of notice, although the proposed
reductions in the disbursements amount alto-
gether to £53,000 per annum.
The ultimate settlement of the loan will
necessarily be the conversion of Treasury bills
and every other outstanding form of debt into
debentures, and the consolidation of the various
loans into stock; It could not but be the aim
of a sound financier to bring his different loans
under one kind, so that the liability would be
concentrated and easily understood. The evil
of different loans on different kinds of secu-
rities is evident in the miscalculation and mis-
statements which have been corrected when
treating of the debt.
(a) Thus we pay G per cent, on the first loan of 1861,
If we apply the Sinking Fund to repurchase those de-
bentures, we directly heighten their price and thus repay
more than we borrowed. If we keep the money waiting
then we lose the current interest on that as well as pay
the agreed interest on the loan.
There would, however, be a slight increase
of debentures required to place the Savings
Bank in a satisfactory condition, and that|
condition will have to be guaranteed by 1
special legislation. It is dangerous to leave
the slightest chance of difficulty in repaying
the deposits; and in the face of past proceedure
it would be both foolish and criminal to expose
those deposits to any future risk of unautho-
rised handling. Provision should be made that
no loan should be taken from the Savings
Bank funds without a special vote of the
Assembly, and then only on the deposit of
debentures or Treasury bills to an amount
equal to £133 for every £lOO borrowed, and
past abstractions should be covered in like
manner. Thus risk from depreciation or diffi-
culty of realising would be guarded against.
The increase to the general liability in this
case would be contingent rather than real.
That the custody of both monies and deben-
tures might be made what it is not now—
secure—the Savings Bank should be separated
from the Treasury, and an independent board
of trustees, nominated by statute from amongst
the highest authorities in the state, and
removable only on defined statutary disqualifi-
cation, should be constituted, and charged with
that duty. Let it be remembered that in tho
short space of six years the deposits have in-
creased from twenty-seven thousands of
pounds to upwards of a quarter of a million,
and are yet increasing, and the propriety of
providing special protection for their security
will appear not less essential to the safety of
the owners than to the welfare of the state.
Danger to such an institution is menace to the
community.
But no retrenchment would be reliable, and
no settlement secure, without the adoption of
a very different method from that which has
hitherto obtained of dealing with the supplies
voted by Parliament. The supposed guards of
the Audit Act are mere cobwebs, through
which any Ministerial butterfly can break his
way. Where was its value when the Savings
Bank deposits and the Sinking Fund were
taken? Where when the bulk of an Immi-
gration loan was swept off to supply a defi-
ciency in the general revenue ? Where when
a mere Executive minute sufficed for the trans-
fer of thousands of pounds backward and for-
ward, in defiance of the appropriation made
by Parliament, and as the necessity or the
whim of a Minister might dictate.(a) The
whole financial history of the last seven years
is a record of systematic violation, not merely
of the constitutional precedents set us by the
Government whence ours has spruug, but of
the very purport and terms of the Acts by
(a) The Ipswich and Dalby and Warwick votes liavi
furnished very convenient sums for this sort of manipula
tion.


which the public monies have been provided
and directed to be applied. It may with truth
be affirmed, that in Queensland Ministers have
been permitted to do almost unchallenged,
what dare not in Great Britain be attempted
by any administration, even though backed by
the whole weight of a proud hereditary
peerage, and the direct prestige and over-
powering influence of the Crown. Where
is the Minister at home who dare vary the
application of a special vote of the House
■of Commons, or lay hands on the savings of
the people without deigning to inform much
less to ask leave of their representatives? The
very core of the great British system of pro-
tection against arbitrary taxation—that legacy
of centuries of conflict, and suffering, and en-
durance —is comprised in these few words, —
that the sovereign shall not use the subject’s
money without his consent. What the Sover-
eign of the Empire may not do, no half dozen
of men accidently jumbled into a Colonial
Executive should be permitted to have done.
The Audit Act, as has been said, is ineffec-
tive, and how far its administration has been
sometimes negligent, sometimes obsequious,
and sometimes inoperative, is fit matter for
Parliamentary inquiry. That the Act itself
requires remodeling, and the duties it imposes
more stringently enforcing, is clear enough.
No Executive Minute should be allowed to
interfere with the direct vote of the Assembly,
and no expenditure should be permitted be-
yond that which such a vote sanctions. The
Auditor-General should be reminded that he is
no part of the Executive Government, and has
no duty in common with theirs. He is the
watchman of Parliament, to see that the Exe-
cutive fulfil and do not go beyond its behests
—not the convenience of a Governor or the
instrument of his Ministers. The farce of re-
turning a voucher as merely “ unauthorised
expenditure,” to be dealt with as the Treasury
think fit, is one which cannot be longer toler-
ated. The duty of the Auditor-General should
be to reject the voucher in toto; to minute its
purport; and to lay the whole particulars be-
fore Parliament in his annual return. And
that he might commit no error, the detailed
votes as passed through the committee of the
Assembly, and not a mere summary of depart-
ments, should be scheduled with and form part
of the Appropriation Act of every year. That
done —the road of expenditure made so plain
that a child might walk therein hold the
rod of personal responsibility over the Minis-
ter who itches to go outside its boundaries.
There will then be an end of contracts
before Parliament hears even of the proposal
for them, and of outlay upon objects which
Parliament never contemplated, and were first
told of when informed that the money had
been spent and had to be voted. Treasurers
may indeed then require to be more guarded
in their estimates. They may perhaps be less
easily found. So much the better. They will
be all the more efficient when they are got.
The finances of the colony will be dealt with
by statesmen, instead of furnishing an experi-
ment box for the head of a department.
All this may be thought harsh, but is harsh
only by comparison with the reprehensible
laxity that has hitherto prevailed. Respon-
sible government! Responsible for what ?
For the due performance of the several func-
tions entrusted to it. Is that responsibility
heightened by a clear definition of its nature,
and the prevention of mistake as to its
extent? The man who objects'to either must
be wanting in common sense; he quarrels
with his own best protection. And he who so
misapprehends the very spirit of our constitu-
tion as to desire irresponsibility, either directly
by consent or indirectly by uncertainty, for
any member of any administration, is not fit
to bo a constitutional minister himself.
Claimed in one direction, it may be extended
in another ; and the power of the purse is too
closely allied with the liberty of the subject to
admit of either being tampered with without
danger tojboth.
There remains one question—that of further
loans. In a colony which ought to be progres-
sive there may be occasions to draw upon the
future, to hasten the advantages which that
future is presumed to have in store. And
there is a very general idea that by the borrow-
ing of capital for railways employment will be
provided for the laboring classes, _ and _ the
whole colony enriched. But there is a limit
to the power of borrowing, which it is unwise
to challenge. Colonial loans are guaged more
by the capacity of the borrower to pay the
interest than by reference to the safety of the
principal. That, in a British colony, must be
secure. But what hope of paying interest on
a new loan can there be when that upon the
present one is the cause of an annual and in-
creasing deficit. In the first place, is it honest
to ask for a further loan when we are at our
wit’s end to raise enough to pay for the use of
the money we have already borrowed. In the
second is it clear that the public creditor is
not as*shaip-sighted as his would-be customer,
and consequently likely to refuse fresh
advances unless at a heavy discount. And
lastly, would a new loan perma-
nent benefit which is claimed for it.
The two first questions every one can
answer for himself. The third requires a
short examination.
To employ labor only for the sake of giving
employment to the actual laborers is a waste.
Productive labor in some form is indispensable.
But even productivel£labor may equally be
wasted if more of it be expended than really


conduces to production. It may render a na-
tion poorer if the increase it makes in useful
or agreeable things be of a kind not immedi-
ately wanted. “ The bankrupt States of North
America, with their premature railways and
canals, have made this kind of mistake.”(a)
The result of the employment of a number of
men on public works, which for years to come
would produce an insufficient revenue, or no
revenue, to meet the outlay upon them, would
be the temporary benefit of the persons em-
ployed, and the permanent damage of every
body else in the community. Thus the ques-
tion becomes one of very great importance to
the whole of the industrial and producing
classes not engaged in those employments
which public works would call into activity;
and those classes form the great bulk of the
working population.
The inquiry whether such works are imme-
diately necessary, or will become remunerative
when completed, may in the first instance be
remitted to the localities in which they are
said to be required. Will the inhabitants con-
tribute, and to what extent, or are there local
means other than by direct taxation for the pur-
pose available? Where none of these are
forthcoming, it is clear that an exceedingly
good case must be made out before the inhabi-
tants of other places not directly interested in
the proposed works, and not likely to be be-
nefited by them, can with justice be called
upon to bear any portion of the burdens they
may entail. The propriety of giving the
general guarantee of the state for the benefit
of a section is open to doubt under most cir-
cumstances; but still more is it so open when
the priority allowed to a particular district in
effect postpones or prevents the possession of
equal advantages by the rest.
If indeed the principle before hinted at of
insistance on primary local contribution, or
assessment, as a condition precedent to a state
loan or a state guarantee for local public works,
were generally applied, there would be a ter-
mination to general loans with interest secured
upon the general revenue. This would act
beneficially in two ways. It would operate as
a check upon extravagant or premature outlay,
and it would assist in the process of liquida-
tion. Were our present loans consolidated into
one stock, with a guarantee that it should con-
stitute a first charge upon the general revenue,
the way would be open for their conversion
into five per cents.—an operation which al-
though it might involve some apparent present
loss, would result in a diminution of nearly
twenty-three thousand per annum in our annual
burden. This again would open the way for a
(a) See Mill —Book 1; chap. 3 ; sec. 4.
reduction of our taxes—always of the highest
importance to a colony depending for rapid
progress upon a full and continuous stream of
immigration.
But leaving the subject for more careful dis-
cussion at a future opportunity, it is surely
indispensable that the old system of voting
loans in a lump without reference to the de-
tails of their appropriation should continue no
longer, A loan is nothing more than deferred
taxation, and there is no valid reason why its
expenditure should not be subject to the same
checks and provisions as that of the ordinary
revenue. This would necessitate a previous
inquiry into the necessity for, and the adequacy
and method of, the proposed outlay, of which
we have hitherto had no example. And if one
caution more than another is necessary the
absolute prohibition of the commencement of
of contracts before their approval by Parlia-
ment—unless within the terms of a previous
sanction —is that one. The procedure sug-
gested is only analagous to that pursued in
the arrangement of the ordinary expenditure
of the country. Parliament votes a supply;
but Parliament is, or is supposed to be, parti-
cularly careful in its application. The autho-
rizing an ad valorem duty does not at all imply
that its proceeds shall be expended until the
Legislature has said in what manner, and
when.
It is unnecessary to detain the reader longer.
The sum of the whole matter is short. We
have had extravagance resulting from negli-
gence ; we want economy springing from fore-
thought. We have seen the necessities of a
system which recognised the expediency of the
day as its principal guide, peril the very sol-
vency of the state; we want to return to the
safe guidance and solid protection of constitu-
tional usage and the written law which follows
from it. If by thus acting we can restore order
to the public finances, give relief to commerce,
energy to trade, and prosperity to all, it is a
pity to delay looking our difficulties in the
face. It is not desired that the statements
made in this brief recapitulation shall be taken
for granted. Search and see if the things said
be true. The sources of information are com-
mon to all. The labor of collection and com-
parison should be thought lightly of when the
importance of the subject is considered. And
there is need of the work.
In all probability the old cry of damage to
the colony, of depreciation of its resources, of
needless alarm at its condition, may be raised
against those who, knowing the truth of the
facts related, lay them before the public.
Such accusations will not cause their objects
a moment’s uneasiness. No community ever
suffered half so much damage from knowing
its real condition as from living in a false para-


dise of imaginary wealth. The resources of lications should stimulate such an investiga-
the colony art magnificent—its means of pros- tion, and aid, however feebly, in pointing out a
perity almost boundless I So much the greater remedy for some of the evils under which the
the necessity for enquiring why the employ- colony admittedly suffers, their issue need not
ment of so great possessions has produced be regretted, and they will not have been
depression, debt, and difficulty. If these pub- written in vain.
