|{N the language of the yellowbacks and iambic prose
of young ladies’ journals, the gilded car of day
is sinking in the west, and eucalypti shadows
lengthen on the grass. The budding wattle and
sheen top of Warrenheip arrest the glinting rays,
and all animated Nature is silent, save the jackass
on the pliant bough, and the yelping dingo, chasing
long-tailed marsupials over the virgin bosom of Black
Hill and down the fattening sides of unborn Eureka.
Then as the Western Hills and the Peereck Range
(Pyrenees) bar the pencilled rays of the setting
sun, cooling zephyrs send their fragrant argosies
through primal wood, sylvan dell, and o’er the
limpid Yarrowee, murmuring in its auriferous
bed, awaking Apollo’s accordant lyre and Nature’s
subtle harmonies, inviting even the drowsy bear
to seek its lofty lair, the Eden-cursed
snake its hole,


pool, the tired cub its dam, and —and so on, responsive
“ . . . . to the gentle lullaby
That through the trees is creeping !
Those sleepy trees, that nod their heads
Ere the moon as yet conies peeping,
Like a tender nurse, to see if all
Her little ones are sleeping.”

In the glade (White Flat) the curling smoke and
smell of roast wallaby ascend. Around the white
fire-ash circles a group of aborigines, mostly clad in
primeval innocence, feathery coronets, fat, and rouge ,
all garrulous and amaze over the coming change—the
reversal of their cherished tribal customs, cannibalistic
and brutish ways—to be effected by the colonising
mission of the Anglo-Saxon, whose exploring con-
tingent from Geelong had reached the vicinity of
Ballarat (resting-place) that very day in August, and,
strange to say, in the accession year of Our Gracious
Majesty, and of grace 1837, in the persons of Thomas
Livingstone Learmonth, Henry Anderson, D’Arcy,
Dr. Alex. Thomson, and others.
Then William, the lithe black king of the Ballarat
tribe, addresses the enterprising new chums —
Tradition, long back ages dead, did say,
Across the big blue sea a pale-faced race
Adventurous, impetuous, and free,
Would come in ships, with spreading sail and flag,
Allured by wealth, emprise, and fame,
The colonisers rejoin:—“Billy, le Eoi, that presage




caninnies—a horrid practice, hardly ever found
out in Christian parts ! Your gin slavishly
s digs up starchy roots with the muwrang-pole , and
gathers the white sjiail for food, rubs fire-sticks, and
makes the dome-shaped wurley; but our gin rears
strong palatial edifices, where some people, at others’
expense, sooner end their days, freed from such
domestic duties. You keep the Ten Commandments
—backwards, and practise polygamy, and are in this
regard in shameful contrast to the Latter-day Saints
of Salt Lake City. Your unpardonable ignorance of
the Golden Fleece is as pronounced as is the activity
of the vermin which try to accommodate themselves
in your scanty attire. You are great in fantasies,
weather forecasts, trails, carousals, and grunting
corroborees. You know nothing of the Babes in the
Wood, but you do a lot about those in the stone
oven; thus practically illustrating the culinary theory
of the Yen. Dean Swift, ‘that a young healthy child,
well nursed, is, at a year old, most delicious, nourish-
ing, and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted,
baked, or boiled, and will serve in a ragout. A child
will make two dishes at an entertainment for friends,
and when the family dines alone, the fore or hind
quarter will make a reasonable dish.’ Having now,
like Priam’s son, hectored you, and contrasted your
social nothingness to our anpient and modern
domestic and political ethics, we invite you to
reciprocate, sketching your local topography,
history, and other customs.”
Then following indissoluble fate, and ascend-




with their browsing kangaroo and fleety emu ; while
further away, are Naringook (Smythes), Kurnum
(Carngham), Ganing-gering (Chepstowe), Calemheen
(Creswick), Brawell (Miners’ Best), Woran (Skipton),
and Piggoreet—spots alive with the snarling dingo,
root-eating bandicoot, mallee-hen, flying-squirrel,
mopoke, and ‘the sacred crow and bat.’ Our origin
is lost in darkness. Most tribes have no idea of a
Supreme Being, nor how anything was first made.
We are anti-spiritists, and therefore dread the prowl-
ing demons, phantoms, and ghosts, which make us
fear the morkalla (night). The manes of our race
(continues the sable King) fly towards the setting
sun, and some are resurrectionized, and “ by and
by jump up white man.” Corpses, accompanied by
wailings of friends, and their self-inflicted lacerations
and burnings, are by certain tribes hid away in
hollow trees, in running streams, cremated, and
some of their ashes carried about by the tribe. Oc-
casionally the body is laid in a cave or on branches
of a tree, on a raised platform, or buried in the
narrow trench for three moons or so, and then un-
earthed, to have some of its bones scraped and hung
up as a souvenir in the miam of the deceased. Death is
mostly attributed to, and regarded as the effect of,
witchcraft, exercised by some keern (rascal) of some
adjacent tribe, and ought to be, and is where
possible, revenged by taking a life for a life,
‘ And Blood for Blood—the simple golden rule
Taught hy the elder gods,’
either by stratagem or in open fight. The where-


abouts of the sorcerer is discovered by a bending straw
stuck loosely in a hole near the dead body, or by noting
the direction the first ant or maggot takes, and the first
man met is the culprit. There is a charm and virtue
in eating or lubricating oneself with the fat of emu or
of a dead man’s kidney, or by eating a part of his
skin ; while some, in memoriam, hang around the neck
a cut-off hand. The birth of a piccaninny is a great
and ko-ki (pleasing) event in our lubra’s leafy
and bark-made miam (as was Mrs. Artemus Ward’s
twins). The father dangles the little mottled darky,
and our girls vie with each other for that
opportunity (after the manner, ’tis said, of fair
damsels of cultivated nations). If births are
inconveniently frequent, that inconvenience is some-
times removed by the mother simply killing the
new-born infant, and that too on principles recognised
by women and winked at by us men. Occasionally,
a female child, soon after birth, is betrothed to some
notable man of another tribe (for the rule is against
intermarrying in their own tribe), who in after years,
if the budding girl has not eloped or been stolen,
claims her as a matter of right. If one such has
not thus been sealed to him he may either exchange
one of his unconsulted female relatives for some
other blackfellow’s child or sister in another tribe, or
steal a wife. If his Juliet should have eloped, then he
may, by sending the message-stick, and putting on
the pipe-clay and ‘armoury of hate,’ get up an
expedition into the territory of the adjacent tribe,
and take the probable and expected consequence of




not unfair. The green branch is our emblem of
peace. Of the dead bodies of infants, and also of
those of our own relatives who die an unmangled
and violent death, some tribes have eaten, partly,
perhaps as a time-immemorial ceremony, and out of
affection for the dead, but never as an article of food,
like some tribes. (Is this the origin of the mother’s
affectionate saying, “Icould eat you, I love you so?”)
It is lawful and common among some tribes to
strangle old and infirm people—a custom carried
into effect by a relative. The excuse is, to prevent
the aged in times of attack falling into the hands
of the enemy and being tortured. Our offensive
and hunting weapons include the flint-pointed
and spicule-barbed spear, with the wommera (throw-
ing-stick), the fatal waddy, canoe-shaped shield,
leeangle (war club), the bur-reek (stone tomahawk),
and the circling wonguine, which submissively returns
to the thrower’s feet. By incantations and magic,
the native sorcerer dispels deadly native small-pox,
and also eczematous diseases common to the black-
fellow, attributed to fish-eating and other causes.”
As a brochure of this sort, prepared at short notice,
must necessarily be very limited in extent, I refer
the reader for more extended information to the
excellent works on aboriginal affairs and history;
particularly to Brough Smythe’s Aborigines of Victoria,
J. Bonwick’s Fort Phillip Settlement , James Dawson’s
Australian Aborigines, Richmond Henty’s Australasia,
Fison and Howitt’s Kanularoi and Kurnai, and to scarce
works in the Public Library, Melbourne.






Have we Christians aided in bringing about this
result ? and will it yet be said of us, “ Ye found him
hungry, and ye gave him husks; thirsty, and ye
gave him fire-water; naked, and ye clothed him with
the fatal robe of Nessus ?”
Cui bono ? Why all this aborigine reference ? It
is, I reply, made for the purpose of more distinctly
marking the half-century contrast which now follows.
Such was, then, virginal Ballarat. Reader, look on
that picture, as painted by Nature, in August, 1837,
and then on the following one, produced by Nature
and Art, in August, 1887.




monkish abbeys, “ where once the bells were rung
and the mass was sung;” no ancestral halls, nor lichen-
covered walls of military ancients to dilate upon; no
Waterloos nor Trafalgars to versify ; no niches of the
world’s dead great —no, not even a Ballarat canonized
saint to pray to, a gunpowder plot to blow about, nor
“ a street immortalised by the play of Romeo and
Juliet, nor by her tomb —admission, half franc.”
Albeit, within a period of fifty short years, a
golden chrysalis has been developed, and a grand
transformation scene painted in this inland capital,
with its 85 miles of metalled streets —a town that has
sprung up from infancy with the rapidity of enchant-
ment and Aladdin’s lamp-rubbed palace. Here are no
statue-crowned turrets, minarets, and marble piles, for
a Byron to sing about; but he may sing of our golden
sunshine, sans London fogs; of our political, social,
and religious liberty, sans terrorism, unsurpassed, if
even approached, in any of these respects in any
other part of the globe. Ballarat’s population (whose
death-rate is only 13.75 per 1,000) is now over
39,000 —a thoroughly anti-Malthusian fact; for
exactly half-a-century back the population of the
entire colony was only 1,264 !
The yeomen of early days, diggers and store-
keepers, were men of grit, allured mostly from the
industrial and cultivated walks of nations, enterprising
and practical, and who, under “Divine Sophia,”
wisely laid out the plans and limits of a great city,
and transmitted a legacy of wealth, nerf , and vigor to

their offspring —concordant circumstances conspiring
to place this metropolis points ahead in her race
with inland cities. This energy found expression at
the Eureka Stockade, in sturdy anti-convict agitation,
and ballot-box surprises, and was coupled with civic
capacity, loyalty to the Throne, and adhesion to
constitutional government. It was only a corollary
that the effects of the novel and risky toil, austere
and embryonic life of the early colonists, and the
difficulties surrounding and incident to a new and
excited gold-seeking community, attracted suddenly
together from all quarters, should perpetuate their
impressions on the next generation; just as, for
psychological reasons, the dauntless battalions of the
First Napoleon were supremely brave from the fact of
having been born amid the clang of seditious arms
and nursed in the revolutionary days of Louis XYI.
Here the citizen sinks shafts a quarter of a mile
deep, prospects and blasts miles of drives ere he sees
the color of gold, ofttimes not even that, suffering
repeated failures with the pertinacity of Bruce’s
spider, and frequently without its luck. In times
past, “ many who had engaged in gold-mining had
never previously performed any kind of labor ; but so
great was the fascination of the pursuit that tasks the
most arduous were performed under difficulties the
most discouraging.” Hence, a genuine Ballaratarian
settling down in any part of the world quickly betrays
his individuality and early training by his go-ahead
and genial disposition —a disposition en rapport with all
ihh assess


mankind, and unwarped by the centuries-old jealousies
and hatreds of nations ; and if Burns’ idea of a uni-
versal brotherhood is not a fait accompli, and the
world one big lodge, then it certainly is no fault of
our townsman. Wherever he travels he gives his
hearty “ grip,” and pronounces distinctly his shibbo-
leth, “Ballarat,” a word synonymous with “open
sesame ” and hearty welcome.
I now invite the reader to ascend the City Hall
Tower and view the vista of beauty, fruition, and
proceeds of this aforesaid pioneer energy, and summa-
rise local surroundings of interest, and, as we struggle
up the tower let me state, en passant , that although
Luther successfully climbed part of “the Holy
Staircase of Pilate,” it is knee-d\ess to say, in ascending
this corkscrew, he would have stopped sooner, for as
a designed artificial difficulty it is simply unapproach-
able. It would be a fair question for the opinion of
the Council’s counsel, would a case of manslaughter
lie against the corporation (i.e., civic) if an obese rate-
payer got stuck to death in one of its spiral straits ?
May I further add, par parenthese, that tradition
alleges that the design of a certain superb cathedral
was supplied by the devil in exchange for the artist’s
soul; but legends are absolutely silent about Mephisto-
pheles contracting for this unnatural abortion. Around
the tower’s crowning palisade, 135 feet above
the street, lie more examples of nature and art
than the centum eyes of an Argus could take in
at once, and most of which are within
viz.:—


The Surrounding Country ; Ballarat City and Town ; the
Lake and Gardens; Public and Private Buildings, &c.,
viz.:—Alfred Hall, Colleges, Grammar and State Schools,
School of Mines and Museum, Water Supply, Mining,
Public Baths, Foundries, Fine Arts Gallery, Mining
Exchange, Old Colonists’ Association, Burke and Wills,
Eight Hours, and Eureka Stockade Monuments, Burns’,
and Statues at Gardens, Benevolent and Orphan
Asylums, Hospital, Female Home, Mechanics’ Institute,
Public Libraries, Gymnasium, Hotels, Woollen and
Flour Mills, Breweries, Distillery, Cordial Factories,
Churches, Banks, Supreme Court, Gaol, Newspapers,
Street Tree-Planting, Clubs, Fire Brigades, Masonic
Hall, Warehouses and Manufactories, Militia Hall,
Academy of Music, Skating Rinks, Telephone Exchange,
Show-yards, Eastern and Western Ovals, Bowling
Greens, Produce Market, Cattle and Sales Yards,
Reformatory, Sites for the Queen’s and Tom Moore’s
Statues, Mining Plants, The Observatory, &c. all
evidences of material and social progress. Added to
these are other signs of progress, not visible, but their
influence is felt, viz.:—The Liedertafel, Musical Union,
Maennerchor, Eisteddfod, M.I.A. Union, Y.M.C. Associ-
ation, A,N. Association, Horticultural, Hibernian, Cale-
donian, Orange, Temperance, and Ladies’ Clothing
Societies; Turf and Hunt Clubs; also numerous
Friendly and Benefit Societies and Unions.
Surrounding this golden et garden city lies a vast
agricultural, grazing, and mining country, quartered
into four great counties, of which Ballarat is
nearly the focus. This is an important factor, for it
has been well said, “ The cities would be no cities
were it not for the country.” The local fourth-form
boy would be expected to state in his topographical


lesson that Ballarat is bounded, approximately, as
follows:—On the north, by the county of Talbot,
having 1645 square miles of upper volcanic territory,
embracing arable land and rich alluvial and quartz
mines. On the west, by the county of Eipon, contain-
ing 1777 square miles of luxuriant, undulating, prolific
soil of a basaltic and Silurian formation, adorned with
English-looking pastures and lakes. Among them is
fresh-water Burrumbeet, 20 miles in circumference,
and containing codfish weighing up to 30 or 40 lbs.,
Lake Learmonth, Kingston, Spring Hill, Creswick,
and Dowling Forest. On the south is the county
of Grenville, 1477 square miles in extent, and
includes, as may be seen, Mounts Hesse, Stewart,
Bute, and Gellibrand, the deep and salt Lake
Corangamite, with its 72 superficial square miles of
water area. The near half of this county has been
proved highly auriferous; the other half is rich in
agriculture and grass land, and where the highest
price wool of the world is grown. On the east,
by the county of Grant, with its 1852 square
miles of pastoral, agricultural, and auriferous
wealth, including Bungaree, Gordon, and Warren -
heip parishes, and the basaltic Mount, 2463
feet above the sea level, where the prolific soil
has only “to be tickled with a hoe and it
laughs with a harvest.” Some of the land is
worth <£6o an acre, a lather different valuation
to what John Batman put on Victorian soil in 1835,
when he induced the three brothers Jaga-
jaga,and other chiefs (and,curiously enough,
one of them with the patronymic Bungaree)

of the Butigallar tribe, located at or near Port Phillip,
to sell, sign, seal, and deliver to him, on the 6th day of
June, 1835, a tract of land, between Geelong and
Indented Heads, containing about 100,000 acres, for
“ 20 pairs blankets, 30 knives, 12 tomahawks, 10
looking-glasses, 12 pairs scissors,” and an annual
tribute of similar goods. There was also another
so-called contract of sale entered into by the same
commercial gentleman for about 500,000 acres, lying
between the Yarra and Geelong, for the usual knives,
scissors, &c., valued T 45 ; but, to the credit of the
Colonial office, these one-sided bargains were cancelled.
It may here be well to inform the geographically
ignorant in foreign parts-that Ballarat is not now a
suburb of Botany Bay. On the contrary, it is 676
miles distant per train; and, to be exact, the terri-
torial position of our Post Office is 37° 33' 39" south
latitude, and 143° 51' .06" east longitude.
Ballarat {i.e., city and town) has a municipal area
of 13 square miles, and formed streets, mostly
rectangular, long enough, put end to end, to reach in
a direct line from this to Melbourne (and yet London
had not a paved street till the fourteenth century);
55 miles of gas mains; 8,814 buildings, of an annual
rateable value of T 209,105, on which a rate of 2s. in
the T 1 is levied for maintenance, &c., and Is. in the
m for water. The municipal revenue is T 38,000.
Ten miles of horse tramways are in course of

Cupressus Lawsoniana, Macrocarpa, black and white

and such ornamental and umbrageous trees. On
its bosom
“ The swan with arched neck,
Between her white wings mantling proudly, rows
Her state with oary feet
and also are the black swan, wild duck, water hen, and
the rapacious cormorant. On its margin are 25 public
and private boathouses, with a total flotilla of some
135 sailing and rowing boats, 6 steamers, 10 yachts;
and three rowing clubs, with 40 boats. Hydrocharids
and other troublesome weeds in this lake cost the
Council T7OO a year to keep down. Skirting the Lake
are charming villas, palaces of the Anglican and
Roman Catholic bishops, a nunnery, &c. We have no
natural water-attraction like the Bays of Naples,
Lisbon, Rio Janeiro, or a Sydney Harbour ; but we
have this artificial Lake of singular beauty, costing,
with the adjacent Gardens, T 3,000 a year to maintain ;
and we have, moreover, a climate similar in its mean
temperature to that of the first two named places,
and superior to the last two.
The Botanical Gardens reserve of 83 acres was
acquired in 1858. Of this area 33 acres are in flowers
and landscape gardening, the rest in park. This
“ other Eden, demi-paradise,” is rich in botanical
wealth. Here is seen Flora, dressed in harlequin
colors and roseate hues. Every few yards introduces
kaleidoscopic radiances, particularly
“ When Spring unlocks the flowers to paint the laughing soil,”


Among the zigzag promenades are the mile acacia
walk, the palm walk, decked with petunias, phlox,
verbenas, geraniums ; the half-acre of pegged-down
roses, dispensing a fragrance rivalling “ Nard and
Cassia’s balmy smells.” Historian Froude, after
chewing the cud of much travel, in ecstasies writes :
“ Such variety, such splendour of color, such sweet-
ness,such grace in the distribution of treasure collected
there, I had never found combined before, and never
shall again.” Dotted around are beautiful Carrara
statues, the gift of a well-known citizen, while ,£4,000
more are in the course of being similarly spent under
the legacy of another noble-minded man. The
Fernery, 460 feet by 63, is the site of rapture —the
Nirvana, par excellence. There the ferns and lycopods,
of Brazilian density, include the native Dicksonia
squarrosa and antarctica, Cyathea dealbata, black and
white Mexican ferns, intermixed with camellias,
azaleas, ericas, fuchsias, climbing plants, and shrubs,
in blazing effulgence. The place is fairly alive with
song-birds, transferred from the meadows of England.
Here the early-rising pedestrian verifies that
“ None but the lark so shrill and clear !
Now at Heaven’s gate she clasps her wings,
The morn not waking till she sings.”
In addition to the skylark, there are the thrush, black-
bird, and starling. On dit, see Naples and die;
I say, see the Lake and Gardens, and you
will want to live to enjoy their Elysian
charms, and “the rapture of repose that’s
here.”


“ Our plenteous streams a various race supply,
The bright-eyed perch, with fins of various dye ;
The yellow carp, in scales bedropt with gold ;
Swift trouts, diversified with crimson stains.”
Another object of interest at the Gardens, and the
first of the kind started in the Colony, is the unpre-
tending fish-hatching house, where some 12,000
English and Californian brown trout are annually
hatched. The modus operandi (the French dry
stripping) is briefly this : the ova are in July taken
from a few of the finest fish caught in the prepared
rill and placed on trays, over which there is a con-
stant and regulated flow of water. In 54 days the
tiny tribe break their shell. They reach one stage
after another until they arrive at the three large ponds
(one 70 feet long), and then after twelve months’
infancy they are counted and turned into the Lake to
face the world and their natural enemies in the water
and out of it. Hence Izaak Walton’s advice (and
did he base it on St. Paul’s injunction, “ Study to be
quiet,”) can here be followed—“ All who are lovers
of virtue, be quiet, and go a-angling.” The Ballarat
Fish Acclimatization Society has placed piscators
and the public for ever under obligation by having
stocked with English trout many important lakes and
streams in Victoria, and in some instances beyond it.
The English perch was introduced into the Lake 10th
October, 1869, and have been caught up to 61bs.,
with the live or artificial minnow, 81b. carp, English
trout up to lllbs. and 30 inches long, IJlb. tench,
and large eels, all of which are varied and numerous
enough to make Pope’s lines applicable :




tinizing the dates of long-past human things, the
bounds of effaced states, and the lives of deceased
kings,” squaring the circle, and reading “ what a
little foolery governs the world.” Added to these
monuments of scholastic progress there is our great
State system, under the free, secular, and compulsory
Act of 1873. Out of our local population, 10,338
scholars between six and fifteen years of age are on
the rolls of 17 superb school buildings. The educa-
tion of 222,054 children costs the Colony of Victoria,
yearly, T 629,000. Altogether it is a system affording
quite a royal, cheap, and easy road to knowledge.
’Twas lather different in the early days of our
ancestors. Josh Billings is right. “ Schooling when
I was a colt didn’t lie round so loose as it diz now,
and learning waz picked up oftener by running yure
head against a stun wall than by any other kind ov
mineralogy.”
The School of Mines, and its Museum, is where
are taught, I was going to say, all the wisdom of the
Books of Solomon, and the arts, sciences, and know-
ledges of the day —metallurgy, mining, materia
medica, pharmacy, natural philosophy, telegraphy,
chemistry, photography, mineralogy, engineering,
surveying, assaying, drawing, mathematics, electricity,
languages, and I don’t know what else. Examinations
are about to be conducted and diplomas granted on
the affiliated conditions prescribed by the Melbourne
Alma Mater. In this intellectual nursery the antiquarian
neophyte may delve into the treasures of the dead past;
the young Kepler, with the aid of the 26-inch specu-




Take the Band of Hope and Albion Consols Company
for instance. It has expended a million and a-half on
its underground and surface works. Its underground
drives, put end to end, would reach 30 miles. Its
shafts together total a mile and a-quarter. Its main
shaft is over a quarter of a mile deep. It has yielded
27f tons of “ saint-seducing gold,” realising about
£2,640,000, and paid a million one hundred and fifty
two thousand pounds in dividends. The geological
formation of the locality is lower Silurian, overlaid
by basalt and newer tertiary. Mining is in quartz
and alluvial. Thirty-four years ago, “Jewellers’ shops”
were opened in holes B'feet square and 8 feet deep.
From these as much as £lO,OOO or £12,000 worth of
gold was obtained, and, occasionally, famous nuggets
like the Canadian, 132 lbs.,in February,’s3; Welcome,
2217 ozs., on 11th June, ’5B, found 180 feet from the
surface; Lady Hotham, 1177 ozs.; Nil Besperandum,
540 ozs.; the Lady Loch, 617 ozs., found this
month in the Midas Claim, 120 feet from surface,
and about 50 feet from the spot where the Lady
Brassey nugget was just previously unearthed.
Those were truly the maelstrom days of excitement,
the temps d ’ emharras de richesses , the cornucopia days,
the days of picking “the pockets of Midas, the golden
pools of the Pactolian (Yarrowee) River.” Since
then till now, Ballarat mines have won £53,600,000,
out of a grand total for Victoria of £216,000,000.
The first discoverer of the precious metal was a
wheelwright, Hiscock, near Buninyong, who came-
across the royal ore when grubbing a tree in August,


’5l, and thus he became a modern apocalyptic revealer
of wealth, like the Revelation Angel who broke the
seven seals, diffusing “ power, riches, wisdom,
strength, honor, glory, and blessing.” About the
following month, gold was found at Golden Point,
and on the banks of the Yarrowee, whose cradle
and pan-disturbed water “ was amber, and its gravel
gold.” Auriferous quartz is found in vertical and flat
reefs, mixed in varying proportions, and according to
locality, with iron and arsenical pyrites, copper, zinc,
blende, hematite, galena, and malachite.
Public Baths. —Those in the East are the largest
in the Colony. The basin is 187 feet long by 80 feet
wide. Here is seen, when old Sol is flaming in the
sky, a crowd “ suspended on the bosom of a cooler
world.” The Western Baths have also hydropathic
adjuncts.
Foundries. —The Phoenix Company, Registered,
has turned out over 200 locomotive engines. Its
one hundredth engine was reached in April, 1883.
The buildings cover some two acres of land, and
.£40,000 capital are invested. When in full work,
300 Tubal-cains are employed, and 18 Yulcanian
fires are kept going, from whose ashes, Phoenix-like,
new creations arise. The Union, another hive, illu-
mined by Promethean sparks, is where the finest
beam and other engines, heavy machinery, &c., are
rhade. There are also several other foundries.
Fine Arts Gallery, founded by one of our large-
hearted pioneers, exhibits an excellent variety of-
pictures. There are not among them “ poems” of
» ‘


JUBILEE SKETCH.
Rubens, Raphael, or Correggio, but there are, what
to us is of infinitely more importance, the produc-
tions of rising Colonial artists. Added to these are
imported gems lent by citizens. The Gallery is a
popular resort, “ where fancy may revel, refreshed and
delighted.” A T 5,000 edifice is about to be erected
on a valuable site granted by a paternal Government.
The “ Corner” is preparing to remove to the T 5,000
new Mining Exchange, now in course of erection.
Here pulsates the great mining heart of the Colony,
and where success, hope, and disappointment often
shake hands. Brokers go on ’Change twice daily.
The Old Colonists’ Association is about to build
next to the Mining Exchange. One of its objects is
to preserve the memory of those who laid our mate-
rial foundations and raised our social and political
superstructure, and to hand down their imperishable
patronymics to posterity, which is hardly likely to be
entirely successful, since “ the Pyramids themselves,
doating with age, have forgotten the names of their
founders.”
Burke and Wills Monument, of homely design,
reminds one of the ill-fated in 1861, and, as Gordon


The Eureka Stockade Monument was erected in
memoriam of the brave who died, resisting wrong and
official ignorance, on the 3rd December, 1854, thus
endorsing the Bard’s conviction, that “ strong reasons
make strong actions.”
The Carrara Marble Statuary, in the Botanical
Gardens, includes the beautiful and appropriate
Flora Farnese, the goddess of blossoms and spring ;
rustic Pomona; Bacchante ; Leda, and her disguised
lover; youthful Hebe; and the four figures representing
Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter; thieving Mer-
cury ; and, lastly, Hercules, with his raised club and
Nemaean lion’s skin, seemingly doing one of his twelve
labors; or, may be, he is looking after fair Hebe,
whom he married when they reached Olympian
groves. May the donator receive in the “ By-and-by”
“ a white stone” engraven.
The executors of another noble and generous-minded
pioneer—and Plato says, “If a man be endued with a
generous mind, this is the best kind of nobility”—
have purchased in Rome, and is now in transitu , a
charming group of marble statuary by Professor
Benzoni. Its destination is the Gardens. It comprises
three figures, representing father, mother, and infant,
escaping from Pompeii. Four bass-reliefs illustrate
the eruption of Mount Vesuvius and the destruction
of the city, and seem to mark the very moment when
“the earth and surging seas give signal” of the
warning.
“ Hark, the trump of thunder !
Lo, earth rent asunder !
And, forth, on his angel-throne,
He comes through the gloom.”


This great work of art is of the highest class, and
thoroughly educational. The best Continental judges
value it at T 4,000 ; but it was purchased, owing to
fortuitous circumstances, at considerably less. Also
a fine statue of Sir William Wallace, chiselled in the
Colony, and costing T 1,200. The figure is 7 feet 2
inches, the conjectured height of that Scottish hero,
who is supposed to be standing watching the English
army straggling across the narrow bridge at Stirling.
About T 1,500 more have yet to be spent in the same
direction under this same will. Handsome statues
of the Queen and Tom Moore are about to be erected
on sites reserved in Sturt Street, facing the City Hall.
The Benevolent Asylum is a fine Elizabethian pile
of buildings, housing 270 men and women, decrepit,
and “ between the lights,” and where are seen
“ The failing ear and eye, the slower limbs,
Whose brief name is age.”
Belief is afforded weekly to 667 outside poor.
The Hospital, of Italian order, is a noble institution,
containing 160 beds. Its foundation-stone was laid
with masonic honors in 1856. Here the humanitarian
may prove that “ selfishness is not only the essence
of all sin, but directly or indirectly the cause of all
disease, both acute and chronic.”
The Orphan Asylum, of Elizabethian design, is
another triumph of humanity, and stands in loco
parentis to 160 children.
The Female Home is a substantial building, a place
of refuge, whose doors are ever open to receive the .
much-to-be-pitied sick Magdalens.


The Mechanics’ Institute, with lecture-hall and
suite of rooms, affords mental pabulum for 800 sub-
scribers, and is, I believe, the finest example in tUe
Colony. It is a bold Italian four-storied building,
containing 14,000 volumes. The Public Library,
Barkly Street, is a credit to all concerned. 10,000
books adorn its shelves. The City Free Library is
an open house. It is about to be replaced by a costly
edifice. The Gymnasium is a spacious building,
splendidly equipped, where the indispensable sanus
corpus is prepared for a sound mind. Some of the
Hotels are unsurpassed in point of excellence.
The Woollen Mill, at Sunny Corner, with T 40,000
invested capital, is in full work. So is the Doveton
Street Mill, and which, together, annually turn out
210,000 yards’ of cloth. Three Breweries have a
large annual output. The Distillery at Warrenheip
produces yearly 70,000 gallons of whiskey, gin, and
spirits of wine. Time fails me to set out our agricultural
machinery, leather, boot, soap, and candle factories.
There are about 40 churches and chapels, and a syna-
gogue. The Town Mission Hall and Salvation Army
Barracks are creedless institutions, penetrating the
Gethsemanes of society. Nine banks of issue, two
savings banks, two cemeteries, a supreme court-
house, and an adjacent gaol for the falcons and
vampires of society. The three daily newspapers
are the Star, Courier, and Evening Post. The Orderly
Boom is a hall 180 feet by 76 feet, the largest of
one span in the Colony. There are numerous
side rooms. Cost nearly j£Booo.


.TTTBTT.EE SKETCH.
Street Tree-Planting is here an arboreal feature.
Sturt Street was first planted in 1860. There are
no in the streets of city and town 3000 flourishing
trees. Victoria Street, in the town, is, for its length,
the finest planted street in the Colony ; the varieties
comprise Oriental plane, elm, oak, gum,Wellingtonias,
and Italian poplars.
Anthony Trollope, after travelling the world over,
and picking up nuggets of information in the four
corners of it, and to whom no one can attach even the
suspicion of “blowing,” writes: —“Ballarat struck
me with more surprise than any other city in Australia.
In point of architectural excellence and general
civilized city comforts, it is certainly the metropolis
of Australian goldfields.” And such is the general
verdict of distinguished visitors, from Royalty down-
wards; and it needs no St. Teresa or Seeress of
Prevorst to prophesy as to Ballarat’s possibilities, or
that it —the microcosm of Manchester —will continue
the metropolis, growing and “ spreading itself like
a green bay tree.” Is it then any wonder that the
distant Ballaratarian regards this spot as his Balia —his
“ resting-place”—the esse of his being—and prays with
his heart towards it (with all the fervor of the proverbial
hart, which “ panteth after the water-brooks”), as did
the worshipping Jew towards Jerusalem ?

PRESS NOTICES.
* * # * * Mr. Little is to be complimented on the manner
in which he performed his difficult task. As will be observed, the sketch
commences with the discovery of the district 50 years ago, and the style
throughout is racy ; while from an instructive point of view, nothing further
can be desired from the sketch. The aborigine references should prove
interesting to all readers acquainted with this district, and the “ hard iacts
in the compilation are considerably enlivened by no small amount of imagery.
The first part of the review is devoted to an imaginary conversation on Black
Hill with an aboriginal, who gives the topography of the country, and speaks
of native names and of the manners and customs of the blacks. In the
second portion of the sketch is presented a view from the City Hall tower.
Ballarat was discovered in the year of the Queen’s accession, and, of course,
the jubileo of Ballarat and that of Her Majesty came together.— Ballarat Star.
* # # * * It is published and distributed under the
auspices of the City Council, and does much credit to the councillor who
undertook w r hat to him was evidently a pleasing commission. The descript.on
is written in a genial and .original style; while the details have the meiit of
being free from over-copiousness, and strictly accurate. Being in goodly-sized
type, and written in a smooth and graceful way, the sketch will, no doubt,
be eagerly and widely perused, and afford gratification to everybody who
reads it.— Ballarat Courier.
# * * * * The brochure will, we think, fully answer the
purpose intended, namely, convey to all who may have the privilege of
perusing its contents an interesting and comprehensive bird’s-eye view of
Ballarat in its primal state, coupled with its existing condition as brought
about by human energy and art. Mr. Little is original and amusing in his
introduction; his descriptive matter concerning the past and present is
accurate and instructive ; and, taken as a**whole, the sketch should be widely
read with interest, pleasure, and profit. — Ballarat Bvening Post,
Mr. William Little, of Ballarat, furnishes us with a copy of an interesting
Jubilee Sketch of the Golden City. The sketch is well prepared and neatly
printed, and does the writer much credit. — Creawick Advertiser,
A Jubilee Sketch of Ballarat, under the title Ballarat s Birth, 1837, and
Ballarat’s Jubilee, 1887, has been published under the auspices of the City
Council and circulated. The sketch is a very interesting one, and Councillor
Li Ale has evidently taken a great deal of trouble in its corapilation.—Aryas.
* * * * * Partaking at once of the nature of a guide book,
it is written in a style which so combines lightness and interest that one
would think that the writer’s pen had not been a goose-quill, but a little tuft
of eider-down. Ballarat may add to her other boasts that in her Jubilee
year she possesses a writer whose pen is at once graceful, original, and
humorous, to such an extent that I cannot resist the temptation to cull some
extracts to show how a lively fancy may make even history entertaining.
This is how he describes the reply of the first colonising white men who
camped at Ballarat in August, 1837, * * * * There are
many passages of half ironical humor equal to this, and occasionally a touch
is dashed in like the drop of lemon on the oyster.— Warrnambool Standard.
# # * * * Mr. Little has, in the comparatively brief space
of the review, done full justice to the rise and progress of this district, and no
institution, &c. of importance has been allowed to go unnoticed. The
Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company have also arranged with
Mr. Little for the writing of a sketch of Ballarat for inclusion in the new
guide book. As this guide will have a world-wide circulation, it should be
the means of further bringing Ballarat into prominence in various centres in
Europe and elsewhere. — Oeelong Advertiser.
