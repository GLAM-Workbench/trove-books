cultivated, till they find themselves no longer a fine race of free
negroes, but poverty-stricken, decimated, scattered, and powerless.
The natives are richer, more industrious, and generally more intel-
ligent, than the Boers. It is but natural in a lawless country that
the idle poor should plunder those who are better off than them-
selves. Negroes should be treated sternly, not cruelly. Sternness
creates respect; cruelty leads to rebellion. A great crisis is
approaching; the time may be near when the natives will sweep
the Northern Transvaal settlements like a fiery blast; then not a
house will be left standing, not a blade of corn waving. There are
worse savages than Kaffirs and Zulus. Those who stick feathers in
their hair, put grease on their bodies, and bow to Mumbo Jumbo,
are not the only savages; white ones?Boers?may be worse. The
British public has not yet heard the last of the convention, or seen
a tithe of the mischief it is working and will work. Neo-o-
-?? n O
tiation poised on the razor-edge of overdrawn niceties has become
a weakness. The Colonial Office is entangled in its own immea-
sureable red-tape. The policy towards the Transvaal was com-
promise, nay, condonation. Too hesitating for action, too fidgety
for positive inaction, the Liberal Government chose the medium.
It will not entirely give up the Transvaal, so a convention is
framed, which has hitherto proved merely waste paper. There was
a path of commercial triumph open to the Transvaal; but Boerish
lead drove away British gold, and political injustice made the
rights of property nil. Now, who will risk his capital or person in
i ; ht is right, and lawlessness alone is stable ?

THE ANNEXATION OF NEW GUINEA.
To natives of Australia?indeed, to the great body of those who-
dwell in Australia ?it seems strange that there should be the least
hesitation in the minds of British statesmen, or the least cavil on
the part of the British public, concerning the annexation of New
Guinea. The instinct of self-preservation, accompanied by pride in
their achievements as colonists, and a sincere and loyal desire to-
advance the power and might of the empire to which, it is their
proud boast, they belong, is all-mastering: they cannot understand
the argument of the breeches-pocket which arises in the minds of
the statesmen and people of the mother land when they are called
upon to assume fresh responsibilities and spread the bounds of the
empire further. The colonists as a rule, I believe, are not sympa-
thisers with the Manchester school of politicians, and, except in
extreme Radical circles?circles that cherish and openly avow the-
desirability of separation of Australia from the empire there is-
not to be found a spark of approval of that policy which Goldwin
Smith enunciated, which secured the favour of the before-mentioned
Manchester school, and which drew forth such hearty scorn from the-
England-loving Laureate in his memorable poem ?To the Queen.? The-
colonists in British colonies it has often been said are more loyal
than Englishmen themselves; and who that studies the feelings of
those around him whilst Britain is at war for the maintenance of
her power or empire in any part of the world, or engaged in the
diplomacy requisite to avert such calamity, but must recognise that
Jingoism is as strong ? by the long wash of Australasian seas? as in
the most conservative of constituencies in England ? A glow of
pride filled the minds of men when London Punch depicted, with
the emphasis Tenniel?s pencil can give to a national and patriotic
idea, the British lion serenely couching on the banks of the Suez
canal, with the keys of India under his majestic paw: the keys
which Beaconsfield saw should be in British keeping, for they


opened the gates of the highway to India. The cheers that greeted
Lords Beaconsfield and Salisbury on their return from the Berlin
Congress?where Britain had once again asserted her right to a
O o
voice among the nations, and'silenced the Charivaris and witlings,
who had long made her the butt of their scorn and contempt?were
echoed by the majority of the Australian people. The hearts of the-
latter felt with biood-warm indignation the blundering in Zulu-land
and Afghanistan, and the humiliation of the Transvaal convention,
and welcomed with feelings as sincere as any Jingo of them all the
news of victories at Ulundi, at Candahar, and at Tel-el-Kebir. No-
colonist true to the instincts of country and race will ever care to
see ? that little isle, that England??which Shakespeare proudly
boasted ? never did and never shall sit at the proud feet of a con-
queror? ?reduced to the condition of ? some third-rate isle half
sunk in her own seas,? like Lear discrowned and contemned amongst
the nations. This patriotism it is which, joined to self-interest, is-
at the root of the Australian belief in the possession of New Guinea
by England (or by Australia on her behalf), and which maintains-
that England does herself and does us wrong if she stays in her
course of empire in the southern seas. The ? national tradition? is-
a heritage and belief amongst the mass of colonists yet; and the
idea of a federated empire,as well as a federated Australian Dominion,,
has power to move us to feelings of loyalty and pride. When
England renounces her policy of ? ships, colonies, and commerce," -
and says of her colonies ? loose the bonds and let them go,? we may
well lament her decadence, and seek safety in independence. I
do not believe that England will ever do anything of the sort,,
for the common-sense of the nation?her amour propre ?not to
mention her interests, urge that she shall proceed instead of retro-
gress in her business of spreading civilisation in the South, whero
her sons have already achieved so much deserving of admiration.
Delays, however, are dangerous?and the policies of nations
alter. France just now, for instance, is developing a desire for fresh
acquisitions; Germany is not averse to spreading the wings of her
commerce in the South Seas; and it is a matter of history that Prince
Bismarck caused exhaustive inquiries to be made as to the suitability
of New Guinea for a German naval station; Russia, in spite of her
hands being full in Central Asia, has been credited, rightly or
wrongly, with designs on Austral Papua; restless Italians, sighing for
new homes, have thought it worthy of colonisation; and Anglo-
phobiac Americans?in defiance of their own Monroe doctrine?have


turned their longing eyes, if not their vessels? prows, in the
direction of ? the second largest island in the world, hinting at its
proximity to England?s colonies as a most important point in connec-
tion with the very improbable contingency of war, should the
mother country refuse to transfer to them her Canadian Dominion.
There has always been the possibility, if not the probability, of New
Guinea tempting foreign nations, and many times has the possible
danger been laid before British Cabinets. At a meeting of the
Royal Colonial Institute on December 17,1878, upon the reading of
?a paper by Signor d?Albertis upon the fitness of New Guinea for
colonisation, Mr. Frederick Young remarked: ?
? It may not be in the recollection of many of the Fellows of
the Institute present that the Royal Colonial Institute has taken
a very active part for some period in reference to this very question
of the colonisation of New Guinea. More than three years ago,
viz., in the month of April, 1875, we organised a most important
?deputation, consisting not only of our own Council but of a number
?of the leading merchants of London also, and waited on the then
Colonial Secretary, Lord Carnarvon, pressing on him the importance,
in our opinion, of the Government taking steps to secure the colo-
nisation of the eastern part of New Guinea, because there was a
fear that, if it were allowed to be colonised without some superin-
tendence on their part, great and serious consequences might
ensue to the natives and to those probably who attempted such
colonisation. More recently we have been engaged in correspond-
ence with the last and present Colonial Ministers on the subject,
and it was only in the month of May last that I addressed a
despatch to Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, the importance of which the
lapse of three years since first we communicated with the Govern-
ment on the question had only more forcibly been impressed on
our minds of the Government taking some active steps on the
subject.?
The interest of the Colonial Institute had been awakened by
the proceedings in Australia in regard to annexation. Seventeen
or eighteen years ago the formation of a company to colonise the
island was mooted, and there were not wanting scores of adven-
turous spirits prepared to join in the scheme: the one thing wanting
was British sanction to ? exercise jurisdiction,? and this not being
obtained the plan fell through. No more practical result followed
the despatch of Sir Hercules Robinson (prompted by Sir Henry
Parkes) to Lord Carnarvon in favour of annexation, nor an influen-


tial meeting in Sydney with the view of forming a company to
colonise New Guinea and trade its products to Australian ports.
The Australasian legislatures passed resolutions in favour of
annexation, and transmitted them to the Colonial Office; but these
had no effect. The deputation from the Colonial Institute, to which Mr.
Young refers, was headed by the Duke of Manchester, and strongly
advised annexation; but Earl Carnarvon replied unfavourably. A
New Guinea Colonisation Association was formed in London by
Lieut. Armit, R.N.; but the British Government refused it coun-
tenance, and the adventure fell through. From end to end of New
Guinea history, of late years, the Australian Governments and
people, and the returned colonists in England, have favoured, and
the Imperial Government have disapproved of, annexation. The
divergence of opinion is significant of possible future differences.
It is easy to see that, had a foreign nation annexed New Guinea
whilst England temporised, and had its strategetical position and
probable industrial wealth been lost to Australia, no slight
bitterness must have been felt by the people of the latter land.
The coup of the Queensland Government has, however, brought the
whole question to the point at which resistance to the will of the
Australian people can scarcely go further. The loyalty of the
colonies to the tradition of the Empire, and their own self-interest,
cannot be longer ignored. In taking the action they have done, the
Government of Queensland have thrust upon the Imperial Govern-
ment the necessity of thoroughly discussing the matter. Between
the courses of compliance and refusal there is that of tem-
porising ; but, if English respect for colonisation is not dead, it is
scarcely likely the Cabinet, in view of the unanimous approval of
the Australian people, will delay further. Should they do so, it will
be the duty of the Australian Governments to continue the agita-
tion for annexation until wiser counsels prevail in England.
The paramount question is, What is to be gained by the occu-
pation of New Guinea ? The strategetical position of the island
is the first point of advantage; the value of its trade the
second. So long as Great Britain recognises the duty of protecting
her possessions whilst she is involved in war, so long will she con-
sider it a duty to retain every point of vantage from whence they
may be attacked. A glance at the map will show that New Guinea
is a point from which a blow may be struck at Australia. In its
present state, possibly it may not menace us; but what may not
happen, after ten or twenty years of occupation by a nation


with military instincts ? The island would simply be a point
d'appui from whence hostile forces, naval and military, might be
despatched to prey upon our coasts and commerce?a commerce, by
the way, which in ten or twenty years will have vastly increased,
and may be expected to have extended in all directions in the
Pacific, Indian, and Southern Oceans. Such a contingency as hostile
fleets and armaments in these waters, having a basis at New
Guinea, may be remote; but it is not altogether improbable. That
the country is tropical, and supposed to be inimical to Europeans,
may be cited in disproof of the likelihood of the establishment of
a naval depot upon it by a foreign power; but the theory of the
island not being fitted for Europeans to live upon seems simply to
be a supposition contrary to experience. Europeans leave lived
there, just as they live in other countries of similar temperature;
and although it?is possible at the outset lives would be lost through
the malarial influences engendered by the rank vegetation and
swamps, such influences are rapidly modified by cultivation and the
removal of the sources of disease. The fears entertained that the
country is not suitable for Europeans appear to be the fruit of
ignorance of the country. I may point out that there were similar
fears entertained with regard to the interior of Australia at localities
where human life and the existence of stock were held to be im-
possible. These supposed deserts have proved to be well-grassed
lands, and have been occupied and made to yield up their resources.
It is equally likely that some current notions on the head of New
Guinea?s unfitness for European occupation may be dispelled ?that
it may prove to be simply an Austral-India, and just as capable of
supporting white men?s lives. Its elevated plateaus and mountains
approaching the snow-line are points of resemblance to Indian
topography, and it is reasonable to believe that, when the interior is
opened up, life will be just as bearable as it is in Northern Queens-
land, the Northern Territory, or the Straits Settlements. It must
be remembered, in discussing this matter, that ignorance of New
Guinea is still profound. Something is known of its coast. Mis-
sionaries and explorers have advanced some distance up its navig-
able streams, and have contributed all that we know concerning it;
but, withal, Papua is still almost a terra incognita. Only one
individual ever professed to have explored it thoroughly; but that
individual proved himself to be the very Ferdinand Mendez Pinto
of explorers, and, like Congreve?s hero, ? a liar of the first magni-
tude.? It cannot be said with the slightest degree of certainty


that New Guinea cannot be opened to European occupation, and
whilst this uncertainty exists there is the present fear of foreign
occupation.
Not alone is there fear of the island being accepted by a foreign
power as the base of naval operations. Should it fall to France to
take possession of New Guinea, what hostage have we that it would
not become a Cayenne or New Caledonia, and Australian society be
menaced by the felonry and vagabondage of the Republic ? Such is
the purpose the Republic Frangaiae imagines England intends the
island for, and such would appear to be the idea entertained by the
French Government of colonies in the South Seas. From this fate,
from the fate of colonisation without superintendence of a strong
and authoritative character, it is to be hoped the natives of the
island will be spared. It is England?s great mission to develop and
civilise the native races ; her missionaries are foremost in the work,
and it would be a matter for deep regret if the Papuans were sub-
ject to any other than her benign influence.
But the argument having most weight with the British people
is unquestionably the prospect of trade. We in Australia have not
done badly in assisting England?s commerce from the time when (vide
?? Wade?s Chronological History?) the receipt of a few mats woven
by convicts at Botany Bay was considered an occurrence worthy of
?chronicling. ï¿½23,982,404 of imports from, and ï¿½26,975,381 exports
to, the United Kingdom do not form a bad record of Austral pro-
gress; nor is the advancement of Fiji, the latest of Britain?s southern
?colonies?possessed of a tropical climate ?to be thrown away as an
insignificant argument in favour of further southern annexation.
Each fresh colony adds to the wealth and might of Great Britain,
and her additional ? responsibility? is in small proportion to her
advantages from new ?plantations.? The question next arises,
What are the resources of New Guinea ?
Signor d?Albertis, who made several excursions into the interior
at a distance of from twenty to twenty-five miles, travelling in
various directions, speaks of its well-irrigated and extensive plains,
and alleges it is very suitable for colonisation, ? being a well
watered country with an abundance of grass, suitable both for agricul-
tural purposes and the rearing of cattle ; the climate being good and
the heat moderate.? There are fine plantations of bananas, yams,
taro, and an abundance of bread-fruit. The rivers teem with fish
and the woods with cocoanuts. Signor d?Albertis considers New
Guinea easy of colonisation, and suggests for the purpose an agri-


cultural mission to teach the natives European methods of cultiva-
tion, concerning which he found them curious and eager. Mr.
Lawes, the well-known missionary, disparages to some extent the
productions of New Guinea, urging also that the natives do not
require nor favour European production ; but his views were
expressed years ago, and it is possible he may have since modified
them. Whether or not, it must be remembered, as I have mentioned
before, very little is known of either the resources or capabilities of
the island, and that only when native races are brought into close
contact with Europeans do they adopt the usages of the latter, and
become consumers of their productions. Mr. Lawes speaks of the
possession by the natives of clubs made of ebony and rosewood, and
of the circumstance of nutmegs having been found in the crops of
pigeons, pointing to the probability of spices being indigenous.
Other authorities show that coffee and splendid sugar-cane can be
successfully grown. Concerning its flora and fauna, Professor Owen
declares ? there is no tract of intertropical land from which so much
of novelty and interest may be expected as from New Guinea?; the
bird of Paradise?the Paradisea apodea of Linnaeus?is found in
abundance, and its skin has long been an article of trade. Gold
exists in the island ; the Dutch have obtained it in their por-
tion of New Guinea, if the printed information on the point is to be
trusted. But whether it exists in payable quantities or not on the
eastern side of the island remains to be proved, no systematic
prospecting over any large extent of territory having been done.
Mr. Hanran, however, who formed one of the Colonist expedition,
says ?New Guinea is well known to be auriferous, and I know of
no country with such indications as we found there, without payable
gold being discovered in some part of it.? The discovery of payable
gold would speedily lead to the opening up of New Guinea; but, as
in Australia, pastoral and agricultural occupation is likely to pre-
cede that event.? Mr. Hanran also says ; ? From the very little I
know myself, and from what I could learn from others, I think it
will become a rich held for the planter. The virgin soil producing
such rich vegetation spontaneously, and the beautiful sugar-cane
and other tiopical plants that are grown by the natives, are induce-
ments that will attract the attention of men who will initiate and
fertilise the growth of rice, sugar, and other tropical produce
in that country. Mr. Chester, who recently took possession of the
country in the name of the British Government, writing some time
ago, said of the inhabitants?? These people cannot be dispossessed of


their country as easily as the aborigines of Australia. They have
vested interests and rights that cannot be disregarded ; but I am
sanguine the day is not far distant when this land will be opened
up to the markets of Manchester and Sheffield.? And Mr. Labilliere,
speaking before the Colonial Institute, pointed out the similarity of
blew Guinea to Ceylon, and expressed a belief that it will produce
tropical products which can only be produced in a very limited area in
the world?those which can only be cultivated upon elevated table
lands or mountains in the tropics ; whilst, should the land be opened
up to commerce, England will receive the raw material and furnish
the manufactured goods for the New Guineans. These expressions
of opinion, with many others which might be quoted, show the
advantages likely to accrue to England?and also to Aus-
tralia?from annexation, if the business of colonisation be carried
out. lam aware that there is a vast difference of opinion prevalent
as to the actual facts of New Guinea?s suitability for Europeans.
Some observers describe the products as scant, the soil as marshy,
the atmosphere as malarial and unhealthy, and the natives as
idle thieves; but the probability is that the truth is to be found be-
tween the two extremes of opinion. The recently published accounts
by Mr. Chester and the missionaries concerning the schools, villages,
and plantations of the island, go far to show that the harsh judg-
ment of the population as lazy and inclined to theft is an
invention, or refers to a section of the natives only,and that the opinion
of Mr. Stone, F.R.G.S., given to the Royal Geographical Society?viz.,
that the New Guineans ? are far above the ordinary savage in both
physical and moral attributes??is more correct. In all probability,
when the truth concerning New Guinea is known, it will be
found to lie with those who take an optimist view of its resources
and value, rather than with those who pronounce it a country
which should remain, so far as civilisation is concerned, amongst
? the waste places of the earth.?
A vast deal that is both interesting and instructive might be
written, if space allowed, upon the explorations and discoveries in
the island, the progress of missionary effort, and the aspect of the
annexation movement ; one thing, however, needs to be said : The
business of colonisation must be proceeded with under the strictest
conditions. There must be a higher motive than cheap labour for
Queensland plantations at the root of the enterprise ; the develop-
ment of the native races in the arts of peace and civilisation, not
Vol. VIII?No. 43. T


their degradation and debauchery, must go hand in hand with the
steps taken to make it a ? white man?s country,? and to reap the
gains of its commerce. As is well said by a writer in a Sydney
Journal: ?English power in New Guinea should be, of itself, a bene-
ficent influence ; but it must be a stern and strong and terribly
restraining power ; it must watch and guard the rights of the pre-
sent inhabitants jealously, as it guards the right of Sir Thomas
MTlwraith to his house in Brisbane or his station on the Maranos.
It must advance the civilisation of the people by slow degrees ;
must teach without robbing them ; must give them food and keep
them from poison ; must begin, in short, upon the simple and
Justifiable assumption that it is necessary, for the welfare of the em-
pire and the safety of Australia, that England should have and hold
that great territory adjacent to our shores, and should proceed upon
a recognition that possession implies duty.?
Only upon such recognition, and such methods, can English
honour be sustained and prosperity achieved for the community
which it is proposed to bring within the pale of civilisation.
George A. Bicknell.
