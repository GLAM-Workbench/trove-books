FIRE PROTECTION
PERSOIiL PROTECTION
Rubbish can cause fires clean up the yard NOW.

do this at short notice.
When you see the blinding flash of light, if in the open
with any form of cover handy, run for it. You will escape
some of the heat, as if lasts for about 20 seconds.
Curtains can catch fire —• be prepared to remove them
when advised.

Shutters painted white keep out heat make them NOW.
Water fights fires—-have plenty of containers ready in the
house—water supplies may be interrupted, so DON'T rely
on the garden hose.
First-aid equipment and a knowledge of how to treat burns
is essential—remember normal medical facilities will not
be available.
If in a bouse, lie down immediately out of the direct line
of any windows to avoid the heat which is entering. If a
table or bed is neir, get underneath it
If in a car, pull tq the side, turn off the engine, and crouch
down as low as you can with your face turned downwards.

lower floors are better than upper
floors.
As the rays are of no significance
beyond four miles, this particular
danger is the least widespread.
The danger from blast is much more
serious and extensive, and if you do
all you can to protect yourself
against heat and blast, you will have
gone a long way to defeat radiation
//
Protection against radiation is diffi-
cult because of the penetrative
powers of the rays.
Cover is the ONLY answer the
thicker and denser the better. Con-
gether. This form of shelter also
gives protection against radiation
and fall-out.
A shelter of this type should be con-
structed as far as possible away from
buildings to lessen the danger of
their collapsing on to the shelter.
If you have already protected your-
self against heat, on seeing the
blinding flash of light, remain where
you are for at least two minutes, or
until bricks, tiles, glass, etc., have
stopped falling.
A narrow trench, sides supported
and with a supported covering of 3'
of packed earth, gives good protec-
tion. Don't forget to screen the
