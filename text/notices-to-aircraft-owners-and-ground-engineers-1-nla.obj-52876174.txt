1921
8. Painting Over Inspection Stamps
(223549/21)
1. When painting aircraft, care must be taken that the
inspection stamps on the parts so painted are not obliterated.
2, Ground Engineers are responsible for ascertaining that
all parts of the aircraft have been manufactured under the
conditions laid down in Air Navigation Directions, 1932
(A.N.D.11.), Section 11, Paragraphs 19-22, and Inspection
Stamps are the only evidence that these conditions have
been fulfilled.
(7/9/1921, Revised 1/4/1934)
1922
8. Flexible Rubber Connections in Aircraft
(357405/22)
The attention of Ground Engineers is directed to the
following information with regard to the maintenance of
Flexible Rubber Connections as fitted to aircraft:—
L. The term " rubber joint ” as used in this notice is to be
taken to include all flexible rubber connections in aircraft or
on aero-engines, for oil, petrol or water.
2. Rubber joints fitted to engines or aircraft that have
been stored for a period exceeding three months should be
regarded as serving only as dust excluders. Immediately
before the engine and/or aircraft first takes the air, all rubber
joints throughout the machine should be renewed, the date
of the renewal being entered in the aircraft and/or engine
Log Books.
3. New joints thus fitted may be considered serviceable
for three months from the date of fitting. They should, how-
ever, during this period, be frequently examined and renewed
if deterioration be detected.
4. After having been fitted for three months, all rubber
joints for petrol should be considered under suspicion and
should be frequently and carefully examined. Any signs of
restricted flow, collection of particles of rubber in the filter
and/or such fittings as three-way petrol cocks, must be care-
fully watched for, as an indication of the condition of the
rubber joint. At least once a month, a joint should be taken
out of the petrol system and examined internally and for
reduced adhesion between the plies. Immediately any such
deterioration is detected, the whole of the joints in the petrol
system should be replaced. In every case all rubber joints
for petrol should be renewed six months after the date of
fitting.


5. Similarly, joints in the oil and water systems should be
specially examined after having been fitted for three months,
and periodically removed, but, in these cases, they need not
be renewed until the first signs of deterioration are apparent.
In the water system, the joints that usually deteriorate most
rapidly are those through which the water flows at its highest
temperature.
6. It is pointed out that deteriorated joints can always be
detected by simple examination. Chemical and other special
tests are only required to detect liability of deterioration.
7. Great care should be taken that the result of each
examination and the date of renewal of all rubber joints, are
recorded in the Log Books. Particular care should also be
exercised that, when fitting rubber joints, all sharp edges at
ends of pipes be removed before the rubber tubing is slipped
on, as, unless this is done, damage to the interior of the
tubing will result. Consequent on such damage, particles of
rubber detected in the filters might create the impression
that exceptionally rapid disintegration is taking place.
8. All rubber connections, where stored, should be kept in
cool, dark and damp places.

1925
1. D.H.4, D.H.9 and D.H.9A Types of Aircraft:
Construction of Main Plane Spars
(545909/24)
1. The attention of Ground Engineers is directed to the
necessity for observing the following inspectional precautions
during overhaul of the main planes fitted to the above types of
aircraft.
2. Each spar should be carefully examined for general
quality of the timber, which must be one of the following :
Sitka spruce. West Virginia spruce, or Oregon pine.
3. In addition, the type of spar construction must be
specially noted, to insure its being one, or other, of the
following;—
(a) Vertically laminated spars containing two or
three laminations either continuous or with one lamina-
tion spliced ; spliced as for a solid spar ; having a half
spar of two laminations spliced to a half spar of three
laminations ; or having a solid half spar spliced to one
of two or three laminations.
(b) Horizontally laminated spars containing lamina-
tions with butt joints in the inner laminations, but
with the top and bottom laminations continuous or
containing continuous laminations throughout.

(Copies of these drawings, when necessary, may be obtained
on application from the Secretary (R.T.P.), Air Ministry,
Kingsway, W.C.2, on prepayment.)
(c) Box spars with continuous or jointed flanges and
sides. These spars are entirely covered with glued-on
fabric, which renders inspection difficult. This fabric
or taping should be examined for discoloration, which
reveals the presence of moisture. If such discoloration
be present, the entire spar should be unwrapped, as in
all probability failure of the glued joints may have
occurred. If, on the other hand, no defects are visible,
stripping of the fabric need not be made, but a careful
examination of the fabric wrapping must be made for
any signs of shakes or of broken joints.
4. All box spars must be provided with |-in. inspection
holes indicating the positions of the internal packing blocks.
If no such holes are present, |-in. holes must be drilled on one
vertical face of each spar on the neutral axis close up to and
verifying the correct positions of both ends of each packing
block.
5. Splices must be carefully examined for soundness. The
only approved types of splices are the plain scarf and the
R.A.E. type, the latter taking the form of a dovetail splice
with a central square wedge. The ‘‘bird’s mouth” type of
splice is not permitted.
6. In the event of new spars being required, these must be
made in accordance with the following drawings :


7. No Certificate of Airworthiness will be issued or renewed
in respect of any aircraft of the above types, constructed or
overhauled subsequent to the date of issue of this Notice
unless the above precautions have been observed.
(9/2/1925)
6. Siddeley “Puma” Engines: Modifications
1. The undermentioned modifications, (1) to (17), all of
which have been individually established for several years,
are considered essential and must be included in any " Puma ”
engine which does not already contain them before it is passed
as airworthy:—
(1) A horizontal groove, 4 mm. wide and 0-5 mm.
deep, should be provided in the bottom half of the big
end bearing to come within 7-5 mm. of each end.
(2) The new type oil baffles should be fitted to decrease
the oil consumption.
(3) Connecting rods with strengthened-up big ends
must be fitted.
(4) A dowel must be provided in the big end bearings
to prevent rotation.
(5) Low compression pistons, compression ratio 4 • 95-1,
are to be fitted.
(6) The new type of inlet valve outer spring, to take
load of 63J lb. as against the original spring of 55J lb.,
is to be fitted when high lift camshaft is used.
(7) The inlet valve with solid stem adjusted by cap
is to be used when high lift camshaft is fitted.
(8) The following alterations must be embodied in
the lubrication system ;
(а) Part No. 701-149.- — Oil gallery nipple. —Hole to
be opened out \ in. diameter.
(б) Part No. 701-145 A delivery pipe from filter,
—Pipe to be altered to f in. outside diameter.
(c) Part No. 701-33A/B, — Intermediate bearing (701-
34A/B centre bearing).—Hole altered to J in.
diameter and countersink altered to “10 mm.
dia. at 90°.’’
Position of oil groove in top half altered and
groove extended round oil hole. Oil groove
added in bottom half.


{d) Part No. 701-32A/B. — |
Front Bearings .. Mud groove altered to
> 2 mm. by 3 mm. in
(e) Part No. 701-35A/B. f eac h ] ia lf.
Rear Bearings..
IJ] Part No. 701-74A.— 0il 3-way piece stud. —New
part to be fitted.
As an alternative modification and in order
to adapt the existing part, two holes -f in.
diameter can be drilled at right angles to the
existing holes, one above and the other below
these holes. The new holes must not be drilled
right through, but only to the centre.
(g) Part No. 701-148 A oil gallery pipe. —Pipe
to be increased to fin. external diameter.
(h) Part No. 702-1 A holes in Nos.
3, 5 and 7 journals are to be elongated at top.
(9) The cil pressure pipes to camshaft to be bent at
the top and bottom ends, to run close and be bound to
the oil drain pipe by means of tape lagging, the tape
being subsequently varnished.
(10) The following oil pipes are to be lagged with
tape and varnished ;
701-77. —Crankcase thrust oil pipe.
701-78. —-Oil pipe front.
701-145 A delivery pipe from filter.
701-148 A- —Main oil gallery pipe.
(11) The vertical shaft coupling to be of the serrated
type instead of hexagon.
(12) The material of the union and union nuts to be
of gun metal instead of aluminium, to overcome stripping
of threads.
(13) Narrow slots for the air passages in place of large
drilled holes to be provided in the altitude control valve, in
order to limit the range of control and render the action
more gradual. Or, alternatively, the altitude control
must be rendered inoperative.
(14) Connecting rod on carburettor , interlocking vacuum
control and throttle levers, to be removed.
(15) Slow running jets. —The number of petrol feed
holes to be increased from two to four in order to obviate
undue restriction in the petrol supply.


(16) Feed holes through needle seating to be increased
from | in. to in. diameter, to increase the available
petrol flow.
(17) The drilled holes from float chamber to the diffuser
base to be increased from £ in. to -ff in., in order to
increase the petrol supply.
2. It is very desirable that all engines be fitted with two
magnetos in place of one magneto and one Remy coil ignition
set, and be fitted with new type oil base with increased radius
to underside of flange securing sump to crankcase, to prevent
cracking of flange.
3. The following modifications, (18) to (24), are desirable
modifications which should be embodied whenever possible ;
(18) The diameter of the wire of locking ring of the
gudgeon pin in piston should be increased from 14 to
12 G. and gudgeon pin shortened accordingly.
(19) The white metal of the big end hearing and con-
necting rod should be dove-tailed into the gunmetal
casing, and the fitting of the big end bearing on to the
connecting rod should be tightened to prevent same
working loose.
(20) Oil holes in camshaft and extension should be
increased from in. to /- in. diameter, and a
diameter hole dnlled through the shaft immediately
behind the rear No. 6 exhaust cam into camshaft bore.
(21) The camshaft bearing should be modified to take
die-cast white metal bush.
(22) The new design rocking lever and pins should be
fitted to eliminate number of wearing parts.
(23) Swaged type of slow-running jet should be
substituted for the earlier type having restriction
soldered into position.
(24) A small triangular notch, 5 mm. by 5 mm.,
should be cut in the leading edge on the top side of the
throttle barrel, to obtain slow running.
(2/6/1925)

5. Box Spars in D.H.4 and D.H.9 Aircraft
(791956/27)
1. The stripping and examination of box spars called for
herein must be carried out before any D.H.4 or D.H.9
aircraft is submitted for re-inspection for renewal of Certificate
of Airworthiness.
2. In addition to the inspection of box spars called for
in Notice to Ground Engineers No. 1 of the year 1925, it
will be necessary for the main planes to be opened up
sufficiently and the binding of the spars removed locally
to establish that the butt joints in the flanges and webs are
in accordance with Drawings A.D.1415 and A.D.1416 in
type and position, and that such joints are in good condition.
Any planes found to contain open or defective joints in the
box spars shall be replaced. The joints on serviceable spars
shall be re-sealed by means of glued-on tape.
3. Previous to any spare plane, containing box spars,
being fitted to the above types of aircraft, the inspectional
requirements of the preceding paragraph must be met.
4. No Certificate of Airworthiness will be issued or
renewed in respect of any aircraft of the above types,
constructed or overhauled subsequent to the date of issue
of this Notice, unless the above precautions have been
observed.

2. Tighfening Cylinder Head holding down Studs
(852910/29)
1. The attention of all ground engineers is directed to
the importance of avoiding overtightening the nuts on studs
and holts subjected to pulsating load, e.g, cylinder holding
down studs, connecting rod bolts, etc.
2. Particular attention is necessary on engines where the
cylinders and/or heads are retained by long external studs,
it being essential in all such cases that due allowance is made
when tightening the nuts, for the increased tension on the
studs which will arise when the engine is heated.
3. No attempt should be made to remedy a leaky joint
between a cylinder and cylinder head on such engines by
overtightening the nuts as this will invariably lead to the
parts being subjected to excessive loads and distortion.
All such leaks should be rectified by attention to the joint
itself.
(8/1/1929)


9. Westland “Widgeon” Aircraft: Essential Modifications
(906137/29)
1. The modification described herein must be satisfactorily
incorporated in all Westland “Widgeon” aircraft before any
such aircraft is submitted for inspection for issue or renewal
of a Certificate of Airworthiness.
2. Fuel Tank.
The fuel tank is to be modified in accordance with Drawing
No. A.R. 1418. This modification, which is necessitated by
the possibility, with the present arrangement, of a stoppage
of the fuel flow, due to the collection of vapour on the fuel
tank gauze, may be briefly described as follows:
(a) A stack pipe is to be sweated into the existing
elbow of the tank sump.
(b) A 22 S.W.G. re-inforcing plate is to be bolted and
sweated to the bottom of the sump for elbow fixing.
(c) The wire gauze at the bottom of the tank, above
the sump, is to be pierced with f in holes all round the
stack pipe; these holes can be conveniently made with a
pointed steel rod through the filler.
(d) The fuel filter is to be of Air Ministry type (A.G .S.
No, 600) with cleaning connections.
3. Fuel Tank Supporting Cables.
All existing 5 cwt. cables supporting the fuel tank in the
main plane are to be replaced by standard 10 cwt. cables at
the earliest opportunity.
4. No Certificate of Airworthiness will be issued or renewed
in respect of any Westland “Widgeon” aircraft unless the
above-mentioned modifications have been satisfactorily
incorporated.
(18/3/1929)
19. Doping of Civil Aircraft
(891625/28)
1. The attention of all ground engineers is drawn to the
necessity of strict compliance with paragraph 19 (g) of
the Air Navigation Directions, 1932 (A.N.D. 11), which requires
that operations such as doping must be carried out by methods
approved by the Secretary of State.
2. The “ approved ” doping schemes normally require
the dope to be applied in an atmosphere absolutely free from
draughts and at a minimum temperature of 65° F


3. When such conditions are not attainable, doping is
not permissible nnless recourse is had to special “ approved ”
doping schemes which cater for wider ranges of temperature
and humidity. The manufacturer concerned issues full
instructions as to the manner and conditions of application
and such instructions must be strictly adhered to.
4. All instructions for the application of " approved ”
doping schemes bear a reference to the approval authority.
(3/9/1929, Revised 1/3/1933)
24. Advertising Streamers and Banners on Aircraft
(934775/29)
The attention of ground engineers and all concerned
who contemplate attaching streamers or advertising banners
to aircraft is drawn to the fact that the attachment of such
banners is considered to be a modification which affects the
safety of the aircraft. No such banner shall be fitted until
approval has been given as required by Paragraph 35 of
the Air Navigation Directions, 1932 (A.N.D. II).
(25/11/1929, Revised 1/3/1933)
1930
3. Palmer Landing Wheels
(800 mm. x 150 mm, and over)
(956154/29)
1. A number of Palmer wheels of sizes of, or greater than,
800 mm. by 150 mm. issued prior to 1925 and still in use are
of the old type on which the rim is not provided with reinforcing
rods.
2. There is a tendency, in the event of a heavy landing
accompanied by side-drift, for the rims on wheels of this
type to open out. If this opening out becomes considerable
there is danger of the tyre coming off.
3. Ground engineers should examine any wheels of this
kind on aircraft under their charge and if the overall width
of the rims has increased by a \ in. the wheel should be
replaced by a new one.
(29/1/1930)


6. Safety Belts and Safety Harness
(2355/30)
The attention of aircraft owners, ground engineers and
all concerned, is drawn to the requirements of the Air Naviga-
tion Directions, 1932 (A.N.D. 11), with regard to the provision
and maintenance of safety belts in civil aircraft. These are
as follow :—•
(i) Paragraph 63 (1) (i) (a) calls for the provision,
in all flying machines, of a safety belt for each person,
including the pilot, carried in an open cockpit, and for the
pilot or pilots, whether carried in an open cockpit or not.
(ii) Safety belts are regarded as part of the equipment
of the aircraft, and both the belt itself and its attachment
to the aircraft are, therefore, included in the items to be
inspected and certified by a ground engineer licensed in
Category “ A ” in accordance with paragraphs 54 (a) and
55 (1) (a) of A.N.D. 11. In any case in which it is sus-
pected that the strength of the safety belt has deteriorated,
the ground engineer should remove the belt from the
aircraft, support it by any convenient means in a manner
similar to that in which it is attached in the aircraft, and
apply a proof load of 300 lbs. by loading the centre of
the belt.
(iii) Where ropes are used for attaching the belts to
the aircraft, the strength of the rope should be approxi-
mately 14 cwts. “ Lapped ” joints in ropes are con-
sidered unsatisfactory and the use of ropes which allow
of a spliced or “ whipped ” joint is more satisfactory.
In all cases of “ whipping ”, good quality kite cord
should be used, and, in order to minimise the slip when
the rope is subjected to subsequent strain, the “ whipping ''
should be carried out while the joint is under tension.
All loose ends of ropes should be “ served ” to prevent
fraying, and in no case should a rope be connected
directly to a plate where chafing may occur.
(iv) Anchorage plates, where secured by bolts, should
be so arranged that the shear is taken at the bolt head
rather than the screwed end, as cases have arisen where the
plates bearing on the screwed end have sheared the bolt.
The minimum diameter of any bolt used in anchorage
fittings should be 2.8. A. The fixing of an anchorage
plate or connection to the middle of a structural member
should be avoided, and the belt be so arranged as to
sustain the upper part of the body.
(v) The release gear on the belt should always be
correctly positioned for easy manipulation, and should
be maintained in a lubricated condition.
(22/3/1930, Revised 1/4/1934)


8. Blackburn “Bluebird” Mk. IV Aircraft: Pins in
Connecting Bod between Control Sticks for Aileron Control
(16336/30)
1. The attention of aircraft owners and ground engineers
is drawn to the above mentioned pins, which are not to
exceed • 470 in. in length under the head.
2. The connecting rod, housed within the elevator rock
shaft, is attached to the control sticks by \ in. diameter pins
and to the aileron connecting rod by a in. diameter pin.
The pins are opposite flattened rivet heads inside the rockshaft
tube, providing a fine internal clearance, Aircraft owners
and ground engineers should examine this component part
to ensure that pins of the correct length are fitted and that
adequate clearance is provided in all positions of the control
stick.
3. The modification is shown on Saunders-Roe, Ltd.,
drawings Nos. N.A. 1502/4 and 1603/5, copies of which can
be obtained on application to the Blackburn Aeroplane and
Motor Co., Brough, East Yorks.
4. The appropriate part numbers for pins of the correct
length are: —
Part 8, Drg. No. N.A. 1603/5.
Part 4, Drg, No. N.A. 1502/4. Part No. 383/51.
(3/4/1930)
9. Inspection Tabs on Control and Bracing Cables
(15129/30)
1. In the case of all aircraft fitted with inspection tabs
in the eyes of splices of control or bracing cables, the following
action should be taken.
2. Movement of the inspection tabs, and consequent
chafing of the thimble and/or cable, must be prevented by
securing the tabs alongside the turnbuckle or cable by wire
or other suitable means.
3. Examination shall be made of all tabbed cable eyes,
special attention being directed to cables which normally
are hidden, and any loose tabs must be secured as indicated
above.

13. High Tensile Steel Fork-Joints A.G.S. 168 to 178 and
High Tensile Steel Turnbuckles A.G.S. 138 to 149
(21947/30)
1. High tensile steel fork-joints A.G.S. 168-178 have been
found unsafe and their use on any aircraft is prohibited.
Ground engineers should, therefore, take steps to replace any
such fork-joints which are incorporated in aircraft or held
as spares by mild steel fork-joints conforming to A.G.S. 412-
422, B.E.S.A. Specification S.P. 3, or Stainless Steel fork-
joints to A.G.S. 678-689.
2. The following table gives the A.G.S. numbers of the
prohibited H.T.S. fork-joints and of the M.S. and S.S. fork-
joints which replace them :
M.S. fork-joints 412-422 are identified by the flats on the
ends of the forks, together with the counterboring which ex-
tends down each side of the fork gap, and those of S.S. to
A.G.S. 678-689 are similar but have no collar on the barrel,
whereas the original H.T.S. fork-joints A.G.S. 168-178 are
readily distinguished by the small ribs at the sides of the pin
holes.
3. The use of high tensile steel turnbuckles, A.G.S. 138-
149, on civil aircraft is still permitted, but, as these turn-
buckles are all of war-time manufacture, they should be care-
fully re-inspected to ensure that no faults have developed
during service. The particular defects to be guarded against
are fine hair cracks and flaws in the steel ends, and season-
cracking of the barrels. (This class of turnbuckle may be
readily identified by the A.G.S. number stamped on each
turnbuckle.)
4. When replacing any high tensile steel turnbuckle by a
mild steel turnbuckle conforming to A.G.S. 490-497, particu-
lar care should be taken to ensure that the former is replaced
by its equivalent in the latter class. The following table

gives, in each class, the respective A.G.S. numbers of the
turn buckles which are interchangeable in respect of strength
and diameter of pin :
Note. —The one exception is M.S. turnbuckle A.G.S. 490
for which no strictly interchangeable H.T.S. size exists, as
A.G.S. 138 and 139, which it replaces, were made with two
eye-ends only and not with the customary fork and eye-ends.
5. No Certificates of Airworthiness will be issued, or
existing Certificates of Airworthiness renewed, in respect of
any aircraft on which high tensile steel fork joints are fitted.
(1/5/1930)
17. Radio Receiving Sets in Civil Aircraft
(959119/29)
1. Where radio receiving apparatus is voluntarily carried
in aircraft when not required by the Air Navigation Directions,
1932 (A.N.D. II), para. 65, such receiving apparatus need not
he of an. approved type.
2. The installation of such apparatus does, however,
constitute a modification of the aircraft, as prescribed in
A.N.D. 11, para. 35, and approval of the method of installation
is necessary.
(19/5/1930, Revised 1/4/1934)
25. Ground Engineers Licensed in Categories “A” and “C”:
Distinction between Duties
(44808/30)
1. The Air Navigation Directions, 1932 (A.N.D. 11) stipu-
late that the certification of an aircraft, in accordance with
paragraph 8 of Schedule If of the Air Navigation Order,
shall he made, in respect of the aircraft itself, by a ground
engineer licensed in category “ A ” and in respect of the
engines and engine installations, by a ground engineer
licensed in category " C
2. When a certificate of safety for flight for any aircraft
in respect of both aircraft and engine(s) is given by one
ground engineer licensed in both " A " and " C ” categories
no question arises in respect of the responsibility incident
to one or other of the duties concerned. The question of


the limits of responsibility does arise, however, when the
certification is made by two separate individuals licensed in
the separate categories.
3. In order that there shall be no doubt regarding the
distinction between these duties the following instructions
are promulgated :
[a] The inspection to be performed by the ground
engineer licensed in category “A” includes :
(i) the whole of the aircraft structure (including
fuselage or hull, wings, ailerons, slots, tail plane,
elevators, fins, rudder, undercarriage, struts, bracings
and airscrew) for condition and correct assembly.
(ii) all flying controls for assembly and correct
functioning.
(iii) the flying instruments (aneroid, airspeed indi-
cator, turn indicator and compass, where applicable)
for installation and correct functioning.
(iv) aircraft equipment (safety belts and electrical
services with their batteries, wiring and bonding for
W/T) for correct installation.
(b) The inspection to be performed by the ground
engineer licensed in categorj? “ C ” includes :
(i) the whole of the engine installations, including the
engine with its accessories and the fuel, oil, cooling,
ignition, exhaust and starting systems, for condition,
installation, correct functioning, and power output.
(ii) all controls connected with the engine and its
ancillary systems for assembly and correct functioning.
(iii) the instruments relating to the engine and its
installation (revolution indicator, pressure and contents
gauges and temperature indicator) for installation and
correct functioning.
(iv) the airscrew for correct attachment and smooth-
ness of running.
(29/7/1930, Revised 1/3/1933)
30. Slackness in the Operating Mechanism of Flying Controls
(47291/30)
1. The attention of aircraft owners, ground engineers
and all concerned is drawn to the fact that slackness in the
operating mechanism of flying controls may, under certain
circumstances, give rise to flutter either of the wing aileron
system or of the tail unit.
2. Frequent examination of control systems should be
made, and immediate steps taken to remedy slackness when
found.
(9/8/1930)


32. Cirrus and Gipsy Crankcases:
Examination for Cracks in Main Bearing Housings
(50189/30)
1. Generally after long periods of running, slight cracks
sometimes develop in the main bearing housings of Cirrus
and Gipsy engine crankcases, running from the inner edge of
the joint face down the bore of the main bearing housing
in a line with the axis of the bearing cap stud.
2. If not dealt with, such cracks, initially unimportant,
are likely to extend with further prolonged running, and
eventually produce a slackening of the bearing stud and the
scrapping of the crankcase.
3. At each complete overhaul and/or when other oppor-
tunity occurs, a close examination of each main bearing
housing should, therefore, be made through a suitable
magnifying lens.
4. Provided any cracks so found, measured from the inner
edge of the joint face, do not exceed £ in. length on the port or
oil feed side of the housing, and/or | in. length on the opposite
side of the housing, they should be dealt with as follows :
5. After carefully locating the end of the crack, remove
the adjacent bearing cap stud and drill a hole in. diameter
at the end of the crack through to the stud hole at an angle
following so far as can be ascertained the transverse line of
the crack. Finally remove all trace of drillings and burrs
from the inside of the stud hole and carefully refit the stud.
6. A suitable entry recording the repair is to be made in
the log book.
7. Crankcases with cracks exceeding the lengths specified
in (4) above should be treated as unserviceable.
(22/9/1930)
36. Repair of Civil Aircraft Abroad
(42763/30)
1. The Air Navigation Directions, 1932 (A.N.D. 11),
Sect. V sets out the requirements, in connection with the
repair or overhaul of an aircraft, which must be complied
with if the aircraft in question is to retain its British certificate
of airworthiness.
2. Occasions may arise when it may be necessary to effect
in a foreign country repairs to, or an overhaul of, a British
aircraft. On such occasions the following procedure will
apply.


3. It must be established ;
(a) That the work of repair or overhaul is carried out
to drawings which are identical with those on which the
type approval is based, or to any approved repair scheme.
( b ) That the materials used in this work are equal to
those authorised for the type design.
(c) That approved inspection of the work of repair or
overhaul is carried out and is properly certified.
4. With regard to 3 ( a) and (5) it may happen that the
company or individual doing the work may be able to obtain
the required drawings from the “ parent ” firm (i.e. the con-
structors of the aircraft), or they may prepare, from other
available data, drawings and/or specifications which could be
submitted to the parent firm for consideration. The require-
ments under these headings will be satisfied only when the
company doing the work has submitted to the parent firm a
certified list of the drawings used (if these are known drawings),
or copies of the drawings and/or specifications (if these are
not known to the parent firm) and when the parent firm has
certified that these drawings and/or specifications are in all
essential respects similar to those approved for the type
aircraft.
With regard to 3 ( c ) the requirements will be met when
the work has been inspected and certified by a recognised
Inspection Authority.
5. When any British aircraft has been repaired or over-
hauled abroad, the existing certificate of airworthiness will
remain valid only when the certificates as to drawings,
specifications, and workmanship mentioned in the preceding
paragraph have been obtained. Further, these certificates
must be produced for examination by the Inspector on the
occasion of the inspection of the aircraft for the next renewal
of its certificate of airworthiness.
(14/10/1930, Revised 1/3/1933)
38. Heating Systems of Cockpits and Cabins
(61387/30)
1. The attention of aircraft owners, ground engineers and
all concerned is drawn to the fact that heating systems which
depend on jacketted exhaust pipes may, under certain cir-
cumstances, develop leaks which will enable exhaust gases
containing carbon monoxide to enter the cabin or cockpit.
2. Frequent examination of the exhaust pipes concerned
should be made, particularly of the portions within the
jacket or muff, to ensure that they are adequately gas-tight.
(17/10/1930)


42. Avio 504.K and 604.N Aircraft: Discontinuous Elevators
(66642/30)
The requirements regarding discontinuous elevators, as set
out in Design Leaflet 8.4 of Air Publication 1208, are not
applicable to aircraft of the above types.
(12/11/1930, Revised 1/3/1933)
1931
1. Marconi-Newton Constant Speed Windmills
(60361/30)
1. When Marconi-Newton Constant Speed Windmills,
types 110, 140, 160 and 180, are employed for driving
aircraft generators installed on aircraft flying with a Certificate
of Airworthiness, it is essential that the following instructions
be observed to ensure the correct functioning of their
regulating mechanism.
2. The windmills are to be tested before each flight for
freedom of the blades. For this purpose the blades are to be
turned against the force of the internal springs in the direction
to coarsen their pitch, care being taken that the blades are
gripped as near as possible to the centre to avoid damaging or
distorting the blades.
3. The windmills are to be lubricated after approximately
every 20 hours flying by means of a few drops only of very
light machine oil introduced into the hole provided.
(9/1/1931 revised 1/4/1934)
2. Blackburn Bluebird Mk. IV Aircraft:
Top Longeron Fitting
(60361/30)
1. Cases have occurred of the fitting Part No. N.D.134,
cracking along the bend lines. This fitting is situated on
the after side of the fireproof bulkhead and forms the top
longeron joint on both port and starboard sides.
2. These joints should, therefore, be inspected imme-
diately for signs of cracks, and further inspection should be
carried out at frequent intervals.
3. An improved design of fitting, Part No. 5.K.3443, has
been produced by The Blackburn Aeroplane and Motor
Company, Brough, East Yorkshire.
4. In the event of failure being detected, Part S.K. 3443
should be substituted for part N.D. 134.

18. Westland Widgeon Aircraft: Wing Hinge Joints
(60361/30)
1. The attention of aircraft owners and ground engineers
is drawn to Modification Widgeon/13, Wing Hinge Joints.
2. Owing to the distortion which sometimes takes place
at the hinge joints on Widgeon aircraft due to repeated
folding and assembly of the wings, it is considered desirable
to replace all existing hinge fittings by the new type introduced
by the above modification,
3. The new hinge fittings must in all cases be incorporated
before the next renewal of the Certificate of Airworthiness.
In cases where the hinges are already distorted or the attach-
ment bolts are bent, the modification must be introduced
immediately.
4. The necessary new parts can be obtained on application
to Messrs. Westland Aircraft Works, Yeovil.
(26/1/1931)


17. “Armour” Wind Direction Indicator:
(33985/30)
1. The smoke producing devices and their method of use
described in letters patent No. 326161 are approved by the
Secretary of State under the terms of paragraph 127 (2) (a)
of the Air Navigation Directions, 1932 (A.N.D. 11).
2. The glass cylinders containing a chemical substance,
forming part of these devices, must not be carried inside
cockpits or cabins of aircraft, nor in such a position on board
that, in the event of breakage, the contents will cause incon-
venience or injury to the occupants.
(4/2/1931, Revised 1/3/1933)
19. D.H.80A “Puss Moth” Aircraft:
Attachment of Tail Skid
(60361/30)
1. A modification to the above-mentioned aircraft has
been introduced by the constructors, The de Havilland Air-
craft Co., Ltd. The Modification, No. 169, consists of sub-
stituting an improved washer plate, Part No. H. 32275, for
the original washer plate on the fin post, which washer plate
takes the top attachment of the tail skid. The original
washer plate was flat and was made from 18 S.W.G. plate.
The improved washer plate is made from 14 S.W.G. plate and
has two J-in. flanges which fold round the sides of the fin post.
2. The introduction of the above modification is considered
to be desirable in the case of all “ Puss Moth ” aircraft in
which it is not already incorporated. The Certificate of
Airworthiness of the earlier “ Puss Moth ” aircraft were
made valid for a maximum permissible all-up weight of
1,9001 b., but when the modification described above is incor-
porated, the maximum all-up weight may be increased to
2,0501 b.
3. The necessary parts should be obtained from The de
Havilland Aircraft Co., Ltd., Hatfield Aerodrome, Herts.
(14/2/1931)
20. De Havilland Aircraft: Fireproof Bulkheads
(67945/30)
1. With reference to the requirements of para. 1, sub-
para. (i) of Design Leaflet G.l, a number of de Havilland
aircraft of the types D.H.60, D.H.6OX, D.H.6OG, D.H.61
and D.H.66 have been fitted with fireproof bulkheads


constructed of /-j-in. asbestos riveted or bolted between
24 gauge aluminium sheet in front and 1J m/m. three-ply
behind.
2, Recent tests have shown that this bulkhead is satis-
factory and it is not necessary, therefore, to modify such
bulkheads on aircraft of the above types in order to satisfy
the conditions for renewal of Certificates of Airworthiness.
(26/2/1931, Revised 1/4/1934)
24. Modification to Sutton Harness
(93324/31)
1. A case has occurred in which a fatal accident was
attributed to a Sutton harness becoming unfastened during
flight as the result of bending of the two-pronged safety pin,
and its subsequent failure to hold the release pin in place,
2. In the case of all aircraft in which a Sutton harness
is fitted, as complying with the requirements of A.N.D.11,
paragraph 63 (1) (i) (a), immediate steps should be taken to
replace the two-pronged safety pin by the three-pronged type.
3. The parts necessary for this conversion are given
hereunder and may be obtained from Messrs. Mills Equipment
Company, Limited, Victoria Street, Westminster.
Safety pin, to Drawing No.: A.D.9745/1.
Lanyard, to Drawing No. : A.D.9745/2.
Release pin, to Drawing No.: A.D.9426/1.
Screw, to Drawing No.: A.D. 9426/2.
4. No Certificate of Airworthiness will be renewed unless
the above modification has been satisfactorily incorporated.
(7/4/1931, Revised. 1/3/1933)
25. D.H. 60 X, G & M “Moth” Aircraft:
Main Plane Locking Bolts
(60361/30)
1. It has been found that there is a possibility of the
bottom front spar locking bolt, part No. H. 18988, failing to
fully engage the rear lug of the fuselage fitting. This
results in a tendency for the bolt to ride forward on the taper
under load.
2. All aircraft of the above type are to be examined in
order to verify that the parallel portion of the locking bolt
passes right through the rear lug.


3. If the bolt does not fit correctly this may be due to the
rear lug of the bracket carrying the locking bolt having
become bent forward. Should it prove impossible to rectify
the trouble by bending the bracket, a new locking bolt of the
same overall length but with shorter taper end, is to be
fitted.
4. The modified locking bolts, part No. H. 18988, Issue 9,
can be obtained from The de Havilland Aircraft Co., Ltd.,
Hatfield Aerodrome, Herts.
(9/4/1931)
27. “Petroflex” Tubing and Jointing
(80371/31)
1. The following precautions should be observed when
using “ Petroflex ” tubing :
(i) The ends of piping or connections to be joined
by means of “ Petroflex ” should be parallel, with sharp
edges removed.
(ii) Pipes should enter the short lengths of " Petroflex ”
up to the first corrugation, but no further.
(iii) On no account must the lining of the tubing be
stretched or contracted by attempting to fit it to connec-
tions of a size other than that for which it was manu-
factured.
(iv) Ends of " Petroflex ” joints should be slightly
bell-mouthed (to the extent of approximately 1/16")
in order to prevent the lining from being forced back
or injured when assembling.
(v) Care should be taken not to twist or disarrange
the tubing during assembly.
(vi) Gold size may be applied to the connections
before fitting the tubing, as this facilitates assembly
and makes a good joint. On no account, however,
should soft soap or oil be used as a lubricant for this
purpose.

34. Napier “Lion” Engines:
Tightening of Nuts on Master Connecting Bods
(17765/30)
1. The attention of aircraft owners and ground engineers
is directed to the special care necessary when tightening the
nuts on master connecting rod studs on Napier “ Lion "
engines.
2. These nuts must be sufficiently tight to hold the
bearing cap securely under running conditions, but not so
tight as to cause stretching of the studs. To ensure this
correct tension, the engine makers employ a spring loaded
spanner set to give a maximum loading of 945in./lb. (1351 b.
at 7 in. radius).
3. It is very desirable to use a spanner such as that
referred to in paragraph (2), but when this is not available
a box spanner and a tommy bar can be used, the latter not to
exceed 7-J-in. measured from the centre of the box spanner,
and the total length of the bar not to be in excess of 8f in.
The nuts must be tightened by applying a steady pressure to
the spanner.
4. If any correction is necessary in order to obtain align-
ment between the split pin hole in the stud and the castellation
of the nut, this must be effected by removing the nut and
facing off the bottom face, care being taken that a true
surface is obtained between this face of the nut and the
bearing cap. {NoU: -010 in. removed from the face of the
nut will allow it to be tightened down one-sixth of a turn).
A special tool, Part No. 48263, for facing the nuts is to be
used exclusively for this operation ; on no account are the
nuts to be filed. If in the process of facing the nut too much
metal is removed, so that the split pin slot goes slightly past
its proper position, the nut must on no account be slackened
back to enable the split pin to be fitted ; either another nut
must be used or the nut must be faced down still more until
the next slot comes into the correct position. Any nuts
having slots which do not register correctly with the hole in
the stud should be rejected.
5. Each split pin must closely fit the hole in the con-
necting rod stud. When the nut is correctly tightened there
should be no clearance between the pin and the slot of the
nut as would permit of any slackening of the nut. Split
pins should not be more than | in. long in the parallel portion,
and when fitted the ends are to be opened and turned over
the nut so that no movement of the pin can occur.
6. Studs for the “ Lion ” master connecting rod are now
made from steel to B.E.S.A. Specification 5.65. When any
replacements are necessary, studs of this material, which


are identifiable by a saw cut across the end, should be used.
At the engine makers, these studs are driven with a spring
loaded spanner set to give a maximum loading of 840 in. /lb.
(1201 b. at 7 in. radius). Alternatively, if a spring loaded
spanner is not available, the box spanner and tommy bar
referred to in paragraph (3) may be used.
7. To remove a stud, first drill out the locking pin, using
a £ in. drill. Care is necessary during this operation as there
is a risk of the drill running out to one side and breaking.
The pin having been drilled out, the stud may be very care-
fully withdrawn. Should there be any tendency of the stud
to seize in the rod during withdrawal, the operation should
be stopped before the threads in the rod suffer damage, and
the stud must then be drilled out, using a drill of the correct
tapping size, namely, in. This latter operation is one
demanding extreme care in order to avoid damage to the
threads in the rod. The new stud should be a tight fit in the
rod throughout its length. The stud should be screwed down
until the bottom of the hole for the split pin is not less than
I in. from the shoulder of the rod, and the top of the hole not
more than 1 in., the hole lying parallel with the axis of the
bore of the rod.
8. When the stud is in position it should be drilled for
the locking pin, which is made from a short length of No. 10
S.W.G. mild steel wire. The pin must be of such a length
that it is slightly counter-sunk when in position, the edge of
the pin hole in the connecting rod being slightly peened over
to retain the pin in position.

38. Mk. I Cirrus-Hermes Engines
(95422/31)
1. Modification No. H.M.109.—-Auxiliary Cylinder
Lubrication. —(i) To ensure adequate cylinder lubrication and
to assist in the cooling and general running conditions, a
sV in. diameter oil hole is now drilled in four of the plugs
located in the crank webs, as shown on drawing C.A.47.


Crankshaft oil retainers and piston scraper rings as listed
below are also fitted :
No. off per
Part No. Description. engine.
C. 453 .. Crankshaft oil retainer 4
C.371A .. Piston scraper ring 4
(Li) This modification should be incorporated in engines
during the next overhaul.
(iii) Fitting of the parts concerned is fully explained on
drawing C.A.47, referred to above.
2. Modification No. H.MAI2. — Valves. —(i) A
strengthened exhaust valve of modified form to Part No.
C.160A has been introduced by modification No. H.M.112
and it is desirable that valves of this type be fitted to engines
at the first convenient opportunity. In any case they should
be fitted during the next top overhaul.
(ii) The number of the engine for which parts arc required
must be stated.
3. When the modifications referred to in paras. 1 and 2
have been incorporated, the name plate attached to the
engine should be marked accordingly, i.e., “ Engine No. 000 ”
should be amended to read “ Engine No. 000/Mod. Mark II.”
The data sheet and title page of the engine log book
should also be suitably amended.
4. Modification No. H.M.109 has already been carried
out on a few Mk. I engines and the marking “ M.I ” has been
stamped on the crankcase adjacent to the name plate, on
engines so modified. When modification No. H.M.112 has
also been incorporated in these engines, they should have
the mark “ M.I ” obliterated and be re-marked as described
in paragraph (3).
5. Exhaust Manifold and Engine Cowling. —(i) Aircraft
owners and ground engineers are advised that to ensure
satisfactory functioning of the Cirrus-Hermes engine, the
cylinder cowling and exhaust manifold should conform to
the requirements of designs prepared by the makers.
(ii) The following is a list of drawings from which the
necessary particulars can be obtained:—■
Closed type engine cowline. Drawing No. C.A.42.
Open „ „ „ „ ~ C.A.43.
Exhaust manifold. ~ „ C.353C.
(iii) Owing to the possibility of engine cowlings being
damaged or distorted when removed during overhaul, they
should be examined and corrected if necessary, as otherwise
the cooling of the cylinders may be seriously affected.


6. Copies of the drawings referred to in this Notice,
together with modified engine parts, can be obtained from
the engine makers.
(11/7/1931)
40. Gipsy II and in Engines
(124136/31)
1. It has been noticed that, in the case of the above
engines, there is a tendency for the thread of the bolts securing
the rocker brackets to the cylinder head to stretch in service,
which may lead to a mechanical breakdown. The constructors.
The de Havilland Aircraft Company Ltd., of Stag Lane
Aerodrome, Edgware, have therefore introduced a stronger
nut and a longer bolt.
2. The bolts in question can be easily changed without
removing the engine, and it is considered desirable that the
new bolts and nuts should be fitted as soon as possible.
3. Engines fitted with rocker covers having the hasp type
fasteners, require 12 bolts Part No. 1302/368 and 12 nuts
Part No. 1302/65. Engines fitted with the later type rocker
covers with central screw fastening, require 8 bolts Part No.
1302/368, 4 bolts Part No. 1302/61A, and 12 nuts Part No.
1302/65. In either case 12 new split pins will be required.
4. These bolts and nuts can be obtained on application to
The de Havilland Aircraft Co. Ltd., Hatfield Aerodrome,
Herts.
5. The engine log book should be endorsed to show the
incorporation of the modification.
(31/7/1931)
43. Westland “Widgeon” Aircraft: Flying Controls
(60361/30)
1. Attention is drawn to Modification Widgeon/14,
Flying Controls (adjustable type rudder bar foot rests
strengthened).
2. Should the outside of one of the present adjustable
rudder bar foot rests become seriously distorted in service,
there is a possibility of it jamming against the side bracing
member of the fuselage. The above-mentioned modification
arranges for strengthening angle brackets to be fitted to both
sides of the foot rests, in order to avoid this possibility.


3. The above modification must be incorporated in all
aircraft that are affected within six months of the date of
this Notice in order that the Certificate of Airworthiness of
the aircraft shall remain valid. Certificates of Airworthiness
will not be renewed and ground engineers must not sign
Daily Certificates for such aircraft after the expiration of the
aforementioned period unless the modification has been
correctly embodied.
4. The necessary new parts can be obtained on application
to Messrs. Westland Aircraft Works (Branch of Petters Ltd.),
Westland Works, Yeovil, Somerset.

50. Use of Aircraft for Towing Gliders
(119966/31)
1. Only aircraft specifically approved for the purpose are
to be used for towing gliders.
2. When such approval is required application is to be
made in the first instance to the Secretary, Air Ministry
(C.A.2), Adastral House, Kingsway, London, W.C.2, and at
the same time full details of the proposed scheme are to be
forwarded to the Chief Superintendent, Royal Aircraft
Establishment, Farnborough, marked for the attention of the
Airworthiness Department.
3. Before approval Is given it will be ascertained that the
structure has an adequate margin of strength under loads
from the towing cable, and that the control of the aircraft will
not be endangered when the pull on the aircraft from the
towing cable acts in any reasonably probable direction.
4. A weal!; link, which shall break at some predetermined
load, is to be included in the towing cable near its point of
attachment to the towing aircraft, the load referred to being
fixed after consideration of the details of the towing arrange-
ment proposed.
5. Quick releases, under the control of the pilots of the
aircraft and glider respectively, are to be fitted at both ends
of the towing cable.
6. Suitable provision is to he made to guard against the
tow rope fouling any part of the aircraft, both when under
load and when released or slackened by the glider overtaking
the aircraft.

If should be particularly noted that parachutes stained,
by acid are to be classified as unserviceable and should he
returned to the makers for repair before being again put into
service. It should also be noted that parachutes must not in
any circumstances be packed whilst in a damp condition.

18. Airscrew Designs Approved for Desoutter Aircraft
(46117/30)
Airscrews to the following designs have been approved for
use on Desoutter aircraft: —
(20/4/1932)
14. Pitting of Unapproved Airscrews
(124790/31)
(1) Owners of aircraft are reminded that where an air-
craft is fitted with any airscrew which has not been approved
for airworthiness purposes by the Air Ministry for that
particular type of aircraft, the aircraft may not be flown
with such airscrew until Air Ministry approval for its use
has been obtained, except in so far as the aircraft may be
flown without a Certificate of Airworthiness under the Air
Navigation (Consolidation) Order, 1923 and the Directions
issued thereunder.
(2) Formal application for such approval should be sub-
mitted to The Secretary (C.A.2), Air Ministry, details, etc.,
of the airscrew at the same time being forwarded to Air-
worthiness Department, Royal Aircraft Establishment, South
Farnborough, Hants.
(25/4/1932)


16. Fairey-Reed Airscrews:
Periodical Examination for Defects
(60361/30)
(1) Instances have occurred of transverse fatigue failure of
the blade sheet of Fairey-Reed airscrews fitted with metal
hub blocks, the fractures commencing at the holes for the
hub bolts or the tubular bolts securing the metal blocks, and
extending towards the leading and trailing edges.
(2) An instance has also occurred of transverse fatigue
failure commencing from the identification stamping. It
should be noted, however, that this failure occurred only on
an early airscrew where the particulars were deeply im-
pressed transversely on the front face of the blades. All
airscrews subsequent to F.R. 776 have these impressions
effected longitudinally on or near one edge of the sheet near
the centre.
(3) As the result of these failures, it is necessary that, in
future, frequent inspection of these airscrews in the vicinity
of the hub blocks and identification stamping be made.
(4) The blade sheet must be carefully examined on both
sides in the above-mentioned regions. Where metal hub
blocks are fitted, both sides of the blade sheet visible through
the lightening holes must also be examined.
(5) For this purpose, airscrews must be removed from their
hubs, and spinners, where fitted, removed from the airscrews.
In no circumstances, however, may the hub blocks be removed
from the airscrew.
(6) Airscrews on which any signs of fracture are observed,
must be removed from the aircraft and the matter reported.
(25/4/1932)
16. Manufacture and Inspection of Aircraft Parts and Approval
of Materials for the Repair or Overhaul of Licensed Aircraft
(160246/32)
(1) Attention is drawn to the requirements of Section
V, paragraph 57, sub-paragraph (1) of the Air Navigation
Directions, 1932 (A.N.D. 11),
(2) (i) The attention of aircraft owners and ground
engineers is again drawn to the fact that cases have occurred
where
(a) defective parts had been replaced by parts manu-
factured without reference to drawings, the defective
part being used as a pattern, or


( h) details or components for which no certificate of
inspection could be produced had been embodied
in an aircraft in respect of which a certificate of
airworthiness was current or had been applied for.
In the latter cases, parts had been obtained from
surplus stocks thrown up by the Royal Air Force,
or from various sources other than the manu-
facturer.
(ii) In circumstances such as those referred to in (i),
there is considerable risk of the new part being made to
incorrect dimensions and/or of incorrect materials.
(iii) In every case where it is necessary to manufacture
any detail or component of an aircraft for which a certificate
of airworthiness has been issued or is to be issued or renewed,
such replacements must be manufactured and inspected to
approved drawings.
(iv) Certification of any repair affecting the safety of an
aircraft under paragraph 58, sub-section (1) of the Air Navi-
gation Directions, 1932 (A.N.D. 11) should not be made unless
either
(a) the replacement part has been approved by the makers
of the aircraft,
(b ) the part has been manufactured and inspected to
standard approved drawings (approved repair
schemes issued by certain makers coming under
this head), or
(c) the repair has been approved as a “ modification
subsequent to the issue of a certificate of air-
worthiness ” under the procedure described in
paragraph 35 of A.N.D. 11.
The above conditions will not apply in circumstances
covered by the first proviso to paragraph 57 ; such circum-
stances could be held to have arisen, for example, if damage
was sustained in a region so remote that permanent repair
or replacement was impossible.
(3) The existence of an inspection stamp is not, in itself,
sufficient evidence of approval of materials, details or com-
ponents ; Release Notes and/or Certificates of Material Tests
are also required, and these documents should be held avail-
able for examination when the aircraft is next re-inspected
for the renewal of the certificate of airworthiness.
(4) Ground Engineers licensed only in Categories " A ”
and “ C ” are reminded that they are not empowered to
certify repairs or overhauls.
(26/4/1932, Revised 1/3/1933)


17. Gyroplanes: Validity of
Ground Engineers’ Licences in Categories A and B
(178749/32)
(1) Ground Engineers’ Licences in Categories A and B
endorsed in general terms (e.g. “ Landplanes ”, “ Single
Engine Landplanes ”, " All Heavier-than-air Aircraft ”,
etc.), do not empower ground engineers to issue daily certi-
ficates of safety for flight in respect of Gyroplanes, or to
certify overhauls, repairs, etc., in respect of such aircraft.
(2) Ground Engineers intending to operate with Gyro-
planes are required to obtain a special licence endorsement
to cover this class of aircraft, for which purpose application
should he made to the Secretary, Air Ministry (C.A.2), Adastral
House, Kingsway, W.C.2.
(29/4/1932)
20. Cinus-Hermes Engines: Main Bearing Caps
(144366/31)
(1) Main bearing caps in Cirrus-Hermes engines manu-
factured prior to August, 1930, were made in aluminium alloy
to Specification L. 5, and it fias been found by experience that
these parts are liable to develop cracks which ultimately
result in failure of the cap.
(2) A symptom of this defect is a falling off in the oil
pressure which becomes progressively worse as the cracks
develop. If, therefore, the oil pressure has dropped unduly,
it should be verified that there are no external leaks in the
oiling system, and the bottom half of the crankcase should
then be removed for inspection.
(3) Cracked bearing caps must be replaced by new ones,
and it is preferable that the crankcase should be returned
to the engine makers for this purpose. Alternatively, new
caps produced in accordance with Modification H.E.M.I, as
listed below, which have the holt holes slightly elongated to
allow for any differences in bolt centres, can, if necessary,
he obtained from the makers and fitted, in which case care
must be taken to ensure that the new cap is central in a
transverse direction before finally tightening the slotted
nuts. The modified caps are as follow :■ —
C. 190. A. Bearing Cap, front, rear, and centre 3 off per
engine.
C. 191, A. „ „ No. 2 and No. 4 .. 2 old per
engine.


(4) Bearing caps fitted to engines of later manufacture
are made from “ Y " alloy and are of a more robust con-
struction. This strengthened type of cap is used for all
replacements by the engine builders.
(24/5/1932)
26. Accidental Ignition of Holt Flares
(113153/31)
Owing to the possibility of the accidental ignition of Holt
flares fitted to aircraft, owners of aircraft and proprietors of
civil aerodromes are strongly advised to ensure that, before
an aircraft is placed in a hangar, both the leads to any Holt
flares fitted are disconnected.
(27/6/1932)
29. Examination of Applicants for Ground Engineers’ Licences,
or Extensions to the Scope of Existing Licences, in
Category X (Parachutes)
(182901/32)
(1) The examination of applicants for ground engineers’
licences in Category X, “ Inspection, maintenance, packing
and fitting of parachutes and equipment ”, will in future
be conducted at the Home Aircraft Depot, R.A.F., Henlow
Camp, Beds.
(2) Examination Boards will sit at the above centre for this
purpose twice a year, on the 3rd Friday in the months of
August and February, and examination in the parachute
category can only be made at these specific times.
(3) The holder of a licence in Category X for parachute
work will be required to produce satisfactory evidence that
he has been actively and continuously employed on parachute
work up to within 6 months of the date of expiry of his
licence, otherwise he will be required to submit himself for
re-examination if renewal of the licence is desired.
(4) Applications for licences should be made on the appro-
priate form, which is obtainable on request, and should be
addressed to The Secretary, Air Ministry (C.A.2), Adastral
House, Kingsway, London, W.C.2. Applications for exten-
sions to existing licences will also be dealt with at these
boards, and such applications should be sent by letter to the
address given above, giving particulars of recent experience
in respect of the extension required together with the appro-
priate fee.
(5) Applications for examination can only be accepted
provided that the application is received 28 days before the
date of examination and provided also that the total number
of applications received is within the capacity of the board.
(5/7/1932)
(25448) C


31. Care and Maintenance of Aircraft Tyres
(189247/32)
(1) Attention is drawn to the danger of aircraft tyres
developing “ concussion bursts ” resulting in complete failure
of the outer cover. In some instances the initial stage of
such bnrsfs takes the form of partial failure only of the inner
plies of the casing, and the resultant complete failure may be
delayed for a considerable period.
(2) It is therefore recommended that periodic examination
be made of undercarriage tyres for indications of the initial
stages of failure. The most satisfactory method of detection
is to pass the hand over the tyre, when the affected area
can generally be detected by a local swelling.
(3) Where local swellings are found, the cover should be
removed for examination of the inner plies. In the case of
large tyres it is recommended that covers should be removed
at intervals and examination made of the casing for the
purpose of detecting small casing fractures which may not be
indicated by the method of test described in (2) above.
(4) Tyre pressure gauges of various types are available for
checking tyre pressures. It is recommended that these be
used for ensuring that the air pressure specified by the tyre
maker is maintained. It is also recommended that these
tyre pressure gauges be checked for accuracy at frequent
intervals.
(7/7/1932)
32. Gipsy I, II and III Engines—Cylinder Heads:
Fracture of Valve Rocker Bracket Platforms
(189146/32)
(1) A few instances of cylinder head failure on the above
engines have occurred, owing to cracks developing in the
rocker bracket platform.
(2) Experience shows that these cracks usually start from
a point adjacent to the rocker bracket bolt hole at the rear
of the exhaust port, and travel through the bracket to the
exhaust valve guide hole and the side face of the bracket.
Special attention should be given to these points when
inspection is being made.
(3) Cylinder heads should be carefully inspected for signs of
cracks at regular intervals while the engine is in service, and
particularly during top overhauls. Any cylinder head which
shows this defect is to be rejected. Inspection of the cylinder
heads of Gipsy I engines, when installed, can be readily


effected with the aid of a small mirror and a suitable electric
hand lamp; on Gipsy II and 111 engines, the task is more
difficult, and it is recommended that a small round mirror
mounted on a rod, of the type used by dentists, be used, and
that lighting be effected by a small “ pea lamp ” connected by
flexible wires to the electric hand lamp, or by some other
suitable method of illumination. Scrupulous cleanliness of
all parts before inspection is necessary for the detection of
this type of defect in its early stages.
(4) Cylinder heads of recent production incorporate a
vertical stiffening rib, and the bolt boss adjacent to the
exhaust port which joins this rib has been increased in depth.
For Gipsy II heads this necessitates an additional rocker
bracket bolt, part 1302-61 A, in place of one of the shorter
bolts part 1302-368. In the case of rocker bracket bolls
for Gipsy I heads, the material for these has been altered
from specification S.l to specification 5.2, and one long bolt,
part 1302-61 A, and two short bolts, part 1302-368, complete
with nuts, part 1302-65, are therefore required when fitting
this latest design of cylinder head.
(14/7/1932)
33. Cirrus Mark III Engines: Rocker Brackets
(192995/32)
(1) When changing or grinding-in valves on the above
engines, there is no necessity to remove the rocker bracket
from the cylinder head, provided that the suction cup type
of valve grinding tool supplied by the engine constructors,
is used.
(2) If the rocker bracket is removed for any purpose, care
should be taken, when re-fitting the bracket to the cylinder
head, to ensure that; —
(«) the abutting faces are free from foreign matter.
(&) “ Amros ” spring washers are fitted under the nuts
used to secure the brackets,
(c) all nuts are evenly and adequately tightened with-
out undue stress; the spanner used should not
have more than 4 inches leverage.
(29/7/1932)
38. Separate Locking of Turn-buckles
(191687/32)
(1) In certain cases it is the practice to lock the turn-
buckles of twin adjacent control wires by a single length of
locking wire. Attention is drawn to the fact that vibration
and relative movement of the two turn-buckles may lead to
failure of the locking wire.
(25448) C 2


(2) Instances of the use of this single locking wire may
be found on the elevator controls of the various types of
D.H. " Moth ”, and D.H.9.J. aircraft, and the arrangement
may be in vogue on other types of aircraft.
(3) Ground engineers are, therefore, to examine the control
cable turn-buckles of all aircraft for which they are respon-
sible, and are to replace the single locking wire, where found,
by a separate length of wire for each turn-buckle, so that
each turn-buckle is securely and independently locked.
(4) The Certificate of Airworthiness of any aircraft
affected by the instruction referred to above will be liable
to suspension or cancellation if the instruction is not fulfilled
within one month from the date of this Notice. The Certi-
ficate of Airworthiness will not be renewed and ground
engineers must not sign daily certificates in respect of such
aircraft after the expiration of the afore-mentioned period
unless the alteration has been correctly completed.
(17/8/1932)
40. Aero Engine Speeds
(159862/32)
(]} Attention is drawn to the importance of keeping within
the limits of engine speed stated on the instruction plate
fixed in the cockpit of each aeroplane.
(2) Except in emergency the speed of the engine(s) must
not exceed the “ normal r.p.m.” for a total of more than five
minutes in each flight, or, if the flight exceeds one hour, in
each hour of the flight.
(3] Many of the stresses to which the airscrew and engine
are subjected increase rapidly with increase of r.p.m., and it
is the responsibility of the operator to ensure that the
“ maximum permissible r.p.m.” are never exceeded.
(26/8/1932)
41. Small Cabin Aircraft: need for caution during flight
under certain conditions
(201304/32)
(1} Pilots flying small cabin aircraft are warned of the
need for caution when flying in or near clouds, particularly
in rough or disturbed weather.
(2] Below and in certain types of clouds, air currents with
large vertical velocities exist. In some cases, the vertical
velocity over a small localised area amounts to 30 feet per


second, while during a thunderstorm, or even during the
later stages of its development, a vertical velocity of 50 feet
per second may be expected.
(3) These dangerous conditions are usually indicated by
one or more of the following signs :
(i) Unusually squally winds at ground level.
(ii) Wind direction between west and north.
(iii) Clouds of a cumulus type, often building up during
the day to very considerable heights.
(iv) Rapid decrease of temperature with height above
the ground.
(4) In such circumstances, high speeds should be avoided
and, as far as practicable, passengers and other movable
load should be secured.
(31/8/1932)
44. Timing of Gipsy II and III Engines
(201790/32)
(1) As a result of extended tests on Gipsy II and 111
engines, it has been decided that the advanced timing of the
magnetos should be decreased from 40° advance to 34° advance.
(2) The magnetos of engines of the above-mentioned types
are, therefore, to be re-timed by following the procedure
detailed below; —
(a) Remove the magnetos from the engine.
[b] The mark on the front cover for the present
advance of 40° will be found to be 44-5 millimetres before
the top dead centre when measured round the circum-
ference ; for the new advance position of 34°, this
dimension is reduced to 38 millimetres. A line should
be scribed at the latter point and the old mark filed out.
(c) Turn the engine until the timing pointer, which
will be found in the propeller boss, is opposite the newly
made mark.
[d] Set the cam ring on the magneto to the fully
advanced position, that is, in the extreme clockwise
position when looking at the distributor end of the
magneto, and rotate the armature until the contact
breaker points are just about to break.
(. e) Hold the magneto on its platform on the engine
in such a position that the rubber portion of the coupling
can be rotated freely between the two metal portions,


and then bring same round to a position where the teeth
on either side are opposite spaces in the corresponding
metal parts; when this position is found push the
magneto home and bolt up.
(Note. —During this operation great care must be
exercised to ensure that the position of the armature as
set under instruction [i) above is not altered.)
(/) Re-connect the ignition wires as originally arranged,
(3) On the completion of the alteration, the engine log
book, engine name plate and data plate in cockpit (if any)
should be corrected accordingly.
(4) The Certificates of Airworthiness of any aircraft affected
by the above modification will be liable to suspension or
cancellation if the modification has not been effected within
three months of the date of this Notice. Certificates of
Airworthiness will not be renewed and ground engineers
must not sign daily certificates in respect of such aircraft
after the expiration of the aforementioned period, unless the
modification has been correctly carried out.
(20/9/1932)
52. B.T.H. Type Impulse Starters on B.T.H. Type Magnetos
(186077/32)
(1) The B.T.H. Impulse Starters, Type L, have thinner
back plates than the earlier "A" types of Impulse Starters.
(2) When replacing Impulse Starters of the “ A ” type
by the " L ” type, it is important that the correct screws,
Part No. C.X.52175, | in. long overall, are used, as internal
fouling and damage may occur if the screws are too long.
(2/11/1932)
55. Rolls-Royce “Falcon III” Engines
(210399/32)
(1) Where not already effected, the undermentioned
modifications are to be incorporated in all Falcon 111
engines at the next complete overhaul; —
(а) Mod.jD. 1469. —Two A.V.12 type magnetos and
otherwise complete dual ignition to be fitted.
Note. —This modification applies only where engines
are fitted with two Watford type C. 6. Magnetos.
(б) Mod.jD. 1519. —The planet expanding bolt, in
the epicyclic gear to be replaced by a new bolt. Part
No. G. 6196, together with nut, washer and cones.


(■ c] Falcon Mod.j\\7. —The carburettor diffuser
depression tube to be positively locked by drifting
with a fluted drift, the guard tube to be soldered to
the diffuser base.
[d] Falcon Mod.j\\3. —The slow-running tubes of
the carburettor to be fitted with a collar to prevent
complete unscrewing.
(e) Falcon Mod. /111. —A modified base plug. Part
No. E. 11854/1, to be fitted to the diffuser base plugs
to prevent the diffuser jet unscrewing. Alternatively,
a disc of brass of suitable thickness may be sweated
to old type plugs.
(/) Falcon M0d.1 138. —New type ignition cable
clips for shortened L.T. connections, Part No.
E. 31296, to be fitted in lieu of clips to Part No.
E. 24999.
{g) Falcon Mod.j\32. —All sharp edges and tool
marks to be carefully removed from connecting rods.
(2) The following requirements are also to be observed : —■
{a) Falcon Mod.) 153. —Crankshafts to Part Nos.
E. 11729 and E. 14720 are known to be subject to
fracture from fatigue after 750 hours running.
Crankshafts of these Part Nos. are therefore to be
replaced immediately after completing 750 hours
running. Used crankshafts to the same Part Nos. as
those quoted above which have not completed 750
hours running and are in all other respects service-
able can, of course, be used as replacements. This
restriction of the running hours of crankshafts does
not apply to the latest type of shaft bearing the Part
No. E. 35490.
(b) Cylinder barrels that have not been nickel plated
on the outside surface in contact with the cooling
water, are prone to corrosion, and instances are known
where complete penetration of the barrels has occurred.
Where however, the barrels have been nickel plated,
corrosion is less likely to occur. Unplated barrels,
therefore, should be carefully examined at each con-
venient opportunity for the presence of such corrosion.
(3) Certificates of Airworthiness will not be issued or re-
newed in respect of aircraft affected, current Certificates of
Airworthiness will be liable to suspension or cancellation,
and ground engineers must not sign Daily Certificates in
respect of such aircraft unless the requirements detailed in
this Notice have been complied with.
(24/11/1932).

3. Gipsy I Engines: Ignition Timing and
Valve Tappet Clearances
(214181/32)
1. As a result of extended tests on Gipsy I engines, it has
been decided that the advanced timing of the magnetos should
be decreased from 38° advance to 34° advance.
2. The magnetos of Gipsy I engines are, therefore, to be
re-timed by following the procedure detailed below :
(«) Remove the magnetos from the engine.
[b) The mark on the rim of the front cover for the
present advance of 38° will be found to be 36-5 m/m
before top dead centre when measured round the circum-
ference ; with the new position of 34° advance this
dimension is reduced to 32'5 m/m. A line should be
scribed at the latter point and the old mark filed out.
Tor convenience, the position of this new line may be
determined by using dividers set at 31-75 m/m and the
line scribed with the dividers from the top dead centre
position.
[c] Turn the engine until the timing pointer, which
will be found on the propeller boss, is opposite the newly
made mark.
[i] Set the magnetos with the contact points about to
break with the cam ring in the fully advanced position.
[e) Hold the magneto on its platform on the engine in
such a position that the rubber portion of the coupling
may be rotated freely between the two metal portions.
The rubber coupling should then be rotated until the
position of the teeth on either side of this coupling are
opposite the spaces in the corresponding metal parts ;
when this position is found, push the magneto home, bolt
up and lock.
[Note. —During this operation great care must be
exercised to ensure that the position of the armature, as
set in accordance with instruction (d), is not altered).
(/) Re-connect the ignition wires as originally arranged.
3. On the completion of the alteration of the magneto
timing, the engine log hook, engine name plate, and data plate
in cockpit (if any) should be corrected accordingly.
4. In order to reduce the stresses on valves and valve seats,
the inlet and exhaust tappet clearances are to he set at • 005 in.

20. “Jupiter” Engines: Essential Modifications
(234940/33)
1. The essential modifications to engines of the above type
called for by Notices issued prior to Ist January, 1933, are
summarised below. Where not already effected these modifi-
cations should be incorporated immediately. The dates shown
below are the latest by which, under the terms of the previous
Notice, the Certificate of Airworthiness of aircraft fitted with
“ Jupiter ” engines would have been renewed without em-
bodiment of the modification in question.
(a) Magneto setting. —Jupiter Mod. No. 631 —Magneto
setting on all Jupiter engines except Series IV. —The previous
standard setting of 42° before top dead centre has been changed
to 35° in order to improve the smoothness of running and reduce
the liability to detonation, etc.
Previous Notice, No. 10 of 1930. (24/4/1930)
( b ) Crankshaft balancing plugs. —Crankshaft balancing plugs
should be examined to ensure that these parts are correctly
locked.


The correct method of locking is to peen the metal from
the balance weight into the slot in the head of the plug by-
means of a suitable blunt chisel ox punch.
Any plug found unlocked should be first checked for tight-
ness by means of a screwdriver.
Plugs already locked should also be checked and if any
slackness is found must be tightened up and relocked.
Engines supplied by the constructor subsequent to
February, 1931, have already been modified in this respect.
Previous Notice, No. 21 of 1931. (27/2/1931)
(A Master connecting rods. —Jupiter Mod. No. 761. —Certain
master connecting rods are fitted with a hardened steel sleeve,
shrunk into the big end, which is located by means of a tongue
on the rod entering a slot in the sleeve. On master rods bearing
the following Part Nos. :
F 8.13025,
F8.13025/1,
F8.13025/2,
F8.13025/3,
F8.13025/4,
FB .23771,
there is a sharp corner where the tongue joins the body of the
rod, and failures have occurred owing to cracks starting at this
point.
Rods hearing any of the above markings are to be replaced
by modified rods with increased radius of 0-040 in.
These rods can be modified by the makers, and all parts so
modified will bear the marking “ RAD ” as a suffix to the
Part No. except in the case of Rod F 8.23771 which will be
re-marked F8.23771/2.
Previous Notice, No. 9 of 1932. (6/4/1932)
(d) Diffuser assemblies. —Extreme care is necessary when
refitting diffuser assemblies to carburettor bodies in order that
the diffuser tube may not be strained and distorted, conse-
quently preventing the proper lunctioning of the fluted valve.
The joint between the diffuser assembly and the body of the
carburettor is made at the shoulder 0-810 in. below the under-
side of the hexagon head formed on Part No. FB. 16172, per-
mitting clearance between the hexagon head and the boss into
which the assembly fits. The assembly is locked into position
by the nut FB .5254/1.


It is essential, therefore, when screwing diffusers into the
carburettor body, that the correct spanner, viz. Part No.
F 8.20289,.20289, be used on the brass hexagon diffuser head.
Furthermore, in no case may the spanner be overloaded by the
use of tubes or any other means of obtaining greater leverage
than that normally provided by the length of spanner.

(e) Oilpumps.—Jupiter Mod. No. 954, Jupiter Mod. No. 961,
Jupiter Mod. No. 917, Jupiter Mod. No. 717 — Oil pumps for
Series VI, VII, VIII, IX, XI, VIIF, VIIIF, IXF, XIF,
VIIFP, VIIIFP, IXFP, XIFP and XFBM engines.—
—Owing to failures of the original type of dural gears fitted to
these oil pumps, a modified form of gear made in aluminium-
bronze and with teeth “ backed off ” to prevent oil trapping,
has been introduced.
When assembling the new gears, care must be taken to see
that the Mk.X which is stamped on one end of each gear, faces
the centre shim of the oil pump in accordance with the In-
struction plate which is supplied for attachment to the pump,
when the change of gears is carried out.
This modification applies to both pressure and scavenger
gears.
In the case of installations in which the level of the oil in
the tank may be above that of the point where the oil supply
pipe enters the engine when the aircraft is in its normal
position on the ground, it will be necessary to fit a check valve
in addition to the new gears in order to prevent oil draining
into the engine through the backed off spaces in the gear teeth
when the machine is standing idle.
Instructions for the embodiment of these modifications,
together with drawings and the necessary parts, may be
obtained on application to the Bristol Aeroplane Co., Ltd.,
Filton House, Bristol.
Previous Notice, No. 19 of 1932. (12/8/1932)

21. Altimeters carried in Enclosed Compartments
(153575/31)
3. Experience has shown that variations from the true
static pressure inside enclosed cockpits and cabins may be
sufficient to cause considerable errors in the readings of
altimeters carried therein. Sudden changes in the readings
of altimeters when an adj acent window is opened will indicate
this effect.
2. The difficulty may be overcome by fitting to the alti-
meter an airtight case with a connection by which it can be
coupled, by means of a “ T ” joint, to the static side of the
airspeed indicator installation.
3. A design of modified case for the Mk. V altimeter is
shown on Air Ministry drawing No. Sk. H. 13167/1-6, copies
of which may be obtained on application to the Secretary
(R.T.P.), Air Ministry, Adastral House, London, W.C.2. The
dimensioned parts on this drawing are intended for the
“ Zenith ” type case and the dimensions may require modi-
fication to suit other types of case.
4. The altimeter case and the connection to the static side
of the A.S.I. must be sufficiently free from leaks to ensure
that no serious error is introduced thereby into the A.S.I.
reading. After connecting the altimeter case to the static
side of the A.S.I. system, the usual A.S.I. installation leak
tests should be made by first applying pressure to the pressure
tube of the pitot head, and secondly, by applying suction to
the static tube. Under these conditions, there must be no
leak on the pressure side, and the leak, if any, on the static
side must not exceed that indicated by a fall of the pointer
from 80 m.p.h. to 40 m.p.h. in 4 seconds.

29. D.H. “Gipsy” Engine Connecting Rods
(244691/33)
1. It has been found by experience that certain Y alloy
connecting rods with embossed lettering and Part Number
on the shank, fitted to early Gipsy I, II and 111 engines,
have small surface cracks, the origin of which has been traced
to the stamping process. These cracks, if discovered in the
early stages, can be satisfactorily removed by the method
subsequently described, but if allowed to remain they are
liable to develop and ultimately result in failure of the rods.
2. This form of defect has been eliminated in rods of
recent manufacture by changing the material from Y alloy
to D.T.D.130, omitting the embossed lettering, improving
the stamping process, machining and/or polishing the whole


surface. Consequently, those rods which have no embossed
lettering on the shank and stamped D.T.D. 130 may he regarded
as satisfactory and not subject to the conditions of this
Notice.
3. During the next top overhaul of engines, any con-
necting rods of the type referred to in Paragraph 1 are to be
removed and treated as follows :
(i) The embossed letters and figures should be carefully
removed with a file.
(ii) If a buffing machine is available, all traces of file
marks should be removed on the buff and a high polish
obtained. During this operation careful attention should
be paid to the elimination of the small cracks which, if
present, will he found round the letters, hut the minimum
amount of metal is to he removed.
4. Having satisfied the requirements of Paragraph 3,
special attention is to be paid to the opposite side of the rod,
where, in all probability, it will be found that, owing to the
reversing operation of the rod during stamping, the cracks
may penetrate slightly deeper than they did on the side with
the embossed lettering. During the buffing operation on this
side, careful inspection should he maintained to determine
the progress which is being made. The buffing operation
should be stopped—
[a] as soon as the cracks have been removed, or
lb) as soon as the minimum thickness of the web has
been reached.
5. In the case of Gipsy I connecting rods, the minimum
thickness allowed is 4'smm. (-0-25 mm. or O-01 in.),
and for Gipsy II and 111 rods 6-5 mm. (—O-25 mm. or
O-01 in.). Any connecting rods which still show the
slightest sign of a crack when these dimensions have been
reached should be rejected.
6. Where a buffing machine is not available, the lettering
and figures should be removed as in Paragraph 3 (i), and all
file marks removed with a flat or half-round scraper, care
being taken to keep the surface of the rod flat. The rods
should then be polished with smooth emery cloth until the
surface is perfectly clean and free from scratches or scraper
marks. The emery cloth used should not be coarser than
00 grade.
7. When dealing with the opposite side of the rod, the
same observations as quoted in Paragraphs 4 and 5 are
required, but in lieu of huffing, cracks should be removed
by careful filing, scraping and polishing.


8. Having completed the above operations, attention
should be paid to other parts of the rod in which defects have
been found to occur, as follows :
[a] Along the edges of the " H ” section, particularly
where the section joins the gudgeon pin and big end
bosses.
(. b ) Around the oil holes running from the bottom of
the “ H ” section into the gudgeon pin bore.
(c) Where the top face of the bolt boss joins the rod
section (i.e., adjacent to the face engaging the connecting
rod bolt nut).
9. The rod should be carefully polished at all the points
referred to in Paragraph 8 (a), ( b ) and (c), under the procedure
already outlined, particular attention being given to the
removal of machine marks or longitudinal scratches when
dealing with (c).
10. When all the above conditions have been met, the rod
is in a fit state for etching. This should be carried out by
the following procedure :
Hydrofluoric etching. —Two baths are required for this
process :
(i) A bath consisting of hydrofluoric and sulphuric
acid in the following proportions :
Hydrofluoric Acid .. . . 1 part.
10 per cent. Sulphuric Acid .. .. 5 parts.
It is essential that this solution be kept in a lead bath
and used cold.
(ii) A bath of 50 per cent, nitric acid in water (cold).
In preparing this bath add nitric acid to water —not
vice versa.
The rod should be completely immersed in Bath (i) for
a period of one minute (it is imperative that this time is not
exceeded), and then transferred quickly to Bath (ii) and
wiped over whilst in the bath with a small mop or wad of
cotton wool, held in a pair of tweezers, until clean, after
which it is to be thoroughly washed in running water to
remove all traces of acid. This is to be followed by immersion
in boiling water for five minutes. When the rod is dry a
thorough examination of all surfaces of the rod should be
made through a suitable magnifying lens. A small mirror
should be used to assist inspection of the small end bore.
Any rods found to be cracked must be rejected.
11. Rods which have had the lettering removed and which
are found to be free from cracks are to have the Part Number
lightly stamped or engraved along the outside of one of the


"big end bolt bosses. In carrying out this operation great
care must be taken, as heavy stamping oi the rod may possibly
lead to iatigue cracking or distortion of the bolt hole. A
suitable record should be made in the Engine Log Book when
the work detailed in Paragraphs 3 to 10 inclusive has been
satisfactorily carried out.
12. Rods that have been treated in accordance with this
Notice or the Notice referred to in Paragraph 16 are, in
addition, to be polished, etched and examined in the manner
described herein at each complete overhaul, notwithstanding
the fact that they were rectified at the top overhaul preceding
the complete overhaul.
13. It is pointed out that the Gipsy I connecting rod is
not interchangeable with the Gipsy II and 111 rods from a
strength point of view, although the dimensions are such that
it is possible to fit a Gipsy I rod into the Gipsy II and 111
engines. The Part Number of the Gipsy I rod is 800-10 and
of the Gipsy II and 111 rods 1300-15.
14. A number of Gipsy I connecting rods, Part Number
800-10, have the two oil holes in the underside of the gudgeon
pin boss drilled close together so that they merge into one
hole where they enter the gudgeon pin bore. Rods so drilled
are very prone to cracking, and their maximum safe life has
consequently been fixed at 600 hours. Rods which have
completed 600 hours’ running are to be removed from engines
and replaced by others of later manufacture, as listed below,
and where no evidence of the number of hours running can
be produced, they are to be renewed within two years of
the time the engine was first put into service.
(i) Rods in which the holes are approximately 11 mm.
apart where they enter the gudgeon pin bore.
(ii) Rods having the holes omitted entirely.
15. Certificates of airworthiness of any aircraft fitted with
engines of the types referred to in this Notice shall be liable to
suspension or cancellation if the requirements herein have
not been complied with, and ground engineers must not sign
daily certificates in respect of such aircraft unless the instruc-
tions have been satisfactorily carried out.

33. Light Alloy Airscrews:
Removal of Scratches and Sharp Nicks
(260649/33)
1. Deep scratches or sharp-cornered indentations, caused
by foreign matter being drawn into the blades of an airscrew
during ground running, reduce the ability of the metal to
withstand fluctuating stresses, and may promote fatigue
fracture.
2. Both faces, the leading and trailing edges of the blades
of light alloy airscrews are, therefore, to be examined at
frequent intervals, and defects of this nature removed by a
file or coarse emery cloth. In smoothing out defects, the
amount of metal removed is not to be more than is necessary
to convert sharp nicks into smooth rounded depressions
blending into the surrounding surface. Finally, the resulting
surfaces are to be polished with fine emery cloth to eliminate
all marks left by the file or coarse emery cloth.
3. Airscrews on which the scars are too numerous or are
of such a depth that their removal would seriously reduce
the cross sectional area of the blades, are to be withdrawn
from use.
4. If vibration is experienced with an airscrew from which
defects have been removed, the airscrew is to be checked for
balance, which is to be corrected if necessary.

35. Pobjoy “R” Type Engine: Air Intake
(250869/33)
1. For operation in cold weather, the standard air intake,
Part No. R. 529, has been found inadequate to prevent freezing
of the carburettor unless provided with a scoop drawing warm
air from the neighbourhood of the cylinder.
2. For uncowled or partially cowled installations, an air
scoop, Part No. R. 539, can be obtained from Messrs. Pobjoy
Airmotors Ltd., and must be fitted before 31st October, 1933.
This scoop is provided with an adjustable shutter to admit
cold air as required.


3. Certificates of Airworthiness of any aircraft affected
by the above modification will be liable to suspension or

37. B.T.H. Magnetos, Types GL.5 and SG.7: Modification of
(261524/33)
1. Cases have occurred where the earth contact in the
moulded contact breaker cover has not been in contact with
the contact breaker fixing screw, due to the binding of the
spiral spring in its socket. This breaks the continuity of the
earth circuit, making it impossible to switch the magneto off.
2. In order to eliminate the above-mentioned risk, a
modified type of earth contact has been designed, and is
covered by Civil Modification B.T.H. No. X-l.
3. This modification is to be incorporated at the earliest
opportunity.
4. The British Thomson Houston Co., Alma Street,
Coventry, will, on application, supply all owners free of charge
with the necessary parts to effect this modification.
5. The Certificate of Airworthiness of any aircraft affected
by the above modification will be liable to suspension or
cancellation if the modification has not been effected within
three months of the date of this notice. Certificates of
Airworthiness will not be renewed and ground engineers must

40. Aircraft fitted with Wheel Brakes operated by means of
Air Pressure
(165179/32)
1. A case has occurred of failure of the rubber-canvas air
reservoir for a pneumatically operated wheel brake system. To
safeguard against the possibility;' of similar trouble, or at least
to restrict damage occurring in the event of a cylinder bursting,
one of the following alternative courses is to be adopted :
(a) To fit a protective wrapper round the reservoir ;
(b) To replace the rubber-canvas reservoir by a Palmer
metal braided rubber-canvas reservoir ;
(c) To fit a Mk. II Steel Cylinder in place of the rubber-
canvas reservoir.


2. An approved protective wrapper may be made up as
follows ;
A tube should be made up from 22 gauge Duralumin to
Specification L. 3., or mild steel to Specification 5.3, of
such a diameter as to be a sliding fit over the reservoir
when the latter is inflated to 100 lb. per sq. in. pressure.
The longitudinal joint should be of lap type with two
rows of | in. diameter rivets at | in. pitch, the two rows
being | in. distant from one another with the rivets
staggered. The rows of rivets should be not less than
| in. from the raw edges of the plate. All rivets should be
countersunk on the inside of the tube in contact with the
reservoir.
The tube ends should be serrated to a depth of 1J in.
with a pitch of | in. and radiused | in. top and bottom.
After fitting the cylinder over the reservoir the teeth of
the serrations should be bent over to locate the reservoir
lengthways, the serrations engaging against the metal end
plates of the reservoir.
3. The above modification must be incorporated in all air-
craft that are affected within six months of the date of this
Notice in order that the Certificate of Airworthiness of the
aircraft shall remain valid. Certificates of Airworthiness will
not be renewed and ground engineers must not sign Daily
Certificates for such aircraft after the expiration of the afore-
mentioned period unless the modification has been correctly
embodied.
(26/8/1933)
41. D.H. 84 “Dragon” Aeroplane: Rigging of Tail Plane
(60361/30)
1. Special care is necessary when carrying out rigging
adjustments to the tail plane of the D.H. 84 “ Dragon ”
aeroplane.
2. In order to ensure that the tail plane bracing wires will
be adequately tensioned for the whole range of the tail plane
incidence, the procedure detailed below is to be followed.
3. The tail plane is to be set in the neutral position as
determined from the indicator adjacent to the tail plane
adjuster wheel and all external bracing wires adjusted to the
normal tension. The bottom rear bracing wires are then to be
given an extra half turn.
4. Care must be taken to ensure that the wiring plates on

42. Wooden Airscrews for Gipsy II & III and Gipsy Major
Engines
(265154/33)
1. Instances have occurred of splitting of the above air-
screws in the region of the boss due to the transmission of
part of the airscrew torque by the hub bolts instead of entirely
by friction at the rear boss face.
2. Wooden airscrews which are or have been in use on these
engines are immediately to be removed from the hubs and
examined for signs of fracture of the boss, particularly at the
rear face in the region of the bolt holes.
3. Any such airscrews showing signs of fracture are to be
regarded as unserviceable.
4. When assembling serviceable airscrews and hubs, care
must be taken to ensure that the hub bolt nuts are adequately
tightened before being locked. In order to maintain the friction
drive, the tightness of these nuts is to be checked periodically
and any slackness found is to he taken up. With airscrew's in
frequent use, this periodical check should be made at the end
of every 25 hours flying, while, in the case of new airscrews, the
tightness of the nuts should be verified during the first 10
hours flying.

attachments. These deeper section tubes are 1- 4 in. deep and
may be identified by direct measurement. If no defects are
found, the examination should be repeated at intervals, more
particularly after the aeroplane has suffered severe loads in
landing or taxying. If any defect is found, no further flying
is to be carried out until all defects have been repaired and
additional cabin roof bracing to drawing No. M. 1963, obtain-
able from The de Havilland Aircraft Company Limited, has
been fitted.
3. The additional roof bracing shown in drawing No.
M. 1963 must, in any event, be embodied within four months
from the date of this notice. After the expiration of this
period, Certificates of Airworthiness of aeroplanes affected
will be liable to suspension or cancellation and will not be
renewed, and ground engineers must not sign Daily Certificates
in respect of such aeroplanes, unless the modification has
been satisfactorily embodied.
4. After the introduction of the bracing to drawing No.
M. 1963, the curved Vee bracing tubes must be maintained in
a state of sound repair and any defects therein remedied
immediately, to enable them to act as formers for the cabin
roof.

51. D.H. 60.X.G. and M. (“Moth”) Aeroplanes: Top Centre
Section Spars—Eyebolts
(286546/33)
1. Cases have occurred in which severe corrosion has
developed on the stems of the eyebolts securing the petrol
tank and centre section struts to the centre section spars on
aeroplanes of the above types. The bolts referred to are four
in number, and are located in holes near the ends of the centre
section front and rear spars, the flange of each bolt being
sweated to the spar.
2. In order to remove these bolts for examination, the
following dismantling procedure is to be carried out :
(i) Remove the port and starboard main planes com-
plete.
(ii) Remove the petrol tank.
(iii) Slack off centre section bracing wires.
(iv) Remove centre section wood fairing.
The flange of each bolt is then to be unsweated, care being
taken to confine the applied heat to the bolt flange. The top
end of the bolt should be tapped to assist loosening. On re-
assembly, it is not essential to resweat the bolts in position, as
the sweating provides for location only.
3. These bolts are to be carefully examined when aeroplanes
of the above types are submitted for renewal of their Certifi-
cates of Airworthiness, and any corroded bolts must be re-
placed by new ones,
(20/11/1933)


52. D.H. 83 “Fox Moth” Aeroplanes: Pilot’s Seat
(285109/33)
1. Cases have occurred on " Fox Moth ” aeroplanes in
which the elevator control lever in the forward part of the rear
fuselage has penetrated the dome shaped shield on the back of
the pilot’s seat. This defect is caused by distortion of the seat
back by hard usage, which has the effect of pushing back the
shield on to the lever. When the seat is in sound condition
and the controls are correctly rigged, the top of the elevator
control lever should be clear of the shield when the control
column is fully forward and the top of the control column is in
contact with the back face of the luggage locker.
2. The pilot’s seats of “ Fox Moth ” aeroplanes are to be
examined immediately to ascertain whether the defects de-
scribed in Paragraph 1 are present, and if any defects are
found, suitable repairs and adjustments are to be made before
further flying is carried out. In no circumstances may the
shield over the clearance hole in the back of the seat be left off
during flight. If found damaged, this shield must be repaired
or replaced before further flight.
3. The following modifications shown in Messrs, de Havil-
land’s drawing M. 2431, must be incorporated in all “ Fox
Moth ’’ aeroplanes as soon as possible :
(a) Addition of vertical stiffeners to the seat back ;
(b) Fitting of spruce runner along the top of the seat
back;
(c) Fitting of thicker type of shield for seat back.
4. Certificates of Airworthiness of aeroplanes affected will
be liable to suspension or cancellation, and ground engineers
must not sign daily certificates in respect of such aeroplanes,
nor will Certificates of Airworthiness be renewed, after the
expiration of three months from the date of this Notice, unless
the modifications specified in Paragraph 3 above have been
satisfactorily embodied.
(1/12/1933)
53. Pobjoy “R” Type Engine: Magneto Coupling
(287054/33)
1. A magneto coupling R/080 which gives a positive drive,
has been developed to supersede the existing friction type
drive. The new coupling possesses the same shock absorbing
qualities and eliminates the risk of slipping.
(25448) D 2


2. The new type coupling should be fitted to both magnetos
at, or before, the next top overhaul of the engine. Messrs.
Pobjoy Aiimotors, Ltd., Hooton, Cheshire, will, on appli-
cation, supply the parts necessary to effect the change, together
■with Instructions for fitting, which must be carried out by a
suitably qualified ground engineer.
3. Certificates of Airworthiness of aircraft affected will be
liable to suspension or cancellation if the modification is not
satisfactorily incorporated within two months from the date of
this Notice. Certificates of Airworthiness will not be renewed
and ground engineers must not sign Daily Certificates in respect
of such aircraft after the expiration of this period, unless the
modification has been correctly embodied.
(12/12/1933)
55. Undercarriage Compression Rubbers
(256563/33)
1. Rubber blocks used in undercarriage compression legs
of aircraft are liable to deteriorate in service.
2. In order to ensure that the deterioration has not
occurred to such an extent as to render the leg ineffective,
the following procedure is to he adopted :
(<i) The aircraft is to be jacked up until the landing
wheels are off the ground and the free movement or
play of each unloaded leg is to be measured.
(i) Replacement of rubbers is to be made where free
movement or play exceeds the limit given in the hand-
book for the aircraft. In instances where the requisite
information is not given in the aircraft handbook,
application should be made to the constructors.
3. Before signing daily certificates for aircraft, ground
engineers must ensure that the condition of the undercarriage
meets the above requirements.
(18/12/1933)
56. Prevention of Fire due to Generation of Frictional
Electricity during Refuelling of Aircraft
(265645/33)
1. Attention is drawn to the possibility of fire occurring
as the result of the generation of frictional electricity during
the refuelling of an aircraft; serious fires have arisen from
this cause. Petrol is a poor conductor and frictional contact
■with another insulator will induce in the petrol a static charge
of electricity : a rubber filler pipe or a chamois leather filter
are particularly effective in this respect. Differences in


electrical potential may arise between filling nozzle, funnel
and tank of an amount dependent on the quantity of the
petrol delivered, the speed of delivery, and the dryness of the
atmosphere at the time, and under favourable conditions a
spark of sufficient intensity to ignite inflammable vapour may
be produced.
2. Differences in potential can be prevented by earthing
and providing metallic connection between all metal parts
with which the petrol comes into contact during the operation
of filling.

1. Wooden Airscrews Designed by the de Havilland Aircraft
Co., Ltd.
(292799/33)
1. Wooden airscrews designed by the de Havilland
Aircraft Company for all types of “ Gipsy ” engines during the
past four years, have four \ in. diameter holes drilled through
the airscrew boss for the insertion of metal balance weights.
In some cases these holes have been sealed with wax and in
others with wooden plugs.
2. As cases have occurred where the wax has melted and
reduced the friction between the rear face of the airscrew boss
and the rear flange of the airscrew hub, action is to be taken
to replace wax by shellac, as the sealing material for these
balance weight holes.
3. The following is the sequence of operations :
(a) Remove the wax from any one of the balance holes,
using a \ in. diameter drill if necessary, and carefully
take out the metal balance weight, if fitted.
(i b) Melt some shellac in a suitable receptacle and after
replacing the balance weight in the middle of the hole,
seal by pouring the liquid shellac into each end of the
hole in turn.
(c) Carry out a similar operation on each of the four
balance weight holes, whether balance weights are fitted
or not, especial care being taken to replace balance
weights in the appropriate holes.
Note. —Ordinary quality commercial shellac can be
used.
4. No action is necessary in respect of holes already plugged
with wood.
(25448) D 3


5, The above modification must be embodied in all air-
screws for “ Gipsy ” engines which are affected, within three
months from the date of this notice. After the expiration of
this period. Certificates of Airworthiness of aeroplanes fitted
with such airscrews will be Liable to suspension or cancellation
and wall not be renewed, and ground engineers must not sign
daily certificates in respect of such aeroplanes, unless the
modification has been satisfactorily embodied.

4. Airscrew Hubs for "Gipsy Major” Engines
(265154/33)
1. An improved design of airscrew hub to G.A. drawing
No. 1900 has been introduced for use on “Gipsy Major”
engines, and hubs of this design will be fitted to new “ Gipsy
Major ” engines, commencing with engine number 5438.
2. The new design differs mainly from the earlier design
which is the standard for “ Gipsy ” I, If and 111 engines, in that
the rear flange is appreciably greater in diameter. Other
changes have also been incorporated, including a small
increase in the diameter of the front flange.
3. It is found that, in general, a ridge is formed on the
boss faces of wooden airscrew's, irrespective of the engine on
which they have been used, as a result of the timber being
indented by the hub flanges. Wooden airscrews, therefore,
which have been used on “Gipsy Major” hubs of earlier
design and which are required to be fitted to hubs of improved
design, are to be examined for signs of indentation of the boss
faces. If such indentations are found, the boss faces are to be
trued up, preferably by an airscrew manufacturer. The
finished surfaces should be flat and smooth and a witness of
the original hub flange marking must be left on each face to
ensure that it is perpendicular to the axis of the bore. Care
should be taken that only the minimum amount of timber is
removed. Finally, the trued-up surfaces are to be revarnished.

considered to have reached the stage of obsolescence and,
bearing in mind the average flying time they are likely to have
experienced, there is a possibility of fatigue cracks developing
in the blade sheet in the region of the bolt holes. Immediate
steps should therefore be taken to withdraw these particular
airscrews from service, and owners are advised to communicate

10. D.H.82 & 82A "Tiger Moth” Aeroplanes: Inspection
and Modification of Bear Fuselage
(60361/30)
(304759/34)
1. It has been found that defects are liable to occur in the
rear end of the fuselage of aircraft of the above types. These
defects appear as cracks in the longerons at or near the ends
of the transverse gusset plates between the left and right
hand longerons just in front of the sternpost, and are due to
racking loads from the tail skid.
2. Accordingly, the bottom longerons in the skid bay are
to be immediately inspected for signs of cracks. If any such
defects are found the aircraft is not to be flown until an
approved repair has been made.


3. The following repair has been approved. Both adjacent
longerons are to be cut out of the bay and new lengths of
longeron welded in and a modified gusset plate H. 37982 is to
be welded in place as shown on drawing No. M. 1911, issue 2,
Part A, issued by The de Havilland Aircraft Co., Ltd.,
Hatfield Aerodrome, Herts.
4. If no cracks are detected, further inspections should be
made at frequent intervals.
5. All aircraft of the above types that have not been
repaired as above must be modified in accordance with
Drawing No. M. 1911, issue 2, Part B (issued by The de
Havilland Aircraft Co., Ltd.). The Certificates of Airworthi-
ness of aircraft affected will be liable to suspension or can-
cellation, ground engineers must not sign daily certificates in
respect of such aircraft, and Certificates of Airworthiness of
such aircraft will not be renewed, unless this modification has
been embodied.

13. B.T.H. Magnetos Type MI-1 for Pobjoy “R”
Engines
(317380/34)
1. It has been found that wear develops in the armature
and contact breaker rocker arm bearings of the above type
magneto, due primarily to electrical discharge through the
bearings.
2. To remedy these defects. Civil Modification No.
B.T.H. X.ll has been introduced. Magnetos which embody
the modification are stamped with the letter “ V ” on the
right-hand side of the housing, looking at the contact breaker
end. It is recommended that all other magnetos should be
returned to The British Thomson Houston Co., Ltd., Alma
Street, Coventry, for modification as soon as possible.
3. The Certificate of Airworthiness of any aircraft affected
will be liable to suspension or cancellation if this modification
has not been embodied within 3 months from the date of this
Notice. Certificates of Airworthiness will not be renewed and
ground engineers must not sign daily certificates in respect
of such aircraft after the expiration of this period unless the
modification has been correctly carried out.
(30/4/1934)


14. Pobjoy “R” Type Engine: Valve Rocker
Adjusting Screw
(287616/33)
1. Owing to rapid wear of the old pattern valve rocker
adjusting screw, Part No. 822, on the above engines, there is
a danger of the valve clearance increasing sufficiently during
flight to allow the rocker to foul the valve spring cap. New
type screws, Part No. 822/1, which are harder and have the
striking pad thickened np, must, therefore, be fitted not later
than the next top overhaul.
2. The minimum allowable clearance between rocker and
spring cap with valve dosed and clearance adjusted, is in.,
and in no circumstances may the rocker be filed to obtain
this. Since the clearance is affected by the push rod length
or by a badly fitting split cotter, it is important to ensure
that the push rods, which are marked with the number of
their respective cylinders just below the ball end, are in their
correct position, and that the split cotters are approximately
flush with the lower edge of the spring cap.
Note. —The inlet and exhaust push rods for a particular
cylinder hear the same number, but the exhaust rod is the
longer of the two.
3. Attention is also drawn to the method of assembling the
two collars positioning the inner valve spring ; it is imperative
that the projecting lip of the collar faces towards the rocker
in both cases.
4. Certificates of Airworthiness of any aircraft fitted with
engines of the type referred to in this Notice shall be liable
to suspension or cancellation if the requirements herein have
not been complied with. Certificates of Airworthiness will not
he renewed, and ground engineers must not sign daily
certificates in respect of such aircraft unless the instructions
have been satisfactorily carried out.
(8/5/1934)
16. Precautions Against Fire in Aircraft During
Radio Transmission
(316105/34)
1. There is a risk of fire occurring on aircraft fitted for
radio transmission because of the possibility of a breakdown
of insulation between the drum of the aerial winch and the
aerial winch frame when a trailing aerial is in use,


2. Ground Engineers must ensure that the aerial winch
frame is electrically bonded to the main earth system of the
aeroplane in a satisfactory manner. No daily certificates
may be signed in respect of aircraft on which this bonding
has not been carried out or is not satisfactory.
(9/5/1934)
17. Aircraft Tyre Pressures
(316937/34)
1. The attention of all concerned is drawn to the possibility
of damage occurring to aircraft and/or tyres fitted thereto as
a result of the tyres not having been maintained at the
correct pressure.
2. In many cases the tyres provide a large proportion of
the shock-absorbing capacity of the under-carriage, and in
such cases there is considerable danger of damage to the
aircraft structure owing to loss of shock-absorbing capacity of
the tyre if in an over-inflated state.
3. On the other hand, insufficient pressure may allow of
excessive flexing of the cover and consequent breakdown of
the walls, or damage to the tyre as a result of pinching, or to
the wheel as a result of impact with the ground.
4. In order that ground engineers may ensure that correct
pressures are employed, a schedule is attached as an appendix
hereto giving approved types of tyres for undercarriage and
tail wheels, and the correct air pressure for varying all-up
weights of aircraft. These pressures should be maintained as
accurately as possible ; there should not be a variation of
more than plus or minus 10 per cent.
5. It is pointed out that pressure gauges which are fitted
to or form part of the tyre pump cannot give accurate readings
of the pressure of air in the tyre, since the pump has to
overcome the resistance of the tyre valve. Pressures should
therefore be checked by the application of a gauge to the
tyre valve.

19. D.H.60G “Moth,” “Moth Major” and D.H.82A “Tiger
Moth” Aeroplanes with Gipsy III and Gipsy Major
Engines: Exhaust Extension Pipes.
(335992/34)
1. Cases have occurred on aeroplanes of the above types
of fatigue cracks developing in the exhaust extension pipe.
Part No. 39978 Mk. 1 and Mk. 2, at the point where the pipe
is supported by a clip, due to the length of the overhung
portion. These pipes can be readily identified by the length
of the overhang which is 24 in., and by perforations in the
form of round holes at the aft extremity.
2. Two other types of exhaust extension pipe are fitted to
certain aeroplanes concerned, but are not affected by this
Notice. They may be identified by the exhaust outlet being
in the form of two long slots extending the whole length of
the overhung portion in the one type, and in the other by the
pipe being made of stainless steel and having an overhang
of 17 in.
3. Pipes answering to the description given in para. 1
above are to be removed immediately and carefully examined
around the portion underneath the supporting clip for any
sign of fatigue cracks. If the pipe is found to be in good
condition, it may continue in use after being shortened by
cutting off the rear end to give an overhang not exceeding
17 in. Should any sign of fatigue cracks be discovered the
pipe must be rejected.
4. Pipes rejected under para. 3 must be replaced by pipes
of the same design shortened as described, or by pipes to one
of the designs given in para. 2.
5. The Certificates of Airworthiness of aeroplanes affected
will be liable to suspension or cancellation if this modification
has not been carried out within three months from the date of
this Notice. Certificates of Airworthiness will not be renewed
and Ground Engineers must not sign Daily Certificates in
respect of such aeroplanes after the expiration of this period
unless the modification has been carried out correctly.
(22/6/1934)
21. Aircraft fitted with Radio Transmitting Apparatus:
Bonding Requirements
(162790/32)
1. Considerable risk of fire may arise if radio transmitting
apparatus is operated in an aircraft unless each of the separate
components and the complete aircraft have been adequately
bonded.


Item No.
Description.
Date of
Application.
220
Engine ignition apparatus and acces-
saries—design requirements.

2. Where radio apparatus is installed in aircraft, ground
engineers should verify that the aircraft has been correctly
bonded and that the bonding is maintained.
3, When new or replacement components are fitted to an
aircraft in which transmitting radio apparatus is installed,
ground engineers should ensure that the individual components
have been bonded and that such components are bonded to
the aircraft. Under para. 4of Design Leaflet E. 5 of A.P.1208,
all aircraft carrying radio transmitting apparatus are required
to be bonded in accordance with Air Ministry General Equip-
ment Specification No. D.T.D. G.E.125 (latest issue) Part II
or other approved specification. Copies of Air Ministry
Specification No. D.T.D. G.E.125 may be obtained from
His Majesty’s Stationery Office, price Is. o d. net, or Is. 1 \d.
post free.
(14/7/1934)
28. Airscrew Designs approved for Civil Aircraft
Substance incorporated in other Notices
(30/7/1934)
23. Airworthiness Handbook for Civil Aircraft: Issue of
Amendment List No. 39
(319204/3 4)
1. Amendment List No. 39 of the Airworthiness Handbook
for Civil Aircraft (Air Publication 1208) has been issued, and
copies can be obtained from His Majesty’s Stationery Office,
Adastral House, Kingsway, W.C.2, or through any bookseller,
price Is. o d. net or Is, 2d. post free.
2. Attention is particularly directed to the following
amendments introduced by this amendment list. These
modified requirements will be applicable to new type aero-
planes or engines for which application is received after the
dates shown in the table below.


3. Item (223) introduces a new issue of Design Leaflet E.l.
The procedure for approval of instruments and equipment
carried on civil aircraft has been revised, and for certain
instruments in common use, Air Ministry requirements have
been embodied in Civil Instrument Specifications, which are
included in Leaflet E.l. Any instrument certified by an
approved test house (or in certain instances by the maker) as
complying with these specifications may be used. Details of
the procedure will be found in the leaflet.
(2/8/1934)
25. Compasses for Civil Aircraft
(184808/32)
1. Under Section VIII of the Air Navigation Directions,
1932 (A.N.D. 11) flying machines carrying passengers or
goods for hire or reward must, for flights which extend beyond
a radius of 20 miles from the point of departure, be fitted with
a compass which is of approved type and is maintained in
working order.
2. A list of approved types of compass for this purpose is
no longer included in Design Leaflet E.l of Air Publication
1208. Instead, Civil Instrument Specification No. 9 has been
issued in Part II of that leaflet by Amendment List No. 39
to Air Publication 1208. Civil Instrument Specification No. 9
lays down the requirements which must in future be fulfilled
by compasses carried as prescribed under A.N.D.11.
3. In future, before any new compass is installed as
prescribed under A.N.D.11, a certificate from the Admiralty
Compass Observatory, Slough, Bucks, or other approved
testing authority, must be produced, stating that the compass
complies with Air Ministry requirements as laid down in
Civil Instrument Specification No. 9.
4. Certain compass manufacturers approved by the Air
Ministry for the purpose, are authorised to issue such certifi-
cates of compliance for their own products.
5. Attention is drawn to the facilities provided by the
Admiralty Compass Observatory, by which aircraft owners
may have their compasses checked for calibration and
functioning under normal conditions, for a fee of ss. o d. The
tests made under this arrangement are for the assistance of
owners and do not cover all the requirements of Civil
Instrument Specification No. 9.
(21/8/1934)


26. B.T.H. Magnetos, Types A.V., S.V. and S.C.: Protection
of Contact Breaker Rocker Arm Springs against Corrosion
(350542/34)
1. Contact breaker rocker arm springs for the above
magnetos should be straw colour when fitted ; a blue dis-
coloration indicating corrosion, at first in irregular patches,
and ultimately uniformly over almost the entire length of
the spring, may occur after a short period in service, followed
by failure of the spring.
2. All contact breaker rocker arm springs should be
examined and, if free from signs of corrosion, varnished with
flexible, air drying, synthetic resin varnish, in accordance with
the procedure described in para. 3. Springs showing any
signs of corrosion should be replaced by new varnished
springs.
3. The main and auxiliary springs should be removed from
the contact breaker and washed in petrol to remove all traces
of grease. A thin even coat of varnish should then be applied
to both sides and edges of the springs with a clean brush, and
the springs hung up separately to dry at room temperature
for twenty-four hours. No varnish should be applied to the
contacting faces of the springs, which should be cleaned and
polished bright to ensure good electrical contact.
4. The springs should be re-examined regularly at frequent
intervals and any found to be discoloured, whether owing to
failure of the varnish coating or otherwise, should be rejected.
The varnish should be renewed when necessary on springs tree
from corrosion, i.e., it cracking, flaking, or accidental scoring
of the varnished surface has occurred. The old varnish must
not he removed by scraping, but by immersion for two or
three seconds in dope solvent and wiping with a clean rag.
5. The flexible, air drying, synthetic resin varnish, and the
dope solvent required for removing the varnish, can be obtained
from Messrs. British Thomson-Houston Co., Ltd., Alma Street,
Coventry.
6. The Certificate of Airworthiness of any aircraft fitted
with magnetos of the types referred to, will he liable to
suspension or cancellation if the action described in paras. 2
and 3 has not been taken within three months of the date of
this Notice. Certificates of Airworthiness will not be renewed
and ground engineers must not sign daily certificates in
respect of such aircraft after the expiration of the afore-
mentioned period unless the work has been correctly carried
out.
(26/8/1934)


27. B.T.H. Impulse Starters, Type L
(340715/34)
1. Failures of the above impulse starters have occurred
from inadequate lubrication and due to the locking washer
under the main fixing nut binding on the body.
2. Impulse starters fitted to base mounted magnetos
should be lubricated every 25 hours with 8 to 10 drops of
thin machine oil introduced through the hole in the side of
the impulse starter. Impulse starters on spigot mounted
magnetos, being contained within the engine casing, normally
receive sufficient lubricant.
3. A hardened steel distance washer, Part No. CX.55223,
has been introduced by B.T.H. modification No. L.l to be
fitted underneath the tab washer, Part No. CX.53096, and
the main securing nut, Part No. CX.53095, in order to ensure
perfect freedom of movement between the body and the hub
by eliminating any possibility of the tab washer binding on
the body. The new washer, and further details of the
modification, can be obtained from Messrs. British Thomson-
Houston Co., Ltd., Alma Street, Coventry. It is recommended
that the modification be incorporated on the next occasion on
which impulse starters are dismantled.
4. Impulse starters of the above-mentioned type should
be dismantled and examined internally for wear every
400 hours, attention being given to the following details ;
(а) The driving member should be replaced if the
stops have worn more than 50 per cent, of the diameter of
the stop.
(б) The hub should be replaced if the wear in the
slots exceeds 1 mm. Any burrs round the slots should
be removed before reassembly.
(c) The bearing pins for the pawls should be extracted
and, if the wear on the pin or in the hole exceeds -010 in.,
the parts should be replaced.

30. Landing Lights
(305245/34)
1. The Air Navigation Directions, 1932 (A.N.D.11) para-
graphs 63 (1) (v) (g ) and 99 (1) (/), require aircraft to be
equipped with landing lights (lamps or wing tip flares) of an
approved type for flights by night when passengers or goods
are carried for hire or reward or when a pilot qualifying for
a “ B ” Licence is carrying out night flying tests.
2, The types of landing lamps at present approved for use
on civil aircraft are, as shown in Leaflet E.l of A.P.1208,
Harley, Vickers-Phillips and Carl Zeiss Landing Lamps.
These lamps are approved subject to the proviso that an
accumulator is fitted to obviate fading of the light caused by
the aircraft losing speed.


3. Wing tip flares of “ Holt ” type H. 7 (2 minutes), are
also approved when manufactured to Y.S.C. Specification
No. 21, dated sth April, 1933, and to Drawing No. Y.S.C./1281E,
dated 4th April, 1933.
4. The construction of the brackets and their position on
the wing of the aircraft must be such as to prevent the flame
from the flare overheating the wing or aileron fabric when
the aircraft is in flight or standing on the ground. If necessary,
wing or aileron fabric in the vicinity of the burning end of the
flare should be protected from overheating by metal sheathing.
Provision must also be made to ensure that the light from the
flare cannot dazzle the pilot by reflection from the windscreen.
5. Adapters made for “ Holt ” flare brackets of the
Yorkshire Steel Co., Ltd., to permit the use of Royal Air
Force flares, should he removed and the brackets restored to
normal to take the approved flare.
6. The practice of carrying an unused and unprotected
flare in its bracket under a plane for any considerable period
of time is strongly to be deprecated. The effects of damp
atmosphere and rain, especially under flying conditions, are
harmful and cumulative and, in an extreme case, may result
in either total failure or dangerously irregular burning of the
flare when eventually ignited.
7. Flares should not be fitted to the aircraft until immedi-
ately before the particular flight during which there is a
reasonable expectation of their use being required, and
should be carefully re-inspected on each occasion. Such
re-inspection is to consist of: —
[a] A visual examination of the flares to confirm that
there has been no apparent swelling of the content, no
apparent deterioration of the outer case and no apparent
entry of water or any foreign substance through the
sealing compound of the igniter element at the top of
the flare.
(b) An electrical continuity test to ensure that the
igniter is intact.
Note. —Whilst there should not be any danger of the
flare igniting if the test is properly carried out, the
possibility of accidental ignition must be realised and due
caution observed.
The flare should be tested in the open and away from
all inflammable materials. It should be positioned
pointing away from the operator, who should be shielded
from the flare.
The test should be carried out using a two-volt battery
and 1100 ohm earphones. These should be connected in


series with one terminal of the flare and when contact
is made with the other flare terminal a “ click ” will be
heard in the phones if the igniter is intact.
A flash lamp and battery should not be used for
testing flare igniters.
8. Flares should be stored under suitable conditions when
not in use, that is, they should be protected in store from
weather, dampness and undue heat. Before a flare which
has been carried in an aircraft is returned to store, it should
be wiped with a dry cloth.
9. Flares or igniters must not be used after the date
specified thereon.
10. Aircraft owners are reminded that the fitting of
landing lights to an aircraft may affect the airworthiness of
the aircraft and they should, therefore, ensure that the
modification has received prior approval from the Air
Ministry before being embodied in the aircraft. In this con-
nection reference should be made to Notice to Aircraft Owners
and Ground Engineers No. 74 of the year 1931.
