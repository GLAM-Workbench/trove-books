PREFACE.
IN placing my poems before the public, I wish to
show that every portion ot them is possible with my
own life, and, to do this, 1 must give a brief outline
of my own career.
I am a direct descendant of the once famous
(Watts). My parents came to Australia in 'sl or
’52 of the last century. They were poor and Hum-
ble, but wise and willing. They lived for thirty
years in Alma Street (South Sydney). 1 was rather
wild, and ran away from home wlien ten years of
age, and battled my way with no other help but my
own industry, till 1 got blind at the age of forty-
three. 1 educated myself from scraps ot newspaper,
oillheads, and other sources, till 1 became a duly
qualified mining engineer. To get to this point,
with no other means but my Own industry, it is
needless to say that 1 had many a downfall in life,
and, as years rolled on, 1 had to note that every
failure in life was caused by the want of knowledge;
but, 1 am pleased to say, that after every failure 1
was gallant enough to make another stand, and as
1 look back upon the past 1 have to note that the
possibilities for wisdom were unbounded, and I do
not wonder at the (Great Tyson) and the famous
Hordern, with hundreds of others, making their
marks on Australian history. With their wisdom,
and the opportunities surrounding them, they could
not help being what they were —moulders of the
British Empire—and all the time they were forging
to the front. There were thousands in Australia
starving through lack of knowledge, but too wise
with ignorant conceit to profit by the lessons every
day before them. All this suffering poverty wanted
a convenience made for them, and Australia had
none; it was nude and wild, but fertile and rich,
with unbounded possibilities for those who were
ready and willing to make their own convenience
out of everything around them. So it is little to be
wondered at when we hear of the two extremes,
wealth and poverty, in a country like Australia.
But the poverty is not caused by the lack of oppor-
tunities, as is stated by thousands, but the want of
knowledge. For every time 1 fell in life 1 naa uu
trouble in making another start —my readers will
ask why! When I was hungry I either used my
agility or my gun, and dead game made very good
food, until 1 had time to turn around with either
skins, timber, stock, or metal, tor the market. This
is the life of all trades, coupled with the farming
productive possibilities of Australia. I will here
note the cause of much failure. Lots of people
when they have little want much, and, of course,
they cannot get the much out of the little they have;
but if they were to wait a bit, till they got the much,
they would soon become rich, or well enough to do
for them to laugh at poverty. There is another
cause of much failure and distress —excessive gam-
bling and drink. This does not harm much with
the thrifty, because when they are broke, as they
call it, they make another start; but with the wage-
earning ignorance, that everywhere abounds, it is
the cause of much trouble, privation, and misery
for these people. Whenever you mention the possi-
bilities of an undeveloped country to them, they will


always ask what they are going to get. Of course,
this is plain to any wise man or woman. If they
give nothing they can get nothing, and in a nude
country you have to make all out of the undeveloped
possibilities around you, and 1 venture to say, from
practical experience, that there is a thousand times
more wealth in Australia undeveloped, hungering
and thirsting for knowledge to develop it, and put
it on the market, as conveniences to meet the wants
and human wishes of all these people that want
much. And I repeat the former —a thousand times
more wealth in Australia ready to be developed
than there is developed at present. Now, my
readers will certainly ask, how does the author know
this ? It is quite plain, for I spent twenty years as
a prospecting miner between the tropics of Capri-
corn and Cancer, but mostly in the British Empire.
With this opportunity, and my varied knowledge of
ways and means, 1 saw much and thought much
as I viewed while passing them. The undeveloped
stratas of His Majesty’s Empire, and 1 certainly say,
without fear of contradiction, if it were possible to
induce every British adult subject to take his portion
of land and use it to the best of advantage, the
British Empire would be unequalled in the world’s
history, either past or future. And I say, without
fear, that it is the unbounded duty of every British
subject to do what I have foreshadowed in the poems
I now place before the public. Hoping sincerely
that they will be well enough patronised as to enable
me to place upon the market a much larger volume,
together with the whole of my notes on what I saw
while prospecting and travelling in Australia and
the Oceana group.
THE AUTHOR.
INTRODUCTION TO “ODE TO SAM HOR-
DERN’S DEATH.”
Dear Readers, —
It is with pleasure I write these few lines to the
memory of the late Sam Hordern, one of the most
prosperous retailing - merchants in the Southern Hemi-
sphere. He was a thorough progressive business
man in every sense of the word, for he satisfied his
customers and employees to the letter of perfection,
for when he died not a word was hurled at his
character, and the reason I wrote this poem is as
follows: —I knew a blind girl who for years stood
in the front of his emporium, sometimes singing,
knitting, etc., for a living, and he never passed her
without helping her, and would never allow her to
be molested. But, alas ! she is dead now, as well
as the late Sam Hordern and his father. Both of
these gentlemen rose from nothing, as the poem des-
cribes. They planted industrial trees or trades,
which are still growing, and it is to be hoped that
his sons will follow in his footsteps. For what the
working man wants in Australia is organisers of la-
bour to a profitable end to all concerned. This is
what builds up an empire. The late Sam
Hordern was always more than generous, for he
always gave, and never talked about it, and the rea-
son his business grew so rapidly was his honesty to
all the purchasing public, who honoured him with
their trade. A child could be sent by its parents,
and no advantage would be taken, and an order could


be sent from the most remote part, and this likewise
would be executed with the utmost faith and res-
ponsibility to all concerned. He was a sober,
shrewd, and intelligent man, and so was his father:
he shunned gambling to excess; he always believed
in moderation in all things pertaining to human in-
dulgence, and it would be well for the Australian
youth to follow in the late Sam Hordern’s footsteps,
and his father’s. They started with nothing, and
thrived with honest business mottos, and there is
more chance now to rise than there was when Sam
was born in 1849. This was before the golden era,
when men had to work for all they got. But plenty
work, strict economy, and sober intelligence soon
made its mark, as the poem describes.
ODE TO SAM HORDERN’S DEATH.
On Brickfield Hill in ’forty-nine,
Beneath the Southern Cross,
Sam Hordern breathed the breath of life,
But now we mourn his loss;
He was our Great Industrial Chief,
In dear old Sydney town,
ms workmen number thousands,
And his honour was renown.
He gave alms to all the needy,
Afflicted, maimed, and poor,
He found work for the hale and strong,
Around each factory door;
His trade advanced with science,
He never lagged behind,
His object was progression,
Of every form and kind.
He saw Australia was endowed
With all of nature’s gifts,
Required to make an empire great,
from stratas, ores, and drifts;
He knew that timber, coal, and shale
Would make his native land
The centre for industrial craft,
To use its magic wand.
He marked Australia’s progress,
With his national thrift and will,
Upon the place where he was born,
With business tact, and skill;
He made himself a millionaire,
Out of the struggling past,
Go see his great emporium,
You’ll say it’s growing fast.


To be the largest of its kind,
Filled with our tradesmen’s skill,
Supplying every human want,
From factory, farm, and mill;
When Sam was born Australia was
So very poor and weak,
That spears and clubs and marsupiials
Had domineering cheek-
But when her mineral, mould, and stock
Made rich this southern land,
He bought the place where he was born,
And made his final stand;
He built his fine emporium,
The grandest place on earth,
This showed the world that Sydney was
A gem of priceless worth.
He showed Australia was the place
Where every man could live,
To own a thriving happy home,
If they would only give
It all their toil and wisdom,
Shun gambling, drink, and crime,
lois is the way “Sam” wrote his name
Upon the sands of time.
Sam Hordern’s father sowed the tree
That blooms on Brickfield Hill,
With every kind of national wealth,
From furnace, ranch, and kiln;
He started poor and humble,
When all was nude and wild,
To grow this great industrial tree,
When Sam was but a child.
The old man with his wisdom knew
That Sydney had to be
The London of Australia,
So his will did decree,
That his firm should keep on growing
With native thrift and will
Until it was the tradesmen’s mart
For all our federal skill.
But now Sam Hordern’s dead and gone,
We hope his next of kin
Will keep his emblem growing,
And be as good within.
For he kept his trade expanding
Right through the mother State,
His motto was “Fairplay to all,”
He shunned a gambler’s fate.


His workmen placed a token small
Upon their master’s grave,
To show he was their honoured chief,
And not a tyrant knave;
They laid his body in the grave,
With due respect to all,
His spirit went to heaven above—
It heard the Master’s call.
Vve know Sam Hordern’s spirit soul
Will plead in heaven above
For God to bless his native land
With virtue, truth, and love;
We know he’ll help his loving wife
To bear her natural loss;
Great God of love and duty,
Help us all to bear our cross.
THE AUTHOR’S STARTING POINT IN
LIFE.
When I was young and full of life
I ran away from home,
Full bent on being a hero bold
Like those of ancient Rome;
I stowed away aboard a craft,
The “Bertha” was her name;
She traded to the River Tweed,
The land of Cedar tame.
The Tweed it has an area
Of the richest land on earth.
Here every kind of timber grows
Of great commercial worth,
Here every kind of fish and fowl
That nature has set free
Came there to spawn and lay their eggs
To fill this land with glee.
Here fleas, ticks, snakes, and leeches live —
It was the black man’s home;
Here every kind of vermin thrived —
It is their natural zone;
They lived upon each others form
Among the mountain soil;
They feed the fowl and other life,
All this is nature’s spoil.


The mountains round this magic scene
Of incubating life
Will some day grow tea, spice, and scent,
To please both man and wife,
That’s living near the trickling streams
That’s everywhere around.
How this will please old nature
When she hears the joyful sound
Of all their little children,
When playing in the sun,
Or in the evening twilight,
All enjoying childish fun;
Then all the dangerous reptile life
Will have to disappear,
To make room for a grander life
That no one needs to fear.
When I was on the mountain top
That heads Joe Robby Creek,
I saw old nature hard at work—
This made me very meek.
I was above a thunder storm,
Where all was clear and bright;
Beneath me in the valley flats,
There all was black as night.
I viewed this scene quite serious—
My parents used to say
That all rain came down from heaven—
But where was I that day?
Why, I was on the mountain top,
Where all was clear and free,
Above this mighty watery cloud
That flooded fern and tree.
Just then old Scott and Brady came.
Says Pat: “You’ve gone astray;
Come on, my boy, we’ll take you home—
It’s raining in the bay.”
When we got down the mountain side
The rain had cleared away,
But every place was flooded there—
This was no gentle spray.
The hail was still upon the ground—
Oh! what a wonder sight;
Just think, abo\e this raging storm
The sun was shining bright.
We told them home what we had seen;
They all cried with dismay:
“We want none of your fairy tales-;
Please tell the truth and pay.


Attention to our grilled fish,
Corn cake, tea, spuds, and rum;
This made them all confiding friends,
But I felt very glum.
Twas here I got my first set back,
From charming Biddy Scott;
I tried to woo, but wooed in vain—
She blocked me on the spot
So I left here sad and silly;
The Logan was my dart;
And there I found another girl,
Who cured my aching heart.
This girl—l meant to marry her;
She gave her solemn vow;
But when I went to Brisbane, friends,
My mate made her his frow.
Then I worked in the sugar cane
For two long years heartsore;
’Twas on Redland Bay Plantation
I passed my maiden score.
Then I reviewed myself—a boy
Stowed in the “Bertha’s” hold,
Found by the cook when out at sea,
So dirty, sick, and cold.
That day I made another vow
That I would never wed;
I shipped aboard another craft
And chummed with Yellow Fred;
Then we traded round the Islands
For three more years or so;
Then Fred—he dreamt he was a fish;
We took the hint to go.
We left her in St. Laurence Bay
In Eighteen-seventy-one;
Next year Fred got killed by the blacks—
His last words were “I’m done-”
As I rolled him in his blankets,
My heart, it throbbed with pain.
We buried him beneath the tree
I ne’er shall see again.
Fred’s father was a convict bold,
His mother was a queen,
Her father was the Abo. chief
That ruled the great Nepean.
Some months before Fred told me all
About his father’s life;
He said, “Well, Alf, I’ll tell you this—
My mother was his wife.


My father loved his Abo. friends,
1 hey were so kind and brave,
They let him live to hunt and fish
Above Teresa’s Cave,
Old Warrangambia was so true,
He would not take a bribe;
My father won his daughter’s hand
And died one of his tribe.
How he got there I do not know
He must have run away—
My mother fell in love with him,
And I am here to-day.
I never knew my father’s name;
He called my mother Queen;
The foreign coins around her neck
Told wonders he had seen.
My poor father lost his foothold
Upon the mountain side,
And fell five hundred feet below,
When he was sixty-five.
I was about ten years of age
When my poor father fell;
My mother saw him miss his hold—
Oh, Gilles! she did yell.
My sister heard dear mother’s call,
And soon was by her side.
My mother cried, ‘Your father’s dead!
But I am still his bride.’
My father was a mangled mass,
I never shall forget;
They buried him with all his spears,
Canoe and fishing net.
My mother jumped into the grave,
The tribesmen pulled her out,
And sent her to a distant place,
And guarded her about.
For years my mother was quite mad.
One night she had a dream;
My father’s spirit came to earth,
And told her she was queen.
God gave her back her reasoning power;
She was herself again—
She knew my father was alive
Upon the spirit plain.
But this is forty years ago—
I must be getting old; —
She told me then I had to go
And win the white man’s gold.


I had a half-cast sister, Alf,
She was a kind, good girl;
She owns by right the hunting ground
Around old Gambia’s whirl.
I will go next year to Penrith,
To find my father’s grave;
I’ll have enough to keep them all,
Round Warrangambia’s cave.
I’ll build a hut near father’s grave,
If Gilles is alive;
My mother cannot live for long,
She must be eighty-five!
I’ll get some fowls, some goats and bees,
And live there like a king;
I could make clothes from ’possum skins—
I’ve got the solid thing.
Yes, I will get a little boat,
To fish upon the stream;
This will please my loving sister,
And carry out life’s dream.
I promised for to go with him,
And see my friends as well,
And prospect all the country round
Where Warrangambia fell.
Now Fred is dead and I am blind,
Our parentage forgot;
The aboriginal is extinct,
In evolution’s pot.
The next is “Warrangambia’s Dream;
Will be a mighty fact,
Evolving from the crude and wild,
Each scene will be an act.
That’s going to plant industrial seeds
In all our children’s minds;
To grow ambition, thrift, and craft,
To nourish all mankind
Into a conscientious state,
That everything must toil
To win the comforts of all life
From metal, rock, and soil.


WARRANCAMBIA’S DREAM.
Kind friends, I m going to tell you all
About the Abo. bold,
Who owned the great Blue Mountain wilds
With all their wealth untold.
Of course, they had their dreamers,
Like the scriptures tell of old,
W r ho told the past and future lot
When they were in God’s fold.
King Pharoah had dream visions,
And King Cyrus had them too;
But Joseph showed clairvoyant sight—
Could tell them what to do
To overcome the evils
1 hat all systems do prepare.
So let us cultivate the mind
To evolve every care.
All down our long historic age
God inspired men with dream,
To peer into the future lot
Of every struggling team
Of human evolution
lhat is on their endless track,
With science, thrift, and enterprise,
In their industrial pack.
Each soul retains its history
Upon its thoughtful chart;
No one forgets dishonour, friend—
It makes us sick at heart
lo think that it impairs our lot,
Where honour is the light
lhat wins the badge of happiness
For all our earthly fight.
St. John and Jonah saw in dream
The past and future picture scene;
While Gideon, with clairvoyant sight,
Saw God’s dictative angel light,
Who said you have to kill the foe
lhat makes your present mortal woe.
Then Gideon with God’s magic wand
Went forth and saw each warrior band.


This shows to all that spirit power
Can help us through each trying hour.
For underneath the sycamore
God fed Elijah, sick and sore.
This shows progressive spirit life
Can help us in all mortal strife;
So let us give them every chance
To help us use tools, mind, and lance.
Then we could teach all savage tribes
The way to lead more useful lives,
By cultivating mind and soil
To feed all systematic toil.
I know the fathers of our race
Are ever watching for the place
To use their theosophic light,
To show the wonders of the night.
Why does old Sydney slumber
When kind nature has decreed
That she should be a workshop
With five million mouths to feed?
The mines within her radius
Each mark their crystal streams,
As they flood the Nepean basin
With Warrangambia’s dreams.
This ancient Warrangambia,
He was a chieftain brave
Who fell upon the battlefield *
Close by Teresa’s cave;
He ruled all the creeks and gorges
That form the great Nepean,
The wildest but the grandest sights
That ever man has seen.
These rock bound wonder chasm creeks,
Numbering many score,
Have chopped and rent the mountain sides
For fifty miles or more;
Just like as if the mountains quaked,
Letting the waters creep
To form these dark blue watery glens
One hunderd fathoms deep.
Near to the rocky basin
There’s a cave upon the hill,
There Warrangambia dreamt the dream
That laid his body still.
Yes!—He dreamt his land was mighty,
With lakes filled to the brim,
Swarming with fish and wild fowl,
And too wide for him to swim.


And he dreamt that all his gorges
Were blocked with solid stone,
And the tortoise roamed in freedom,
But his tribes were dead and gone;
Then the white men came in thousands,
And built their cottage homes
Upon the margin of these lakes
That covered up their bones.
In dream he saw these strangers
Mould mineral, clay, and sand
Into every shape and form
Devised by human hand.
All his forest groves were missing,
The native bear was dead,
The mocking birds and marsupials
And emus all had fled.
He saw a host of motor boats
Travelling to and fro,
With every kind of merchandise
Kind nature could bestow
Upon a thrifty people
All radiant with desire
To make Australia mighty
With their intellectual hire.
He saw men in the aeroplanes
Ascend and soar in space
As graceful as the eagle did.
He wiped his fearful face,
To view the great steel bunyip guns
Pour forth their deadly hail
Upon a glittering army;
He heard them moan and wail.
Then in dream he saw his birth-place,
An orchard in full bloom,
With every kind of fruit and wine
Stored round the factory loom.
Then he saw a glorious light,
That brightened up his cave;
With this he viewed himself quite dead
And lying in his grave.
And then he saw a mighty war—
His land was filled with strife.
Five million Asian Warriors came
To right the wrongs of life.
Six years they faced gorilla war;
At last they turned and fled,
Leaving upon our northern shores
Four million Asians dead.


The night the old chief had this dream
His heart was filled with spleen;
He waged war with his neighbour tribe
And passed through nature’s screen.
To all this is a lesson sad
That indicates the right
For us to help kind nature on,
By doing what is right.
Warrangambla’s Dream.—Part 2.
Old nature formed these gorges, friends,
So picturesque and grand,
Inviting men to dam them back,
To irrigate our land.
This would make the Nepean delta
Produce herbs, fruit, and grain
To feed the hungry, heal the sick,
And banish grief and pain.
The waters in these brooks and glens
All sparkle with delight
At old Sydney’s future greatness,
When men will use their might
To drive five hundred water wheels;
Employing human hands
To manufacture, grind and spin
The products of our lands.
Why—they could form electric might
To drive machinery day and night;
Producing such a wonder sight—
There’s untold wealth in water might.
Picture lakes and fairy bowers,
Tourists’ wealth midst ferns and flowers;
There spending all their leisure hours,
And mixing gold with human powers.
Why—all the Abo. spirit tribes
Would give this such a cheer,
That would make foes stand and tremble
Whenever they came near
To rob us of our metal wealth
That stratas does conceal;
We could defend Australia’s shores
With native arms and steel.
All these mines have gold and silver,
Iron, lime, and other ores;
They’ve coal to warm and shale to light;
Yet Penrith sleeps and snores.
She ought to be a Manchester
Beneath the Southern Cross,
And trimmed up with British ivy
And irrigated moss.


We ought to have a Glasgow,
And a Sheffield, too, as well;
We want one hundred arsenals
To make our shot and shell.
But we must build a Birmingham
Beneath these southern skies,
To make our household cutlery,
Guns, swords, and butchers’ knives.
Mind—all our skill is needed
For to meet the coming strife
Predicted in the old chief’s dreams
Of our progressive life.
Do come forth, ye men of wisdom
And rulers of our fate;
Stir up our national greatness
Before it is too late.
Then high upon the mountain sides,
In every valley nook,
You’ll find the apiar’s cottage home
Close by the rippling brook.
There you will find the artist,
With the poet and the scribe,
All taking notes of what’s been done
To perfect nature’s bribe.
It’s all about the mountain heights
That overlook the sea,
The background to Port Jackson’s shores
This forms the western lee.
To Botany Bay and La Perouse,
And Sydney, too, as well,
World tourists all exclaim aloud—
Oh, what a lovely dell!
Now this will be a paradise
More charming than the hold
Where aboriginal tribes lie dead
And buried in the mould.
All waiting to be born again,
To see the wonder sight
That Warrangambia saw in dream
Before his fatal fight.
Are we to die like Gambia’s tribes,
Without a national mark?
No; let us build a big stone dam
At W r arrangambia Park.
Yes, this will show for ever, friends,
Upon the sands of time
That British pluck and wisdom rules
Beneath this southern clime.


Now let us pile up energy
All round this mighty scheme,
By making it a living fact
And not an idle dream.
Port Jackson will be noted
For its bright electric light,
And Sydney’s wealth and beauty
Will be dazzling to the sight.
Then we could feed and clothe the world
From our industrial mart;
We’ve all the raw material
To play this active part;
We have everything that’s needed
To make an empire grand.
So let us build a Fed’ral Fleet,
And populate our land.
And this will help old England, friends,
In any future strife
That’s caused by plotting nations
To mar our national life.
But peace, goodwill, and progress
Will be our national theme,
While we grow strong and wealthy,
With our great commercial scheme.
But Australia’s full of heroes
And champions of all sport;
She is just as good at science
And trades of every sort.
She has stock—one thousand millions,
And metals in galore;
We must not waste our precious time,
We’re British to the core.
And if old England wants us
To defend our native right
We will fight like British heroes
With wisdom, strength, and might;
We will man our arks of freedom,
Like our fathers did of old,
All shouting “Rule Britannia,’’ boys—
We are one mighty fold.
Old Warrangambia’s spirit
Now urges this appeal
For us to work with wisdom,
So that he may reveal
To us the hidden treasures
That nature does conceal;
The medium of all comfort, friends—
Gold, silver, coal, and steel.


Some day there will be millions
Where we have the thousands now,
And if we are not brave and wise,
These folks will be the Chow;
And they will build a Pekin, then,
Beneath this Southern Cross,
And if this ever does occur
The dragon will be boss.
Wentworth would be the charming spot
Where Buddha’s warlike band
Would lay the bricks in Christian’s blood
To make his temples grand.
So let us teach gorilla war,
Would shoot dead every foe
Who dares to land upon our shores
To make this world of woe.
We’re all sons of British heroes,
And rulers of the south,
That’s going to invent ways and means
To fill the dragon’s mouth
With all our home-made shot and shell—
This is our future fun;
We mean to do it neat and clean
With our great Federal gun.
And when the dragon’s got enough
He’ll rush across the line,
And cry “No Savee’’ bunyip gun
That broke those ships of mine.
While pointing to our northern coast,
As they oft done before,
They’ll cry in disappointed tones,
“No Savee’’ fight you more.
OUR GRACIOUS QUEEN VICTORIA.
Our gracious Queen Victoria
Sixty-three years did reign
Over all the British people
That stretch from main to main.
They made for her an empire,
Five hundred million strong,
And their hearts all beat with union,
Progression, love, and song.


Now she is an Angel Queen
In heaven so bright above,
And pleading with the great I am
For wisdom, power, and love
For all her British people
That’s in every foreign clime
Now printing “Rule Britannia”
Upon the sands of time.
Victoria Dei Gratia,
When she was but a girl,
Was crowned Queen of the British Isles
Amid a chartist whirl
Of sad discontent and clamour
That filled her court with fear
That something cruel would happen,
But her Hebrew God was near.
To inspire all her councillors
To be human, just and brave,
To meet the people’s trouble
With a sacrifice to save
Old England from the penalties
Of civil war and strife,
By giving every British born
More liberty in life.
And this made Britannia mighty,
So wealthy, strong, and brave,
That all the world respected her,
As Empress of the wave.
And now her flag, the union jack,
It waves on every shore;
No nation ever did the same
In any age before.
Our jolly tars —God bless them all —
They are old England’s pride;
They fought and conquered every foe
Upon the rolling tide.
They battled aown the pirates —
A cruel and heartless set
Of brigands in the Eastern Seas—
Into the devil’s net.
Yes, they man our arks of freedom,
One thousand vessels strong;
They mount the top of every wave
With peace, goodwill, and song;
They surveyed every ocean strand,
And laid it down on chart;
Their every rocky danger shows
How Jack has played his part.


He is no drone on nature,
For he works with honest zeal
To place upon the scroll of fame
Victoria’s private seal.
This private seal is sacred trust,
Right from the tribe of Dan,
Who drifted on the Irish coast
A persecuted clan.
There a noble prince of Ireland
Took from them his wife,
The only princess royal saved
From persecuted strife.
This Hebrew spring of vital life
Rushed through this princely clan,
Until it fused Victoria’s veins
With Hebrew blood from Dan.
This is an ancient story, friends,
So very strange but new;
This gives our King a sacred right
To shield the friendless Jew.
All the Hebrew clans were slaughtered
With wide world hate and frown,
Until Jehovah placed his seal
Upon the British crown.
KING OF PEACE AND KING GEORGE.
The King of Peace was living,
He wore the British crown,
He had a diplomatic voice
In every foreign town;
He bade all kings be peaceful, friends,
And yield despotic might,
Or else the democratic bomb
Will blow them out of sight.
His mother, Queen Victoria,
Was great in word and deed;
His father was a Saxon prince,
The choicest of his breed.
But the world was moved with trouble
All through his parent’s reign;
The British lions had to fight,
Their prestige to maintain.


And this made our King so mighty,
So human, just, and brave,
That he had no armoured escort;
He only lived to save
The world from pain and famine,
The natural spoil of war;
And when his august mother died
He showed he loved the Boer.
His first act, when a King by right,
So generous, just, and true,
Made every Transvaal native sing,
King Edward, we love you.
Since then they have been loyal friends,
So thrifty, just, and kind,
That he gave to them the franchise,
His Empire for to bind.
Then he travelled right through Europe
To stop the cannon roar,
And made the world more peaceful
Than it ever was before.
There he met the mighty Kaiser,
And Russian Czar so grand;
He pleaded till they sheathed their swords
And joined his peaceful band.
All the Indian rajahs
And monarchs of the East
Sing praises of King Edward
At every national feast;
He is loved by every sultan
That rules Mahomet’s land,
And every Buddhist in the East
Would shake his peaceful hand.
He was honoured in the palace
And every cottage home,
And every black man’s bungalow
Wherever you could roam.
The noble Czar of Persia,
And all his glittering train,
Declares the King of Peace will come
To rule on earth again.
For he was no bigot monster,
Who would wield despotic might
Against the faithful Buddhist,
Or Mahomet’s sacred right.
He said that God was merciful,
True, honest, just, and wise,
That all good men and women would
Receive his heavenly prize.


Now George the fifth is on the throne,
He heads the British race,
He travelled round the earth for lore
To fill his father’s place.
He saw the cities of the earth,
He knows their every need,
And means to make the wrong the light
By every thought and deed.
He was a sailor brave and bold
And spent his time at sea
Upon the British man-o’-war
That keeps the ocean free
From all marauding pirate knaves
That’s on the ocean wide;
But when he settled down in life
He took Mary for his bride.
To carry out his father’s wish,
A thing ne’er done before;
This was to keep his name quite clean
From anything impure.
He did it with great credit, friends;
For when he was a boy
He lived a wise and jovial life,
But shunned impure decoy.
He sang our songs upon the deck,
Just like a middy brave,
And never once forgot to shout,
“Britannia Rules the Waves!”
He travelled round the Austral coast
And every southern isle,
And did the same on Afric’s shores,
Zambesi and the Nile.
He travelled all the Eastern clime,
And Western world as well;
He saw the earth and all its zones,
And through the Dardenelles.
No monarch ever did the same
That ever lived before;
He roamed to learn the whims and wants
On every land and shore.
He never had a tyrant’s mind,
Or feared assassin’s wrath;
He never had an escort
Whenever he went forth.
He knew some day he’d be a king—
His father was three-score; —
He lived to earn his people’s love;
What could a man do more?


But now King Edward’s dead and gone,
And he is George the fifth,
We pray that God will use his mind
To give the world a lift
Out of the grooves of discontent
That makes a human hell;
We hope he’ll teach all monarchs
How to love each other well.
King Edward, with his mother’s guides,
Will visit all the spirit tribes,
To get more thrift, success, and might
To make his empire strong and bright.
He says will, energy, and heart
Will play a very active part
In helping George upon the throne
To settle all his torrid zone.
The King of Peace with spirit might
Will steer Britannia with God’s light
Into the haven of success
With honour, wealth, and happiness;
Where every parent love desire
Is nourished by the God of hire
To manufacture social bliss,
A pleasure Britons should not miss.
With all the surplus British race
So anxious for to get a place
To live contented on the soil,
To feed on nature’s willing toil,
That’s ever anxious in the front
To move creation with its shunt
On to the goal of heavenly light,
Where British wisdom shines quite bright
An unseen presence by my side
Dictated this quite clear;
It said, “My friend, you have to write,
You have no need to fear;
I am the man you’ve just described—
You make me feel quite proud;
I’m going to tell you what to write.”
He then spoke clear and loud:
“Why are we discontented
With the laws we make ourselves
To rule the home of everything
That’s on our pantry shelves?
Why do we rail at wisdom
When it’s struggling to the top
To benefit creation?
Why, it’s nature’s strongest prop.


Our wisdom directs energy
To all inventive skill;
This is the age of science
In our great industrial mill.
Our wisdom with its knowledge
Should take all nature’s growth
From where it will decay and rot
To where it is of worth.
This will employ the kindreds
With energy and will
To manufacture and enjoy
Another country’s skill.
Our sulphate ores and native growths,
That everywhere abound,
Provide the means for willing hands
To mine and till the ground.
This reproduces everything,
A thousandfold or more,
To feed and clothe the people
On every land and shore.
Here is the social question,
It is so very plain,
Old nature grows the forest belts,
Fruit, cereals, roots, and grain.
God made the minerals, moulds, and rocks
And florine bed so grand;
He made coal, shale, and precious gems,
And all the desert sands.
God invites all the human race
To think and do what’s right
With every bit of nature’s growth,
For comfort, food, and might.
To stimulate the system,
To which we all belong,
With peace, goodwill, and progress,
Truth, honour, love, and song;
And if we use our liberty,
With knowledge in our hands,
There is unfold wealth and grahceur
In metal, mould, and sand.
Old nature, she is in the front
With all our human hire,
With everything prepared for craft
To perfect its desire;
To make this earth a paradise
For muscle, brain, and bone,
To cultivate all nature’s zeal
Up to the highest tone.


Let our wisdom direct labour
To make, think, work, and find;
There is everything in nature
To suit the human mind.
But mankind heads all nature’s growth,
With duties to perform;
He eats to live, to mould and make
More perfect life and form.
So let us plant the hillsides
With more luscious fruits and vines,
Protected with rich timber growth
Of cedar, teak, and pines.
This will improve the ways and means
For every kind of toil
To enjoy everything they make
From products of the soil.
But our people want more knowledge
For individual thrift,
To make and win more national wealth
From stratas, ores, and drift.
Our earth, it is kind nature’s store,
This no one can deny;
In it is everything we need,
So let us work and try.
We ought to help the struggling poor,
Without the natural gift
Of seeing where to place their toil,
To give themselves a shift
Out of the grooves of poverty,
Where none should have to dwell;
This incubates the sad remorse
That fires traditional hell.
But our scientific knowledge,
And wise inventive power,
Is like the little busy bee,
Employing every hour
In making artificial lakes,
By damming back the streams;
They make grand mansions out of rock
To perfect ancient dreams.
They make our motors, bikes, and cabs,
And aeroplanes besides;
We have their floating palace now
To cross the Ocean wide.
We all admire the picture scenes
Displayed upon the wall,
Of science and inventive skill
Matured for public call.


This shows the evolution
Of all metal, mould, and rock,
To suit the great Creator s mind
Among His human flock.
This shows that everything m space
Subjects itself to man,
Because his wise discretive power
Is God’s redeeming plan.
Our earth supplies the ways and means
For individual toil
To make a world of happiness
To feed on nature’s spoil.
Our conscience solves this problem wel -
We have no right to share
The proceeds of another’s toil
Unless we pay the fare.
With our own toil and wisdom,
Or with something we possess;
This is the conscientious way
To live and not distress.
All nature does its duty well;
Why do we lag behind,
To make a world of discontent,
To impede trade and mind?
Now, friends, I am going to tell you this—
We all must do our share,
So let us be a people
That is wanted everywhere.
Why do we hate the middle men ?
This is a social blot —
His organising means procure
The needs for home and cot.
The middle men of England
Have made the British race;
Their minds and means have planted thntt
In every dismal place.
You will find them in the parlour,
With atlas in their hand; . .
They make a mark —exclaim, that place.
Our business must expand.
They send out men with transport means
To exchange surplus stock;
This plants progressive enterprise
That no one dares to mock.
They built up trade and commerce
Where all was nude and wild —
Just picture Oceana,
With her spears ana clubs all piled


Against her unused forest trunks,
Above oil, coal and shale,
With no progressive enterprise,
Amid Abo. shouts and trails.
There every kind of national wealth
Is underneath the soil,
That’s rich enough to feed the world,
And all it wants is toil.
It wants the British unemployed—
This is their national right;
The middle men have cleared the way
There is no need for fight.
Why do you breed rebellion?
This is a national loss;
Come out and build up happy homes
Beneath the Southern Cross.
Ye men of wealth and wisdom
Provide the means for might
To settle on King Edward’s plains,
And you will do what’s right,
By building up Australia
With your wanting British braves,
That’s ever planting ways and means
To stop marauding knaves.
Our middle men are brave and wise,
This no one can deny;
They take the risk of everything
We want to sell and buy;
They trade away our surplus stock,
And give us in return
The comforts of another land—
Why do we stoop to spurn?
Their organising wisdom,
And speculative will,
Is ever watching for a chance
To feed old nature’s mill
With every kind of stimulant
That comes from mother earth;
They find us everything we want
For pleasure, trade, and birth.
They cross the mighty ocean wide,
They brave the heat and cold,
They travel through the desert sands
To mix up trade with gold;
They teach the little children
In every other land
That all is trade and commerce
That touches human hand.


How can we sell things all the same
In every country’s mart?
To transfer goods is labour —
That plays an active part
With every kind of merchandise
Produced by toil and brain,
That’s wearing out its system
On evolution’s plain.
All producers and consumers
Of science, trade, and art,
Are never close together,
But they load the dealer’s cart.
With our manufactured labour,
So varied in the price,
The bustler’s work is never good—
He cannot finish nice.
Some men are quick and others slow;
But who is it to blame?
The difference is, they both work hard
But don’t produce the same.
The bustler wants more knowledge,
The slow man wants more thrift;
The tricksters say, we’ll organise
A strike to make things shift.
This stirs up bilious discontent,
That mars our national life;
The unions say they’re doing good—
But ask the labourer’s wife.
Whv, they clog the wheels of progress
With poverty and crime
Committed by these angry mobs—
That’s wasting precious time.
Yes, they impede trade and commerce,
To suit strike congress mind:
This starves our wives and children
Now is this good or kind?
A strike don’t hurt the millionaire;
It crowns him with success.
He puts our rise on what we make —
This is their game of chess.
Let’s break trades vends and combines.
And union rings as well.
For a freeborn competition
With what we buy and sell.
Now struggling trade consumes trade’s dross
When tradesmen are on strike —
This makes the fat man very fit
To use his sovereign pike.


Against our chin-wags on tne stump,
Full bent upon a row;
They live upon commercial strife,
Just like the bandit Chow.
These agitating loafers
Are a scourge to all around;
They are no good for man or beast—■
Their place is in the ground.
Forcing up vegetation,
To feed some other kind—
More profit to old nature,
With a better form of mind.
Thank God, we have the wisdom
To see this wicked wrong;
We mean to close these gab shops up—
They’ve bled us far too long.
We will do it with the franchise—
This mighty power will show
These demons how to work and live
On what they sow and mow.
Success depends on wisdom, friends,
Displayed with human care,
Against the trickster of the earth,
We call the ‘Devil’s Snare’.”
THE ANGELS’ PROCLAMATION TO THE
BRITISH EMPIRE.
We ought to fix the interest
For all invested stock,
And cut down all State systems
That are breeding drones to mock
Our honour, toil, and wisdom
With their debauched words and deeds—
This fills our land with woe and strife,
And fornicating weeds.
Now law permits these weeds and drones
To feed on tax and spoil
Extracted from all honest folks
Of every craft and toil;
They champion every kind of sport,
To gambling, drink, and vice;
They lead us all in church and law,
And battlefields not nice.


They eat up every fatted calf,
They dress and live in style;
We work and slave to feed the lot,
But grumble all the while.
These tax-absorbing gentry
Are one hundred million strong;
They keep us all in fear and dread
Of what we know is wrong.
They’re on the corner of our streets
To jeer our daughters by,
They are our public servants
And our parliamentary fry;
They are wise in selfish cunning—
This makes our people bad;
Why do we let these tricksters live
On strikes and sporting fads?
For when they want to get more cash,
With lusty lungs they chime
The latest sport—we like it well;
They’re winning all the time.
And when their family gets too large,
Our patriotic mart
Will give them all commanding power
To make us play our part.
They officer our armies,
And navies, too, as well;
Our sons fill in the rank and file
That makes us bleed and yell.
This lot is ours—we made it all;
They are our kith and kin;
We ride upon each other’s back
For honour, gold, and gin.
But do not wrath rebellion—
This is selffinurdering drudge;
Make every system equal,
From the navvy to the judge.
No one should get a pension
More than fifty pounds a year
For any service rendered—
Now this lot is hard to bear.
Why do we tax the poor and weak
To feed the rich and strong?
This is the curse of nations, friends;
Now don’t you think it wrong?
Our gambling, sport, drink, lust, and crime
Have made us poor and meek.
Despise the lot, be wise and good;
Our dollars will then speak.


OUR MIDLAND ECHO.
Eighteen hundred and sixty nine,
Upon the Capricornal line,
I dreamt I had to spend my time
In building up your northern clime
Into a land of social fame,
Where everyone can play life’s game.
Upon the soil we all must live;
Why don’t we live a life to give
To all an equal chance to thrive?
This is an end we must contrive.
Our fathers entered in this race,
And never had a second place.
They improved all this southern land
From spears and clubs, stone, ores, and sand;
They made it all with human hand,
Assisted by Jehovah’s wand.
Why don’t we do the very same
By building up a land of fame
Upon the north and western shore?
Our fathers did the same before.
There are the spears and clubs and sand,
There are the minerals, rocks, and land;
There is the harbour’s just as grand;
There is Jehovah’s magic wand.
You have the metals in the earth,
So make it into wares of worth,
And trade them with the people north
For silks and satins, oils and cloth.
Why do we beg upon the streets
When we could win the food to eat?
We have the land that we can treat,
We can build a Federal Fleet.
Here fairplay must be common l^w,
But guided by the lion’s paw;
And we must cut the eagle’s claw
Whenever he attempts to chaw.
The British band that’s round the earth—
A prize we won, and know its worth;
So we must watch the dragon’s wrath,
Or he will settle on our north.
With all this surplus youthful race
The dragon means to go the pace.
This foe Australia has to meet,
And if he lands he’ll be no treat;
But we will have to make him run—
Alas! this will be painful fun.
The boxer he is strong and brave,
When roused he will his country save.


He’ll break up every foreign yoke—
We’ll have to watch these boxer folk.
The remedy I here set forth—
Let’s build up commerce round the north;
A railway trunk to every port,
And this will stop the dragon’s snort;
Now let us be a noble race,
And step right into father’s place.
Rockhampton is my starting point;
My dream will fit with every joint.
Then you were but a struggling town,
Now you’re a city of renown.
But then you had no prison cells,
Your music was the bullock bells;
But now you have them both quite grand—
Your music is the city band.
You have grand trees to shade your street,
Your blocks and metals—what a treat!
For shade you had tree stumps instead, *
Your roads in rain were a slush bed.
You have a shaded lover’s walk,
Kept clean, with seats to sit, or stalk;
You’ve steps right to the water’s edge,
Your river now has got a dredge.
Your railways run north, south and west—
This Capricornal line is blessed;
Here alligators once did roam,
It was the Aboriginal’s home.
Mount Morgan was a barren spot,
But now she is a golden plot,
With everything that’s rich and grand
Produced from soil by human hand.
The Fitzroy was old nature’s nest
To breed all kinds of torrid pest;
But all this had to disappear
To improve life and banish fear.
Old Sol, the sun of life and light,
Has planted here the British right.
Rockhampton is old England’s might,
For all her Capricornal fight.
Old Sol declares that here must be
The means to keep our midlands free;
You want your millions on the soil,
Producing comfort with their toil.
You have the irrigating means
To fill your lands with picture scenes;
You could produce electric might
To run your factories day and night.


Then your industrial bells will ring,
Our farm and factory girls will sing;
Thank God that we can woo and wed!
Our children now can earn their bread.
You’ve everything you can desire
To set your midland belt on fire
With every kind of human hire
National grandeur can aspire.
You’ve copper, silver, gold, and lead,
You’ve everything that science bred.
Why are we dawdling on the street?
Why don’t we grow wool, grain, and meat?
Why aren’t we fishing round our coast?
This was our fathers’ national boast.
Now whales are often round our shore—
Old Bobby Towns would have their gore!
Our rocks, our minerals, clay and mould
Will make our country strong and bold.
If we will only give our might
We will be foremost in the fight
For everything that’s great and good
Produced from furnace, farm, and wood.
Now let us do our level best,
And we will beat the great North West.
At every kind of handicraft
From palace to the “Dreadnought’s” shaft;
But we must plant our inland plains
With forest belts to draw down rains.
These belts should stretch from north to south
To protect crops of every growth,
From winds that dry up every sprout—
The cause of fire and inland drought.
This forest scheme we should not shirk,
It ought to be a national work;
Then farmers on the eastern side
Would get the means to stem the tide.
Now this is how we all can start
To play an active national part,
By printing on our northern charts
“This is our Federal School of Arts.”
Now let us work and do what’s right
To please the God of life and light,
By cultivating mind and soil
To help old nature in her toil.
To grow more crops of fruit and grain;
To nourish thought and banish pain.
Now let us make each other free
To cultivate thrift, joy, and glee.


This land it is our children’s right;
Why do we wrangle, strike, and fight
Upon this incubating plot
Where everything is reared and got?
Our fathers won this handsome gift
With bravery, honour, work, and thrift.
We are the children of these braves—
Why are we starving round their graves?
Let’s take each other’s sister’s hand
And form a pioneering band,
To mature all the ways and means
That’s hid behind old nature’s screens.
There’s everything a people want,
But they will have to make and plant.
Go out and win, do not be late,
There’s everything on nature’s plate.
NATIONAL SONG OF GREAT BRITAIN
AND HER COLONIES.
Friends, we are the Islam world,
With the Union Jack unfurled,
And our duty is to make a land of worth
Out of every savage tribe
Who will sell their friends for bribe,
For we are God’s chosen power upon this
earth.
Chorus.
Advance boys, sing, and banish folly,
Subdue every foe that’s in the way.
Is our father’s spirit dead?
No; we ought to be ahead.
Let us make another start —Hip, hip, hoo-
ray, ay, ay!
We will make another start this very day.
We came from the tribes of Dan,
God’s almighty trading clan,
And we ever mean to follow in their right.
With Victoria’s private seal,
Rolled in copper, gold, and steel,
We will show the world that wisdom is God’s
might.
Chorus.
Advance boys, sing, and banish folly,
Subdue every foe that’s in the way.
Is our father’s spirit dead?
No; we ought to be ahead.
Let us make another start—Hip, hip, hoo-
ray, ay, ay!
We will make another start this very day.


With our federated east,
And our cousins in the west,
Dear old England never needs to fear a foe;
And our Oceana south,
With Australia’s metal mouth,
Means to help old mother banish want and
woe.
Chorus.
Advance boys, sing, and banish folly,
Subdue every foe that’s in the way.
Is our father’s spirit dead?
No; we ought to be ahead.
Let us make another start —Hip, hip, hoo-
ray, ay, ay!
We will make another start this very day.
Encore Verses.
King David’s pride and glory
Now lives to tell the story
How old England suckled wisdom at her
breast,
To overcome the evil
That tempts the wide world rebel,
For this is Jehovah’s resurrecting test.
Chorus.
Advance, pray, sing, and banish folly,
Converting every sinner on the way.
Is Emanual’s spirit dead?
No; we ought to be ahead.
Let us make another start this very day,
day, day!
We will make another start —Hip, hip, hoo-
ray!
With our British tact and skill
We’ll invent the means to mill
Every foe who wants our sacred rights to mar,
And the lion’s golden claws
Will make void all tyrant laws
With the light and might from every British
star.
Chorus.
Advance, pray, sing, and banish folly,
Converting every sinner on the way.
Is Emanual’s spirit dead?
No; we ought to be ahead.
Let us make another start this very day,
day, day!
We will make another start —Hip, hip, hoo-
ray!


Emanual he is coming
To slay all wicked cunning,
Who are eating up the vitals of our race.
Why are the people wanting,
With mind and soul fermenting,
While the earth gives everything to make the
pace?
Chorus.
Advance, boys, work, and banish folly,
Converting every idler on the way.
Is our father’s spirit dead?
No; we ought to be ahead.
Let us make another start this very day,
day, day!
We will make another start —Hip, hip, hoo-
ray!
POEM.
Sir Harry Rawson’s reproach and advice to the
young- men and women of the British Empire,
through Alfred Watts, the Blind Poet, after he laid
the foundation stone of Trinity Church, Jamieson
Town, near Penrith. Synopsis of the advice is as
follows: —
Your idlers breathe vile discontent,
That makes the human brain ferment;
Their bilious liver, mind, and frame
Can incubate a world of shame.
They feed upon the people’s toil,
And boast it is their natural spoil;
They prowl about the streets at night,
Plotting ruin, sport, and fight.
They spread disease, disgrace, and pain;
Why do we let these demons reign,
To print upon the sands of time
Australia is the home of crime?
Now, boys and girls, be wise and brave,
Your idleness will never save,
Exchange your non-productive sport
For scientific trades and fort s.
Go buy a gun, and keep it clean,
To stop invaders’ wicked spleen.
They mean to rob you of your all;
Be sure your aim will make them call,
“0, God, have mercy on my soul
Before they roll me in the hole,
Where all marauding knaves must dwell—
This is a self-atoning hell.”


Where all is wretched and forlorn,
And wishing they were never born;
Wallowing in their self-made scorn,
Midst’s grinding pain of every form.
Reviewing every evil done,
Cursing the hour it first begun.
To play a part in wicked fun,
Their sad remorse says you’re the one.
Now, please to note the lines just read
Shows plain the end we all must dread;
Let each one take an active part
To cure a lazy, wicked heart.
Our cigarettes they are a curse,
Excess with drink is ten times worse.
The Bible says the gambling blot
Will end up in the devil’s pot.
Kind mothers, teach your children this,
Hard work makes comfort joy and bliss;
Wisdom comes from heaven above
To fill this earth with perfect love.
Tell them this is old Nature’s creed,
To manufacture, grow and feed;
This is the triune code of life,
The balm for all our mortal strife.
INTRODUCTION TO “THE ABORIGINAL’S
DOWNFALL.”
Dear Friends, —I sincerely hope that you will care-
fully study the following- poem, for I may say I wrote
it while I was thinking seriously over the possibility
of its being the means of showing the young Aus-
tralians that they possess by natural right one of the
finest countries in the world, with everything in it
to manufacture and produce all the comforts that
an intellectual people could possibly require. The
poem shows plainly how our fathers took it from
a dilatory, savage population, quite nude of all
things, namely, they wanted no comforts such as
clothes and other necessities: they were quite con-
tented with the same comforts as a brute beast of
the field; they inhabited caves, tree shelters, and
such like; they lived by hunting and killing the mar-
supials and bird life indigenous to the Australian
Continent; but this was not all of their faults; they
were a divided people, with brutal notions and hat-
red for one another; they had hundreds of different
tribal chiefs, commanding not more than 500 fol-
lowers; each chief and tribe considered the other
one foreign to themselves; this feudal hate kept them
always in dread of one another’s powers, and made
them an easy prey to our fathers’ wishes to make and
leave a heritage to their children. Our fathers wrote
their names on the sands of time by conquering this
undesirable people, who had no more wants than the
beasts of the field, namely eating, drinking, sporting
and pleasure, without organisation or wisdom. Now,
what I want to convey with the following verses is
Do not let our children be found wanting, like the


Aboriginal of Australia was; they must not be divid-
ed with religious haie or national grievances among
themselves; they must be one people, without racial
hate to one another, and ready at any moment to
bury all invading hosts beneath their grassy sward.
If our children take this warning, and not be the
same as the Australian Aboriginal, sporting idiots,
without ambition; let them be an industrial, scien-
tific, conquering people, like their fathers were of
old; this, with intellectual organism, will make Aus-
tralia the New Jerusalem of the future, and they will
be without doubt the Islam people spoken of by all
ancient prophecy, with Divine right, power, and
comfort.
THE ABORIGINAL’S DOWNFALL.
Sixteen hundred and seventy-six,
Australia’s eastern coast
Was lit up with danger signals
At her approaching host.
It was on a summer’s morning,
Quite early in that year,
Brave Dampier landed with his crew,
Amid terrific cheer.
His cannons boomed along the coast,
The natives fled with fear,
And told their wives and children
That they heard these bunyips swear
That they would break the mountains up
To build upon the shore,
To fish, and hue their forest down,
When they would be no more.
This filled them full of wonder thoughts
At what was going to be,
But they were too much divided
With feudal hate to see
That they ought to be united,
To join with one accord,
To bury all invading host
Beneath their grassy sward.
They watched brave Dampier leave the coast,
And when far out of sight,
They prayed these great sea bunyips
Would have a fatal fight.
For ninety years they feasted on
This famed memorial spot,
But never heard or saw a sign
To mar their social lot,


Till they got news from Botany Bay
About brave Captain Cook
Sailing right in, with all his crew,
To sketch it on his book.
But when he laid it down on chart,
He found brave La Perouse
Had been there quite an age before
Upon a Southern cruise;
When Captain Cook took home this news,
All England cried aloud,
“Go back, annex Australia’s shores” —
This great man felt quite proud.
Then eighty years Australia was
Great Britain’s finger-post,
Where lash and gallows paid the the fine
For all her rebel host.
But Henry Parkes and Doctor Lang
Made free this Southern clime
By stopping this cruel convict trade—
And not before its time;
Then came the Hargreave metal boom,
Australia’s golden age,
This made Great Britain proud of what
Was once her convict cage.
This filled our land with heroes,
That stretched from shore to shore,
Who battled down the Abo. tribes
With a guerilla war.
These tribesmen would not come to terms,
But feasted on their flocks,
And used their spears with wondrous skill
Against the old flint-locks.
These brave men built their station homes
Right through our Southern lands,
Until they reached Port Darwin’s shores
Beyond the torrid sands.
But, alas! they fell in thousands,
Whilst hunting herds and flocks;
The men who threw these deadly spears
Were hid among the rocks.
As time wore on these natives got
So much of vicious fight,
They only made guerilla raids
Upon a full moon night;
But these raids got less frequent
When they found that Mr. Wait
Was watching with a well primed gun,
With slugs to seal their fate.


These braves were all inventors of
All ways and means of craft,
And they made Australia’s greatness,
Loading our transport raft,
With every kind of merchandise—
Wool, tallow, hides, and grains,
Their beef and mutton, horns, and hair,
Load up our railway trains.
They found copper, gold, and silver,
Coal, shale, and other ores
Too numerous here to mention,
In our great metal cause,
That’s covered up with blacksoil plains,
Most lovely to behold,
The nursery of all human wants,
That’s bought and sold for gold.
Now, this should be a warning, friends,
To all invading host,
Australia’s pioneers won’t miss
A foeman target post;
The aboriginal taught them how
To wait upon a trail,
To always find and never miss—
A dead man tells no tale.
BRISBANE’S FUTURE GLORY.
Brisbane, you have a future
That has never yet been told;
You are the coming Hamburg
Of our mighty Federal fold;
You have a lovely river,
That could form electric might;
You ought to irrigate your land—
Why don’t you do what’s right?
But you want one hundred millions
To till your inland soil,
Then you would be the centre
That would represent their toil;
With all your varied factories
Drove by this water-power,
You ought to be the milling port
For all Australia’s flour.


Why don’t we use our inland streams
To increase human powers?
They could torm one hundred lakes
To draw down heavenly showers; ,
And this would help kind Nature,
Who would give us in return
One hundred times our labors
For to feed the human churn.
Brisbane’s a powerful centre,
With a bright commercial fame,
And means to play a mighty part
In every Federal game;
You have a railway system
That will drain your inland belt
Of every kind of merchandise
That language has yet spelt.
Now, this should build up factories,
Make this your special aim;
Brisbane is an active spot,
A wealthy Federal claim.
So teach your children how to work,
To make their fatherland
A guiding star to all around,
With plough and sword in hand.
Mind, Brisbane should run neck-and-neck
With Sydney in the race
For grand commercial honors
Among all the British race;
At present you are handicapped,
Old Sydney’s in the lead,
But you will find petroleum springs—
These will your treasures feed. ,
This should induce your children, friends,
To make a gallant stand,
To use their skill and energy
To improve their native land;
To grow flax, jute, and cotton,
Out on your Western plains;
Your artificial lakes could grow
The fish for teeth and brains.
Bore holes in all your mountain sides,
Test well your flats and plains;
You will find the oil we want
In the subterranean mains;
They can extract oils and scents
From tree, fern, shrub, and flowers;
This is how our inland streams
Could feed brain, purse, and powers.


And they should not slave to gamble
With vile excess and sport;
When they have learnt their secrets,
They will find them dearly bought;
The lushington is just the same,
For, when his life is spent,
He’s rolled into a pauper’s grave—
All this he never meant.
So this points to a moral friends,
We must all bear in mind,
And if we do neglect it
We will always be behind;
It’s “Be honest, wise, and thrifty,
Shun gambling, vice, and crime,
Hard work will build your country up,
So make the best of time.
BRITANNIA’S MARCH TO GLORY.
King George declares the British race
Is going to save the world,
When everything is upside down
Their flags will be unfurled,
With all Britannia’s wealth and power
Behind the three in one,
The guide for all progressive love,
To say God’s will be done.
Chorus.
Upon this florine world of thought
Emmanuel means to reign,
Producing everything we want
With energy and brain;
Our troops they are so wise and brave,
They shout with one accord,
We want the world to live in peace,
And sheath the bigot sword.
The Bible tells a story, friends,
When two great powers will fight,
Then Israel she will get on top,
And trim her golden light,
For all to see Jehovah's seal
Upon the British Crown—
This is King George’s sacred right,
That has been handed down.
Chorus as befoie.


King Edward by his mother’s side
Is radiant with delight,
Because his son, King George the Fifth
Was crowned with Islam’s might;
He is King David’s natural heir,
Right from the tribe of Dan,
Created by the God of Life
To prompt the minds of man.
Chorus as before.
King George will lead the British race
On to the goal of light,
Where honour, thrift, success, and peace,
Will crown each day and night
With science and inventive skill
On naked, crude, and wild,
Evolving all to suit the minds
Of angels undefiled.
Chorus as before.
CAPTAIN COOK’S WARNING TO
AUSTRALIA.
I am the ancient Captain Cook,
Now in the Austral clime,
Taking notes of what’s been done,
In a century of time.
Good morning, Mr. Deakin,
I have come to you at last,
I heard you were Prime Minister,
I see that time nas passed.
So, please to take a warning, friend,
At what I’m going to state,
Australia, as a nation,
Is in a crumbling state.
I know you will not like it, friend,
Or any of your set,
But you have set her drifting, friends,
Into the Mongols’ net.
Of course, you will shrug your shoulders.
And so will Mr. Lyne.
But while you’re playing folly,
The Mongols say that’s mine,
But pointing wth his finger mind
On to our Northern Coast,
That’s where we Buddhists mean to land-
They are a helpless host.


See, they boast of White Australia,
And stigmatise our lot,
The coloured man was always brave,
We’ll wipe away that blot;
If they don’t come to meet us,
By doing what is fair,
We will wage war with their people,
And take all over there.
Australians, they are wealthy folk—
We are very poor;
We want their land—we will have it,
Or else an open door;
Now, all we want is union, boys,
You see that they have none,
See Mr. Deakin split them up,
And Georgie Reid’s near done.
All the Christians in Australia
Say we are going to hell,
But that don’t matter very much,
We like their country well.
Now, take heed, brave electors,
This Mongol plan’s not new,
It only wants an opening,
It’s an ugly nut to chew.
Make two ports free for twenty years
Out on Port Darwin side
To help our veterans make a home
To stem the Mongol tide
Of Asiatic fury
Against the Western World
For having marred Celestial rites
With blood-stained flags unfurled.
They mean to show the coloured race
Have equal rights and powers
From God Almighty, King of All,
Will, energy, and flowers.
Why are we not preparing
For this intellectual wave
Of new-born thought and enterprise
That means to fight to save?
The prestige of their patron saints
Who made their Eastern Clime,
The start of all parental love,
That marks traditional time;
Go, settle with your family
All round Australia’s coast
To stop this Asian fury
With each man at his post.


With plenty arms and wisdom,
And lots of men-o’-war,
All shouting “Rule Britannia,
This is our ‘Southern Star’,”
And we are here to guard it,
And ever on the spot
To shoot dead all who dare to come
To carry out this plot.”
And all who volunteer with might
Out in King Edward’s Land
Will surely write their names in full
Upon its wealthy strand,
Because their heirs will live to see
Their parents mark the chart
With deeds so brave all hands will sing
Our veterans played their part.
THE RUSSIAN CZAR.
The Russian Czar was might and pow’r
Before he waged a fight
With the little Jap called Nodzu,
With Ohieyama’s might;
This Western despot’s cruel threats
Against the Eastern World
Made old Buddha’s spirit tremble,
His flag he then unfurled.
The smallest of his Eastern States
Their flag, “The Rising Sun,”
Gave battle to this monster power,
Till they began to run;
His Cossacks rode with daring pride
Before the rising sun;
It rose, and rose, till strong enough
To stop their warlike fun.
They met the little Japanese
Upon the Manchu plain,
Who made them fight and cry for help,
But this was void and vain;
All the Eastern Gods of Justice
Came forth with shield in hand,
All saying to the Western World.
“This is our native land.”


All our people worship Allah,
The God of Life and Light;
The Rising Sun wll never furl
Till you are put to flight;
Then there came the mighty struggle—
The Russian armies fled,
But leaving on the Manchu plains
A half a million dead.
This cruel tyrant’s warlike pomp,
When charged with Buddha’s might,
Fell back into a tangled mass;
Ah! what a horrid sight;
For to see these blood-stained soldiers
All scattered o’er the plain,
And never more to stand and fight
The Japanese again.
One hundred times the Buddhists charged,
They charged once more, and won;
The Russians gave Port Arthur up.
When they spiked every gun;
But they left here broken-hearted,
A ruined, mangled mass,
And their countless dead and wounded
Were lying on the grass.
This moved the world with pity,
For the dying and the dead,
And the angels wept with anguish
Around each grave and bed;
Ah! this scene was never equalled
In any stage of life;
No tongue could tell its horrors,
Or its misery, pain, and strife.
Seven battleships, with cruisers,
Fifty-five ships all told,
Were sunk or captured in the fray
With Buddha’s Nelson bold;
They all form the Russian squadion
To guard their Eastern shores,
But alas! they all fell victims,
Predicted long before.
By one of England's nobles,
And Lord Wolseley was his name,
Who travelled in these Eastern Climes,
To watch this Russian game;
They meant to Russianise the East,
And make the Mongol slave,
To feed and clothe their armies,
But they found the jap too brave.


At last they sent a second fleet
Two hundred vessels strong—
These ships, the Russian nation thought,
Would right their Eastern wrong,
But they met the gallant Togo
In Takashuma Strait,
But the terrors of this meeting
Have sealed the Russians’ fate.
The Japanese with wondrous skill
Poured on their decks their shot and shell;
This fetched forth such a horrid yell,
This picture was a human hell;
Oh! what a panic-stricken mass,
All victims of despotic class,
All led by mules bred from this ass,
They sank a ruined, shattered mass.
THE POET’S DREAM.
Bright Hope! it is a blessing, friends,
That all mankind possess,
When backed with health and energy,
It always meets success !
Bright Hope ! it is the beacon
That points to Heaven above !
Bright Hope ! it is the stimulant
That urges man to love.
Bright Hope is on the battlefield,
It’s on the angry seas;
You’ll find it in the parlour,
And among the flowers and trees !
Bright Hope is on the sick-bed too —
It urges man to live;
It points to something beautiful
God never fails to give-
You’ll see it tripping down the street
With bright contented face;
It clasps its father round the neck—
This is our future race !
Bright Hope ! it makes the mother smile,
Again it makes her sigh;
As she wipes the faded picture
Her spirit child is nigh.


Hope forced the youth to leave his home,
To seek a foreign land,
For to win a name and fortune
To claim his true-love’s hand !
With Hope he charged in battle, friends,
But fate was there that day,
For to slay wild hope and folly
That had no right that way.
Bright Hope without discretive power
Is neither good nor wise;
False hope will lead its victim on
To win its phantom prize !
Bright hope is on our river flats,
It’s on our hills and plains,
It’s harvesting and sowing fields
Of cotton, fruits and grains.
Bright Hope is in the shepherd’s breast,
Out on the bush veldt main;
You’ll find it in the city slums,
’Mid poverty and pain !
How dark and dismal is the life
Where hope was once, and fled—
That man, he seeks to end his life;
All earth to him is dead.
When God withdraws the sacred wish
From every human breast,
Our earth is void of purpose, friends,
Mankind have lost their crest !
This would be a sad misfortune
For all the human race
To live without a future hope—
God grant this wont take place.
When my heart was full of sorrow,
And wished that death was near,
The spirit, Hope, came to me, friends,
And whispered—<lo not fear.
A thought ran through my stricken mind
That I was hopeless blind;
I cried aloud—God help me now !
Hope whispered—He is kind.
Then I shook with mortal torture,
My cup was full of woe,
I thought of ease in suicide;
Hope cried—l’ll kill that foe !
Once more I shook with terror,
For my head was one big pain;
Then my eyes, they burst with anguish—
Never to see again !


I fell exhausted on my bed,
And there I had a dream—
I saw myself the hero of
A mighty national scheme !
I viewed myself, so hopeless blind,
And lying on my bed,
Two spirit sages by my side,
These words to me they said—
“ Think everything in nature, friend,
That comes from planet mould,
Springs from an atmospheric germ
Created in God’s fold.
Each germ is charged with duty, friend,
And motion, power, and will,
Out their energy and wisdom
Turns round old nature’s mill.
All shrubs, flowers, fruits and verdure,
And crops of every kind;
All feed, mould, and clothe creation
To every form and mind.
There is nothing lost in nature,
All death and pains her will,
That stimulate progression
In her scientific mill.
Just view earth’s living splendour—
Why, it feeds upon its strife,
It lives to die and dies to live;
This makes progressive life.
All space is filled with knowledge, friends,
Of every sort and kind,
To suit the wants, the whims, and taste
Of every human mind.
Our earth is filled with minerals
To suit all trades of skill,
Employed to work up nature’s growth
According to God’s will.
The sun, moon, stars, the wind and rain
Are part of nature’s plan
That make this earth a paradise
For fish, fowl, beast, and man.
But man should use all nature’s gifts
With wisdom and desire,
To help the weak in mind and form,
To live upon his hire.
Now this would be a blessing, friend,
To all the blind and lame—
Why, they should have a special right
To work for food and fame.


Mankind should be God’s husbandmen,
To nourish planet life;
Mankind should sow to reap and mow,
Instead of making strife;
But our pain and want breeds knowledge
To fill in nature’s plan;
For all inventive science
Springs out of suffering man.
He is a blot on nature’s plan,
Who have no thought or care,
To feed and protect nature’s growth
His bones should be left bare;
Why should he eat up labour’s spoil,
And give none in return—
He ought to be remodelled, friend,
In good old nature’s churn-
But when nature’s wicked folly
Sows seeds of mortal strife,
Mankind should use his wisdom, friend,
To make more perfect life.
For to die it is transition
Intc another sphere
For all God’s living matter
That now breathes in atmosphere.
Trim up your lamps of wisdom, friend,
They are God’s human light
That beckons on creation, friends,
To think and do what’s right.
To all God’s living kindreds
Within your mortal sphere,
This will mould up your future life,
And fill your soul with cheer.
And be sure that you go forward
With evolution’s plan,
Instead of blundering backwards
With all the devil’s clan;
For this your soul must grovel, friend,
Through all your earthly crime,
Suffering all the pain and strife
Caused in your mortal time.”
A panorama scene passed by,
Of what I had to be,
Then there came a bright bronze statue,
I cried aloud—that’s me !
Then I asked the spirit sages
How this could ever be,
When I was hopeless, blind, and poor;
An echo cried—You’ll see.


The spirits said in tender tones,
We will be always near
To help you on to victory,
So never have a fear.
I saw the spirits fly away,
Then all grew very dark;
I cried aloud to God for strength
To make this heroic mark.
Then I heard some human voices,
The matron, she was near;
She said, ah friend, yourself again,
Some kind, good friends are here.
I cried, —Oh, dearest Matron,
Tell them to go away !
I am not dead—l cannot die;
But they knelt down to pray.
How long they prayed I do not know,
For I fell fast asleep,
Into the arms of Morpheus,
The goddess of sweet sleep.
When I awoke I felt quite fresh,
My eyes had ceased to pain;
A spirit said, you’ll see no more,
Now use your fertile brain.
Dear Readers,—
The night I wrote these verses, I cannot say that
I was truly myself, for I was clairvoyant and clair-
ordient, and could see and hear what had just been
narrated. But just at this point the scene changed,
and the following verses were plainly seen and
heard by me while in a partial unconscious state of
control. Although I knew perfectly well that I was
black blind without the least ray of light, I knew
that I was more than poor, for at that particular time
I was sued by “The Cloncurry Shire Council” for
rates due on land that I could not sell. But still I
was urged on to put before you in my penniless
condition the following poems. Hoping you will
read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest every word
of them, the same as I had to do. But I must say
with justice to my readers that I saw with my eyes,
before I got blind, the whole of the country des-
cribed in the poems.


SYNOPSIS OF THE POET’S DREAM.
This dream was in the poorhouse, friend;
Bright hope said rise, begin
'To stir your family’s sacred light,
It’s burning bright within.
John Milton was a guiding star,
You ought to be the same,
Go forth and write your name in full
Upoil the scroll of fame.
This earth it is one solid mass
wi angles, thrift, and skill,
Prepared to suit the human mind,
To mould, make, build, and fill;
Our homes with everything we need,
To make a perfect man,
To utilise all nature’s powers—
This is the angels’ plan.
The ox, the ass, the fish, and fowl,
And every other life
Have got their special part to play;
Why do we increase strife?
Sometimes we torture, maim, and kill,
And call it pleasure—sport;
Why do we tempt our God with this—
Some day He may retort.
The angels record every act;
Be cautious with your throe,
Or you may tumble through life’s screen,
Into eternal woe,
Where all your wasted time and means
Recoil with double force
Upon your painful, stricken soul,
So full of sad remorse.
I got these verses one fine night
From one we loved so dear—
Sir Henry Norman was his name—
His spirit’s always near,
To prompt our Federal members
To something great and grand,
And let us not be wanting,
For the time is close at hand.


When we shall have to guard our homes
From all the Eastern world;
Old Bhudda means to have his rights,
His wisdom is unfurled;
For all the Eastern people
To view their national wrongs,
That gave the Western world the right
To use their Christian thongs.
This made them poor and humble,
Quite wretched and infirm.
Bhudda says your national wrongs
Have made you like the worm.
The West is building ships of war—
Why don’t you do the same ?
You have the ways, the means, and power—
You must redeem your fame.
You, with five hundred millions,
Let a few men from the West
Come here and treat you just like dogs—
Why don’t you score your breast ?
You have a land that’s mighty—
Go ! cultivate your mind,
Turn out these warlike demons,
They’re a scourge to all mankind.
You own these Eastern deltas,
They are your kindred right—
Go ! show that Bhudda’s in the field
With all his spirit might.
Let wisdom subdue civil war
Beneath these Eastern skies,
Or else the Western nations
They will make you food for flies.
.Unite with one great effort,
Throw off this foreign yoke;
You are a beast of burden now
For all these Western folk.
They forced on you the opium trade,
With bayonet, shot and shell;
You used it like they did the drink,
To make a living hell.
Progressive minds should read and think
How Bhudda’s wise decree,
Foreshadowed in these verses,
Will set his people free.
To use celestial power and will
All round their Eastern shores,
They mean to break their Christian yokes
For now and evermore.


So let us rectify the wrong
We done the Bhuddist world;
Or else get ready for to fight—
The Eastern flag’s unfurled.
Australia is so close at hand,
And such a wealthy spot;
Make no mistake, we’ll get it warm—
We made the alien blot.
FIELD MARSHALL SIR HENRY NORMAN'S
WARNING.
Australia watched her tribesmen die,
Wood weapons could not save;
ihe white folks came and buried all,
Just like the deep sea wave.
And she watched their wise inventors
Pondering through the night,
Just like the poet and the scribe,
With their clairvoyant sight.
She knew her Aboriginal dreams,
One hundred years before,
Was inspired thought to save their race,
Like Pharoah’s was of yore;
But they were savage, nude, and wild,
With feudal hate and spleen;
They had no thought that enterprise
Would perfect all they seen.
We must not be divided,
Like the Abo. was of old,
Or we will be a conquered mass,
With miseries untold.
In dream, I saw a civil war
Amongst the British race;
Phis made the Abo. quite extinct—
Unite, and save disgrace.
Australia ! she is king of all,
She has the power within;
And when she gets the thrift and skill
Australia will begin
To shower metals, moulds and rocks,
With wisdom from above,
Provide the means for human skill
To produce all we love.


future glory.
From Melbourne down to Brighton
Is a trip you’ll ne’er forget,
For its artificial grandeur
Will hold you in its net;
Of cultivated beauty spots,
Most charming to behold,
There all the florine world is seen
That comes from nature’s mould-
Then you should see the Gippsland Lakes,
Where perch and trout are free;
Lonsdale is the sportsman’s home,
Where he could happy be.
But do not miss the Golden Grove,
Its mountains are so grand;
But when you view the Melbourne Lup,
Your hair will start to stand.
Melbourne has her sporting clubs,
Of every sort and kind;
Her champions and inventors
Are as good as you can find;
Her reapers and her binders,
And ploughs are going to show
They have the men with thrift and will
To settle every row.
Now Melbourne has her factory skill,
To supply North and South
With everything the people want
To suit the mind and mouth;
She’ll invent cannons, guns, and swords,
To improve war and sport;
Her sons are going to take the front,
To stop the dragon’s snort.
Industry is a special gift
To all Port Philip shores;
And when it stirs Victoria’s soul,
She’ll find the mineral cores
That will supply the means and power
To make Australia move
Off all her surplus stagnant stocks
Into its proper groove.
The Goulburn Valley—what a treat,
No poet could describe;
All round these rich alluvial flats
There is the gold to bribe.
The scientific future
T= croino- to test and find
Victoria’s wealth and glory
That is pictured in my mind.


We like to hear it jingle, friends,
It braves the heat and Cold;
We love it more than anything
That precious stuff called gold.
Here nature plays a funny part,
And no one seems to know
Why gold was put beneath the silts—
Ihis, science means to show.
Then there will be the millions
Where we have the thousands now,
And if we are not wise and brave
We’ll be slaves to the Chow.
Wentworth will be the Pekin
That s beneath the Southern Cross
Australia must not go to sleep
They’re pointing to our North. ’
Victoria’s Future Glory.
The Murray is a priceless gift,
url C ° uld su .PP l y a world of thrift
With all the irrigating power
To make your land a nursery bower;
To grow the seedlings of our clime, ’
lo print upon the sands of time,
Victoria s scientific chairs
Have looked right through old nature’s layers.
So try and solve the secret plan
She had to evolve mind and man
Out of the solid ether age,
When all was one transparent gaze;
ihere was no mineral, mould or rock-
All space was one huge solid block;
mu re was no whisky, beer or gin,
Then all was sober peace within.’
Where was the great Almighty King
Who made this mass one living thing
1 hat crumbled into atom life,
To make each other’s pain and strife-
By eating up each other’s gold,
To make a layer of virgin mould;
hen flow’rs and grass grew round the earth,
Ihen came the shrubs and trees of worth.


This fed a billion living kind,
Who rank beneath the human mind.
How did the oyster make his pearl,
Beneath the deep sea’s billows’ whirl ?
This must have everlasting light—
It never fades, but shines more bright.
God must have some great end in view,
For all things die to feed the new-
The spirits of our parents, friends,
Are watching every move;
Why are we wasting time and means .
They want us to improve,
They want us all to do the right;
So let us go ahead,
Complete the work they left undone—
This resurrects the dead.
Let us view the unused homesteads,
That sadly need repair;
They fed and sheltered thousands
Who are starving in despair;
The fruit trees, they look poor and mean,
They miss the old folk s toil,
Their fruit is hard, once soft and sweet—
The lot is vermin’s spoil.
All this is caused by gambling sport
This fills the bitter cup;
Our foes are making guns and ships
While we are shickered up !
We laugh at everything we see,
Instead we ought to think
The way to stop excessive sport
On oval, course, and rink.
But now we have the boxing fads
(They call it self-defence)!
But when this meets with sword and gun
It has a ghostly chance;
But the spirits of our great men,
With wise inventive skill,
Will show excess, will starve us all
To feed the trickster’s till.
Why aren’t we gleaning factors,
Like our parents were before,
Lying by their precious toil,
For when they were three-score.
Rise up ! repair their homesteads,
So wretched and forlorn;
Or else go settle in the North
To grow more fruit and corn.


Don’t go into the racecourse, friends,
The oval and the rink,
To act just like a giggling fool
That’s blundering to the sink,
Where the gambler and the drunkard
Will surely have to dwell —
Traditional scribes depict this place
To be a flaming hell.
Australian girls are beautiful —
This no one can deny;
Their intellectual smile declares,
All troubles we defy,
We’re going to be the mothers
Of a noble, gallant race
Of scientific, brave, good men
Who mean to show the pace.
And all the wise, inventive world
Australia means to lead;
We’re going to win, in peace or war—
This is our holy creed.
Brave Burke and Wills and Macintyre
Are pointing to the North —
Your sons and daughters must be there
To stop the dragon’s froth.
They died upon the black soil plains—
That is our children’s right;
There is nothing here to equal there,
You have the means and might
To take up all these Northern lands,
Beyond the Torrid Zones;
Your boys and girls will woo and wed,
And not be idle drones.
Our city girls are witty,
With their gestures or their frown,
They lend an air of beauty
To every village town;
They are always clean and tidy,
In factory, field, or lawn;
You’ll never see them dawdling
With a dirty dress, all torn.
They will all make charming mothers
In every grade of life;
You need not feai a city girl
When she becomes your wife;
She’s always at the wicket gate
To greet you with a smile;
She has your supper always hot,
Its never "wait awhile.”


Their mothers, they are prompting them,
’Mid flames of keen desire,
To make a world of thrift and love,
To feed our factory hire.
Where Burke and Wills and Macintyre,
And Leichhardt, too, as well,
Laid down their lives a sacrifice,
This is no torrid hell.
This land will incubate the life
That’s going to make a stir
Upon the corners of the earth
With cotton, grain, and fur;
But when our flax, wool, hides and meat
Is on the wide world mart,
The world will see Australia means
To play an active part.
We have our honey, wine, and fruit,
And cereals in galore;
But when our champions go abroad,
The people will encore.
Let’s go out to the Sunny South,
And settle down for life;
This is the New Jerusalem
That ends all mortal strife.
AN AUSTRALIAN GIRL’S AMBITION.
I am a bright Australian girl,
As happy as a lark,
And ever watching for a chance
To make a national mark;
I mean to do my parents’ will,
And tend them when they’re old;
I mean to be a brave, good girl,
And win them plenty gold.
I’m going to help the blind and lame,
Bedstricken and forlorn,;
I mean to show how youth should grow
Fruit, cereals, roots, and corn;
I’ll show the idle discontent
That wisdom, will and toil
Can manufacture every want
From mineral, rock, and soil.


I’m going to be a guiding star
To all the girls in town,
I’ll cultivate an angel’s mind,
And never wear a frown;
And when I lay me down to sleep,
I hope my God will say—
Dear little girl, you’ve done your best
To do My will this day.
I’ll serve my God by day and night,
Whatever it may be;
I’ll work with wisdom, truth, and love
To keep His royal decree;
And when my mortal time is passed,
I’ll plead in heaven above
For God to send me back to teach
His honour, truth, and love.
PART II.
Let me plead with all young ladies—
You all should be brave, wise, kind girls;
You must do your parents’ bidding,
Then you will miss the painful whirl
Always waiting for the wicked;
Do try to miss this awful doom,
Win the badge God gives the blessed,
Then you will see your deeds in bloom.
Now, young ladies, heed my warning—
All vanity and self-esteem
Leads you to a home of nothing, .
Where all your thought is phantom dream.
Truth and honour kills deception,
All wicked hate and selfish spleen;
Shun all evil with precision,
Then you will live and die a queen.
The Angels' Wish to the above Verses.
This is the angels’ longing wish,
That every girl and boy
Should be each other’s guiding star,
And not a vile decoy;
To rob each other of their all,
In treasure, mind, or toil,
This always ends in sad disgrace,
The pictured devil’s spoil.


0, friends, I with the angels, cry—
Why don’t we stop and think ?
Do not be like the gambling drunk,
That’s falling in the sink,
A dissipated, ruined wretch,
A nothing, none can miss;
The bible says there is no hope
For one who dies like this.
The angels want us all to think,
Before we further go
An erring sinner to the brink
Of everlasting woe.
At this all system seems to wink,
The hangman ties the bo,
The gaol doors bang, the leg-iron clink,
While sin goes to and fro.
THE AUTHOR’S DOXOLOCY,
Praise God, from whom all blessings flow;
Praise Him, all people here below;
Praise Him, as angels praise above,
With honour, wisdom, truth, and love.
We’ll praise the God who gave us life,
By helping all woe-stricken strife;
We’ll fill each heart with hope and joy,
By teaching every girl and boy.
The way to grow up wise and good,
By giving useful toil for food;
And this will help kind nature’s plan,
By building up a useful clan.
THE AUTHOR’S MORNING PRAYER.
In Thee, O, God, I put my trust;
To Thee alone I pray—
Please God to give me health and strength
To do Thy will this day,
O, God, direct my mind and will
To think and do what’s right;
With every bit of nature’s growth,
To evolve life and might.


THE AUTHOR’S GRACE BEFORE MEALS.
Please, God, look down and bless the food
That Pm just going to eat,
And let it nourish power and truth
To do a noble feat.
For 1 want to be an author,
Inventor, or a scribe,
With will to help old nature on,
As angels will prescribe.
A HYMN COMPOSED BY THE AUTHOR.
A Hymn composed by the Author, to be sung by
any Christian church congregation. ihe object of
the composer is that every man, woman, and child
could ask God in a chant of musical appeal to bless
the church, and all the doings within it, to which
they belong.
Please, God, to bless our little church
With wisdom, power and love,
For all who kneel beneath its roof,
To pray to Thee above.
God, grant their little children
May grow gentle, wise, and strong,
To do Thy will by day and night,
With pleasure, love, and song.
Oh, God, send down Christ Jesus,
To help all the aged and poor,
To cure the sick, the blind, and lame,
Around its sacred door.
And may eagh marriage contract signed
Shine bright with sacred proof
That it was crowned with heavenly joy
That day beneath its roof.
Oh, God, pour out Thy blessing full
Into its holy font;
And may each child that’s christened there
Be always in the front,
While it’s marching on to glory,
And trying all it can,
With every muscle, nerve, and thought,
To lift up fallen man.
God, grant the holy sacrament,
Christ gave to all in need,
May fill our hearts with love and joy,
To chant the holy creed.
And may the echo of our voice
Go straight to heaven above,
To imprint on its sacred walls
The name of Him we love.


And, God, grant its holy altar
Is filled with Christian thought,
To teach all its congregation
How dearly they were bought
By Christ, our blessed Saviour,
The great King of Calvary,
Who shed His blood to free us all
From sin and misery.
God, grant the laying on of hands,
Performed in days of old,
By Christ on His disciples,
Be more valued now than gold,
By all the Christian people
That’s around its doors for miles;
God, grant their children’s names are on
Its confirmation files.
THE ANGELS PROCLAMATION TO THE
BRITISH EMPIRE.
One night, as I lay thinking
Of the troubles that’s ahead,
King Edward’s spirit cried aloud—
Why are you filled with dread?
Australians should be happy folk,
And help in all that’s near,
To utilise their human powers
To kill hate, want, and fear.
The future of our Empire
Is so noble, great, and grand;
Its picture is so beautiful,
I have it close at hand;
But we must pull together,
With our wisdom at our head—
Britannia rules for ever, friends;
Your parents are not dead.
They are everywhere around you,
Providing ways and means
For mind to evolve matter
To beautify life’s scenes.
Your wisdom, skill and enterprise,
Provide in heaven above
The pleasures for parental thrift
To feed created love.


Then Kruger and his loving wife
Came forth in bright array !
Exclaimed —God bless the Union,
This is a glorious day !
But Joubert, he is coming here
With Cecil Rhodes to- night,
To celebrate the union of
Gold, peace, good-will, and might.
All through the British Empire,
That stretches far and wide,
Defender of all foreign rights,
She is Jehovah’s pride.
Then Berry, Parkes, and Dr. Lang,
With waratahs in hand,
Approached King Edward’s spirit throne—
Oh, what a heavenly band !
Then Edward tranferred all his rights
To his son, George the fifth,
Who Joubert said was wise and good,
And not a national myth;
Then they all addressed the Empire,
With honour, love, and song,
With words so full of wisdom,
Denouncing every wrong.
As I stood in silent wonder
Of what I seen and heard,
Sir Henry Parkes came close to me,
And pointed with his sword—
Go ! tell all the British people
We sanction this with pride;
Two hundred million copies
Must be scattered far and wide.
Across the mighty ocean wide,
On every land and shore,
To sow the seeds of union
That were never sown before.
They will show the British Empire
Is one great solid mass
Of science, trade and commerce,
With gold instead of brass.
This wealth is on our mountain slopes,
It’s in the torrent stream,
We have it on our black soil plains—
This is no phantom dream;
We have muscle, bone and sinew,
With wisdom, thrift and skill;
Let’s make it into commerce
And put it in the till.


Then we could face a famine, Friends,
Or fight a mighty foe;
We could help the aged and sick,
In sorrow, grief, and woe.
So let us be united, friends,
Let each game be a win;
But moderate your gambling sport,
Your whisky, beer and gin.
This will induce the great I am,
That rules the British race,
To inspire all our children’s minds
To take a higher place.
This will fulfil the prophet’s words,
Laid down in Jewish faith—
We are the mighty pow’r foretold,
Must stop all bigot wrath.
THE SHAMROCK, ROSE, AND THISTLE.
The shamrock, rose, and thistle
Have glorified the earth,
With peace, goodwill, and progress,
Ana subdued carnal mirth,
They showed that British union,
With its economic brain,
Could make a noble empire,
(Jur prestige to maintain.
The shamrock, rose, and thistle
Is the emblem of the brave,
That rescued Oceana
From her Aboriginal grave,
Their patron saints, with wisdom, zeal,
Have made their triun light
So bright that all the world can see
The good in Islem’s might.
The shamrock, rose, and thistle
V/ith their dreadnoughts, made of steel,
Are going to protect life and trade,
This fact they don’t conceal;
They mean to have industrial peace,
for all our trades within,
This gives us everything we want,
Australia must begin.


To open up her ways and means,
Old nature has the lot,
But we must work to win the cash,
To furnish home and cot,
With all the modern comforts,
That links coin, thought, and work
Into an exchange system
That Britons never shirk.
Our fathers worked with tragic might
To place the British seal
Upon the corners of the earth
With plenty wine and meal;
They scattered seeds of progress
In every southern isle;
They all sing “Rule Britannia” now
With a thankful, loving smile.
The shamrock, rose, and thistle,
They are the three in one,
That hoists on high “The Union Jack,”
•To say “God’s will be done”;
On all their British Island power,
That stretch right round the earth,
Ruled by Jehovah’s human star,
A magnet of great worth.
He is King Edward’s youngest son,
We crowned him George the Fifth,
He means to rule with wisdom’s zeal,
To give the world a shift;
He says “Advance Australia,
You are God’s Southern light,
That beckons on the Eastern world,
So think and do what’s right.”
Build up the British Empire
With your wisdom, power, and will,
Make her strong and mighty,
With your union, faith, and skill,
You are God’s chosen people,
Be human, just, and kind,
This is the only way, dear friends,
To show superior mind.
Be honest, wise, and merciful,
With all your wealth and power,
And God will give you twice as much
To stem the trying hour;
When all system is in kayosk,
This prophecy’s not new,
The Scripture says the British fleet
Must take the friendless Jew.


Back to the land of Palestine,
The home of Christian light,
Where all sectarian dogmas
Must vanish out of sight
Before the great and mighty “One/’
Who conquered sin and shame,
The Hero of Mount Calvary,
From Bethlehem Jesus came.
He is the great Messiah, friends,
Who will dictate the right,
To every man and woman’s mind,
With all His sacred might,
Upon the Mount of Zion,
Before all God’s angels bright,
Will be His resurected host,
Oh! what a wond’rous sight.
Then all round the Mount of Olive,
Will be the picture scene,
Of murderers, liars, thieves, and rogues,
Going through Jehovah’s screen,
Into the flames of torment,
That’s prepared for hateful crime,
To purify its system,
In a thousand years of time.
Their every wicked thought and deed
Is printed on the screens,
That’s round these conscious stricken souls
To taunt these wretched fiends,
Into an agonising state,
Of acute mental flame,
Fired up with guilt, each soul reviews
His own vile, wicked frame.
All mankind must undo the wrong,
They do in mortal life,
Or else each self-accusing pang,
Will cut them like a knife,
No tongue can tell the anguish,
Of these poor demented souls,
All striving to undo the wrong,
Marked on their earthly scroll.
With heart and mind distracted,
They all wander day and night,
To find the victims of their spleen,
Oh! what an awful plight.
Now all the ancient prophets say,
This is the sinner’s fate,
Christ Jesus says, Go, sin no more,
Before it is too late.


God gives us life and energy,
All kindreds have it, too,
tie gives the world progenial might,
But we have power to do
Our best for one another
In the land we love so dear,
Our duty is to cultivate
All nature’s growth to bear.
All the fruits of toil and wisdom,
For a thriving happy home,
Supplied with every comfort,
That’s enjoyed in modern Rome,
But we must be examples,
Of our honour, truth, and law,
And this will advertise the good,
Like Jesus did of yore-
The wise will never gamble,
And excess with drink’s a crime,
That suffer in the drunkard’s hell,
Why do we hamper time?
By building up a system
That will give us grief and pain,
Let moderation be our theme,
And we will live again.
To see our great Redeemer King,
Of all God’s earthly throne,
And hear His mighty angels sing,
All round its sacred zone,
Oh! how happy it will be,
This Christian joy of prophecy,
Let’s win salvation, it is free,
This is life eternity.
Where truth and love will be the fire,
That warms the heart of soul desire,
To manufacture social bliss,
This is a pleasure none should miss,
Up in the realms of heavenly light,
Each soul will have constructive might,
Where every atom gets its life,
To stimulate this world of strife.
Into a land of heavenly love,
Controlled by wisdom from above,
Here every child’s progressive bliss,
Will come straight from its parents’ lips,
Now let us all with one accord,
Go forth and show that Christ our Lord
Can save the world without the sword,
And we will get this great reward.


To The Drunkard.
The God of drink feels sorry,
All fruit, grapes, and grain should be,
Consumed to make fools jolly,
While they curse his wise decree,
But drink consumed in wisdom,
Would help all the human race,
To improve health and system,
While they are going the pace.
Let us be discreet and wise,
With all nature’s gifts to cheer,
We should never gourmandise,
On grain, spirits, wine, and beer,
All drink should be a blessing,
To the wearied, sick, and sore,
And not a hoggish craving,
For a bellyful and more.
In trance the Author saW the following - result,
which, should be carefully considered by all drunkards,
it being - the keynote to the poem just read.
Excess with alcoholic drink
Will lead its victims to the brink
Of bitter woe and blank despair,
Where all is tempest, nothing fair,
There in this self-accusing den,
You’ll find a billion frantic men,
And women pleading for the light,
Oh! what a dismal, horrid sight.
Discretion with the human life,
Will lead it through all mortal strife,-
Into the haven of success,
Where all will live in social bliss,
Excess with drink breeds weakness.
Debauchery is its aim,
Let honour, truth, and frankness
Remove all this self-made blame.
So let us use our sacred will,
To subdue thoughts that want to swill
Themselves with spirits, wine, and beer,
To drown the hopes of all that’s dear,
To every Christian loving friend,
Who wants to live a life to mend,
Up all the wrongs of systems’ growth,
By making this a land of worth.


All drunkards with their wicked spleen
Can make a horrid picture scene,
They transfer to their next of km
The evils of their self-made sm,
This reprints all their life’s disgrace
Upon their little children’s face,
To mark upon the sands of time
That drunkard’s filth bred woe and crime
Let’s subdue selfish, spleenal will,
Cast out the drunken thought that swills
Itself in whisky, beer, and gin,
To satisfy the lust within;
This is a maxim all should teach,
So let us act instead of preach,
Example is the only means
To teach our children in their teens.
Now let us make a stringent law,
To print upon the swiper’s raw,
That they are sure to go to hell,
To hear their drunken comrades yell,
We have polluted wine and beer,
A beverage meant to soothe and cheer,
The weak and weary, sick and sore.
For this we suffer evermore.
Now let us work with human might,
To please the God of life and light,
By cultivating mind and soils,
To help old nature in her toils,
To grow more crops of fruit and grain,
To feed the mind that rules the main,
Now let us make each other free,
To cultivate thrift, joy, and glee.
All vanity and self-esteem,
Stands smiling at the crystal stream,
But when it wants to get a drink.
Deception says, “I’m only ink,
You ought to shun me every time,
I’ll only lead you on to crime;
Why don’t you stop and have a think,
Before you tumble in the sink?”
THE GAMBLING DRUNK.
A gambling drunk lay sick and sore,
In stomach, limbs, and head,
A spirit whispered in his ear,
You would disgrace the dead,
You ought to be a thrifty man,
Without a want or fear,
Instead you are a filthy drone,
The dregs of wine and beer.


But here you are a ruined mass,
Of undecided life,
Without a sparkle of manhood left,
To help your struggling wife,
Your parents reared you on their farm,
And cleared it, too, as well,
But when they died you sold the soil,
For fuel to make this hell.
When you control your parents’ wealth,
You wed your cousin Kate;
Before two years, to her surprise,
She was a tyrant’s mate;
You squandered all the old folks’ cash,
In racing, sport, and drink,
But here you are a human wreck,
That’s tottering on life’s brink.
You jeered at all your neighbours’ plans,
As you went gabbling round,
That racing was your favourite sport,
T 1 win or lose a pound,
You backed your tips and fancies,
And dead birds by the score,
You had your straight wires from the jocks.
But here you are on shore-
But now you have to work or starve,
Your father’s cash is done,
Your generous wife has set you free,
A divorce number one;
Rise up and take your father’s place,
Your spirit mother’s near;
You have to undo all the wrong,
Before your pain will clear.
You are a lazy, wicked drone,
That ought to be a heap of bone,
You d better undo all the wrong,
Or else God’s self-accusing thong
Will fill your joints with ache and pain,
And turn your alcoholic brain
Into a mass of jim-jam life,
The essence of all mortal strife.
THE JEWISH NEW YEAR.
• At sunset to-day (October 4th, 1910), time of writ-
mgr, the Jewish New Year (5671) , will be heralded in
every synagogue throughout the world by the weird
beT.n 6 °l the shofar < ram ’ s hor/) and will
be res p onded to by many millions of the Jewish race
The festival, which is observed with all the sym


holism which characterises Jewish ceremonial, ex-
tends over a period of ten days, although the first
and last days only are those which are publicly ob-
served. A partial fast obtains during the whole time,
but for the twenty-four hours which constitute the
last day, the great and dread day of atonement, a
strict fast is kept in regard to food and drink. Un
this day the ministers wear flowing white robes,
symbolical of funeral shrouds, and every good Jew
closes his place of business, in order to give him-
self entirely to the day’s devotion.
RELIGION AND ITS USE.
Religion in its varied forms,
Is always doing good,
It annals every kind of thought,
In stained glass, stone, or wood,
It decorates our cities,
With its elevated mind,
It makes a florine world of thought,
To elevate mankind.
Religion is a sacred thought,
Stored in the human breast,
That peers into the future life.
Where everything is blest,
By God, Who has created man
To improve system’s growth,
By elevating mind and flesh,
From ignorance and sloth.
Religious thought and duty,
Is framed in heaven above,
To make a world of happiness,
For all progressive, love,
And all we want is thrift and will,
To take from mother earth,
The things we want to make us grand,
Turn to and show your worth.
Religion shows the human race",
Each wicked deed in life,
Is printed on the mental chart,
Of boy, girl, man, and wife,
This is the flame of torture,
That the prophets saw of old,
Try and shun this horrid fate,
Outside the heavenly fold.
THE SOUNDING OF THE SHOFAR.
The sounding of the shofar is one of the most im-
portant, and not the least inspiring items, in the
celebration of the Rosh Hashona, as the New Year
festival is called. The shofar is a ram s horn of
various shapes and sizes, and _it only emits very
primitive sounds. By reason of its elongated mouth,


it is very difficult to perform on this instrument, and
the cantor seldom being equal to the labour, a spe-
cial official known by the name of “Baal Tokeiah”
(master of the sounding) is engaged for the occa-
sion. Ihe notation of the shofar consists of a few
ear-piercing sounds, which have to be blown in a
C u f^r) iri or<^er » chanted by the cantor. According to
the Prophet Amos, none can hear the trumpet sound-
ed on New Year’s Day without feelings of fear. Tra-
dition, which plays so large a part in Jewish cere-
monial, has it that it was on this day that Abraham
offered up a ram as a sacrifice instead of Isaac, on
Mount Moriah.
THE SHOFAR TRUMP.
When Amos sounds the shofar trump,
The Jews from far and near,
Will rally round the Union Jack,
To banish dread and fear,
While they pass round the apple sliced
In honey bright and clear,
Then each will eat and pray that God
Will give a sweet New Year.
Then all the Jews, both young and old,
Upon Britannia’s shore,
Will cast bread tokens on the deep,
And swear they’ll sin no more;
Without the fear of bigots’ wrath,
The Jews will cry aloud,
Victoria’s heirs have David’s right,
This makes us all feel proud.
The shofar marks the Jewish time,
As years keep rolling by,
it makes them think of what has passed,
With its historic cry;
It links faith, hope, and duty
With the British Islem race,
The Jewish blood redeemed the world,
From all its sad disgrace.
Ihe shofar shows the prophet’s rights
Are with the Jews to-day,
And the time is not far distant,
When they will lead the way;
They have the gold and wisdom,
And their morals are sublime,
Ihey are God’s chosen people,
Who will stop war, want, and crime.
(This proves the “Rosh Hashona” is the keystone,
and proof that the British Empire is the greatest in
the world.)


Mount Moriah has its sacred spot,
Where Abraham was seen,
Just going to offer up his son,
A lad not quite sixteen,
The old man cried in plaintive tones.
Oh, God, I’ll give Thee all,
There’s nothing here to sacrifice,
My son shall meet this call.
Just then a frantic ram rushed up,
Got tangled in a bush,
The old man killed the ram instead,
And burnt it on dry brush;
God’s angels watched this tragic scene,
And noted every thought,
They brought the ram to sacrifice,
This miracle was wrought.
This way God tried this great man’s fate,
Was honest to the core,
These angels sang, Your seed is blessed
This day for evermore;
Your faith shall be the starting point,
For all religious mind,
The Union Jack shall keep it free,
To uplift all mankind.
You are the father of the race,
Whose duty is to prove,
The sacrifice of flesh and blood,
Is system on the move;
It feeds and clothes progressive life,
Let wisdom be your guide,
Your honour, faith, and sacrifice,
Should be your children’s pride,
WHAT GOD DID.
God made King David strong and bold,
Who laid Goliath dead and cold,
Then with his sword cut off his head,
At this his foemen turned and fled,
And if the same thing does occur,
King David’s heirs will make a stir,
The shofar with traditional sound,
Will say Jehovah’s on the ground.


Then Gideon with his spirit band,
Will soar forth with their trumps in hand,
And fill each heart with dread and fear,
When he proclaims the dreaded year,
Then Christ with all His angel host,
With glasses filled will drink this toast,
Sloth, war, and sin must disappear,
Before peace, thrift, goodwill, and cheer.
Then all the earth will start to quake,
The waters they will foam and shake,
Electric belts will rent the air,
’Mid great confusion and despair,
Then in tremendous hail and rain,
These armies all will writhe in pain,
And curse the day they went to fight,
With David’s heirs and Islem’s might.
When all this wicked strife is o’er,
The earth will soak up all its gore,
But in the plague and fever maze,
All bigot mind will cease to craze,
Then God will send a mighty flood,
To cover up their flesh and blood,
This will manure fruit, roots, and grain,
To feed the new Jerusalem brain.
OUR DUTY.
Queen Victoria’s proclamation
Says we are the Islem world,
And our triune dispensation
Is the Union Jack unfurled,
Have nourished thrift and duty
With our chivalry and love
Into a sacred treaty
With the Great I Am above.
Chorus —
With the Great I Am above,
With the Great I Am above,
We will never break this treaty
With the Great I Am above.
And St. Patrick from the steeple
Says that all the British race
Must go forward as one people
And they’ll never meet disgrace;
We are the sons of freedom,
That the Scriptures have foretold;
We must rule the earth with wisdom
From the Great Eternal Fold,


Chorus—
From the Great Eternal Fold,
From the Great Eternal Fold,
We will rule the earth with wisdom
From the Great Eternal Fold.
All Ben Lomond spirit songsters,
Sings the parents of our time,
Must teach all their sons and daughters
To court wisdom and shun crime,
For science and invention
Is the twentieth century plan,
To evolve constitution
With the Engineering Man.
Chorus—
With the Engineering Man,
With the Engineering Man,
We will evolve constitution
With the Engineering Man.
The Tolling of the Bells.
Britannia’s bells are chiming,
We crowned him George the Fifth,
Our armies are all singing,
He is no national myth;
Peace, goodwill, and liberty
Is round his sacred throne,
With honour, thrift, and duty
From all the British zone.
Our federal bells are tolling,
The time is close at hand,
Christ Jesus He is coming
With all His spirit band,
To welcome George the Mighty,
King Edward’s second son,
Upon the throne of duty,
Where all great work is done.
Our factory bells are ringing,
The time is very near,
When we must don the' bunting,
The old folks used to wear;
Our fathers were inventors,
And heroes, too, combined,
But we are all defenders
Of fame they left behind.


God grant our federal army
Are gallant, wise, and brave,
Let’s win more wealth and glory,
Brittania rules the wave;
Let muscle, mind, and sinew
Be our redeeming plan,
And God will say continue
To evolve beast and man-
We All Should Work.
(To the music of “Gospel Bells.’’)
King George the Fifth went forth and saw
The earth and all its zones,
He studied every social law
For utilising drones,
That’s always making woe and strife
For those who work and toil
To win the comforts of all life
From good old nature’s spoil.
Our King declares that all should work
To produce joy and thrift,
And those who only live to shirk
Will surely have to shift
Uut of Britannia’s sacred belt,
Where each one takes their part
To produce every joy that’s felt
With human mind and heart.
Now boys and girls stop out so late,
And use such funny slang,
That no one wonders at their fate,
And all its bitter twang;
Late hours with their immoral paint
Will smudge the scroll of fame
With every kind of wicked taint
That fills our land with shame.
Late hours will put the hectic spot
Upon the maiden’s cheeks,
And cultivate a drunken lot
Of dissipated freaks;
They manufacture drones and thieves
Of every grade and kind
That’s annaled on their record leaves
That jogs the criminal’s mind.


AN ODE FROM THE BUND TO THE
PEOPLE.
Oh God of light and beauty,
And great ruler of all fate,
Pour out Thy generous blessings
Upon our helpless state;
We are blind, but strong and willing;
We are not born to beg,
So give us work that we can do,
And we will be no dreg.
Kind friends, picture human blindness,
Without a ray of light,
And listening to your busy world,
Oh, how we long for sight—
To see God’s living grandeur,
For we know it’s all around;
We smell the flowers, hear the birds—
Oh, what a joyful sound.
Then, oh, what a sad affliction—
Blind, sitting on a stool,
And begging from a public,
Some so callous, cold, and cruel,
Some taunt and try your patience,
Only just to have a lark;
You swear an oath and shy your stick
But never hit the mark.
Someone who never sees the cause
Will cry, “You wicked man,
You go to gaol or pay the fine,”
Oh, what a heartless plan;
Why don’t these people stop and think
Before they start to throw
The stone that same day may recoil
To smite their own blind show.
Now this extra pain’s not needed,
Why aren’t we just and kind?
We ought to help the aged and sick,
And all the helpless blind;
Now, let’s be united, friends,
In this great human call,
For means to help the needy blind
To earn their future haul.


By selling to the public
Uur trade and factories' skill
With this commercial lever, friend,
We’ll help turn nature’s mill;
God crown the blind men’s institute,
Close to Cathedral Square,
With God’s wisdom, love, and plenty,
For all who need , its care.
God grant that those who help the blind
With gracious gift or deed
Live long without an ache or pain
To help their future need;
And may they all shine with glory
So bright that all in town
May see faith, hope, and charity
Imprinted on their gown.
God grant their golden harvest
Is enough to meet each call
Upon the motto of their lives,
With love and help for all,
By making blind men happy homes
In every country place,
To advertise the wares and skill
Of all the British race.
Our institute could rule them all—
Oh! what a noble work;
Make no mistake, we’re clever men,
And duty will not shirk;
The world can trust our honesty,
We cannot see to cheat;
This scheme will work—give it a trial—
God urges me to treat.
for our blind commercial agents
In every town and place
To build up advertising homes
For all our modern race;
To print upon the sands of time
Australia means to live
To be a noble empire grand,
With her motto, “Live to give.”
This motto means promotion, friends,
For all the thrifty blind,
They could sell all the surplus stock
Of every kindred kind;
They could advance the nation
With their wise commercial tact,
To be a guiding star to all,
And proving this great fact,


That everything in nature’s plan
Has got its proper place,
When marshalled by your knowledge,
It improves the human race;
By helping one another
To improve kind nature’s gift,
To stimulate the empire with
Uur sowing seeds of thrift.
For every grade of human life
To take from nature’s growth
All their family wants and comforts,
To banish pain and wrath;
Fancy, hear Sir Alfred speak,
From his memorial tower,
Saying, “Kind friends, I love the blind,
They use my spirit power.”
Go forth and be a Daniel brave,
In this great Christian call,
Go help the blind to help themselves,
The grandest work of all;
Kind friends, the blind all need your help
To earn their daily bread,
So by their wisdom, wares, and skill,
Street poverty they dread-
And the God of light and beauty
Will favour every gift
With ten times its sole gross value
In your next season’s thrift;
Be kind and generous-hearted
To all who cannot see,
Old nature’s living grandeur,
Oh! how awful it must be.
ihe angels’ proclamation
The Angels’ Proclamation.
Is to all the British race,
Go forward as one nation,
And you’ll never know disgrace;
You are the sons of freedom,
That the Scriptures have foretold,
Should rule the earth with wisdom,
From the Great Eternal Fold.
Chorus —
From the Great Eternal Fold,
From the Great Eternal Fold,
We will rule the earth with wisdom,
From the Great Eternal Fold.


The angels’ proclamation
Says we are the Islem world,
Our triune dispensation
Is the “Union Jack” unfurled;
We’ll nourish thrift and duty
With our chivalry and love,
This is a sacred duty
With our God in heaven above.
Chorus —
With our God in heaven above,
With our God in heaven above,
We will never break this treaty
With our God in heaven above.
And all the angel songsters
Sing, the parents of our time,
Must teach their sons and daughters
To court wisdom, and shun crime,
For science and invention
Is the twentieth century plan,
To remove apprehension
With an Engineering Man.
Chorus —
With an Engineering Man,
With an Engineering Man,
We’ll remove apprehension
With this Engineering Man.
KING DREADNOUGHT.
(British Patriotic Song.)
The King of Peace is living,
A mighty power is he,
He fears no living monster,
On either land or sea;
He has his dreadnought armour,
Behind it all are free
To think, work, and multiply
His land with sterling glee.
Chorus—
Singing Rule Britannia,
Britannia rules the waves,
Britons never, never, never
Shall be slaves.


He sails out with the fearless,
King Edward is his name,
He means to be with victory,
A d powerful in each game;
From Britain’s dreadnought armour
Will come the deadly hale,
To smash the man or country
That treads upon his tail.
Chorus as before.
Britannia she is watching
Her cubs close by her side,
Her dreadnought claws and golden teeth
Rules the rolling tide;
The King of Peace is sorry
That this should ever be;
Dreadnought means be always strong,
To fight and make all free.
Chorus as before.
Freedom For All Nations.
(March Tune, “Rule Britannia.”)
The freedom of all people
Is what we must maintain,
So let us be united,
And all for Federal gain;
We want religious* freedom,
With due respect to all;
This would make us trusting friends
In every needful call.
Creedal strife and bigot hate,
Invented keen, bright swords,
To cut and slash human flesh,
To fill asylum wards;
Why try to make our neighbours
Believe the same as us
About their soul after death—
All this is useless fuss.
To me this is a system
That irritates the brain,
To take away our freedom,
And all for personal gain;
The motto of all people
Should be “Good will to all”;
This would unite all kindreds,
And elevate the soul-


Let’s down all creedal dogmas,
And teach the human mind
To foster love and wisdom;
This would improve mankind;
Creedal hate has cursed the world,
And never tries to sow
Seeds of knowledge in the mind.
That God foretold should grow.




THE
POET'S
DREAM
OR
THE ANGELS' PROCLAMATION
TO THE BRITISH EMPIRE.
BY
ALFRED WATTS
th e
Blind Australian
Poet.


Reconciliation, Welcome and Greeting to
SIR GEORGE REID
By the Universal Labor and Democratic Leagues of Aus-
tralia when he returns to his adopted home. The same
is meant for his Wife and Family to enjoy to the utmost
and the author sincerely hopes that the public of Aus-
tralia will take steps to do what this poem suggests
Poetical Greeting to Sir George Reid and his wife anu
family, hoping they will return in good health to re-
ceive it.
Australia’s full of songsters
Of every sort and kind,
Composing lyric mixtures
For the body, soul, and mind,
To rally round our standard
. In the great millenium fight,
Where all that never faltered
Will have domineering might.
When J. C. Watson took the reins
From George Reid’s sterling hand,
He showed the world he had the brains
To lead his sturdy band
Out of the mire of discontent,
Where tradesmen should not dwell,
To fan the fire of sad ferment
That makes this world a hell.
Let statesmen improve ways and means,
And lighten each man’s pack ;
Make all that eat the toilers beans,
Turn out and do their whack.
Wh en George Reid joined this worthy rank
He put the women’s rights
Upon his democratic plank.
And now they rule with might.
Now labor, with its sacred light
Should hold the key and cue
That regulates the selfish rite
To bid Id up systems new ;
Aspiring mind will surely bridge
The chasm in its way.
“Joe Cook,’’ he climbed the golden ridge,
His sovereigns shine to-day.
When Sir George Reid comes back again
We’ll give him such a cheer;
Our buntings will be on, the main.
For him w r e love so dear.'
Our ladies will be fine and neat - •
To greet their franchise king
His wife will cry! This is'a treat ~
To hear your children sing.


PATRIOTIC SONG.
Australia’s National Anthem
It’s framed in heaven above,
To quell the fierce millenium
With its wise, discretive love.
There, all the British nation
With her triune flags unfurled,
Will reform constitution
In the New Jerusalem World.
Australia is in motion;
She has made a noble start,
Since Sir George Reid’s promotion
Every man has played his part,
Like men of ancient story,
Inspired from heaven above,
To improve national duty
With wisdom, thrift, and love.
We are the Federal Nation
God has planted in the South;
When moved to desperation
We have got the lion’s mouth,
For “Andy Fisher’s’’ army
Will protect Australia’s shore
Fiom everything that’s shoddy,
Like our fathers did before.
Propelling Toung Australia
With our scientific might,
All shouting “Buie, Britannia,”
We are foremost in the fight.
With “Billy Hughes’ ” navy
That’s so gallant, fast, and strong,
That all our father’s glory
Will repeat itself in song.
With Queen Victoria’s charter
We have made this Southern isle
Produce the means for barter
That made all Europe smile.
And now we are a union
That was never seen before,
And mean to lead creation
To the peaceful evermore.
Chorus :
We’re marching on to glory,
With all our modern lore,
Improving gallant story,
Like our fathers did before.
