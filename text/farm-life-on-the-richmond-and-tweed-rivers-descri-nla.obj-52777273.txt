INTRODUCTORY.
f T is my intention that this work be one of reference, giving-
information as to size of farms, grasses used, crops grown,
grades of cattle, situation, rainfall, soil, and that general
knowledge which will enable people at a glance to under-
stand that with so many acres of land, with such a class of
•cow and sire, and on certain pastures as described, dairying can be
and has been, made a great success. If this enables the man in
search of high-class dairy farming country to satisfy his quest,
•or if it enlightens the farmer in less favoured districts, and
induces him to adopt some of the within-mentioned successes to
his own advantage, and to the benefit of those surrounding him,
I will consider my humble effort not in vain.
FRANK RUSSELL.
Names that will, and are justified, to stand in the forefront
•of those known throughout the dairylands of the world, are the
Richmond and Tweed Rivers of New South Wales, AUSTRA-
LIA, highly adapted by climate and soil to grow in abundance
:all the necessary requirements of the milk producer. Nothing
more is necessary than a larger population of that class of men
who to-day are making the North Coastal Rivers of New South
Wales famous for the quantity and quality of their butter. Corn-

Making up a set of Cases.
■paratively speaking but a few years ago this large area of country,
then in its native grandeur of magnificent, luxuriant, sub-tropical
undergrowth and towering, majestic timbers, offered attractions
to but few of the more enterprising cedar-getters, whose early
.adventures over rugged hill-side and fern-clad torrents, helped
in no small degree to herald to the outside world the existence of
■what to-day can be justly termed God’s Dairy Land.” After the
timber-getter, whose thirst for cedar was just as acute as the
•miner’s thirst for gold was then in its incompleted stage, came
the men whose star of Providence directed them to go northward,
.and with them began the early settlement, with all its privations
and disappointments. Some went in for cattle-rearing, others for
•cane-growing, and, thereby enlightened, others followed. Small
sugar mills started, but with little success till at last the great
Colonial Sugar Refining Company came along and improved the
■conditions ; and so progressed the cane industry, which even to-day
plays an important part in the development of the Richmond and
Tweed, largely assisted by the splendid service of steamers placed
.at the Rivers’ disposal by the North Coast Steam Navigation
Company. Consequently now we no longer find the great stand-
ing scrub, but in lieu thereof lovely undulating country, mostly
cleared and grassed with those fine milk-producing substances
that this soil has proved its special aptitude to grow; such as the
•celebrated grass Paspalum dilatatum, Prairie, Rye, Cocksfoot,

Trucking the Cases from the Refrigerator to the Hatch.
Lambs’ Tongue, Couch and Clover. With a rainfall of over fifty
inches a year, the mildest winters of short duration, the many
hundreds of rivulets and never-failing springs, which culminate
in the grand expanse of waters known as the Richmond and
Tweed Rivers, up which the ocean boats wend their way into
the heart of these great districts, it becomes no wonder that this
should be so ideal a dairyland, and one can understand the rapid
progress the whole country is making. Immense sums of money
have been spent by the various Governments in providing roads
and placing a railway (an important adjunct to the progress of
the place) at the disposal of the dairymen. The railway now runs
from the Clarence River through the principal towns of the
Richmond, Casino, and Lismore; thence forward past the great
butter factory of Byron Bay on to Murwillumbah, the chief
centre of the Tweed River. Again great items in the district’s
development are the butter factories. First amongst them, and
far ahead of anything of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere,
is the North Coast Co-operative Butter Co., Ltd., at Byron Bay,
with large branches at Lismore and Murwillumbah, turning out
butter to the value of £400,000 per annum. The other important
factories consist of Lismore Co-operative Butter Factory, also
the Alstonville, Ballina, Brooklet, Casino, Kyogle, Coraki, and
Woodburn factories. A description of the two former companies
will be found within these pages. Six Agricultural Societies
cater for the maintaining of the highest standard of stock, they
are the Eangalow, Alstonville, Lismore, Casino, Coraki, and
Murwillumbah. The first two, celebrated throughout the State

for their magnificent display of dairy stock, offer some informa-
tion in a separate part of this book as to the progress of their
respective districts, coupled with their own advance, which has
Teen truly remarkable when viewed in the face of so many other
societies existing in the same localities. In outlying parts of the
country, where the timber is still remaining, a very large business
is being carried on, upwards of twenty-five mills working in this
district, and still local demands in many parts remain ill-supplied.
A further progressive move is the shipping of some of the more
'beautiful scrub timbers to Europe and America, notably Beech,
Teak, Rosewood, and Bean. Besides sugarcane, many other
things are grown—maize, planter’s friend, millet, arrowroot,
potatoes, bananas, pine apples and all sub-tropical fruits and
vegetables. The whole country is now a series of centres, most
■of which have its own school, churches, stores, &c. Almost
every farm in the entire district (in which there are considerably
over two thousand registered dairies) is amply catered for by
Butcher, Baker, and Storekeeper; and scores of suitable waggons
remove from each farm its cream to the nearest Railway Station
or Factory, thereby enabling dairymen to devote the whole of
their time and energy to attending to their stock and farms. Few
countries in the world could have finer facilities offered them,
especially when there is taken into consideration the fine fleet
of steamers at the disposal of the residents of this corner of the
North-east of New South Wales. The chief towns on these
Rivers consist of Lismore, Casino, Ballina, Coraki, and Murwil-
lumbah, each with its municipal council and telephone service;
the three former with a fine water supply laid on. Lfismore, with
its gas, septic tank, underground sewerage, steam stone crushing
plant, road making machine, and asphalt works, constitutes one
■of the most prosperous and up-to-date towns in the Australian
Commonwealth. Other chief centres on the Richmond and
Tweed are;—Wardell, Broadwater, Woodburn, Swan Bay, Bun-
.gawalbyn, Myrtle Creek, Ellangowan, Tatham, Kyogle, Wyan-
garie, Eltham, Bangalow, Byron Bay, Mullumbiraby, Myocum,
Billinudgel, Brunswick, Burringbar, Dunbible, Cowlong, Tweed
Heads, Terranora, Newrybar, Tintenbar, Pearce’s Creek, Boo-
yong, Condong, Alstonville, Rous, Wyrallah, Wollongbar, Gool-
mangar, Terrania, Disputed Plains, Hanging Rock, Dunoon,
Corndale, Rosebank, Federal, Eureka, Climes, Springvale, and
other places. A rapidly increasing population now stands at over
40.000, and the number of dairy cattle in the above district at
100.000, from whom three-quarters of a million pounds worth
of butter is made annually, and that portion of which is exported
being - scientifically handled by the Royal Mail Pacific Company,
and Dalgety and Co., through whose kind interest in this work I
am enabled to reproduce some fine pictures in the introductory
pages, specially taken for the purpose by them, enabling the

to the pictures of this introduction is supplied by the North
Coast Steam Navigation Co., from whose soil analysis of the
Richmond and Tweed Rivers the following is taken:—
“The soil on the Tweed River is well supplied with humus
and nitrogenous material, and of very high water-retaining power,
the addition of lime is all that is required to make it highly pro-

Capacity for water, 52 per cent'.; organic matter (humus), r 6

acid, 0.30 per cent.; nitrogen, 0.30 per cent; reaction neutral to

HE HERALD has been
established over 20 years,
was founded by the present
proprietor, and has been
successfully conducted by him
ever since. Many Sydney and
other firms have been con-
tinuous advertisers for 20
years, thus proving the value
of the HERALD as an adver-
tising medium.
Coraki is situated at the
head of the main Richmond
River, one branch junctioning
to Lismore, and the other to
Casino, from Coraki. Casino,
Kyogle, Upper Richmond,
Uralie and Tenterfield goods
are transhipped here from
almost a daily ocean boat
service with Sydney, and a
weekly service with Brisbane,
and Coraki is the most im-
portant shipping port on the
North Coast.
If you want to reach the people of the progressive
RICHMOND RIVER, advertise in the RICHMOND RIVER
HERALD; admitted to be one of the best Country Nev/spapers
in the Commonwealth.

■ humus content (ofter over 20 per cent.) are a high percentage
of nitrogen, and a high capacity for absorbing and retaining
water. This latter property is in the highest degree indicative
of fertility, soils of this nature being open, readily worked, and
favourable to the development of nitrification. The soils examined
from this neighbourhood are all exceedingly active, and produce
nitrates abundantly. They are also better able to resist dry spells
than soils deficient in humus and with a low capacity for retain-
ing water, as the surface evaporation is reduced to a minimum.”
Three trips to this district have lately been organised by the
Tourist Bureau of the Intelligence Department of the State, and
these have been largely instrumental in revealing to a large num-

ber of Sydney residents the great scenic charms and vast agricul-
tural and industrial possibilities of this fertile part of the North
Coast, and in inducing many to invest capital in land there, and to
settle their sons on the soil under such highly-favoured conditions
as obtain in the part of New South Wales now under review.
And now, in concluding, let me leave my subject by saying
to the artist in search of a picture, the poet a theme, the tourist
a field, the tired man a holiday, the angler some sport, the sports-
man some game, the mountaineer some climbing, or the business
man some knowledge, “ Visit the dairyland of the Australian

MANY years ago, seeing the necessity for improved Farm and Station Cutlery
and Instruments, Mr. Bakvk set to work, after very mature consideration,
to evolve designs of the simplest nature, compatible with usefulness, find now,
in a very line and interesting Catalogue (which he has just Copyrighted through-
out the British possessions), he places before the public, in clear cut < prints, with
prices marked in plain figures, a comprehensive selection from his great and
varied stock. This Catalogue is so interesting that we advise our readers to send
their .address to Mr. Bakkr, when a copy will be promptly and cheerfully sent.
The magnificent window and showcase display makes his shop hi Hunter
Street one of the most interesting places to visit, especially to the Station Owner
or Parmer, for here he will he courteously shewn items of special interest,
ranging from the fine steel blade sixpenny skeleton-handle knife to the elaborate

THIS farm was part of what was
once known as the “ Big Scrub” of
the Richmond River, and although at
the present time the whole country-
side is denuded of its once handsome
foliage, it is still familiarly known
by its old name, “The Big Scrub.”
Strange to say, though but a short
time has elapsed since it stood in its
virgin grandeur, from here to the sea-
board is now a series of magnifi-
cent dairy farms, free from scrub of
any kind, and hundreds of thousands
of acres in extent of rich undulating
country, watered by scores of lovely
streams, interspersed with hills and
waving fields and valleys. Paspalum
dilatatum, prairie, rye, cocksfoot,
couch and clover grasses arc grown;
also heavy crops of corn, planter, oats,
and other favourite fodder. The coun-
try side is studded with comfortable
homes, and has grazing on it many
thousands of cattle. This farm is one
of the many, and was originally selec-
ted by the father, Mr, R. Y. Arthur,
and comprises 180 acres, on which is
milked principally the Durham-Ayr-
shire and Durham-Jersey cross, the

whole of the mutton provisions necessary for the population of
this big district. Besides opening up a new industry that will
thrive and do well on account of the wonderful carrying capacity
of the country, it will also be the means of attracting a good class
of men to the Rivers who, at present, are unknown there—namely,
the sheep farmer. Though early yet to prove what number of
sheep it will carry to the acre, one could safely say from six to
eight, though for a period of the year, in special localities, it would
probably double that estimate.
latter, in their opinion, giving rather better results. Although up
to the present looked upon as only a dairying country, Mr. H.
E. Arthur is experimenting with sheep of the Romney Marsh
breed, and they thrive magnificently, neither footrot nor fluke
being apparent; ewes, from eight months, clip to 10 lbs,; rams,
t 8 months old, year clip to 16 lbs.; lambs, SJ/2$ J / 2 months old, dress-

future we can avoid the incongruity of sending abroad for the

THE fine homestead of “ Bonaby” is situated by
the roadside leading from Corndale to Glen
View, and is fourteen miles from Lismore, eight
miles from Bexhill Railway Station, and one and
a quarter mile from Glen View Post Office. The
property is replete with all outbuildings required
for the working .of the farm, and is heavily
grassed with Paspalum, couch, and clover, also
well- watered and fenced. It is four hundred
acres in extent, and is divided into four farms,
three of them worked by Mr. Arthur’s sons, and
one by a tenant. Amongst the first men to per-

The results obtained proved a great financial success, the wonderful milk-producing qualities of the grass becoming at once
apparent, thus causing such a great demand for first-class seed, that Mr. Arthur was unable to meet it, although his land was
highly suitable for a very heavy growth, and produced magnificent yields.

after following up that and cane-growing for a considerable period, he decided on dairying as his future work, and having a

place where more will be heard of concerning the large dairying interest he has on the River. Here we see a property of no less

dance of Paspalnm, that we discover the splendid type of young cattle he is rearing. Few know of their whereabouts, few
conceive their quality; bred from the pick of the herd, sired by the best, beautifully sheltered, everlastingly supplied with springs
from the hillsides, and bedded in grass their own height, it is but reasonable to think they must show as the best. This
property, though at present thought a little back, will, in a vear or two, stand out as one of the ideal farms of our State, and
tend to clearly demonstrate the foresight and energy displayed by the owner; as few men, situated as he was, would have under-
gone the labour of opening up new country, preferring rather to spend their time in supervising or maintaining the lesser work
already done. But “ labour has its own reward,” and in this respect it requires no prophet to foresee this will be no exception
to that rule.

INTERESTING to follow are the particulars of this herd, which was started at Liverpool in June, 1886, by the purchase of
twenty-three head of picked cows, principally grade Ayrshires. and a pure Ayrshire bull. The milk from the herd at that time
was sent by rail to the Country Milk Company, Sydney. In 1890 the herd was moved to “ Oran Park,” near Camden, where
another thirty-two head of grade and pure Ayrshires were added. Supplying the Sydney milk companies was still carried
on from this farm until 1895, when a separator was purchased, and the cream sent to Camden Park Butter Factory. In 1897
the herd, then of 140 head, was moved to Blakcbrook, near Lismore, and from there was again moved, in 1901, to Wollongbar,
Richmond River, where it now
is. The herd at the present time
consists of 100 head of pure
and high-grade Ayrshires,, the
latter being* preferred for the

pure pedigree Berkshire pigs, the progeny of which find ready

Brothers on to the Richmond River, with their fine types of
Ayrshire cattle, a lot of attention has been given to that particular
strain, with the result that some very attractive fields of Ayrshire
cows and bulls have been presented at many of the local shows,

AMONGST the first properties selected here was the above, then a grand dense cedar scrub, taken up by Mr. Perry (now the
Hon. John Perry), who came to the rivers with the intention of settling in the sugar industry, of which but little was
then known. His first attempt at sugar-making was with the use of a wringer and wash-tub, which, when full of juice,
was left out in the sun to granulate, with such success as may be imagined. His after efforts were storekeeping and building
contractor, his principal effort being the Ballina Lighthouse. Sugar-cane growing was gone in for largely, but getting into
Parliamentary harness, he even-
tually handed the property over
to his son, Mr. J. A. Perry, who
for twelve years was a sugar-
grower, and he developed it into
one of the finest dairy farms on
the rivers, containing 370 acres of
magnificent butter country, and
at the time the particulars of this
sketch were taken he was en-
gaged in building up a' splendid
example of a fine dairy herd.
One of his moves was the pur-
chase of 366 head of mixed dairy
sorts from the South Coast, an-
other the securing of ten pedi-
gree cows from Victoria and
New Zealand, and a further
marked move was the bringing

The red flag store
forms a handsome building,
that not only makes a
valuable site for the business, but
will make a good advt. for Lismore,
and make what is undoubtedly ihe
most handsome building in the
town. The cost completed is about and gives a door space of some 22,000 feet, or about a quarter of an acre. The
building stands on a space with a 65 feet frontage to Moles worth Street, and having a depth of 165 feet running buck to a lane, and
while following none of the regular models is of a most modern design, and built specially to suit the class of business done.
The front of the shop in themselves form an attraction that must draw attention. The pavement is of modern design set out in
grey relieved with red bands, and showing the name Red Flag. The windows are full size of the building, of the best British
plate-glass 3/« of an inch thick, with corner pillars and nickel-plated steel, while the whole shop front is edged with marble. The
standing pillars inside are of nickel, as are the liars, and the space provided is ample for a good display of stock, equalling in
size many a cottage bedroom. Entrance is by three handsome swing doors fitted with bevelled, mirrors of British plate-glass,
the pavement of entry through this being of mosaic tiles with the names “ Red Flag ” and Mr. Robertson’s initials (A.G.R.)
worked out in the pattern. The building is very solidly built.
The Lismore Co=Operative Dairy Co.’s Butter Factory
SOUTH LISMORE.
THIS was the first central Butter Factory in the North Coast District, and was the work of the New South Wales Creamery
Coy. It represents a fine effort in the early days of butter making. Things appertaining to the dairying industry in those times
were not as they are now —it was the budding time, bidding fair for a free expansion, and it blossomed and grew, marking an
important epoch in the progress of the times; and though it changed hands in 1904, it still remains a handsome monument
to the movement. It was in that year taken over by the Lismore Co-operative Dairy Coy., which has done splendid work in the
manufacture, export, and sale of butter. Its financial position is exceptionally good, and it always pays its suppliers on the highest
scale. As the fine picture depicts, it is a splendid structure, and veiy beautifully situated on the bank of the Richmond
River, close to Lismore, and has its own wharf, where all ocean-going boats call. It is well fitted with necessary machinery for
manufacturing first-class, butter.

the largest exhibitor, but a highly suc-

The popularity of the name - is aug-

big prices for the best cows procurable, and mating them with
suitable sires. He has passed the standard and entered into the
Butter Test Herd Book no less than 52 cows, 30 of them during
the year 1904 alone. Then again, in the milking Shorthorn Herd
Book, he has had passed in by the judges 19 cows and two
bulls, and is also the breeder of “ Kelso” and “ Perfection,”
whose pictures appear in these pages. Of course, it is but fair
to point out that Mr. Cooke has had many years of experience

ASSOCIATED from early boyhood with the dairying industry in Illawarra, and living there for man)’ years, they acquired a
knowledge which in recent years has stamped them as amongst the most successful dairy cattle men on the Rivers,
They came to the Richmond in 1898, and taking a lease of “ Eanreldalc,” they commenced work in real earnest, and during
the following five vears made record progress, rapidly rising to the forefront of dairying. They brought from (lie South Coast a
very fine herd of cattle, consisting of some 50 head of milkers and 150 head of young stock from 15 to 24 months old, picked
from the herds of Daniel Boyd. T. R. Moffitt, James Bros., and Id. Chittick. Included in the lot brought up was a very good

A number of these cattle became great prize-winners, and rapidly made the name of Johnstone Bros, noted. Later on they became
possessed of “Duke,” bringing him from Milton (where he was a noted prize-winner), and in this way laid the foundation
of their fine herd, which has been universally admitted to rank as one of the best dairy herds in the State, affording facilities
to those in search of high-class grade heifers, or tip-top young dairy hulls. The excellent results gained by this hard-working,
practical family is shown as follows;—During the year 1902 they took for cream alone £1172, this Vicing from 100 cows, or an

the best possible butter results from any farm in the district. It is noteworthy that the actual returns for the year 1902, from
all sources, were over £1,400 —surely the finest evidence of the ability and knowledge of the men in the business they had
embarked in. With considerable foresight they purchased a splendid piece of country on either side of the railway line at
Booyong, consisting of 475 acres, the whole of which they had cleared and grassed with prairie, cocksfoot, lambs’ tongue,
couch, clover, and Paspalum, within two years. They also bought a magnificent farm adjoining, consisting of 100 acres of
highly-improved country. Their 575 acres of rich, volcanic ridges, and still richer alluvial flats being capable of growing all the grass

and green stuff necessary, it is reasonable to presume they will continue in the business of breeding and rearing that type
of high-class young dairy stock for which there is so great a demand. The herds at present consist chiefly of the Illawarra
strain, and include pure-bred Durhams and Durham-Ayrshire cross. Their winnings during the last few years include

Rous, R.R.
SRIVEN and a-half years ago this property was all standing scrub
of tire heaviest nature, but is now cleared and grassed with
Paspalum and a veritable paradise of feed, running 60 milkers for
14 cans of milk, made up as follows:—Ten 10-gallon cans and
four 11-gallon cans daily to the Rous Co-operative Factory ; also
grazing at the same time some 70 head of other stock, a total of
130 head of mixed sorts, which, when the area is mentioned—
namely, too acres-—must he considered a remarkably good result.
The stock consists of fine-class, well-grown grade Durham cows
of the lllawarra strain. Starting with some that were secured
from Mr. Hugh Dudgeon, of Jambaroo, and mated to a Durham
milking hull that was bought from Mr. John Young, the present
results prove the wisdom of the move. Mr. Robins arrived on the
Richmond in 1859, making out to Wooroowoolgen Station for live years, then on to the Rower
Richmond, going into'the timber getting business, afterwards taking to cane growing, which he
followed for 20 years with considerable success, (eventually settling down to the dairying, he is
now working with the profits here indicated. The harm is situated on the Rous to Alstonville

not so many years ago, was covered
with that dense, handsome cloak the
Richmond was once so celebrated for.
Besides this land surrounding the
home, there is another farm of 65
acres, used as a dry run and for pro-
ducing fodder for horses, cattle, and
pigs. The home farm is subdivided

other green fodders for winter feed. A fine soul of grass is everywhere to be seen, and consists only of the choicest kinds, such
as prairie, Paspalum, rye, clover, lambs’ tongue, and cocksfoot.. Bought fourteen years ago, in a very rough state, Mr. Cullen
has made it appear “ a place of beauty and a joy for ever.” Some time back he held a'verv successful clearing out sale by way
of spelling the country for a year or two, his cattle averaging £lO per head. After that, at his leisure, he carefully selected a
number of young stock, which he has now in milk, and some idea of their type may be gathered from the accompanying

THOUGH but a few years on
the Richmond River, he has
already made his presence felt,
owing- to the very fine quality of
the animals that accompany
him to all the principal shows of
the district. Having previously
spent 20 years in the industry, he
has acquired that fine, keen judg-
ment which stands to him in the
selection of the class of sire that
makes his name familiar. He has
carefully experimented with pure
bied Aryshire and milking Durham mated to a lot of first-class Illawarra type cows; the results most satisfactory being
m favour of the latter sires : and in his importation to this district of the fine bull “ Kia ’Ora,” he had undoubtedly chosen
one that was bound to stand in the front line of the picked sires here.
Some of the young stock shown by Mr. Fraser this year at all the leading shows, having created a very high impres-
sion on the minds of all our leading cattle men —beautiful quality, lovely colours—and his still more recent importation from
the South coast a choice lot of young animals, will go one further to keeping him even more favourably in the eye of the
public. Ailonton is a fine, big farm, ten miles from Ifismore, on the main road to Nimbin, with nice commodious buildings

COMING from a locality that has been responsible for producing many keen cattle-men, matured from their infancy in the atmo-
sphere of high-class dairying, tutored in the school of experience, instinctively learning the points that constitute the milker,
conversant with the fodders that make the butter, and destined to play an important educational part in the districts whence they
migrate, it is safe to say that not a small number of our successful dairy farmers hail from the Kiama country, on the South
Coast of New South Wales, in which place the name of Dudgeon is a household word for that which is good amongst dairymen.

his earlier days with the best that the South Coast could supply, and bringing to bear an experience that is recognised as one
of the most practical in the State, he has continuously maintained a magnificent herd of choice cows, a large number of
them being the finest butter producers. It is not to be wondered at that, with such surroundings the son should acquire the
knowledge of the father, and it is clearly evident by practical demonstration that he does possess that judgment which has
made his name as familiar on the Richmond and Tweed Rivers, as his father’s is on the South Coast.

BANGALOW, R.R.
A NATIVE of the South Coast, where from boyhood he had been associated with the cattle industry. After coming to the Rich-
mond in 1895, he followed up with much success the same line. The three cows whose pictures are presented herewith were,
amongst the herd he sold when starling business, they bringing £52 under the hammer. These cows averaged up to 56 lbs. of
milk per 24 hours, off the grass. Having made a thorough success of the dairying and butchering business, he decided, as a
good opening was offering, to start auctioneering, which he did in Nc wry bar and Hangalow, and soon showed his ability to make

successful sales, for, notwithstanding- the strong opposition he has had to contend with, his books show some line records, a
few items of which are worth mentioning. During the last three to four years he has sold, at high-class average, £91,083 worth
of land, and £19,284 worth of stock, establishing some fine record prices—for Mr. C. Bonnell’s whole herd, £l3 10s. 3d.; on account
of Mr. Strong, Rous, 300 acres at £25 per acre cash; and for the “ Garven Estate," block 14, all standing scrub, the fine price
of £ig per acre.
Mr. Wiley claims, from his wide knowledge of the district, to he able to advise intending settlers and show them
some of the finest farms and cattle that are for sale in the district. This he will lie glad to do at any time if communicated with*
all correspondence being assured of prompt attention.

“Bangalow Estate"
Bangalow, R.R.
NO 1 FARM HERD.-160 head all yarded ready to milk
\V.MLX this district was one solid face of big scrub, dense and tall, bold in its solid grandeur, difficult of access through its
intertwined undergrowth, though possessing an attractive soil, and promising rainfall, there came along some 25
years ago, the original .pioneers of this district. Amongst the very first of them was Robert Campbell, the subject of
this matter, who was born on the Hunter, when* for many years he was engaged in smelting tin and copper ores. He found,
himself sutiering with a common ailment at the time (probably for all time), “land hunger," and unable to satisfy that
■appetite in his native place, he came to the Richmond River in ILSI. Corning on to this part he decided 10 investigate the
surrounding country, which at that time was a most difficult matter, the density of the undergrowth and “ lawver vines " (a verv
severe, strong, prickly growth, which grips you very often on both sides, holding on with remarkable tenacity, and requiring
fair knowledge and determination to escape its clutches—evidently some grim humour in the man who named it ) necessi-
tating the use of a brush hook almost every yard you travelled: consequently proving a very slow, tedious job. Finally he
selected on the bank of the beautiful stream now known as Byron Creek the 640 acres of hills and valleys, consti-
tuting the Bungalow Estate, on which the fast-rising township, the railway station, and line show-ground buildings are
elected. Looking at the country around one tries to picture the scene of labour, the swish of the brush hook, the music of
the axe, the crash of the drive, the roar of the fire: then all is silent; one awakens and wonders; the scene is
changed, the enchantress has moved her wand, for behold, where once stood the golden cedar, the silky oak, the scented rose-
wood, the tapering pine and the handsome bean, warmed by the sunshine and refreshed by the shower, now roams the dairy
cow, now grows the food of kings. Such is the change, and we see here, as elsewhere, the embodiment of the phrase,
God s Dairy Land. The whole of this estate of more than eight hundred acres is cleared and deeply grassed with the
various artificial grasses best adapted for producing butter, consisting of Paspalum, prairie, cocksfoot, couch and clover, excel-
lent 1 esults being shown on his butter-sheets from the Byron Bay factory. The estate at present is worked as three separate
dairy farms, accounts being-
kept apart to prove the merits
of each. The soil is of that rich
chocolate class so very highly
thought of for its sugar-cane
and grass producing qualities.
The farm is situated in a fine
position on either side of the
railway station. The township
and homes of a number of resi-
dents are built on the property,

being no actual means of getting- it to market. By this time settlers were beginning to come in and open up countiy in various
directions, and though meetings were scarce and buildings scarcer, it was proposed to form a progress association at Byion Bay.
This was done, the first gathering taking place on the Cooper’s Shoot Road. Still later on came the sugar industry, and Mr.
Campbell started growing cane; also producing a good deal of maize, and so on. Things progressed slowly till the vast re-
sources, climate and soil of the Richmond River became better known, then people came along in numbers in quest of land, and
the place forced some attention from the Government, Mr. Campbell supporting strongly the great claims of the district to con-
sideration at the hands of the Ministry. In the early days, during the inception of the butter factory efforts, he worked with a will
to help it forward by personal canvassing day and night. In the onward movement of the forming of the Bangalow A. and I.
Society, he preferred a very nice piece of land for the use of that body, and so pleased were the committee they have since
purchased the site at £5O per acre. For his continued exertions in connection with that body the committee have elected him a
life member. Representations being made to him as to the necessity for a township, he placed at the disposal of the public
the most central portion of the farm on either side of the railway, had it surveyed and subdivided, and a very large number of people
immediately displayed their confidence in the prospects of the town by eagerly buying up the allotments. In the short space
of two or three years the whole aspect has changed, a thriving business being done in Bangalow, which is backed up by one of
the wealthiest districts in the State, with a future bright with hope. The Government having neglected to reserve any land
for the purpose, Mr. Campbell has given a fine site with sufficient ground for a general cemetery for all religious denominations.

ON either side of the main Lis-

from Murwillumbah to the for-
mer town, is seen this fine pro-
perty (IR3 mile from Bangalow)
generally recognised as one of
the best farms in the district.
Not many years ago, when Mr
Reading first bought this place,
there was a lot of work in front
of him, in clearing, felling, burn-
ing off, grassing, fencing, build-
ing, &c. These have all been
carried out so successfully that
one is delighted with the com-
fortable, finished appearance of
the farm as we see it to-day. The
pretty, roomy homestead, with
its fine entrance through a
rapidly growing plantation of
pines, is most effective, and
shows the early thought and de-
termination to make things com-
fortable and homely. All the
other buildings are in keeping.

from the yards, and occupies an elevated posi-
tion from which the milk gravitates to the calf
pens and pig run. The milk is brought from
the bails by means of a light truck and tram-
way line, entirely dispensing with all handling,
and is quickly and simply treated. The estate
consists of 200 acres of beautiful, undulating
country, and heavily grassed level paddocks,
with the magnificent advantage of no less than
three miles of frontage to the main Byron
Creek, securing a super-abundance of water at
all times and seasons. Mr. Reading has cer-
tainly spared neither time nor money to bring

although not nearly taxed up to its possibilities, its results would open the eyes of many practical men; the idea of working the
farm being to use it as a general base to milk from and rear calves, keeping the farm from undue stocking by placing the
young cattle on outside paddocks.. A keen cattle enthusiast, he has, as may readily be imagined, many splendid types and
grades of cattle, Ayrshire-Durham and milking Durhams; and having this property worked by first-class labour, he is enabled to
give a good deal of his time to forwarding the many interests of the dairying community in this great centre, and has, for
the last two years, filled the important post of President of the Bangalow A. and I. Society.

wonderful productiveness of the Richmond River till one comes
across tests and returns carefully kept. I find the Union Dairy

FARM VIEW.—No 1.
WITH the advance of the district no name is more closely associated than that of Mr. Hayter. He was amongst the
first batch of settlers, his one aim being to carve out a home for himself in this part of the famous “ big
scrub” country, and in that respect he has been particularly successful. He always had a helping hand for
the less prosperous neighbour or the new arrivals. As time passed on he became a big breeder of, and
dealer in, cattle and horses of a very high order. On many farms are to be seen stock purchased from
him, not unfrequently on the most liberal terms; and more than one of the present day prosperous farmers will
gladly attribute his success to the liberal help accorded him by the subject of these lines. An assiduous worker on behalf of his
district, he devotes more time to matters tending to improve the standard of the stock in this part than any other man, his efforts
in placing the Bangalow Agricultural Society on its splendid financial basis being everywhere recognised as remarkable. He
is the owner of several magnificent properties in various parts of the river, the whole of which are devoted to dairying or breeding,
and rearing of that class "of stock which he knows are so well suited to the district’s requirements. He is now handling many
hundreds of choice dairy stock. His fine modern homestead is situated on the main Ballina-Bangalow Road, immediately
adjoining the township of Newrybar, close to Bangalow Railway Station, and convenient to Byron Bay

IRRIGATION.
Showing Sprays at, work at Mr. J. Whitney’s Farm, South Gundarimba.
f 1"' HIS is a question
that the Rich-
mond River
f a rm e r h a s
hitherto taken very
little interest in, owing
to the fact that the
Richmond has been
blessed with a good
rainfall. It has been
considered that irriga-
tion was quite un-
necessary, but the
experience of the last
few years has led
many to turn their
minds to this subject,
and a few of the more
enterprising residents
have experimented on
a small scale.
It seems to be against human nature for one to profit by another’s experience, and Australia is particularly slow in learning
the value of irrigation. There is no lack of object lessons. A visit to California wotdd satisfy even the most prejudiced man as
to the miracles it has wrought in that State. The condition of things in Australia to-day is similar to what it was in California
20 years ago before money was invested there in irrigation. In
.Southern California, for the last io years, the rainfall has not
exceeded an average of 5 to 6 in, per annum, and from that district
now is produced some of the finest fruit that is grown. In a
country as extensive as Australia, the conditions, of course, vary
considerably, and on the Richmond River it would certainly not be
wise to embark on any large irrigation scheme. Hut even in this
well-watered district there are dry spells, as the dairy farmers know
to their cost, and a patch of irrigated land in these times would be a
little goldmine to the dairy fanner The district is well favoured as
regards the water supply, and there are very few farms where it
would not be practicable to have a small pumping plant and irrigate
a few acres. A patch of from 10 to 20 acres of irrigated land would
grow sufficient feed to tide over the dry spells, and an irrigation plant
should be regarded in the light of an insurance policy. Prudent
men nowadays insure their lives for the benefit of their families,
and they insure their houses and furniture against fire, and an
irrigation plant is undoubtedly one of the best forms of insurance
policies that any farmer can invest in,
We mentioned just now that some of the residents were waking
up to the value of irrigation. One of our enterprising farmers,
Pumping Plant at Goonal Station, Moree.
J. G. Snape's Pumping Plant, Quirindi.
Mr. Whitney, of South Gundarimba, recently invested in an
irrigation plant which is shown in the accompanying photographs.
Messrs, BUZACOTT & CO., Ltd., of vSyclney, a firm who have
devoted a great deal of attention to irrigation, were entrusted with
the order, and the plant was installed by their local representative,
Mr. Jas. Gibson, The engine is a 6 horse-power “ HERCULES” Oil
Engine, driving a 3 in. Centrifugal Pump. The water is being raised a
vertical height of 40 feet from the river, and 10,ouo gallons per hour
are being pumped After the water is raised to the necessary height
the question of distribution comes in, and this is a line art, for
unless the water is economically distributed it is apt to be wasted,
The land to be irrigated very often is uneven, and the farmer, whilst
willing to invest money in a plant, hesitates when he considers the
cost of levelling the ground, In Mr. Whitney’s case a very
ingenious device was adopted, the water being pumped through
gulvanized-iron piping, in which, at regular intervals, are placed
sprays —an invention of Mr. Nnnan. The water from these sprays
covers an area of ground 40 feet in diameter, and the plant pumps
the equivalent of 1 in. of rain over four acres per day. This invention
has solved the problem of distribution of water, and it has this
advantage over the ordinary methods of distribution bv gravitation
that it is the nearest possible approach to natural rain, for in its descent it becomes aerated. Mr. Whitney speaks in very high terms of
his plant, and is more than satisfied with his investment.
In other districts in N.S.W., the benefit of the small irrigation plant has been proved time after time. The accompanying photographs
illustrate a plant supplied by Messrs. BUZACOTT & CO., Ltd., to Mr. J. G. Snape at Quirindi. This plant consists of a 4 horse-power
“HERCULES” Oil Engine, driving a 3 in. Centrifugal Pump. The quantity of water raised per hour is 10,000 gallons, but the vertical
height in this case is only 25 feet, and as the ground to be irrigated slopes back from the creek, the problem of distribution therefore was a
simple one. The water is distributed through channels, and the plant being portable can be moved along the bank of the creek as required,
platforms being made for the pump at suitable positions ; the work of changing the position only occupies a very short time. Mr. Snape had
this plant installed in 1902 —the record drought year—and during the whole of that time he had a lucerne paddock of 12 acres in extent, and
not only was he able to feed his own cows, but also had lucerne to sell, on which he realized a fine price.
There is no question that the Oil Engine is by far the best power to use. A plant can be purchased for a very moderate sum, and,
more important still, the working expenses are reduced to a minimum. Many have tried irrigating by windmills, but this is now recognized
as an antiquated method, for the windmill is entirely dependent on causes beyond human control for its motive power, and it very often
happens that when water is badly wanted the wind is taking a siesta. Windmills are gradually being discarded and Oil Engines used in their
place, as will be seen from the photograph on this page showing an Oil Engine Plant put in to do the work that the windmill was intended to
do. This photograph shows the Plant at Mr. P. C. Watt’s Station, Goonal, Moree.

“MYLOE.”
ON the main Ballina-Dismore Road, four miles from the centre of the latter busy town, is the well-named property, “ Mount
Pleasant.” And certainly a happy farm it is, embracing an area of 275 acres (200 in the original and 75 in the recent purchase).
. The former portion is very highly improved, and the latter felled and grassed. The subdivision of the farm was excellently carried
out. From the front gate on the main road through to the back of the property is a fine, fenced lane in the middle of the farm, on
either side of which runs a creek, forming a boundary to the property, almost parallel with the lane. The dividing fences of
the numerous paddocks run at right angles from the. right or left hand of the lane to each creek; consequently from this one
avenue all fields are avail-
able for the cattle. The
property in the early days
was the scene of much ac-
tivity. A, sugar mill, the
remains of which are to be
seen to-day, was erected on
the bank of a beautiful
creek : the same water-hole,
with the assistance of a
powerful windmill, send-
ing a magnificent supply of
water up the hill to the
homestead, where it is laid
on to kitchen, bathroom,

geries, and house paddocks.

he pins his faith to, and from which he has secured such highly successful results. The buildings on the farm are of a conve-
nient class for the carrying on of up-to-date dairy farming and breeding—bails, yards, barns, stables (specially constructed for
cattle), cart and buggy sheds, a new modern, roomy steam dairy, steam washing plant for house linen, and portable boiler and
engine for firewood," &c. The whole place, with its splendid opportunities, is appropriately named “Mount Pleasant.” It is with
much regret that we mention that Mr. Gray, requiring a change,may sell out. For the good of the district generally, we trust his
successor may be equally successful from a dairyman’s standpoint.

GROUP OF THE FIRM.
fHE workers of this indefatigable Firm are the well-known Richmond River residents,
JOHN ELLIOTT and S. R. COOK., until recently two of the Leading Dairy
Farmers of the Richmond, and JOHN DYMOCK, the well-known Salesman of the
Northern Rivers. They have had long acquaintance with the necessities of the
land and stock that go to make the best homes and the finest herds in this great
District. The first two members of the firm have, for a great many years, undertaken the
practical work of selecting, clearing, grassing, fencing, and stocking of various properties
throughout the River, and must consequently be fully conversant with all that is necessary
to make the best—the SOIL that grows the most, and that which grows the BEST ; also the
class of land that not only grows the best, but HOLDS the best.
Space is too limited to permit of enumerating the many practical and all-important
points to the man who seeks “ fields fresh and pastures new ” that these men of long-con-
tinued experience CAN and WILL afford to searchers after land and stock, but buyers would
do well to consider whether the services placed so readily at their disposal by this well-known
and much respected Firm should not be availed of by letter, either in advance of or imme-
diately upon arrival on the Rivers. They are prepared to stake their high reputation -on the
results proving satisfactory, as they possess the knowledge necessary for the selection of a
farm capable of producing
all the splendid grasses which
so materially assist in the
production of butter.
Their extensive experience
amongst the finest grades of
Dairy Cattle is answerable
for the nucleus of a large
number of the Choicest Herds
on the River. They are also
in the front rank of the most
successful prize winners at
the shows in the vicinity.

“QUEEN.” —A grand old type. (Bred by Owner.)
DURING the early stages in the compiling of this work, Mr.
Cooke owned both the above choice properties—“ Glenfield,” with
its 244 acres, and “ Railway View," with its 225 acres—both
ideal farms, at the head of the great Cooper’s Creek Valley, and
magnificently watered and grassed. Deciding to join Mr. John
Elliott in the auctioneering business, he sold his fine homestead
“ Glenfield," and removed to a more convenient locality near Lis-
more, at Bexhill. Coming here in the early period of the settle-
ment of the Rivers, he imported largely from the South Coast
the finest grades of cattle procurable, thereby facilitating
improvement in the type of cattle in vogue in the early days.
Since his arrival on the Richmond he has been closely associated
with all the forward movements that had the advance of the
dairying industry in view, being a member of the committee of
the Bangalow and Lismore Agricultural Societies, and with but
a short lapse from their earliest days, was one of the pioneer
directors of the N.C.F.F.C.S. Co-operative Butter Factory at
Byron Bay. He still retains his seat on the board. For a number
of years he was also one of the foremost cattlemen, taking scores
of prizes. He bred many of the finest dairy cows and bulls which
have since formed the nucleus of some of the fancy herds of
the Richmond and Tweed Rivers.

JOHN ELLIOTT,
PROBABLY no man on the
Richmond River has had a wider
or more varied experience in
matters appertaining to land and
stock than the above, who is one
of the very best known men on
the Rivers. His knowledge is
of “ Nature born,” having been
from boyhood practically con-
nected with all classes of stock,
both as a successful breeder and
large buyer. He has owned
many farms, which he has
worked and supervised; he has
selected and cleared the land,
then grassed and worked it. Fie
is one of the best known breeders
of horses, cattle, and pigs, scor-
ing heavily at the local shows,
and has always evinced a keen
knowledge of what constituted
the best in these lines. After
spending half a lifetime in per-
"YOUNG ROBIN HOOD.”
Lismore, R.R.
fecting his knowledge concern-
ing land and stock, he has, as
may be seen by the opposite page,
gone into the auctioneering busi-
ness with other very well-known
men, the combination offering to
intending purchasers a valuable
and unique fund of practical in-
formation, that must be of great
value to buyers of land or stock.
The accompanying pictures show
some of his favourite class of
horses, the stock of “ King Tom"
and " Robin Hood" having
served to make a name already
familiar still better known. Mr.
Elliott, who is a member of the
Lismore A. and I, committee, is
always found ready to take a
practical part in anything for the
advancement of the district and
the industries that support it.

CADBURY BROS., Ltd.
Cocoa and Chocolate Manufacturers,
AND
BOURNVILLE, ENGLAND, 267 George Street, SYDNEY.
MELBOURNE: BRISBANE, ADELAIDE, HOBART, &c.
* S vousulerably wore than half a century since the Firm of CADBURY BROS., the Cocoa and Chocolate Manu-
lecturers, was launched, but it is only during the past 25 years that they have come into repute in all quarters of the
li-3 Y[ v world. In this they are not unlike the Richmond River District. There is a good deal of comfort in the old adages—
If ‘ ‘ quickly come, quickly go,” and “slow and sure wins the race;” for if neither CADBURY BROS, nor the Richmond
River have been very slow, they have not grown like mushrooms, but HAVE GONE STEADIEY FORWARD,
sf eac * t advance being a stepping-stone for a future stride. Up to 1880, Cadbury Bros.’ factory was confined within
ts >e t ' OUr walls of u building in the heart of the city of Birmingham, and the employees had not exceeded 300 hands. At that
time their women and girls were the choicest of the factories of Birmingham ; none were engaged except on personal reference,
and after a visit by one of the female members of the firm’s family to the home of the applicant. Such was the system in which
( ;) J\ their present staff of 4,000 hands was built up, and if such close personal attention is not possible now, it is still true that
- ■ every care is taken to ensure engagement of only the best physically and morally. Between masters and men the best of good
feeling has always been manifest. And in the whole course of their history nothing akin to a disagreement has ever come between
, them. The latest evidence of the care of CADBURY
BROS, for their hands is shown in the Pensions’ Scheme
which has been launched, whereby they themselves put
down £1 for every /,’ r subscribed by the workmen, and a
sum of £6 0,000, to pay up the subscriptions of all old
hands for half the period of their service, that they may
not suffer for having been “born” into the Company’s
service so much sooner than their younger fellows.
In 1880, CADBURY BROS, moved from the city
of Birmingham to the pleasant country five miles out, on
the banks of a pleasant stream called the Bourn, naming the
locality Bournville. The work of building, commenced in
1879, has never ceased to this date, and now there exists
at Bournville a factory which for convenience, sanitation,
and comfort, is a model for the world. All that thought-
ful care can suggest within reason, is done for the employees,
even to magnificent open-air swimming baths for the men,
and indoor for the girls, the necessary arrangements for
heating being provided in the latter case. A mansion in

the neighbourhood was purchased as a home for homeless girls employed in the works, and the grounds immediately surrounding it are set
apart as a recreation ground for all female hands, while a magnificent sports ground, with splendid up-to-date pavilion, is provided for the
men. Adjoining it other lands were purchased, and these now constitute the beautiful and world-known Bournville Village Settlement.
As to the products of Bournville, it might be thought that these are so well known that they need no “bush.” Still, even Cadbury’s
Cocoa may be an unknown quantity to some. It is what it professes to be, neither more nor less—Pure Cocoa—and pure Cocoa has been
called “ a perfect food,” as it approaches most nearly of all
vegetable products to milk in its ultimate composition.
Cadbury’s Cocoa is not touched by the human hands in
preparation, nor is anything added in any form. It is
made from the finest Cocoa Beans procurable, the excess of
fatty matter, which averages 50 per cent, in best qualities
of Cocoa, alone being extracted.
In some Cocoas, homoeopathic and others, this fat is
not extracted, but is attenuated or broken down by the
addition of arrowroot, etc., and sugar. Such admixtures
ought not to be allowed to pass as Cocoa, and as a matter of
fact when, years ago, CADBURY BROS, did make
these, they were called Chocolate Powder ; for the word
“chocolate” implies admixture—the admixture of Cocoa
with other ingredients. Generally speaking, anything
which contains a quantity of Cocoa, however small, has the
right to the name of Chocolate. It is thus easily seen what
a questionable article Chocolate might be, and the only
protection users have is in purchasing only such as bears
the name of makers of repute.
GIRLS' MIDDAY MEAL.
CADBURY BROS, employ a doctor to attend upon their workpeople when sick, as well as a staff of nurses, and so careful are
they of the public health that the hands of all employees are periodically examined, and every scratch, cut, abrasion of the skin or other-
wise is examined by the doctor without delay.
■ Many of the schools of the Richmond River District have, we believe, been supplied with a pretty specimen box, showing
its various stages from tree to table, together with a book, descriptive of its growth and manufacture. Some of these pretty
and useful boxes-

Geo. T. Whittaker,
“Rosemont,” Eltham, R.R.
UNDOUBTEDLY the most suc-
cessful farm on the Richmond
River when its size and produc-
tiveness are taken into considera -
tion. Its acreage, its milk re-
turns, its numerous prizes, its
value in young stock sales, all go
to make the little farm the
justly celebrated spot it is.
Only 13 years ago it stood in all it?
rugged grandeur, with rough ridges
and heavy timber, but time has effaced
all evidences of roughness, and now
we find a modern home with pretty
garden, fine outbuildings, ridge-topped
cornfields, grassy hillside, and feed-
clad valleys. When Mr. Whittaker
selected the 6854 acres of condition-
ally purchased land in 1893, the farm
needed a vast amount of work ex-
pended on it to put it in a paying
order. The labour of clearing timber,
collecting, stone, fencing paddocks,
planting grasses (the necessity of the
case compelling chiefly one’s own
labour), all had to be accomplished
before such could be the case. But
Mr. Whittaker persevered, and to-day

The acreage of the farm is 1,600, and is only two miles from the Myrtle Creek Railway Station (Casino-Gnifton line),
twenty miles from Casino, and twenty-three from shipping on the Richmond River. All grain and cattle are trucked
from Myrtle Creek Railway Sta-

GRASS and water are the two most striking - features of this wonderfully fine property, which consists of 83 acres of the very
best land on the rivers. It is situated on Pearce’s Creek, to which it has a frontage of one mile. The road from Lfismore
to Newrybar, Tintenbar, and Ballina, via the Creek, passes through the farm, which includes lovely fiats on which grass grows
in profusion, principally prairie, from which he believes the best results are gained. Mr. Carr came to the Rivers over 20 years
back, and searched about till he found “ Drumwood,” where, 10 years ago, he settled down to farm life, and to-day, as the
illustrations will show, possesses some splendid specimens of milking Durhams. His experience places them at the head of all
breeds of milkers, the results having- been most satisfactory; as he quaintly remarks, l< If she no longer milks, there is something-
left for the butcher.” A visit to Mr. Carr’s (13 miles from Lismore and one mile from Booyong Railway Station) wouM con-

Export of Dairy Produce.
A LITTLE more than a decade ago, few thought that New
South Wales would have taken such a prominent posi-
tion in the exporting of Butter to oversea markets as
she now occupies. Still less was it anticipated that the
Country in and surrounding the Richmond River District would
have developed to the extent of becoming, within that short
period, one of the most productive Dairying' districts in Australia.
Jt is little more than ten years ago, when practically the whole of
that area was almost entirely devoted to the timber-getting indus-
try, and the woodman’s axe was much more frequently heard
than the lowing of the dairy herd, which is now so pronounced
a feature in that far famed Dairying district. Soil, Herbage,
Climate, and a plentiful supply of good water, are all most
favourable to a further extensive expansion of the Dairying
industry, and although the value of Butter produced in that
district is now about £750,000 annually, every year is expected to
see a considerable increase—provided the rainfall is as satisfac-
tory as usual. Needless to say this development in the produc-
tion of Butter in the Richmond River and surrounding districts,
added to what was being obtained from the other centres, soon
increased the output to such an extent that the necessity for
finding external, as well as local, markets for almost the entire
year became apparent. In effecting this object farmers and dairy-
men had the advantage of the assistance and co-operation of the
great Australian Firm of DALGETY & COMPANY, LIMITED,
who had established a special department of their extensive busi-
ness, devoting its entire attention to the sale, in London and other
oversea markets, of Butter and other Dairy Produce.
DALGETY & COMPANY were in a position to make such
favourable arrangements in the direction of reducing cost of
marketing Butter that Factories were enabled to export to the
United Kingdom for sale there by that Company’s Eondon Office,
at charges such as Cold Storage, Ocean Freight, Marine Insur-
ance, Wharfage, Interest, and Eondon selling charges, equal in
all to about, id. per lb., or very little more than x / 2 d. above what
it costs to sell Rutter in the local market. They moreover advance
liberally against consignments as they receive them, so as to
enable Factories to pay suppliers long before the Butter, in
respect of which the advance is made, is sold. In addition,
DALGETY & COMANY advise their Clients week by week of
Eondon market conditions and prospects, as cabled to them by
their London House, and obtain for them other information of
interest free of charge. Their large connection with London
and provincial buyers enables them to always obtain full values,
whilst their system of acting only as Agents assures their Clients
that they will have their interests fully conserved. This method
of selling Export Butter on Factorie's account in England, bv
DALGETY & COMPANY", has proved so eminently satisfactory
to the producers that a very large number of the leadmg Factories
in this, and the neighbouring States, are Consigning their Butter
to DALGETY & COMPANY, thereby maintaining in the flush
of the season payable rates for that portion of their output dis-
posed of on the Sydney market; besides securing, as a rule, a
surplus over the advance on the portion exported. Prior to
the advent of DALGETY & COMPANY into the Butter busi-
ness this surplus went, in most cases, into the pockets of a few
local and London speculators, who, possessing market information
not then so easily obtainable by Factories as, thanks to DAL-
GETY 7 & COMPANY, it is now, were thus able to practically
buy at their own levels and ship to London, with the certainty of
a handsome return. Though, perhaps, the days of wide margins
have passed, the cable facilities and sources" of information at
the disposal of this Company, ensure that any important happen-
ings in London, and market prospects in g'eneral, are speedily
disseminated among the Clients of the Company, by which means
local values may be kept very close to the parity of those ruling
in the World’s markets, thus ensuring to the producer the full
value of his product.
Closely allied to the Butter Industry is that of the Pig', and
as the supply has recently overtaken the local demand, and the
requirements of other States, it was deemed advisable to exploit
the London market so that when, as it surely must, a regular
export of our surplus becomes necessary, a customer will be at
our hand. With this end in view several experimental shipments
both of Pork and Bacon were made by DALGETY & COM-
PANY on behalf of their Clients with gratifying results, and
there seems every reason to believe that the shipments now
regularly despatched will, in course of time, assume large
dimensions. f>
The illustrations accompanying this article depict Butter
being discharged from Thames barges, after being- brought up
the river by them from Australian Liners, into the London Selling
Warehouse : the second is a portion of one of the sample rooms
showing boxes of different brands opened up for the inspection of
buyers, whilst the third represents the same store on the land side
adjacent to London Bridge, and shows the Butter in course of
transit by cart to the buyer. This store is within a stone’s throw
of Tooley Street, the great Butter centre of London, and more-
over, is under the same roof as the Home and Foreign Produce
Exchange—where buyers from all over the United Kingdom
meet—its advantages are, therefore, apparent.
One of the most substantial benefits for which the Dairving
Industry is indebted to the influence of DALGETY & COM-
ANY is the reduction of freight to London from ■Rjd. to 3/Bd.
per lb., or from £7 to £3 10s. per ton. This reduction, as well
as the agreement to carry Butter at a much lower temperature
than had hitherto been the case, were mainly due to the efforts
of DALGETY 7 ' & COMPANY. The importance of this conces-
sion will be realised when it is pointed out that the reduced
freight means a saving of upwards of £75,000 in the export of
Butter from Australia to the United Kingdom during the past
year.
During the past to years the export or import of Butter
for this State has been as follows;
In the drought year of 1902 it was needful to import the
amount mentioned above, to eke out our own supplies.


A PAIR OF THE BEST IN THE STATE.

THE INVERCAUED AYRSHIRES.
THE Invercauld herd of pure Ayrshire cattle was founded by
the late H. O. B. Wilson, Esq. (a son of the founder and namer
of Eismore), in ISB4. The Invercauld Estate adjoins the muni-
cipal boundary of the town. Invercauld comprises 500 acres
of rich black soil fiats and undulating ridges, and 500 acres
of brown and red soil scrub land, which is now cleared and under
Paspalum and other artificial grasses. The first animal purchased
was the pure Ayrshire bull " Nero,” bred by the late John Grant,
of Seafield, Victoria. “ Nero” won first in S} 7 dney as a two-
year-old, and was never beaten on the Rivers, either as an Ayr-
shire bull or dairy bull, and judging by his stock, was undoubtedly
one of the best dairy sires ever on the Rivers before or since.
“RAPIGO OF OAKBANK.”
Champion Ayrshire Cow, Sydney, 1899.
Closely following on “ Nero’s” purchase, was the securing of four
pure cows, including “Blanch,” champion of Sydney Royal
Society. These were got from Mr. Pemell, of Randwick. The
next batch from the same breeder numbered three pure heifers
and one young bull, “Topper of Randwick,” by the “Duke of
Barbiston” (imp.), from “Topper of Drumlanrig” (imp.). This
bull cost Mr. WTlson 50 guineas, as a nine months’ old calf. With
these cows and their progeny Mr. Wilson won most of the prizes
for Ayrshires at the local shows. Mr. H. O. B. Wilson, senr,,
died in 1891, and the herd was taken over by his sons, H. O. B.

of Wilson Bros., and they in 1898 bought at the dispersal sale of
Mr. James Gibb, of Berwick, Victoria, seven head of pure cows,
including '‘Blue Belle of Oakbank,” three times champion cow of
Victoria. The following year they purchased the champion Ayr-
shire cow “ Rabigo of Oakbank” for 100 guineas. This cow was
first in her class, two and under three, and champion Ayrshire
. female of the yard. They also acquired the Ayrshire bull “Rarity
of Oakbank" for 80 guineas, whose dam has a record of 20 lbs.
of butter for the week, and was twice champion of Melbourne
Royal Society, and his sire “Glen Elgin’s Bruce,” was four times
champion. The present head of the herd is “ Prince Roy,” the

ON a fine stretch of country up the Goolmangar
Valley, and situated on the right hand side of
the creek, on the winding road from Lismore to
Nimbin, is the well-known property of “ Straw-

Mr. L. Hayden, senr. A nice run from Lismore
ot seven miles, brings one to the estate, with
its two pretty residences. The first of these, the
homestead, situated on the crest of a little rise
adjacent to the roadside, is in the occupation of
Mr. L. Hayden, junr.; the second, “ Avonmore,”
on a further gentle rise, is occupied by Mr. and
Mrs. Hayden, senr. This fine property comprises
900 acres of choice land, exceptionally well ap-
pointed for mixed farming, having been con-

namely, butter shipping abroad. “ Strawberry Hill,” as here shown, was the original residence of the Havden family •

THIS is a portion of the well-known “ Strawberry Hill Estate/’ and consists of beautiful undulating country, with a fine, pro-
tecting ridge on the one side, and an everlasting water boundary on the other, and intersected by the main Eismore-Nimbin Road.
At once a fine dairy farm, an excellent grass country, and splendid green fodder and maize producing land, a grand conbination
for the practical up-to-date farmer, a place in true accord with the highest ideals of the man who believes in the old adage,
“God helps those who help themselves.” This farm is capable of running a big herd of cattle with absolutely no attendant hard
work; but to the man who wishes to augment the already goodreturns, what a splendid opportunity a property like this affords
for a display of practical farming. It can be safely asserted that few farms on the Richmond River allow a finer scope for high-

of farm life, that this district is so well suited for. Building, improving, and subdividing “ Hillside,” he started milking with
thirty head of cows, chosen from the high standard of Illawarra bred cattle in the possession of his father at Strawberry Hill,
and for which some distinction had been gained at various shows. The property, consisting of 240 acres, is eight miles from Eis-
more. A very good idea of the types of cattle may be formed by a glance at the pictures presented on this page, and which
faithfully represent those chiefly used on these two estates. The one thing beside a good cow that reaches Mr. Hayden’s heart is a
good horse. He usually possesses something good, “Iridium,” to wit, who is by “First Water,” and has won over 20 races, includ-
ing the Richmond River Turf Club Handicap, Sires’ Produce Stakes, and the Southport Handicap at Brisbane. It is an indica-
tion of the spirit of the times to find many of our farmers capable of loving a good horse as well as a good cow.

O. H. GOLLAN
"Woodburn Farm”
Woodburn, R.R.
TFIIS fine old property, comprising nearly 1,000 acres of rich alluvial river flats, is owned by Mr. Win. Gollan, T.P., who came
to the Richmond River from the Shoalhaven district, over 40 years ago, being one more of the remaining early band of hardy
pioneers. Some ten years ago a portion of the estate (200 acres) was handed over to the subject of this page, who bears the dis-
tinction of being the first white child born at Woodburn. He has since bought the adjoining property of 1:60 acres, and carries on
a large horse stud farm, besides running two dairy herds. All kinds of stock do exceptionally well on the property, which grows
Paspalum, couch, clover, and other well-known varieties of grasses. Mr. O. H. Gollan has been breeding horses and standing-
stallions for the public service for the past nine years, and always keeps his stables full of high-class animals. He bred his first
draught horse “ Sultan,” who left behind him excellent working stock. This horse was followed by the Victorian bred “ Border
“NOBLEMAN.”

Zealand horse of great size
and quality, and a noted

added to the stud. “ Wal-

son of the mighty “ Chester,” bred by the late Hon. Jas. White, left his mark in the district by producing racehorses, splendid
hacks and harness horses. After “Albermarle” came the imported “ Nobleman,” a particularly fine-looking big horse, a good win-
ner in England in Lilly Langtry’s colours, and the sire of a great number of winners in Australia. His stock on the Rich-
mond are only two years old, and have already won great distinction in the show ring and on the racecourse. Handsome
little “ Fernando,” the winner of the Queensland Derby, Brisbane Cup, and Sandgate Handicap, beside championship honours at
all the district shows, is the sire of an army of winners and high quality stock; he also has his home at the Woodburn stud.
Mr. Gollan has won championship prizes at all the district shows with his stallions; and at Coraki he has frequently gained the
blue ribbon for dairy cattle. The pride of place in his dairy herds is held by the Jerseys, the remaining cows having a large infusion
of South Coast blood. He and his only brother own the Woodburn Butter Factory, and pay out from £l,OOO to £1,500 per
month to their suppliers. The owner of this farm is also a good sport, and is depicted on this page holding two of his racehorses,
“ Winsome” and “ Foreman,” both of whom have won at the different meetings in the district. He is also an auctioneer, with
a large and increasing connection, and generally leads a very busy life.


W. C. GRAY
Pearce’s Creek , R.R.
"Mayburn”
ASSOCIATED with the finest milk and test-producing' cattle on the rivers, is the name of \¥. C. Gray. Although an enthusiast
in every way, it was only by the most extreme efforts that Mr. Gray won his way to the top of the ladder. Considering the
splendid cattle he has had to compete against ; and the numerous prizes he has won, the positions he holds to-day in the cattle
world are extremely creditable to him. He succeeded in winning the only two gold medals given by the North Coast Association
Dairy Herd Book for cows making the record average of butter during a period of five months; and a perusal of this Dairy Herd
Book will show a number of the champion butter-test cows of the rivers competing. “ Mayburn" possesses everything of im-
portance to a butter farm—locality, grass, water, &c. It is situated on the Alstonville-Booyong Road, and is two miles from
the Railway Station and Post Office of Booyong, 14 miles from Lismore, 13 from Ballina, and 18 from Byron Bay It is
subdivided into a number of paddocks, splendidly watered by Pearce’s Creek, and several springs, and has a fine, new, commo-
dious residence, with all necessary outbuildings. It is grassed with Paspalum, prairie, rye, couch, cocksfoot, lambs’ tongue and
clover. It possesses very handsome cattle, and the beautiful Milking Shorthorn and Durham-Ayrshire cross herd is among
the finest to be seen on the Rivers.

THE subject of Farm Life is necessarily divided into many sections. There is the Land comprised

Grass and Green stuff which grow on hill and dale, to be gathered in when Harvest Time comes ;
and then the

he has a fine run of 4,400 acres,
which is devoted to fattening

at Murwillumbah and jumps aboard the fast river steamers to the Tweed Heads, and picks up the Brisbane train, it is hard to
realise that in those early days you had to make that long trip in a small pulling boat for everything you wanted to eat, or wear,
or use. “ Warrana” in those days was all dense standing scrub. To-day we see it a grand, cleared property of 600 acres, with its
fine homesteads, its up-to-date milking sheds, and all necessary out-buildings, probably one of the most
picturesque farms in the State. It is laid down in
all the most approved grasses, and divided into
three farms, one being devoted to cane growing,
and two to milk production. Mr- Charles’ asso-
ciation with the progress of the whole district is
everywhere apparent. He was one of the provi-
sional directors of the great Byron Bay Butter

obtained at his clearing-out sale when his health
necessitated a change and he removed to Goot-

brought the splendid average of ip ss. Surely
this is a fine indication of the keen judgment that

GROUP OF JERSEY HEIFERS.
Amongst the numbers are winners of first, second and third prize, Lismore and R.A. Shows, Sydney.
IN the front rank of the Jersey breeders for some time past, and each year making a further effort and securing fresh honours,
Mr. Booker has again and again demonstrated in most practical fashion his determination to leave no stone unturned in placing
before the public of the Richmond River the very best of that type of cattle in which he has been so constant a believer—the
pure-bred Jersey and the Jersey cross dairy cow. To those who have watched his movements and his results, the effect has been
to induce many to believe and admit that under his supervision the Jersey and its cross has been a profitable investment. Under-
standing the elements that go to make success in crossing cattle, he has shown much that has been interesting and practical. He

has brought to the Rivers, at considerable cost, the purest of sires and cows, he has mated and crossed them, and the results
have been all that could be desired—good quality, good frames, good vessels, good tempers, easy milkers, rich, yellow
skins, and above all excellent testers. The prices he received at a reducing sale some little time back proved the thorough
appreciation of his ideas, and the result has been the distributing throughout the district of some of the finest types of that class
seen on the Northern Rivers. As may be gathered from the accompanying pictures, Mr. Booker owned some of the leading
Jersey cattle in the country, and it is certain that the district is the gainer by the introduction of this beautiful type of milker.
“SYLVIA.” Pure bred Jersey; heavy milker and prize winner.
“JENNY.” Pure Jersey cow; highly commended at R. A.
Show, Sydney.
It is always possible for people to secure young stock here, as the owner believes in popularising this breed by placing them on
the market at reasonable figures, he being exceptionally fortunate in having a fine property, specially adapted for successful rearing
of young dairy cattle. It is about seven miles from Lismore, on the main road to Ballina, one mile from the Government Experi-
mental Farm/consisting of 230 acres of mixed scrub and forest land, excellently watered and well sheltered, divided into twelve
paddocks and highly grassed. This is the farm on which Paspalum was first introduced, and whose situation is one of special
suitability for breeding and convenient for dairying, the cream going from the gate to the Alstonville Factory by vans. All
improvements are at hand, including a comfortable home and all necessary out buildings.
“PRINCE EFFINGHAM.” Winner of nine first and champion
prizes at Lismore and Alstonville. Sire, “Effingham
Duke.” (imp.)
“BEAUTY.” Heavy milker, giving 40lbs. milk with 4.4 test.


THOUGH a dairyman owning
one of the finest farms in the dis-
trict, it is as a horse-owner that
he is so well-known to the whole
of the show-visiting public of
the Richmond and Tweed. For
many years past he has been
a consistent exhibitor of horses,
scoring numerous prizes every
season with weight-carrying
and harness horses, some of
them holding almost unbeaten
records. His splendid property
consists of 432 acres of heavy
scrub land; but after years of
labour it now presents hills and
vales alike of waving fields of
grass, studded with a very high
grade of dairy cattle. It is situa-
ted on the Lismore-Byron Bay
Road, about 15 miles from either
place, and adjacent to the Spring
Vale Public School, and is laid
down in Paspalum, prairie, rye,
cocksfoot, and clover, and

which it has a mile frontag'e. The estate is divided into three farms, which have been let, as Air. Taylor had retired for some
time from dairying; but feeling the necessity for a more active life, he has commenced again, and shows some choice
milkers in great form, principally Durham - Ayrshire cross and Jerseys. Pie goes in for planter and maize chiefly as
green fodder for his stock. All improvements are of a very solid nature; homesteads, barns, bails, factory and other require-
ments are all in evidence, and show the progressive nature of the locality.

It is a fine, open forest country
of 6,500 acres, divided into two
dairy farms of 350 acres each,
worked by tenants on the half-
share system; the remainder is
used for fattening purposes, and
is all ringbarked and mostly laid
down in various grasses. “Mer-
rigan” is a well-improved estate,
with comfortable homes for ten-
ants, bails, and all necessary out-
buildings required for this class
of property. There are various
types of cattle used; those of
the Jersey and Jersey-Durham
cross being principally in favour.
The place is watered by Boorabee

THIS is a very attractive farm,

down in grasses, which thrive and
grow in a wonderful manner. Pas-
palum, prairie, and clover afford
luxuriant feed for the fine lot of
cattle that are maintained at
“ Guida,” and a run out there from
Eismore, a very pretty drive of n
miles, will be a revelation as to the
growth of Paspalum. Soil, rainfall,
and climate are here strongly in evi-
dence, and when all fully cleared
and grassed, the place will indeed
rank as a very fine estate, capable
of carrying more than one fine dairy
herd. The principal breeds of cattle
are milking Shorthorn and Ilia-

Farmers and Dairymen a magnificent fleet of first-class passenger
and cargo vessels fitted with all the latest and modern appliances
for the successful carrying on of their trade.
These districts, which but a comparatively short time ago
were great rich forests of big timber and standing brush, together
with the difficulties offered by the Bars and the smallness of
the trade, in the early days proved the determination of the
Company to cater for the Rivers’ requirements, and it is to
them in no small measure the district’s prosperity is due.
The building of new steamers and supplementing their
already fine fleet, and acquiring new steamers, also remodelling
those not up to date, the present service places the Northern
Rivers in the proud position of being the best catered for in
the Australian Commonwealth.
About the year ISBO, Mr. T. R. Allt, who had been asso-
ciated with the Company’s career since 1861, took practical
control of the operations of the Company. largely through
his efforts quicker and more frequent services were established
with the different rivers, and concurrently with this improved
means of communication commenced the more prosperous
and sound financial phase of the Company’s career. Several
competing interests were acquired, and the (t Comki” and
the “Tomki” were put into the Richmond River trade. The
excellence of the service at this period, as compared with
the original once-every-ten-days trips, had its effect on the
Northern River trade, which was rapidly falling into the hands

of the parent Company. In December, 1888, it was again
re-formed, under the style of the “ Clarence, Richmond, and
Macleay Rivers Steam Navigation Company, limited,” with
a capital of £150,000 in £1 shares, and with extended powers.
The Company purchased splendid water frontage accommo-
dation for their fleet and for the storage of produce at a very
large cost, and made every possible effort to ensure the
successful and expeditious handling of the rapidly growing
traffic. As a result produce is now conveyed from the
farm to the market without any trouble to the producer. The
Company’s store in Sussex Street is practically the maize centre
of the metropolis. The John See & Co. line of steamers were
acquired, and the name of the Company was altered to the
present name in 1891, and John See (now Sir John) became
Managing Director of the new Company in conjunction with the
Chairman, Mr. T. R. Allt, who, by the way, had remained in the
chair since 1880, and still remains in charge after 24 years of un-
broken service. The object of the purchase just referred to was
to economise management, to give reduced rates to the producer,
and to encourage further settlement on the coast, and anyone
who has a knowledge of the development of the North Coast will
realise what an important factor in that equation this policy
has been.
Its management has been conducted from time to time by
such sound business men as the Hon. J. B. Watt, M.E.C., Mr.
W. 0. Gilchrist, Mr. John Alger, the Hon. E. D. Ogilvie, the
Hon. Henry C. Dangar, M.R.C., and Mr, Arnold (a late Speaker

Jas. Rice
“Green Vale”
Newrybar, R.R.
AS recently as 12 years ago this was a patch of dense scrub, and perhaps no farm on the Richmond River demonstrates more
clearly the wonderful rapidity with which a change of face can be accomplished, than that of "Green Vale.'' The removal of the
heavy growth of big- timber and dense brush that covered every foot of this land had to be accomplished and the whole felled,
burned, cleared, fenced, and grassed before the wonderful returns from this farm were possible. Net it was all done in the space
of a few years, and one is surprised at the gratifying results, which speak volumes for the excellent butter productiveness of
this very justly celebrated district, which is indeed a heaven-born dairyland, a land that Nature seems determined to smile upon
with all her bounteous blessings. It was on “ Green Vale" that Mr. Rice had the distinguished honour of winning the Special
GREEN VALE. —Residence of Mr. Jas. Rice.
District Prize, for the farm giving the best results, making the fine average of £ 4 ss. per acre per annum for milk alone, exclu-
sive of calves, pigs, horses, poultry, &c., &c. The property originally consisted of 88 acres selected by Mr. Rice 12 years ago, the
first little hut he erected still being in evidence in one of the pictures, forming an interesting comparison, when contrasted with
his present homestead, or other buildings put up on the farm by him. After clearing this section of its heavy mantle, he grassed, and
fenced, and built. Fie then purchased a beautiful little adjoining property of 87 acres of the same fine class of gentle undulating coun-
try, interspersed with valley and stream, and all alike laid down in one great soul of Paspalum; and while we have the “ many
men” of “ many grasses,” we find in the owner of “ Green Vale” a staunch believer in the “ king of grasses,” Paspalum Dilalatum.
FARM BUILDINGS ON GREEN VALE.
The little hut on the left is the original residence, and the building on the right the present residence of Mr Rice.
J udging by the above results, no one can blame him. Close to the township of Newrybar, Mr. Rice has erected a plumber’s shop
and three fine residences. These places are a quarter of a mile from the Post Office. 2*A miles from the town and Railway
Station of Bangalow, 14V2 miles from the port of Ballina, 8 miles from Byron Bay, and 21 miles from Lismore. The fine milking
herd consists mainly of his favourite type of cow, the Durham-Ayrshire cross, some very handsome sorts being always on view.
Good horses and ponies, some up-to-date Berkshire and Poland-China pigs, and choice varieties of fowls, principally Silver Wyan-
dottes and Minorcas, constitute the surplus stock and hobby of the owner of this prosperous farm, which is so fortunate in its
rainfall, soil, and temperature.
A well-known turnout, and its popular owner,


HK accompanying illustration will convey some idea of the immensity of Messrs.
Griffiths Bros.’ business in Tea, Coffee, Cocoa, Baking Powder and Chocolate.
Prom a very small beginning a quarter of a century ago there has arisen, in
Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide, large warehouses which were found so necessary
to accommodate their ever-growing trade.
The popularity of their Teas may be estimated by the output of about twenty tons per
week, which could not be done except the quality was first class.
Being importers on a large scale they are enabled to purchase more advantageously than
others, the result of which is felt by the public.
The Teas are mixed by machinery, ensuring perfect cleanliness, never being once touched
by hand, so that their customers get the supplies direct from plantation to teapot. A feature
of the packing is the fact that all the tinware is made on the premises.
The manufacture of Cocoa and Chocolate has been attended with great success. The
latest machinery, combined with skilful work, has made the development of this branch of the
business_ a very important one.
MMessrs. Griffiths Bros, emphasise the fact of its perfect purity with natural colour and
flavour only, those Cocoas treated with Alkali being much darker in colour, without any distinct
advantage. The price is much below 7 imported varieties, also fresher.
fT - ’ Coffee enters very largely into the Arm’s business. Large stocks of the choicest beans
are always kept on hand, and being freshly roasted and ground daily have their flavoupunimpaired.
Fig Coffee is one of their specialities, being pure Figs roasted and ground, mixed with pure Coffee.
' A late addition to the business is the manufacture of Baking Powder, the sales of which
are a good index of its superiority,

THE whole property at “ Lin-

acres, as seen to-day, constitutes
a farm of great beauty. It was
formerly covered with dense,
heavy scrub, but has, like thou-
sands of other properties, under-
gone the clearing process and
presents a changed aspect. The
handsome foliage, the enormous
timbers, the dense undergrowth,
has been removed, and one i-
lost in amazement at the change
that has come over the face of
the country. But what a prac-

“Spring Vale Estate”
THE SPRING VALE HOMESTEAD. —A good example of the fine farm homes on the Richmond.
Spring Vale, R.R.
SEEKERS after practical experience cannot do
better than interview Mr. Gay. who is quite an
authority on the growth of the Rivers and the
prosperity of its residents, having lived there for a
period of 23 years, although, perhaps, the actual
development lias occurred in little over half that
time. Leaving Robertson, on the South coast
of New South Wales, at the age of iS years, he
came to the Richmond River and selected a line
property of heavily covered, dense scrub laird of
4SO acres, on tire bank of Wilson's Creek. His
first work was to cut a track through the scrub
with a brush hook, and then to fell an immense
Booyoug tree, out of which he split sufficient
slabs to build the hut that became his home while
the period of his selecting continued. Four years
later he began to make preparations for erecting

a more commodious residence, and with the assistance of a man and a sawpit, cut the timber for his first house. In 1892 things
had progressed sufficiently to induce him to go South and bring back a partner for life, and upon his return he began dairying,
and, with the assistance of other men engaged in the same industry, cut the first road to the Eureka Factory. About the year
1890 he bought what he terms the ” Spring Vale Homestead” property, consisting of ISI acres. It was then only partly cleared,
and the balance scrub, with no buildings of any kind erected. Purchasing it on easy terms, and with the returns of his
dairy, which increased month by month, he soon made the " Spring Vale” farm a paying concern, and by the time it was
fairly cleared, grassed and built on, the herd had grown to about 100. He then let this farm for a term of five years at 15s. per
•acre, and at the expiration of that period he again let it at 255. per acre. After letting " Spring Vale” he returned to his original
Manager’s residence, Spring Vale.
selection, which he finished grassing and then cut up into three dairy farms, erecting all necessary buildings. He then sold a
portion and let the rest at 20s. an acre per annum, and having in 1809 got things on a payable footing, he decided on a rest and
-came to Lismore, buying the comfortable home he is now living in. However, he soon tired of an idle life, and in 1900 started
.as an auctioneer and land and cattle salesman, and to-day controls one of the finest businesses in the State. In 1902 Mr.
Gay bought the “Binna Burra” farm and let it to a good tenant, who is doing well on it ; and recently he purchased the splendid
property known as "’Rock Hill Estate,” comprising 760 acres—a really magnificent property. A study of Mr. Gay’s history
serves to show what the Richmond is capable of doing, providing men of pluck and enterprise are placed on its fertile lands.

AMONGST the many farms that one would like

its name implies, its situation gives it a pic-

vantage in small paddocks, he has cut this pro-

there always being in reserve some fresh area
on which the cows show improved returns and
greatly appreciate. “ Ocean View” is also blessed
with an abundance of splendid water from Skin-

The fine homestead is situated on the hillcrest,

its winding watercourse, waving fields, and many
homesteads, its views of townships, and glimpse
over hill and mountain top, together with many
hundreds of contented butter producers leisurely

can in some way realise the magnificent country
that this work describes. Coming to the Rich- '
mond River in 1888, Mr. Johnson bought “ Avon-
dale,” his other fine property being at Knockrow,
partly cleared and containing 120 acres. He then
selected a farm of 91 acres, and six years later
bought the adjoining piece of 84 acres, now
known as “ Valley View,” from whence this
beautiful outlook is obtained. The whole of these
three farms are highly improved, divided into
numerous paddocks, and laid down with prairie,
Paspalum, blue couch, water couch, lambs’

cow bails, pigstyes, calfpens, two and

the whole possession being completed with herds

BANG ALOW A. &. SOCIETY.
INAUGURATED 1897, the first meeting was held in Mr. T. Robinson's
house, and active operations at once starting, the first show was held on
the present site under the Presidency of Mr. E. Boyle, J.P., who held that
position for five years. PTis successor was Mr. Robert Campbell, J.P., who
was in office for two years; following him was Mr. Win. Fredricks, of
Tintenbar, for one year ; then Mr. Fred. Reading, for two years, and for the
present year (1906), Mr. Geo. Smith. For some time the ground was leased
from Mr. Robert Campbell, but in 1903 it was purchased at £5O per acre,
and since then progress has been marked, the results of which may be gained
from the clipping out of the committee's annual report appended herewith.
This property, situated in the heart of the town, fronts the Byron Bay-
Lismore Railway line for over thirty chains, and adjoins the Bangalow
Railway Station. Notwithstanding the marvellous strides made by this
great Damy Cattle .Society, it has only been keeping pace with the district;
and it is still rapidly progressing, even now occupying a position second
to none in the Northern Rivers as a daiity cattle show.
Extract from committee’s annual report, 1906: —
[Every year some additional improvement has been
made on the ground, and in reviewing the work of the Society
since its inception, now ten years, it may be mentioned that
over have been spent on improvements and the purchase
of land. Against this large expenditure there remains a
debt of only £gr igs. ud. This, we think, will prove very
satisfactory to all concerned in the welfare of the Society.]

Bangalow, R.R.
"Clover Hill”
View of Bangalow from the Homestead.
OVER twenty years ago, a
number of dairy farmers from
the South Coast, not finding
sufficient room for the expan-
sion of the dairying industry,
and hearing of the fine land on
the extreme Northern Rivers,
determined to settle there. At
that date the whole of the Nor-
thern Rivers’ district was cover-
ed with an impenetrable scrub,
requiring the expenditure of an
immense amount of labour be-
fore the land could be changed
into profitable farms. But, being
possessed with all the courage
of the early pioneers they did not
permit these obstacles to daunt
them in any way. All necessary
preparations were made for the

voyage of settlement, and they started out to prepare their new homes. On arriving at the Richmond River they immediately
commenced clearing the dense scrub, which proved no easy task, taxing their energies to the utmost. Both the axe and brush-
hook had to be freely employed before tracks could be made to permit the land even being surveyed, and this will give some
idea of the amount of labour the clearing of farms, hundreds of acres in extent, entailed. But they have since been amply
recompensed for their perseverance, and are now in possession of some of the finest farms in the Richmond district.

on the main road to the port of Ballina, on a splendid little property, magnificently grassed with the finest butter grasses,
he is giving considerable care to improving his herd of cattle. He has had some success in attending the show ring, and
possesses some very fine types of the Milking Shorthorn and Durham-Ayrshire cross, and hopes, by careful attention, to have
some fine young stock to place on the outside market. Mr. Boxsell has a very fine dairy bull (from a cow bred by P. McVicar, of

ANOTHER of the many farms that go to make up the name of the Richmond River. It is this class of farm, with its pasture
and fine quality stock, that strikes the visitor so agreeably, and speaks in such a way that the practical possibilities of the place
seem immeasurable. When you find so many men in one district who have such a high standard pf dairying, it goes without
saying that a splendid future awaits this great land which is developing at so rapid a pace. Here, as at other farms, the indi-
viduality of the man is apparent. His farm, his stock, and his methods all point to a practical issue, and it is fair to assume
that so long as the country have men with knowledge of this nature, little fear need be experienced for the continuance of
prosperity. The subject of this sketch is a keen young dairyman, who goes in for a good class of stock, and has had some success
in the show ring, owning some good horses as well as cattle. He is dairying on “ Maxwellton,” which contains over too acres of
very rich land, highly grassed with Paspalum, prairie, couch, cocksfoot, and clover; and crops of maize and various green
stuffs are grown for fodder. The principal grades of cattle are Durham and Durham-Ayrshire cross, which prove a very pro-
fitable type of milkers.

COMMANDING a beautiful outlook, adjoining Palmyra,

many years ago, and clearing and improving the fine property
to a high degree, he decided to erect a home that for now and
time to come would suit all requirements, beside enhancing the
value of the estate. It is an ideal dairy farm, capable of carry-
ing a very big herd of cattle of the type that the Fredricks are

into consideration, few indeed, if any, can beat it. A very
beautiful type of cow is to be seen here, the fine milking Short-

consistent points, and, consequently, the same fine herds, the same grand results. The whole elements and surroundings of
these men during their younger days had the tendency to educate them up to the highest point of practical dairymen.
Under the tuition of that fine old

with the necessary' buildings to carry on up-to-date dairying, as it ts now understood. It is subdivided into twelve
paddocks. The grade of cattle entirely used is the Milking Shorthorn, and many fine specimens are to.be seen here. It ~s

S. COOK,
"Glenfield," Rous, R.R.
MANY years ago the late Mr. S. Cook came to the Rivers, and
after residing in other parts, settled here in 1897 on a fine piece
of big scrub' country—one of the densest and heaviest timbered
spots about. Even to-day evidence of the fire-resisting timbers is
apparent, although the wonderful growth of grass greatly
obscures the remnant that remains. What it was, and what it is,
constitute a vastly different picture. With its fine homestead,
substantial outbuildings, beautifully-grassed paddocks, ploughed
fields, and windmill, it shows the essence of an up-to-date farm.
It consists of 140 acres of Paspalum, buffalo, cocksfoot, blue
couch, and clover; and is stocked with a sleek herd of Ayrshire and
Durham cattle —heavy milkers, fine breeders, and well-conditioned
cows —with a splendid type of sires. The property is well-fenced
and subdivided, and presents a fine effect, situated on the Rous-
Wardell Road, one mile from Rous Mill, eleven miles from
Lismore, and fourteen miles from Bailina —the town and port at
the entrance of the Richmond River. It is indeed a fitting monu-
ment to the energy and foresight of the late much-respected old
pioneer, Mr. S. Cook.

Wm. Munro,
Dunoon, R.R.
IT is our intention to trace back in a few lines the early days of this much respected pioneer, but before doing so we may mention
it is most gratifying to find him, after his early battles, spending his latter days in comfort and ownership of this fine property.
It consists of 310 acres of beautiful dairying country, 230 acres of it being big scrub land, and 80 acres heavily timbered forest,
splendidly grassed, chiefly with Paspalnm. It is divided into twelve paddocks fronting the main road to Lismore, and is
watered by a never-failing creek. Coming to the Richmond in April, 1866, he took up a selection on Steve King’s Plains. Very
few people had settled here in those early days, and there was but scant accommodation to be obtained —the old Horseshoe Inn
kept by Nathan Taylor, at Lismore, and the Durham Ox, managed by Mrs. Meanby, at Casino, being the only two available for the
business of the River. The only staple product open to the settlers at the time was maize growing', and as no ploughs were
available they were compelled to adopt the simple dabbing method for their corn. Yet, although so heavily' handicapped,
they succeeded in reaping heavy crops, though it was but a precarious living, since boats ran only at irregular intervals, and
freight was expensive—three shillings per bag being demanded by the timber boats to land the maize in Sydney, while the price
obtained there was only a low figure. John Manning ran the first steamer ,'Thc JVhnnca. but after trading for 12 months she
was wrecked on the Bar in the
year 1870. About 1868 nearly all
the River frontage of the Rich-
mond was taken up, the now
famous big scrub country on the
tableland scarcely being recog-
nised. Cane growing was started
in the early seventies, the sys-
tem being that the farmer grew
the cane, cut and delivered it to
the mills, and then received half
the sugar in return, which, how-
ever, was very poor, owing to the
crude machinery. But about the
year 1878 the Sugar Refining
Company established themselves
at Broadwater, and with their
liberal terms enabled the man on
the land to regain his credit,
which was at that time at the
very lowest ebb. A number of

profitable investment, went in
for the timber trade, chiefly pine
cutting, but that also became a
drug on the market. The result
was that living became very diffi-
cult, for the bar was in a bad
condition, and freights still ran
at high rates, the insurance on
vessels running to the Richmond
River being as high as 15 per
cent. For many years all land
business was transacted at Casi-
no, and the settlers were forced
to be content with one mail a
week, coming via Grafton,
through Codrington, Ballina,
and Woodbnrn, or Rockymouth,
as it was then called. The first
church was erected in 1867 by

had to “ pull” themselves there.
Many years passed before the
big scrub proved its attractions
to any degree, although an odd
man had the courage to face its
uncanny darkness. Mr. Andrew
Freeborn was the first selector
settling there about 1865, hut
more than a decade and a half
passed ere it began to be properly
opened up. A little business was
done in the early days by the few
selectors on the south arm, with
a man who owned a small
schooner, he taking their produce
and giving stores in exchange.

the necessity for a larger vessel,

GOING back to the early days of the
“ Big Scrub,” we . rind that not only
was the pioneer confronted with difficul-
ties attendant on the clearing - of his land, but
many other problems faced him that had to be
overcome. Chief amongst them was the get-
ting of the quantity of cattle of such a class
as would repay the outlay, and enable one to
form the nucleus of a herd whose progeny
would stand the wear and test of the future.
It is in this connection we find that Mr. Boads-
man was early in evidence, he bringing up
from the south fine types of dairy cattle on
the first trip made by the steamer Rich-
mond. The whole of this splendid herd of

property, seven and a-half miles from Lismore, -contains 292 acres, all
cleared, with the exception of forty, and carries as fine a covering of grass
as can be found anywhere in the country. The farm was selected by
Mr. Leadsman as far back as 1878, and he has, amongst other things, been
dairying evei since he came to the River. The place is very highly im-
proved, having, besides the comfortable modern homestead, all necessary
buildings found on the most up-to-date farms. In addition to raising- an
excellent grade of young dairy cattle, he also produces some fine horses.

SITUATED on the creek of the same name as the

it a very big carrying capacity and returning ex-

ON the Warded Rous Mill Road, one mile from the township of Rous, nine miles from the port of Warded, and eleven miles
from the busy centre of Lismore, is a nice, “ big scrub farm,” containing 96 acres of that rich chocolate soil, equal to anything
on the Richmond River. The farm is divided into numerous paddocks, enabling the owners to secure the great advantage of
frequent changing to fresh picking, on the many good grasses that grow here, embracing Paspalum, prairie, cocksfoot, and
clover. In clearing the farm, sufficient has been left for shade,while two acres have been laid down in fruit trees, one with citrus
the other with stone fruits. Ad necessary buildings are erected, and highly satisfactory results are obtained, both in breeding and
milking; and the herd is regarded as one of the most promising in the district.
“PRINCESS” (Jersey). Winner of two champions and seven

unsolicited approval of the PUBLIC to what we see it now, one
of the finest Draper}', Millinery, &c., &c., Emporiums in the
Australian Commonwealth. Surely this is a great compliment to
the HONOUR and steadfast business determination of the much
respected principals of this great business house, and their strict
observation in their grand motto. They evidently realise the
following to be a potent factor in success —which so many would-

"WANT,” MARK YOU, not with what you “DON’T” WANT,
You need not be afraid of having pushed on to you articles you do-

with smaller stores whose limited assortment cannot possibly give-
yon the choice that FINNEY, ISLES & CO. can from their
enormous stock. FTere you can get just exactly what you require,

their orders along with utmost confidence, knowing they will get
CIVILITY, PROMPTNESS, VALUE, EVERY TIME.

you want, a big staff of competent clerks being kept to attend
the requirements of Country Friends, Customers, or Inquirers.

This Firm needs no word of introduction. The history and
development of FINNEY, ISEEvS ’& CO. run with the history
and development of the State. It has been side by side with
Queensland through the prosperous and the lean years, in the
riotous days of 1566, in the depression of 1885, hi the time of
flood in 1893, and again in the period of drought which marked
the waking years of this new century. It was in 1864 that the
late Mr. Thomas Finney and the late Mr. James Isles laid the
modest foundation of the great enterprise now so closely asso-
ciated with their names. Later on in 1870 the growth of the
business led to a removal to Queen Street. Then came rapid
expansion when the population of Brisbane doubled itself in a
few years, and the great and increasing operations of the firm
were concentrated in the present splendid premises at the corner
of Edward and Adelaide Streets. On the 10th February, 1905,
the old business was converted into a limited liability company,,
and the management, which went for its success, still remains, Mr.
W. J. Coakes and Mr. J. Kilroe, being managing directors, the
former being chairman of the board. It is not out of place to-
mention that the superb little piece of horseflesh (nine hands
high) “ Lord Hercules,” which was the prince of attractions at
the recent Brisbane Show, that charmed our River visitors from
New South Wales, and the hundred thousand other eyes that
visited the last show, is the property of one of the genial
directors of this great firm (Mr. J. Kilroe). It is a notorious fact
that the keeness of business competition in Brisbane makes it
the cheapest drapery and clothing city in Australia. FINNEY,.
ISLES & CO. employ upwards of 500 hands in Brisbane, 40 in
Maryborough, and several at Murwillumbah, the latter place;
being a distributing sample room.

I reason to be proud of the many institutions in
their midst, which denote the great progress of
their country, but it is the pioneer Mutual Life Office—
The Australian
Mutual Provident Society
—which claims the pride of ip^ ace - So closely has its
success been allied with the prosperity of Australasia
that we feel the greatest pleasure in bearing testimony
to the wonderful strides it
has made during the 57
years of its existence. It
has issued 357,718 Policies
assuring no less a sum than
£107,000,609, while at the
end of 1905 there still re-
mained on the Society’s
books 197,851 Policies as-
suring £55,469,521, or con-
siderably more than half the
total business transacted
since its inception, and
during that period has paid
away to members, or
their representatives, the
large sum of £24,388,409.
The Society has received by
way of Premiums, considera-
tion for Annuities, etc., and
Interest, £51,524,991, while it has disbursed the sum of
£30,101,911, leaving in hand at 31st December, 1905,
accumulated invested funds of £21,423,080. In the early
days of the Society the profits were distributed every
five years, but since 1884 the distribution has been made
yearly. The total amount divided among the members,
by way of cash bonuses, has been £12,216,401, while
for the single year, 1905, the sum of £635,533 was the
amount distributed as a cash surplus.
The Society’s Policies are now free from all con-
ditions, with the single exception, that suicide within
13 months voids the Policy. Liberal Surrender Values
are allowed after the Policy has been two years in force,
and such Surrender Values are available so that Policies,
on which the Premiums are not paid within the 30 days
of grace allowed, are thereby automatically kept in force.
At the begining of 1905, the Society resolved to write
Industrial Assurance Business, consequently Policies may
now be secured for amounts from £5 to £lOO by pay-
ment of a Premium from 3d. a week upwards. The
limit of risk under an ordinary Policy is £lO,OOO.
In September, 1904, the
Directors, recognising the
growing importance of the
Northern Rivers Districts,
decided to establish a Dis-
trict Office in Lisrnore, and
subseq uenth' erected the
splendid buildings at the
corner of Magellan and Car-
rington Streets, which we
are pleased to have an op-
portunity to reproduce at

A portion of the So-
ciety’s Funds are invested In-
way of Mortgage on desir-
able securities in the district,
and it may not be considered
out of place to mention
that the Society is always willing to treat with applicants
for Roans on the Security of First-class Freehold and

The Head Office of the Society (which is shewn

Mr. Robert B. Cameron.
The Principal Board of Directors
meets weekly at the Society’s Head
Office. The Society will, we think,
be recognised as the best and most
successful Mutual Office in the world
to-day, and all the profits are divided
annually, solety among the partici-
pating members, who are recruited
from all classes of the people of Aus-
tralasia.

THIS property, situated on
the banks of the Richmond
River, at the confluence of
the north and south arm,

paddocks; also a splendid method of ensilage making,
in which Mr. Yabsley is a great believer, he achieving
highly successful results. His big silos, constructed
without nail or bolt, are a revelation of a most practi-
cal nature. Another thing that would please up-to-
date dairymen is the method of bails and style of
stools. The milking shed is a large room, in which
a number of cows are bailed up against the walls,
finding egress through a door on their off-side. The
stools sitting rigid on uneven ground is another of
Mr. Yabsley’s unique inventions, requiring to be seen
to be believed and appreciated. In one of the dairies
run by Mr. Mark Yabsley, the Lawrence Kennedy
milking machines are used, and after three years’ ex-
perience he expresses himself as thoroughly satisfied
with them. The whole of this extensive property is

well known for their milk and fattening properties;
and it is proposed later to subdivide it into dairy farms.
A start has been made in this direction, chiefly on
the river bank, 160 head of cows being now milked.
The back country is occupied in rearing stock, fine
grades of both cattle and horses being bred. Amongst
the latter are some fine Clydesdales, buggy sorts and
hacks, the WY brand being a-good guarantee. Im-
porting and breeding Durham, Holsteins, Ayrshires
and Jerseys to test, he has received excellent results
from each, preferring none. He has a big sawmill
at work, and foreseeing the probable scarcity of tim-
ber, he conserved his own, and has now five teams of
bullocks bred by himself drawing in his supply of
hardwood. A line racecourse, stand and enclosure
which he has erected on the estate have been placed at
the disposal of the Coraki Jockey Club.

SELDOM does a man own a sire of such reputation
as the one belonging to the above owner, for through-
out the whole length and breadth of the Northern
Rivers this great bull has made himself famous, at
show after show, and year after year, having scored first prize;
and championships, not only on his own merits, but incidentally
through his progeny, and his record is certainly of a very fine
order. “ Kelsoleigh” is situated on the north arm of the Bruns-
wick River, adjoining the railway station of Biilinudgei. The
railway line runs through the property, which consists of 960
acres, principally scrub land, a large amount of which is cleared
and laid down in grasses, such as Paspalum, prairie, cocksfoot,
couch, and clover. This grand piece of country is divided into
four farms, and is watered by five permanent creeks. The home-
stead has fine improvements, including comfortable dwelling, well-
covered milking yards and bails for 40 cows, and all other neces-
sary buildings, good houses and usual buildings being erected
on the other farms. The township of Biilinudgei is built on
“ Kelsoleigh,” and as evidence of its growing importance three
churches are about to be erected on land presented by Mr.

OVERLOOKING the progressive township of Mullumbimby,
and commanding a beautiful view of the Brunswick River and
the surrounding towering hills, through which the railwav from
Eismore to the Tweed tunnels its road, is the up-to-date home-
stead and farm of “Avontine.” Early associated with the place,
Mr. Reilly has carved out a home for himself that will stand the
test of time, and for situation and convenience, one that would
be hard to beat. With 120 acres of beautifully-grassed country,
he goes in for dairying on good sound lines, and the practical
results fully justify the measures adopted. The farm is watered
by Chnnbible Creek, and is divided into ten handy paddocks, all
laid down in various choice grasses, and replete with all those
necessary buildings required for dairying purposes. With its fine
herd of dairy cattle it creates a favourable impression at first
sight, which increases upon acquaintance and inspection. The
grade of cattle are mostly Ayrshire and Milking Shorthorn, from
which a good type of young dairy stock are produced. It is
interesting to note that few men in the district are more interested
in or work harder for the progress of the town and locality than
the much-respected owner of “ Avondale."

obtained by Mr. O’Connor will clearly prove.

Providence. But while the rapidity of the work is almost awe-inspiring, the effect is certainly most gratifying. Mr. Herman

IX describing this property we depict one of the finest “ Big
Scrub' farms on the Richmond. Viewed from any aspect it
is hard to equal; acreage, soil, surface levels, productiveness,
grasses, buildings, conveniences, stock, and rainfall, in short,
replete with everything pertaining' to an up-to-date farm.
A native of Tllawarra, and one of the first selectors in the
Robertson district, he selected this beautiful property some
2SJ/2 years ago. and the saying, ” he came, he saw. and he
conquered,” applies very aptly here. The farm consists of a
fine area of 640 acres, divided into four farms, the whole of
which (With the exception of 60 acres kept for a timber
reserve), is cleared and laid down in grasses. Three farms
are leased, and a family is employed to milk and farm the
fourth at the homestead. The property is split up into 25
paddocks, with comfortable dwellings, fine roomy, up-to-date
homestead, and a splendid lot of out-buildings, including
large hayshed, stables, cow bails, piggeries, factories, &c„
affording every facility for the most approved methods of
“ROIDELIS.”
modern dairying. Mr. Davis is also a very well-known
breeder of high-class blood and draught horses, having for
many years been a noted prize-winner, owning champion mares
and stallions. One is much struck with “ Beechley,” if only
for the unique possessions within its territory; there being on
on the property a church, hall, racecourse, and an hotel, and
also part of the township of Rous. Lismore is only 10 miles
distant; and a pretty drive of a few miles from the tableland
—-on which this fine piece of undulating country is situated
down the mountain side, brings you to either the river port of
Wardell or Eallina, the port at the mouth of the Richmond
River. The removal of the great surface of sub-tropical
scrub has left the paddocks free for the production of the
many fine grasses that grow and thrive so well on this rich
chocolate soil, principally Paspalum, prairie, couch and
clover; also oats, planter, maize, potatoes, sugarcane, peas,
beans, &c., grow to great perfection, and flowers, for which
Beechley is justly famed, bloom in profuse luxuriance, and
A GROUP OF FAVOURITES.
adding to its great attractions is a summer house
containing many choice sorts of ferns and orchids.
The farm is well-watered hy Youngman and seve-
ral other creeks and numerous springs, and one
is greatly struck by the fine herds of cattle and
handsome types of horses to be seen grazing
around, and which go so far to complete the ap-
pearances of contentment and comfort every-
where observable. Space prevents a detailed
account of this valuable property and stock, hut
it would very amply repay a visit by those anxious
to study the management of an up-to-date farm;
the buildings, land, grasses, crops, pigs, cattle,
and horses—all in that high grade and healthy
condition which enables one to say they are
essentially representative of all that goes to make
the Richmond famous.

From this humble beginning rose
an institution which has preserved
its continuity to the present day,
and which now ranks ns the largest
Bank in Australasia, and one of the
great Banks of the British Empire.
To what a huge concern it has
grown ! Compare the first and the
last balance-sheet, what great ends
from small beginnings ! The net pro-
fits earned by the Bank since its
establishment, and including pre-
miums on new shares issued, amount
to £10,791,0,T5, and its present annual
credit transactions amount to
£700,000,000.
It is obvious that au institution,
such as the one we are describing,
must owe its pre-eminent position to
the skill with which its affairs have
been conducted by the Directors and
Managers who, from time to time,
have had them under their control.
One remarkable circumstance is
the length of time for which (as a
rule) its higher officials have held
their positions. Thus (taking the
Presidents of the Bank) Mr., Thomas
Walker served from October, 1868,
to August, ISS6. Mr. Thomas Buck-
land, from August, 1886, to May,
1894. Then as regards general
managers, Mr. Black held the posi-
tion from 1824 to 1854. Mr. Shep-
herd Smith, from December, 1864,
to September, 1886; and Mr. George
Miller, from September, 1886, to
June, .1894 (the latter was a bank
officer of over thirty years’ stand-
ing, when he was appointed to the
chief managerslrip).
Mr, ,T. Russell French, the present
general manager, assumed the reins
of government on the Ist July, 1894,
Mr. French joined the Bank in 1863,
and after serving in various capa-
cities, was appointed to the inspec-
tors’ staff in New Zealand in 1874.
He returned to Sydney in March,
1887, having been appointed inspec-
tor at head office. The appointment
of chief inspector followed in 1891,
and that of general manager in 1894.
Mr. French is an up-to-date man in
every way. He is distinguished by
clear-sightedness and power of con-
centration, invaluable in the position
which he holds. His keen, incisive
manner 'betokens an accurate know-
ledge of men and affairs, while his
suavity of manner and prompt busi-
ness-like methods conduce to his
popularity, both in and outside the
institution he represents, and which
embraces a staff of over 1,400 mem-
bers. Mr. French was largely in-
strumental in founding the Institute
of Bankers of New South Wales, and
has always taken a keen interest in
its welfare.

SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA.
Jl STOR Y OF PROGRESS
WAY back in the early fifties there arrived in Sydney as a visiting musician a violinist
whose name, W. H. Paling, is to-day a household word throughout Australia.
After giving a series of concerts, Mr. W. H. Paling, noting the aptitude of Australians
- even in those early days for matters musical, decided to “ pitch his tent ” in Sydney
r" -r-1 gi ye tuition on Ins favourite instrument, the violin. Some short time after,
owing to the difficulty lovers of music had to procure the best from the old world, Mr.
Paling decided to establish himself as an importer of pianos and music, and with this
object in view rented a small corrugated iron building in Wynyard Square. As time went on,
the business progressed so that a move had to be made to larger premises. A few years more
and the same] I satisfactory state of affairs arose, and Mr. Paling, who had a few years before
turned his business into the famous firm of Messrs. W. H. Paling and Go., Ltd., built the pre-
mises where the head office is now located, 338 George Street, feeling sure that the premises,
which comprise six floors and basement, would be sufficiently large to accommodate the business ;
but such strides have the firm made by capable management and just dealings (being always
governed by their motto : “ That unless their customer is satisfied they are not ”), that to-day
the premises do not nearly suffice. At the present time the firm occupies in Paling's Buildings,
at the rear of the George Street shop, more than twice the floor space of the well-known shop
premises.
Any day you are in town and would like to be shown round, call in. A representative
will be pleased to conduct you over the whole establishment, and you will see a better show of
pianos, organs, and other musical instruments, including the famous Ola viol a, the world’s best
piano player, on which any person, even those with no knowledge of music, can perform all the
works of the great pianoforte masters-—than can be seen in any other establishment in Australia.
A magnificent parlour has just been opened to keep pace with the ever-growing demand for our
favourite talking machines. Concerts are given daily, and the world’s most famous singers—
Melba, Patti, Caruso, Sarasate, etc.—can be heard with life-like fidelity. All the latest records
are received monthly. Lists are forwarded] post free on application.
If you desire anything in the way of musical instruments or music, or any informa-
tion relating to matters musical, write, mentioning your requirements, and their experts will be
pleased to supply you with full particulars.

“Mount Tyagarah”
Byron Bay.
HIGH up on the hillcrest of a
branch spur of the ridges, so
noted for their wonderful grass-
producing properties, stands the
comfortable homestead known as
“ Mount Tyagarah." It com-
mands an excellent view of the
main road as it winds in and our
and onward to the sea coast, also
a beautiful glimpse of the great
Pacific being' obtained from this
estate, and included within the

ago, Mr. Wallis encountered all the vicissitudes of the early pioneer of the ‘‘ Big Scrub" country. Far removed from all
conveniences and luxuries, he had, like other early settlers, to work and live as best he could. Space forbids the recounting of
his many interesting experiences, listening to which I have wiled many an evening hour away. The vastness of the work com-
pleted throughout this district, the efforts, the zeal, the continued determination necessary in removing the dense cloak of
magnificent foliage, of huge timber, of sub-tropical vegetation, the replacing it with grasses, crops, homesteads, cattle, roads,
bridges, constitute a tale well worthy of publication. It is interesting to compare the means of locomotion then and now, for
as one looks at the handsome turnout driven by Mr. Wallis, it is hard to realise that in the earlier stages of developing this
country, their only means of car-
riage was the old-fashioned, but
much-respected wheelbarrow.
With this primitive concern,
along the narrow, rough tracks,
would be brought food or sun-
dries from the nearest store some
eight miles away at Brunswick.
Surely this is a picture which
practically demonstrates the re-
markable progress of the district,
for in place of the narrow, rough
or boggy tracks of the old cedar-
getters, we find many excellent
roads—graded, formed, and ma-
cadamized, leading in scores of

directions townships, schools and post offices, &c., springing up without number. A railway line runs from Grafton through
Casino, Lismore, Byron Bay, and on to Murwillumbah, on the Tweed, with its two train services a day, the many present
advantages being now completed by a fine fleet of steamers calling almost every day at various points of the district. Mount
Tyagrah is subdivided into four splendid farms, on each of which suitable buildings have been erected, the whole place being
worked as a dairy farm. It is
very conveniently situated, for
the many purposes of farming,
being only three-quarters of a
mile from the public school, 3
miles from Tyagarah Railway
Station, 6 miles from each of the
following places:—Byron Bay,
Bangalow, and Mullumbimby,
and 26 miles from Lismore, the
chief town of business on the
Northern Rivers of New South
Wales.
A MUCH-ADMIRED TURNOUT.


TWO MEN, THREE WOMEN AND SOME CHILDREN.
ONCK upon a time there were two men who determined to go upon the land, and behold they gathered together all
that they had and went. Now one of these men was foolish, and journeyed far inland, where rabbits and drought
prevailed, and where means of transport were few, and access to market difficult, and because he was land hungry,
and feared that his neighbours might covet more laud, he took up much country which he could not use, and the paj'raents on which,
with the cost of clearing and fencing, became a burden unto him. And it came to pass that having made little attempt at cul-
tivation, or conservation of fodder and water, his stock died, and he was left helpless on the land. And being sick at heart,
and weary of life, he gave up the ghost, and settled forever underneath the soil.
Now behold the wise man did not waste his time and money in journeying into a far country, but he took up one
hundred acres in the Richmond River district, where the soil is rich and fertile, the climate genial, and the rainfall sufficient.
He planted paspalum grass, which grew luxuriantly, and gave abundant food to his cattle, and he soon became wise from the
experience of those around him, by studying their methods of breeding, cultivation, and dairying. Factories near him took all
his produce, and paid him every month for it. His cattle rapidly increased in number, and his holding more than doubled in
value. From his roo acre block he soon obtained close upon ,£5OO per year for his cream, and was able to show about
per year profit from his pigs and poultry. Now behold this wise man became prosperous, aud did dwell in content in
this Beulah land. He hath a buxom wife and healthy, happy children, and they bless the day when “father settled on the
Richmond River."
Now once upon a time there were three women. Two were "foolish and one was wise. One of these foolish mothers
fed her young children on milk and water, on sour bread, aud on stray scraps of meat and vegetables. The children’s feeding
bottles were kept dirty and sour, and behold the little ones grew up stunted and sickly, or died at an early age. The other
foolish mother gave her children cheap biscuits, which contained little nourishment, and patent foods which were unsuitable,
and her children also grew up pale and weakly, or died when very young. But the wise woman, guided by common sense,
and by the experience of others, gave her children Arnott’s Milk Arrowroot Biscuits, upon which they thrived much and
which made them grow up strong and healthy, and behold she is a glad mother ! MORAL : Take up the Land in the
Richmond River District,
GIVE YOUR DEAR CHILDREN
Arnott's Milk Arrowroot Biscuits.
Analyst’s Report.
(In connection with this, read our
“ Instructions How to give the
Biscuits,” as published op-
posite.)
Messrs. W. ARNOTT, Ltd.
Dear Sirs, Newcastle.
W’e have analysed a mixture
til ade by taking one dessert-spoon-
ful of Arnott’s powdered Milk
Arrowroot Biscuits, and adding
to it half a cup of milk and half
a cup of boiling water, and we
find it to contain as follows :
Proteids - - 1.94
Fat - - - - 2.12
Carbohydrates - 4,49
Ash - 0.38
Water - - - 91.07
100.00
We are of opinion that this
mixture is an excellent food for
children, and if a little sugar is
added it may be used as a substi-
tute for mother’s milk. The bis-
cuits themselves are rich in con-
stituents which go to form fat and
muscle.
Yours faithfully,

Instructions How to give
the Biscuits.
For Very Young Children,
crush the Biscuits to a powder,
and, if possible, put through a
very fine sieve. Take a well-
heaped dessert-spoonful of the
powder, and gradually add half
a cupful of boiling water, stirring
at the same time. Then add half
a cupful of fresh milk, and sweeten
to taste. It is the best to first
sterilise the milk by placing a
covered jug or other vessel con-
taining the milk in a pot of
water, and boil for half an hour.
See that all the vessels are kept
scrupulous!}- clean. For Older
children, pour boiling water on
Biscuits as they are, and give by
spoon. A good way is to put a
saucer over the cup or basin in
which the biscuits are placed to
soak, until they swell out, leav-
ing no water. Later on, children
can have them either whole or
soaked, at home or at school.

“Ivy Hill”
Mullumbimby, R.R.
IN immediate proximity to the fast-growing town-
ship of Mullumbimby, on the summit of a gentle
slope across from the public school, half a mile
from the railway station, and centre of the town-
ship, twenty-two miles from Munvillumbah, the chief
town on the Tweed, ten miles from Byron Bay,
and thirty miles from Lismore, on the main road from the
latter place to the Tweed, is found the comfortable home-
stead of Mr. Livingstone, containing 120 acres, fenced,
grassed, and subdivided into ten paddocks, together with
“BURTON NEW CROSS.”
The following particulars are from the Lincoln Red Shorthorn

No. 29. This bull’s sire ("Scampton Expansion”) won
first prize at Royal Show of England, 1904 ; dam, “ Bur-
ton Cross ” is one of the very best cows in the Burton
herd. She won following prizes:—In 1904, 2nd dairy
class, Lincolnshire, beaten by a Burton cow; second in the
Tring milking trial (biggest trial in England) giving
71lbs. 12oz. in 24 hours, 45 cows competing—a Burton
herd cow won; second Shorthorn butter test London
Dairy Show, 20 picked cows competing—Burton herd
cow winning. In 1905 she was second in inspection for
appearance at London Dairy Show, and at same show
2nd for milking and second for all qualities combined. All
these contests were Avon by Burton herd cows. "Pro-
fessor” is the sire of 12 winners of milking trials.
"Young Cherry,” (a full sister to "Burton Cross II”)
was first and challenge cup winner at Belfast, 1904, and
sold for 100 guineas. Her milk yield after first calf was
1042 gals., after second 1446 gals. "Royal Burton” (No.

The Richmond and Tweed Rivers are essentially dairying districts, as has been demonstrated by the numerous butter factories that have
been established, and their large output of butter, both for home consumption and export. Mechanical refrigeration, which has played such a large
part in the meat export trade of Australia, has also become an important feature in the ever increasing butter industry, and now-a-days no butter factory
is considered fully equipped unless it has its refrigerating machine, without which the good quality of the butter cannot be maintained throughout the
most important part of the year, viz., the summer season.
There are various types of refrigerating machines on the market, but would specially draw attention to the " LINDE REFRIGERATING
MACHINE,” which has so largely been adopted for all purposes of refrigeration throughout the Commonwealth, and these machines can be seen operating
in all the principal dairying districts, and readers may have the opportunity of seeing the “LINDE ” at work at the Ballina Co-Operative Dairy Co.,
and the Alstonville Dairy Co. The illustration shown here is similar to the. machine at Ballina.
The LINDE SYSTEM is based on the evaporation of liquid anhydrous ammonia, and the subsequent liquefaction by'mechanical compression
and cooling of the vapour thus formed, so as to enable it to be used over and over again. The mechanical compression is accomplished by means of a
pump driven by any convenient source of power, such as steam engine, oil or gas engine, or electric motor.
The principal parts of the plant consist of ammonia compressor, ammonia condenser, refrigerator coils for use for refrigerating insulated
rooms, cooling water for butter making, and cream cooling, or for making ice.
The ammonia in a liquid state, and under pressure in the condenser is admitted into the refrigerator coils. The pressure in the refrigerator
being lower, the liquid evaporates, absorbing heat at a low temperature and thus cooling the liquid or other medium with which the refrigerator coils
are surrounded, then the ammonia vapour produced hy evaporation passes off at the top, and is drawn into the. compressor, and discharged into the
condenser, under an increased pressure corresponding to the temperature of the water which is being circulated continuously over the condenser coils,
the cooling and increased pressure causing the ammonia to liquefy. Tt then passes through the refrigerator coils to perform the same cycle over again.
All machines on the UNDE SYSTEM are worked in this manner, and are so simple that any ordinary intelligent man can run them satisfactorily.
In addition to dairying, the LINDE Co. lay themselves mT for supplying small LINDE MACHINES specially adapted for use by butchers
and others, where only a small amount of cooling is wanted to meet their requirements.
Intending purchasers of refrigerating machinery should send for catalogue and full particulars of the Linde Machines. The office address is

THE NEW ZEALAND DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, 1902,
reports: —
CALVES,—During the year 9S head have been reared. In addition to the skim-milk from the separ-
ator, on which they have been mainly reared, the calves have received Sunlight Oil Cake mixed with the
milk. This article possesses the great advantage over pollard, oatmeal, oils, and many of the patent
mixtures for calf-rearing, that it does not scour the calves. It dissolves readily in boiling water. Calves
are soon brought to take it, and, after they become fond of it, may be given with advantage from Jib to fib
per calf per diem. When the cake is used with skim-milk individual feeding is best, but where big calves
are fed together in a trough it is necessary to keep on stirring the milk whilst the calves are drinking. Where
thus oil cake is used the calves soon show its good effects by their healthy skins and improving condition.

ALEX. McPHERSON
“GAIRLOCH”
SWAN BAY, R.R.
IN recounting the history of the
Richmond River in its earliest
stages of settlement, the name of
■McPherson will ever figure pro-
minently. being the second per-
son to arrive here from the south
of our capital.. In the early six-
ties, when very little was known
of this great centre of dairying,
he decided to remove from
the South, arriving on this river
in 1565. But not until the hard-
ships and rebuffs of the early
pioneer had been encountered to
the fullest extent did the move
prove successful.
"GAIRLOCH.”
The marvellous change wrought
in “ Gairloch,” since its occupa-
tion by its present owner, seems
incredible: :in place of the wild
and unopened country of the
early days, we find a comfortable
home, big buildings with smoke
stacks, and all the surroundings
of a most highly improved
farm. “ Gairloch” is on the
northern side of the Richmond
River, showing a frontage of two
and a quarter miles on the one
side, and a quarter of a mile on
the other. The area is 780 acres,
principally composed of river
flats, with the exception of the
hilly portion at the back, which

is a valuable acquisition. The property is all cleared and well
grassed, the principal kinds being Paspalum, pi'airie, clover, blue
and Hunter River couch. The place is divided into three good
farms, all worked by Mr. McPherson's sons with splendid results.
They possess a fine herd of dairy cows, the nucleus of which were
brought up from the South Coast some nine years ago, and it
is interesting to see to what dimensions a herd will grow in a
few years, and the profits derived therefrom if intelligently
managed. These cattle are chiefly Milking Shorthorns and Ayr-
shires. The fine, roomy buildings provide more than ample space
for all the requirements of modern dairying—fine hay barn,
large covered calf runs, workshop, dray, buggy and machinery
shed, &c„ the factory and bails being apart from the main
structures. All ocean or river boats call as required at Gair-

ence greatly * appreciated. It might be as well to explain that these large buildings were erected many years ago by Mr.
McPherson as a sugar mill, and"worked as such until recently,, being closed down owing to the unsuitable legislation introduced.
While the mill was working'he utilised 180 acres of this farm for cane growing. A good deal of that same land is now used for
corn growing with much success, this year’s average being 80 bushels to the acre.

FEW men have come more rapidly to the front in the possession
of fine dairy cattle than Mr. J. Watterston, and the fine results
derived from his Jersey and Milking Durham herd clearly demon-
strate to all the paying - qualities these cattle possess. His farm
is a nice little property, with half-a-mile frontage to the Rich-
mond River, fully cleared, well subdivided, and highly grassed.
He has devoted much time and careful thought in stocking it
with some of the best dairy cattle procurable. The pick of this
herd have secured some of the highest honours available, both
in the show ring and under the butter tests, and sell at very high
market rates —clear evidence that it always pays to produce only
the best. Though possessing several grades of cattle, his favourite
breed is the Milking Durham. This farm is well-grassed with
Paspalum, cocksfoot and clover, and the improvements include a
comfortable dwelling and all buildings necessary for modern
dairying.

Sandy Creek, Coraki, R.R.
ON the banks of Sandy Creek
is located the homestead and
farm of Mr. Birmingham. He
has resided here for years, work-
ing hard and toiling long in im-
proving the fine property of
which he is the fortunate owner,
his chief improvement being
the cutting of an important
drain across the lower portion
of the property into the creek.
This renders his magnificent
grass flats capable of carrying a
very large number of stock all
the year round, as -well as pro-

viding very heavy yields of
corn. His crop this year
yielded upwards of 900 bags of
maize, the bulk of it coming
from an at one time apparently
worthless end of the farm, thus
proving the wisdom of the
heavy drain cutting—a good ob-
ject lesson for many sceptics
His original holding consisted
of 218 acres, since increased to
660 acres, the whole of it being
fine grass and agricultural land
suitable alike for grazing and
dairying, and the production of
corn. cane, and pumpkins.
Although devoting a consider-
able portion of his farm to the
production of corn, Mr. Bir-
mingham also maintains a herd
of 83 milk'ng cows, together
with a number of dry cattle and
horses. Having a deep-water
frontage is, of course, a great
acquisition to the property, per-
mitting cream and other items
to be shipped daily to the mar-
ket, besides adding to the com-
fort of living by enabling trad-
ing boats to call daily and de-
liver goods as required. The

AS further evidence of the magnificent opportunities offered to the enterprising, hard-working, steady man, be he local

hope, who plods slowly but surely, who watches the opportune moment and steps into the breach, finds himself slowly but
safely climbing the mountain brow. So with these young men. Coming to the Richmond several years ago they for a time
settled at New Italy, where by working and saving they managed to get a start on Canon Flat—a fine property on the banks
of the Richmond, three miles
from Coraki—buying what cat-

now successfully breeding, rear-

Shoalhaven district, being one of the early
pioneers who settled in the Richmond 40 years
ago. At that time there were no local markets,
and for many years the pioneers had a hard
struggle to keep their heads above water, being
compelled to dispense with all the ordinary luxu-
ries of life. Their industry and perseverance,
however, has been amply repaid, for we now
find Mr. McPherson settled on a fine property of
320 acres all cleared and richly grassed with Paspalum, prairie. couch, clover. &c.. He also owns a splendid herd of cattle con-
taining many prize-winners and butter-test producers of the Dnrham-Ayrshire cross. Mr. McPherson takes a great interest in
horse breeding, drawing a considerable portion of his income from the stock he rears and sells. A fair idea of his draught
sorts may be gained by the accompanying picture of a pair of his favourite plough horses. This property was originally a fine
cane farm, as much as 70 tons to the acre being produced, but it is now devoted chiefly to dairying. Some fine crops of lucerne,
planter, and maize are to be seen, grown principally for fodder. Subdivided into 10 handy paddocks, the farm possesses everything
necessary to ensure the maintenance of an up-to-date daily. The improvements consist of a fine, comfortable homestead,
barns, stables, yards, cow bails, and all modern dairy utensils and machinery. Mr. McPherson was one of the settlers who passed
through the horrors of the 1870 flood, and his experiences during that great crisis prove most interesting and exciting.

NO doubt it would take a good deal to induce the owner of this hue property to part with it. You might easily be
excused for desiring to own it. Skirting the hillside and fronting the grand stream of water known as Cooper’s
Creek, it presents those splendid qualifications which stamp it amongst the many high-class farms of the Richmond
and Tweed. With an area of 284 acres of rich scrub country, including flats that will grow the finest corn, planter or oats,
covered with grasses as fine as
can be grown in any part of the
world, it will be no wonder that
dairying can be made to pay in
this country, especially when it
is taken into consideration what
a wonderful climate and rainfall
are vouchsafed to us. This farm
is under the management of Mr.
Colin McPherson, the youngest
son, who is a very keen judge of

THIS fine herd of cattle was put together by the late Air. Wrn. Bryant (who for very many years past —long before dairy-
ing came to its present position—had been a resident of the Richmond River ), who seized the opportunity, when the
industry began to grow, and using the knowledge gained by all observant men, set himself the task of building up a

herd worthy of the district; and it is'no exaggeration to say he took a very great interest in his work, his herd containing some
very excellent specimens of grade milkers, good to look at and good performers. An excellent grass run and fine fodder-producing
country enabled him, with the assistance of his sons (who, at the same place, still carry on the good work started by their father),
“ROANEY.”
to breed and rear some good
sorts. Seven miles from Lis-
more, on the Boat Harbour
Road, and fronting that grand
stream of water known as Wil-
son’s Creek, one is confronted
with a fine property, carrying
some attractive-looking cattle,
big frames, splendid colours,
typical of what we all like to see
in a large dairying country such
as this, viz., right milking sorts.
The remarkable success which
attended this man’s efforts can
be better understood after spend-
ing a pleasurable hour or two by
profitably studying the various
"TOPSY.”
characteristics of the stock that
go to make up this herd. Though
not a great show man, he has
brought under control a large
number of very high-grade cows
of such a class that no prize-win-
ning exhibitor would need be
ashamed of, and some, perhaps,
could not equal; and it is to this
standard of dairy cattle that the
majority of the Richmond River
fanners are approaching. It in-
dicates the probability of the
future success of the district and
industry, when so high a grade
of heavy milkers is the aim of the
whole community.

this progressive company is making good headway in the midst
of many rivals, must be a matter of congratulation to the dairymen
all over the State, as its aims are not only based on true Co-operative
Lines, but also reach out in maintaining High Quality and Top
Prices, for the most deserving of all men, ” The Producer,” and a glance
through their list of patrons will convince all of the appreciation bestowed
upon them in a very practical fashion. The Butter Factories supporting them
in producing a First-class Article, materially strengthen their position on the
market. The following* is taken from their Twentieth Half Yearly Report,
which states: —“ As evidence of the extension of Co-operative Dairy-
ing in this State, we note the sale and subdivision of large cattle stations on
the Upper Richmond River, and at Kyogle a very large and up-to-date
Factory has been erected, the output of which the directors of that company
have entrusted to your company for sale.- We are again using every effort
to raise ‘ choicest butter’ to its true commercial value, and the prospects of
success are brighter than they have been heretofore, in consequence of the
assistance rendered by Co-operative Factories manufacturing this grade of
butter.” It is certainly clear from the clean above-board methods of this
company, that they are a safe ship to earn* the important consignments
“ placed” in their hands.

“Omagh,” Auctioneer & Cattle Salesman. Kyogle, R.R.
AS a dairyman, farmer and auctioneer, Mr. Alcorn is always
found closely associated with every progressive move tending
to the development of the rapidly-growing town and district of
Kyogle. Few names are more respected, or as long connected
with the fortunes of the Richmond River than that of Alcorn.,
The late father of Mr. R. E. Alcorn conducted a very honourable
and important part in forming and maintaining that wonderful
institution known as the Byron Bay Butter Factory, of which he
was a director from its earliest days to within a month or two
of his death, filling also, for a term, the important post of chair-
man of directors. Mr. R. E. Alcorn has recently been placed
in the position of chairman of directors of the new

“Gowan Brae”
APPROACHING THE HOMESTEAD.
ON a pretty stretch of undulating- country, to the east of the main Tatham-Grafton Road, stands the splendid property “ Gowan
Brae.” It is composed of rich, volcanic soil, highly adaptable to both dairying and cultivation, and intelligently and practi-
cally worked, is capable of most gratifying results. It carries a remarkable growth of its native grass, and also some splendid
paddocks of artificial sorts. Paspalum and Rhodes’ grass, which are being introduced, both grow to a height of two or three feet,
and there is also a fine growth of white clover and prairie grasses. It is remarkable what fine crops of corn, planter and
oats the farm is capable of producing, some of the cornstalks shown bearing two 9-inch cobs, and measuring 16 feet. A paddock
of oats also gives great promise, and another heavy crop of planter being fed out to the cows. As further evidence of the
practical manner in which this farm is worked, a fine area has been securely fenced and ploughed for lucerne, which, by the
way, grows very well here. The whole aspect of the farm is very pleasing to the eye—the comfortable homestead with its big gar-
den enclosure, the well-cleared grass paddocks, the crops in all their different stages of growth and shades of colour, all showing up
in a very pretty relief with each other. “ Gowan Brae” is a fine holding of 800 acres, 200 acres of it being cleared, and the rest
well-timbered country. The whole place is splendidly watered by several permanent springs and dams in convenient places. The
improved portion of the farm is
devoted to dairying and the rest
of the property to breeding and
rearing young stock. An inspec-
tion of the stock would be suffi-
cient to convince anyone that
few holdings possess a finer herd
of young dairy cattle of mixed
grades and colours —all in the
acme of condition. Mr. Harris
hails from the South Coast of
New South Wales, where he
gained a good experience of
dairy farming, and he considers
the soil on “ Gowan Brae” very
much the same as some of the
most celebrated parts down

WHAT a comparison, thirty years ago, when
this property first came into possession of the
Saville family, and to-day! How things have
changed, how the} - have progressed, how the
order of the new covers up the face of the
old. The existence of those bygone days seems hard
to trace. How the sturdy old pioneer had to rough
it, back in the solitude of the bush—no roads, no con-
veniences, no markets. It's a life-long wonder to
those of us who stop to think and who have come after
them. We find now, roads, railways, stores (em-
poriums. we might call them), sawmills, brick yards,
and, in fact, everything the heart can wish for or the
pocket procure; and when you see the fine type of old

An educational, as well as a commercial institution, is the
Alstonville Co-operative Refrigerating Company, situated a few
minutes' walk from the centre of the village. Originally the
property of the old New South Wales Creamery Co., Ltd., this
hue property has now been purchased by the farmers them-
selves, and it is almost unnecessary to make mention of the
success achieved by this company at all the great shows foi the
exhibition of butter. Alstonville may lay claim to produce one
of the best samples of butter known anywhere.
As a beauty spot, the village and surrounding country are well
known, and visitors can at all times be prepared for a varied and
charming tour in almost any direction.
The State Experimental Farm, situated at Wollongbar, about
four miles from Alstonville, is available at any time for farmers and
others interested, and it is needless to state that both the farm
and the local Agricultural Society are working together for the
general good.

THE pretty village of Alstonville is situated midway between
the seaport town of Ballfna and the important town of Lismore.
For a great number of years past the Agricultural Society has
made itself conspicuous by the good work performed by its
energetic body of workers, not only the holding of an annual
exhibition, but by other means of an educational character. The
society recognises that the functions of a body such as the Agri-
cultural Society, does not begin and end with its show, and
during the interim the best efforts are put forward to help
all classes of members, from the school child to the aged farmer.
In this way the members are brought constantly in touch, and a
good feeling prevails in all quarters.

butter factories are a great convenience to the

Co-operation as applied to the marketing of Dairy and other Produce.
QUARTER of a century ago, the lot of the dairy farmer
was, indeed, a very sorry one. The produce of his labour
was oftentimes treated and sold as though he- had not
the slightest interest in it. and his welfare so seldom
entered into the consideration of his selling agent, that
he more often than otherwise received scant payment for his
labours.
But about that time a few of the dairy fanners of the South
met together to consider the advisability and arrange for the
selling of their produce, the outcome of which was the formation
of a co-operative society, known as the South Coast
and West Camden Co-operative Society. They had not
the least idea at that time to what magnitude their
efforts would lead. However, the result of handling their
own products bore such good fruit that the effect upon the
dairying industry was magical, and resulted in an extensive
production of butter, cheese, and bacon. So prosperous did the
Agency become, that it was soon found that much more commo-
dious and extensive premises were requisite to satisfactorily con-
duct the society’s business: and a few years only from the date
of opening saw the foundation laid and the present handsome pile
of buildings erected; an ornament to Sussex Street, a monument
to the indomitable courage and perseverance of these pioneers
of the industry. The accompanying illustration faithfully por-
trays this splendid edifice, and conveys a vivid idea of the volume
of business conducted within its walls.
The South Coast and West Camden, like many other pioneer
societies, had, its vicissitudes, resulting in one or more changes
in its title. The present F. and 3. Co-operative Society is, how-
ever, the outcome of the parent association, and, with their pre-
decessors, have successfully represented co-operative marketing
of dairv produce extending over a quarter of a century, and
reckons amongst its supporters to-day the majority of its found-
ers that are living. As will be seen from the additional plates
on this page, the Society has extended its operations to several
inland cities, thereby giving its numerous suppliers and consignees
the benefit of the inland markets as -well as the metropolitan, and
that its influence is strong and evergrowing; extending to other
branches, is exemplified in the figures given below ; and that its
influence for good is now being demonstrated to the wheat-
grower and stock owner, proves that the old house has by no
means lost its usefulness, and is ever ready to extend the benefits
of co-operation to ALL MEN ON THE LAND. With the ever
extending benefits of co-operative marketing, and the steady and
gradual eliminations of the middleman, the future of the N.S.W.
farmer is much more promising and hopeful; and the day is not
far distant when he will be able to point, with pride and gratitude,
to the author of their good fortunes, the F. and S. Co-operative-
Society.
_ A few reasons why you should support the F. and S. Co-opera-
tive Society;—
Because their charges are the lowest.
Because they have branches and agencies in all the principal
towns, and necessarily the largest outlets for all farm produce.
Because they have expert salesmen in everv department.
Because they make liberal advances.
Because the}- give free storage for wheat.
Because the}' know how to handle produce to the best
advantage.
Because their success means your success; therefore, do the
correct thing and adopt Co-operative Marketing.

Richard Dawes,
“ Maybrook”
Eltham, R.R.
WHAT is generally admitted to be one of the
prettiest homes on the Rivers, conveniently situa-
ted, easily accessible, and very comfortable, is
the above property, consisting of 200 acres. The
soil is of the highest standard, and the gentle,
undulating formation of the land permits the
whole of it being ploughed, with, perhaps, the
exception of 10 acres, The farm is subdivided
into sixteen small paddocks, and possesses an
everlasting supply of water. Among the im-
provements is the handsome homestead, comfort-
able and well-arranged, on the rise of the farm
between the main Lismore-Pearce’s Creek Road
and the railway line, which intersects the pro-
perty- The farm is connected with Lismore by a
fine macadamized road n miles in length, and is in
“MAYBROOK HOUSE,” looking west.

Railway Station, which is but

School and village of Eltham

vantages proving how excellent
a property Mr. Dawes possesses.
Coming here from the South
Coast 19 years ago, he pur-
chased this farm, then almost
completely covered with the

ing a striking contrast to the surrounding well-cleared, grassy
slopes and ridges. The fine old homestead, which want of room
alone prevents being illustrated, is the residence of Mr. George
Dawes, who works “Maybrook;” it stands as a monument of past
effort, and tells the tale of labour past and progress made. Another
fine dairying property of 130 acres is situated on Cooper’s Creek,
and is known as “ Hill View.” Mr. Dawes secured this property
for his son George, and here again some very excellent results
are gained. The breed of cattle most approved of are the Illa-
warra type of milkers, and some very fine grades are to be seen
on both farms.

e ROB ABLY the finest object lesson in Co-opera-
tion is to be found in this mammoth Butter
L concern, so sincere in its objects, high in its
aspirations, and far reaching that it has drawn to it-
self, throughout the length and breadth of the Rich-
mond and Tweed, the vital support so essential to its
very existence, with the result that its output has so
increased as to become phenomenal. The quality of its
butter is so excellent that its name is now a household
word, and its future assured—so much so, as to be envied by the many other excellent, though lesser, similar concerns throughout
the Australian Commonwealth. Of course this has not come about without great efforts on the part of those who started this grand idea a
few years ago, and it also has only been maintained by the intelligent management of its earnest shareholders, practical
Directors, energetic Secretary, and methodical and capable Manager—a combination of essentials that the Richmond and Tweed Rivers
district can ever be thankful that it possessed. The Co-operative Company fought the Proprietary Companies inch b} r inch, overcame great
difficulties, surmounted huge obstacles, and forged ahead, and to-day we see it, after the lapse of but ten years, perhaps the biggest concern
of its kind in the dairying co-operative centres of the world. Its famous brands of “ Unara ” and “ North Coast ” butters stand high in the-

are doing their share in adver-
tising Australia, the butter
industry in general, and this

headed by the North Coast

is keeping up its end of the

“Willow Vale ”
THIS property is well-named on account of the wonderful growth of willow trees that follow the course of the streams which so
bountifully water the place, and afford such welcome shade. One needs to visit this farm to get a true conception of what progres-
sive dairying is like. While there are many hundreds of first-class dairy farms to be found on the Richmond and Tweed Rivers,
farmers with fine laud, excellent situation, choice herds, superiorgrasses, modern appliances, and practical knowledge, &c., yet
“Willow Vale” can compare favourably with them all. and a visit to the farm will prove most instructive to those eager to learn
practical dairying. Coming from Berrima 7 years ago—a district renowned for its dairying—and where they were provided with
farming experience from boyhood, Messrs. Hunter Bros, purchased “Willow Vale” and “Huntersville,” and have since transformed
them into two ideal farms stocked with the finest cattle that money could buy. Messrs. J. R. and F. Hunter manage “Willow Vale,”

of the “ Big Scrub” country, but is now cleared and heavily grassed with prairie, couch and clover. It is subdivided into 12
paddocks, and is highly improved. It possesses a comfortable homestead, and the finest bails on the Northern Rivers, the latter
alone being well worthy of inspection. The bails consist of stalls, well-housed and carefully concreted, and have a passage running
the whole length of the structure, which is equally well floored with the same material. There is also a separator house, and
one of the best bull paddocks to be seen anywhere. Cooper’s Creek provides it with one mile of water frontage, and another
creek running through the centre of the property ensures a never-failing supply of water. ‘‘Huntersville,” a mile further along the

IT could safely be said by anyone looking over this herd of cattle that a good foundation has been laid for the future, and this
impression would be much strengthened by even a cursory glance at the young stock. Mr. Edwards, who resides at the Eureka
Post Office, is in the centre of a very fine dairying country, and with magnificent feed, water and shade is losing no oppor-
tunity to secure thereby the best results. Amongst his milkers he has a large number of very fine grade cows, excellent
milkers, and good breeders. When you see what Mr. Edwards, with the steady assistance of his sons, has done in the few

huge forests and impenetrable
scrubs they were familiar with,
nothing remains except a few

the rest having to give place to

The fine roads, bridges, postal,

since sprung up, all bear tribute
to the tireless energy and perse-

pioneers, who thus transformed
a wilderness into a garden of
prosperity.

THIS is generally considered one of the best farms on the Richmond River, and although this is a bold assertion, it is certainly
one that is borne out bv the results produced. The farm is 200 acres in extent, 180 of which consist of splendid alluvial
flats —ground that cannot be beaten anywhere. After many years cultivation it still yields the splendid crop of 70 bushels
to the acre. It possesses magnificent pastures, all sorts of choice grasses being cultivated, Paspalum, prairie and clover especially so.
There is a splendid herd of cattle grazing on the farm, the principal breeds being Durham and Durham-Ayrshire cross. The
property is abundantly watered by small streams, and possesses a frontage of one mile to the fine stream of Cooper’s Creek. The

THERE can be no doubt that a very large percentage of the Richmond River residents have come from the South Coast
of New South Wales, the original hot-bed of dairying and home of high-grade milking cattle. Their bringing with them
that keen knowledge gained by wide experience, is in no small degree attributable to the high position in the
butter world that it is the proud privilege of these rivers to occupy. Amongst the names of cattlemen on the South Coast
few could be found better known than that of the subject of this sketch, who. in season and out of season, was always ;found

IT would require more space than at our disposal
to describe in detail this splendid farm, so we
will content ourselves by running over the pro-
perty in a general way and give our readers some
of the especial points of interest. This handsome
property is one of the finest all-round dairy farms
in the country. All the necessary elements for
the successful management of a farm are to be
found here. It has an abundance of water,
fine flats, timber ridges, &c., grows splendid
crops of make, and possesses a marvellous
growth of Paspalmn. The homestead is almost
hidden with foliage, and has a pretty garden
with trees, ferns, and plants in abundance, also
has fine commodious out-buildings. This pro-
perty fronts Goolmangar Creek, one of the main
tributaries of the Richmond, and is nine miles

“MARLIVALE” Homestead.
Residence of Tenant. —Working “Marlivale” head farm (300

Mr. Mclntyre did not start his improvements on
the farm till 1882. He then settled down to the
long work of clearing, gradually increasing the
improved area, until one finds to-day a grand
farm of 600 acres, all highly improved and splen-
didly settled, and posessing three fine homesteads.
When milking is in full swing Mr. Mclntyre
has a herd of 200 choice dairy cows. The whole
of the buildings are carefully built, only picked
hardwood timber being employed, and are mostly
erected on stone foundations with concrete floors.
The big, roomy factory has a steam dairy plant
costing £4OO, and draws its water supply from a
fine underground tank holding 24,000 gallons.
The system of subdividing the farm is excellent,
the whole of the 25 paddocks having water,
mostly running streams. The chief strains of
cattle are as here depicted. The results obtained
from the old “ Major” Durham milking strain,
with the cross of the Devon, are highly satisfac-
tory, some of the cows when in good milk testing-
up to 6. Horses are bred with success, for
both'in and out of the show ring, some hand-
some types being now on view on the farm. Pigs
are gone in for largely, principally the Berkshire,
though Mr. Mclntyre is at present experimenting
with the Tam worth strain. All corn and hay
used is grown on the farm, as well as a splendid
supply of vegetables.

VISITORS travelling on the mail route from Ballina to Lismore are struck with the pretty homestead of “ Westbridge Villa,”
with its long well-formed stairway of concrete leading no to the crest of the hill at the loot of the mountain, where
the homestead is situated. " Westbridge Villa,” the home of Mr. Wickham, is replete with all modern conveniences, all
necessary out-buildings, manager's and tenants’ residences, bails, factory, sawbench. stables, coachhouse, bull paddocks, well-housed
piggeries, systematic poultry runs, extensive brick silo, &c., and the homestead is provided with all modern comforts, septic tank,

system possible. So correct and practical are accounts kept that the quantity of milk and test of butter are daily available,
enabling the owner to decide at any moment the advisability of increasing or decreasing his herd. This estate is situated on the navi-
gable water of Emigrant Creek, and has a water frontage of six and a half miles. It is well grassed with Paspalum dilatatum, and
many choice English grasses admirably suited for the rearing of young stock, and providing the best milk returns. The class
of cattle kept at “ Westbridge" are of the highest order, and embrace some magnificent strains. Mr. Wickham favours the

in the Milking Shorthorn Herd Book of New South Wales. Some fine horses are bred on this estate, and a good strain of bacon
pigs are very successfully reared. Mr. Wickham is especially interested in poultry, and possesses some fine poultry pens, which
contain many beautiful birds. Altogether the stock, the many fine improvements, and the various grasses and crops grown on
this property constitute one of the most interesting combinations to be found in any part of this great dairying centre of New
South Wales.

Ed. Boyle,
"Tyrone"
Bangalow, R.R.
HAILING from Jamberoo, on
the South Coast of New South
Wales, where all his younger
days were spent, Mr. Boyle ar-
rived here in 1881, and selected
in the deep scrub of Bangalow.
High up on the brow of the hills
is found the homestead, over-
looking the sea, and gradually
receding down to the banks of
three permanent creeks is the
fine farm, “ Tyrone.” Here, in
the early days, he worked and
cleared and grassed, and we find
to-day a fine up-to-date home-
stead with necessary outbuild-
ings and stock that do honour to
their founder. Mr. Boyle took
an active interest in the district,
and was one of the first mem-
bers of the original Byron Bay
Progress Association, and first
president of the Bangalow A.
and I. Society, holding that posi-
tion for five years, when he re-
tired. Mr. Boyle was further
appointed one of the first pro-
visional councillors of the Byron
Shire. Before a jetty was erec-
ted at Byron Bay he had to ship

and Byron Bay-Lismore Roads, contains 320 acres, all grassed with artificial grasses and divided into many paddocks, and is three
miles from Bangalow township, one mile from St. Helena Railway Station, six miles from Byron Bay, and 24 miles from Lis- ,
more. All the time Mr. Boyle has been here he has been adding to his herd a fine type of cattle, with the result that he is able

also possesses several never-fail-

Thoroughly up-to-date bails and splendidly drained yards.
A grand trio of workers.
IN reviewing the past history of
this property, one must go back
to the very early settlement of
the River. The father of the
present owner, the late Mr. John
Riordan, came from the Shoal-
haven and selected this farm in
1866, now 40 years ago. Situa-
ted on the eastern side of the
north arm of the Richmond
River, which provides it with a
and south arms of the Richmond, and the great
stock loading depot of the N.C.S.N. Company,
eight miles distant. The property consists of 50c
acres, and is divided into numerous paddocks
still further watered by a creek. The improve-
ments are of a very substantial order —the large
modern and well-situated bails, barn, stables, pig-
geries, and tip-top steam plant, and 400 gallon
separator, &c., the last-named greatly minimis-
ing the work in the dairy. The homestead is
very comfortable, and is nicely situated on the
river bank. The principal crop now grown is
corn, usually 40 acres being planted, and the
average yield is 40 bushels, which is shipped to
Sydney. The whole farm is laid down in grasses,
principally Paspalum, prairie, and lambs’ tongue.
Mr. Riordan at present is milking go cows,
the chief types being Ayrshire, Durham, and Jer-
sey cross. The cream is sent to the Coraki Butter
Factory (of which Mr. Riordan is a shareholder)
by one of the cream boats. The late Mr. John
Riordan, together with the late Mr. Herman,
were amongst the first growers of cane here, the
two of them experimenting in the manufacture of
sugar as far back as 1868. Their method was to
chaff the cane with a tomahawk and then boil it
down in a pot, but owing to their adding too
much lime their experiments proved unsuccess-
ful for some time. Eric, the eldest son of Mr. J.

“ Wyangarie,” on the Upper Richmond River,
on one of its important tributaries (Lynch’s

fortunate in securing- such splendid country; the
selection comprising 400 acres, and a leasehold of
a further 300 acres, consisting of big scrub coun-
try fringed with open forest.


"GLENCOE ESTATE,"
IMMEDIATELY adjoining the property of his
brother Charles, and favoured by the same con-
ditions, Glencoe” is indeed a pleasing pro-
perty. After very many years of experience in
this part of the country (he being a native of
the Richmond River) Air. Yabsley, 25 years ago,
chose “ Glencoe” as his future home, and the
wisdom of that choice is now apparent. The
farm is conveniently situated 18 miles from the
township and Railway Station of Casino, 20 miles
from Lismore, and five miles from Coraki —the
port of call visited by all the ocean going boats
of the North Coast Steam Navigation Company,

K TOW that advertising is playing so important a part in the wake
* ' of modern progress, and good blocks form the chief attraction
of all correct displays, it is worth considering where you can
get the best blocks possible to be made. Whilst on these thoughts
it is well to know that there are no better block makers than
the ELECTRIC PHOTO. ENGRAVING CO., and though their work is
absolutely the best that can be produced by most modern
machinery and highest skilled labour, the prices are positively
the lowest compatible with first-class work. As a proof of the
superiority of their work one need only peruse this book, which
contains upwards of 800 blocks, approximating 8,600 square inches,
the whole of which were made by the Electric Photo. Engraving Co.,
