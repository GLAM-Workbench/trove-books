FIVE NUTS TO CRACK
By J. A. HOBSON, Economist and Author of International Repute.
Mr. J. A. Hobson, writing in the ? Nation,? puts forward the following five propositions:?
(1) The Allies cannot by any force of arms so crush and permanently hold down Germany as to
disable her from recovering military strength if she should set herself to this task. She will still possess great
resources of trained soldiers, and the science, discipline, patriotism, and other qualities and properties which
make a nation formidable if a warlike purpose still inspires their use.
(2) 77ie consistent and prolonged attempt of the Allies to prevent such recovery by force would keep
militarism and conscription, with all their costs and perils, enthroned in this c
(3) Such a policy would preserve the militarist power in Germany. For it would enable the Govern-
ment to say to their people: ?You see how right we were in telling you that a conspiracy of jealous and
revengeful nations were bent upon breaking up your empire and dismembering it, stealing your colonies, and
crippling your commercial development. By dint of heer numbers they have succeeded for the present. But
let us bide our time.?
(4) Thus Germany would not be broken of her militarism, but would devote herself persistently to
intriguing for allies, and plotting a war of revenge.
(5) By such a sequel would be destroyed every hope of that concert of Europe which Mr. Asquith,
Sir Edward Grey, and others of our statesmen have announced as the indispensable condition for a pacific future.
I beg no question as to the possibility of averting these perils by means of a more genuinely conclusive
peace, the product of a more reasonable process of negotiation and consent. Ido not know whether Germany
will have the wisdom to propose any settlement on terms to which we and our Allies can or ought to agree. I
only plead that should such proposals be made, they should not be ruled out of consideration by advocates of a
War of attrition.
In conclusion, may I express my surprise at the passionate indignation with which so many persons lash
themselves when any suggestion of the possibility of an early and what, by a question-begging epithet, they
term ?an inconclusive peace ? is mooted? It looks as if they w
like dumb-driven cattle to the slaughter, might turn upon their rulers and insist that those who had got them into
this bloody business should get them out of it. Otherwise, why this anger directed against a mere contemptible
handful of persons who, like myself, question the value, the necessity, and the meaning of ? fighting to a finish ?
If, as they contend, the allied peoples are solidly behind their Governments in a stern insistence upon refusing
to consider any suggestions for settlement until the process of attrition is completed, and terms can be dictated
to a crushed Germany, why this scorn and anger directed against those who impotently raise the possibility of
an earlier and securer peace?
