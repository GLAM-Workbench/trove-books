THE SPLERDID EX-ROYAL MAIL PACKET "BEN NEVIS."
From the “Liverpool Australian Gazette.”
This noble and justly celebrated Clipper, now put on the berth for the fourth time for Melbourne, has already made her-
self famous, not only for the general satisfaction given to all Passengers who have embarked in her, the general complete-
ness of her equipments, but also as being the Pioneer of that noble Fleet of Royal Mail Clippers sailing under the
“ WHITE STAR” flag. On her last passage home from Melbourne she beat several of the fastest ships afloat, and may be
expected on her present voyage to keep up the high character of this line for speed. The “ BEN NEVIS” is essentially a
first-class Emigrant Ship, and was built and altogether laid out under the superintendence of her late active Commandei,
Captain Herron, whose long experience in this trade especially qualified him to know what was necessary both for the
health and comfort of a large number of Passengers. Her Main Deck offers a long clear space of 280 feet, by nearly 40
feet wide, for promenade, an advantage seldom found on any ship, and of incalculable importance as respects health to
Passengers confined for nearly three months on shipboard.
Her Saloons are handsomely fitted, and furnished with Bedding and all that is necessary for the comfort and
convenience of those intending to go in that class. Her various Commanders have on all occasions received the thanks
and acknowledgments of their Passengers "of every class.
Amongst the many testimonials given to her late Commander, we insert the following
