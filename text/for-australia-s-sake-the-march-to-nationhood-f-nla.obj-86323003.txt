It behoves the workers and all other
friends of Labor to closely examine the divi-
sions now printed and to keep them for refer-
ence, because a general election is bound to
take place in 1911, or in the first two months
of 1912. The subjects of the votes comprise
Electoral Reform, Land Tax, Factories
Legislation, and the Minimum Wage. In the
Land Tax the Murray Government turned
around to the Tories and big land-owners in
reducing its tax from |d. to Jd., while it
showed no concern whatever for the very
small holder, by reducing the exemption from
A5OO to In its Factories legislation it
introduced the separate Country Wages
Boards, and admitted it did it for the purpose
of making the wages of country workers
lower than those of the city. As for its Elec-
toral Reform, it is hardly worthy of the
name, oa“much as the Legislative Council is
in complete dominance over the Victorian
legislature.

The document was a somewhat elaborate
commentary on some of the defects of our

sage bears on this very power over trade and
commerce, and it says that the Commonwealth
Constitution “bisects” the control in a man-
ner which South Africa would do well to
avoid. This showed that in 1908 Mr. Groom

“No man ventured to say ten years ago
that the Federal fundamental law had any
pretensions to being more than a tentative
measure On the contrary, it was well po-
vided with the means of effecting its own
amendment, making the people the arbiters
in every case of what that amendment should
be. Mr. Sampson’s short speech yesterday
running over these facts and examining the
need that THE NATION, AND NOT THE
STATES, SHOULD GOVERN OUR IN-
DUSTRIAL CONDITIONS, was a weighty
contribution to the debate. He was felicitious
in saying that those who oppose the granting
of more power to the Commonwealth in deal-
ing with trade and commerce and industry
virtually affirm that the Federal Parliament
cannot be trusted to exercise those functions
and that such powers are safer in the hands
of the States. Mr. Deakin contends that no
national Parliament can take proper cognis-
ance of industrial conditions in a country so
wide in area as Australia, where one part is
in the tropics and another on the confines of
the temperate and frigid zones. But, as Mr.
Sampson pointed out, the State of Western
Australia embraces all those extremes, and no
-one has yet affirmed the inability of that State
to regulate the wages of its workmen or the
conditions of its trade.”

“The clause now proposed, as has been
said, IS THE SAME IN EFFECT AS THAT
WHICH WAS CARRIED INTO LAW IN
1904, WHEN IT PLACED THE RAILWAY
SERVANTS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF
THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT. The
law was declared ultra vires by the High
Court, and it is this which is now sought to
be amended, so that in giving to a Federal
Court the right to deal with industrial dis-
putes the power would be quite plenary in
all branches of labor. Sir William Lyne
asked, “Why should not railway men have
the same rights and privileges all over Aus-
tralia as other workmen have?” There may
be 500,000 workers who will come under the
cognisance of the Federal Courts. ON
WHAT GROUNDS SHOULD RAILWAY
SERVANTS BE EXCLUDED? TO SAY
THAT BECAUSE THE STATE PAYS THE
SALARIES IT MUST HAVE THE RIGHT
TO PRESCRIBE THE CONDITIONS OF
SERVICE IS CONTRARY TO THE VERY
PRINCIPLE THAT GUIDES ALL INDUS-
TRIAL LEGISLATION. Mineowners pay
miners’ wages, factory-owners pay the wages
of factory hands, contractors pay the wages
of artisans and builders, but none of these
employers have the power of fixing the rates
of pay and the conditions of labor. The
State would merely stand in the same posi-
tion as any other great employer. The Fede-
ral Courts would decide disputes, and pre-
vent the recurrence of strikes by the strong
hand.”
(“Age,” October 21, 1910.)
“MOREOVER, CONCERNING THE
ALLEGATIONS THAT THESE INDUS-
TRIAL POWERS ARE TOO LARGE TO
GIVE TO THE COMMONWEALTH, IT
IS ENOUGH TO ANSWER THAT EVERY
FEDERATION IN THE WORLD POS-
SESSES THEM SAVE AMERICA AND
AUSTRALIA. AND WHAT IS MORE,
THERE IS NO OTHER FEDERATION IN
WHICH THE NATIONAL POWERS ARE
SO LIMITED AS THEY ARE IN THIS
COMMONWEALTH. . . . Mr. Sampson re-
minded his leader that the present Referen-
dum Bills do not materially differ from the
measure which Mr. Deakin formerly pro
posed, and he showed by quotations from the
evidence of Sir Edmund Barton and Sir Wil-
liam McMillan that both these leaders had
foreseen and predicted the very reforms now
proposed in the Ministerial measures.
