much property destroyed, and many slaves set at liberty. It
brought accounts of famine in the upper part of Soudan, war in
Bambara, and other fearful-sounding tales. I would listen to
none ; but, alas ! my people would, and no persuasions could get
them to start: all was stopped. I now determined upon going
to the tents of the Dummanies, and trying what could be done with
them, or the people of Akka, but 1 regret to say with no better
success.
? It is decided that I had better remain here for two months, as
the war that has resulted from the attack on the Cafila has set all
the tribes at variance ; no day has passed for the last fortnight
without some engagement, the places are filled with wounded, I
have to attend them all, and hope at last I shall make friends
enough to carry my point successfully. Sheik Beyrook tells me
that my detention here will not cause any delay in getting through
the country: the only difference is, that lam stopping here during
the rainy season, in which no one can travel in Soudan, instead of
in the tents of the Dummanies. By the Ist of October at latest
I hope to have actually started on my journey.?
Vlll. ?Latest Accounts from Australia.
No very recent accounts of the progress of discovery in Aus-
tralia have reached this country since the Surveyor-General Major
Mitchell?s official letter, addressed to the Colonial Secretary, de-
tailing the circumstance of his excursion to explore the course of
the Darling, behind the colony of New South Wales. This letter
has also a painful interest attached to it, as relating the melancholy
loss of Mr. Cunningham, the Colonial Botanist, who wandered
from tl\e party on the 17th April, 1835, and has not since been
heard of.
? Camp, West of Harvey's Range ,
4 th September, 1835.
? Sir, ? I have the honour to submit, for the information of his
Excellency the Governor, the following report of the progress of the
party, and result of the expedition, which his Excellency was pleased
to place under my command, for the purpose of exploring the course
of the river Darling.
? Having joined this party at Buree on the sth of April, I recon-
noitred the country on the following day; and on the 7th we pro-
ceeded, by a route not hitherto explored, to that part of the Darling
specified in my instructions. My plan was to proceed along the high
ground between the rivers Lachlan and Macquarie; and which ex-
tended farther into the interior than had been explored. Thus I hoped
to avoid the necessity for crossing any rivers, or incurring any risk of


delay from floods, such as those which formerly, at the same season of
the year, impeded the progress of the late Surveyor-General. Another
object I had in view in choosing this route was, to extend my trigono-
metrical survey as far as possible along these heights into the interior.
?By this line we reached the river Darling, near the junction of
New Year?s Creek, in thirty-one days? travelling from Buree; having
found the country so favourable that it was never necessary to unload
a dray or cut a way through scrub, or to pass a night without water.
On my right I had the waters of the Bogan, and on my left a con-
nected chain of heights, whereof New Year?s Range is the last.
? But a grievous misfortune befel the expedition in the loss of Mr.
Cunningham, the Colonial Botanist, who wandered from the party
near the head of the river Bogan on the 17th of April. After an
anxious search, continued for twelve days, during which the party
halted, his horse was traced till found dead, having still the saddle
on, and the bridle in its mouth. It appeared that Mr. Cunningham,
. after losing his horse, had directed his own steps northward ; we
traced them into the Bogan, and westward along the bed of that
river for twenty miles, and until they disappeared near a recent en-
campment of natives. There a small portion of the skirt of his coat
was found, also some fragments of a map which I had seen in his
possession. There were two distinct tribes of natives on the Bogan ;
but from those with whom we had communication we could learn
nothing of his fate. I have ever since indulged a hope that he might
have crossed to the Macquarie, and so returned to the settled districts;
but this hope has not relieved me much from the most painful appre-
hensions, considering the disposition of the natives. Whether Mr.
Cunningham really survives or not, his absence has made a melancholy
blank in our party, and has certainly caused a serious loss to science.
? We found the interior country parched by such excessive drought,
that the swamp under Oxley?s Table-Land, mentioned by Captain
Sturt, was completely dry, and only a few ponds remained in the river
Bogan (which is the New Year?s Creek of that traveller). Indeed, for
300 miles below that creek we drank no other water than that of the
Darling. In this river there was a slight current, the quantity flowing-
in rapids being about as much as might be required to turn a mill.
The water was in all parts as transparent as that of the purest spring
well ; and it entirely lost all brackish taste below an extreme point of
Dunlop?s Range, where a hill consisting of a very hard breccia closes
on the river so as to separate the plains above it from those lower
down. The taste of the water was worst where the river is nearest
to D?Urban?s Group: above that, at the junction of New Year?s
Creek, and for seventeen miles from thence downwards, it was ex-
cellent.
? When the party first arrived on the Darling, I was induced, from
the favourable appearance of the reaches, to try at what rate I might
proceed on the river with the boats. It was necessary to rest and
refresh the cattle after so long a journey, even had I possessed no other
means of proceeding farther. That part of the river bank which I


fixed on for the depot is situated about twelve miles below the junction
of New Year?s Creek ; the position was naturally good, overhanging
the river, and commanding a good run for the cattle ; but I strength-
ened it as a place of defence against the natives, by cutting down the
few trees on it, and erecting a block-house large enough to contain all
our stores and equipment.
?On the Ist of June (the sixth day after our arrival) I proceeded
down the river in the boats, with the greater portion of the party ; and
on the following day we returned to the fort, having found too many
shallow and rocky places in the river to admit of our making such
progress as was necessary to enable us to accomplish the object of the
expedition.
? Having next ascertained, by a reconnoissance I made as far as
Dunlop?s Range, with a party on horseback, that the water below was
good, and the country not unfavourable to our further journey by
land, we evacuated the depot on the Bth of June (the cattle having
then rested two weeks) and proceeded along the left bank of the
Darling.
?As the cattle became weaker, the country, as we descended, be-
came much more difficult for them to travel upon. It consisted chiefly
of plains of naked earth too soft to retain roots, yet just tenacious
enough to open in deep cracks, across which it was not always safe
to ride. Impassable hollows (covered with Polygonum juncium ) at
length skirted the river so extensively, that we could seldom encamp
within a mile of it, and sometimes not within three. Still we could
not have existed there without the river, which contained the only
water, and had on its banks the only grass _ for our cattle; conse-
quently it was necessary to send a separate party to remain with the
cattle at the river, generally in the presence of natives, and it required
the utmost vigilance on the part of these men every night to prevent
cattle getting bogged in the soft mud of the banks.
? I had proceeded thus about 300 miles down the Darling, when
the weakness of the bullocks, and the reduced state of our provisions,
obliged me to consider the expediency of going forward with a small
party only, and at a faster rate, while the exhausted cattle might, in
the mean time, be refreshing for the homeward journey. But before
deciding on the separation of the party, in the presence of several
powerful tribes of natives, I halted it to rest the animals, while some
preparations were going forward for setting out. In two days I was
convinced, from the movements I observed amongst the native tribes,
that in proceeding farther at so great a risk of compromising the
safety of the stationary party, I should have acted contrary to the
9th Article of his Excellency?s instructions, and thereupon I aban-
doned the intention.
??The track of our drays had formed a road, which was much easier
for the cattle in returning, so that b*y short marches, and occasional
rests, while I explored the country on each side, we reached the
former depot on the 10th of August, having lost only six of the bul-


locks, these having either got fast in the mud of the river, or lain down
exhausted and unable again to rise.
? The interior of the country, westward of the Darling, is diversified
with detached groups of hills, and low ranges broken into portions
resembling islands ; but the general aspect thereof afforded no indi-
cation of its having then any water on its surface. From two different
hills, each about twelve miles west of the Darling, and distant from
each other about seventy miles, I obtained extensive views across the
country j but from neither of these heights could I perceive any
smoke, or even any appearance of trees, the whole country being
covered with one kind of bush, forming a thick scrub, with intervals
rather more open, but strewed with smaller bushes. During the four
?winter months just passed, no clouds gathered to any particular point
of that horizon : no rain has fallen, neither has there been any dew,
and the winds from the west and north-west, hot and parching, seemed
to blow over a region in which no humidity remained.
? The Darling did not, in a course of 300 miles, receive a single
river or chain of ponds from either side. Such was the extent of the
plains on its banks, and the depth and absorbent quality of the soil,
that much of the waters of high floods appear to be retained therein,
besides all the drainage from the back country. Thus the springs
appear to be supplied, by which the river is sustained during the
present season of drought. These absorbent plains extend to about
five miles, on an average, from the river on each side; hills of soft
red sand bound them, and recede about three miles farther. Undu-
lations of diluvial gravel (of a very hard siliceous breccia) succeed,
and skirt the base of the heights, which generally consist of primary
sandstone.
? The country eastward of the river rises gradually backwards to-
wards the hills, by which I advanced to the Darling. There the
higher grounds are more connected, and send down chains of ponds,
which appear to be absorbed in the plains. The same kind of bush,
however, covers the first region of high ground back from the Darling
on both sides ; and the character of features, and direction of valleys,
were not very apparent from heights near this river.
? The general course of the Darling, as far as I had explored it (which
Avas to the latitude of the head of Spencer?s Gulf), is somewhat to the
west of south-west (variation 8� 27'). This would tend to the west-
ward of the head of Gulf St. Vincent, if the longitude of the Upper
Darling were correct: but I make the longitude of that river, on the
parallel of 30� S., nearly a degree more to the eastward; and from
that longitude the general course tends much more nearly towards
the supposed junction below, although still considerably to the west
of that point, as laid down on maps.
? Having measured the whole of our route, and surveyed the
country, as I proceeded, in continuation of my general survey of the
colony, I had thereby the means of ascertaining the longitude of
points connected therewith. Thus I place?


Lat. S. Long, E,
New Year?s Range (clear hill) in 30� 27' 4,5" 146� 53' 00''
Oxley?s Table-Land (south side) 30 11 15 145 16 9
DTJrban?s Group (high south hill) 30 34 40 145 43 30
Fort Bourke . . . 30 7 4 145 52 12
The last mentioned, being an important station, accessible at all
seasons by the line of the Bogan, and available for carrying the survey
into the more remote country, I have taken the liberty to distinguish
with the name of his Excellency the Governor, under whose orders
the survey of the colony has been connected with the geography of
the interior.
? From Fort Bourke I continued the survey of the Darling, by actual
measurement, corrected by intersecting distant points, and also by
observations of latitude, to the termination of my journey in latitude
32� 24' 20" S. ; and I make the longitude of that point, as deduced
from this survey, 142� 24' 26" E.
? Having ascertained the most westerly of the two creeks crossed
by Captain Sturt on his journey beyond the Macquarie to be the
Bogan, and being desirous to discover the origin of the other, named
Duck Creek, I sent Mr. Larmer last week to survey it. Mr. Larmer
returned yesterday from the Macquarie, having traced Duck Creek
upwards to a large lagoon on the margin of that river, from which
other lagoons and channels also lead into this creek, Mr. Larmer
found in Duck Creek extensive reaches of excellent water ; but the
bed of the Macquarie was dry where he made it. Thus it appears
that, as the dip of the whole country is to the westward, the surplus
waters of the Macquarie are conveyed to the Darling by Duck
Creek, a separate channel altogether to the-westward of the marshes.
? I have much satisfaction in stating that no men could have been
animated with a better spirit than those of this party have been for
?the accomplishment of the object of this expedition. Our long jour-
ney proceeded with equal regularity and security. No cattle were
allowed to stray and retard it, and both these and the camp have been
vigilantly guarded and watched every night. The patient forbear-
ance and good-will of the men towards the aboriginal natives deserve
my highest praise ; and certainly not less their courage when circum-
stances called it forth. This was most conspicuous w'hen exposed
almost singly to the savage natives, as they often were from 'necessity
when watching the cattle on the Darling.
? I have to add that our provisions are scarcely sufficient to supply
the party until it reaches Buree ; also that one man is dangerously
ill, and another unable to walk, from scurvy.
? I trust my humble testimony of the services these men have ren-
dered under perilous circumstances, in expiation of the errors of the
past, and with the best hopes and intentions respecting the future,
will be favourably received by his Excellency the Governor.
? I have the honour to be, Sir,
? Your most obedient Servant,
? T. L. Mitchell,
? Surveyor-General.?


By later accounts from Sydney, dated Dec. 22, 1835, we learn
that a party of police having been sent to ascertain the fate of the
late colonial botanist, Mr. Cunningham, they learned from some
natives that a white man had been murdered on the Bogan, and
succeeded in reaching the tribe of natives encamped on the borders
of a small lake named Budda; three men of which were acknow-
ledged as the murderers, and who were accordingly made pri-
soners. The natives stated, that about six moons since a white
man on the Bogan came up to them and made signs that
hungry?they gave him food and lodging for the night; the white
man repeatedly getting up during the night excited suspicion, and
they determined to destroy him, which determination they carried
into effect the following morning. The officer in command of the
police then desired to be conducted to the spot on which the mur-
der had taken place,?which was at the distance of three days?
journey, at a place called Currindine , where they pointed out some
bones, which they asserted to be those of a white man; and near
to the spot were found apiece of a coat, and also of a Manilla hat.
Being thus convinced of the truth of their statement, and of the
spot where the melancholy event had occurred, the officer, Lieut.
Zouch, had all the remains collected and deposited in the ground,
raised a small mound over them, and barked some of the nearest
trees as the only means in his power to mark the spot. The mur-
derers are in custody for trial.
Thus there can be no longer any doubt that Mr. Cunningham
has. fallen a victim to his zeal in pursuit of his favourite study. He
was a zealous and enterprising botanist, ? k a warm-hearted friend
and a good man, ?and his loss is much regretted in the colony of
New South Wales.
By the last accounts received, on the Ist August, we further
learn that an exploring party, under Major Mitchell, the Surveyor-
General, consisting of twenty-four persons, had again left Sydney,
on the loth March, 1836', for the interior, to finish the tracing of
the Darling, and upon reaching the Murray, into which there is
little doubt the river Darling falls, to return by the Murray to the
located parts of the colony. Sturt, it will be remembered, en-
tered the Murray from the Morrumbidgee, and no part of the for-
mer river above that junction has been traced, unless it should
have happened that Messrs, Hume and Hoveil crossed upon it in
1824. If the instructions with which the Surveyor-General is fur-
nished be successfully executed, a considerable addition will be
made to the geography of the colony in the direction which it is
most useful to explore. 'There is reason to believe that the coun-
try on both banks of the Murray, and generally between the Aus-
tralian Alps and the Morrumbidgee, contains fine pastoral tracts,


well watered by streams issuing from these mountains, whose sum-
mits, in one part, are usually covered with snow. The eastern side
of these mountains is already celebrated as an admirable grazing
country. The downs near Fort Philip have lately become well
known for the excellent pasture they afford to sheep. The course
pursued by Hovell and Hume in 1824 discovered a great extent
of rich land. The general feature and character of the vast extent
of country contained within the course of the Morrumbidgee and
the sea by Lake Alexandria, by Wilson?s Promontory and Cape
Howe, to the 36th parallel of latitude on the east coast of Mew
Holland, may be, in a great measure, finally determined by this
expedition. In like manner, the geographical knowledge of a
large portion of country to the northward of the Morrumbidgee
will have been completed, by tracing the Bogan into the Darling,
and the Darling into the Murray.
IX. ?New Strait at the South-western extremity of New Guinea.
The Java Gazette, of September 1835, mentions the discovery
of a new Strait in the island of New Guinea.?lt appears, that as
far back as the year 1826 the Dutch Colonial Minister sent Lieu-
tenant Kolff, of the Dourga, to examine these coasts ; who re-
ported, that a river, as he supposed, existed about eighty miles
to the eastward of Cape Walsh, the south-western extreme of
Papua, or New Guinea. In 1828 a second expedition was sent,
and the commander of it reported, that the river of Lieutenant
Kolff proved to be a strait.' In April 1835, the schooner Posti-
lion, commanded by Lieutenant Langenberg Kool, was sent to
decide the question; who, on his return, confirmed the latter opi-
nion, and gave the position of the western point of the Strait in
7� 26' South latitude, 138� 44' longitude East of Greenwich ; and
that therefore Cape Walsh is no part of the large island, or
almost continent, of New Guinea. The strait has been named
after the Princess Marianne?the island after the young prince,
vFrederic Henry?and Lieutenants Kolff and Kool have given their
names respectively to the north and south points of the island.
Thus another atom of information is added to the balance against
our utter ignorance of the shores as well as the interior of this
vast island, extending from the Equator to 10� South latitude,
and reaching in a N.W. and S.E. direction not less than 1200
geographical miles, or double the length of the British islands;
of which, since its first discovery in 1527, and its re-discovery by
Dampier in 1700, we have hardly attained any knowledge worth
speaking of.
