The Seals of New South Wales.
HISTORICAL SKETCH.
Origin of Firs! Seal. ?George 111. 1791-1817.
There was presented to His Majesty King George 111, at
the Court of St. James, on the 4th August, 1790, the device
for a Seal of the new settlement of New South Wales.
Attached is a copy of the submission notifying approval of
the design.
? Device for Seal.
Court of St. James?s, 4 August, 1790.
? Whereas there was this day read at the Board a report
from the Right Honourable the Lords of the Committee of
Council appointed for the consideration of all matters relating
to trade and foreign plantations, dated the 3rd of this instant,
humbly offering to His Majesty for his royal approbation
the draft of a Great Seal to be made use of within the Govern-
ment of New South Wales and the islands adjacent in the
Pacific Ocean, viz. :
?On one side : ?Convicts landed at Botany Bay; their
fetters taken off and received by Industry sitting on a bale of
goods, with her attributes, the distaff, beehive, pick-axe, and
spade, pointing to oxen ploughing, the rising habitations, and
a church on a hill at a distance, with a fort for their defence.
Motto ; Sic fortis Etruria crevit; with this inscription round
the circumference ; Sigillum Nov. Camb. Aust.
? On the reverse : ?His Majesty?s arms in a shield, with the
supporters; garter and imperial crown, with the motto; and
round the circumference His Majesty?s titles.


Seal Approved. 1790.
? His Majesty, taking the said draught of a seal into con-
sideration, was pleased, with the advice of his Privy Council,
to approve thereof. And His Majesty doth hereby order that
his Chief Engraver of Seals do forthwith engrave the said
seal, according to the said draught, and lay the same before
His Majesty at this Board for his royal approbation. And
that the Right Honourable Wm. Wyndham Grenville, one
of His Majesty?s Principal Secretaries of State, do cause a
warrant to be prepared for His Majesty?s royal signature to
the said engraver for that purpose.?
Warrant for issue of Seal and Its use. 1791.
On the 2ist January, 1791, there was submitted the following
Warrant for the issue and transmission of the said Seal to the
Governor of New South Wales, empowering that officer to
make use thereof within the scope of his Government.
? Warrant for Seal.
? At the Court of St. James?s, the 21st of January, 1791.
? Present: ??
? The King?s Most Excellent Majesty.
? Lord President. Lord Amliurst.
Duke of Dorset.
Lord Hawkesbury.
Air. Chancellor of the
Duke of Leeds.
Exchequer.
Viscount Falmouth.
? A new seal for His Majesty?s Government of New South
Wales having been this day laid before his Majesty in Council
for his royal approbation, His Majesty was pleased to approve
thereof, and to order, as it is hereby ordered, that the Right
Honourable Lord Grenville, one of His Ma/esty?s Principal


Secretaries of State, do cause a warrant to be prepared for
His Majesty?s royal signature, for transmitting the said seal
to the Governor of New South Wales and empowering him
to make use thereof within the said Government.?
In the Australian Almanac of 1827, published under the
authority of Governor Darling by Robert Howe, Printer to
the Government, amongst the chronicles of notable events
occur the following paragraphs ;
? 1791. Territorial Seal received by Lieutenant Governor
(afterwards Governor) King, who arrived in the
Gorgon; with His Majesty?s Most Gracious Authority
for granting Pardons Absolutely 01 Conditionally,
Sept. 22.?
The only impressions of the first great seal, which have so
far been identified, consist of the obverse attached to early
documents?by a strip of blue serge, in other cases by a
double piece of white tape. So far no impression whatever
of the reverse has been found.
These impressions can only be described as rough ? bumps
of gray sugar paper, apparently damped and soaked in paste
of some kind, squeezed into the obverse of the seal, and
then roughly trimmed round with scissors, so that the ling
of lettering is practically undecipherable or absent, and
only the main and prominent features of the Royal Arms and
escutcheon are preserved.
Probably the following extract, with which I have been
favoured by Dr. Fred. Watson, Commonwealth Historian,
an extract from some records of the Supreme Court, will
explain why we have not so far secured an impression to
complete our series, as apparently no wax was sent out with
the seal.


Extract from Despatch, Governor Phillip to Under-
secretary Nepean, iBth November, 1791.
? The form in which grants of land are made is enclosed,
and which probably may not be so regular as could be wished.
The necessary information on this head will, I hope, be sent
out, and the wax used with the seal on these occasions . No
person is appointed by whom the grants can be registered.?
This letter, dated 18th November, 1791, was acknowledged
by Lord Dundas by despatch dated 14th July, 1792, and
received by Lieut.-Governor Grose, after Governor Phillip
had sailed, on 16th January, 1793.
From the context above, this note may have reference to
the ?Territorial Seal,? but, whether or not, if there were
a shortage of wax for the small Territorial Seal, it would
evidently be a much more difficult matter to provide the
necessary material for the ?Great Seal? we are now referring
to. This possibly explains the reason of the paper ? bumps.?
A perfect copy of this Seal would be a valuable find, and is
necessary to complete the Mitchell collection.
Second Seal. Prince Regent. 1817-1837.
? 1817. New Territorial Seal, accompanied by a warrant from
His Royal Highness the Prince Regent, arrived in
November.?
No known example of this Seal yet discovered.
? 1820. General mourning for his late Majesty ordered, July 20.
His Most Gracious Majesty, King George the Fourth,
proclaimed, with all due solemnity, in Australia,
July 24.?


Obverse.
Third Ssal.?George IV. 1827-1832.
Of the Seal of King George IV (see photograph attached),
a few impressions are available locally. It arrived, and was
in use from 1827 to 1832, and its obverse adhered strictly to
the terms of the Warrant of 1791.

Fourth Seal.?William IV. 1832-18S9.
On the accession of His Majesty King William IV, a new
Seal was forwarded, reaching the State in 1832, remaining
in use up to 1839. Although this Seal was one-sided only?
as per photograph from an impression obtained by the Agent-
General through the Colonial Office, it still retained in the base
of the design the original convict group, with the motto,
Sic fortis Etruria crevit.


Fifth Seal.?Queen Victoria. 1839-1870.
After the accession of Her Majesty Queen Victoria, a new
Seal was in use from the year 1839 until 1870. The impressions
of this Seal of Queen Victoria and the earlier one of King
William IV, obtained through the Colonial Office, have been
forwarded to the Mitchell Library for record purposes, where
they are now exhibited.
This early Seal of Queen Victoria omitted the Etrurian
motto.
Transportation Ceased. 1853.
It should be noted that already the first steps towards
responsibility in Government had been arrived at by admission
of local representatives of the people, nominated by the King?s
representative, to sit in Council, and that later, in 1853,
transportation of criminals was abolished, after a good deal

of local agitation and petition to the Home authorities. A
medal was struck to commemorate this fact, jointly with the
jubilee of the foundation of Tasmania.

Representative Government Granted. 1856.
Within a brief period of this date of 1853, responsible
representative government was granted to the Colony after
a long agitation, headed by Dr. Bland, W. C. Wentworth,
and many others, and in 1856 the opening Session of the First
Legislative Assembly was held under the new Constitution.
Application for new Seal. 1869.
The use of Her Majesty Queen Victoria?s first Seal still
continued, but by papers 1869, No. 16,834, it is shown that
the Colonial Secretary, Mr. Charles Cowper, applied for a
new Great Seal for the Colony, which application was for-
warded in Despatch 135 of the 4th November ?M. 2,404 B,
and in the Gazette, 4th November, 1870, official notice is given
of the new Great Seal being received.
Sixth Seal.?Queen Victoria. 1870-1905.

1905. Suggestion for new Coat of Arms for State.
New Arms granted, 1906.
A despatch, dated 29th November, 1905, was received from
the Colonial Office, intimating that it was desirable that the
State should apply for the grant of a Coat of Arms, and the
Premier, now Sir Joseph Carruthers, directed that various
drawings should be made for the consideration of the Execu-
tive. 1 hese were submitted, and a design was finally approved
for which the Royal Warrant was granted on the nth October,
1906. Copies being duly forwarded to this State, it was
gazetted, and the Arms passed into use.
As to the extent and purpose of the Warrant, as expressed
therein, the question arose some years ago, and the matter
being referred to the Colonial Office the following reply was
received :
? The extent to which the use of these Arms shall
leplace the use of the Royal Arms is a matter within the
discretion of your Ministers.?

Eighth 83a!.? George V. 1912.
Still later, upon the decease of His late Majesty, when a
new Seal was to be prepared for use during the present reign,
a request was made by the Colonial Office that suggested
designs be forwarded by the Government of this State.
Several were prepared, and the one finally transmitted not
meeting entirely with the approval of the Home authorities,
it was remitted back, with a suggestion for an alteration. A
further drawing was made embracing the suggestion, and
transmitted, when the new design was accepted.
The Seal of the State was then prepared and forwarded for
use, being that at present in operation, as from 3rd July, 1912.

SYDNEY.
( Kipling?s *? Song of the English.?)
Greeting ! My birth-stain have I turned to good;
Forcing strong wills perverse to steadfastness:
The first flush of the tropics in my blood,
And at my feet Success!


It will be noted from the description of the first Seal that
the ? obverse ? contained the design of convictism, together
with the motto, Sic fortis Etruria crevit, which occurs in
Book II of Virgil?s ? Georgies,? the text of which is as
follows :
Ex P. Vergili Maronis georgicon , lihro 11, vv. 513-535.
? Agricola incurvo terram dimovit aratro :
hinc anni labor, hinc patriam parvosque nepotes
sustinet, hinc armenta bourn meritosque iuvencos.
Nec requies, quin aut pomis exuberet annus
aut fetu percorum aut Cerealis mergite culmi,
proventuque oneret sulcos atque horrea vincat.
venit hiems : teritur Sicyonia baca trapetis,
glande sues laeti redeunt, dant arbuta silvae;
et varios ponit fetus autumnus, et alte
mitis in apricis coquitur vindemia saxis.
interea dulces pendent circum oscula nati,
casta pudicitiam servat domus, ï¿½bera vaccae
lactea demittunt, pinguesque in gramine laeto
inter se adversis luctantur cornibus haedi.
ipse dies agitat festos fususque per herbam,
ignis ï¿½bi in medio et socii cratera coronant,
te libans, Lenaee, vocat pecorisque magistris
velocis iaculi certamina ponit in ulmo,
corporaque agresti nudant praedura palaestra,
hanc olim veteres vitam coluere Sabini,
hanc Remus et frater, sic fortis Etruria crevit
scilicet et rerum facta est pulcherrima Roma,
septemque una sibi muro circumdedit arces.?
Translation.
? The husbandman with his crooked plough furrows the
soil; from this comes the work for the year; by this he
maintains his country and little grandsons, by this his herds
of oxen, and his bullocks that have served him well. And
there is never a time of rest; for either in fruits the season
richly abounds, or in the offspring of cattle, or in the sheaf


of Ceres? stalk, and loads the furrows with increase, and
overflows the barns. Then winter comes; in the olive mill
is bruised the berry of Sicyon, the swine come home, well
satisfied with mast, the forest gives the fruit of the arbutus,
and autumn drops his various produce, and on the sunny
cliffs the mellowing vintage basks. Meanwhile his dear
children hang about his lips, his stainless house preserves
its purity; his cows hang down their udders fraught with
milk, and fat kids on the smiling lawn with levelled horns
against each other strive. The sire himself keeps holy-day,
and stretched along the grass, where is a kindled altar in the
midst, and his companions wreathe the wine-bowl, with a
libation invokes thee, O Father of the wine-press, and for
the masters of his cattle sets upon an elm the target, for a
match at the flying dart; and their wondrous hardy limbs
they strip for the rustic wrestling bout. This life of yore
the antique Sabines lived, and Remus too, and his brother;
so, I ween , brave Etruria grew, and Rome became the beauty
of the world; and one within herself, incompassed with her
bulwarks seven heights ?
Viewed by the accrued facts of history and later research,
this classic poetical description appears to be poetic license.
The conditions of Government which really existed in the
ancient Etruria, contrast somewhat harshly with the Virgilian
allusion, as the following extract from Denis?s work will
show ;
? Cities and Cemeteries of Etruria.
? Political freedom was a plant which flourished not in
Etruria. The power was wholly in the hands of priestly
nobles; the people had no voice in the government ?not even
the power oj making themselves heard and respected, as at Rome-
Whatever may have been the precise relation between the
ruling class and their dependents, it is clear that it was akin
to the feudal system, and that the mass of the community was
enthralled. The state of society was not precisely that of the


Middle Ages, for there was more union and community of
interest and feeling than among the feudal lords of Germany,
France, or England. The commons must have been a con-
quered people, the descendants of the early inhabitants of
the land, and must have stood in a somewhat similar relation
to their rulers to that which the Perioeci of Laconia held to
their Dorian lords, or the subjugated Saxons of England
bore to their Norman conquerors. That they were serfs
rather than slaves seems evident, from the fact that they
formed the class of which the Etruscan armies were composed.
The Etruscans possessed slaves, like the other nations of
antiquity I ?nay, their bondage was proverbially rigorous 2;
but these were captives taken in war, or in their piratical
expeditions. Niebuhr shows that ? the want of a free and
respectable commonalty ?which the Etruscans, obstinately retain-
ing and extending their old feudal system, never allowed to grow
up?was the occasion of the singular weakness displayed by
the great Etruscan cities in their wars with the Romans, where
the victory was decided by the number and strength of the infantry .? 3
1 Liv., V, i, 22. Dionysius (XI, p. 562) speaks of the Etruscan
nobles leading the ireyeoTai, or serfs, out to battle against the Romans;
and the ? agrestium cohortes ? mentioned by Livy (IX, 36), were
probably of the same class. The rebellious slaves win usurped the
su )reme power at Volsinii are shown by Niebuhr to have been also
serfs, not domestic slaves. Hist. Rom. I, p. 12 j. ; 111, p. 546. See
Vol. 11, p. 22, of this work.
2 This would appear from Martial, IX, 23, 4 ?? Et sonnet innumera
compedc Tuscus ager.? Cicero says the Estruscan pirates used to tie
their living captives to the bodies of the dead (ap. Serv. ad. 7En. VIII,
479); and Virgil relates the same of Mezen tins, the tyrant of Agylla.
Mn. VIII, 485.
8 Niebuhr, I, p. 122, Engl, trans. The great historian, however,
goes too far in asserting that the extant works of the Etruscans could
not have been executed without taskmasters and bondmen (p. 129):
indeed, the distinction between the public works of the Egyptians
and Etruscans, admitted by Niebuhr himself -that all the works of
the latter we are acquainted with have a great public object-is a
sufficient refutation of this position. The works of the Etruscans are
not ostentatious, useless piles, but such as might be produced in
industrious, commercial, yet warlike communities, of no great extent
and under the influence of more popular freedom than was ever enjoyed
in.Etruria. The temples of Paestum, Agrigentum, and Selinus arc
examples of this.


It was also the cause of the inferiority of the Etruscan to the
Greek civilization ?of its comparatively stationary and con-
ventional character ; yet had there been no slaves, and had the
entire population been of one race, the lower classes would hardly
have escaped enthralment, for it is difficult to conceive of a
system of government more calculated to enslave both mind and
body than that of the aristocratical augurs and aruspices of
Etruria.?
The prose extract above quoted is unpleasantly exact,
almost to cynicism, as a reflection of the comparable state
of affairs at the first settlement of Australia. All the
functions of our Government ?civil, military, and religious??
were centred in one governing power, and from this we have
gradually advanced to our present position as a, ? State ? in
a Commonwealth.
A point to be noted in these matters is the carefully
graduated recognition of status indicated on our State Seals.
As the constitutionally ascending steps have been achieved,
so they have been armorially recognised- With the first
penal settlement stage came the bestowal of the old Seal, with
its convict emblems; next, all these were swept away with
the advancing status of the Colony ; and later the State was
asked to make a local choice of Arms, which when claimed
were granted and enrolled ?to be borne for the said State
on seals, shields, banners, flags, or otherwise according to the
Laws of Arms.?


Bringing now into context the suggestion of the Colonial
Office to apply for Arms and the direction contained in the
resulting Royal Warrant as to the purposes for which the
Arms were granted to the State, viz. :
?To be borne for the said State on Seals, Shields,
Banners, Flags, or otherwise, according to the laws of
Arms ?;
and also the general tenor of the reply of the Colonial Office
to the inquiry made through the Agent-General:?
? The extent to which the use of the State Arms shall
replace the use of the Royal Arms is a matter within the
discretion of your Ministers ; ?
taking also into account the application of the Colonial
Secretary, Mr. Cowper, in 1869, and the resultant granting of
a fresh Seal eliminating the original reference of the old penal
stage depiction, and the fact that the historical reference of the
Virgilian motto was abandoned in the Seal of 1839, it would
seem that, when the emblems and motto are continued in use
after this consideration already shown, they discount the
great victory which our earlier patriots?Bland, Wentworth,
and their colleagues ?won in the earlier fifties. Our con-
tinuance of the use of our ? birth-stain,? after the Home
Government has abolished its existence for more than half a
century, is a poor recognition of that independent Australian
spirit which was fashioned and welded by those of our
forebears who threw the energies of the best days of their
lives into the movement for the establishment of the growing
democracy.


The Governor?s Seal.
His Excellency Lord Chelmsford, on relinquishing office,
left a minute for his successor, inviting his attention to the
fact that the continuance of the use of the existing Governor?s
Seal invited allusions to a state of things which no
Governor.any longer desired to refer to. (P. 0., 13/1,618.)
Old Seal. 1791-1914.
This reference having been brought under the notice of the
present Governor, Sir Gerald Strickland, His Excellency
invited the attention of his Ministerial advisers to the matter,
and the Premier and Chief Secretary, Mr. J. S. T. McGowen,
called for a report. After consideration this was forwarded
through His Excellency to the Colonial Office, with the result
that approval was given for a modified form of Seal for use
in the Office of the Governor of New South Wales. This
has now been approved of, and is in actual use from the
commencement of the year 1914.
New Seal. 1914


Thus officially passes from authorised usage the last trace
of the motto ? Sic fortis Etruria crevit ? and its accom-
panying convict emblems. The ? motto ? has been unneces-
sarily used for seventy-five years after its omission from
Queen Victoria?s Seal of 1839, while the convict emblems were
officially omitted from Queen Victoria?s Seal of 1870.
The Chief Secretary, as Minister in charge of the Seals of
the State, having, with the approval of His Excellency
the Governor and the Imperial authorities, so recently
taken the necessary steps to place this matter upon a sound
historical and official footing, it is to be hoped we shall now
finally discontinue any official usage of the obsolete design
and motto.
