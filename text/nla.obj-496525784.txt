FOUR NEW BISHOPRICS IN THE COLONIES.
STATEMENT
WITH RESPECT TO THE NEWLY ERECTED
DIOCESE OF NEWCASTLE, AUSTRALIA.
The Diocese of Newcastle comprises the seven northern counties of New South Wales, Northumberland,
Gloucester, Hunter, Durham, Brisbane, Bligh, and Phillip, together with immense grazing districts beyond the
boundaries of location. It extends north and south from latitude 26° to latitude 33° 30', about 500 miles, and
from east to west through 11 degrees of longitude (141° to 152"), about 700 miles.’ Nearly a third of this vast
area, containing about 120,000 square miles, an area equal to the whole of Great Britain and Ireland, is already
occupied by settlers, whose number is estimated to exceed 40,000.
In this vast Diocese there are at present only seventeen Clergy, and the necessary consequence has been,
that extensive districts are entirely destitute of religious instruction and religious ordinances. A family lately
returned to England from one of these districts, have declared that they did not once see a Clergyman during the
space of seven years.
The statements of the Bishop of Australia with respect to the spiritual destitution of some of these counties,
and of the districts beyond the boundaries of location, deserve the most earnest attention. His Lordship, writes in
a letter dated the 3d of July, 1843 :
“ I may observe that during my present progress I have been in one county, Durham, in the whole extent
of which there is not a Church, and but one Clergyman. In the adjoining county of Brisbane there is one Clergy-
man and one Church —no more. After this I shall pass through three entire counties, in which there is neither
minister nor ordinance of religion; and the five counties included in this enumeration contain a fourth part of the
area of New South Wales.” Surely it is truly observed in the Report of the Society for the Propagation of the
Gospel in Foreign Parts for 1844, p. 92: —“ Nothing can be more appalling than the foregoing statement, of five
entire counties, forming a fourth part of the area of New South Wales, having but two Churches and two Clergy-
men.” Of these five counties are in the Diocese of Newcastle.
The vast districts beyond the boundaries of location are in even a more fearful state of spiritual destitution.
Of these the Bishop of Australia writes, in a letter dated 22d June, 1844 :
- “My chief anxiety, however, at this time, is concerning the districts beyond the boundaries, over which
population is extending rapidly, without attendant provision even for their maintenance in the belief of Christianity.
Upon the fearful deficiency under which these extensive tracts are suffering, and apparently condemned to suffer,
I have already addressed you.”
Elsewhere his Lordship writes: —“It is impossible to estimate too highly the services which our Clergy
are here placed in a condition to confer, inasmuch as they may in reality be said, as far as their restricted efforts
can accomplish it, to be resisting the establishment of the dominion of Atheism, It may appear a strong term to
employ, but I use it deliberately, upon conviction, from experience,”
Even in the more favoured districts, which are placed under the care of their appointed pastor, it may be
interesting to observe the laborious but imperfect nature of the duties performed. The Rev. E. Smith, in a report
to the Bishop of Australia, says, “ I have arranged to visit each station in my district once in three weeks.
“ Ist Sunday. Service at Palmerville, and service at Mr. Hall’s, a distance of three miles.
“2d Sunday. At Mr. Weston’s or Mr. Wright’s alternately, the men belonging to the two establishments
uniting; I then ride ten miles, and have a service at Mount Campbell. Mr. Wright’s is twenty-two miles from
this, and Mount Campbell ten miles from Mr. Wright’s, so that my services on the second Sunday, when Igo to
Mr. Wright’s, take me a ride of about fifty-two miles.
“3d Sunday. I ride seven miles, and have service at Mr. Moore’s; this unites three establishments.
I then ride eight miles, and have service at the Queenbayan Inn. I then ride six miles, and have service at
Pinlego, Mr. R. Campbell’s. Thus on the third Sunday I have three services, and ride about twenty miles.”
Such are the truly missionary labours of a Chaplain in the vast district which constitutes the Diocese of
Newcastle.
No mention has been made of any project to convert the native Australian 'population, because such large
tracts occupied by English settlers are still entirely destitute of religious ordinances. It is, however, earnestly
desired and confidently expected, that at least one unattached Missionary will be ere long employed among these
unfortunate heathen, fresh tribes of whom have recently been discovered in the northern parts of the Diocese.
From these statements, the vast extent and spiritual destitution of this newly-erected see may be distinctly
gathered. And to meet these difficulties and supply these wants, it is the earnest desire of the Bishop-designate of
Newcastle to take out with him a limited number of Clergy and Candidates for Orders. Four Clergy are at the
lowest computation immediately required :
One at the station of Paterson, which is vacant ;
One in the destitute counties of Phillip and Bligh; and
Two in the vast districts of New England and the Liverpool Plains.
It is proposed to take out also four Candidates for Orders, They will be prepared for Ordination, either at
the College lately opened at S\’dney, or in the house, and under the superintendence of the Bishop of Newcastle :


and when ordained, will be stationed in some of the many districts which the Bishop of Australia has described as
so fearfully destitute of all religious privileges.
The offers of devoted aid, from both Clergy and Candidates for Orders, have been sufficiently numerous to
justify the expectation, that their numbers need be limited solely by a prudential regard to the amount of funds
available for their immediate outfit, and their future maintenance ; remembering always—for it ought ever to be
remembered—that the principle on which this Appeal is made, and on which the Society for the Propagation of
the Gospel in Foreign Parts desires to act, is to contribute in some given proportion to the funds raised in each
particular district, and to limit the contribution to a certain period of time, as in this case to the period of
five years.
What funds, then, are required, that the Bishop of Newcastle may carry out with him to his Diocese four
Clergymen and four Candidates for Ordination 1 On the most moderate computation, the outfit and passage for
four Clergymen, (taking the married and unmarried together,) cannot require a less sum than £BOO. And similar
expenses for four Candidates for Orders (even with the aid expected from their friends) cannot require a less sum
than £4OO, making an immediate outlay of £1,200.
Again, the incomes of the four Clergymen cannot be estimated at less than £6OO per annum ; while a sum
of £IOO per annum may suffice for the personal expenses of the four Candidates for Orders—some proportion of
such expenses being supplied from their own resources, and the Bishop cheerfully undertaking to provide them
with board and lodging in his own house.
The funds, then, which are required on the most moderate computation, are the present sum of twelve
hundred pounds, and subscriptions for five years to the amount of seven hundred pounds per annum.
This Statement is put forth, and this Appeal is made in behalf of the newly-erected Diocese of Newcastle,
Australia, in firm reliance, that, by the Divine blessing, sufficient funds will be provided for the outfit and moderate
maintenance of devoted, self-denying men, who are willing to leave country and friends and family for a distant
land, where they desire to labour for the glory of their God and the salvation of their fellow-creatures.
