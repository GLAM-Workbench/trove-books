The Balsams and Vegetable Oils, of which the famous Dutch Drops Capsules are com-
posed, have (for hundreds of years) been used by the medical profession for the relief and
cure of all diseases having their origin in the Kidneys and Bladder. They are the most rational
remedies that can be used for any of these complaints, because of their soothing and healing
effect on the whole Urinary tract. They also ac. as an antiseptic and prophylactic in their
passage through the stomach and bowels, and thereby purify the whole system. The patient
will note their quick absorption by the system in that their odor can be detected m the urine
a few hours after taking the first dose.
Dutch Drops Capsules will quickly and thoroughly relieve all inflammatory conditions of
the Urethral tract, and a course of treatment will so strengthen the tissues that a recurrence
of the trouble will be retarded.
The Soothing Oils and Balsams composing Dutch Drops Capsules quickly relieve all
painful affections of the Urethral tract.
These Capsules do not act on the Bowels, and to get the best results from this treatment
for any complaint, the bowels should move freely at least once a day. Many pills and medicines
sold to the public for this purpose are too irritating, and we would advise you, if you have
need of a medicine for this purpose to use only the Dutch Drops Purifying Stomach and Liver
Pills. They are purely vegetable, and act upon the bowels and liver, removing the waste
matter, which, if allowed to remain, poisons the system.
Remember the three preparations that, working together, will restore you to health and
strength, are:?
Dutch Drops Capsules, Dutch Drops Liniment, and Dutch Drops Stomach and Liver Pills.
