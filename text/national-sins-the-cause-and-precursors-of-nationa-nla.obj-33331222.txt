The publication of this Discourse has been unexpect-
edly delayed, for nearly a month beyond the time at
which it would otherwise have appeared, by the preva-
lence of the epidemic which is still so general through-
out the colony; both the author and the printers
having been affected with it. In answer to the prayers
of the colony, on the 2nd of November last, God was
graciously pleased to send us rain from heaven on the
4th ultimo; but the rapid transition from the ex-
tremely arid state of the atmosphere, which had been
induced by the late drought, to an atmosphere more
than usually charged with humidity, naturally induced
a wide-spreading influenza or catarrh; and the epi-
demic has already proved fatal to many of the colo-
nists, especially the aged and the very young. In this
way, God, who had so recently put forth his hand to
touch our substance or property by sending ?a drought
upon the land, the corn, and the cattle,? and who has
doubtless seen that we neither humbled ourselves under
his afflictive dispensation, nor were sincerely grateful to
him for his subsequent visitation of mercy, has been
pleased to pour into that cup of mercy a few drops
from the vial of his indignation and wrath, by putting


forth his hand a second time to touch our persons!
Surely when God?s judgments are thus abroad upon
the land, the inhabitants thereof should learn
righteousness!
It may perhaps seem strange to the reader, that in
enumerating some of the more enormous of the sins of
the colony, that of intemperance should have been
omitted. But the intemperance of this colony is not
so much a sin of colonial as of British origin ; it is the
sin of our original constitution as a penal colony and
not a sin of colonial growth; and it cannot, therefore,
be regarded, however enormous in itself, as one of those
sins of the land for which we have reason to expect the
visitations of divine judgment, in contradistinction to
those that call down similar visitations in the mother-
country.

A DISCOURSE,
Bsc. <�* c.
? The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah con-
cerning the dearth. Judah mourneth, and the gates
thereof languish; they are black unto the ground; and
the cry of Jerusalem is gone up. And their nobles
have sent their little ones to the waters; they returned
with their vessels empty; they were ashamed, and con-
founded, and covered their heads. Because the ground
is chapt, for there was no rain in the earth; the plow-
men were ashamed, they covered their heads. Yea, the
hind also calved in the field, and forsook it, because
there was no grass. And the wild asses did stand in
the high places; they snuffed up the wind like dragons;
their eyes did fail, because there was no grass. O
Lord, though our iniquities testify against us, do thou
it for thy names sake; for our backslidings are many;
we have shined against thee.? ? Jeremiah, xiv. I?7.1 ?7.
It is a truth of divine revelation, confirmed by the
experience of all ages, and attested even by the wisdom
of the heathen, that the world is governed by an infi-
nitely wise, and powerful, and holy, and beneficent
God. In the language of scripture, ?He is the Gover-
nor among the nations:?*and ?he doeth according to his
will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants
* Psalm xxii. 28�
...� *


of the earth; and none can stay his hand, or say unto
him, what doest thou??*
The fact that the world is governed by an infinitely
wise, and powerful, and holy, and beneficent God, has
been a ground of joy and rejoicing to all good men in
all past ages. ? The Lord reigneth,? saith the Psalmist;
? let the earth rejoice, and the multitude of isles be
glad thereof. ?f Oh, my brethren, if the world were
governed even by the wisest and best of mortals, hoy
miserably would it be governed for myriads and myriads
more of its inhabitants! How much iniquity would
then pass unseen and unpunished ! How much injustice,
and oppression, and cruelty, would be perpetrated with
impunity ! Virtue might be struggling with adverse
circumstances in ten thousand instances, and in ten
thousand places simultaneously, but there would be no
eye to behold it, no pen to record it! And the prayer of
the destitute, which the Lord God Almighty delights to
hear and to answer graciously from the place of his
holy habitation, would never reach the ear of his vice-
gerent upon earth!
But while ? the paths of the Lord are all mercy and
truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimo-
nies,?! that is to all his sincere worshippers, they are full
of indignation and wrath to all the workers of iniquity.
And therefore the Psalmist, who calls the earth to
rejoice, and the multitude of isles to be glad, because
the Lord reigneth, in the ninety-seventh Psalm, assigns
that very fact as a ground for trembling and quaking
tor fear in his address to the nations in the ninety-ninth.
?The Lord reigneth; let the people tremble ; he sitteth
between the cherubims; let the earth be moved.? And
in allusion to those divine judgments which the iniqui-
ties of men call down upon the nations, he adds in the
third verse of that psalm, ?Let them praise thy great
and terrible name; for it is holy.?
Yes, brethren, the same God who, in the overflowings
of his goodness and mercy, sends us ? rain from heaven

and fruitful seasons,?* is sometimes pleased also in his
righteous indignation to seal up his clouds, so to speak,
and to make ? the heavens as brass above us and the
earth as iron beneath ;?f causing the beauteous sun?
that glorious image and emanation of Deity in the natu-
ral world?whose light and heat are so benignantlv
designed to dispense life and joy to creation, to perform
his daily circuit of the heavens for months together,
like a fiery meteor in the firmament; glowing as a fur-
nace and blazing more and more fiercely from day to
day, and burning up and destroying the precious fruits
of the earth ; until, as in the affecting instance of our
text, ? the ground is chapped, because there has been
no rain in the land; the nobles send their little ones to
the waters, and they find none and return with their
vessels empty; the plowmen are ashamed and cover
their heads; and the sheep and cattle forsake their
young in the field, because there is no grass!? Now
as God, in his infinite wisdom, and doubtless in his great
mercy, has been pleased for the second time within
these few years, to afflict this land of our adoption with
a visitation of his divine providence, precisely similar in
its general aspect and effects to the one so affectingly
described in our text, although perhaps not so severe, it
becomes us, its inhabitants, ? to hear the rod and him
who hath appointed it;| that is, to ascertain, if possible,
the cause and objects of so afflictive a dispensation, so
as to order our future walk and conversation accord-
ingly. For ? when God?s judgments are in the earth,
tii6 inhabitants of the world should learn
ness.?� &

s
With this view, I observe that as nations and com-
munities, which exist only in this present state of
being, cannot possibly be the subjects of divine govern-
ment in another and future world, it follows that,
under the righteous administration of an infinitely
wise and holy God, they must be dealt with according

to their deserts during their national or Social ex-
istence in this present world; receiving good or evil
at the hand of God in their national or social capacity
as they deserve either the one or the other. For,
although the ancient Jews, in whose whole history as
a nation, the dealings of divine providence were so
remarkably accordant with this principle, were, in their
national capacity, God?s peculiar people, and were
placed under a very peculiar dispensation, I think it
quite evident, from the whole tenour of the Old Tes-
tament Scriptures, that the principles of the Divine
Government that were acted on in regard to that
ancient people were also designed to be acted on in
regard to every other nation or community enjoying
similar privileges and placed in similar circumstances,
in comparison with other nations or communities,
to the end of the world. For as the temporal and
political prosperity of the ancient Jewish people was
always conjoined with their national maintenance of
the worship of the one living and true God, and with
their general practice of that pure morality in which he
delights, while their national apostacy from that worship
was uniformly visited with general judgments and
national calamities, we find from the experience of all
ages that it is ?righteousness that exalteth a nation,
and that sin is? not only, ? a reproach,? but a source
of general calamity, and wide-spreadingdisaster, and fina.
ruin ?to any people.?* It is still true of every Chris-
tian nation, as it was of the ancient Jews, in the beau-
tiful language of the prophet, ? When Ephraim spake
trembling, he exalted himself in Israel; but when he
offended in Baal he died :?f that is, so long as the Jewish
people maintained the pure worship of Jehovah and the
practice of that holiness which his law enjoins, they
enjoyed general prosperity as a nation, and occupied an
exalted position among the nations of the earth. But
no sooner did they apostatize from that worship and fall
into the abominable practices of the surrounding
Proverbs, xiv. 34.
t Hosea, xiii. 1,


heathen, than u the sun?? of their national prosperity,
went down while it was yet day;?* their civil govern-
ment being utterly subverted, and the whole nation
scattered at length to the four winds of heaven.
Following up this idea, therefore, let us endeavour to
ascertain what particular sins it was on the part of the
ancient Jewish people, as a nation, that more especially
provoked the Holy One of Israel to anger against them,
and called down upon them general judgments and
national calamities.
I* I observe, then, in the first place, that the public
or national sin which more especially provoked the
divine anger, and called down divine judgments on
the ancient Jewish people, was the sin of blood-
guiltiness. You will find a most remarkable proof of this
m the 21st chap, of the 2nd Book of Samuel, and Ist
verse, where it is recorded that ? there was a famine in
the days of David three years, year after year; and
iJayid, rightly conceiving that there must be some
national sin unrepented of and unforgiven, that God
meant to punish in that national judgment, ? enquired
of the Lord. And the Lord answered, It is for Saul, and
tor his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites
But who and what were those Gibeonites, you will pro-
bably ask, on whose account the whole nation of Israel
was thus visited with so grievous a famine, during the
reign of David, that man after God?s own heart ? Why
we are told in the 2nd verse of the same chapter : ? The
Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of
the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of
Israel had sworn unto them, and Saul sought to slay
them in his zeal to the children of Israel and Judah/?
In short, the Gibeonites were a miserable tribe of the
ancient Aboriginal inhabitants of the land of Israel
whom you are well aware, the Almighty had himself
devoted to utter extermination because of their flagrant
. leir a jommable and their heaven-defying iniquities!
But the faith of the nation had been solemnly pledged
* Jeremiah, xv. 9.
. -a.
AT* -


to these Gibconites Uy Josl.ua and tl.ft princes o< Israel;
and although that pledge had been obta.nel sur ep-
titiously, and on false pretences, by the Gibeomtes,
and was itself directly contrary to the divine comma'd,
the Lord, who is a God of truth would not sufferit to
be violated thereafter in the smallest particular. A ,
therefore, when, after the lapse o three centur.es and
upwards, Saul, as king of Israel sought to.sky he
Gibeonitcs in his pretended zeal for God and (o. the
nation, the Lord brought a tamme of three years
duration upon the land for this national crime, during
the reign of his successor David! . , .
Now, my brethren, let us ask ourselves serious.y and
in earnest, and standing, as we are, in the immediate
presence of God on this day of fasting and humiliation
on account of our social and public, as well as of our
private and individual, sins; let us ask ourselves seriously
and in earnest, whether, as the European colonists o
this territory, we can lay our hands upon om he* - ,
and plead not guilty concerning the Gibeomtes, I mean
the wretched Aboriginal inhabitants of this land . Alas,
we are verily guilty concerning these our brethren ; 01
not only have we despoiled them of then land, a d
piven them in exchange European vice and European
disease in every foul and fatal form, but the blood o
hundreds, nay of thousands of their number, who have
fallen from time to time in their native forests, when
waging unequal warfare with their civilized aggres-
sors, still stains the hands of many ot the inhabitants
of the land ! And think you, my brethren, that it
God visited the slaughter of the Gibeomtes, which had
been perpetrated by the bloody bouse of Saul alone,
on the whole nation of Israel, with three successive years
of famine, the blood of these innocents will call to
heaven for vengeance in vain against this whole Emo-
pean community? Assuredly not; if it is the same
Almighty God who still sitteth in the heavens, and
reigns supremely among the inhabitants of the earth !
The Gibeonitcs were the miserable remnant ot an ac-
cursed race, doomed by the Almighty himself to utter

extermination ; and yet, when the hands even of a
powerful monarch were ruthlessly embrued in the blood
of certain of their number, Jehovah himself became
their mighty avenger, and required that innocent blood
of the whole house of Israel ! Much more then will
the Lord avenge the blood of the wretched Aborigines
of this territory, who have fallen unnecessarily before
the progress of European colonization, on the European
inhabitants of this land ! For no withering and blasting
curse stands recorded against them in the book of
God, to place them beyond the reach of His tender
mercies. They are still bone of our bone and flesh of
our flesh ?formed originally after the image of God,
like ourselves, and guilty only, as far as we are
concerned, of an Ethiopian skin, and an untutored
soul. We may rest assured, therefore, that these
Gibeonites, so to speak, are especially under the divine
protection ; that the cry of their wrongs has already
entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth; and that
? when he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth
them.?*
Yes, brethren, every district of this land of our
adoption has been defiled with the blood of these inno-
cents ; and who knows but it is for this that the Lord
has been pleased, a second time, ? to call for a drought
upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the
corn, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil, and
upon that which the ground bringeth forth, and upon
men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labour of the
hands ??f If so, we have reason this day to humble
ourselves mightily before the Lord our maker, as the
sinful members of a sinful community; taking with us
these words of the prophet, ? O Lord, though our ini-
quities testify against us, do thou it for thy name?s
sake ; for our backslidings are many ; we have sinned
against thee.?
11. The second of the public or national sins for which
divine judgments were more especially inflicted upon
* Psalm ix. 12,
t Haggai, i. 11.
j
I
? -?***


the ancient Jewish people in their public or national
capacity, was injustice and , on the part of
the rich and powerful, towards the poorer classes of
the community. A spirit of grasping covetousness
appears to have got possession of the great body of
the Jewish people, and especially of the wealthier and
influential classes, in the period of the decline and fall
of the ancient kingdoms of Israel and Judah ; and to
gratify this all-absorbing and relentless spirit, justice
and humanity, and every nobler feeling of the soul,
were openly sacrificed at the shrine of Mammon.
The poor were thus harassed and oppressed and en-
slaved by their richer neighbours ; they were valued as
mere articles of property, and treated as mere beasts of
burden, till the anger of the Lord was kindled against
Israel and Judah, insomuch that he emptied the whole
nation out of the good land which he had given to
their fathers, agreeably to his own threatening by his
servants the prophets, ? I will wipe Jerusalem, as a
man wipeth a dish, wiping it, and turning it upside
down.?* ? Thus saith the Lord? by his prophet Amos,
(ii. 6.) ? For three transgressions of Israel, and for
four, 1 will not turn away the punishment thereof;
because they sold the righteous for silver,? that is, for
a silver coin of about the value of half a crown of our
money, ? and the poor for a pair of shoes,? or sandals;
? and they lay themselves down upon clothes laid to
pledge by every altar.? And again, in the fourth chapter
and Ist verse, ? Hear this word, ye kine of Bashan,
that are in the mountain of Samaria, which oppress the
poor, which crush the needy, which say to their mas-
ters, Bring, and let us drink. The Lord God hath
sworn by his holiness, that, 10, the days shall come
upon you, that he will take you away with hooks, and
your posterity with fish-hooks.? Observe also, my
brethren, that the divine judgment inflicted upon
ancient Israel for their injustice and oppression towards
the poor of the land, was just the very one under
* 2 Kings, xxi. 13,


which this colony is at present suffering at the hand
of God?peradventure for the same iniquities?drought
and famine. ? And I also,? says the Lord by his pro-
phet Amos, (chap. iv. 6th verse.) ? And I also have
given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and
want of bread in all your places : yet have ye not re-
turned unto me, saith the Lord.?
Yes, brethren, I fear ? the Lord hath a controversy
with? this colony also for a similar reason, and that we
are now feeling the bitter effects of his indignation and
wrath, in precisely the same manner in which they were
exhibited of old towards ancient Israel. Upwards of
twenty-five thousand, or one fourth of the whole inha-
bitants of the land are, you are well aware, in a state
of ignominious bondage to the rest ?because of their
own iniquities; the original constitution of this colony
having, under divine providence, provided this expe-
dient alike for the benefit of their masters and for
their own general reformation. But you are all well
aware, my brethren, that in utter forgetfulness of
the great ends for which this beneficent arrangement
was originally appointed, or rather in utter reckless-
ness of the moral and spiritual welfare of their fellow
mortals, the spirit in which these degraded men are
almost universally regarded by their masters, and the
treatment they almost uniformly receive, are precisely
similar to the spirit and treatment experienced by the
poorer classes in ancient Israel, on the part of the weal-
thier and influential classes, in the times of the prophet
Amos. For although there are comparatively few acts
of downright cruelty or oppression perpetrated amongst
us, (for which, perhaps, under divine providence, we
may thank the spirit of the British constitution and the
laws of our country,) it is nevertheless notorious that
these persons are almost universally regarded as mere
articles of property or beasts of burden, without the-
least reference to their character and standing as im-
mortal creatures in the presence of their God ?without
the least reference to any other consideration than the
profit of (heir masters. That spirit of grasping covet-
if
f

ousness that pervades the land, and before which justice
and humanity and religion, and every nobler feeling
of the soul, are all recklessly sacrificed at the shrine of
Mammon, has thus virtually degraded man, in the
estimation of his fellow worm, to a level with the beasts
that perish; and the grand and noble object of the
peculiar constitution of this colony has thus been lost
sight of for a mere matter of gain. Now it is impossible
but that the Divine Being, who originally created man
after his own image, and who will not suffer the faint
traces of that image that are still visible in our fallen
humanity to be set at nought and dishonoured even in
the person of a convicted felon, must feel extreme dis-
pleasure at a state of things so utterly repugnant to his
own character as a God of mercy, so utterly at variance
with the manifestations of that character as exhibited so
gloriously in the remedial dispensation of the Gospel.
And for this peculiar sin of the land, doubtless, he is
now visiting us with drought and threatening us with
famine. ? Hear the word of the Lord, ye children of
Israel; for the Lord hath a controversy with the inha-
bitants of the land, because there is , nor
knowledge of God in the land.?*
111. The third of the public or national sins for which
divine judgments were especially inflicted upon the an-
cient Jewish people, in their public or national capacity,
was Sabbath-profanation. It is remarkable with what
jealousy, to speak with becoming reverence, the divine
lawgiver of ancient Israel vratched over the observance
of this fourth commandment of the decalogue, ? Remem-
ber the Sabbath day to keep it holy.? There is no other
commandment of God?s law, to the keeping of which
there are such promises held forth in Scripture, or
against the breakers of which there are such threaten-
ings denounced: and the circumstance is doubtless
intended to teach us, that a man?s observance of the
Sabbath is the surest indication of the character and
worth of his religious profession, the best touchstone

of his sincerity. ? Thus saith tire Lord, Blessed is the
man that keepelh the Sabbatli from polluting it.?*
? Thus saith the Lord unto the eunuchs that keep my
Sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and
take hold of my covenant; even unto them will I give
in mine house and within my walls a place and a name
better than of sons and of daughters: I will give them
an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.?f ?If
thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing
thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a
delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable; and shalt
honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding
thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words :
Then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord ; and I will
cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth,
and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father:
for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.?J Again,
the prophet Ezekiel (chap. xx. 23,) represents the God
of Israel as lifting up his hand to heaven, and swearing
to Israel in the wilderness, that he would scatter
them among the heathen, and disperse them among
the nations, if they should despise his statutes and
pollute his sabbaths. The awful threatening is con-
tained in Levit. xxvi. 33 ?35, ? And I will scatter
you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword
after you; and your land shall be desolate and your
cities waste. Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths,
as long as it lieth desolate, and ye be in your enemies?
land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy her
sabbaths. As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest;
because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt
upon it.? Accordingly we find in the concluding
chapter of the 2nd book of Chronicles, that after the
sacred historian has recorded the destruction of Jerusa-
lem, and the carrying away of the last miserable remnant
of the people to Babylon, he informs us, in the 21st
verse, that all this was done ? To fulfil the word of the
Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had en-
* Isaiah, Ivi. 2.
t lb. Ivi, 4?5.
t lb. Iviii. 13, 14,


joyed her sabbaths ; for as long as she lay desolate she
kept sabbath, to fulfil threescore and ten years/' In
like manner in the 13th chapter of the book of Nehemiah
at the 15th verse, it is thus written, ? In those days
saw I in Judah some treading wine-presses on the
sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses ; as
also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens,
which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath-day :
and I testified against them in the day wherein they
sold victuals. There dwelt men of Tyre also therein,
which brought fish, and all manner of ware, and sold
on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in
Jerusalem. Then 1 contended with the nobles of
Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this that
ye do, and profane the sabbath-day ? Did not your
fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil
upon us, and upon this city ? yet ye bring more wrath
upon Israel, by profaning the sabbath.
Alas I brethren, there is reason to fear that there is
great wrath against the inhabitants of this land for their
sabbath-profanation. Many, it is well known, both in
the towns and in the country, unblushingly pursue
their ordinary occupations on God?s holy day, vylnle a
much greater number systematically spend it in the
utter neglect of God?s word and worship, in sinful
pleasure and abominable dissipation. Many masters,
even, of whom better things might have been expected
from their own Christian education, encourage their
bond-servants to profane the sabbath, and set them
the example in their own evil practice ; while in many
parts of the interior men set their mouths boldly against
the heavens, and impiously tell us that in such remote
localities as theirs there is no sabbath at all!
And will not the Lord be avenged on such a com-
munity as this? Will he overlook in us, professing
Christians, enjoying as we are such high and precious
privileges, what he punished in ancient Israel with
seventy years captivity ? Assuredly not! The with-
holding of the early and the latter rain in their appointed
seasons, the withering and blasting of the precious


fruits of the earth by a long continued and oppressive
drought, and the threatening of famine from the ap-
prehended failure of the harvest?these are but the
first droppings of his wrath, which, if we repent not,
and turn unto the Lord with all our hearts in this the
day of our merciful visitation, will ere long, we have
reason to fear, burst in storms and fire, in pestilence
and desolation, upon the land.
Such, my Christian friends and brethren, are some of
those public or national sins, with which, as a European
community inhabiting this Colonial Territory, we are
doubtless deeply chargeable in the presence of a sin-
hating and sin-avenging God. And when we look
around us at this moment in all parts of the Colony,
and contemplate the lamentable and disastrous effects
of the present calamitous drought, and the dismal pros-
pect which it holds out to us for the future, how can we
doubt that it is for such sins that there is wrath at pre-
sent against this land and people? We have each,
doubtless, his own private or individual sins to repent
of and to be forgiven, ere we can enter into life. We
have each some peculiar, some cherished sin? the sin
that more easily besets him, ?to confess unto God and
to put away, ere we can cherish the hope of salvation ;
for, though dear as a right hand or a right eye, there is
no possibility of our entering on other terms into the
kingdom of heaven. We may also, it may be, have
contracted much guilt in the presence of an all-seeing
and heart-searching God, as members of Christian
Churches ; inasmuch as we may hitherto have made a
public profession of religion without cherishing a heart-
felt affection towards the divine Redeemer, and named
the name of Christ as our chosen Saviour, without
departing from iniquity?thereby rendering ourselves
amenable to that fearful malediction, ? Whosoever
loveth not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema
Maran-atha that is accursed in the day of the Lord.
But as it is for their public or social sins that God visits
cm

whole communities with general judgments and national
calamities, it is for these sins-our sms as a European
community inhabiting this Colonial Territory that we
are more especially called on to humble ourselves before
our Almighty Maker on this day of public lasting and
humiliation, and to ? call upon our God, individually
and collectively, ? if so be that God may think upon
us that we perish not.?* ? .
Some of you will doubtless tell me, in reference to
the preceding enumeration of our public or national
sins, that having had little or no intercourse with the
Aborigines yourselves, you cannot possibly have con-
tracted guilt in the manner alleged ; that being tor tic
most part inhabitants of towns, you have not even the
opportunity of practising injustice and oppression
towards that class of our colonial population that is
doomed for their own past iniquities to ignominious
bondage; and that your regular attendance on the ordi-
nances of religion affords at least a presumption that
you are not given to that enormous Sabbath profana-
tion that characterizes and disgraces so many of the
inhabitants of the land. . . , , .
Recollect, however, that when God visited the whole
nation of Israel with a famine of three years? duration
for the slaughter of the Gibeonites, it was the bloody
house of Saul alone that was really guilty ; the sin of
that bloody house being regarded as a national sin, and
punished accordingly by Almighty God, ? the Governor
among the nations,? with a national judgment, in the
visitations of which all were involved alike, the righteous
and the wicked, the innocent and the guilty. For
when God visits a nation for its national sms, the sword
of his justice falls indiscriminately on all the families of
the nation.
Besides, the public or national sins I have enumerated
are doubtless in great measure the result of the low
standard of public opinion that has been created by
general consent in this colony, in reference to the rights
ID

of the Aborigines, the claims of the prison population,
and the observance of the Sabbath; and for the crea-
tion of this low standard of public opinion every indi-
vidual member of this community is personally respon-
sible. For, however humble the position we may occupy
in society, and however limited the sphere of our personal
influence, we are each able to exert a certain degree of
influence, either for good or for evil, in our respective
circles, and to produce a corresponding effect on the
general morality and religion of the land. The very
expression of abhorrence at those deeds of murderous
atrocity that are still perpetrated amongst us from time
to time, on the helpless Aborigines of this territory ; the
very exhibition of virtuous indignation at the manner
in which the prison population of this colony are de-
graded, in the general practice, if not in the general
estimation, of their masters, to the level of mere beasts
of burden ?without souls to be cared for, or a future
immortality of blessedness to win, through faith in
Christ Jesus, evinced in genuine and sincere repentance;

?and the silent testimony of our own Christian prac-
tice in remembering the Sabbath day to keep it holy,
whatever others may be doing around us : these will all
have their unseen but powerful influence in elevating
the standard of public morals in the matters in ques-
tion, and in purging away the iniquities of the land.
Let this influence, therefore, be exerted by each one of
you, my Christian friends and brethren, in your respec-
tive circles for the future, that ? the fierce anger of the
Lord may be turned away from us,? or rather, lest the
Lord should, in his righteous indignation, be provoked
to visit us with still greater calamities, and to ? smite the
land with a curse.?*
