1 Benn Lomond, Yan Dieman’s Land, at Sunset, taken in descending ike Mountain,
2 The Bason, at the Cataract, two miles from Launceston, Yan Dieman’s Land.
3 View of Mill’s Plains, Van Dieman’s Land. Painted on the spot.
4 Portrait of Mr. Hulks.
5 Launceston, and the River Tamur. There is a remarkable peculiarity in the Trees
in this Country; however numerous, they rarely prevent your tracing, through
them, the whole distant Country.
6 Benn Lomond, from Bonney’s Farm, in Buffaloe Plains, Yan Dieman’s T.anrl
.7 Mount Wellington, and the River Derwent. Taken from near Brighton, at a dis-
tance of nearly 15 miles. The Natives are portraits.
8 A View in Mill’s Plains, Yan Dieman’s Land. This gives a good idea of the thickly-
wooded part of the Country: it is possible, almost every- where, to drive a car-
riage as easily as in a park in England.
9 The Small Owl of Van Dieman’s Land, size of Life.
10 The top of Benn Lomond, Yan Dieman’s Land. The Rocks called the Stacks, are
of great height, and evidently split asunder by great violence. The small i s
supposed to have been a Volcano; three of its sides remain perfect, the rest
broken down by the water.
11 Mount Wellington, at Sun-rise, the Moon going down. This View is taken close to
Hobart Town, Van Dieman’s Land.
12 The Young Cuckoo of Van Dieman’s Land with its Nurse. They are evidently
brought up by other birds, as in England.


13 * A View of the Artist’s House and Garden, in Mill’s Plains, Van Dieman’s Land.
14 Benn Lomond, from Batman’s Look Out. So named on account of Mr. Batman

Gum Trees; the round and full, the Shea Oak; the small, the Whattle.
20 Benn Lomond, and the South Esk, Van Dieman’s Land.
21 Hobart Town, taken from the Artist’s Garden. The Geraniums, Roses, &c., will
give some idea to what perfection gardens may be brought in this country. To
the left of the Church is the Government House; the Barracks are on the
eminence to the right.
22 A View, with Natives, near the Cataract, one mile from Launceston, Van Dieman’s
Land.
23 Pern Trees, on the side of Mount Wellington, Van Dieman’s Land, with Natives in
the Shade.
24 A View of the Derwent, near Sorrell Town, Van Dieman’s Land.

Land.

Mr, Wedge’s Farm, Van Dieman’s Land.

lesser, Whattle.

32 The Cataract, near Launceston, Van Pieman’s Land. Moonlight. The Fire lighted
by Captain Langdon, as a Beacon to some lost Friends, who are on the top of the
Rock.
33 The Cataract, Two Miles from Launceston, taken from the Water. Here are some
of the boldest and grandest Scenes in the Country. It was formerly a spot much
frequented by the Natives for the purpose of Fishing, but they are now nearly
extirpated.

36 * Rome, St. Peter’s, & The Castle of St, Angelo; and the Sabine Hills and Mountains
about Tivoli.

These Pictures have been long in the possession of Mr. Glover, by whom they are sup-
posed to he two of the finest Specimens of this great Artist’s works.


With the exception of the Portrait of the Artist, and the six last numbers, the
whole of the Pictures enumerated in the foregoing Catalogue have been painted by Mr.
Glover in Van Pieman’s Land. Prom the well-known character of the Artist’s works
for their fidelity and truth, it is presumed the Pictures will become generally interesting,
and it will perhaps be gratifying to his Countrymen to see, from the number of Pictures
he has painted in so short a time, that, although he has had multifarious occupations,
his activity aud zeal for the Arts have not diminished.
