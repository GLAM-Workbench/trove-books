PREFACE.
At the request of numerous friends, I have arranged to publish in
pamphlet form, two speeches delivered by me in the present Parliament
?one in this, the other in the previous session?with the appendices
added. These speeches will, I trust, afford in a complete shape, an
amount of information on the present position of Primary Instruction,
and the state of the law thereon, as may interest the public. The
amended bill to supplement the Education Act, was prepared before I
knew of the existence of a bill with similar principles, introduced and
carried into effect by the British Parliament, in order to provide for
intermediate education in Ireland. This coincidence will, I respectfully
hope, induce my fellow-colonists to regard with an impartial view the
measure I have proposed for acceptance in Victoria. It appears that
statesmen of all shades of opinion in Great Britain and Ireland have
vied with each other in passing into law the Imperial Act.
I trust that a similarly satisfactory result may, shortly, be accom-
plished here ; but to secure so happy an achievement, the public
conscience must be awakened, and public opinion formed, which mav
influence the Legislature to act on the illustrious example given to
it by the wisdom of the Imperial Legislature. Hence, I make this
humble contribution to the solution of the grave question as to the
Elementary Education of the youth of this country, which is still
unsolved.

EDUCATION LAW AMENDMENT BILL.
FIRST NIGHT?S DEBATE.
22 nd October, 1878.
Sir J. O?SHANASSY moved the second reading of this Bill. He
said?Mr. Speaker, before explaining the provisions of the measure, I
wish to state that my intention is to compress my observations within
the smallest possible limit compatible with the importance of the
subject, and the desire I have to fully impress its character on the
minds of honourable members. In the debate upon the vote of the
amount necessary for the maintenance of the present system of State
education, which has lasted for two nights and is not yet closed, I have
taken no part, because I conceive it would not be proper to mix up
the matter I have mainly in my mind, namely, the amendment of the
- educational law of the country, w r ith the mere question of the expen-
diture of the Education department. Last session I took a different
course, because I found that in the three previous years the annual
expenditure of the country upon education, amounting to about half a
million of money, was passed in this Chamber almost sub silentio; and
I may add that I was in hopes that, after what I then said, the Minister
of Public Instruction would not fail this session to afford the amplest
information in his own possession and that of his department relative
to the working of the whole educational system. Having made these
preliminary remarks, I am free to proceed with my present subject,
namely, an explanation of the nature of the measure'l propose. I did
not offer anything of the kind when I introduced the Bill, and it passed
its first reading, because it was a private members? night, and I had to
get the business through in five minutes; so no opportunity for any
observations was afforded me. Since then, however, the Bill has
obtained a wide circulation, and been discussed in many of the journals
of the country, by some in a favourable and by others in a hostile spirit.
I have, however, noticed, with respect to the criticisms of it couched
in a hostile spirit, that not one of the writers of them?l may say the
same of every honourable member of this Chamber who has evinced a
disposition unfavourable to the measure ?seems to have at all rightly
conceived what its object is, or the nature of its leading principles.
Upon those points every journalist or speaker who has in any way
dealt with them disapprovingly seems to have had a foregone conclusion,
and to have discussed collateral issues not at all necessarily pertaining
to the Bill as though he were discussing the Bill itself. Therefore I


ask honourable members, and after them the entire people of Victoria,
to give dispassionate consideration to the short explanation I shall
otfer of the provisions of the measure, for upon our adoption of them,
I firmly believe, depends a very great deal of the future prosperity of
the country. In the first place, the Bill does not propose to interfere
with the existing Education Act, It leaves it, in fact, exactly where
Parliament has left it. It is substantially a supplement to that Act,
Its title denotes that its object is ? to further amend the law relating
to education,? but clause 1 distinctly states?
? Except where the contrary is expressed, nothing herein contained shall affect
the Education Act 1872.?
Clause 2 is as follows :
? This Act shall apply to every school, except as hereinafter provided, of which
the trustees, or if there be no trustees the principal teacher, shall in writing request
the Minister of Public Instruction that such school may be examined in pursuance
of this Act.?
This is a provision under which the trustees, or, if there be no trustees,
the manager, head teacher, or master of a school may apply to the
Minister of Public Instruction for an inspector to be sent by him to
inspect that school. Consequently the Bill starts with placing the
schools to which it refers entirely under the control of the Education
department so far as inspection, and therefore efficiency, is concerned.
Clause 3 says ?
? No school shall be deemed to be within the meaning of this Act in which for
the subjects of reading, writing, and arithmetic ?
To these subjects I will at the proper time add ?grammar and
geography ???accidentally omitted by the draftsman?in order to make
the course of instruction to be imparted in the contemplated schools
identically similar to that of the State schools. The object of the
intended amendment of the clause is that no result fees shall be pay-
able under the Bill unless the instruction is exactly equivalent to the
standards of the Education department. The clause concludes?
? the school fees exceed in the whole the rate of 2s. 6d. for each week for any
single scholar.?
Here the object is that the conductor of a grammar or high school shall
not be enabled by the Bill to ask for result fees. I will mention that
I was speaking the other day on this subject to Professor Irving, who
conducts a high-class school, and I asked him if he would deem it
right, if no contrary provision were made, to apply under the Bill for
result fees ; but he told me promptly that he would do nothing of the
kind, particularly because if he did the prestige of his establishment
?would be at once lowered. The effect of the exception set out in the
clause will undoubtedly be to strictly limit result fees to primary or
elementary schools. Clause 4 provides?
? The Minister of Public Instruction shall cause every school under this Act to he
examined once at least in every year in reading, writing, and arithmetic, in the


same manner and in accordance with the same standard of education as those by
which State schools are then examined.?
In this clause also the words ?grammar and geography have to be
inserted. The provision will give the Minister ot Public Instruction
the complete control over the secular instruction imparted in the
school to which I have already made reference. Clause 5, the princi-
pal clause of the Bill is as follows :
? Out of the moneys provided by Parliament in each year for the P ur P� s
public instruction, anything in the Education Act 1872 to the con rary
standing, there shall be paid to the trustees, or if there ? that
pal teacher of every school so examined, in respect of each educa-
year have passed such examination, a sum equal to the average cost of the educa
tion of a child in the State schools for the year next preceding.
This clause provides that persons conducting schools under the Bill
shall be entitled to receive, for every child passing the examination o
the inspector selected by the Minister of Public Instruction tor the
purpose, in the secular subjects previously mentioned, the exac
amount which the State pays for the education of a child in the same
subjects in the State schools. Of course it will be noticed that the
teachers under the Bill will not be in a position equally satisfactory to
themselves with that occupied by teachers in the State schools, who, by
the way, I notice have recently got their case brought very prominent y
before the House. For example, they will receive nothing from the
State for children who do not pass in the secular subjects. It, out ot
100 children in a school, only 80 pass in the standard subjects, e
State will pay nothing whatever for the balance of 20 children who o
not pass. Again, the trustees or conductors of a school will receive
nothing from the State on account of school buildings or furniture, or
of the books or other requisites that are sent gratis to most State
schools. Furthermore, the teachers in the schools established under
the Bill will get no retiring allowance from the State. So that on
behalf of children who are unable to Join in the State school system
the very smallest possible allowance is asked for ?the most moderate
demand possible is made.
Major SMITH. ?Who will appoint the teachers ?
Sir J. O?SHANASSY. ?The persons who appoint the teachers will
be those who, at their own expense, build the schools and provide
furniture for them, and who also contract with the teachers in them to
pay them, in addition to what their scholars bring in from the State,
enough to raise their salary to the amount they will be fairly entitled
to receive. The second leading proposition in the Bill is contained m
the 6th clause, which is as follows :
? For every scholar from any school under this Act that passes in the University
of Melbourne the matriculation examination, or the examination required for
admission to the civil service, the principal teacher of such school, if such scholar
shall have been in attendance thereat for not less than 12 months next preceding
such examination, shall be entitled to receive out of the moneys aforesaid a bonus
of, in the former case, �lO, and in the latter case of �7 ; provided that not more
than �lO in the whole shall be paid in respect of any scholar who may have
passed both these examinations.?


I don?t think the request embodied in this clause can be regarded
as anything but fair, seeing the great responsibility that will be
thrown upon teachers in schools under this Bill?a responsibility-
far greater than that of the teachers in State schools?by the fact
that inasmuch as the principal portion of their income will
necessarily be derived from passing children in the secular
subjects, it will, of course, be heavily incumbent on them to
pass the greatest number possible; consequently, each of them will, in
order to produce the greatest possible amount of uniformity, in the
shape of good education, among his scholars, have to give a more
undivided attention to his duties, and in fact bestow a greater amount
of labour over the whole of his school, than can generally be expected,
under the present system, from the State school teacher, who is not
only paid by results, but provided with a residence, or an allowance in
lieu of one, and also an allowance for the number of children enrolled
for average attendance. Possessing none of the latter advantages, the
teachers in the schools under the Bill will have, in order to maintain
their position, to bring their scholars up to a generally higher standard
of education than State school teachers as a rule aim at. There is
another reason why the success of schools under the Bill is likely to be
greater than that generally achieved in State schools, namely, that, in
addition to the motive for extra strenuous exertion on the part of the
teacher to which I have alluded, the parents having to pay school
fees will render the attendance of the children more regular, and
this is proved by the Education Eeport. Of course a teacher can
always operate more successfully where the children?s attendance
is constant than where it is irregular?a frequent case in State
schools. Do we not know that, with respect to the latter, if a
child attends only one day in the year he swells the number
enrolled, which is the basis of a portion of the State school teacher?s
income as average attendance, and is also counted among the children
of the country receiving education from the State. With regard to
the 6th clause it is to be observed that there are not what may be
called high or intermediate schools in the country beyond two or three
grammar schools, and above them the University. I certainly think
that the provision that a teacher in any school under the Bill should be
entitled to receive �lO for every one of his scholars who passes the
University matriculation examination, and �7 for every one who
passes the civil service examination, not more than �lO being paid for
any scholar who passes in both, will constitute a fair and praiseworthy
encouragement to him to endeavour to add to his income from that
source. At present our State school system provides exhibitions for
children exclusively taught in the State schools ; but it appears to me,
as one of the general community, that, in view of the large number of
the children of the country who are brought up outside those schools,
the plan is, on the part of the State, a hardly defensible one. If the
State really desires that all children should aspire to pass these high
examinations, I want to know why the exhibitions alluded to should
not be open to children educated elsewhere than in the State schools ?
It for children to obtain the higher education, and achieve the higher


?development, is something so much for the advantage of the community
that the State encourages it with respect to its own scholars, why
should it refuse an equal encouragement to children attending schools
that do not belong to the State ? For this injustice, which may or
may not be intentional, but which undoubtedly exists, the clause I am
referring to provides a remedy. Clause 7 provides the following:?
? In the case of schools situated in thinly populated districts, the Governor in
?Council may, if he think fit, order that every scholar passing any such examination
as aforesaid may he counted as though he were two or any such higher number as
the Governor in Council may think that the exigency of the case requires, and
?every such order shall be published in the Government Gazette, and may from time
be varied or repealed.?
The object of this clause is that the parents in country and possibly
poor districts, who cannot afford to send their children to the higher
schools, or to the University, shall, if they wish them to receive the
higher kind of instruction, not be placed at a disadvantage as com-
pared with parents in Melbourne, or other comparatively wealthy
centres of population. Here again the Bill gives the Government
entire control in matters purely secular. The other portions of the
Bill relate altogether to matters of detail, and I will not trouble
honourable members by reading them over. They deal with the
duties of inspectors, and give certain powers to the Minister of
Public Instruction respecting inspectors? reports and other matters.
It will be observed that the Bill sets no limit to the number of
children who may attend any school, and the omission is intentional.
Whether there ought to be any such limit is left open for discussion by
honourable members. I find that under the Education Act there is
no limit whatever. A State school may have only two, three, four, or
nine or ten pupils. Any one looking over the appendices to the
Education report will see that there are a vast number of schools with an
attendance of pupils to only some such extent Schools have, in fact,
been built, or portable schools have been sent, wherever the Minister
of Public Instruction has thought proper. Even in schools built of
brick the number of pupils is, in some cases, no more than what I now
indicate. I have received a letter from the Bishop of Sandhurst, in which
he points out four such thinly attended schools, consisting of two, five,
six, and eight scholars respectively, with high-salaried teachers, erected
at great cost, in a district where there are 221 scholars going to Catholic
schools. It must be borne in mind that the Education department is
wholly uncontrolled by the House in the matter of erecting schools.
Wherever a superior officer of the department has thought proper, or an
influential deputation to the Minister of Public Instruction have urged
that the thing should be done, a school has been built. Ho effort has yet
been made by the House to check the multiplication of such extravagant
-establishments. 1 was not a member of this branch of the Legislature
when the Education Act was passed, but I know that one of the
strongest points then put forward in its favour was the alleged
necessity that existed for the abolition of small schools situated near
each other ?of the state of things under which numbers of small
schools belonging to different denominations were often found in the


same locality. So far as matters have gone, however, it would seem
that during the five years in which the Act has been in operation a
very contrary result has been achieved. For instance, there has been
a multiplication of schools in neighbourhoods where they are not
absolutely required, simply in order to substantially damage Catholic
schools by inducing parents to withdraw their children from them. I
don?t, however, say that that has been the primary motive in connexion
with the erection of every school of the kind I refer to. At the
same time, the thing is done. When, the other day, we had the Loan
Bill before us, I made a proposition to the effect that, with regard to
the item of �200,000 for the erection of school buildings throughout
the country, the Minister of Public Instruction should place before us
every year a scheme setting forth the schools he intended to establish,
so that the House might have some absolute knowledge of what he
was doing. _ .
Major SMITH. ?And I expressed my willingness to give the
information.
Sir J. O?SHAHASSY.?I am aware the honourable gentlemen
did so. I think a perusal of the appendices to the report will convince
every one that it is absolutely necessary there should be some check
upon the extravagance of the Education department. On the other
hand, the Catholic body erect a school only where there is a sufficient
number of children to support it, and when it is erected the rule is for
all the Catholic children in the neighbouring State schools to imme-
diately leave them and come to the Catholic school. They leave the
grand schools erected by the State, although the instruction there is
free, and the buildings are fitted with all manner of appurtenances and
accommodation, and go to the school of their own denomination, where
school fees have to be paid, simply because by so doing they comply
with the feelings and convictions of their parents. For at
Crossley, in the western district, there is a State school, the erection
of which cost, lam told, �3,000; yet, directly a Catholic school was
established there, 200 children at once entered upon attendance at it,
leaving 50 children in the State school. And this is of constant
occurrence in other parts of the country. What does all this prove ?
It proves that the Minister of Public Instruction has thoroughly mis-
conceived the feelings and objects of the majority of parents in centres
of population of a mainly Catholic character. The result is that he
has wasted a large amount of public money in the erection of perfectly
unnecessary State schools. I don?t like to see that sort of thing going
on ; and one of the objects of the Bill is to put a stop to the needless
expenditure of public money the sort of double action I am referring
to involves. I will naturally be asked on what grounds I have framed
and introduced this measure. I beg to call the attention of the House
to the fact that in 1872, when the Education Bill was before this
Chamber, a vast number of petitions of a thoroughly representative
character ?from the highest authorities in the Catholic church here,
down to the humblest labouring man belonging to it?were presented
to Parliament, pointing out that the system about to be established,
was one the petitioners could not avail themselves of, because their


religious convictions, and in fact everything they held sacred and dear,,
prohibited them from so doing. Instead, however, of making provision
for the continuance of the schools in which instruction was received by
the Catholic children of the country, the Assembly contented itself
with inserting in the measure then under consideration the following
provision :
? The trustees, committee of management, or correspondent, as the case may be,,
of every non-vested school receiving aid from the Board of Education at the com-
mencement of this Act, shall be entitled to receive for the free education of
children attending such school in the subjects specified in the Ist schedule hereto,
a sum equivalent to what such school would receive if it were a State school until
the Ist January, 1874, and no longer. After that period, in localities where there
may be no State schools, or an insufficient number, and then only until State
schools can be established, an arrangement may be made with any non-vested
school for the free education of children in the subjects specified in the Ist schedule
hereto for a sum to be agreed upon at a capitation rate, not exceeding the average-
cost of such education in the nearest State school ; but no such arrangement shall
be entered into or continue after a period of five years from the commencement of
this Act.?
The present Bill is practically the consequence of the state of things
so established. In the face of the petitions I allude to, containing as
they did perhaps the most solemn asservations ever made to the-
JParliament of Victoria, and notwithstanding the well-known fact that
the Catholic schools indicated included many educational establish-
ments that had been in existence from the foundation of the colony?
establishments which had been all along patronized by the State, under
whose auspices persons had from time to time been induced to subscribe
large sums for building and maintenance purposes in connexion with
them?and that in them education had been so satisfactorily conducted,
that the average of scholars passing in the standard subjects was
frequently 98 out of 100, what did Parliament do? They reciprocated
the care and attention thus bestowed in order to give the State a whole
generation of good citizens, by aiming a deadly blow at every institu-
tion of the kind ?by absolutely prescribing each and all of them from
receiving, after a certain date, any assistance whatever from the State..
Eor what offence was this the punishment? What crime had the
Catholics of Victoria committed ? What wrong had they done to
society? The proceeding could not be justified on the score of
economy, because, as a matter of fact, under the old system the State
did not practically contribute towards its support so much as the
parents did. So far as the Catholic body was concerned, a more
economical or efficient system could not possibly exist. No complaint
whatever was made against the Catholic schools on the ground of'
impropriety, or inefficiency. Nothing of the kind was ever heard of.
Well, Parliament having, after all the share the Catholic portion of the
community?there is nothing of which I, personally, am more proud?
had taken in fighting the battle of perfect religious liberty and equality
until the principle was thoroughly embodied in the law of the laud,,
declared by this single section of the Education Act that at the end .
of five years their schools should be proscribed, and, in fact, not
allowed to have any existence at all; the period so named has elapsed*


.and we have now to look at things as they stand. Eor what has it all
been done? Heasons have been asked for again and again, but none
have been g'ven. The Catholic may hold, as a citizen and a Christian,
without public offence or error, it may be hoped, the language of the
sage who says with the poet ?
? His aspirations
Have been beyond the dwellers of the earth,
And they have taught him what we know?
That knowledge is not happiness, and science
But an exchange of ignorance
For that which is another kind of ignorance.?
Thus Satan has a fine intellect, but not the image of God. Tor
all practical purposes the Catholics of Victoria are driven by the
Education Act of 1872 to a position below that which their brethren
in Great Britain occupied when they were emancipated by the Imperial
Parliament. So far as the law can make them so, they are serfs in a
free country. State aid to the Catholic schools ended, as I have
already stated, on the 31st December last. They were then not
exactly exterminated, but the plan was rather to force them out of
existence by the starving process. I have a return here which shows
the amounts that have been paid to capitation schools in the colony
in connection with the Catholic denomination since 1874 the
Education Act came into force on January 1, 1873 ?and it sets forth
the following sums :
1874 ... ... ... ... ... �29.925 11 2
1875 ... ... ... ... ... 22,464 2 2
1876 17,423 18 10
1877 ... ... ... ... ... 11,532 1 0
Total �81,345 13 2
In that gradual way was State aid to these schools withdrawn. On
the other hand, I must in fairness mention that State aid was also
taken away under similar circumstances from the schools of the other
denominations of the country. These bodies, however, fell in with the
State system without complaint. I find that the money received from
-the State for educational purposes by the other denominations during
the same four years amounts to about �lO,OOO. But what did the
State do for its own schools during that period ? I think the answer
to that query will rather astonish the people of the country. Certainly
it will astonish honourable members who have not attended closely to the
?matter, or noticed the scope of the public expenditure in this direction.
I have a return, supplied me from the Education department, which
shows the amounts expended upon its own schools by the State since
-January 1, 1873, and it gives the following figures :
Expended by the State?
Exclusive of buildings ...
�2,192,727 16 6
898,241 7 2
Upon buildings
Total
�3,090,969 3 8


In addition, we have to reckon the value of all the common school
buildings that became the property of the State when the Education
Act received the Koyal assent, and also the interest paid on the-
�6oo,ooo we have borrowed for school-building purposes?about
�48,000 or �50,000. So that while the State has expended on salaries,,
buildings, and other expenses in connection with its schools for the
children of all the denominations in the country save the Catholics a
sum of about �3,150,000, it has given aid to the schools of the latter
body, who constitute one-fourth of the population, to the extent of only
�81,345. Yet who will deny that had the educational aid granted to
the Catholics since January 1, 1873, been proportionate to their
numerical and tax-paying position in the community, it would have
amounted to at least �600,000 or �700,000; or that, after making every
possible allowance with respect to Catholic children sent to State
schools, because there were none others open to them, the denomina-
tion may be said to have suffered plunder?to use a mild phrase?to
the extent of at least �500,000 ? This, then, is the financial view of
the case, and the facts I have stated cannot be got oyer. This expen-
diture is likely to proceed on the same basis, but with a more unjust
result, because, whereas the Catholic schools received �BI,OOO from the
State during a period of four or five years, since the Ist of January last
they have not obtained, and will not in future obtain, one penny. I
presume that the expenditure on the State system of education will go
on at the rate of something like �500,000 to �600,000 per annum, if
not more, and every year the grievance of those who are now com-
plaining will be added to, unless an alteration is made. No one,
however, seems disposed to suggest any means by which a remedy may
be applied. Last year I called attention to the extraordinary state of
things existing with all the ability I could, and asked the Minister of
Public Instruction if he would bring in a Bill to amend the law ; but I
received no very definite reply. The honourable gentleman seemed to-
be under the impression that if he only remained quiet ?did nothing?
the Catholic schools would gradually die out of existence, and no
further demand would be made on the Government. A whole year has
since elapsed without anything being done, and the Minister appears
inclined to pursue the same policy. It therefore cannot be said that I
have acted very precipitately in now bringing forward a practical
measure to deal with the subject. If the Government, or any member
of the House, can point out a more practical remedy ?one more
calculated to effect the object in view, which is to do justice?l will
unhesitatingly withdraw my measure in favour of any such proposal.
I am not wedded entirely to this particular Bill, for it does not propose
to do all that strict equality demands; but I am wedded to it
until I see some practical outcome of it. Now'that public opinion is
roused and seised of the actual state of the case, it is impossible that
the grievance can be allowed to continue without some remedy being
attempted. Having dealt with the financial portion of the subject, I
now come to a matter which, I regret to say, will not be very pleasant
to the Minister of Public Instruction. The honourable gentleman
threw out a challenge the other night, and consequently I w'as obliged


to examine more closely than I otherwise would have done into the
sources of the information which he brought under the notice of the
House. The honourable gentleman made a statement, which he said
was based on Mr. Hayter?s statistics, to the effect that there are only
115 Roman Catholic schools (four only having been added within the
last year) in this country, having only 15,000 children on the rolls.
From this he concluded that the grievance complained of by the
Catholic body has no real basis, no real existence, that it is only a cry
?a religious sentiment ?and that it will die out. If, said the honour-
able gentleman, those whom this section of the community are bound
to respect as their teachers in faith and morals would just keep them-
selves quiet, and let the Catholic people alone?though it is their duty
to advise and instruct them?the whole complaint would be at an end,
Catholic and Protestant children would sit together in the State schools,
and everything would go on swimmingly. The Minister, however, has
since received a reply from the Catholic bishop of his own district,
Ballarat, which convicts him conclusively out of his own mouth, by
showing that in that district alone numerous schools have been
established within the year. But I do not intend to rest myself on
that, I will go straight to Hayter and see what he says. I will read
a letter I wrote to Mr. Hayter and the reply I have received, which
shows that the honourable gentleman actually suppressed the facts
?that he had not the candour to acknowledge the real state of
the case.
Major SMITH.?I did not suppress the the facts.
Sir J. O?SHAN ASST. ?Then if the honourable gentleman did not
do so he was, as the Minister of Public Instruction, extremely ignorant
on the subject. I was invited most courteously by the honourable
gentleman, a few nights ago, to take part in the debate on the educa-
tion vote, but I declined his overtures. I am not disposed on every
occasion to accept his invitation. I can wait patiently. After the
honourable gentleman?s speech, I wrote the following letter to Mr.
Hayter, dated Parliament-house, October 17 :
� Will you oblige me by informing me under what legal authority you collect the
statistics with regard to private schools, or schools not receiving aid from the
State? In your memo, read last night by the Minister of Instruction reference
was therein made to ? collectors.? Will you be good enough to explain who are
those collectors, by whom they are employed, and how their returns are checked,
as I understood from you some time ago that the collectors were chosen by the
local bodies, but that there was no check on their returns ? I also desire to know
the number of collectors so chosen by the local bodies, and also how many of the
local bodies, town and country, do not appoint collectors. With this information
supplied as now requested, I presume I may say that you have no certain or
accurate system of obtaining, legally or otherwise, the exact state of the numbers
of children attending the private or other schools of the colony, I assume that you
do not obtain any returns in the foregoing cases from the Education department.
Please say if I am correct, or, if I am not, how far can you use them to aid you in
dealing with the collectors? returns ? ?
To tbis letter I received a reply from the Government Statist, to
which I beg the particular attention of the House, for it contains
information which was just as available to the Minister of Public


Instruction as it was to myself. Mr. Hayter?s letter, dated the 18th
of October, is as follows :
? I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th instant,
and to reply as follows :
? 1. The returns of private schools situated within municipalities, except in the
case of Melbourne and Geelong, are collected by the local bodies under section 494.
of the Local Government Statute (No. 506), which prescribes that??The council
?of every municipality shall, on or before the 31st March in each year, furnish to
the Government Statist of Victoria such agricultural and other statistics relating
to the municipal district, and on such forms and in such manner as the Governor
in Council may direct.?
?2. Melbourne and Geelong, not being under the Local Government Act, are
not obliged to furnish statistics. The Government therefore appoint persons
specially to collect the returns of establishments situated therein ; also of estab-
lishments situated in those parts of the country which are outside the limits of
local jurisdiction.
? The total number of collectors engaged is not known to this department. Each
municipality employs at least one, but large shires have two, and sometimes three
or more. Six collectors were appointed by the Government to gather the returns
for 1877-8 of places outside the jurisdiction of the Local Government Act.
? 4. As the returns supplied by local bodies are to be furnished not only ? on such
forms,? but ? in such manner as the Governor in Council may direct,? instructions are
issued to the collectors, a copy of which is enclosed. It will be observed that the
direction respecting private schools is embodied in the 22nd clause of the document.
? 5. The correctness of the information supplied is verified by the signatures of
persons in charge of establishments, which are obtained in most cases, but cannot
he in quite all. The department is not able to ensure that every establishment is
visited until such establishment has been once returned. After this has been done,
care is always taken that it shall not be missed in the future, which is effected by
collating the returns of one year with those of the previous one, when the absence
of any returns is at once observed and is immediately reported to the municipal
authorities.
? Ever since the passing of the present Education Act I have felt that there was
a danger of some of those private schools being missed which were formerly con-
nected with the State, and have therefore cautioned the collectors on the subject.
In spite of every care, however, I am by no means certain that the fact of a school?s
estate connexion having determined has been always recognized by the collectors.
The heads of some of the denominations have helped me by supplying the lists of
the schools which they claimed as attached to their body, and if all would do so it
would be easy to see that every school was returned.?
Major SMITH.?Why don?t they all do it ?
Sir J, O?SHAH ASSY.?The whole object of getting a return from
clergymen is to check the returns furnished by the collectors. Where
it is not obtained the collectors are under no check, and consequently
Mr, Hayter must take their statistics for what they are worth. The
letter further says ;
? 8. All returns of schools having any connexion with the State, as for example
capitation schools, the grants to which were continued to the end of 1877, are sup-
plied by the Education department, and it is no part of the collectors? duty to
gather information respecting such schools.?
In the number of Eoman Catholic schools mentioned by the Minister
of Public Instruction not one of the capitation schools is included, and
a great many others are left out. How the case which the Minister
attempted to make out breaks down will be further seen from the fol-
lowing paragraph, with which Mr. Hayter?s letter concludes :


?I should explain that the scholars on the rolls of private schools, as published!
by me, are those attached to the school at the time of the collector?s visit, and are
but little, if at all, in excess of the average numbers attending. This being the
case, they compare more nearly with the numbers in average attendance at the
State schools than with those on the rolls, since the latter embrace all the children
whose names may appear on the roll of a State school during any portion of the
year, although some may have actually attended for a very short period only.?
Therefore the Minister, in stating that the number of children attend-j
ing Catholic schools is only 15.000, did not explain the distinction
between the roll as made up by Mr, Hayter and the State school roll'i
submitted to Parliament. The State school attendance is made up by
including every child, however short may be the period he has attended.
If a child has only attended one day in the year he appears as enrolled
for the whole year.
Mr. MACKAY. ?No, that is not so.
Sir J. O?SHAN ASSY. ?Although the honourable member for Sand-
hurst (Mr. Mackay), who has been Minister of Public Instruction,,
contradicts me, I have taken the trouble to go to Mr. Hayter, and he
writes under his own hand the statement which I have just quoted. I
have also taken the trouble to go to the Education department. The-
collectors necessarily take the number of children at school as they
find them at the schools about which they collect statistics, but the
State schoolmaster keeps a roll of the children who attend his school
de die in diem, and if a child only comes one day he appears as enrolled,
for the whole year in the returns furnished by the Education,
department, and from these rolls the average attendance is made out?
a totally different plan from Mr. Hayter?s mode of making up his rolls,
as shown already. This is clearly shown by Mr. Hayter?s letter, The
Minister of Public Instruction either suppressed this fact or he did
not know it. If he did not know it, what is the use of his being
in office as Minister ? Another remarkable circumstance is that Mr.
Hayter appended a note to the return which he furnished to the
Minister stating that the figures he supplied were not to be taken as
correct.
Major SMITH.?I said so.
Sir J. O?SHANASSY. ?I do not find the statement in the
honourable gentleman?s speech. That explanation having been fur-
nished by Mr. Hayter, why did the Minister make so much of the
allegation that there are only 15,000 children attending Catholic
schools ?
Major SMITH. ?I gave it for what it is worth.
Sir J. O?SHANASSY. ?That is certainly not much, seeing that he
allowed it to be the total number enrolled instead of the average atten-
dance as taken by the collectors. Then again, it was the duty of the
Minister, instead of hiding himself behind Hayter, to have seen that
the law was complied with. The 10th section of the Education Act
Amendment Act says ?
? The proprietor, principal, head master, or principal teacher of every school for
the education of children not being a htate school or Sunday school shall, in the
month of January in each year, furnish to the Education department a return


showing the name and surname, sex, age last birthday, residence, and number of
school days attendance of each child who attended his school during the preceding-
year ; and if such proprietor, principal, head master, or principal teacher refuse or
neglect to furnish such return he shall be guilty of an offence against this Act, and
may be summoned by any person authorized by the Minister before a justice, and
on conviction forfeit and pay a sum not exceeding �5.?
The Minister did not say a word, throughout the whole of his long
speech, in reference to the statistical information which this section
requires shall be furnished to himself. Hayter has no legal power
to get any return directly. I went to the Secretary of the .Education
department and asked for the returns under this section, but I was
informed that, although notices were published in all the local papers
in December last, calling upon the proprietors of schools and others
to comply with the section, they are never prosecuted for not complying
with it, and the result is that in many cases no returns are received by
the department. Now, what does the report of the department state
on this subject ? It says ?
? The department has been unfortunate in its endeavours to obtain accurate
returns of the number of children of school age in the colony, and of the extent to
which such children are being educated. On the passing of the Education Act
Amendment Act, 1876, steps were at once taken to compile a roll of children
between school ages for each school district, as required by section 7 of that Act;
but owing to the necessity for exercising economy, and to the high rates asked in
many districts for the performance of the work, a considerable time elapsed before
reasonable tenders could be obtained in all cases. The collection of the census was
thus extended over a long period. The work, too, was not accomplished in a
thorough manner, as the returns when summarized were found to account for only
about five-sixths of the children known to be living in the colony. The experience
thus gained has shown that a satisfactory school census can only be obtained either
by a large expenditure of money, or by a system of compulsory registration, as
recommended by Professor Pearson.?
The Minister, however, ignored his own report, and coolly quoted
information supplied by Mr. Hayter which has not yet been formally
published, and thought that in doing so he scored a great triumph. I
asked the Secretary of the Education department to furnish me with
what information the department could supply as to the attendance of
children at private schools, and this is his reply :
?The number of private schools in Victoria from which returns of attendance were
received by this department for the year 1877 was 436. The number of children in
attendance?under 6 years of age, 2,755 ; over 6 and under 15, 18,066 ; over 15
years of age, 2,635 ; ages not stated, 1,134 ; total number returned, 24,580.?
On the other hand, Mr. Hayter gives the number of schools as
530, with 28,422 children. Under the circumstances, as I was
unable to obtain accurate information from either the Education
department or the department of the Government Statist, what
was I to do in order to endeavour to get at the real facts ? I
could do nothing more than put myself in communication with
the persons who are conducting Catholic schools, and get returns
from them. From the returns which have been sent to me,
instead of the number of Catholic schools being 115 with 15,000
scholars on the rolls ?though the Minister in mentioning that number
2


should really have spoken of it as the average attendance?l find the
real state of the case is very different. I have the name of every
school, so that my statement can be verified if necessary. The actual
number of Catholic schools in the colony is 164, whilst the scholars
in average attendance number 15,276, or an average of 94 for each
school. Within the last few minutes I have received a telegram
informing me that another Catholic school has just been opened in
Portland with 50 scholars, and with every prospect of being a perma-
nent school. The average attendance at the 164 schools being 94,
shows that the Catholic schools are large, and that they form a very
important element in the education of the country, and they are
certain to multiply.
Major SMITH.?What is the age of the children ?
Sir J. O?SHANASSY.?That is also a matter on which it will not
be very pleasant for the Minister of Public Instruction to receive infor-
mation. The children attending these schools are nearly all within the
legal school age?that is to say, more than six years old?and the
reason is that, as all the children attending these schools have to be paid
for by their parents, the parents, being principally poor persons, will
not pay fees unnecessarily by sending their children to school when
they are too young to learn anything. Consequently the proportion
of children above six years of age who attend Catholic schools is a great
deal more than the proportion above that age who attend the State
schools. Many of the children who attend the State schools are
between three and six years years old, but what can a child who is only
three or four years of age learn at school ? I suppose such children
are sent there to be out of the way, and that they fall asleep most of
the day. They, however, help to swell the returns, and to show what
a glorious system the State school system is. But after the expenditure
of millions of money in order to provide free education, what is really
the result? Why, the average attendance at each school of children
of six years of age and upwards, excluding the attendance at night
schools, is only 66 ; so that the Catholic schools ?unaided by the State,
and compelled, in fact, to fight against the system maintained solely at
the expense of the State?actually beat the State schools in average
attendance by nearly 50 per cent. In order to test the accuracy of the
statistics of the Education department and of Mr. Hayter's statistics,
I applied to both departments to ascertain what information they had
received concerning the attendance at nine Catholic schools, which I
selected from my returns. They are all in the Ballarat district. The
question I put was, whether returns had been received as to these nine
schools, and I found that the Education department had not received
returns in reference to the following schools : ?Redan (Ballarat), with
459 scholars on the roll; St. Alipius?s (Ballarat East), with 302
scholars; St. Joseph?s (Ballarat), with about 350; Warrenheip and
Warrenheip Junction; Derwent Jack?s, with 97 children; and
Haddon school, with 71. Returns as to the Coghlen (Leigh Creek)
school, with 93 scholars on the roll, and Palmer?s Gully school, with
246, had been received by the Education department. Of the nine
schools, the Education department had received returns from two only.


while Mr. Hayter had received returns from four only. These nine
schools had near 2,000 children attending. This is an illustration of
the incorrect and incomplete system on which the statistics given by
the Minister of Public Instruction are based, as is more clearly shown
by the following return prepared by Mr. Hayter: ?
VICTORIA.
According to the proportions prevailing at the last census, the mean number of
children at school age (6?14) last birthday in the colony during 1877, was
198,431.
The number of children of all ages on the rolls of the schools during the year,
was as follows :
Public Schools. 1877 Private Schools.
Number on the rolls ... 234,519 Number on rolls 31st March, 1877 28,847
Number in average attendance 116,015 Do do 1878 28,422
Number of distinct children
(estimated) ... ... 194,994 Mean ... ... ... 28,634
ROMAN CATHOLICS.
Number of children of school age in 1877 in the colony, according to the
proportions at last census : ?53,475.
Number of Roman Catholic children of all ages that should be at school if they
attended in the same ratio as average attendance in public schools, added to mean
number in private schools, viz., 144,649: ?38,981.
But their enrolment in their own schools is made, as already pointed
out, in a different manner to enrolment in the State schools. Payment
by parents induces a larger number in regular attendance?hence,
15.000 in Catholic schools will show that number in average atten-
dance to 20,000 enrolled according to their method, whilst, according
to the State school system, it would show 28,000 to 30,000;
allowing, however, that of the 38,981 some ten thousand may fairly be
deducted for children withdrawn by poor parents, who, desiring their
labour, cannot send them continuously to school for a period of nine
years ?that is, between the legal age of 6 and 15, as also for the
numbers privately educated by tutors in families, as well as by some
parents, and from other causes, the numbers- can be easily stated as
about 28,000 Catholic children, and we thus at a glance see that as
20.000 of these are enrolled in Catholic schools, the vast preponderating
opinion of Catholic parents is shown to favour sending their children
to schools supported by themselves, and thus the plea that individual
Catholics send children to the State schools has no value and cannot
in fairness be used for the injustice existing by the State school
system. Of course no person could expect that the whole number of
38,981 children should be at school every day, or even be enrolled for
the reasons stated by me. I, however, do not wish to rest my
<jase upon a mere question of statistics. Macaulay?who will be
admitted to be a higher authority than the Minister of Public
Instruction, or even than this House ?says ? the intensity of the
suffering which a measure inflicts must be taken into considera-
tion, as well as the number of the sufferers.? Even if the
number of persons who complain of the grievance under which
they suffer by the Education Act was not large, that would be
no reason for refusing justice to them. It is of no use saying?? 0h >


several children belonging to Catholic parents go to State schools,
ergo the Catholics have no grievance; their so-called grievance is a mere
sentimental thing got up by the clergy.? I have heard such state-
ments made a thousand times, but what is the value of them ? They
have been repeatedly refuted. It is no new right that the Catholic-
portion of the community are now claiming, but a right which was
broken by an Act of Parliament, the Education Act. They are only
asking for a renewal of what they formerly had, or something like it.
They are appealing to be placed in a position of equality with the
other portions of the community of which they form a part. That is a
much more substantial line of argument than any based on mere
numbers. Because some Catholic children, or the children of parents
one of whom may be a Catholic and the other a Protestant, go to State
schools, that is no proof that the parents in general have not conscien-
tious objections to the State system of education. There is no more
foundation for that argument than there would be for saying that
because a man breaks the Ten Commandments, therefore he disapproves
of the Ten Commandments. Having explained the grounds upon
w r hich I have introduced my Bill, and the basis of the demand made
by the Catholic community for some relief in this matter, I will now
deal with some of the objections which will no doubt be raised to the
measure. The first objection will probably be that it will break up
the State system of education, created at a great outlay, and in many
instances render useless the school buildings which have been erected.
I have shown already that many of the buildings are now useless, and
that more will become so as the Catholic schools are
Hence the objection appears to me to have no weight whatever. The
second objection will most likely be that the Bill, if passed, will
restore denominationalism and its extreme costliness, which the State
system was avowedly established to save. It will be said that if what
the measure proposes is given to one denomination of Christians, all
other denominations will naturally demand the same right. (?Hear,
hear.?) I know that will be said, and therefore I might as well meet
it boldly at once. lam in a position to show that there is not the
slightest foundation for this statement. In the first place, the Bill
does not propose to give a shilling to religion?there is not one word
in the measure about religion. It simply proposes that payment
shall be given for secular instruction?for instruction in reading,,
writing, arithmetic, grammar, and geography. The State is merely
asked to pay for results in these subjects as ascertained upon the
examination of the children by an inspector appointed by the State.
There is no question of denominationalism either in the Bill or in my
mind. The teacher of secular subjects is to be paid only for his
work, and no denomination is recognized and no payment is to be made
to any minister of religion. He is not known in the Bill. Thus
truth, like light, travels in straight lines, and this objection fails.
It is said, however, that if a measure of this kind be passed,
other religious denominations besides the Catholics will claim to come
under its provisions. If such is the case, is it not proof that they are
now under a coercive system which they do not like, and from which.


they will escape whenever they get the opportunity of doing so ? But
what are the facts? How many private schools have the other
? denominations at the present time. In 1877 the Church of England
had 47 schools, 210 teachers, and 1,730 scholars. Here is a body
including half the population of the country, and probably the richest
portion, which, after the Education Act has been five years in
operation, has in existence only this small number of private schools,
"Will any sensible man say that, if this Bill becomes law, the Church
of England will immediately commence to build schools all over the
country to enable them to come under the provisions of the measure?
No member of the House would have the effrontery to maintain such
a proposition. Nothing of the kind, in fact, would happen. The
Bishop of Melbourne (Dr. Moorhouse), who is the head of the Church
of England demomination in Victoria, has given expression to his views
on the subject, and he asks for nothing of the kind. He is dissatisfied
with the present educational system because religious instruction is
not given in the State schools, and he wishes a remedy to be provided
by having a book of religious lessons, to be approved of by both
branches of the Legislature, and then to be used and taught by the
teachers in the State schools. There has been no desire, expressed or
implied, on behalf of the Church of England to erect more schools ;
nor, if the Bill becomes law, will that body be likely to erect another
school in consequence thereof. As far as half the population of the
colony is concerned, I think, therefore, I may fairly say they have no
intention of coming under the provisions of the measure for any
new schools. The teachers of existing may if they like apply as for
private schools, and so with others, which is but fair and just. They
would be very heavily handicapped if they did anything of the kind.
It would cost them a large sum of money to put themselves in the
position which those who are crying for relief by means of this Bill
have placed themselves in by the sacrifices they have made for con-
science sake. Dr. Moorhouse has pointed out that there is not the
'same religious obligation on the part of the members of the Church
of England as there is upon Catholics, with the views which they hold
upon the question of education. All that he asks for is that Scriptural
lessons, approved of by the Legislature, shall be taught in the State
: schools; and he is quite willing, as I understand, that there shall be a
conscience clause, similar to what is in operation in England, in order
to meet the case of any persons who may object to their children
receiving such lessons. This Bill was dratted in April last, and I was
not aware of the views of Dr. Moorhouse until they were publicly
expressed after the first reading of the measure. It, therefore, cannot
>be said that I have attempted to meet the Bishop?s views. Ido not
know that I am called upon individually to ask for legislation on
behalf of the Church of England. That Church is a large and
influential body, with intellectual and powerful advocates, who are
quite able to put their view of the case forward; but it will be time
? enough to deal with that branch of the subject when it is before us.
At present it is not before us. It is evident, however, that Dr.
Moorhouse feels acutely the disadvantages of the State system of


education; and, as a colonist of forty years? standing, I must say that
his manly, outspoken sentiments on this subject, and his demand for
justice, both for his own body and for the Koman Catholics, entitle
him to the -warmest praise. Of Dr. Moorhouse, to use the language
of the poet, I will say?
?An honest man?s the noblest work of God.?
The next leading denomination I will refer to is the Presbyterian body,
which, in 1877, had 4 schools, 32 teachers, and 633 scholars. This
body is nearly equal to the Eoman Catholics in numbers. In the
face of these figures, can any one say that, in the event of this Bill
becoming law, the Presbyterians'are likely to go back to the building
of denominational schools, handicapped as they will be if they do so ?
Are they likely to turn away from the system which they have
accepted for the last five years uncomplainingly, as far as I know, with-
out ever petitioning against it p No reasonable man can say that any-
thing of the kind will occur. It is only a pretence ?a pretext put
forward in opposition to the Bill?to say that, if the measure becomes
law, it will break up the State system of education and restore denomi-
nationalism. The Wesleyans are a body of great organizing power,
and very attentive to education, whether religious or secular. They are
entitled to great credit for their zeal and energy. In 1877 they had 7
schools, 19 teachers, and 333 scholars. They, too, have availed them-
selves of the State school system, and are apparently well satisfied with
it, as they have never complained. Is it likely, therefore, that this
body will attempt to erect new schools, in order to take advantage of
the Bill ? Ido not think any member will reply to the question in the
affirmative, though I believe there are 19 or 20 gentlemen in this
House who are connected with the Wesleyan body. The Independents,
in 1876, had 1 school, 1 teacher, and 20 scholars; and in 1877 they
had none. I take it that they are really so independent that they have
connected themselves with the State system absolutely for ever. The
Lutherans, in 1877, had 3 schools, 4 teachers, and 142 scholars. Pro-
testant denominations undefined had 7 schools, 10 teachers, and 123
scholars; whereas, in 1876, they had 9 schools, 27 teachers, and 338
scholars. In 1876 the Jews had 2 schools, 10 teachers, and 270
scholars ; and in 1877 they had 4 schools, 13 teachers, and 293 scholars.
Now all these existing schools may get the benefits proposed by the Bill.
Very great anxiety has been expressed for the religious scruples of the
Jew r s ; and that modern Pope, as I may call him, the honourable
member for East Bourke, has undertaken the expurgation of a whole
series of school books on their behalf when he was Minister of Educa-
tion. No one is more desirous than lam to see that nothing is
done to offend the religious convictions and conscientious objections
of that body. I have made inquiries of a Hebrew friend of mine,
and I find that the Jews, though an energetic and wealthy body, feel
themselves very much hampered by having to maintain their schools ;
nevertheless they have not hitherto mixed themselves up much with
the State system, though, if this Bill passes, they will avail themselves
of it. Of private schools not enumerated as belonging to any religious


denomination there were 474 in the year 1876, having 1,019 teachers,
and 12,397 scholars ; whereas in 1877 the number was only 343, with
824 teachers, and 9,537 scholars. Many of these schools will no
doubt come under my Bill. Amongst these schools are included
20 private Catholic schools, conducted by individuals, having about 600
scholars, which, under the provisions of this Bill, would be entitled to
claim payment from the State for secular results. I think I have
shown that there is no foundation for the idea that if the State does
justice to one religious body by paying teachers appointed by their
authority for secular results, all other religious bodies, some of
which have abandoned their schools, will cease to avail themselves
of the State system and establish schools of their own in order
that they may come under the Bill. There is no foundation
for that argument except a craze in the brain of some of those
who object to justice being done to a body who hold totally
different views on the subject of elementary education from those held
by other religious denominations; who do nob hold, as Catholics
hold, to the principle of a combined religious and secular system
of education in the school. The third objection raised to the
Bill will probably be that religious instruction should be provided by
the denominations themselves. A report read at a meeting of the
Church of England Assemby shows that an attempt to provide religi-
ous instruction, by the efforts of the clergy and laity, to the children
of members of that denomination attending State schools has absolutely
failed. There are complaints in every part of the country of the want
of religious instruction in the State schools. The State school books
have been expurgated, and nothing of a religious character except
some references to the Deity has been allowed to remain in them.
Deism may be said to be inferentially taught, but nothing else in the
shape of religion. The honourable member for Dundas gave an
account the other night of an object lesson, and said that a child,
receiving a lesson about the pyramids of Egypt, would naturally learn
something of the great Architect of the Universe. If a State school
child asked his teacher who was the great Architect of the Universe,
the teacher might reply ? God,? but if the child asked him who was
. God, he would be restrained by the Education Act from replying to
the question. He could not launch either into the trinitarian or
Unitarian view concerning God, so that in fact he would be stumped
at the very outset ?he could not give religious information. At all
events, according to the ideas which Catholics entertain on the subject,
religious instruction cannot be given under the State school system. No
book put into the hands of a child, except a catechism to teach dogma,
can possibly convey the religious instruction which a Catholic parent
desires for his children. They require that religious instruction shall
permeate the whole teaching of their children. Hence there is a radical
difference between the views of the Catholic body and the views of other
denominations as to the religious instruction of children. The objection
of the Catholics to the State system of education was set set forth in the
numerous petitions presented last year. My Bill is founded the
prayer of those petitions, and it asks for nothing but payment by the State


for secular education according to results. It has been said?? Oh, what
the Catholics want is not education, but a lump sum of money to be
given to the priests to distribute as they think fit.? The answer to that
is that the Bill provides that payment shall be made simply for secular
education judged of and determined by a State inspector, and that, if
necessary, each teacher may go to the Treasury and draw the salary
due to him for imparting that education. Teachers of other schools
availing themselves of the Bill will also receive payment. Hence the
Bill covers more than the Catholics of Victoria. The fourth objection
which will likely be raised to the Bill is that it will make the Catholic
church the one established church of the country ?that is to say, if
the teachers of elementary Catholic or other private schools are paid by
the State, according to results, for teaching reading, writing, arithmetic,
grammar, and geography, the Catholic church will thereby be made
the established church. Was there ever a more ridiculous statement?
If that argument be true, the Bill just passed by the Imperial Parliament
providing for intermediate education in Ireland constitutes the Catholic
church the established church of Ireland, for it contains identically the
same proposition of payment by results for secular instruction. At the
time I prepared my Bill, I was not aware of the existence of that
measure ; and it is, therefore, a somewhat singular coincidence that
Bills should have been introduced in both Parliaments to effect similar
objects. The measure passed by the Imperial Parliament provides
for the payment, to the extent of 1,000,000 pounds as endowments,
out of the proceeds of the funds of the disestablished church,
for secular education, according to results, without regard to any
religious denomination whatever ; and ten children, with one hundred
attendances, are sufficient to constitute a school. It is farcical and
nonsensical to say that measure makes the Catholic church the estab-
lished church of Ireland, or that the passing of my Bill would
constitute that church the established church of this A fifth
objection to the Bill may be that there is no real grievance, as many
Catholics take advantage of the State schools, feeling no injury to
conscience, and that it is only the clergy, and not parents, who are
dissatisfied. I think I have already shown conclusively that this is not
the case. The fact that certain Catholics send their children to the
State schools is traceable to the circumstance that the body has not
had sufficient time, and, it may be, not sufficient money, to
provide schools. Again, when we consider how the population
is composed, the number of mixed marriages that have taken
place, the indifference shown by many to all religious observance,
and the great strain it is upon the resources of a poor labouring man
(earning, it may be, only ss. per day), with a large family, to pay for fhe
schooling of all his children, we can easily understand how it is that
even Catholic children find their way to the State schools. And here
I may say that it is not creditable?on the contrary, it is a disgrace ?to
the Legislature of a country that boasts of its democracy and its
democratic feeling, knowing that these poor labouring men have no
choice between violating their convictions by sending their children to
State schools, and submitting to straitening of their scanty means, to


force upon them the present system of public instruction. It is a
proceeding altogether unworthy of the nineteenth century. And yet
'when these victims of recent legislation ask for a redress of grievances,
a deaf ear is turned to their complaints. They will have, I fear,
good reason to learn the feeling of some members ?
? In all distresses of our friends,
We first consult our private ends.?
And of many others, whose ideas may be summed in the lines :
? Virtue, I grant you, is but an empty boast,
And why should the dignity of vice be lost ??
Another objection which may be raised to the Bill is that there is no
guarantee that teachers in Catholic schools will be equally qualified
-and as efficiently supervised as are the teachers in State schools. An
objection of this kind was raised by the Minister of Public Instruction,
the other night, when discussing the education vote, and I think the
honourable member for Castlemaine (Mr. Pearson) said ?Hear, hear?
to the statement. But when a teacher is put upon his mettle to obtain
a proper amount of salary by producing children that will pass the
standards, it may be of a hostile inspector, the answer to the allega-
tions of want of qualification will be met. A great deal of what has
been said about the qualification of teachers is moonshine as far as
practical teaching is concerned. Even a professor, if sent to teach a
primary school, would in all probability make a great mess of it. As
a rule, I believe it is not the Ist class teacher, but the 2nd
?class teacher, that is the most effective teacher in primary schools.
This is found to be the case in England. A seventh objection may
be that, by not granting the prayer of the Catholic body, Catholic
schools would become extinct. But I have shown already that,
in the face of present disadvantages, there are 164 Catholic
schools in existence, with an average attendance of 15,000 pupils
and I find that the Catholic bishops, clergy, and people are
unanimous in the opinion that those schools are doing good
work. Therefore any hope of extinguishing the system of Catholic
education, whether the State comes to its assistance or not, is
futile. So long as a Catholic has a shilling in his pocket, and is a
Catholic in the real sense of the term, understanding his religion and
observing its laws, it will be impossible for the State, by any act of
coercive legislation, to drive the Catholic body from the performance
of its duties. If the Legislature were to pass as many repressive laws
as the English Parliament passed during three centuries, it would have
to retrace its steps, as the English Parliament has done this year,
and do justice to the persons whom it oppressed. No power on earth
has yet succeeded in overcoming conscience. It is beyond the function
of a Legislature to do such a thing. Any attempt in that direction
cannot be enforced. No matter what combination may exist among
parties, the combination is not as powerful as the voice of conscience.
Therefore, I say, it is just as well for this House to look the question


boldly in the face, and meet it with plain ?Yes? or ?No.? If the-
answer be ? Yes,? a just claim will be acknowledged, and a grievance
be redressed and removed out of the road, and then questions involving"
merely material interests may be fought out on their respective merits,, j
without having the question of Catholic education mixed up wit
them to the disorganization of society as it were, and to the hindrance
of the material prosperity of the country. An eighth objection to the
Bill may be that payment by results alone is not a judicious mode ot
paying teachers. But that objection falls to the ground in the lace ot
the fact that payment by results is already the law of theland, though
it does not fully cover the whole of a State school teacher?s salary, in
England, there has been, for years, an agitation for payment by results
as the most economical thing for the State. But I don?t press that
part of the question, I leave the Education Act of 1872 to its opera-
tion. I have no wish to interfere with it. All that I desire is that
my Bill may be regarded as a supplement to that Act. A further
objection which 1 have heard to the Bill is that we should defer legis-
lation on this subject until all persons are agreed about religious-
teaching, and it was and is one ot the grounds tor excluding religious
teaching in schools ; but I don?t think a more childish objection could be
To suppose that, in this age ot tree thought and of enlightened
democracy, when everybody is clamouring for the must abundant
exercise of individual judgment, tor the right to act as he thinks
proper, agreement on such a subject is at all possible is silly and
absurd. Why, the passing of the Education Act presupposed the im-
possibility of agreement on such a matter. One objection more 1
have to notice, and then I shall have done with the objections to the
Bill. It is that the introduction of the measure is most inopportune.
I have explained to the House that I asked the Ministry, last year, to-
bring in an Amending Act, and they declined up to this time. I have
waited patiently in the hope of seeing a disposition shown to grant the
Catholic body some relief, but no action has been taken, and to my
knowledge this grievance is growing in volume and intensity every
year, disturbing society, and interfering with electioneering campaigns
and arrangements. When will there be an opportune period tor
dealing with the matter; and what member undertakes to propose a
remedy ?
An Honourable Member. ?After the next election.
Sir J. O?SHAN ASSY. ?I consider it very opportune to bring it
forward before the next election, so that we may see, in some degree,
what can be done with regard to this great question. I think I have
now disposed of the whole of the objections which may be urged
against the Bill. The Minister of Public Instruction insinuated, last
week, that I bring forward the measure for the purpose of throwing a
bombshell into the Ministerial ranks?that I have no higher or better
motive. If the Ministry really think that a measure like this is a
bombshell which may explode and kill them, they are in a very
unfortunate position. I dare say many honourable members would
not be sorry if that event were to come to pass. But I disclaim any
such idea. This question far transcends any question of local


politics?any question involving merely the existence of politicians--
or of Ministries. I consider that there is a substantial grievance-
here, which is continuing, and will continue to grow, unless grappled
with as it ought to be grappled with in the opinion of every
man who desires to see the prosperity of the country placed on a solid
foundation. That solid foundation we cannot reach until we put
this grievance out of the way. When it is put out of the
way, we shall be in a better position than we are now to play
the game of Parliamentary cricket, in which I would have no
objection to take a part, without the expectation that I would be
able to ?stump? the Minister of Public Instruction. Let the
Parliament
? Poise the cause in Justice?s equal scales,
Whose beam stands sure, whose rightful cause prevails.
And as Cicero puts it: ?
? Justice consists in doing no injury to men ;
Decency in giving them no offence.?
I have noticed that the Minister of Public Instruction has been appar-
ently appalled at the prospective danger to him which this Bill
seems to present. While defending the education vote the other evening,,
he seemed to think less of his department than he did of me, as if I
were a wicked person contemplating an interruption to his happiness.
The circumstance reminded me very much of an incident in connection
with the Burke and Wills exploring expedition. I had the honour of
furnishing ?ships of the desert? for that expedition, and Burke, in one
of his narratives, states that on his way to the Gulf of Carpentaria he
approached a mountain at the sight of which the heavily-laden
camel seemed to groan in spirit. Burke, out of compliment
to my size, or in recognition of the fact that I had fur-
nished the ?ships of the desert,? named the eminence ?Mount
O?Shanassy.? And it seemed, the other night, as if the Minister of
Public Instruction regarded me as the camel regarded the mountain,
for he certainly groaned in spirit. I now wish to call the attention of
the House to circumstances which show that this feeling on the part
of the Catholic body with regard to public education is not of a local
character, but that it has universal application. The right which
I ask for on behalf of the Catholics of Victoria was asked for years
ago, from the Imperial Parliament, on behalf of the Catholics of'
Ireland. In a work on Intermediate Education in Ireland , published
last year in Dublin, I find the following statement: ?
? lu the spring of 1870 there was printed, by order of the House of Commons,,
on the motion of The O?Conor Don, M. P., a declaration of Catholic laymen respect-
ing university education in Ireland. To this exclusively lay document there are
appended the names of 960 gentlemen of the first position among Catholics,
including noblemen, Members of Parliament, deputy lieutenants, and a large num-
ber of magistrates and professional men. These gentlemen demand such a change-
in the existing unfair arrangements for higher education in Ireland as will
satisfy the just claims of Catholics.


? And, lastly, during the last few months, the following declaration has received
the signatures of many thousands of parliamentary elector?s, and still continues to
receive them :
??We, the undersigned Irish Roman Catholics, clergymen and laymen, being
registered parliamentary electors, deem it our duty to declare, as follows, our
conscientious convictions respecting the momentous question of education in
Ireland :
? ? 1. That education, to be fruitful of good, must be founded on religion ; and
that non-religious education tends to subvert religion and morality in Catholic
youth. Our practical conviction of the truth of these principles is evinced by our
maintaining over 6,000 boys and youths in Catholic schools and colleges, at an
annual cost to ourselves of about a quarter of a million sterling.
? ? That while unwilling to interfere with the rights of our Protestant fellow-
countrymen, we claim for ourselves, as Christian guardians and parents, representing
four and a half millions of Irish Catholics, the right?with which we will admit no
interference?to give to our children an education based upon and interwoven with
the religion which we believe to be true, and conformable to the teachings of the
church of which we are members.
?? 3. That our fathers having transmitted unsullied to us our religion, we are
?determined so to hand it down to those who will come after us ; and as, for this
purpose, Catholic education is necessary, we are determined to use all constitutional
means in resisting, as an encroachment upon our civil and religious liberties, every
attempt to force upon us any system of education, university, intermediate, or
primary, which is not based upon the Catholic religion.
� ? 4. That we protest against the assertion that the just claims of Catholics can
be met by the extension or perpetuation of the mixed system, whether by the erec-
tion of new institutions, by the maintenance of the Queen?s colleges and model
schools, or by changing Trinity College, Dublin, into a mixed college.
? ? 5. That inasmuch as we, Catholics, who entertain these conscientious opinions,
contribute equally with our fellow-subjects to the public taxes, it is but just that
endowments and all other advantages afforded by the State to educational institu-
tions, based upon Protestant or upon non-religious principles, should, in the fullest
sense of equality, be shared with Catholic institutions, which alone are in accordance
with the religious opinions of the great mass of the people of Ireland.
? *6. We, therefore, demand such a change in the system of public education ?
primary, intermediate, and university?in Ireland as will place us on a footing of
perfect equality with our fellow-subjects who entertain no conscientious objections
to existing systems, and remove the civil disabilities which are at present inflicted
upon us for our religious opinions in this matter of education.? ?
I think that petition, and the Bill to which I am about to call attention,
will show conclusively that what the Catholics of this country ask for
has a much broader meaning and basis than is supposed by mere local
politicians. Curiously enough, when Earl Beacousfield, the head of the
Imperial Government, was at Berlin, a tew months ago, signing peace
negotiations with other European statesmen, Lord Cairns was intro-
ducing to the House of Lords a Bill for the promotion of intermediate
education in Ireland. I hold in my hand a copy of that Bill, the sth
?clause of which provides as follows :
? It shall be the duty of the board to promote intermediate secular education in
Ireland in the manner provided by this Act, that is to say :
? 1. By instituting and carrying on a system of public examination of students.?
That is exactly what I propose.
? 2. By providing for the payment of prizes and exhibitions, and the giving of
?certificates to students.?
That is exactly what propose.


I 1 1 1

?3. By providing for the payment to managers of schools complying with the
prescribed conditions of fees dependent on the results of public examinations of'
students,?
That is exactly what I propose.
?4. Generally by applying the funds placed at the disposal of the board for the
purposes of this Act as hereby directed ; provided that no examination shall be held
in any subject of religious instruction, nor any payment made in respect thereof.?
The Imperial Parliament appropriates �1,000,000 out of the national
funds, and declares it gives it for this object and no other: and does
not feel compromised in the smallest degree about the matter. I desire
to call attention to a still more marvellous coincidence. The measure
provides further:?
? Result fees shall be paid to the managers of schools for students, who having
attended their schools from the 15th of October of the year previous to that of the
examination, and having made at least 100 attendances from that date to the last
day of the month preceding the examination, may obtain passes according to the
following scale :
First year
Second year

ig made at least 100 attendances from that date to the lasi
jding the examination, may obtain passes according to the

Curiously enough, the bonus proposed by my Bill to be given to a
master in respect to every scholar who passes the matriculation and
civil service examinations is �lO. That Bill was passed unanimously
by the House of Lords, and I say that nothing could be more graceful,,
nothing could be more gratifying, and nothing could be more in
accordance with the spirit of Earl Beaconsfield?s mission to Berlin,
than these proceedings of his Government in giving to Ireland not
only a great measure of justice, but a great message of peace. To
show how the bill was received in Ireland, I will quote a passage from
the speech of a representative of the Catholic body in the House of
Lords. Lord O?Hagan (late Lord High Chancellor for Ireland) said: ?
? The history of Ireland contains no blacker page than that which describes the
dealings of her rulers with the education of her people, and gives them no
stronger claim to redress and reparation from the Imperial Legislature. Down to
our own times, every successive act of British statesmanship which affected their
mental and moral training was designed and administered in the spirit of an
intolerant sectarianism, aiming at the propagation of religious tenets which they


rejected, and to the adoption of which they could neither he corrupted nor coerced
They were asked to purchase knowledge by the sacrifice of faith.?
The very thing asked here by the Education Act.
? They refused with heroic obstinacy, and they triumphed, after suffering and
-sacrifice such as have rarely defied the cruelty of persecution and vindicated the
liberty of conscience. Not the desolating wars of Elizabeth ; not the ruthless
massacres of Cromwell; not the repeated confiscations which spoiled the old
possessors of the soil, and made them fugitives in bogs and mountains, or home-
less wanderers in foreign lands ; not the commercial jealousy and high-handed
injustice which palsied industry and extinguished manufactures; not these, nor
the many other destructive influences which, for ages, made Ireland miserable,
were so calculated to secure her perpetual degradation as the infamous Statutes
which deliberately attempted to keep in compulsory ignorance four-fifths of her
inhabitants, and so trample out her intellectual life, and with it all hope of her
social redemption. Under that abominable system a Catholic parent could not
instruct his own child ; a Catholic teacher could not bring up a Catholic pupil,
-save under penalties of the most barbarous kind. From all the means of instruc-
tion Catholics were shut out; all Catholic education was absolutely prohibited ;
and it is difficult to conceive how, under such circumstances, the Catholic people
?did not sink into a state of brutal and hopeless debasement. But they did not. In
the darkest days they kept the light of knowledge still glimmering faintly ; their
eagerness for it never slackened. They never ceased to struggle for it; and, in
the struggle, they were always helped by the Catholic priesthood, and by humble
teachers in obscure places who ventured to pursue their noble calling in spite of
the inhuman law.?
In another part of the same speech, referring to the Charter Schools,
Lord O?Hagan observed ?
? Wesley and Howard combined to denounce them ; and the latter, in one of the
most meritorious acts of his noble life, induced the Irish Parliament to inquire into
their condition, describing their pupils as ? sickly, naked, and half-starved,? and the
whole system as a deplorable disgrace to Protestantism. That system then got its
?death-blow; but its hideous existence lingered on to the nineteenth century, and
perished at last, leaving an evil memory to the perpetual execration of mankind.?
The noble lord concluded a brilliant speech by depicting the manner
in which the measure will be regarded in the Emerald Isle. He
remarked ?
? My lords, if the fair promises of this Bill be realized, we shall yet see the Irish
people self-reliant and self-respeciing, redeemed by the power ef an awakened
intelligence. Too many of them have mourned lapsed opportunities and baffled
hope. Generation after generation, too many have passed from childhood to
adolescence, and from youth to age, and gone to the grave without the culture
which would have enabled them to rise to the level of their own capacities, and
improve and exalt their country. A brighter day has dawned. A happier prospect
opens before them. Legislation like this will rouse them from their mental torpor,
and inspire them with courage for the battle of life. The pool of Bethesda was
sluggish, until the angel stirred it, and a healing grace descended on its waters.
The bones were dry and formless, in the vision of the prophet; but the spirit moved
upon them, and they grew to shapes of strength and beauty. And with God?s
blessing, the influence of this measure and of those which may succeed it?with as
sound a principle and as wise an end?will launch Ireland on a great career, and
help her to pursue it with hope and energy.?
Now let us see what William Ewart Gladstone had to say of the same
measure when it came down to the House of Commons. Here is an


-extract from the speech which he made during the debate on the second
reading, on the 17th July last:?
? The principle seems to be in conformity with that for which we have long
?contended, that no man, on account of his religious opinions or preferences is as to
-education, to be placed in a position of disadvantage as respects secular knowledge
?or any of the honours and rewards which may be assigned to secular knowledge by
-the wisdom of Parliament.? J
Further on he said?
?We are about to proclaim to the youth of Ireland seeking intermediate educa-
tion, largely including therein the preparatory stages of education which is
preparatory to the higher, that we will endeavour to give them assistance and
?encouragement in the prosecution of their work, by applying a certain portion of
the national funds now available for the purpose to the recognition of attainments
which they shall achieve in secular education, asking no questions as to the place,
the persons, or the religion in connection with which that secular education was
?obtained. That is a principle perfectly equal as regards all persons and parties in
Ireland.?
These are remarks which apply to this country as well as to Ireland
for though the relative proportion of the several religious denominations*
may be different in Ireland from what it is in Victoria, yet this, like
that, is a mixed community. As to the question of conscience, which
will no doubt be a main feature in this debate, perhaps I may be
pardoned if I quote the authority of no less a person than John
Milton. In his treatise on ? Civil Power in Ecclesiastical Causes,?
John Milton says ?
? It will require no great labour of exposition to unfold what is here meant by
matters of religion ; being as soon apprehended as defined, such things as belong
?chiefly to the knowledge and service of God; and are either above the reach and
light of nature without revelation from above, and therefore liable to be
variously understood by human reason, or such things as are enjoined or
forbidden by divine precept, which else by the light of reason would seem
indifferent to be done or not done; and so likewise must needs appear
to every man as the precept is understood. Whence I here mean by con-
rscience or religion that full pursuasion, whereby we are assured that our belief
and practice as far as we are able to apprehend and probably make appear is
according to the will of God and His Holy Spirit within us, which we ought to
follow much rather than any law of man, as not only His words everywhere bids us
but the very dictate of reason tells us. Acts iv. 19, ?Whether it be right in the
?sight of God, to hearken to you more than to God, judge ye.? That for belief or
practice in religion, according to this conscientious persuasion, no man ought to be
punished or molested by any outward fo; ce on earth whatsoever,?
I now come to a modern authority which probably is respected in this
House. John Stuart Mill, in his Principles of Political Economy,
remarks?
? One thing must be strenuously insisted on?that the Government must claim
no monopoly for its education, either in the lower or the higher branches ; must
?exert neither authority nor influence to induce the people to resort to its teachers
in preference to others, and must confer no peculiar advantages on those who have
been instructed by them. Though the Government teachers will probably be
superior to the average of private instructors, they will not embody all the know-
ledge and sagacity to be found in all instructors taken together, and it is desirable
?to leave open as many roads as possible to the desired end. Nor is it to be endured
?that a Government should, either de jure or de facto, have a complete control over


the education of the whole people. To possess such a control, and actually exert
it is to be a despot. A Government which can mould the opinions and sentiments-
of the people from their youth upwards can do with them whatever it pleases.
Though a Government therefore may, and in many cases ought to, establish schools-
and colleges, it must neither compel nor bribe any person to come to them ; nor
ought the power of individuals to set up rival establishments to depend m an 7
degree upon its authorization. It may be justified in requiring from all the people
that they shall possess instruction in certain things, but not in pi escribing to them
how or from whom they shall obtain it.?
I will now venture to quote a passage from a speech delivered by Lord
Macaulay, when supporting, in the House of Commons, a motion tor
the removal of disabilities. It is as follows .
? Really sir, it is amusing to compare the manner in which the question of
Catholic emancipation was argued formerly by some gentlemen with the manner
in which the question of Jew emancipation is argued by the same gentlemen now..
When the question was about Catholic emancipation, the cry was-_ See how
restless, how versatile, how encroaching, how insinuating, is the spirit of the Church
of Rome. See how her priests compass earth and sea to make one proselyte,
how indefatigably they toil, how attentively they study the weak and strong parts
of'every character, how skilfully they employ literature, arts, sciences, as engines
for the propagation of their faith. You find them in every region and under every
disguise collating manuscripts in the Bodleian, fixing telescopes in the Observatory
of Pekin, teaching the use of the plough and the spinning wheel to the savages of
Paraguay. Will you give power to the members of a church so busy, so aggressive,
so insatiable ? ?
The answer of the English nation was ?Yes.? The following is the
peroration to that speech; ?
? Sir, in supporting the motion of my honourable friend, I am, I firmly believe,
supporting the honour and the interests of the Christian religion I should think
that I insulted that religion if I said that it cannot stand unaided by intolerant laws,
without such laws it wls established, and without such laws it may be maintained.
It triumphed over the superstitions of the most refined and of the most savage
nations, over the graceful mythology of Greece, and the bloody idolatry of the
northern forests. It prevailed over the power and policy of the Roman empire. It
tamed the barbarians by whom that empire was overthrown. But all these
victories were gained not by the help of intolerance, but in spite of the opposition
of intolerance. The whole history of Christianity proves that she has little indeed
to fear from persecution as a foe, but much to fear from persecution as an ally.
May she long continue to bless our country with her benignant influence, strong in
her sublime philosophy, strong in those internal and external evidences to which:
the most powerful and comprehensive of human intellects have yielded assent, the
last ?lac? of those who have outlived every earthly hope, the last restraint of those
who are raised above every earthly fear ! But let us not, mistaking her character
Ind her interests, fight the battle of truth with the weapons of error, and endeavour
to support by oppression that religion which first taught the human race the great
lesson of universal charity,?
At the present day, in continental countries, owing to the rise and
spread of infidelity at the time of the French Revolution, infidel ideas
permeate some of the upper classes of society, and wherever they can
influence legislation, the tendency of the law is just in that direction.
Now let us see what one great teacher says on that subject. I admit
that he belongs to my church, and I make the quotations for the
purpose of showing that sentiments which prevail in Victoria are not
peculiar to this country, but are universal:


? Was it not religious instruction which renewed the world, which sanctified and
softened mutual relations amongst men, which made the moral sense more delicate,
and educated that Christian conscience which represses excesses, reproves acts of
injustice, and raises the people who are faithful above all others ? Will it bi said
that the social conditions of the present age have rendered it useless or noxious ?
But the safety and prosperity of nations have no secure protection apart from truth
and justice, of which society at present so deeply feels the need Like-
wise the nature of the child, and all the special conditions of the times in which we
live, require this. By no compact can the judgment of Solomon on the child be
renewed, and he cannot be divided by an unreasonable and cruel division between
his intelligence and his will. If the cultivation of the first be undertaken, it is
necessary to direct the second to the pursuit of virtuous habits and of its last end.
Whosoever in education neglects the will, concentrating every effort on the culture
of the mind, makes instruction a perilous weapon in the hands of the wicked.
For it is the working of the intelligence which sometimes, strengthening the evil
inclinations of the will, endows them with a force which it is impossible to resist.
. . . And this appears so clear that these very persons who wish religious
instruction excluded from the schools would recognize it, though at a cost of
contradiction ; which persons do not confine their efforts to intelligence alone, but
extend them likewise to the will, causing a system of ethics to be taught in the
schools which they call civil and natural, and directing youth by the acquirement
of social and citizen virtues. But, besides that a morality so formed cannot
guide man to the most high end destined to him by the Divine bounty in the
beatific vision of God. it has not even force sufficient over the mind of the child
to educate him to virtue and to confirm his good intentions ; nor does it answer to
the true and dee}) wants of man, who is a religious being in the way in which he
is a social being, and no progress of science can ever tear out of his soul the most
profound roots of religion and of faith. . . . Nor can it be understood how
the authors of this ill-omened proposal have not been aware of the sinister
impression which must be made upon the mind of the child by seeing religious
teaching placed in conditions so different from all other instruction. . . . Is it
not cruel to allow children to grow up without ideas and sentiments of religion,
until, overtaken by fervid adolescence, they are found in presence of seductive and
violent passions, disarmed, unprovided with any curb, with the certainty of being
drawn down into the slippery paths of crime ? It is a pain to our paternal heart
to see the deplorable consequences of this senseless scheme.?
An Honourable Member. ?Who are you quoting from?
Sir J. O?SHANASSY. ?From Leo Xlll.?the p.resent Pope. And
now I wish to draw attention to a very remarkable circumstance
which has happened within the last few months. The ostensible
ground for the recent war between Russia and Turkey was to protect
the Christian subjects of the Sultan. In a conference which previously
took place, an effort was made to induce the Sultan to behave with
some sort of justice to his Christian subjects, though to expect
anything of the kind was something like expecting an impossibility
seeing that the religion of Mahomet is that of the sword, and that
in the whole of Turkey there is nothing in the shape of a high
educational establishment except a military college where youths
are trained to the pursuit of arms. Well, the war took place, but
it was brought to a close by means of the conference at Berlin. By
the treaty which was then signed, the Sultan voluntarily conceded that
which he could not be induced, by the previous conference, to grant ?
namely, religious liberty to his Christian subjects. Article 35 of the
treaty says ?
?In Servia the distinction of religious creeds and confessions shall not be raised
against any one as a motive of exclusion or of incapacity in everything that


concerns the enjoyment of social and political rights, admission to public employ-
ments, functions, and honours, or the exercise of the various professions and
industries, in any locality whatever. The freedom and the open observance of all
forms of worship shall be assured to all persons of Servian origin, as well as to
foreigners, and no obstacle shall be opposed either to the heirarchical organization
of the different communions, or to their relations with their spiritual superiors.?
The same guarantees are provided for Montenegro, and indeed the
whole Ottoman empire. Article 27 provides?
??ln Montenegro, the distinction of religious beliefs and confessions shall not be
objected to any person as a reason for exclusion or incapacity as regards the enjoy-
ment of civil and political rights, the admission to public employments, functions,
and honours, or the exercise of the various professions and industries, in any locality
whatsoever.
?The freedom and the outward practice of all forms of worship shall be secured
to the natives of Montenegro, as well as to foreigners, and no hindrance shall be
given either to the heirarchical organization of different communions, or to their
relations with their spiritual chiefs.?
Now Earl Beaconsfield, at the very time that his Government was
passing the Act for intermediate education in Ireland, was concluding
the treaty which secured religious liberty to the Christian subjects of
the Sublime Porte; a labour in which he was aided by all the greatest
men of our time, who have thus stamped the grand idea on the
civilization of this age ; and I say that, whatever may have been his
antecedents in politics, it is to Earl Beaconsfield?s credit that when
the peace of Europe was disturbed, and likely to continue to be
disturbed, he should have interposed with such advantage as not only
to bring about a cessation of hostilities, but to secure liberty of
conscience abroad, and this coincident with a successful endeavour to
secure liberty of conscience at home, thus proving that his Government
practised at home what it had enforced abroad. Now, what I ask of this
House is to imitate the example of the Imperial Government and Parlia-
ment ?to consider the case brought under review with the same intelli-
gence and disposition to do justice that animated the Imperial authorities
in the cases I have mentioned. I may be asked whether, if this Bill
passes, there will not be an addition to the burthens of the State ; and
all that I can say in reply is that, if a few thousand pounds per annum
will settle this difficulty, it will be money well spent. However, I
believe that with the adoption of the reforms in the Education depart-
ment suggested in the late debate, the provisions of the Bill may be
carried out without any increase of the national expenditure. I believe
that the little rivalry which the Bill will be the means of establishing
with the State system will do good in many ways. I believe the
measure will help to cement social harmony among all classes. It will
show what can be done under a cheaper system than the State system.
It will prove conclusively whether the system of results will not be
the best syslem ultimately for the country to adopt. At the same time
it will be attended by no harm whatever. On the contrary, it will lay
the basis of future prosperity and security which, as long as the present
injustice continues, we are not likely to have. I appeal most con-
fidently to this House and the whole community to do an act of fair
play and justice, and so remove a sore which is rankling in our social


system. lam sure that Her Majesty the Queen, whose illustrious
name the colony bears, when she comes to know that this is the only
portion of her dominions where an exclusive system of education
prevails?where proscription has been raised by the Legislature against
one class of her subjects, and that class as faithful as any she has?
will receive the information with deep regret. It was one of her
predecessors who exclaimed in the anguish of his soul, after the defeat
of the British arms at Fontenoy, which was brought about, in great
measure, by the bravery of ? the Irish brigade ? ?? Accursed be the laws
that have deprived me of such subjects ! ? I trust Her Majesty will
never have reason to say anything of that kind. On the contrary,
I hope she will have cause to bless her Imperial and Colonial Parlia-
ments for wise legislation by which all the subjects of her extended
?empire are bound together in the bonds of harmony. However, lam
satisfied that, should the time arrive when the British throne and
empire may be endangered, no persons will be found more loyal and
devoted than Her Majesty?s Catholic subjects in all parts of her
dominions. And, in the words of our most renowned author, I may
be permitted to say to this Assembly :
? Be just, and fear not;
Let all the ends thou aim?st at be thy country?s,
Thy God?s, and truth?s.?

PUBLIC INSTRUCTION.
i Qth October , 1877.
The House then went into Committee of Supply.
On the vote of �231,599 to complete the vote (�184,599) for the
?department of Public Instruction,
Sir J. O?SHANASSY said ?Sir, the subject now under consideration
is the vote for the maintenance of elementary schools established in
accordance with the provisions of an Act of Parliament passed in
December, 1872, and amended by an Act passed in 1076. From all I
can learn?and I speak only from statements made to me, because I
was not a member of this House during the period ?no discussion
whatever has taken place since the passing of the Act of 1872 upon the
vote for education. The amount provided for on the Estimates has
been voted, but no discussion has taken place as to the items of the
vote', or on any of the incidents connected with the Education depart-
ment. If lam wrong, I shall be glad to be corrected. I take it that
so large a vote ?embracing, as it does in my judgment, one-third of the
taxes proper paid by the people of this colony ?is a subject sufficiently
large in its character, as far as the mere financial aspect of the case is
concerned, to call upon Parliament at all times to rigidly watch this
expenditure and scrutinize it with great care. Therefore I think no
apology is required from me for calling the attention of the committee
to this matter. I find that, in the Imperial Parliament, when a vote is
brought down for the purposes of education, whether in England and
Wales, in Ireland, or in Scotland, the Minister in charge of the depart-
ment invariably makes a short statement of an administrative character,
showing what has been done in the past with regard to the system of
?elementary education in each country.
Major SMITH. ?The report of the Education department does that
here.
Sir J. O?SHANASSY.?Reports are also printed there, but the
Minister deems it only due to Parliament, when he asks for a vote, to
make a short impartial explanation of the operation of the law in force.
Ido not know whether that has been done in the past here. Certainly
it has not been done in the present. But the importance of the
subject, apart from its financial aspect, is considered so great by the


House of Commons, that it is invariably done there. The last occasion
when it was done was in July, when an address was delivered by
Viscount Sandon, who represents the Education department in the
House of Commons. Although there is no responsible Minister of
Education in England as there is here, there is in the House of
Commons a gentleman prepared to answer for the department, and to
explain what is the operation of the law. It does not follow that
au y gentleman who holds such an office in the House of Commons or
the Government feels himself in the slightest degree compromised by
the principles of the law. It is the invariable practice under the
system of responsible government which prevails in the United
Kingdom, for a Minister or a Government to administer any Act
irrespective of his or their own views as to whether that Act is
right or wrong. They are not called upon, in the administration of
the law, unless they have the power to change it, necessarily to
express an opinion of their own upon the subject. Consequently the
administration of the law, as it appears to me, is totally distinct
from the principles embodied in the law itself. Judging from the
reports in the 1 imes newspaper, it is invariably presented to Parlia-
ment from that point of view, whatever the Government that may be
in office. But here the theory has been laid down that no person
should have the administration of an Act unless he concurs with
the principle of it. I was never more astonished than when I first
heard of this doctrine, and I could not avoid commencing my remarks
on this occasion without pointing out what a great error it is with
regard to constitutional government. We might as well expect the
judges of the land or magistrates, when called upon to punish
persons, or to give a decision in civil cases, to administer the law
according to their own opinions of what the law should be. It is
not necessary for the impartial administration of this or any other law
that the administrator should agree with it. An honourable man will
endeavour to find out what the law is, and endeavour to administer it
accordingly. Certainly it is not necessary that each member of a
Government should ,ne at heart with the principles of the law he
* called upon nister; otherwise the most interminable con-
fusion might arise .u transacting the affairs of the country. To show
that this statement is correct, I will venture to trespass upon the
committee with a few extracts from the speech delivered by Viscount
Sandon, in the House of Commons, on the 10th July last. Speaking
of the state of education in England and Wales, Viscount Sandon
said?
? During the year the number of public elementary schools had been raised to
14,273, or an increase of 1,056, the accommodation afforded being now sufficient for
3,426,000, an increase of 280,000 upon the preceding year. . . . Since last
year 460 new board schools, giving accommodation for 170.000 additional children,
had been established, while in the same period the number of voluntary schools
had been increased by 580, giving 110,000 additional seats. . . . The position,
therefore, was that, since 1870, there had been established 1,600 board schools?
including 600 voluntary schools transferred to the boards?which gave accommoda-
tion to 556,000 children ; that in the same period there had been established 5,000
voluntary public and elementary schools, affording seats for 1,100,000 additional


children. The present state of the case was that rather more than 500,000 seats
had been provided by the boards at a cost of �4,427,000, and a little less than
3,000,000 seats had been provided by voluntary effort on an outlay of about
�13,000,000, supplemented by the Government grant amounting to �1,750,000, so
that the total capital expended by the country on education was something like
�l9 000 000. There could be no need therefore, he thought, for the country to
blush as to the amount of work it had done in reference to the great work of
education.?
Further on, Viscount Sandon said ?
?With regard to the number of teachers, there had been an increase during
the year of 2,100 certificated teachers, 460 assistant teachers, 2,600 pupil teachers,
and 82 in training colleges. As far as the attendances of children were concerned,
there had been an increase of 200,000 on the books and 150,000 in average
attendance. . . . With regard to the work done by the children, he could
have wished that more had been presented for examination in the higher
standards ; but he thought the fact as it stood was accounted for by the circum-
stance that the system was comparatively new, and had not as yet become
thoroughly organized. He was confirmed in this view by the case of Scotland, a
country which had had a much longer experience of compulsory elementary educa-
tion than England. While in England 87 per cent, of the children submitted for
examination passed in reading, the percentage was 94 in Scotland. As far
as writing was concerned, the percentage was 79 in England and 88 in Scotland,
the proportions in reference to arithmetic being 70 per cent, in England and 81 in
Scotland. ... As far as the cost of the education of the children was con-
cerned, he found, by comparison between England and Scotland, that the expendi-
ture per child in all schools, board and voluntary, was �1 IBs. 4�d. per head per
annum in England, and �1 16s. lid. in Scotland. The rate for education in
England amounted to 3s. 9Jd. ; in Scotland to 10s. 2d. The Imperial grant in
England was lls. Bd. ;in Scotland it was 11s. lOd. It was worthy of notice that
where the voluntary contributions went down there the rates went very largely up.
He rejoiced to observe the very satisfactory rivalry which existed in many
quarters between the voluntary and the board schools. Everything seemed to
point to this, that people were giving themselves to the great w r ork of seeing that
the'children of the country had good schools, and that in those schools they were
well taught, and had all the benefits and advantages which Parliament intended
to secure for them.?
It will thus be seen that Viscount Sandon does not enter, as a partisan,
into the spirit or nature of the Imperial Education Act of 1870, or the
Amending Act of 1876, but he gives to the House of Commons a fair
view of the operation of the law. So much for the way in which the
duty of a Minister is regarded in the House of Commons with respect
to a question of this kind. And now I desire to point out what is the
Jaw which Viscount Sandon has to administer. This is what is provided
with regard to the parent :
? The parent, not being a pauper, of any child who is unable by reason of
poverty to pay the ordinary fee for such child at a public elementary school, or any
part of such fee, may apply to the guardians having jurisdiction in the parish in
which he resides, and it shall be the duty of such guardians, if satisfied of such
inability, to pay the said fee.?
The parent is thus held by the State to have a duty to perform to his
child ; and, in the event of the parent being in such poverty that he
cannot pay the school fees,the guardians of the poor are to provide the
means for the education of his child. This is the law both in Scotland


and England. So far there is a grand distinction between tbe obliga-
tion which the Imperial Legislature imposes upon the parent and that
which the law of this country does. Then, again, if the compulsory
provision of the law has to be enforced, it is done not by the Govern-
ment but by the local school board or the school attendance committee.
Either of those bodies can take steps to bring the case before magis-
trates, and obtain an order, and by that order the child is directed to
be sent to a particular school, but the parent has the power of
determining what school it shall be. It is not in the power of the
magistrates there, as it is here, to send the child to any school they
like, but the parent has the power to determine what school it shall
go to. Again, in Great Britain no child can be sent under compulsion
to a school in the management of which the conscience clause is not
observed, and if the religious rights of the child in any such school are
interfered with, the punishment by the Government is the withdrawal
of the grant-in-aid from that school. Still further, if a parent is in
poverty it he can prove that he is unable to sustain his child if its
labour is dispensed with by it being sent to school?that parent is
entitled to relief from the guardians of the poor. It is the duty of the
guardians to pay the school fee of any child whose parent is unable to
pay it by reason of poverty. Provision is also made for sending
children to certain schools at which meals are given, and for these the
parents must pay if they are able, but if not the meals are provided,
gratuitously. It will be seen, therefore, that the law in England
clearly and carefully distinguishes between the duties of the State and
the position and rights of the parents. Every protection is thrown
around the parental authority, the State seeing, as far as possible, that
elementary instruction is given without infringing in the smallest
degree on the conscientious scruples of the parents. This being so,
I would not be performing the duty I have undertaken if I did not
point out the vast distinction which exists between the education law
in operation in England and that in force in this colony. Here, under
the measure passed last session to amend the Education Act of 1872, a
parent who neglects to sends his children to school is brought before
the magistrates by a truant officer, or at the instance of the local board
of advice, and he is fined. No one steps in to provide the fine if he
is unable to pay it, and he may go to gaol. A parent may have a great
objection, for conscientious reasons, to send his children to a State
school, but there is no protection whatever for him on that score.
There are some other matters of an administrative character in the
English system which show how, under that system, everything that
huma,n ingenuity can devise has been provided in order to respect
conscientious scruples while promoting the interests of education. With
regard to the standard of education, our Act merely provides that the
inspectors, without any check whatever, can grant certificates to
children as having passed the standard in reading, writing, and
arithmetic; but in England no such uncontrolled power is given.
There, by the latest Act, every guarantee is taken that the certificate
shall be a bond fide one, showing not merely that a child has passed
the examination to the satisfaction of an inspector, but that he has


.attended a certain number of times at school. A child cannot, in fact,
obtain a certificate in England unless he has both attended school a
?certain number of times and attained a certain standard of proficiency
in reading, writing and arithmetic. In connection with this matter, I
may call attention to a novelty in the Victorian Education Act,
namely, the provision with regard to teaching what are called ? extra
subjects.? So far as the operation of this principle is concerned, I
think the most ardent admirers of the Act must come to the conclusion
that it has been an absolute failure. The Imperial law provides a very
different kind of thing. Provision is there made by which grants are
given to children who have attained efficiency in extra subjects. In
fact, in England there is a bonus given to encourage children to advance
.above the ordinary standard of education; but here a hindrance is
placed in their way by the imposition of a fee for extra subjects.
This is a most material difference ?a distinction of very great im-
portance. I find that in Victoria, during the past year, out of 1,500
schools, the fees paid for extra subjects amount to upwards of �4,000.
The total number of children on the school rolls is stated to be
.231,000, with an average attendance of 106,000. On classifying the
schools in accordance with the return moved for by the honourable
member for Collingwood (Mr. Mirams), I find that there are 500
schools with an average attendance of only 21 children, costing the
State �60,000 apart from buildings ; or, adding the proper proportion
of the departmental expenses, about �7 for each child. It must be
remembered that, though the average attendance at those schools is
-stated to be only 21, no guarantee is given as to the number of days
those 21 children are at school. It is most remarkable that out of these
500 schools, only six pay anything at all in regard to extra subjects, and
those contribute the magnificent sum of �3O. In the face of these
facts, I think no one will say that the section of the Act providing for
the payment of fees for instruction in extra subjects has been any-
thing but an absolute failure, judged by its results. I may here
mention that the return from which I have obtained these figures a
??return showing the State schools in operation with an average
attendance of 30 and under, together with full particulars of their
cost? ?is printed in such small type that it almost requires the aid of
a microscope to read it, especially by persons who, like myself, are
somewhat advanced in years. There is no reason why honourable
members should be subjected to the annoyance of having such returns
printed in the smallest possible type. I think that I have now made
clear to the committee the leading distinctions between the education
law in operation in England, Wales, and Scotland, and that which
exists in this colony. The difference in the expenditure is also a very
material matter to be considered. For England and Wales, with a
population of 22,712,000, according to the last census, the total vote
for education this year was �1,910,629; lor Scotland, with a popula-
tion of 3,360,000, the amount was �488,782; and for Ireland, with a
population of 5,411,416, it was �645,000; or a total of �3,034,000
for a population of about 34,000,000 ; and this, it must be remembered,
is a great increase on the expenditure of former years. lam speaking


simply of elementary education. Of course, these amounts only
represent the money paid by the State, for, in Great Britain, education
is supported by private subscriptions and fees, as well as by grants
from the State; while we, in this country, undertake to educate every
child free that is, at the expense ot the State. The average cost of
education in the United Kingdom, as far as the State is concerned, is
not quite 2s. per head of the population. Now, what does education
cost the State in this country ? I find that for the year ending the
30th June, 1873, the total expenditure, including buildings and every-
thing the State then provided in the shape of education, was �226,463.
The present Education Act was passed in December, 1872, but no,
large vote was taken to bring it into operation until the commence-
ment of the financial year 1873?4, and in that year the vote jumped
up from �226,463 to �502,616, being an increase of nearly �300,000
for the first year the Act was in operation.
Major SMITH. There was a jump of 30,000 scholars the same
year.
Sir J. O?SHANASSY.?If there was a jump of 30,000 scholars the
same year, it does not appear that those' scholars were not at school
before. They were taken out of private and other schools. I think I
will be able to show later on that the increase was not the result of
this extra expenditure of money. There is one thing I may mention
here. I would like to know whether the Treasurer?s cash balance was
seized upon in the year 1873-4 to provide the increase in the vote
represented by the difference between �226,463 in 1872-3 and �502,616
in 1873-4 ? lam informed that such was the case, but I cannot trace
it, as I have not been in office since. I mention the matter now
publicly, in order that I may be corrected if I am wrong.
Mr. SERVICE. That could not be done as long as the money was
all on the Estimates.
Bir J. O?SHANASSY.?The impression on my mind was, that it had
been done, and therefore I thought it best to mention the subject
publicly. In the year 1874-5, the education vote was �559,338; in
1875-6, it was �536,292 ; in 1876-7, �449,740 ; and for the present
} ear, 1877?8, it is �484,599. I would like to ask whether this amount
will be the whole vote for 1877-8 ?
Major SMITH.?No.
Sir J. 0 SHANASSY.-?Then it is only fair that the committee
should be informed how much will be put on the Supplementary
Estimates. 1 estimate that the additional amount will be about
�40,000, and I hope the Minister of Public Instruction will correct
me if that is in excess of, or less than, the actual sum which will
be required. It will thus be seen that, during the last five years,
we have spent for the purposes of elementary education the very
respectable sum of �2,532,585, or an average of about �500,000 per
annum.
Mr. RAMSAY.?That includes buildings.
Sir J. O?SHANASSY,?But it does not include the loan. This is
the total amount in the Appropriation Acts for those years for educa-
tional purposes. I have had a return furnished to me showing that,.


from 1872 to 1878, the educational expenditure will have included
�2,454,299 for salaries; pensions, �G,703; rents and buildings,.
�497,936 ; and from the loan, �268,220 ; making nearly �BOO,OOO for
rents and buildings. It therefore appears that, in these few years,
there will have been expended on education about �3,200,000; and
this does not take into account the amount which will have to be placed
on the Supplementary Estimates for the present year. This is the
state of our expenditure in relation to education under the existing
Act. Now, I ask whether there is any comparison between this,,
considering our means and population, and what I have pointed out is
the expenditure in England, where there is no great comparative
difference in point of wealth ? When I w r as in England, ten years ago r
the population there, as a general rule, appeared to be remarkably w r ell
off. It may be that, in particular seasons, they are not very well to do;;
but, on the whole, they are tolerably comfortable. There is a vast dispro-
portion between the cost to the State of elementary education in the
United Kingdom and in this country. An effort has been made by the
State to supply children in Victoria with elementary education at a
cost which, I venture to think, few people have contemplated up to the
present time. In the debate in the House of Commons to which I
have already referred, Mr. Chamberlain, one of the members for
Birmingham, made the following statement: ?
? In our colony of Victoria, the average attendance of children at school increased
from 135,000 to 200,000 in two years after the abolition of fees.?
Where the honourable member got his information from to make such
a statement I am at a loss to conceive ; but, as we read the debates
of the House of Commons, I trust that he will do us the courtesy to read
the report of this debate, and see if his statement is borne out by facts.
The question arises?What have we got in exchange for the large
expenditure which we have incurred on education ? . There can be no
doubt that the expenditure is large in proportion to our resources. If
it goes on increasing year by year, where is the thing to end at all ?
School buildings form a heavy item of the expense. These State schools
are multiplied in every quarter, I do not know from what motive
whether it be from ? proper representations? or other influences?but
I know, as a matter of fact, that in many instances schools have been
built where they were not required at all. Besides new schools being
built, various denominations have rented their schools to the Education
department at nominal rates. I find, from a return presented this
evening, that in some cases the rent is as low as 2d., 6d., Bd., 10d.,
ild., and Is. per year. 1 cannot conceive why the rental is so small,,
unless the denominations hope for a change in the law by which they
will get back their schools.
Mr. SERVICE.?Is it not 2d. per head, instead of 2d. per year ?
Sir J. O?SHAN ASSY. ?No. Any honourable member can examine
the return for himself, and he will see that there is at least one case
where the rental charged is 2d. per annum, and there are several
instances where it is as low as 6d. and Is. We must, therefore, tak&


into account not merely the schools which the Government have
?erected and paid for, but also the fact that other buildings are being
rented at nominal sums; so that, in order to push out the State
system of education, we are taking advantage of the past. The
report of the Education department for the year 1876-7 says :
? The following statement shows the work which has been done towards the
supply of the requirements of the colony in the matter of school buildings since
the passing of the Act;?
?Number of new schools erected since the passing of the Act, 579
.�381,082 10s. 4d. ?
?Number of schools enlarged ditto, 76?�29,343 18s. lid.
? Number of schools reconstructed and repaired ditto, 65?�12,215 15s.
? Number of new schools now in course of erection, 133?�111.398 12s. 3d.
? Number of enlargements of existing schools ditto, 14?�6,950 15s. 7d.
? Number of reconstructions of existing schools now proceeding, 11?
�1,241 Bs. 5d.?
So that, practically, 878 schools have been built since the passing of
the Act, and are now used in carrying out the State system of educa-
tion, in addition to those rented by the department. At the time the
Act came into operation the number of schools in existence under the
common and denominational systems was upwards of 1,100, and,
therefore, making allowance for those which have since been closed,
the total number of State schools now is about 1,500; so that no
exertion has been spared by Parliament to push out the existing
system, and make it, if possible, a great success. In fact, a hot-bed
or forcing process has been adopted, by the power of money, in order
to endeavour to make the present educational system the success which
Parliament anticipated it would be when it passed the Act of 1872.
In saying this, I think that lam fairly stating the case. It must be
remembered that, in order to attain the results which have been
achieved, the expenditure has jumped from �200,000 a year to an
average of �500,000 or �600,000. What is the corresponding gain in
point of attendance ? Two months ago I asked for a return in order
Parliament and the country might know what advantage it is
getting for the very large expenditure which the present educational
system entails Amongst other information I desired was ?the number
of daily attendances of each child for the year 1876-7.? This is a
very important matter, in order to enable us to ascertain whether we
are getting value for our money; but I am informed now, after the
lapse of two months, that the information cannot be supplied.
Major SMITH.?It would cost �2,000 to supply the information
asked for by the honourable member.
Sir J. O?SHANASST.?If the school rolls had been kept in the
same way as under the old Board of Education, the return could
been prepared at little or no cost. A return, however, has been
furnished by the department this afternoon, showing ? by approxima-
tion ? some of the particulars lam anxious to ascertain. It appears
that the number of children enrolled in State schools during the year 1876
was 171,583. The return, I may state, has been compiled from informa-
tion obtained from 85 schools, though there are 1,500 in existence.


The names of the 85 schools are not given, but I take it for granted*
that they have been selected impartially by the officers of the
department, and not with the view to show the most favourable results.
It appears that the number ot children who did not attend in
accordance with the Education Act was as follows : Quarter ending
September 30, 1876, 13,527; quarter ending December 31, 1876,
18,480; quarter ending March 31, 1877,21,738; quarter ending June-
-30, 1877, 20,628. With regard to the ? number of daily attendances
for each child for the year 1876-7,? the return simply says?'?this-
information cannot be given.? The reports for 1870 and 18/1, when,
the educational system was under the control of a body called the
Board of Education, bring out the fact that the daily attendance of
each child on the school rolls at that period was about 123 days. Had
the rolls been kept up under the new system of education in the same-
manner that they used to be under the former system, the information,
which the Education department says cannot be given could have been
furnished without any trouble. The children are stated, in the docu-
ment which has been supplied by the department, to have attended
school as fellows during the past year : ?lor 60 days, 20,123 children;
for 90 days, 20,493 ; for 120 days, 62,455 ; for 200 days and upwards,
18,508 In considering the average attendances, we must bear in
mind that the climate of this country is very different from that of
Great Britain and America, and much more favourable for children to
attend school a greater number of days in a year than in either of those
countries. Well, after the great flourish of trumpets there has been
as to the success of the Education Act in bringing the children into
the schools, the result is set forth in the figures I have just quoted.
Will any one be bold enough to assert that this result is anything like
commensurate with the amount of money expended on our present/'
educational system compared with the cost of the system which it has*
superseded ? In 1872, the total number of children on the school rolls
was 135,962, the average attendance being 68,436'; and, as I have
already stated, the reports of the Board of Education for 1870 and
1871 show that each child attended 123 days in the year, or there-
abouts. It is very remarkable that the reports of the Education
department contain no information on this most important and
material fact, namely, the number of days which each child attends
school under the present system, and that the department, when
challenged to bring forward the information, says that it cannot be
supplied. I cannot understand why it has not been supplied, especially
as it was always furnished by the Board of Education, and the officers
of the department are the same officers who were employed by the
board. The truth of the matter, I suppose, is that if the information
were given it would make the present educational system compare
most unfavourably with the system it has superseded. It is, however,
the duty of the Minister of Public Instruction to give the fullest
information to Parliament as to the operation of the Act, and not to
suppress an important item which was invariably clearly and
distinctly set forth in the reports issued by the Board of Education.
So far as the information contained in the return which has been


furnished this afternoon goes, it is most damaging against the existing
system. The report of the department for 1876-7 says ?
?The total number enrolled in capitation schools has been reduced from 18,680
in 1875 to 12,913 in 1876, and the number in average attendance in these schools
from 8,146 to 5,788, Though many of the scholars are transferred to State schools
when aid is withdrawn from capitation schools, the latter are often continued as
private schools, so that the closing of the capitation schools has an effect constantly
m|operation to decrease the numbers in attendance at State-aided schools, and to
reduce the increase in attendance.?
The writer of this must he a humorist. If he had said that he found
a certain number of capitation schools in existence, and went and
blocked them up as much as he possibly could, by building new schools,
by renting some of those in existence, and thus reducing the
attendance at others, he would have stated the simple fact; but he
says that the closing of the capitation schools has had the effect of
decreasing the attendance at State schools, whereas the contrary is the
fact. The writer ought to have stated that the department is not able
to draw from the capitation schools the number of children expected,
so as to fill the new State schools. Under the old system about 68*
per cent, of the children did attend school; but under the new system
the attendance has been going down year by year, and there is no way
of accounting for the decrease except by the fact that compulsion is a
failure, and that the free system of education does not attract all the
children. The average attendance in 1874 was 104,375; in 1875 it
went down to 101,495 ; and in 1876 it was 106,758 out of a total roll
of 231,560. Look at the number of children who are now within the
school age who had not attained to that age six years ago. Why does
not the average attendance advance in proportion as the number of
children of school ages increases ? That is not explained in the report
of the department or in any Ministerial statement. Scarlatina, fever,
and such causes are assigned for the attendance not being
larger ; but, if the reports of the Board of Education are looked
through, it will be found that during the time the old system
was in operation scarcely a year passed without typhoid fever or
some other epidemic prevailing, and affecting the attendance
of children at school. Therefore sickness cannot be said to account
for the smallness of the present attendance at the State schools. The
promoters of the Act, when the measure was before the Assembly,
stated that the new system was not to be more expensive than the one
it was to supersede. Mr. Stephen, who was called the father of the
Act, said so, and so also did Mr. Langton, who supported it strongly ;
while the present Chief Secretary, who was opposed to it, said the
probabilities were that the expenditure would not increase beyond
�25,000 a year. They were out in their calculations, apart from the
cost of buildings, something more than �200,000 per annum. It was
anticipated that economy would be effected by the amalgamation of a
number of small schools ; but what has happened ? About 500 new
schools have been added at a vast cost, and have produced a marvellously
small result. On looking over the return showing the State schools
with an average attendance of 30 children and under, I see that there


are 40 schools with an average attendance of only 12, each child costing
the State �7 or �S per annum; and probably not more than half the
-children belonging to those schools attend 120 days in the jear. The
inspectors call attention to the fact that in some parts of the country
the State, in order to have a small school, incurs an expense which
amounts to giving a bonus of as much as �SO to each family living in
the locality. Instead of the expense of education being kept down, it
has been multiplied to a degree that the authors of the Act never
contemplated. I have already referred to the system under which
extra subjects are taught, and shown that it cannot succeed. The
Act must be amended in that respect. It was contended by the
promoters of the Act that under it the quality of the instruction given
in the schools would be improved ; but any impartial person reading
the reports of the inspectors will come to the conclusion that the
-quality of the instruction is inferior to that imparted under the Board
?of Education. Reading is made a mechanical thing, arithmetic a
mechanical thing, and grammar and geography a sort of cram, the
children being taught so that the masters may get certain results, but
knowing nothing of the subjects when questioned about them afterwards.
Mr. RAMSAY.?That is not the case.
Sir J. O?SHANASSY.?I refer the honourable member to the
reports of the inspectors. Mr. Gilchrist, the inspector for one of the
metropolitan districts, in his report dated the 14th of April, 1877, says?
? Taken as a whole, the district is not in a highly satisfactory, but only in an
average state of efficiency. It has such a mixture of good, moderate, and
indifferent schools that it is, I believe, a fair specimen of the colony generally. I
know that some districts are in a more efficient state than this is, and I believe
some are in a less efficient condition.?
I have carefully conned over the reports of the inspectors, and let my
statement that the quality of the education is worse under the present
than it was under the old system be controverted, if it can be, by a
comparison of the reports of the inspectors for this year with their
reports when the Board of Education was in existence. As regards
the attendance, this is what one of the inspectors says?
? For every 100 scholars on the rolls for the past year the average attendance
was 54, the number of pupils who had attended at least 120 days (the minimum
prescribed by law) was only 59, and the average number of days attended by each
pupil was no more than 131, or about 57 per cent, of the whole number of actual
?school days.?
The reports of the inspectors point to the fact that there is an anxiety
on the part of the teachers so to work the schools as to get the
largest possible amount of money out of them. One states that this
is done by keeping the junior classes without their proper share of
instruction, and concentrating attention chiefly on the senior classes.
I do not know when the report of the Education department for 1876-7
was written, because it is not dated. It was presented to Parliament
in July last. If it had been dated ?and I do not see why it should
not have been ?we would have been able to determine how far the
present Minister of Public Instruction is responsible for it. The


report bears the honourable gentleman?s signature, but, as he only
took office about the end of May, I would like to know whether he
simply had time to put his signature to it before it was printed, or
whether he compared it with the statements of the inspectors before
signing it ? The report says ?
i< Xn appendix E. will be found the general reports of the inspectors containing
their opinions on the state of education in their several districts. The results of
the examinations held by them during the year show that good progress continues'
to be made, the average per centages of results for 1876 being 74-645 as against
70?04 for the year 1875.?
Kow this is not sustained by any extracts from the inspectors? reports..
Under the former system, when the Board of Education wished to
sustain any statements it made, it quoted the portions of the inspectors?
reports on which they were based. Ragged schools were to be
rendered unnecessary under the new system, because all neglected
children were to brought into the State schools ; but has that been
done ? Bv the comparative smallness of the attendance at the
schools, it is quite clear that it has not. Erom -what we observe in
Melbourne, and in other places, we see that the neglected children are
neglected still. One of the inspectors states that a voluntary associa-
tion has been formed at Geelong to provide for the educational wants
of these children in that district. Again, it was said that the
religious difficulty would be got over by the free and compulsory
system of education ?that children of all religious denominations
would be forced into the State schools. If there is any respect in
which the system has failed, it is in not having overcome the religious
difficulty. Human nature is so constituted that you cannot get over
that difficulty by what is called a purely secular system of education.
It has been proved that the Roman Catholic body, who constitute a
very large portion of the population, cannot by any possibility be
induced to accept this system. Then the school teachers were to have
been satisfied by the new system, and their condition much improved.
What do the teachers themselves say in their own newspaper ? They
state that faith was deliberately broken with them by the Government
who introduced the measure. It was promised that they would
be made members of the civil service, be classified, and have retiring
allowances, and so forth. Has that been done?
Mr. SERVICE. ?The teachers have practically been made members
of the civil service.
Sir J. O?SHANASSY. ?They have not been brought under the
Civil Service Act. They are placed under certain departmental
regulations; but there is no guarantee that, if a change of Government
took place, or a change of public opinion, they would get any of the
privileges ?which were promised to them. The teachers complain
loudly that faith has not been kept with them in this matter. Then,,
with regard to night schools, it is confessed in the report that night
schools have failed. The report states that it is unreasonable to
expect persons who are at work all day to attend school at night; and
it is pointed out by the inspectors that the only way in which to secure


an attendance of scholars is to encourage it by a fee, and that is so
much opposed to the fundamental principles of the Act that they will
not recommend it. It is also pointed out, and I notice the fact with
regret, that on the ground of morals night schools cannot be a
success. And so night schools go to the wall. With regard to the
infant children attending school, according to the inspectors? reports,
their numbers go to swell the school rolls, but, in reality, no such
thing as infant education exists. And now I come to the position
which was assumed at the time of the passing of the Education Act,
that to supersede the Board of Education by a responsible Minister
would be a great improvement. I don?t think I can be accused of
having any personal feeling with reference to this matter. Not one of
the four or five gentlemen who have filled the position of Minister of
Public Instruction can say that I have any personal feeling towards
him. But I am speaking of the system ; and I ask what has the
change in our educational system led to ? I assert that it has made
the whole department of education substantially a political institution.
Instead of the education of the country being controlled by a board
that had the confidence of the public ?a board representative in its
character ?it is controlled now by a Minister, who changes with every
Government, and who is able, at the opening of every State school,
to deliver a lecture on political subjects, and who identifies himself,
substantially and politically, with the party in power for the time
being. I want to know whether that is a great success ? The
Minister is clothed with authority to appoint masters and mistresses
throughout the country, to dismiss them, to remove them from one
school to another, and this power can be exercised just as the party
supporting him may desire. Practically, instead of being a responsible
Minister, he is an irresponsible Minister. There are no means of
fixing responsibility upon him for his acts unless there happens to be
a majority in Parliament that will haul him over the coals. Conse-
quently, what was thought the great gain of having a responsible
Minister in charge of the Education department is to my mind no
gain at all. Then, again, the present Minister of Public Instruction
is also Minister of Mines, and, finding the -work too onerous for him,
he has been compelled to call in the assistance of another irrespon-
sible Minister. Further, he has been compelled to appoint members
out of this House as a board to investigate charges against teachers,
both male and female, and I understand these gentlemen have to sit
with closed doors ; they cannot carry on their investigation in public.
This is what the possession of a responsible Minister has done for us.
I ask whether that is a proper system to continue ? I am not able to
say how much of the time of the Minister is taken up with the
performance of the duties appertaining to the head of the Mining
department; but I should say that the honourable gentleman must
have abundance to occupy his attention, between ten o?clock in the
morning and four in the afternoon, at the Education department alone,
seeing that no less than 3,500 teachers are his subordinates, and that
he has control over 1,500 schools spread through the length and
breadth of the land. The administrative work connected with a


department of such magnitude must leave the Minister no idle time if
he does his work properly. Not only has the honourable gentleman
to transact the business of the Mines and the Education departments,
but he has to attend meetings of the Cabinet; he has also to attend
the sittings of this House, which occupy as a rule until eleven or twelve
o?clock at night; and further, he has to make grand tours, by special
trains, to open State schools. These are some of the functions the
honourable gentleman has to perform, and it is quite clear that he
cannot perform them without calling in the assistance which he has
called in. While on this point, I may remind the Minister that when,
on a recent occasion,! raised the question of school attendance, he told
me he would consult Professor Pearson, and if he found my statements
w r ere correct, a report on the subject should be furnished ; but this
has not been done.
Major SMITH.?The information was contained in Professor
Pearson?s report which appeared in the public prints some months
ago.
Sir J. O?SHANASSY.?I don?t think it touches the point as to
how many of the children enrolled attend school during the year. In
addition to what I have stated, that this office is necessarily a political
one, I don?t think I am travelling at all out of the way when I say
that, before the last general election, constant appeals were made by
the then Minister of Public Instruction and the then head of the
Government, to the people of the country with reference to State
education. The subject was introduced in every possible way at the
general election. Therefore, I think I have proved my case, that this
department of Education, if not intended to be so originally, has
become practically a political institution. Now, at this stage of the
discussion I may fairly ask the Minister of Public Instruction and the
?Government whether they do not see, without waiting for Professor
Pearson?s final report, that amendments are required both in the
Education Act itself and in the administration of it ? I consider it
only a reasonable request, seeing that five years have elapsed since the
passing of the Act, that the House should be favoured?if not this
session, at all events next session?with the views of the Government
as to the direction in which they propose to amend the measure. I
am aware that the Minister of Public Instruction has made several
speeches as to the direction in which amendments should go; but it
appears to me that he has overlooked that what the Education Act
deals with is primary education; and that a jump from free instruction
in the elements of education?reading, writing, and arithmetic?to
free education at the University is a flight of such magnitude that I
doubt, indeed, whether any such proposal will ever become law. If
honourable members will take the trouble to look at Germany, or any
?country which has perfected a system of public education, they will
find that, to secure anything like one harmonious whole, it is necessary
to begin at the lowest school, and build up the system by degrees
until the top is reached. But this jumping from one extreme to
another is something which has not been attempted in any country of
the w'orld, and I hope that such a new T -fangled notion will not be


countenanced, and particularly as the amendments of the law and
administration which are required are amendments in another direction
alt gether. A sketch of the Prussian system of education is contained
in the following paragraph, which I find in the Statesman's Year Book
for 1877 :
? The Prussian schools are divided into 11 classes ?namely, first, elementary,
embracing village or town schools ; second, ? biirgerchulen,? or citizen schools;
third, real schools, or schools in which languages, arts, and sciences are taught;
fourth, seminaries, or schools for training elementary schoolmasters ; fifth, colleges;
sixth, industrial schools ; seventh, schools of architecture ; eighth, schools of mines ;
ninth, schools of agriculture; tenth, veterinary schools; and, eleventh, the
universities.?
I think the Minister of Public Instruction must see that the country
which has obtained credit in all parts of the world for reaching the
highest standard in the matter of public education, could not have
secured that result by the adoption of the plan foreshadowed by the
honourable member, of stepping at once from the primary school to
the university. And here I desire to point out one gross injustice
?Connected with the administration of the present Act, the injustice of
confining the prizes given for the University to children taught in State
schools. I want to know what for? What reason is there, when
public money is appropriated for prizes, why children educated at the
cost of their parents at primary schools should not have the opportunity
of competing for the prizes -with the children who attend State schools ?
Having dealt with the questions of school attendance, expenditure, and
the amount of instruction given, I will now proceed to call attention to
the petitions which have been presented to this House during the
present session. I find that the Roman Catholic community have
presented no less than 53 petitions complaining of the operation of
the Education Act. These petitions have come from Geelong, Mans-
field, Daylesford, Gisborne, Riddell?s Creek, Sunbury, Duneed, North
I'itzroy, Melbourne, Mount Prospect, Collingwood, Ballan, Gordons,
Bacchus Marsh, St. Kilda, Keilor, Essendon, Broadmeadows, Hotham,
Ballarat, Smythesdale, Ararat, Stawell, Carlton, Cluues, Talbot, Sand-
hurst, Barkstead, Chetwynd, Coleraine, Colac, Kilmore, Tylden, Malms-
bury, Taradale, Woodend, Kyneton, Redesdale, Anakie, Darraw it,
Elaine, Lethbridge, Meredith, Steiglitz, St. Arnaud, Horsham, Terang,
Creswick, Warrnambool, Brighton, Heidelberg, Tarraville, Castbmaine,
Emerald Hill, Echuca, Chiltern, Belfast, Wangaratta, and Richmond.
In fact, petitions have come from every important centre in the colony,
and they bear the signatures of 18,626 persons. Two of those petitions
have been printed ; and I think it will be a piece of great hardihood
to say that they are not representative petitions. I say that the
petitions which have been presented to this House represent the
opinions and the feelings not only of those who have signed them, but
of those who have not signed them, and who number, as I am informed,
and as I believe, nearly one-fourth of the population of the country.
The first petition I will refer to is one which I presented from the
Archbishop of Melbourne and 700 other persons. The petitioners
say?


? We respectfully renew, for the consideration ot your honourable House, the
prayer of the petition presented to the late Parliament in reference to our conscien-
tious objections to the State school system of education. In that petition is briefly
stated what we want, and what would meet our objections to the exclusively secular
system by law established.?
They point out that, in the archdiocese of Melbourne alone, there are
112 unaided Roman Catholic schools, with an average daily attendance
of 9,732 children, which, according to the Government standard, means
a maximum attendance of 20,000 : and they state further?
?That, as in 1872, when the Education Act was under discussion, we urged the
adoption of a system fair to all educational interests, being that known as ? payment
by results? and ? capitation ; ? so now we do not ask for the expenditure of any public
money upon religious training, nor for a separate grant to be expended under our
own control, but that our schools be officially inspected like the State schools, and
payment made upon the claim and certificate usually adopted by the Education
department.?
This is a distinct controversion of the misrepresentation constantly
indulged in by the press, that the Roman Catholic clergy wish to get
the entire control of a portion of the money annually granted by the
State in aid of education, for no other purpose than to teach religion
in secular schools. All that the Roman Catholics ask is that their
schools may be placed under Government inspection, and that certificates
that children in those schools have reached the standard required in
reading, writing, arithmetic, grammar, and geography, should be given
exactly as they are given in State schools, and that a payment should
be made accordingly. Would any religious training be paid for by
that transaction P None whatever. Then again, the Bishop of Ballarat
(Dr. O?Connor) says in his petition ?
? That we feel it a great grievance to be compelled, through the general taxes,
to pay our share of the enormous educational expenses of the country, and to
receive in return a system of education which, on account of its exclusion of
religion, is opposed to the dictates of our conscience and the principles of our
faith, and, therefore, practically unavailable for us.?
This assertion is made by a man who is at the head of a large diocese ;
and another ecclesiastic of the same order (Dr. Crane) repeats the
statement in his petition ; and yet these persons and the large popula-
tion they thoroughly represent are to be told, forsooth, that they
really don?t know what they are asking for. They are to be told that
they don?t understand their own belief?what is binding on their
consciences?and that, therefore, their request cannot be acceded to.
However, I do not think that the public mind, when it has awakened
to the subject, will consent to the continuance of the grievous
injustice which these petitioners complain of. Not only do the
Roman Catholics contribute their fair proportion to the general
taxation, but they have to put their hands in their own pockets for
the maintenance of their own schools for conscientious reasons which
they have declared publicly, and which cannot be gainsaid ; and yet
the Roman Catholics are not the most wealthy portion of this
community. They consist chiefly of farmers, labourers, and persons
in trade. There are very few wealthy persons among them. And yet


this poor class are compelled, by the operation of the law, to pay
taxes for the maintenance of State schools in which the children of
parents who are well-to-do are educated free, and at the same time
they are called upon to support their own schools out of their own
pockets for conscientious reasons which they cannot give up. In any
fair-dealing community, with regard to any arrangement between two
parties, would such a system be considered equitable or just ? The
second and third paragraphs of the petition are as follows :
? That our grievance is made more manifest by the compulsory clauses of the
Education Act, which, in effect, though not in terms, require us either to sacrifice
our conscience, by sending our children to the State schools, or tax ourselves a
second time, by sending them to schools where we must pay for their education.
? That this law, which virtually forces on us either of these alternatives, seems
to us irreconcilable with the spirit of our Constitution, which guarantees us liberty
of conscience ; with the principles of our courts of equity, which uphold the
father?s right to determine the character of the education his child should receive ;
and, finally, with the principles of justice, which entitle us to receive from the
State, in return for our portion of the taxes, some advantage which we could avail
ourselves of without violating conscience.?
This allusion to the ? spirit of our Constitution ? is not merely based
upon the tenor and provisions of the Constitution Act, which give
liberty of conscience to all in matters of religion, but also upon the
legislation which has arisen therefrom. I particularly refer to a
measure relating to the swearing of oaths of allegiance of office, which
was passed by this Legislature some two or three years after the Con-
stitution Act came into operation. The preamble of that Act is as
follows :
? Whereas the civil and religious rights of all Her Majesty?s subjects in Victoria
are, and ought to be, absolutely equal irrespective of their faith or form of belief :
And whereas for the purpose of openly recognizing and continuing such equality
and of removing anything which may be deemed or construed to separate or
distinguish any class of such subjects in this colony from any other class thereof,
and in order to promote the harmony and welfare of the people, it is expedient to
provide and establish two uniform oaths or affirmations of allegiance and office
respectively, in lieu of the oaths and declaration now by law required in that
behalf. ?
For the purpose here stated the measure was framed so as to place all
subjects of Her Majesty within the colony upon terms, with respect to
the taking of oaths and affirmations, agreeable to their several
consciences; and eight or nine years afterwards ?in 1866 or 1867 ?
I had the pleasure of witnessing the adoption, by the House of
Commons, of a kindred measure, whereby all differences with respect
to the oaths of office taken by a certain class of officials ?the governors
of colonies, for example ?were entirely removed. I take it that the
Victorian Act I allude to may he regarded as laying down the principle,
which the Imperial Parliament subsequently accepted, that no injustice
W'hatever to people on account of their conscientious beliefs was con-
templated by the Legislature. The next paragraph of the petition
states:?
? That the latest legislation in England upon primary education recognizes the
right of the poorest parent whose children are educated at the public expense to
select whatever school his judgment may approve.?


That shows that parental control in educational affairs is recognized by
the law of England as a simple matter of justice. The next paragraph
is the following :
? That we shall never cease to use all constitutional means to obtain from the
Legislature the recognition of our just claims with regard to the education of our
children.?
I think it will be admitted on all hands that the fact of Parliament
being petitioned in the way and to the extent it is, after the Education
Act has been five years in operation, affords undeniable proof that the
Eoman Catholic body are not content with the present state of the
law r , that it is utterly useless to expect that finally they will be
reconciled to it, and that, therefore, the assertion contained in the
words I have just read will be fully borne out by events. A further
paragraph of the petition is as follows :
? That it cannot be inferred from the alleged increase of Catholic children in the
State schools throughout the country that Catholics are becoming reconciled to the
State system, as that increase must be attributable to the more stringent enforce-
ment of the compulsory clauses of the Act, and must occur only in those districts
where the Catholics are either too few or too scattered to support a school of
their own.?
No doubt an argument of some sort will be founded on a query of this
kind : ?? If the present secular system is so much opposed to the
conscientious opinions of Eoman Catholics, how is the fact that a
number of their children go to State schools accounted for?? But it
appears from the petition that that question is answered on two
grounds ?first, that by the more stringent enforcement of the compul-
sory provisions of the Education Act, making it imperative that parents
should send their children to some school, they are, for want of means
to establish schools of their own, or to educate their children in their
own houses, obliged to send them to a State school; and, secondly,
that in the districts of the colony where Eoman Catholics are thinly
settled, they are unable, because of the limited nature of their means,
and the suddenness of the action which upset all their former
educational plans, to organize at the present time any general system
of education for themselves, especially amongst the poorer classes.
Therefore, in fairness, the argument I allude to cannot be said to have
any genuine foundation. The fact that some Eoman Catholic parents
send their children to State schools has only this meaning; that they
have really no other alternative, because they are reduced to the
necessity of saying?? We object to the system of State schools, as
most unjust to us ; but we have only the choice between two evils,
namely, of either letting our children grow up in absolute ignorance,
or of sending them to receive secular instruction at the hands of the
State.? Their use of State schools to that extent can never be consti-
tuted an argument to prove that they assent to the State system. An
overwhelming contradiction to every assumption of the kind is afforded
by the circumstance that wherever in the various centres of population
they are in numbers sufficient for the purpose, they have built school-
houses, engaged masters and mistresses of their ow r n, and provide,


under the greatest possible disadvantages and difficulties, for all their
own educational wants. This is not done in any spirit of bravado
against the law, nor any unwillingness to fall in with the views of their
fellow-citizens, but simply because their conscience forbids them to
employ the educational means provided by the State under the
Education Act. I assert that the argument on the side of Roman
Catholics, which is comprised in their self-sacrifice in this direction?
in not only the rich but others among them putting their hands into
their pockets in order to provide their children in divers ways with
separate education, while they at the same time pay in the shape of
taxation their share of the cost of the State education they object to
make use of?is amply sufficient to prove that their principles in the
matter are something which they will never yield. Be it remembered,
moreover, that this sort of thing is no novelty. Look at any country
you like ?America, Germany, trance, England, Irel nd, or Scotland ?
and you will find conscientious Roman Catholics pursuing precisely
the same course there. Surely then to attribute to the Roman
Catholics of Victoria any special peculiarity of feeling in the matter is
utterly absurd. So much are their principles on this point respected
in England that, according to the latest statements on the subject that
have come to hand, the school boards of London have absolutely
handed over the education of Roman Catholic children to Roman
Catholic schools. That is done in deference to the conscientious
feelings of the Roman Catholics in the metropolis. Instances of
a similar knd are to be found in almost every country, and
our own industrial and reformatory schools as well. There can
be no doubt whatever that the feeling which I describe as
existing among the Roman Catholics of Victoria exists among
Roman Catholics throughout the world. As a matter of course,
I find that those who take a certain part in the discussion of
public affairs are, with respect to the present question, necessarily
driven to attribute mothes. Thus we hear of ?the Catholic organiza-
tion? or ? the Catholic vote? as something of such tremendous power
that an election candidate is ofien told that unless he gets it in his
favour he will not be returned. I cannot say much for it myself,
because once or twice I have found it exercised against me. It does
not appear, therefore, that the particular way in which this supposed
great influence is exercised is always very clearly defined. 1 regret
deeply that in this colony so many subjects that ought to have nothing
to do with politics are thoroughly mixed up with them. For example,
until this educational question is settled it is impossible to hold a
general election without finding it crop up on every side. Therefore
the sooner the difficulty is removed out of the way the better will it be
for the social interests of the country. A great many persons seem
very fond of saying?? Why cannot a Catholic do with respect to edu-
cation what is done by Protestants, and people of no religion at all ??
But why should such a question ever be put ? Has it not always been
recognized throughout the world that conscience is a paramount
influence, and something above all secular authority? Have not
despots?whether monarchs or Parliaments?always had to yield in the


end on tins point, no matter how long they stood out against it ?
Take the earlier days of the Roman Empire. It did not seem much to
ask a man to swear by the genius of the emperor, yet, rather than
comply with the request, thousands went to martyrdom, and the whole
world applauds what they did. Take the Jews. Have they ever
renounced the law of Moses at the instance of any Legislature that
ever was constituted ? Have they not, over and over again, sacrificed
their civil rights and suffered all manner of persecution, sooner than
go against their conscience on that point? AVere they not for a long
time, because they would not swear ?on the true faith of a Christian,?
excluded from the British House of Commons ; and has not the
Imperial Parliament had, within our own day, to admit them on their
own terms ? In the same way, for several hundred years, Roman
Catholics were excluded from the British Parliament because they
would not take the oath of supremacy; but in the end it was the
Legislature, not the Catholic body, that had to yield, and let them in
on their own terms, which are now made the law of the realm. The
same thing has occurred in innumerable instances. Legislatures must
yield to conscience, which is beyond their function and control*
Directly they enter its domain they commit an unjustifiable act, and
if the point is contested they are always finally worsted. The next
paragraph of the petition is the following:?
?That the Catholic schools which have been kept in operation since the with-
drawal from them of State aid have now a larger number on their rolls, and a higher
average attendance, than heretofore.?
I believe that not only is that statement perfectly correct, but also
that the education afforded in Catholic schools is*as good as, if it is
not superior to, that which is given in State schools. At the same
time I am sure the cost of the former is much less than that of the
latter. The petition goes on to state?
? That they much misrepresent us who say that it is not the laity hut the pastors
of the church who are keeping alive the agitation upon the education question, for
in all matters, not only of faith but morals, the laity must ever be united with their
pastors.?
Those nho lake the smallest, trouble to acquaint themselves with the
history of the Roman Catholic church are bound to admit that no
layman of that body can sever himself from its authority. If he does
so sever himself he ceases to be a member of the church at all. In
order to belong to the church he must accept its doctrines and teachings.
That is an indispensable condition. One of its doctrines is that its
children must be educated in secular and religious matters together,
and no one who does not accept that view of the case, but decides for
himself differently, can truly describe himself as a member of the
Roman Catholic body. It is impossible to deny that this doctrine has
been openly expressed by the church on all necessary occasions. I
now come to the concluding paragraph of the petition, which is as
follows :
? That in conclusion, we suggest, ns a practical remedy for our grievances, that
the inspectors appointed under the Education Act visit our schools, and examine


?our children in the same subjects of secular instruction as they do in the State
?schools; and upon their report and certificate let payment be made, directly to the
teachers?
Not to the priests, as the newspapers say.
?for results upon any equitable principle that will allow equal remuneration for
equal work in our schools as in those of the State,?
That is the prayer of the petitioners, and it points out the way in
which they desire to settle the difficulty. They say they will give the
State every guarantee that Homan Catholic scholars shall receive a
secular education, and keep up a rate of attendance equal to that
?obtained in State schools. Why will not the State accept the propo-
sition ? What hinders the arrangement? If under it children do not
.attain the proper amount of efficiency in reading, writing, arithmetic,
geography, and grammar, not one penny is asked for in their behalf.
It is not suggested that the State shall be put to any expenditure
whatever on account of Catholic children except after a full examina-
tion with respect to their proficiency, and upon the certificate of a
school inspector chosen by the State itself. What objection on the
.ground of justice and equity can there be to this plan? One of the
promoters of the Education Act once stated that he would take care,
if he could, to hinder the growth of the Catholic church in Victoria.
The meaning of that is that he would use the power of the State to
prevent that church having any more schools, if the present educa-
tional system, against which the petitioners protest, was designed on
politico-religious grounds, why should it be continued ? Why should
the individual I allude to have any authority on the subject in the
?country ? I am happy to say he has now no such authority. He
belongs to the class described in the old lines ?
? He that fights and runs away
May live to fight another day ;
For those that fly may fight again,
Which he can never do that?s slain.?
He has retired gracefully to another and more dignified position,
namely, the Supreme Court Bench, where he enjoys a comfortable
provision for life. Surely he ought not to have mentioned what I
?allude to as his motive for introducing the Education Act. I would
not refer to the subject now, seeing he is no longer a member of the
Assembly, but for the fact that he endeavoured to cast upon my
administration of the former educational law of the country a slur for
which he had not the smallest justification or ground. 1 have now
pretty nearly finished dealing with the subject I have brought under
the notice of the House, I trust I have said nothing that can be
construed to mean that I have any personal or special interest in the
question, or any desire to embarrass the present or any succeeding
Government by placing it upon a political basis. My desire is rather
to withdraw the subject of education from the arena of politics. I
simply ask that if the primary education of all the children of the
country is to be at the charge of the State, the thing shall not be


carried on according to the existing system, which may be said to have
failed in two essential points, tn the first place, it has suppressed
parental authority, parental rights, and parental responsibility, in
order that the State might assume them. It has constituted children
the children of the State rather than of their parents. That is a
thoroughly false principle, and so far as it has been adopted under the
Education Act so far has the Act failed. If it is, as was admitted
the other night, a wrong proceeding, in connection with our indus-
trial and reformatory schools, to encourage parents to get rid of the
charge of their children, it is equally so in connexion with State
schools, to absolve them from their parental responsibilites with respect
to the education of their children, by withdrawing from them any
necessity to pay, at least according to their means, for that education.
What do we see every day to be the consequence of that state of
things P Troops of magnificently dressed children, the offspring of
parents worth �.8,000, �I,OOO, and �5,000 a year, sent to the State
schools of the country as pauper children. (? No.?) They are
practically pauper children, inasmuch as the act of their parents, in
not paying for their education, but letting the State do so, is the act
of paupers. There is no denying the conclusion?no getting away
from the inference. They put their hands into the Treasury till,
in order to get their children?s schooling paid for, although part of
that payment comes out of the pockets of those who are compelled,
for reasons of conscience, to refrain from availing themselves of the
State system of education, and to send their children to private or
separate schools. What difference is there between that and the plan
adopted by paupers P
Mr. MIJNUO. ?The State schools are like the public roads of the
colony.
Sir J. O?SHANASST. ?In no way are they alike. There is no
parallel between the public roads and the State schools. Public roads
involve no conscientious considerations. They are something which
every one can use alike without any objection. There is no getting
away from this with respect to State schools, that all have to contribute
to their cost while some are disabled from using them, because their
conscience forbids them to do so.
Mr. McINTTEE. ?Why does their conscience so forbid them ?
Sir J. O'SHANASSY. ?They are custodians of their own consciences,
but not ?so the Education Act says in effect ?of their own money.
The law proposes that all shall pay for what all cannot use. That is
the fundamental fault of the system, and it will last so long as the
proper remedy is not applied. The Legislature is not justified in
attempting to suppress conscientious objections to anything, because
matters of conscience are beyond its domain. Another statement put
forward, particularly in the press, is that to grant the prayer of the
petitioners, and establish payment by results, will be simply making
the State pay for religious teaching. That is a truly comic argument,,
for which there is no foundation whatever. If the Catholics build their
own schools out of their own money, and merely ask the State to pay
for the secular education imparted in those schools, how is the State


compromised by the fact that with that secular education religious'
education will also be given ? For that religious education- the State
does not and would not have to pay one farthing. No payment on
that account is sought for in any way. In a new country like this it
appears to me there is nothing more desirable than that all divisions
arising out of religious differences should be removed in order that
society may be amalgamated on the only possible basis, that of social
harmony. Nothing is more certain than that no social amalgamation-
brought about by mere force of law can last. It never has lasted, and
never will last. Therefore, the only way to bring about social harmony
on the present question is to concede to those who have conscientious
objections to the State educational system what they ask, namely, that
the State, which pays in one w r ay for the secular education of other
children, should pay in another way for the secular education of
Catholic children. They seek for nothing more. I have seen it stated
somewhere that if payment by results were once granted with respect
to Roman Catholic children, the same concession would be at once
demanded by other religious bodies. Let me deal with that point at
once. During the time the Education Act has been in operation, has
any other religious denomination asked for any privileges with regard
to education beyond those they at present enjoy ? Not one of them
has applied for anything of the kind.
Mr. MUNEO.?They knew that if they did apply they would not
get it.
Sir J O?SHANASSY.?How can the honourable member for
Carlton, who has often told us of what a minority in this Chamber
once suffered from the gag of the ? iron hand,? know that if such a
request were ever made it would not be granted? If any large section
of the community were to object to the State educational system in
the same way as the present petitioners object to it, and were to make
an appeal to the Legislature on the subject, offering strong grounds
why what they asked for should be conceded, I have not the slightest
doubt their request would receive the attention of Parliament, and
that the honourable member for Carlton, as well as every other
honourable member, would, if he thought their prayer reasonable, be
quite ready to yield to it. Honourable members are obliged to con-
form to public opinion. But at present no such opinion has been
expressed, nor do we know that any religious body in the colony, save
the Roman Catholics, have any conscientious objections to the principle
upon which the State schools are established. Perhaps, however, such
objections are entertained by several religious bodies, who have not
yet spoken on the subject, and are for the present quiescent, simply
because they regard the proceedings in connection with the Education
Act as a sort of storm which will pass over by-and-by, when they will
get their rights without a struggle. Supposing they were to make an
application to the Legislature like that now made by the Roman
Catholics, and offering the same terms, namely, to build their own
schools, and receive payment for only the secular education their chil-
dren received, what objection would there be to complying with
their request ?


Mr. McINTYRE.?Our educational system would then be a
denominational one.
Sir J. O?SHANASST.?Not at all. If any of the other religious
bodies were to simply ask for what the Roman Catholics now ask,
namely, that while they themselves pay for the religious instruction
imparted to their children the State should pay for their secular
-education, what ground would there be for talking about
denominationalism ? None whatever. Besides, I am not so much
alarmed at the w'ord ? denominationalism ? as I might be. I don?t
see the bugbear. What is the offence in people holding religious
beliefs according to their consciences as Roman Catholics, members of
the Church of England, Presbyterians, Independents, Wesleyans, or
Baptists ? What wrong does conscientious feeling on the subject of
religion do ? What evil 1o society does it cause ? Why should Par-
liament endeavour to suppress it? For my part, I prefer that Roman
Catholics, and members of every other religious denomination, should
be able to practice their religion and carry it out to the fullest
extent.
Mr. McINTYRE.?And so say all of us.
Sir J. O?SIIANASSY.?Then let the honourable member carry out
what he professes. And now with regard to the effect the continuance
of the present educational system in Victoria will have upon the
Australian colonies as a wdiole. Possibly I may be credited with a
strong desire to see Australia flourish and prosper, and that throughout
its borders all evil feelings on religious grounds should be entirely
allayed. How will our prospect of such a state of things be advanced
by Victoria persevering in her present educational system, which her
neighbours have carefully examined, and thoroughly disagree with?
It is regarded by Queensland and New South Wales as expensive
and ?to use an expression applied to it by a member of the New
South Wales Government??gaudy,? and something that will not last.
A number of persons even in this colony are of the same opinion, but
they desire to let the thing go on, because they consider that that is
the only way in which its downfall can be brought about. They
advise patience, considering that the system will die out of itself, if
there is no agitation against it. That was the recommendation given
to me by a large number of members of my own religious communion.
But would I be taking up a respectable position if, conceiving that a
great wrong was being done, I refrained from letting the light of day
in upon it ? Is it not more manly and honourable for a citizen of
this free community to make known the grievances he sees in existence,
rather than hide them in the hope that some day they may bring about
their own remedy ? Looking to the future of the Australian colonies,
I want to know what possible bond amongst us there can be, if, on a
subject like that of education, we are to be divided from the start ?if
we are not to be animated by an earnest desire to hold together, and
unite, where it is possible for the common good ? Is it not certain
that, by dealing with subjects of general interest like education, in
such a w r ay as to create and promote divisions and disagreements, we
are retarding the progress of the continent ? A great authority,


looking at the growth of the early American colonies, was so struck'
with admiration at the circumstance of people going out to a new
world there to enjoy the most perfect liberty of conscience, that he
was impelled to exclaim, in language which ought to be also applicable
to these colonies :
? Lo ! smiling forward on rejoicing suns,
Gay colonies advance,
The calm retreat of undeserved distress,
The better home of those whom fortune chased from distant lands ;
Not built on rapine, servitude, or woe,
But, bound by social freedom, firm they rise!?
I will conclude by asking the Minister of Public Instruction if the
Government intend to grant the prayer of the petitions to which I
have called attention ; and if so, when?
At the conclusion of his speech the honourable member was
loudly cheered.
