PREFACE.
In September, 1873, my friend Mr. J. L. Bonython, of the S. A.
Advertiser, suggested that I should write two or three articles
on Law Reform. I consented, and the result was that I wrote
the Articles now reprinted. More mature consideration has
convinced me that they are, in some respects, jejune and un-
philosophical. Such as they are, however, they scandalised the
profession, and the general public viewed them as the dreams of
an enthusiast. At the present time the majority of the profession
and the public seem to accord in the view that in the main the
opinions expressed are correct.
Since the above date, the English Judicature Acts have come
into force, which ignored the cardinal points of the reform indi-
cated by the report of the English Judicature Commission re-
ferred to in Article YII., retaining a system of pleading and the
injurious centralization of administration. South Australia and
Queensland have adopted measures based upon those Acts. In
England, South Australia and Queensland, the results are the
same. The costs of litigation have rather increased than
diminished. The perplexity of the old procedure seems to be
equalled by the perplexity of the new procedure. Greater
speed in obtaining a judicial decision is undoubtedly attained,
but this is as much due to the more frequent sittings of the
Courts as to any peculiar excellencies of the new practice.
Further reflection and study have convinced me that the
scheme of Reform effected by the Judicature Acts is illusionary ;
that the Report of the Judicature Commissioners is not founded
on true principles, being designed to give enlarged powers to the
legal mind in the administration of the law instead of preserving
and strengthening the very small existing influence of the lay
mind. I am ventilating these later views in a series of Articles
in the S. A. Advertiser. I. and 11. appeared in that paper of
dates 2nd and 28th September, 1880.
A middle stage of thought is expressed in the Appendix, con-
taining a copy of a Petition presented to the House of Assembly
by Mr? Lavington Glyde about two years ago at my request.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS
OF A
LAW REFORMER.
Being a Series of Articles reprinted from the ?South Australian
Advertiser ? of September and October , 1873.
No. I.
Law reform is a popular subject so far as appreciation of its
advantages are concerned, but it is a decidedly unpopular subject
for discussion as to bow and by what means improvement is to
be attained. Most South Australians can appreciate the Real
Property Act, but there are few who, like Sir Richard Torrens,
have the ability and inclination to attack a cumbrous system of
legal procedure. His Act may be defective, but its defects are
not so much matter of surprise as that so large an instalment of
reform should have been effected by a single measure, prepared
by a layman, and carried despite the most strenuous professional
opposition. Why should not Supreme Court procedure be sus-
ceptible of similar amendment ? The mysteries of Common
Law practice are not more hidden than those of conveyancing
according to the old school of English lawyers. The field is open;
all that is wanted is the master hand which will unlock the gates
of justice and render them easy and accessible to all alike, whe-
ther rich or poor, conserving the absolute right of the public to
the simplest, cheapest, and most expeditious remedies that can be
devised. It is to be feared, however, that to attack the Supreme
Court itself by some large and comprehensive scheme, fusing its
different jurisdictions and assimilating to one common form all
its varieties of procedure, is too gigantic an undertaking to be
looked for at present. No doubt such a scheme must eventually
be devised, but to fix its date would be as difficult a task as to


predict to a would-be suitor bis day of final judgment in our
Supreme Court. But if the forms of its procedure cannot yet
be attacked they may be sapped.
Any one who will take the trouble to compare the course of
proceeding followed in our Supreme Court in an action at law,
with that of our Local Courts, cannot fail to be struck by the
immense superiority of the latter over the former. In the
Supreme Coiirt it may safely be asserted that no layman has yet
ventured to draw his own pleadings and conduct his own case till
ripe for trial without professional assistance. Few, indeed, are
the instances in which a suitor has had the hardihood or the con-
fidence to conduct the trial of his own case. In the Local Courts
there is nothing in the practice to prevent every man from being
his own lawyer. Persons frequently issue their own summonses
and conduct their own cases without any help whatever from
legal men. In the Supreme Court the costs on both sides attendant
upon the trial of a cause can hardly be estimated at less than
�IOO. Frequently they amount to between �3OO and �4OO, and
the sad experience of suitors will confirm the statement that even
this latter sum cannot be taken as an extreme limit. In the.Local
Courts the cost of a similar action may be estimated at a sum
varying according to the amount in dispute?between a few shil-
lings and �2O. But the most striking feature of the suggested
comparison has yet to be noticed ?the difference between the two
tribunals in the all-important matter of the time elapsing between
the commencement and final determination of the proceedings.
In the Local Court a plaintiff may reasonably expect to reap the
fruits of a successful action within a month?that is, provided
there is no appeal to the Supreme Court. Should a Local Court
suitor be drawn by an appeal to the higher Court, its cumbrous
and wearisome proceedings may extend the time by some two or
three months?a delay vexatious enough, it must be confessed,
but far preferable to the ordinary course of a Supreme Court
action, which w r e will now consider. A suitor in the Supreme
Court may deem himself most fortunate if, in spite of the delays
in pleading, he brings his cause to trial in six weeks from the
issue of his writ. More often than not this interval may be
reckoned by months instead of weeks. After the trial the much-
abused practice of obtaining a rule nisi upon every conceivable
point that technical ingenuity can suggest comes into play. After
the granting of the rule nisi a considerable time elapses before
the argument ?a time which cannot be estimated even approxi-
mately. Anything is seized hold of and admitted as an excuse
for delay here ; a marriage and death in the family of either
counsel or of one of the Judges seems to be quite a legitimate
ground for putting off the cause. Then when at length the argu-
ment is concluded, the judgment is commonly reserved, and auo-


ther interval occurs, which may be calculated at from one to
eighteen months, before the final judgment is given, unless indeed
the cause itself dies out, as has sometimes happened, in which
case the judgment is never given at all. If the rule nisi is made
absolute the delays are again repeated, till many a disappointed
and purse-exhausted suitor is driven into the Insolvent Court?a
step which invokes ideas of wretchedness, not only to the suitor,
but to his wife and children, too distressing to be here dilated
upon.
It need perhaps hardly be said that this comparison is designed
solely to bring into a popular view the defects of procedure
attendant upon remedies sought in the Supreme Court, and is in
nowise intended as disrespectful to the Judges, who administer an
imperfect system.
In view of all these advantages possessed by the Local Courts,
it is evident that an extension of their present limited jurisdiction
would be a most desirable instalment of law reform. It would
relieve the Supreme Court of a large number of the smaller cases
now necessarily subject to that tribunal. It would tend towards
that bringing of justice to every man?s door, so desiderated by
earnest law reformers. Rich men having heavy interests at stake
might still indulge in the luxury of a Supreme Court action, but
these are just the persons and these are just the interests which
can best afford the prolixity and expense of that form of pro-
ceeding. Poorer individuals, to whom that prolixity and expense
are simply ruinous, would find cheap and expeditious justice in
the inferior tribunals, instead of being, as now, compelled into
buying justice too dearly in the higher Court, In short, every
reason which can be found in support of the creation and exist-
ence of Local Courts at all, may fairly be urged in aid of the
extension of their jurisdiction. The lawyers might suffer, and
no doubt will find objections ? but the interest of the general
body of the public being involved, there remains scarcely a doubt
that when the community awake to a sense of the advantages
they will abtain by the proposed amendment, a Bill to enlarge the
jurisdiction of the Local Courts will meet with unqualified
approval.
No. 11.
In a previous article a comparison was drawn between the
Supreme Court and the Local Court in the matter of the three
essentials of all legal procedure, viz., simplicity, economy, and
expedition. The unprejudiced mind will come to a conclusion not
flattering to the higher Court as the result of the comparison.


It may be argued that the Supreme Court has the advantage of
a greater exactness in the administration of the law. This posi-
tion may be conceded, but without affecting the opinion that this
exactness may be too dearly purchased by litigants. Practically,
the position cannot be impugned that a decision simple, inex-
pensive, and speedy, is what suitors require, and that a Local
Court decision may be made as acceptable to the bulk of suitors
as one of a higher Court.
A short view will now be taken of the two tribunals them-
selves, in order to bring under notice a grave and fundamental
defect in the constitution of the lesser Court. A general glance
only will be attempted. Provisions affecting the title to land,
certiorari, and other matters are purposely excluded, so that the
subject may not assume a character which might perhaps perplex
non-professional readers.
In the Supreme Court the trial is presided over by a Judge,
who decides matters of law and keeps the evidence adduced
within exact and defined limits. The Jury decides questions of
fact, and is composed of twelve men drawn by ballot from the
panel or list of jurors summoned. Their impartiality is so
anxiously protected that if the summoning officer is concerned in
an action, or related to either party, he is even forbidden to ex-
ercise his purely ministerial office. If by some oversight he has
summoned the Jury, the whole body may at once be challenged
by either litigant, and a new Jury must be summoned. Either
party has further a peremptory right of challenge to six of the
Jurymen as they are balloted for from the list of those summoned.
When a Jury has thus been selected, about whose impartiality
there can be no doubt, the trial is proceeded with. After verdict,
either party dissatisfied with the ruling of the Judge as to law,
or the decision of the Jury as to facts, can obtain the decision of
the Full Court, composed of three learned Judges, by obtaining
a rule nisi for a new trial.
The Local Court is presided over by a Special Magistrate, who
may or may not be a lawyer. The Court of Limited Jurisdiction
adjudicates over matters involving sums under �2O. The Special
Magistrate sitting alone usually constitutes the Court, and there
is no appeal whatever, so that his decision is absolutely final and
conclusive. The Local Court of Full Jurisdiction consists of the
Special Magistrate and two Justices. It decides causes where
the disputed amount is between �2O and �lOO. Either party
may require a Jury of four. An appeal to the Supreme Court
lies when the amount involved exceeds �3O, on questions of law
only. No appeal lies on questions of fact. Thus all questions
of fact are left solely to the Local Court. Questions of law
arising out of the facts so found may, when the amount exceeds
�3O, be decided by the Supreme Court.


By the 13th Clause of the Local Court Act, 1861, all actions
are to be determined ? according to equity and good conscience,
and the substantial merits of the case..? By the 61st Clause of
the same Act, appeals to the Supreme Court are to be dismissed
? if the Court shall he of opinion that although the ruling objected
to may not have been strictly according to law, yet that substantial
justice has been done between the parties.?
These clauses afford an objection to the constitution of the
Courts under discussion of the gravest and most serious character.
It is the constant aim of law-makers and of law administrators
to introduce and preserve a uniform current of decisions. This
is desired in order that some arbitrary standard may always be
accessible, that every individual may know what the law pre-
scribes, may know his rights and his wrongs, his privileges and
his duties, and his remedies, so that in any given case a man may
be able to say with some approach to certainty what the result
of an appeal to law will be. Uniformity of precedent is aimed
at in order to give this certainty with as much exactness as pos-
sible. It is the theory of the law to be unchangeable in its princi-
ples and inflexible in their application, so that if a rich man
under a given state of facts obtains a favorable decision, a poor
man may rely on that decision and know that under a similar
state of facts a similar result will be attained. We will not now
discuss the abstract theory itself. It is sufficient to point out
that such a theory is the primary basis of the whole system of
law, as indeed the word itself implies.
Now, the most experienced Special Magistrate in the province
has been heard to express his embarrassment with regard to these
provisions. If he is to decide according to law his course appears
clear. If bound by these clauses he is to decide according to the
dictates of his own conscience. In case of an appeal to the
Supreme Court, the average consciences of the three Judges are
to determine the matter. In the most able and upright of men
there is no arbitary code of conscience, no standard of agree-
ment by which they are universally bound. Differences between
Jurymen?between opposing litigants, each of whom conscien-
tiously believes that he is morally right ; nay, the experiences of
the common affairs of every-day life will convince the most un-
reflecting how uncertain and varying is the result of an appeal
to conscience. Yet it is precisely this appeal which it is enacted
shall be administered in Local Courts. What a grim sarcasm
upon law ! The Supreme Court, when appealed to on any ques-
tion of law (and it is only on these questions it can be appealed
to), is to guide its decision by ? good conscience.? The exact-
ness of law, which it is the boast of the Supreme Court to
administer, becomes nugatory. Uniform as it may strive to
render its judgments in other cases where precedent is accepted,


in Local Court cases the Supreme Court is to be guided by ? the
substantial merits of the case, by equity and good_ conscience 5 5
a principle as varying and uncertain in its application as the
winds of heaven in their direction. The practical result of the
clauses in question is that the decision of a Local Court in one
case may be diametrically opposed to its judgment in another.
No certainty is obtained from a decision, even on appeal. Every
case being decided according to ? good conscience,? reference to
precedent or rule of law is utterly unavailing, and justice becomes
an incoherent jumbled mass.
Another and most dangerous aspect of the subject is not
unworthy of notice. In the numerous Limited Jurisdiction cases
the Special Magistrate, sitting as Judge and Jury, gives an abso-
lute and final judgment as to what is the law, and also as to the
result of the facts. There is no appeal from his decision. Objec-
tion can be made to a juryman in the Supreme Court, whose
weight in a case is only one-thirteenth, either on grounds of
of prejudice, the suspicion of partiality, or even without any
ground whatever \ but no litigant can object to a Special Magis-
trate except on the ground of direct personal interest. And fur-
ther, no decisions in these Limited Jurisdiction cases, uugoverned
as they are by precedent, can be objected to, even before the
tribunal of public opinion. The answer would undoubtedly "be,
u I decide according to equity and good conscience, and the sub -
stantial merits of the case, pursuant to the Act I administer.
These powers are too extensive to be left in the hands of any man,
and it is to be hoped that the above considerations will have their
weight when any reform of the Local Court Act is attempted,
and that the equity and good conscience clauses referred to will
be abrogated. The taint of unprovable suspicion should be
utterly discarded from the administration of justice.
No. 111.
As illustrative of the difficulty experienced by the operation
of the ? equity and good conscience? 5 clauses of the Local Courts
Act, two cases may be cited. These cases, be it borne in mind,
are examples merely, and are only referred to because instances
are more striking to the popular mind than arguments founded
upon general principles. In Brooks v. Gardiner (Adelaide Local
Court* 25th June, 1872), the judgment of the Court proceeded
on the assumption that although the plaintiff according to law
might not strictly be entitled to a verdict, yet that ? equity and
good conscience? were in his favor ; and he obtained a judgment.
In Waples v. Crouch (Adelaide Local Court, 22nd January, 1873),


it was held that the plaintiff could not by means of ? equity and
good conscience? entitle himself to a verdict unsustainable by law.
Any intention here to impugn the correctness o� either of these
decisions is disclaimed. They are simply quoted as exemplifying
the difficulty caused by the clauses the subject of objection, and
for the reason above adverted to.
Eeference may also be made to the fact that these 11 good con-
science? clauses are wholly admitted from the Victorian County
Courts Act.
The weak point of a Local Court of Limited Jurisdiction is
that its absolute powers as a final Court without appeal are
usually exercised by a Special Magistrate, sitting alone as Judge
and from whose decision there is no escape. In the Supreme
Court, as we have seen, any Juryman may be challenged by a litigant
simply from dislike, without assigning any cause, and this chal-
lenge may be repeated to proposed Jurymen six times. In the
Limited Local Court, on the contrary, no challenge or ground of
objection to a Magistrate is admitted, save direct personal interest.
He may be deemed most objectionable, either in his capacity of
Judge or in his office of Jury, Still no means are provided by
which a dissatisfied litigant may obtain the decision of another
tribunal. Any disappointed suitor is, therefore, prone to support
his feeling* that this compulsory and single forum is unjust or
actuated by improper motives, by alleging grounds varying in
importance from the gravest suspicions to the veriest trifles.
Now it is quite as necessary that a Court should possess public
confidence as that it should deserve it. An eminent jurist once
said ? The power of the judiciary rests upon the faith of the
people in its integrity and intelligence. Take away this faith, and
the moral influence of the Courts is gone, and the popular respect
for the law is impaired. Law with us is an abstraction personi-
fied in Courts as its ministers, but its efficacy depends upon the
moral convictions of the people. When confidence in the Courts
is gone, respect for the law itself will speedily disappear, and
society will become the prey of fraud, violence, and crime.?
Weighty language like this irresistibly supports the conviction
that the public urgently require an alteration in the constitution
of the present Local Courts of limited jurisdiction?an alteration
which, while preserving its present characteristics of simplicity,
economy, and dispatch, will at the same time assist to raise these
Courts above the level of suspicion which, from their inherent
nature as now existing, must in some cases, justly or unjustly,
attach to them.
The remedy which combines these essentials is this:?Let a
plaintiff on issuing his summons, or a defendant upon entering
his defence, state, if so minded, his wish that the cause shall be
tried hy Justices , and let the trial take place accordingly before


two Justices of the Peace. Two ordinary Magistrates may con-
stitute a Court of Limited Jurisdiction. This plan would have a
tendency similar to the challenge of a Juryman in the Supreme
Court. The aim is to secure a tribunal thought to be impartial.
A Special Magistrate who might be objectionable to either suitor
would thus be precluded from trying the cause. The finality of
the decision of the Court would be preserved ; public confidence
in the impartiality of the Court would he strengthened. From
every point of view the adoption of this suggestion would be
beneficial.
Turning- to the Court of Full Jurisdiction, the fact that there
is no appeal, save on questions of law, becomes prominent. This
limitation of the right of appeal operates most unjustly and in-
juriously. A Presiding Magistrate, whose decisions are appeal-
able to this qualified extent, has his amour propre called into
play. He is substantially the Court, although two J.P.?s sit with
him. He will naturally, voluntarily or involuntarily, strive to
support his law by his facts. In the nature of things he will be
inclined to maintain the correctness of his law by expressly deter-
mining that the facts in evidence (perhaps complex or conflicting)
give the basis for his judgment. Indeed, the boundaries ot the
domain of fact so greatly overlap that of law that whether a par-
ticular question is one of law or of fact is sometimes the most
difficult task tor a lawyer to determine. In the immense majority
of cases brought before any Court a decision that a particular
state of facts exists involves the actual legal result. Whether A
is a partner with B may be a question of fact, or a legal conclu-
sion from facts. If Ais such a partner he will be legally re-
sponsible for certain contracts entered into by B. Now, it an
action be brought against A in respect of such a contract, A dis-
putes the fact that he is a partner ?not the law that it he is a
partner he is responsible. Yet, in such a case, by a radically
vicious system, A is debarred from taking the opinion of the
Supreme Court as to the very fact on which his responsibility
depends. He is (with the facts found against him) limited in his
appeal to a question of law which it is useless for him to dispute.
No substantive reason can be alleged why, if appeals are allowed
at all, a suitor in the Local Court should not have a right to the
opinion of the higher Court as well on the facts as on the law of
the case. We assert most strongly that either the right of appeal
should be wholly taken away, and the Court of Full Jurisdiction
should be made a final Court, in the same manner as the Court
of Limited Jurisdiction now is, or that appeals should be allowed
on the whole of a case. Appeals are permitted, on questions of
fact, from the Police Court to the Local Court itself. They are
allowed from the Insolvency Court. They are admitted from the
nisi prius verdict of a Judge and Jury to the Full Court sitting


in banco. They are allowed in Victoria from tlie County Courts
there. And if allowed at all, it is manifestly unjust that appeals
as to questions of fact should be prohibited. A reform this
respect must accompany the extension of the common law juris-
diction of the Local Courts, the urgent necessity for which we
have already shown to exist.
No. IV.
As already seen, we have insisted that the public have an
absolute right to the simplest, cheapest, and most expeditious
legal remedies that can be devised. Simple ?that every man
may have some knowledge of the procedure necessary to maintain
or to resist an action. Cheap ?that the poorest man may be
able to obtain that justice which by Magna Charta is not to be
bought or sold ; that justice which under the present system of
legal procedure it is a cruel witticism to call his 11 right.? Ex-
peditious ?that no one may be exposed to the wearisome delays
under which a man becomes insolvent, or nearly so, before he
obtains it. We insist that it should not be permitted that a
rogue may point to the intricacy, expense, and delay of legal
procedure as a species of armor which renders him proof against
the attempts of his victims to obtain simple justice.
It appears to be thought in some quarters that reform is not
needed. An instance will therefore now be given which will
exhibit how far the present Supreme Court procedure attains the
first of these requisites, viz., simplicity. How far it affords the
other essentials of inexpensiveness and dispatch may also come
into view. Nevertheless, the point now intended to be shown in
relief is simplicity. The reader will be left to judge for himself
between simplicity according to Supreme Court notions, and
simplicity on the Local Court model.
A Supreme Court declaration is a concise statement of the
plaintiff?s cause of action couched in technical language. In the
Local Court the office of the declaration is generally fulfilled by a
bill of particulars, or a tradesman?s ordinary invoice. Usually
this bill of particulars in a Local Court action may be easily
comprised in a page of foolscap ; it may as easily be prepared by
any one who can i-ead and write. The declaration, with the rest
of the pleadings, is in the Supreme Court read by the plaintiff?s
counsel on the opening of a case. The Judge and Jury thus
obtain some knowledge of the nature of the action about to be
tried.
Once upon a time, in certain legal proceedings, in a certain
Supreme Court, in a certain British colony, the declaration or


statement of the plaintiff?s cause of action was delivered. [lt
consisted of more than six hundred and iifty pages of brief paper,
equal to over one thousand three hundred pages of foolscap,
containing about five thousand common law folios of 72 words
each. The cost of a single copy of this immense monument of
legal art, at the ordinary rate of threepence per folio, would
amount to the trifling sum of sixty-two pounds ten shillings ; and
it would take fifty days to write out such a copy.] The pleas, as
may be imagined, were also somewhat voluminous. They,
however, proved rather less lengthy than the declaration. The
Court, when the simple and concise statement of the plaintiff?s
cause of action was first produced, consisted of three learned and
experienced Judges. Even they were incredulous at first. They
refused to believe that the art of man, or the skill of a pleader,
could manufacture such a simple and concise declaration as was
presented to them. It was only the serious assurance of counsel
that this formidable mass of paper was really the declaration in
the action that at length convinced the Court of the correctness of
the assertion as to this ? question of fact.? On the tidal of the
cause all were happily spared the pending infliction of
having these simple and concise pleadings read. This was
dispensed with by general consent. Consequently, the trial was
had without the plaintiff?s own statement of his cause of action
being read. ? Summa industria et summa diligentia leges Anglice
ad nbsurdum reduxit.? This declaration, it may be admitted, was
worthy of a Court of Brobdignag.
Truth is indeed sometimes stranger than fiction. This is no
plagiarism from a fairy tale or romance writer. It is an un-
deniable fact, though it may rank with some of the stories of
Gulliver. The Court in which this occurred was our Supreme
Court; the British colony was South Australia ; the name of
the cause was, The North Australian Company v. Ulackmore,
commenced three years ago and still unsettled. If the plaintiff
had been a poor man instead of a strong* Company, is it too much
to suppose that ere this he would have sought refuge from such
charming simplicity in the Insolvent Court or the grave 1 Any
incredulous reader may verify the statements as to the length of
the declaration by a visit to the Supreme Court, where the
record of the case is or should be filed. Strict accuracy has not
been attempted. Substantially our description is correct or
understated.
If it should be objected that the above is an extreme case, the
answer is that we are attacking a system which allows such an
extreme case, Surely a modest aspiration for reform in legal
pi'ocedure which admits of ? simplicity ? of this nature may be
permitted. Surely the public may fairly ask that they may be
relieved from burthens such as this. Surely they may be


pardoned for believing that extension of the Local Court juris-
diction is the means by which an instalment of that relief may bo
obtained.
In a legal work upon a barrister?s duties, it is candidly
admitted that ?The attractions of the County Courts to those
who have disputes to try, are such as no reforms in the superior
Courts can rival. The rapidity with which trials can be had, the
convenience of a hearing on the very day appointed, without the
cost and trouble of conveyance of witnesses to a distant place, the
satisfaction of knowing that when a case is tried it is settled,
and cannot be disturbed again ; and again?sources of vexation
to suitors in the superior Courts which more trouble them than
the bill of costs, which tells them that justice can be too dearly
purchased ; these are tangible benefits which suitors will not
readily resign. Improve the Common Law Courts as we will,
they will never compete successfully with the County Courts in
these particulars.?
Every high-minded and conscientious lawyer capable of
elevating himself above petty class instincts will only too readily
aid in a reform which has for its object the public good. The
lower view that profits may be less is a natural one, and may
prompt professional objections, but no jurist worthy of the name
will allow even infinitesimal weight to it.
No. Y.
We have, to some extent, shown the evils attaching to the
present procedure of the Supreme Court, We do not believe
that those, evils are remediless. It is intended now to sketch, in
rough and rapid manner, a plan?of course open to modification
and discussion?which appears to present a feasible remedy for
some of the grievances of which the public have cause to com-
plain. It is too much to be expected that every one will concur
in the proposal. All will, however, admit the gigantic nature of
the evils attempted to be grappled with. One observation, how-
ever, by way of promise.
It is the old and well-abused practice of all Conservatives to
call any suggestion for reform ? an innovation,? and the altered
terra, like some magician?s wand, is sufficient to conjure up a
troop of gibbering spectres of objections. But the hard practical
sense of the present day is not to be diverted by shadows.
Reasoning must be met by reasoning, facts by facts. Wrongs
must be righted, and the temper of the age is such that delay
in redressing admitted evils is thought to be of itself a greater
evil than any other.
The Local Courts, in the main, now administer substantial and
satisfactory justice. This much may be conceded without affect-


ing the position that improvements and amendments in the con-
stitution of those Courts are needed. Some of these amendments
have already been pointed out, others may doubtless be brought
into notice by free ?ventilation? of the subject. The fact, how-
ever, remains that substantially the public are satisfied with the
simple, inexpensive, and speedy remedies afforded by the Local
Courts. This being the case, it may safely be asserted that no
necessity exists for limiting their jurisdiction as a primary Court
to any extent whatever. In the present Act there is a provision
giving these Courts a jurisdiction unlimited as regards the
amount involved, provided that the parties sign and file with the
clerk a consent in writing. The existence of this provision
shows satisfactorily enough that there is nothing which should
necessarily debar them from an unlimited jurisdiction such as is
now contended for. Hitherto this provision has been a dead
letter. Litigants, it is believed, have never availed themselves of
it. One reason?perhaps the principal reason?for this is the
utter impracticability of inducing opposing parties to agree on
any matter connected with their dispute. Each fears that in agree-
ing upon some apparently collateral point he may inadvertently
forego some advantage, or suffer some disadvantage. But there
is little doubt that the majority of disputants would unhesitatingly
prefer the Local Court procedure to the costly and tedious remedies
offered by the Supreme Court. If a suggestion made in a former article
were adopted this preference would be increased by the know-
ledge that an appeal to the Supreme Court on the whole case
both as to fact and law would be open. Suitors would have, as
at present, the option of a trial by Jury, should they prefer it, in
a manner analogous to the present trial by Jury in the Supreme
Court with the incalculable advantages of simplicity of proce-
dure, inexpensiveness of trial, and a speedy determination of the
cause. The certainty in questions of law which is aimed at in
the present system would be preserved by the right of appeal,
which would also answer precisely the same purpose as is now
obtained by a motion for a rule nisi for a new trial after a verdict
in the Supreme Court. Suitors in towns like Kapunda, Crawler,
or Strathalbyn ?not to refer to moi'e distant places?could have
their causes tried almost at their very doors. Thus, too, would
be saved the ruinous cost attending the bringing to Adelaide
from the country of witnesses to loaf about town day after day
in attendance for atrial which, in the Sujireme Court, often takes
place some days after that originally appointed. Even to Jury-
men the plan would afford some slight relief in the matter of
costly and wearisome journeys to and delays in Adelaide at each
Civil Sittings, which meet but scanty recompence in the Govern-
ment allowance. Many causes would be tried without a Jury T .
Instead of being a necessity, as a Jury is now in the Supreme


Court, it would be left optional with suitors to require a Jury or
not, as they pleased. The Judges and Special Magistrates should
meet once a year to consider the administration of justice, in
order to suggest improvements. In important cases, involving
more than �5OO, it might be expedient to give either party a
right, subject to a Judge?s discretion ?the abuse of which right
should be carefully guarded against?to remove the cause to the
Supreme Court. In these cases, under modifications presently
to be mentioned, the trial would take place as at present. Rich
men, with heavy interests at stake, might prefer a trial by the
higher tribunal. It might be well thus to preserve their right to
a luxury which they can afford. The modifications alluded to are
these :?All pleadings, with their attendant intricacy, cost, and
delay, should be abolished. The course of procedure before trial
in cases thus to be removed should be made analogous to that of
the present Local Courts. Power might be reserved to a Judge
to settle, where necessary, the issues to be tried in these cases.
But generally, the practice of the higher and lower tribunals
should be rendered uniform. The Civil Sittings of the Supreme
Court should be held, if necessary, monthly. It should also
sit, say once a fortnight throughout the year, for the purpose of
hearing appeals from the various Local Courts throughout the
countrv. Wrong is perennial. The administration of justice
should be perennial also.
There is one class of litigants to whom the carrying into effect
of these suggestions would be most obnoxious. The defendants
seeking delay only, or a forced compromise, who now avail them-
selves of the too many technical objections that the present pro-
cedure affords ?who render a plaintiff?s proceedings as costly and
protracted as possible?who after having brought him thus
almost to insolvency, offer some miserable compromise which the
weary victim, sick at heart, is only too glad to accept. This class
of litigants it may be supposed will see no benefit in the changes
now suggested, but impudence itself will hardly allow that
their objections are worthy of notice, even though sheltered by
the specious pretence that ? much anxious consideration? ?a
paraphrase for delay?must be had before any alteration is made
in the present state of affairs.
The only objection that appears to us to have any force is that
the extended powers sought to be conferred upon Local Courts
could not safely be entrusted to others than professional men as
Special Magistrates. Weight may be allowed to this objection
for the sake of argument only. Admit it to be sustainable. We
shall meet it. There are now two professional men exercising the
office of Special xMagistrate ?a title which, by the way, might
under the proposed scheme be properly changed to that of Judge,
The objection we have alluded to will therefore not apply to the


Courts presided over by those gentlemen. The extended powers
might be confined to their Courts, and it might be left to the
Governor and Executive Council by proclamation to enlarge the
jurisdiction of the other Courts as might from time to time be
desirable. Thus the change would be effected gradually. As
vacancies occur in the office of non-professional Special
Magistrates, they could be filled by professional men. The
Special Magistrate of the Adelaide Local Court, exex*cising his
?extended jurisdiction, might periodically visit Gawler. Kapunda,
Port Adelaide, and Strathalbyn, so that those important towns
might reap at once the advantages of the new system, while, if
necessary, during his absence from Adelaide his place might be
filled in the Adelaide Local Court by a Judge of the Supreme
Court.
We have thus roughly sketched the outline of a plan which
would place within the reach of all a simplicity combined with
economy and dispatch wholly unattainable under the existing
system. We believe it deserves the most serious attention of the
thinking public. If its leading features meet approval, matters
of detail can be furnished without great difficulty.
It appears that it is not intended during* the present session to
amend the law with regard to Insolvency, Intestacy, Testamentary
Causes, and Real Property, The law on these subjects has for
some years past been a scandal and disgrace to the legislation of
the country. Yet nothing is to be done. So is it with all questions
of law reform. A few more victims must yet be sacrificed to the
legal Moloch?delay. A few more suitors must yet endure the
torturing anguish inflicted by the present procedure. Whether
members of Parliament are to be entitled to free seats in public
conveyances; whether Ministers?(salaries are to be increased?
these are questions which receive the ready and prompt attention.
Days may be wasted in personal abuse and recrimination. Yet
matters touching the vital interests and well-being of the
whole community are to be shelved. It requires the indignant
voice of an angry people to rouse legislators from their apathy,
in order that an all-important subject like law reform shall
receive the attention which is so ui?gently and imperatively
demanded.
No. VI.
The proposition to abolish all technical pleading will of course
encounter the most strenuous opposition. It will be stated that
pleading is already reduced to the simplest possible form, and
that without formal pleading it will be impracticable to raise
issues and properly conduct a trial at law. Precisely similar
objections were urged to the great pleading reform effected some 20


years ago by the Common Law Practice Act. They were then
urged by the supporters of the obsolete and what is now con-
sidered absurd system of special pleading, under which a man s
title to land was liable to be defeated, or his action lost by a
verbal omission, or a misspelt word. It is only natural that
these identical objections should be raised to the present proposal
for a still further extension of reform. Yet the action of eject-
ment is now conducted without any formal pleading. That it is
possible to dispense with pleadings will be seen on a considera-
tion of the practice of the Local Courts. Pleadings are unknown
in the Magistrates? Courts. They are practically abolished by
the new Law Reform Bill now pending before the Victorian
Parliament. By that measure all demurrers, or objections to
pleadings, are prohibited, and an extensive power of amendment
substituted. The Bill in Victoria is supported by the Attorney-
General, Mr. J. W. Stephen, who, apart from his office, is an
acknowledged leader of the bar in .that colony, and by the
Solicitor-General. These considerations meet the objection that
it is impossible to effect the suggested amendment, and show that
practice and authority support the proposed reform. A striking
illustration of the simplicity of the present system of pleading is
afforded by the declaration already described. But another
example can be given, which, because a lawyer is the victim,
may cause the unthinking to laugh, but which will cause the
judicious to grieve. A lawyer in this colony, conceiving he had
a good cause of action against three professional men, commenced
an action against them in the Supreme Court upwards of thirteen
mouths ago. Although the cause of action was simple enough,
the pleas were of a somewhat different character. The conse-
quence was, that the unfortunate plaintiff became immeshed in
a network of intricate pleading technicalities, professionally
known as cross demurrers to declaration and pleas. Whether
the action is still pending and unsettled, or whether the plaintiff
has thus been forced to accept a compromise, we are unable to
state. But, on either assumption, it is a disgraceful outcome of
the so-called simple system of pleading that now constitutes the
practice. What has happened to this plaintiff may happen to
another to-morrow. If the present system of pleading is as
simple as may be alleged, how comes it that such a declaration
as we have described should be found upon the records of the
Supreme Court ? How comes it that a plaintiff seeking to
recover what he conceives to be a just right should find his action
arrested by pleading technicalities, or so involved that he is
obliged to accept a compromise 1 A great outburst of public
indignation would ensue if a criminal were enabled by intricacy
of pleading to baffle the course of justice, and arrest a prosecu-
tion so that no result could be arrived at. Yet this occurred in


the civil case of Wilson and Blackham v. Harrison , commenced
some five or six years ago in our Supreme Court, and which
remains unsettled to this day, save so far as the recent deaths of
the defendant and one of the plaintiffs can he held to have deter-
mined it. Such things are impossible in Local Court procedure.
There, proceedings are conducted by plaint and defence of the
simplest character, and both may be amended the moment a
defect appears. What has proved sufficient for the present
Local Court will undoubtedly prove sufficient even when the
jurisdiction is unlimited. But it will be remembered that to
prevent even the possibility of wrong or inconvenience it is
proposed to reserve power to a Judge to settle issues where
necessary. This will satisfy every object attained by the present
system The opponents of our plan are thus driven to other
objections, if they can be found.
The recommendation for a yearly meeting of the Judges and
Special Magistrates is precisely the species of safeguard that is
necessary when a sweeping measure of reform is effected. Any
defects discovered, any amendments required, will thus be forced
upon the attention of those entrusted with the administration of
the new scheme ; and it will become a duty almost compulsory
upon them in their yearly report to point 'out needed improve-
ments. Should it, for instance, be discovered that technical
pleading is so absolutely necessary as may be alleged, it can be
reintroduced. Should any other step in the new plan require to
he retraced, it can be done in a very short time after the necessity
arises, without waiting, as at present, till family after family is
deliberately ruined, and sufferer after sufferer driven to insolvency
by incomprehensible and unworkable laws. This suggestion of a
yearly meeting cannot prove otherwise than most beneficial,
although it introduces the tentative element, so dear to all patch-
work reformers and conservators of existing abuses.
As a necessary adjunct to the increased jurisdiction of the
Local Courts, certain powers must also be given to them, the
exercise of which is now confined to the Supreme Court. Some
of the most important of these powers were conferred upon the
latter Court by the Acts No. sof 1853 and 24 of 1855-6. More
specific detail will be distasteful to non-professional readers, and
the point is mentioned solely to meet the possibility of a charge
of oversight.
Summarising the plan of reform advocated in these Articles, it
will be found to comprise the following leading features :?To
raise Local Courts, when presided over by professional men, to be
Courts of first instance in all eommon law causes whatever ;
to amend their present constitution in certain respects, and co-
extensively with increased jurisdiction to confer additional


powers; to give an appeal both as to law and fact to the Supreme
Court, which would thus become a Central High Appellate
Court, the Local Courts thus becoming inferior branches of the
higher tribunal; to reserve a right, carefully guarded against
abuse, of removal to the higher Court of causes involving more
than �5OO ; to render uniform the procedure of both the higher
and lower Courts, taking the present practice of the Local Courts
as the model. This plan, while preserving the certainty of law
attained by the present system, promises to suitors the three
essential requisites of simplicity, economy, and dispatch, which
we maintain the public have an absolute right to demand shall
accompany all legal procedure. The other advantages offered,
and the wrongs suffered by the public under the existing practice,
have already incidentally received notice.
In an unwise and abortive attempt to stifle the furnishing of a
return called for by Mr. Carr, which is calculated to afford the
public some instructive information as to the cost and delay at-
tendant upon equitable procedure, the scheme advocated in these
articles was misrepresented, and characterised as ? absurd,? or
? preposterous/? by an eminent legal member of Parliament.
Thanks are due to another legal member who immediately cor-
rected the ?no doubt inadvertent ?error. The use of bare ad-
jectives was doubtless the best reasoning available, but it is
usually thought to denote the absence of sounder argument.
Some ground has been disinterestedly shown to justify calling
the existing delays in the administration of justice ? absurd,? and
the cost of obtaining it ? preposterous.? We, however, absolve
the Bench and the Bar from all blame. A system is attacked,
not individuals. An endeavor, humble and imperfect as it may
be, to ameliorate existing evils, is entitled to kindly consideration
instead of disparaging remarks. These remarks would not have
been noticed were it not that the legal celebrity which has been
so worthily attained by the honorable gentleman might cause
greater weight to be attached to his observations than they
possibly deserve. The combined opinions of the Lord Chancellor,
Sir Roundell Palmer, and other leading English jurists, will be
found to support the views we have so presumptuously expressed,
and will undoubtedly command respectful attention, at all events
from the public, if not from members of Parliament. A succeed-
ing Article will be devoted to an examination of those opinions.
No. VII.
Seldom, if ever, has a more important document been made
public than the second Progress Report of the Commission on
English Judicature. It deals with the subject in a truly Catholic


spirit. It is perhaps impossible to conceive anything more re-
moved from the tinkering ideas with which Reform is too often
approached, and which cause more mischief and misery than the
evils professed to be remedied. Yet it may be questioned
whether fifty persons in the colony are aware of its contents or
even of its existence. It is dated the 3rd July, 1872, It bears
eighteen signatures. Amongst them we find the names of Lord
Chancellor Hatherley, the world renowned Sir Roundell Palmer,
of Phillimore, Willes, Bramwell, Montague Smith, Karslake,
Quain, and others who, though less known to the general public,
stand high in estimation among the professional circles of Eng-
land. That some dissent should exist is not to be wondered at,
but it is surprising that so little divergence should be found.
There are six Commissioners who do not sign the Report. Two
of these allege their reasons to be that they have not regularly
attended the meetings of the Commission. Their non-concurrence,
therefore, is not of much weight. One other prefaces his dissent
by the following enigmatical sentence :?? lam unable to sign
this Report because, although I approve of the greater part of
its recommendations as to changes in the present County Courts,
I am of opinion that effect ought not to be given to such recom-
mendations.? The remaining three express their dissent in very
cautious language. They doubtfully differ from the Report, but
do not positively oppose it. It will thus be seen that the prepon-
derance of opinion is overwhelmingly in favor of the Report,
which may be regarded as almost unanimous.
After pointing out numerous inconsistencies in judicial proce-
dure, the Report proceeds thus :?? Assuming, in accordance with
our previous recommendations, that there will be effected a con-
solidation of all the Superior Courts into a single great Court of
Civil Judicature ?the Supreme or High Court of Justice?which
will contain within itself the elements of all the original juris-
diction now vested in each and all of the Courts to be consoli-
dated, we recommend that the County Courts should be annexed
to and form constituent parts or branches of the proposed High
Court of Justice. This would at once put an end to many of the
anomalies, inequalities, and division of jurisdictions above
adverted to, and to the uncertainty, expense, and delay to which
the litigants are now exposed from Courts acting on conflicting
rules. All original jurisdiction being centred in and exercised
derivatively from the High Court, the extent and mode of its
exercise would simply be a question of distribution. Facilities
would be given for the removal, transfer, and proper trial of
causes and proceedings, due regard being had to the circumstances
of the case and the wishes of the litigants. It would no longer
be necessary to preserve separate forms of procedure, and it
would be possible to provide for the decision of Common Law,


Equity, Admiralty, and Bankruptcy demands by means of one
uniform simple procedure common to all jurisdictions.?
Speaking of County Courts, the Report proceeds thus??We
think that these Courts?as constituent parts or branches of the
High Court of Justice?should, subject to the power of transfer
hereinafter mentioned, have jurisdiction unlimited by the amount
claimed, whatever be the nature of the case, and that thus, if the
parties to the dispute are content that it should be decided in the
County Court, it may be dealt with accordingly. It is true that
the existing limits of the County Courts may be waived by con-
sent, but practically this power is of little use, for it is difficult to
induce disputants to agree upon anything. We propose that
when the amount sought to be recovered exceeds the limit which
we shall suggest, the defendant should be entitled, as if of right,
to transfer the cause into the superior branch of the Court.
When the defence involves a cross claim above the same limit,
the plaintiff should have the like right. There may be cases
below the limit which still ought, from their nature, to be tried
in the superior branch of the Court. In every case, upon the
application of either party there should be a power of transfer by
leave of a Judge of the superior branch of the Court sitting in
Chambers, upon his being satisfied that the case is a proper one
to be so transferred, or that for some special reason it ought to
be heard and disposed of by a superior tribunal.?
As to procedure, the Report says??We recommend that
all cases in the County Courts should be dealt with by one uni-
form procedure, and that the existing distinctions as to Common
Law, Admiralty, and Equity cases should be abolished. In our
former Report we called attention to the inconvenience which
results from these jurisdictions being distinct and separate,
although vested in the same Judge. The proposals we have now
made?that the County Courts should have jurisdiction unlimited
by amount?will abolish the existing restriction by which they
have jurisdiction in equity matters only to a certain amount and
in certain proceedings only, and will extend the jurisdiction in
equity of the County Court to all matters cognisable by the High
Court.?
After recommending that certain existing defects in County
Court procedure should be amended, the abolition of all Local
and Inferior Courts, such as the Lord Mayor?s Court, the Stan-
naries Courts, &c., and that changes should be made gradually
to avoid claims for compensation, the Report goes on ?? As to
procedure, we recommend that it should be of the most simple
and summary description, and similar to that now in use in
County Courts.? After explaining the limits below which the
decision of the Inferior Court should be final, the Report contains
the following recommendation : ??ln all other cases we think


either party should have power to appeal, and that the appeal
should not be limited, as at present, to questions of law.? The
following is the opinion expressed as to the present system of
administering justice by means of sittings held by intermittent
spurts, as it were, during the year, as is now done by the Supreme
Court of this colony : ?? In our former Report we recommended
that the present restriction of time for the fi/isi Pvius sittings in
London and Middlesex should be abolished, and that those sittings
should be held continuously throughout the legal year by as
many Courts as the amount of business to be disposed of may
render necessary. The delay and inconvenience caused by the
present restrictions seriously prejudice the suitors in commercial
cases of importance, and appear to call for prompt redress.?
It is absolutely impossible in the present limited space to do
justice to this admirable and exhaustive Repor-t. It was thought
advisable to be full rather than scanty in making the above
meagre extracts, so as to avoid a charge of garbling. The public
may now, however, in some measure, judge how nearly coincident
with the scheme indicated in these Articles is the Report of the
Judicature Commission. Some of the recommendations made by
us are applicable only to the colony, because the defects are also
purely local. The early meeting of Judges and Special Magis-
trates would be perhaps impossible in England, but is perfectly
practicable in South Australia. The Victorian Law Reform Bill,
already alluded to, contains a similar provision. This, however,*
is merely a detail. Regarding the leading features of our scheme
as summarised in a previous Article, we confidently maintain that
the pledge there given to support it by authority is now more
than fulfilled. We are quite content to leave the issue with the
public. In many respects the Report indicates a far greater
measure of reform than we have ventured to put forth, ?As to
the fusion of Law, Equity, and other jurisdictions, in the extend-
ing this fused jurisdiction to the County Court in all cases what-
ever, whether in Equity, Admiralty, or Bankruptcy, it will be
seen that hitherto we have scarcely if at all avowed any opinion
confining these Articles more especially to the subject of an exten-
sion of the present Common Law jurisdiction of the Local Court
as a first instalment of the immense reform in legal procedure,
which is both absolutely necessary and imminent. The sacred
course of Justice should no longer be traced by ruin and insol-
vency, which too often attend the present system of administration.


APPENDIX.
To the HONORABLE THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY IN PARLIAMENT
ASSEMBLED.
The Petition of the Undersigned Inhabitants of
South Australia
Humbly Sheweth?
That your petitioners humbly submit that the Supreme Court
system is one of centralization, causing suitors and their witnesses
to travel to Adelaide at great expense, for the purpose o�
obtaining a legal decision; while the Local Court system
distributes justice throughout the colony, bringing home to every
man?s door that justice which Magna Charta declares is not to Pe
bought, sold, or delayed.
That the Supreme Court system involves delays extending from
three months to fourteen years, as a reference to the records of
that Court will (your petitioners believe) show ; while under
the Local Court system causes are brought to trial within periods
varying from one week to two months.
That the Supreme Court practice involves intricacy, techni-
and legal refinements, utterly unintelligible save to acute
and trained intellects, necessitating the employment of a solicitors
even in the simplest cases, such as the recovery of a tradesman?
debt or the amount of a bill of exchange; while the Local Court
system is so simple that any man of ordinary intelligence may
conduct any case throughout.
That the Supreme Court system involves costs (to be paid in
most cases by the unsuccessful litigant) varying in amount from
one hundred pounds to thousands of pounds; while the Local
Court system involves an expense to the losing party of from five
shillings to twenty pounds.
That the Supreme Court system is one that professes to decide
causes according to the arbitrary standard of justice, founded upon
the authority?often conflicting?of innumerable decided cases,
extending over centuries of time; while the Local Court system *
decides causes upon the equity, good conscience, and substantial
merits of each particular cause, as apparent at the time of trial.
That equally eminent judges have been, and are governed by
different systems or theories of judicial decision leading to opposite
results?-the one proceeding on technical refinements, the other


on principles of natural justice, common sense, and public policy?
the one deciding almost entirely on general rules and principles,
the other looking to the exceptive circumstances of each case as
much as to general principles, thus leading to inextricable
confusion as regards the application to any particular case of the
rationale of former judicial decisions, frequent litigation,
interminable delays, enormous costs, and the grossest injustice.
That the report of the Judicature Commission in England
recommended an unlimited extension there of the County Court
Jurisdiction, a recommendation which is not earned into effect
by the English Judicature Act. That the English Judicature
Act is so complex in its provisions, that its judicial interpreta-
tion has involved large sums of money and ruinous delays to
litigants, while the procedure under that Act is in most cases as
expensive, tardy, and cumbrous as under the former system,
which is still in a large measure in force and unrepealed, tending
to still greater confusion.
That the evidence before the recent Commission appointed
with regard to Tribunals of Commerce was, in the opinion of
your petitioners, overwhelmingly in favor of the enlargement of
the jurisdiction of the Local Courts of this colony.
That the success of Tribunals of Commerce? on the Continent
of Europe, and the cheapness, simplicity, and speediness, and
consequent popularity, of their decision, is owing to the
influence in those Courts of the lay element, both on the Bench
and as advocates. And that under the Local Court system the
strictness of legal decision is modified to each particular case by
the lay element, both on the Bench and as advocates.
That the Local Court system has in the past given to the people
generally of this colony great satisfaction as regards simplicity,
speed, and economy of procedure; and that in those Courts the
lay element has a larger'share in the administration of justice
than in the Supreme Court, to which circumstance your
petitioners attribute the success and popularity of the Local
Court system.
That your petitioners humbly submit that what is requisite
for true legal reform, is a measure for giving greater effect to the
rational system of judicial decision, as exemplified by the Local
Court system, founded on natural justice, common sense, and
public policy, rather than the false system of technical refine-
ment, and blind adherence to general rules, regardless of the
exceptive circumstances of the case as exemplified by the Supreme
Court System.
That your petitioners for the above reasons believe that any
measure for the reform of legal procedure based upon the English
Judicature Act, or upon any reform of Supreme Court practice,


will be found to be fallacious, unworkable, uninte
injurious.
That your petitioners therefore humbly pray
Honorable House will initiate and pass a measure of La
giving to the Local Courts of the colony a jurisdiction i.
as to amount or subject matter, and conferring upon those
such further and extended powers, similar to those now
possessed by the Supreme Court, as to your Honorable H
shall seem meet.
And your petitioners will ever pray, &c.
FEINTED AT THE ADVERTISES OFFICE, ADELAIDE.
