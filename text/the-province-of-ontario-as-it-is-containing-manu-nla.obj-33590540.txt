Geodes, New York, October 10th, 1876.
J. H. Stone, Esq., Hamilton, Ontario, Canada,
Dear Sir,? The Lanterns arrived all right. On trying them, we find that they are
all you represented them to be, and far superior to the Tubular Lantern now in use in
this country, manufactured by Deitz, of New York, or Denis <6 Wealer, of Chicago,
and recommend them to parties wanting a good Lantern as being the best Tubular
Lantern now in use. Yours truly,
M. BRINTON,
Superintendent Geddes Iron Works.
Lewiston, November 15th, 1876.
J. H. Stone, Esq., Hamilton.
Dear Sir, ?In answer to your enquiry as to how we like your Tubular Lantern, we
would say that it is the best Lantern that we have ever used around onr mill. We find
that your No. C and No. 2 are the best Lanterns in the world, for it seems impossible to
put them out. They will stand when others now in use will go out in anything of a
heavy wind. Our mill is exposed, and the wind can strike it from all points of the com-
pass. We take great pleasure in recommending these Lanterns to the public, as the best
Tubular Lantern now in use. We have had all of the others in our mill, and find them
the only ones to come up to what they were recommended to do.
Yours truly, H. H. WEIGHT & CO.

ONTARIO.
An erroneous impression prevails, not only on the Continent of Europe, but in Great
Britain, that the British North American Colonies recently confederated have been com-
pletely eclipsed in growth of population and material resources by other communities
similarly circumstanced. Nevertheless it can be demonstrated with almost the accuracy
*f a mathematical problem that in their aggregate character these Colonies have main-
tained the highest standard of progress, while in one instance, that of the Province of
Ontario, historical records and census returns can be adduced to prove, beyond contra-
diction, that she has kept pace with the most ambitious and successful of her competitors,
and ean compare favorably with the most prosperous State in the American Union. We
take up the statistical record and find that Ontario has grown from 120,000, in 1821, to
1,620,851, in 1871, thus repeating herself over 13 times in 50 years. And looking into
the future we cannot see any obstacle to prevent her attaining a population of ten million
before the close of another century. The anticipation is not extravagant, because it is

Cartridges creased with this instrument make 20 per cent, better shooting than
turned ones, whilst the recoil is greatly reduced, and the operation of refilling the
exploded shell much facilitated owing to the mouth of the shells being left firm and

The senior partner of this firm began business in this country during the epoch of the
American war, and after a hard fight with inferior manufacturers, succeeded in building
a very extensive traite, in fact to such an extent has he revolutionized the trade in this
country that the importation of manufactured tobacco into the Dominion is now the ex-
ception and not the rule. Among the various brands produced by this firm the follow-
ing are specialities : ?The old man?s favorite,? ?Southern beauty,? ? Little Queen,?
?Tin Tay chewing,? and ? Perfection,? the last named being an original idea in plug
tobacco. It is granulated in the leaf, and then pressed into the plug, and covered with
tin-foil. A knife is not required to prepare this for the pipe. A piece of suitable size is
broken off the plug, and is rubbed into proper shape for filling. Among cigarette
smokers, Perfection is in great demand.
The above specialities are all bright stock for smoking, hut the firm manufacture the
darker glades of chewing tobacco extensively. Old Virginia sun-cured tobacco is exclu-
sively used for the manufacture of chewing, and the care in its manipulation and the
judicious selection of the raw material have done much to establish the proud reputation
which the goods of Messrs. Scales & Co. so deservedly enjoy.
This manufactory has a capacity of 2,000,000 lbs. yearly, and will employ, constantly,
300 hands. The mechanical portion of the factory is a miracle of engineering skill,
prominently in view standing the automatic lump machine, an invention of the senior
partner. Previous to the introduction of this improvement every plug or lump of tobacco
had to be formed by hand, now manual labor is reduced to almost nothing, the lump
being turned out at an astonishing rate of speed, the capacity being about 5.000 lbs. per
diem. It reduces the cost of production from one to one and a half cents per pound, and
produces a superior quality of work. It has met with deserved recognition from the
leading manufactures in the United States, and the inventor, Mr. Joab Scales, was pre-
sented with an address and a handsome testimonial by the Tobacco Associations of Rich-
mond, Va., for his invention. The address is signed by Mr. B. C. Gray, the President
of the Association, Alex. Cameron & Co., James M. Wise, Thos. J. Neal, Walter K.
Martin & Co., and about twenty other firms, the leaders in the tobacco interest in the
world. Another practical evidence of Mr. Scales? genius is to be found in a drying ma-
chine, his own invention, and which produces the most extraordinary results in a very
short time. Already our limits of space are exceeded, and,our article must be brought
to a conclusion. Taken altogether it is a model firm with an ideal manufactory, and
their combined labors have made the name of Joab Scales & Co. one of the moat respect-
ed among the business men of Canada.
WILLIAM BARBER & BROS., GEORGETOWN.
The above firm is one of the oldest establishments for paper making in the Dominion,
having commenced this branch of business in 1854. The paper mills are situated on the
Credit River, on the noth east limit of Georgetown, and occupy about two acres of ground,
giving employment to about 60 hands, and turning out about two and a half tons of paper
a day. There are two mills, both built of stone, one three and the other two stories
high, and the motive power is supplied by a fifty horse power steam engine and four
water wheels, aggregating a force of one hundred and twenty horse power. The firm have
also a wood pulp mill, and a straw pulp mill, and these articles enter largely into their
manufacture of the common kinds of paper, such as manillas, tea, &c. The firm sup-
plies almost all the paper used by the Dominion and Ontario Governments for printing,
and manufacture every kind of paper except writing paper. They have also a large en-
velope factory in Georgetown, where all varieties of styles, sizes, and colors are manufac-
tured, They have very extensive warerooms in Toronto under the management of
Messrs. Barber & Ellis.
ROLPH, SMITH & CO., TORONTO.
This is one of the most complete establishments of its kind in Canada, and was estab-
lished in 1836. They occupy a large brick building, and give employment to between
40 and 50 hands ; their arrangements and machinery for carrying on the business are
complete in every particular, and their rapidly increasing business is the best criterion
of the quality of the work done by them. They do the greater part of the Government
work. They have electrotypes of the United States and Canadian Centennial medals on
hand, and we understand it is their intention to produce the same of the Australian Ex-
hibition medals as soon as they are issued.


THE BRAMPTON AGRICULTURAL WORKS
Was established in 1849, by Mr. John Haggert, the present senior proprietor, under
the name of Haggert Brothers, and to-day they occupy the very front rank amongst
Agricultural Implement manufacturers of the Dominion, in proof of which they point to
the fact of having taken prizes at every Provincial and County Fair for the last 15 years.
Their factory is situated on Main Street, Brampton, the County Town of Peel, Province
of Ontario, and covers nearly 2 acres of ground, the buildings occupying nearly 4 sides
of the square, leaving commodious yard room in the centre. The front or main building,
fer architectural beauty and convenience, is unsurpassed in its class by any in the Do-
minion. It is 4 stories high, built of brick, with cut stone facings, and white brick
arches over the windows. Nearly all their workshops are brick, and their machinery of
the latest and most approved pattern, many of those we saw at work costing, we under-
stand, over one thousand dollars each. Their lumber yard, covering about 5 acres, is
stocked with over one million feet of different kinds of lumber used in their business.
They employ, at present, 140 men. The bulk of their manufactures being Thrashing
Machines, both for horse and steam power, and Reaping and Mowing Machines, of these
they expect to manufacture this year about 150 Thrashing Machines, and upwards of
1 400 Reaping and Mowing Machines. These goods are sent all over the Dominion, from
Quebec to Manitoba. Indeed, they claim to have sent, in 1871, the first Thrashing Ma-
chine the latter Province ever received, costing over $350 for carriage alone, since which
time they have done a large trade with that distant Province. They, last year, exhibit-
ed at the Centennial Exhibition, Philadelphia, one of the most beautifully finished
Threshing Machines that was to be seen at that Great Exhibition, and for which they re-
ceived the Iliijhtxl Award from the International Jury, as well as the Canadian Govern-
ment Medal. This machine was considered of such merit that it was selected by the
Canadian Commissioners for exhibition at Sydney, and we recommend all our Australian
friends to see it.

E. M. WANZER & CO., SEWING MACHINE MANUFACTURERS, HAMILTON,
ONTARIO.
The machine trade of Canada has developed into extraordinary dimensions within the
past fifteen years. Now the manufacture of Sewing Machines has become one of the
most important in the Dominion, gixiug employment to several thousand men, and pro-
fitable iiivestment for some millions of dollars. One of the largest of these is that of R.
M. Wanzer & Co., which received the following unprecedented distinction at the Vienna
Exhibition in 1873, two medals of merit, a distinction not obtained by any other Sewing
Machines at the Exhibition, one grand silver medal for the best family and manufactur-
ing Sewing Machine. His Majesty, the Fmperor of Austria, also confeired upon Mr. R.
M. Wanzer the Iron Cross, and Knighted him with the order of Francis Joseph, which
were the highest honors conferred at the Exhibition. Mr. Wanzer is the only Sewing
Machine manufacturer in Great Britain and its colonies that received these honors. The
factory of R. M. Wanzer & Co. is situated on the corner of King and Catharine Streets,
Hamilton, Ontario, and was established in the year 1860. This is one of the largest sew-
ing machine factories in Canada, and the third largest on the Continent of
America, giving employment to over four hundred hands, and has a capacity
for turning out 1,500 machines a week. Their buildings are four stories in
height, built of brick, at a total cost of about one hundred thousand dollars. They have
been awarded medals, diplomas, honors, and prizes at all European Exhibitions ; at
Vienna, Austria, royal diploma in 1864 ; at the National Exhibition of the British Isles,
held in Dublin, first prize medal in 1566 ; at the British Exhibition held at Dudley and
York two first prize medals in 1867 ; in the same year at the Great World?s Exhibition
held in Paris, France, they wereawarded the first andhighestprize medal for family sewing
machines among eighty seven competitors ; at Manchester and Cheltenham, England,
two first prize medals in 1868 ; Sydney, Australia, gold medal, 1871 ; Lima, Peru, gold
medal in 1872 ; Moscow, Russia, gold medal in 1872 ; Vienna three medals ; at the
Santiago (Chi i) World?s Fair, first medal in 1876 ; and they also received the only gold
medal at the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia. Their agents in Sydney are Gibbs,
Sbellard & Co.

WATERFORD AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT WORKS.
These works were established in 1844, by Jas. L. Green. As is customary with foundries
and machine shops in new countries, it embraced in its manufactures a large variety of
goods, ploughs, harrows, rollers, cutting boxes, &c., as well as engines, shingle machines,
and drag saws. But of late years the Waterford shops have been gradually decreasing
the variety of its manufactures until, at the present time, it is making a speciality of the
? Royce Reaper,? although orders for other kinds of its manufactures are received and
refused. The present proprietors, Messrs. Green Bro. & Co., introduced the Royce
Reaper into Canada, making some 25 Reapers for the first year, 1875, and 300 for the
season of 1876 At present the capacity of the Waterford shops is from 1,500 to 2,000
Reapers and Mowers, which can easily be increased to two or three times this capacity.

CANADA SEWING MACHINE COMPANY, HAMILTON.
Among the leading manufacturing establishments of Canada, the Canada Sewing Ma-
chine Company, (limited), of Hamilton, Ontario, manufacturers of the celebrated ? Web-
ster? and ? Empress of India ? Sewing Machines, stands out pre eminently as an enter
prising Compaqy. For a long while they have been running their extensive works to
their full capacity, full handed, to supply their rapidly increasing Foreign demand, and,
owing to tms, they were unable to give the time necessary to the preparation and ex-
hibition of their machines at the Centennial Exposition at Philadelphia. Of course in
Canada the name of the Websterhas become an household word, because that machiueis the
household companion, almost universal, and their increasing sales in England, Germanv,
Belgium, and Spain bid fair to make it become equally as popular in Europe as it is in
America to-day. Much satisfaction is felt in the Dominion that this enterprising Com-
pany is about to introduce their machines in Australia, and have sent out representative
samples of their work to the Exhibition in Sydney, and amongst other machines they
have shipped there, they have included the new hand machine the ? Empress of India,?
which has received such high praise in Europe, and for which this Company are at the
present time filling extensive orders.

THE WENTWORTH ENGINE & IMPLEMENT COMPANY, HAMILTON, CAN.,
la one of the moat extenaive manufacturing establiahments in Canada, and ia fitted with
the ueweat and moat complete machinery and tools anywhere in the Dominion. The
Company ia therefore enabled to undertake and turn out work of a very superior quality,
at rates below that usually charged by similar factories. The firm was originally found-
ed by Mr. F. G. Beckett, about twenty years ago, who introduced the moat improved
latest English inventions, ever since which time it has increased in popularity, and stands
now without a rival in the manufacture of Steam Engines and Boilers, the Beckett En-
gine having in every instance stood the teat of twenty years hard wear and tear, and there
are now several thousands of them at work all over the country. Some time since the
manufacture of Agricultural Implements was added to the business by combining with a
well-known established firm, and the style or name was then changed, as above, to the
? Wentworth Engine and Implement Company.? It is unnecessary, perhaps, to add
that all orders intrusted to this Company will be carefully and faithfully carried out, the
officers being men of high standing and known ability, and it is hoped that they may
do a large trade with the Australian public.

RILEY & MAY?S FACTORY, TORONTO.
In October last Messrs. Riley & May occupied their new building, No. 81 Adelald*
Street West, a brief description of which, and the various operations to be carried on
therein, will doubtless be of interest. The factory is a new brick building, three stories
in height, with a frontage of 25 feet and a depth of 70. There is also a wing partly in
the rear and partly to the west two stories in height, and measuring 66 x 25. The first
floor of the main building is devoted to the woodwork of the tables and cues. The slats
used comes from Vermont. At one time it was impor ted from Wales, and there is reason
to believe there is ample supply in Canada if the quarries were worked. In ouc end of
the buihli"g is the en ino, which is of 20-horse power, fitted up in the very beat manner,
and furnished with one of Hodgins? condensing heaters. The second flat of the building
is devoted to wo idwork and used for drying purposes. All the tables are hard polished,
receiving what is known as the piano finish. The time required for the completion of a
table averages from lire to six mouths, by far the greater portion of which is con.-umed
in giving the roper finish. The woods chiefly used are rosewood, satin wood, and Hun-
garian a-h. A large stock of, all billiard goods is always kept ou hand. Messrs. Riley
& May employ about twenty hands, and have now the capacity for turning out auoiit 300
tables per annum. They have lately commenced the manufacture of bevelled
which a e a great improvement in convenience as well as appearance on the old box-
shaped style. The firm have been engaged in the bu dues" since 1835, and the continual-
ly increasing demands upon them necessitated the erection of their present well-arranged
and commodious factory.
GUELPH SEWING MACHINE CO.

beauty of their work is something wonderful. They usually employ about one hundred
and fifty hands capable of turning out about two hundred machines weekly, and as a sore
indication of their success, have been enabled to keep their manufactory running steadily
through the dull times of the past two years. We were glad to learn fdiat their fuoces*
at the Centennial Exhibition in both International and Canadian awards sustains their
previous reputation, and will assist in bringing into more general notice this pro'peron*
and beneficial industry.

R. MALCOM, SADDLER, &c., TORONTO.
One of the most successful exhibits at the Centennial were the harness and mail bags
shown by the above named gentleman. The Scotch Canadian drag harness was pro-
nounced by the English Judges to ha superior to any thing of the kind ever seen in the
?Id country. The ten saddles were reported as unexcelled by anything on exhibition.
But special reference was made to the mail bags shown there, the peculiarity of which
was a patent fastening which entirely dispenses with padlocks, twine, and sealing wax,
and furnishes a certain means of detecting dishonest clerks or carriers who make a prac-
tice of tampering with the ordinary locks. Over six thousand of these hags are in daily
use in the Dominion of Canada P. 0. Department, and found reliable, since 1869. These
bags have been in use in New York City between the General Office and the 8 stations
lor all registered matter ever since August 1870, and the Supeiintendent, Cbas. Forres-
ter, Jr., informs us that he has yet to record the first registered letter lost from them.
They are much cheaper and more durable than when fastened with twine and wax ; in
the former case a set of bags were used up in five months, while the seal lock bags ars
still geod after a constant use of over six years. They are also in use in Chicago between
the General P. 0. and the 6 stations ; and on the Michigan Central R R. between De-
troit and Chicago. Wells, Fargo <fe Co., Express Agents, have bad one hundred of them
in use between New York and San Francisco for over six years, to their entire satisfac-
tion. Samples of these patent seal lock bags are now on exhibition at the New South
Wales Australian Exhibition. Samples and prices free on application.

DUNDAS COTTON MILLS CO., HAMILTON.
The Dnndas Cotton Mills began in 1859, being the first Cotton Mills started in Cana-
da, and have been gradually increased in extent and capacity until they now amount t*
15,000 spindles, with 308 looms, and employ over 300 operatives. The production
amounts to about 2,000,000 yards of cloth, annually, and the total weight turned out
during the same time is about 1,000,000 lbs. The Mills are advantageously situated in
the Town of Dundas, on the main line of the Great Western Railway, four miles from
the City of Hamilton, thus affording good facilities for obtaining all the necessary sup-
plies, and distributing the goods produced. The goods are favorably known all over
Canada, and have entirely taken the place of English cottons, which are not now import

VailiS Biokley. Some fourteen years since this firm (t�en known as Sanford & Mclnnee)
sommence I tne manufacture of ready-made clothing in Hamilton. At that time they
employe 1 three cutters and a sutfi dent number of other empljvees to keep them busy.
The idea with which the firm co mmenced business was that of raising the standard of
ready-ma le clothing, so as to in ike it neatly or quite equal to custom-w >rk, and in this
they have been decidedly sucoess'ul, as a glance at their stock will convince the most
sasual observer. Fifteen years ag > ready made overcoats were wholesale at from $2.60
to $5 ; now few overcoats are mi inf icturcd for loss than $3. and many bring as much
as $l5 wholesale. Undercoats then ranged from $3 to $5 : now they bring from $4 ts
$l2. Tweed pa ts at that time brought from $1 50 to �2.50 ; now the prices range from
$1.75 to �7. This difference, it must be remembered, is not owing to any fluctuation in
the values of material or labor, but almost entirely to improvement in the quality of ths
articles mentioned. Ready-made clothing can now he purchased that in cut, finish, or
quality of fibrin, is in no way inferior to ordered work. In his efforts to bring about this
revolution in the trade, Mr. Bin lford found it necessary to employ first class workmen
in almost every department, and to use the best materials in the market. A foreman
from New York was engaged at a saliry of $4,000 per annum, and other important posi
tions in the establishment were entrusted only to experienced first-class workmen.
HOW THK GOODS ARK MADE UR.
A foreman in the cloth and trimmings room on the ground floor selects a certain pies*
?f cloth to he manufactured into coats, for instance. He then selects the trimmings
that he considers most suitable, laying aside the necessary quantities, canvas, body
lining, sleeve lining, buttons, thread, binding, velvet for collars if required, material for
pockets, wadding, interlining, and everything in the shape of material that may be neces-
sary, an I putting the lot on the ? hoist,? despatches them to the foreman of the cutters' 1
room in the top storey. Here the work is cut out to suit different sizes, in the latest
styles ; ami as each coat is cut and the necessary trimmings apportioned to it, it is wrap-
ped up in a parcel and given out at the counter to he finished. Some idea of
THE EXTENT OF THE BUSINESS DONE
here may be obtained from the fact that the firm g?vea employment to over 1 000 people,
and employs a cash capital in the business of over $500,000. Evcy town and village of
any importance in the Dominion, from British Columbia to Prince Edward Island, is
visited at least twice a year by a traveller from this firm. The establishment gives era-
ploym-nt to no less than sixteen commercial travellers, and the cost of tbeir service last
year was no less than $34,000, The stock no vin store?although this is the intermediate
season? mounts to over $350 000. Of ths fabrics manufactured about forty per cent,
are Canadian and the rest English.
THE TORONTO BRANCH,
which has been recently establ shed on Colborne street at the bead of Scott street, ts
already doing a prosperous business. The premises, which were lately occupied by
Tuttle, Dite & Rodden, are very pleasantly situated, roomy and commodious. The
stock, though of course not as heavy as that in the Hamilton house, is large, and com-
prises more nr less of every line t� be found there. The Toronto business has made' an
excellent beginning, and promises extremely well.

THE MOOREHEAD MANUFACTURING ?O.
London, ? the Forest City,? boasts mauy fine buildings and prominent industries, but
she has no place of which she ought to feel more justly proud than the Moorebead manu-
facturing Company, a large four storey brick building, two hundred feet long, extending
from 184 ro 198 King street, it is a credit to the proprietors, and an ornament to the
City. The factory was established in 1855, and now gives constant employment to over
two hundred men ; and being so thoroughly furnished with all necessary machinery, it
justly ra"ks amongst the most complete furniture fac'ories in the west, and their goods
are widely spreid over the whole Dominion. The wareroom on King street has a front-
age of seventy-five feet by a depth of fifty, the finishing room is sixty feet by seventy,
all these buildings are four stories high. The upholstering room is two stories high,
built of brick, one hundred and fifty long by thirty wi i� ; the engine room and planing
mill is of the same height, built of brick, and fifty five feet by forty, and the drvina kiln,
also built of brick, and two stories high, is forty feet by filty. Mr. George Moorehead,
President of the Company, has literally grown up in the business, entering it as a boy,
and by pains and industry working the Company up to its present position. The Company
also keep a very large stock of carpets, curtains, ccnices, &c.. so that they can take an
empty house and furnish it complete in a manner that few manufacturers in Americ < can
equal and none excel. Their exhibit at the Sydney Exhibition can be seen in the Cana-
dian Department and is well worth inspection.

AYR AGRICULTURAL WORKS, AYR.
These works were established in 1817, by Mr. John Watson, its present enterprising
proprietor. The reputation that the works now enjoy is world wide, and the name of
Watson is well known throughout Canada, and its manufactures are to be found in every
quarter of the civilized globe. At the late Centennial Exhibition these works carried off
the highest award for agricultural machinery, viz. : The only gold medal offered, and a
bronze medal, together with a special report of the chief merits of the exhibit. The
buildings are of stone aud wood, fully equipped with all necessary machinery driven by
turbine wheels. Ayr is a station on the Credit Valley Railway.

ABELL S WOODBRIGE AGRICULTURAL WORKS.
These works are amongst the largest of the kind in the Dominion. They cover an
area of 2� acres. There are two ranges of buildings, the main building being 200 feet
long and three stories high, containing the offices, machine shop, wood work shop and
pattern room. The other range of building contains the foundry, 65 x 36 feet, and the
paint shop on a second flat. Between three and four hundred tons of pig iron are used
annually in the works, besides 125 tons of wrought iron, and a large quantity of scrap
iron ; 225 tons of coal are also yearly consumed. In the wood work 100,000 feet of lum-
ber are annually made use of, ami there is constantly kept on hand a three years supply
of lumber, or 300,000 feet to insure it being well seasoned and dry before using. From.
120 to 150 men are constantly employed. All kinds of agricultural implements are manu-
factured, and also mill machinery of every description, besides engines, boilers, &o.
Complete saw mills are made up and all requisites provided, including frame of building,
tawing machines, engines, boilers, and gearing of every kind. Goods are sent from this
establishment to all parts of the Dominion. Mowing and sawing machines have also
been sent from here to England. His shipment to the Sydney Exhibition is one of the
largest, and his turbine water wheel deserves special attention.

This is ons of tbe largest and most enterprising houses in their line in Canada. Tha
business was founded by Mr. H. A. Nelson in Montreal in 1840, where they occupy a
handsome structure 120 feet deep by 66 feet wide, 5 stories high, besides a basement,
containing all the newest and most approved machinery, and employing at present 50
hands. Their business grew so large that in 1868 they opened a branch establishment in
Toronto which is a handsome white biick building containing 4 stories and a basement, it
is 150 feet deep by 33 feet wide, and to it is added a wing 50 x3O feet. They employ in
Toronto between 40 and 50 bauds, and do a very extensive trade. The writer, when
going through the buildings, was surprised and very much edified by the extent and
variety of their very large stock, and the completeness of arrangements both in the fac-
tory and warerooms. An exhibit of some of their goods can be seen at the Canadian De-
partment of tbe Sydney exhibition which we feel sure will well reward an inspection, and
we feel confident that any business transactions with this firm will receive careful atten-
tion and be satisfactory.

MoMURRAY & FULLER, MANUF XCTURERS OF WOODEN WARE, &c.,
TORONTO.
These large works are situated at the Central Prison in Toronto, Ontario. Canada, and
were built by the Ontario Government, at an expense of over $400,000. The shops are
moat complete in every respect, are headed by steam, and have in use the newest and
moat approved labor saving machinery selected from various manufactories. The prison
labor ia leased by the Government to the C. C. and Mftg Co., and when the works are
completed they will employ about 250 men. We can safely recommend their manufac-
tures lor the following reasons :
Ist.?Superior manufacture of all their wooden ware, in consequence of its thorough
desiccation by means of a steam kiln-drying process at 190� Far. previous to its manufac-
ture.
2od,?Their machinery is of the newest, and most improved description, and has been
specially selected from the best makers, both as regards economy and strength.
3rd,?Holding, as they do, valuable concessions from the Government for the utiliza-
tion of prison labor, at a nominal cost per diem, they enabled to produce large quan-
tities t f specialities at prices which will give a better value to the trade, and defy com-
petition.
The works are connected by rail wi*h all lin*s coming into the City, and have about 3
miles of tracks in their yard for receiving lumber, coal. &c., and shipping m nu actured
goods, so that they can pack car b�ad lots in their works for shipment direct via New
York. Montreal, or Halifax. Their cedar ware is manufac ured expressly for hot
?climates.
SESSIONS, COOPER, & SMITH, MANUFACTURERS OF BOOTS AND SHOES,
TORONTO. CANADA.
This business was commenced over twenty years ago, and has kept, on steadily in-
creasing in volume, until it now stands the acknowledged head of the trade in the Do
minion. The business vaa ca-ried on for a number of years on Wellington Street, but a
few year* ago it was found impossible to meet the demands of the trade without increas-
ing the facilities for manufactu ing, a >d a building was erected on Front Street, specially
designed for that purpose. The building is 80 feet front bv 180 feet in depth, and five
stories high. The cellar is used as a store-room for leather, and the heavier grade of
boots, it also contains the engine that runs the machinery, the boiler being in a separate
building. The first floor is used as a warehouse, sample rooms and offices, the factory
occupying all the rest of the building. The factory contains all the latest and most im-
proved machinery for economising labor, and improving the quality of the goods. It is
now one of the largest of the kind in America, giving employment to over 500 hands,
and turning out upwards of half ami lion of pairs annually. V very discripHon and style
of boots and shoes are manufactured bv the firm, from the infant?s shoe to the heavy
atoga boot, and their goods have an enviable popularity in the Dominion. In addition to
their own factory they make extensive contracts with the smaller ma"nfactnrers for
special lines during the seasons. The bulk of their business is done in Ontario, but. since
the Confederation of the Provinces the hrnse has worked up an extensive and rapidly in-
creasing trade with the lower Province*. Manitoba, and British Columbia, and export
largely bevond the boundaries of the Dominion. Their agent, Mr. Thos. Oliver, is now
in Australia, for the first time, with sample* of their goods, and will call on the leading
with a view of opening up a trade with that country.
HAMILTON AGRICULTURAL WORKS, HAMILTON, ONTARIO, CANADA.
In the year 1836 the firm of McQ oesten <fe Co. established, in a very small way. these
works which are now so justly celebrated all over Cmada. Starring down upon the
lowest round of the mercantile ladder of fame, they have cbmbed clear to the topmost,
achieving what no other agricultural firm has done in the Dominion ?a name and place
�� almost every clime. In the year 1854 the present extensive buildings were erected by


L. I). Sawyer <fe Co., occupying nearly five acres of ground in the north-east part of the
City. The principal buildings are of stone. The machine shop is a building 80 feet by
90 feet, and fitted up with the latest improved machinery, all peculiarly adapted for the
manufacture of their machines. The moulding shop, or foundry, is nearly as large, 'ihe
carpenter shop is a stupendous building 90 feet by 90 feet; this, with the blacksmith
shop, brick paillt shop, storerooms, and warehouses, all go to prove our assertion that
this is truly the most extensive works of the kind in the Dominion of Canada. There is
in constant employment 150 to 200 workmen, some of them having seen twenty years
cr more of service with the firm, and it is a note-worthy fact that in all of the years of
its existence work has not been suspended, except for annual repairs. A steady, pro-
gressive growth has been maintained, and by the uniform excellence of manufacture,
and liberal dealings with patrons and agents, the demand for their productions has
steadily increased until there is now hardly a portion of the Dominion in which their
machines may not be found in use. Another and most convincing proof of the high
standard of this firm is that at the Great Centennial World?s Fair, held at Philadelphia,
U. S., the past season, they obtained the only prize medal given by the United States for
mcwers ar d reapers to any firm outside of their domains. They also obtained the silver
medal of Canada, which was the only prize given by the Dominion for mowers and reap-
ers. Messrs. Henry P. Welsh & Co., 172 Queen St., Melbourne, and at Sydney, 43 Pitt
St., have been appointed as agents for the sale of the machines manufactured by L. D.
Sawyer & Co., and we bespeak for them a large and flourishing trade throughout Aus-
tralia.
JOHN RITCHIE & SON, TORONTO.
This firm is composed of John Ritchie, sr., and John Ritchie, jr., and was founded in
the year 1857 by the senior, who carried on business at the corner of Frederick and King
Streets until 1861, when, finding that larger premises were required for the increasing
business, he removed to 192 King Street, a very large building containing three stories
and a basement, and to still further increase facilities a steam engine was added. In
1870 the junior member of the firm was admitted as a partner. It is now one of the
largest establishments of the kind in the Dominion employing, when in full blast, about
75 hands, and we understand it is the intention of the firm to still further extend their
premises when time will permit. This is one of the most complete factories for turning
out all kinds of brass work, having all the most modern tools and machinery, add always
adding thereto, so that they are in a position to enter into competition with any market
for style, finish, workmanship, and price. We are glad to note that they have been award-
ed the International award and medal from the Centennial Commissioners, at Philadel-
phia, (1876). and also the only medal awarded by the British judges for the Canadian
Department at the same Exhibition. And for the last Provincial Exhibition we notice
that they have just received the diploma for the best assortment of globe and check
valves. The fodowing are among the principle articles of their manufacture : For gas?
Coronas, chancel, pulpit, and pillar lights. For churches and halls?Chandeliers, pen-
dants, brackets, &c. For houses and stores ?All kinds of joints and fittings for gas fit-
ting. For water?All kinds of valve and pan water closets and fittings, straight and
nose ground plug (bib) cocks ; straight and nose compression cocks ; valves and fittings
for baths, wash basins, hydrants, slop sinks, and all kinds of plumber?s supplies. For
steam ?All kinds of globe, ange, check, safety, vacuum valves, steam gauges, water
gauges, gauge cocks, stop cocks, and all kinds of engineer?s and machinist's supplies.
They have also five different patterns of bank and office railways for counters, and have
facilities for making to any pattern nr size required on submitting a sketch. We can
fully recommend them as competent to execute any orders entrusted to them with promp-
titude and at low figures. They alse deal in iron and lead pipe, iron fittings, cooking
ranges, and keep in stock all articles required by plumbers, gas, and steam litters, en-
gineers, and machinists. Price list and discounts furnished on application.
E. &C. GURNEY, HAMILTON, ONTARIO. CANADA. MANUFACTURERS OF
STOVES AND HOLLOW WARE.
The members of this firm who established a pioneer stove and hollow ware manufactory
at Hamilton, Out., in 1813. have achieved a success at once creditable to their enterprise
and ability, and indicative of the growth and resources of the Dominion. They carry
on two mammoth manufactories, one at Hamilton, and the other at Toronto, and al-
though these remarks were written after an inspection of the Hamilton establishment, it
must be understood that they apply with equal accuracy to the one situated in the capital


of the Province, indeed, in architectural design and finish the Toronto establishment is
the superior structure, being perhaps the finest pile devoted to manufacturing purposes
in the Province. The Hamilton establishment is, nevertheless, handsome and commo-
dious, like the one in Toronto, it is 20U x 300 feet, the wareroom alone measuring 68 x
70. In Hamilton the Messrs. Gurney employ 175 hands, and in Toronto a similar num-
ber, and they melt annually in their two foundries the enormous quantity of 2 800 tons
of pig iron. To sustain this large business, over half a million of dollars of capital is in-
vested, and their annual disbursements for lalor. material, and the like, figure largely in
the transactions of the commercial community. A fifty-horse power engine is required to
keep in motion the busy wheels of this industry, in each of their manufactories, and they
occupy a proud position as the leading stove and hollow ware manufacturers of the Do-
minion, investing as tiny do more capital and doing more business than any three similar
firms in the country, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, producing the greatest and best
variety of goods, and supplying the largest demand, as is attested by the extent of their
business connections, the amount of their receipts, ana their universal success in carrying
off p?izes wherever they have exhibited. Nor has the keen but unsuccessful competition
which they have had to encounter been from Canadian manufacturers alone ; since 1843
they have met the largest firms doing business in the United States upon the open Cana-
dian market, and have met them successfully. There are no shrewder, more energetic,
or more Successful manufacturers in the world than those of the Great Republic, and the
ability of the Messrs. Gurney to hold their o�n against these, sufficiently demonstrates
all that need bo claimed for them and their business. These brief and imperfect notes
cannot convey to the reader any accurate conception of the fiant strides which hav*
been made in Canada in the manufacture of every description of hollow ware, and of heat-
ing apparatus lince the Messrs Gurney first gave to the business the impetus under
which it still moves, but they may give him some idea of the men who have made their
names household voids throughout the land, and who have helped to build up the two
leading cities of the premier Province of Canada. The broad and firm basis upon which
their business now rests, enadles them to compete with all comers from all quarters, both
in price and quality, in the markets of either their own or other countries.
H. T. SMITH, MANUFACTURER OF SODA WATER MACHINES & FOUNTAINS.
One of the most prominent features ot the Canadian Department at the late Philadel-
phia Exhibition was the soda water stand of the above well known inventor who occu-
pies no mean place among the list of industries in the City of Toronto. The factory is a
hand nine brick building on Elizabeth Street, and gives employment to about 75 hands.
The business was established in 1857.
Among the many superior advantages of his improved soda water machine are :
Ist. Uniformity of Quality. ?By steadily woi king the pump the quality of the soda
water can be kept perfectly regular and even, from start to finish, whereas by the Am-
erican self-acting machine, nothing approaching to regularity is attainable, the quality
varying constantly, according to the quantity in the receiver.
2nd Various Grades Producible ?H. T. Smith?s machine enables the manufacturer
to produce any quality that may be desired, as web as to keep it uniform. From the
weakest to the most highly charged, each can be made with equal facility.
3rd. Cheapness and Rapidity. ?This machine surpasses all others in the quantity
capable of being turned rut, and in economy of expense attending the same. By having
two bottling benches, 500 dozen may he bottled daily, and at the lowest calculation it
will make twice as much as the self acting machine?cost and quality being the same.
4th. Security from Explosion, etc. ?The pump is furnished with an air chamber and
safety-valve, which causes it to work smoothly over the centre and avoid all jerkiness,
at the same time forming a perfect safe-guard against explosion.
His fountains will well bear comparison with any of the largest and most celebrated
American makers, and he deserves the utmost credit for bis happy combination of ele
gance of design with excellence of manufacture, not to mention the very important fact
that his apparatus is sold at reasonable prices.
No inferior material, and none but the best workmanship will be found to enter into
their composition ; the utmost regard is paid to the purity of the beverages to be pro-
duced, and in all except the extremely cheap patterns, the coolers are lined with block
tin and the syrup jars made of enameled porcelain, a great improvement over the metal
ones generally used.
An important feature, and one peculiar to the ? Frigid,? is the manner ia which the
coolers are constructed ; by means of a partition running longitudinally through the
centre, the soda water has to traverse the entire length of the coolers twiee over, and


thus travel double the ordinary distance through the ice. In this way an ice-cold bever-
age is always obtainable, no matter bow continuously it may be drawn, ami a steady and
even flow is secured, in contrast to the jerky aud irregular discharges so commonly char-
acteristic of fountains by other makers.
Several new designs have recently been brought nut, as the ?Renaissance ? and the
? North Star,? to which the attention of the trade isiuvited, aud which will be found
to be well worthy of inspection.
Mr. Smith is, himself, at the Sydney Exhibition, and can be seen at the Canadian De-
partment. He is also acting as agent for several of the exhibitors.

A SHORT SERMOX FOR BUSINESS MEN.
TEXT?? A SCREW 1.0 )SE SOMEWHERE.?
There is a large class of persons in business in every country who have little difficulty
in making money, but who never become any richer, and not unfrequontly end by be-
coming insolvents. This particular cUssare generally well-behaved members of society,
and in most case- indust>ious, and stand well in their respective localities. They appear
to make good wages, or do a flourishing hns'ness. and are the persons, one would sup-
pose. who would readily accumulate wealth. But they don?t succeed, and the old siw,
there is ? a screw loose somewhere," reveals the why and wherefore of their failure.
The ? screw loose somewhere,? with a large proportion of the individuals referred to, is
living too fast. Their business is often exeelleot?they are considered well-to-do in the
world, and handle a good deal of money; but they spend as fast as they make. If they
Blake more, they spend more ; hut in any event they never accumulate. By efforts to
maintain a certain position in society, by indulging in luxuries here, and a little more
extravagance there, the fruits of their labor ae frittered frivolously away. Frequently
these persons believe themselves to he making money ; but they keep no systematic re-
cord of their expenditure, either household or personal. Local bills arc seldom paid


promptly, or closely scanned, and they have no means of knowing correctly, nor do they
ever trouble themselves to enquire how much they really do rpend unnecessarily in the
Bourse of a year. In this way thousands drift on uutil they aie rudely awakened from
their dream to find that the wealth they might have made, and believed they were ac-
?umulating, hao slipped away through leaks as fast as it was made.
Many business men who have prematurely undertaken to build tine residences, or made
?ther rash investments in real estate, have found, before they went far, that there was
?a screw loose somewhere.? Fine r. sidenoes are desirable, real estate is often profit-
able, but neither are desirable or profitable to those who cannot spare the capital to in-
vest in them. How often is it the case, however tnat the particular class to which refer-
ence is made, commence to built costly private residences, invest in real estate, or set up
the family carriage ? Their business, it m�y be, is doing well, but its profits are drawn
upon too lirgely, hr investment of a permanent and duub ful character, and they go on
from year to year, foolishly squandering with one hand what tiny make with the other.
The long-winded credit system is another rook upon wnich many a good business,
with an easy-going, Ire spending manager is stranded. This evil is double-beaded, for
it injures not only I he seller, but the customer ; the debtor as well as the creditor. Those
who want credit, a moat invariably pay exhorbitant prices for what they pun base. They
are frequently mulcted in heavy interest, and their indebtedness has, consequently,
small chance of being wiped out. On the other hand the merchant or trader who gives
long credit and fails to make his collections promptly, cannot purchase advantageously,
and similar loss to that suffered by his customer is enta Jed hy himself when purchasing
from the wholesale dealer. In s ores of ways the evils of extended credit are felt by
the country ; and it is not too much to say that thousands in Canada would soon be-
come rich, but for the ha 1 debts and other losses arising from tins cause. All the profits
which these persons think they are making, really leak through their ledger, and if they
long continue to follow the baneful system, they soon find there is ? a screw loose some-
where.? wb eh threatens, if it does not actually involve them in ruin.
