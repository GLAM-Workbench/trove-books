PREFACE
These verses were sent to me by my daughter without
any thought of their publication, but thinking a little
booklet would be a pleasing souvenir for her, and that her
friends would much appreciate a copy, I have had them
printed.

A WANDERER’S RHYMES
On Board the
“Mooltan”
RAPID recovery of Helen of Troy;
She was flirting downstairs with a naughty boy;
Her face was illumined and sparkling with joy,
Her manner was charming and frightfully coy !
There was a young person called Man,
Who was known from Beersheba to Dan;
She came from an isle
Where they dressed in a smile,
Till she sailed away on the “Mooltan.”
There was a young person called Nellie,
Who melted away to a jelly;
When she went down to bed
She drank white wine and red —
But she never would tell Miss Pengelly !


A Wanderer’s Rhymes
On Board the “China”
MEANDERING MEMORIES
ONE day upon the “China”,
When everybody snored,
And even our dear Nellie
Was really very bored
Because the wretched woman
Who attended at her bed
Would only give her strong advice
Instead of bits of bread.
She said: “The deck is charming,
The day so very fine,
’Tis a shame to lie upon your bed
Like clothes upon the line.”
But Nellie, so strong minded,
Her warning would not take,
She lay there in her glory
And revelled in headache.
At length when they were nestled
In the music room so neat,
Their thoughts would often wander
To their dear friends so sweet
Whom they’d met upon the “Mooltan”
On that ne’er-forgotten trip
When Nellie was so hungry
She swallowed all the ship.
“Let’s see —why there was Watty,
And Mrs. Thompson too;
Do you remember Lady Betty P
She looked so sweet in blue;
And Lady Jane, all bubble,
With her little curl so coy;
And also funny Billie Sykes
(He was a naughty boy!).


The Reverend Mr. Hoysted,
Who talked photography
And int’resting cathedrals
With fluent orat’ry;
And then dear Mrs. Hoysted,
Whom everyone adored,
Was really quite the favourite
Of all the folk on hoard.
Then dear old Miss Pengelly,
With her startling autumn tints,
Who always looked so natty
Although she dressed in prints.
Of course, there was dear “Bumshus
And many others too
Whose names we will not mention
For fear of tiring you.
And yet it seems a pity
Not to mention Brothers Stark,
Especially the elder,
Who was such a giddy spark;
Our mutual friend Sparghette,
A clever little lad,
Who strutted up and down the deck
Showing every inch he had.
They could hut feel a little sad
Because too well they knew
’T was really most unlikely
Their friendship they’d renew;
But looking down the ages
Of past and all to he,
They felt they’d ne’er regret it,
’T was a happy memory.


WHILE THE BOAT ROLLS ON
TN a contemplative fashion
We sat silent and alone,
Thinking mostly of our washing,
Which was dashed against the stone
By the natives of the island
Where the crocodiles disport,
While the food is very oily,
And the natives dress in naught.
And so our thoughts went wand’ring
Across the watTy space,
Till they lit upon dear Jumbo
At his Porcupiney Chase,
Where, surrounded by the monkey
And all the jungle folk,
He sat within his bungalow
And had his lonely smoke.
Perhaps his thoughts, too, wandered
To the days that have gone by,
When the little Streak and Nellie
Came to brighten all his day
With their frolicking and chatter,
Making life so very gay
That the world seems very empty
Now they both have sailed away.
But no doubt dear Sue and Bembo,
With their caresses true,
Will chase away his sorrow,
And his fond hopes renew;
Until a little later,
When the evening shadows fall,
He ’d tumble over backwards
And knock his head against the wall.


HOW COULD HE?
THEY stood together hand in hand
Upon the China deck,
His arms enclosed her dainty waist,
Hers were around his neck.
And gazing fondly in her eyes
Of liquid hluey-grey,
He sent a message through their depths.
The words he could not say.
Within his strong, brown, manly hands
He held one soft and white,
For not a soul was there to see
Except the pale moonlight.
She was really quite attractive,
The night called for romance,
It certainly was folly,
But who could miss the chance ?
The silence broke, and whispers
Caressing might be heard,
But there was no one listening
To catch the tender word.
Her lips were slightly parted,
Her cheeks were flushed quite red;
She lifted up her dainty hand
And smacked him on the head!


A Wanderer’s Rhymes
TO A SEA-GULL
away,
* * Sweet sea-gull of grey ?
How can you roam
So far from your home ?
Have you no nest
Where you can seek rest P
Is there no young brood
Waiting there for its food P
You must cease your flight
Through the long night,
And float fast asleep
On the breast of the deep.
Have you no fear
With nothing else near ?
I watch as you fly
Low and then high,
You poise on the wing,
Or sail round in a ring,
You hang still for a moment,
Then shoot like a comet;
Such power and such skill
You display at your will.
You never seem faint
Hor make a complaint,
Just follow the ship
On her long plodding trip.
THE SEA
F LOVE to ride
By the rising tide,
With the great sea stretching far and
And all is fair and calm;
Succeeding wavelets follow each,
Creeping, creeping up the beach,
Trying hard the land to reach,
Yet doing nothing harm.
wide,


On the Continent
CANNES
Feb. 20-27, 1911
"DLUE is tlie sky and deeper bine the sea,
Purple the hills that lie beyond again;
Quite near at hand the many varied trees
Display their brilliant foliage in the sun,
While here and there a rich mimosa stands,
Great branches covered o’er with golden bloom;
And red tiled villas gaily harmonize,
Enhancing all the rich bright colour scheme.
0 Cannes, sweet Cannes, what can be said of thee,
Thy walks so fair, and all the beauty round ?
The pleasure of it all is almost pain,
So deep are feelings stirred the eyes grow dim,
The body tingles merely with delight;
1 must stretch forth my hands to drink it in.
IN ROME
Feb. 28—March 15,
TN Rome the strangest things occurred,
But you must never say you’ve heard;
It is not for the world to know,
So do not say I told you so.
Downstairs we are so very swell
In this magnificent hotel,
So many in the salon wait
There’s almost one for every plate.
And then by day we have a guide,
While in a carriage fine we ride
To visit all the ruins rare
That are in Rome just everywhere.


But after dinner: oh, what shocks !
In evening dress I wash my socks,
While Hell before the mirror stands
Combing her hair with her own hands !
At last we really get to bed;
I go to sleep, hut Hell instead
Will lie awake for hours and hours
Dreaming of walls and ruined towers.
The guide, you know, is quite a dear,
But Hell’s attracted him, I fear;
We thought a mission man she’d wed,
She rather fancies Rome instead.
I’d really like to mention here,
In case it’s not so very clear,
We have old clothes to go about;
You could but laugh at our rigs-out.
Hell has a simple navy blue
That must have seen a year or two,
While mine has seen no less than three,
With skirt quite wide and flowing free.
The ladies here have skirts quite tight;
You can imagine what a sight
We must appear to their quick eyes,
And on each face is stamped surprise.
But we don’t mind; we ’re here to see,
Hot to be seen by Society;
We know that in a few weeks hence
In London town we T 1 spend some pence
When next you see us in the park,
Why such a difference you ’ll remark,
You’ll hardly know us then, I guess,
In latest fashioned walking dress.


While in the evening at the play
You ’ll hardly know quite what to say;
In fact, you could not fail to think
I look just exquisite in pink.
Our little ISTell thinks she ’ll have blue
Because it suits her, which is true;
With patent shoes and stockings gay
The tout ensemble will be tout a fad.
Good-niglit, dear friend, to you 1 T 1 say,
And write again some other day;
It’s really getting very late,
And we must be up by half-past eight.
MY SECOND VISIT TO ROME
1 h I 'IS strange to be in Rome, th’ eternal, once again,
A And visit all the ancient ruins round;
To stand upon the very self-same ground
Where Csesars trod, or martyrs suffered pain.
One can but in imagination see
The times when Roman power was at its height,
The centre of the world it ruled by might,
And feel the awe of its great majesty.
Rome was the first great Christian mission field;
Peter and Paul, and many more beside,
Were martyred here because they would not yield
Their faith to satisfy the Caesar’s pride.
Most wondrous place! the link that holds us fast
To all the interests of a glorious past.
AN EPISODE
Kathleen.
<l \[OW, Margery dear, you’ll really be late
At Derry & Toms’ to try on your gown,
So do hurry up and put on your hat,
I’ve ordered the motor to take us to town.”


A Wanderer’s Rhymes
Margery.
“Yes, now I’m ready; I’ve everything on,
Except that my shoes are really not tied !”
Kathleen.
“Oh ! never mind that till we get in the car.
You’re really most trying!” her poor sister cried.
Margery.
“ Just look at the country! as pretty as ever,
In spite of the frightful, continuous rain;
And in a few weeks all the trees will be budding;
I declare it’s delightful to be home again.
My goodness ! how quickly along we are going !
We hardly have time to look all around;
The car is a beauty, and who can deny it;
It goes up the hills without making a sound.”
Kathleen.
“Now here we are, Margery; out you get quickly;
I really declare we’re half an hour late! ”
Margery.
“Oh ! that’s really nothing. I’ve often been late.
What good does it do to be in such a state ?”
Shop Assistant.
“Good afternoon, madam. Follow me. Will you kindly
Step in here, and the skirt-maker I’ll send.”
Kathleen.
“Now, Margery, please don’t look round you so mildly,
There are ninety-nine things to which to attend.”
Margery.
“ Good gracious ! how awful! ”


Kathleen.
“Why, what is the matter?”
Margery.
“I declare I’ve forgotten my top petticoat!”
Kathleen.
“Now, Margery dear, you are really most shocking!”
Margery.
“How on earth did Ido it? Oh, ain’t I a goat!’
Kathleen.
“You do look a sketch as there you are standing
In that short white flannel; but what can we do?”
Margery.
“ Oh, nothing, I’m sure; I suppose I can bear it!
But it’s really a terrible how-do-you-do !”
THE AUSTRALIANS’ FAREWELL TO THEIR
ROMAN GUIDE
WITH aching hearts and tearful eyes
We wandered o’er the Forum old
With “Pumph” Francesco Frati, guide,
And listened hard to all he told.
We’d been with him for nine whole days,
In him we put our faith and trust;
He knew the date of every stone,
He knew the name of every bust.
There was no fresco but he knew
Its every meaning there displayed;
For every church or palace fair
He estimated what was paid.


With wondrous patience he’d repeat
What he had said the day before,
Or write down things of great import,
Advised us books to read galore.
So when we’d seen the Palatine,
And all the wonders he’d explained,
We found it even hard to speak
As down our cheeks the salt tears rained.
Till when we reached the very door
Of this magnificent hotel
We asked his name; he gave his card,
And then we said our last farewell.
We turned and entered, while he went
Down the long road away from us;
Then both with frightful, wrenching sobs
We reached our room, and Nell spoke thus
“If ever I return to Pome
1 want to have the same old guide,
To listen to the ancient tales
Francesco Frati tells with pride.”
FROM THE HOTEL WINDOW, ROME
npo look out of the window,
-*■ At any time of day,
Is really just as comic
As almost any play.
Immediately below you
A lot of cabbies stand;
They call to every passer,
And beckon with one hand.
Aon soon know there’s a train in
By all the rush and roar,
The shout of railway porters
As out the people pour.


’T is then the anxious cabby
Dexterity displays
In evading the policeman
In many different ways.
The keeper of the peace is there,
To see that there ’s no crush;
If he should chance to look away,
A cab goes with a rush.
He hardly knows just what to do.
If that one he should chase,
The others would not miss the chance,
And so away would race.
They are so very cunning,
You don’t know what to pay;
They wind their taximetres
While you look the other way !
So if you ever come to Rome,
Be sure you take the car;
You pay a very modest fare,
And know just where you are.
One day I saw a cabby,
Quite calmly in the street,
Get out his nails and hammer,
And shoe his horse’s feet!
And then there are the people
Always walking to and fro;
There are so very many,
You wonder where they go.
The women here are hatless
Among the lower class,
But their hair is always natty,
Although their clothes won't pass.


They go together arm in arm,
Meandering along;
They ’re never in a hurry,
But just go with the throng.
The men seem mostly portly,
And better far are dressed,
Although they really do not mind
A highly coloured vest.
The way the stout old porter
From this hotel, so great,
Goes to meet the new arrivals
I really must relate.
He wears an old gold waistcoat,
A suit of dull dark brown,
And when he bows them over,
They feel they own the town.
There are men here with mosaics,
And others with post cards;
It ’s hard to get away from them,
They follow you for yards.
They know that you are foreign
From the moment you appear;
They say their wares are “very cheap,’
You call them “very dear.”
A child with a bunch of violets
Will thrust it in your frock,
Expecting to get “soldi”
From out your slender stock.
And if you should refuse him,
Such looks on you he ’ll cast;
Or often he will curse you
As onward you go past.


There is a fascination
About this curious place ;
’T is now a child will interest you,
’T is now a woman’s face.
All this you see below you,
Grazing down upon the square,
Until all thought of time is gone
As you stand wondering there.
FLORENCE.
WITH hoary whiskers and flowing locks
Our Abraham stalks along the street,
While Hell and I come along behind
On our rather muddy and icy feet.
The rain pelts down unceasingly
As we go round to see the sights;
But what matters it? We wear old clothes;
We do not mind if we look frights.
We first gaze at the gi'eat bronze doors
Of the old octagonal Baptistry,
And marvel that one small human mind
Could plan this work so wondrously.
We go inside and listen there
To all that Abraham can relate
Of different parts of this ancient church
Still preserved in original state.
The Campanile then he shows,
Marvel of Giotto’s wonderful brain;
Tells of finishing the cathedral facade,
Whose front before was ugly and plain.


The picture galleries and buildings old,
The houses where poets and artists dwelt,
The mosaic work of the Florentines,
And for them all great wonderment felt.
In the afternoon, in a carriage, we drove
To the Piazzeli Michael Angelo,
To see the view of the mountains around,
With the city and river lying below.
For two whole days we went with Abe
Who took us around with the greatest zest;
He showed us houses of well-known men,
Such as Dante, Angelo, and all the rest.
We went to the convent of old St. Mark,
Where Savonarola had been the prior,
And frescoes of Fra Angelico
Adorn the walls of eveiy friar.
It’s a place of beauty and interest great,
This ancient town of the Florentines,
From the quaint old bridge of jewellers’ shops
To the surrounding hills with their cypress and
pines.
FROM FLORENCE TO VENICE.
Hilda.
OOD gracious ! How, Nellie, where shall we get in ?
The train is so full there isn’t a seat! ”
Nellie.
“I’m sure I don’t know the best thing to do;
It is really most trying, and no end of a treat.”


Hilda.
“ Let’s get in here and stand up for a bit,
And then we can see if there isn’t a place.
These Italians are shocking the way they go on;
If this crush were in England’t would be a disgrace ! ”
Nellie.
“Well, now that we’ve started, I’ 11 just go along
And see if there’s room in the very front car.”
Pleasant English Yoice, No. 1.
“Won’t you sit down a minute, just while you wait?”
Hilda.
“Thank you; I ’ll stand till we know where we are.”
Nellie.
“I’ve been right along, but there’s really no space;
It seems there is nothing to do but stand here.”
Pleasant English Voice, No. 2.
“If you don’t mind a squeeze, there is room here for two.”
Hilda and Nellie (both together).
“Oh! thank you so much, but we ’ll crush you, I fear.”
Hilda.
“ You are really most brave to have down this window.”
P.E.V., No. 2.
“Well, we can’t get along without some fresh air.”
Hilda.
“But these people here are so idiotic.
We often feel like it, although we don’t dare.”
Nellie.
“How truly amusing. There’s one of them gone;
I suppose we have really frozen him out.”


A Wanderer’s Rhymes
P.E.Y., No. 1.
“ The other one glares at the window so hard;
He thinks we are tenable creatures, no doubt.”
Hilda.
“It is really quite awful the way we go on;
With the window wide open he ’s sure to catch cold;
We must be polite, and have it half shut,
Or else he will think us too horribly bold.”
P.E.Y., No. 2.
“Well, let’s go to dinner, or else we ’ll be late,
And they ’ll give our seats at the table away.”
Nellie.
“How the train rocks about; I can’t get along;
But really I’m going as fast as I may.”
Hilda.
“Let’s return to our carriage now the train’s stopped;
It will be very easy to go along now.
Good gracious alive!”
Nellie.
“Why, what is the matter?”
Hilda.
“ The wretches have closed all the windows, I vow!
We must have one open; I really can’t bear it,
And already my head is beginning to ache.
Yes, now that is better, the air feels quite different;
How can these poor wretches make such a mistake ? ”
P.E.Y., No. 1.
“ Did you notice that man who sat in the corner ?
He’s put his hat on, and gone out at the door.”
P.8.Y., No. 2.
“Well, when he comes back I suppose we must shut it;
But it is really quite horrid to have such a bore.”


Nellie.
“ I cannot help laughing; it is really too funny
The way that poor window is put up and down;
And now that it has hut the weest crack open,
That man in the corner continues to frown.”
NEXT AFTERNOON.
Hilda.
“It’s really quite lonely without those two travellers
I really felt sad when we said our farewell.”
Nellie.
“They were such a comfort on that railway journey,
And we felt so much safer from train to hotel.”
RATHER SENTIMENTAL.
'C'LOATING along in a gondola
Under the Bridge of Sighs,
Gazing down in the limpid depths
Of your beautiful big blue eyes.
Life is so happy and joyous now,
Just for you and me;
Oh that it were for evermore
From sorrow and care quite free!
I feel such a thrill of ecstasy
As your soft hand lies in mine,
While you nestle close in your tender trust,
And your eyes like bright stars shine.
See, as we come to the Grand Canal,
The moonlight’s silver rays
Light up the water and make it dance
As thousands of tiny fays.


Here is a man who with his guitar
Sings some sweet melody,
While all around the whispering sounds
Blend in pure harmony.
See with what ease and natural grace
The gondolier dips his oar;
There’s scarcely a ripple, or even a splash,
As further we go from the shore.
The colour around is a poem itself,
The air so pure and so clear,
The whole of the world seems somehow changed
With you sitting close to me here.
Why should we leave to go to the land,
Where all is bustle and noise,
The crunching of wheels, the clatter of hoofs,
Motors, and other mad toys P
But life is a lesson that has to be learnt.
Every passage, easy and hard,
Must be conquered and thoroughly understood,
Or the whole of the sequence is marred.
So let us return to the work to be done
In that country so far away,
And live with the hope that just you and I
Will come back to Venice some day.
IN VENICE
WE glide along in a gondola
Of dull dark black, through many canals,
Imagining all the darksome deeds
Done by ancient Venetian principals.


Hearing never the sound of a hoof,
Or a wheel go rattling along the street;
Only occasional snatches of song,
Chattering voices, and clatt’ring of feet.
All is myst’ry and full of romance,
Intoxicating the senses like wine;
It takes us hack to those strenuous times
When the loss of a head was the usual fine.
The Doge and Republic of ancient days
No longer exist in the present time,
But they’ve left their traces on all the canals,
The indication of things in their prime.
Great palaces rare line the Grand Canal
That were built for Doge and Aristocrat,
Moorish, and Gothic, and Byzantine,
Some with round lintels and others with flat.
The Lion of St. Mark, and St. Theodore,
Standing on two granite pillars so high,
Guard the entrance to Piazza San Marc,
Where all around tame pigeons fly.
There, in the centre of this wondrous town,
The Ducal Palace of historical fame
Looks o’er the Square of the Grand Canal,
Where the Senate met and Ambassadors came.
San Marco’s Church, and many besides,
All with some interest, great or small;
One with the tombs of artists and saints,
Another for paintings or carved organ stall.
Under Rialto Bridge we pass,
With its great white arch so wonderful,
And as in the quiet water we look
There’s reflected a picture as beautiful.


A Wanderer’s Rhymes
We slip in and out of the various craft
With which the canals are always afloat,
While with easy grace the young gondolier
Plies his long oar at the end of the boat.
It is quite unique, this city of Yenice,
There is none other like it on all the earth,
A place where folk should forget to be sad,
’T is only for happiness, joy, and mirth.
AT LUGANO
WE walked down a narrow path
Beside a mountain rill,
Which rushed down to Lugano Lake,
Lying so blue and still;
Till coming to a well-worn track
Across an open green,
We went to gather some wild flowers
Which from the path we ’d seen.
There were growing dainty primroses,
Each in her yellow gown,
And snowflakes pure of white and green
Hanging their shy heads down;
While clumps of modest violets,
Both white and purple-blue,
Were peeping out along the banks,
And white anemones too.
Then, having gathered all we wished,
We went up through a wood
To an open rise on the other side,
Where for a space we stood


To gaze at the scene before us.
In their majesty so fine
Stood great white snow-capped mountains
Aglow with bright sunshine.
They seemed just like grand guardians
Around this beauteous lake,
Standing firm like strong, old soldiers
That almost naught could shake.
With heads erect among the clouds,
Shining so pure and white,
We could but stand in silence there,
In a spell at this great sight.
And walking down the hillside
Towards the township there,
We often had to turn and gaze
Upon this scene so fair.
AFTER A SNOWSTORM IN LUCERNE
WE slowly wandered up some wooden steps
That led up a steep slope through a pine wood,
While all around the snow fell softly down,
Until at last upon the top we stood
To gaze in wonderment at the fair scene
That opened out in front. It seemed
As though to fairyland we must have come,
For on each leaf and bough the white snow gleamed.
Some pines, too heavy laden, bent their boughs
Until they seemed almost to touch the earth;
Others, with outstretched fingers, seemed to point,
To silence all loud speech or vulgar mirth.
Right underneath, the tiny young fir trees
Were covered quite with a warm, soft, white cloak —


It mi glit have been a little fairy tent
Where in cold weather dwelt these strange, small folk.
All on the ground, on every blade or leaf.
The snow had fallen like a sweet caress —
It looked as though some genii’s magic wands
Had changed it all to lacey loveliness.
All in and out we wandered through the wood
On this small path with many a graceful bend,
And felt an awe in silence so intense.
It would have been too much without a friend
To talk to, and so banish all suspense
By thoughts exchanged and feeling someone near;
It would have brought a strange, mysterious fear
Lest something superhuman should arise
To clutch you with a hand of curious might,
And drag you with him, powerless to resist,
Thousands of feet below, far out of sight.
A long way on we came upon a gap
Through which we caught a glimpse of distant scene:
Houses half buried in a drift of snow,
Fields of pure white, with hedgerows in between.
It is a wondrous thing, this snowy coat
That covers every twig or tiny ridge —
A work of patient building. One by one
Each small flake falls and helps to form a bridge.
In places where banks rose up from the road
Were hundreds and hundreds of tiny little spears,
Small icicles that stood up like some growth
Formed by dripping trees, clusters of frozen tears.
’T was sad to think we had to leave it all
And wend our way back to the dull old town;
But with regret at last we turned away
And, by the steep, rough, frozen path, walked down.


IN GAY PARIS
'T'O gay Paris of world-wide fame
Hilda Roach and Nell Cornish came
To see the sights, both old and new,
Of which this city boasts a few.
That naught they ’d miss they had a guide,
And in carriage and pair they left with pride.
The guide sat on the high box seat
Beside the coachman, trim and neat.
They first got out at Notre Dame,
And went inside to see the charm
Of architecture, old and fine,
With pillars Roman and Byzantine.
From there they went to the Pantheon,
On whose fair dome the sunlight shone,
Arid saw on the walls the paintings of mark:
Genevieve, Clovis, Charlemagne, and Jeanne d’Arc.
Then on to the Luxembourg Gallery,
The modern sculpture and painting to see;
The Palais de Justice and Chapel Royal —
One thing which the Commune didn’t spoil.
After luncheon they made an early move,
And went straight away to visit the Louvre,
Seeing noted pictures and sculpture, chiefly
“The Venus of Milo” and “Wings of Victory.”
To L’Hotel des Invalids then they went,
And to the tomb of Napoleon their footsteps bent,
Being greatly impressed by the amber light
That slaines in the chapel by day and by night.
And many more sights they saw that fine day
Before they returned and their guide went away.
Ever since then they have walked through the
streets
Looking for shops to buy nice cakes and sweets.


VERSAILLES
T'ITE drove along in a carriage and pair
* * Through the beautiful Bois du Boulogne,
With its winding roads, and paths, and lakes,
Finest park of the temperate zone.
And after two hours we come to Yersailles,
The famed summer home of French kings;
We saw the big and small Trianons,
The hamlet, and other fine things.
The big Trianon Louis XIV built
For Madame de Maintenon;
And Louis XY for la Pompadour
Ordered the small Trianon.
The hamlet of eighteen thatched cottages
Louis XVI built for his wife,
The beautiful Marie Antoinette,
Where she acted the peasant’s life.
The Palace of Versailles, more wonderful still.
After luncheon we went to see,
Where kings and their courts had lived in fine state,
While the poor lived in scarcity.
Here are paintings of battles of historic fame,
And ceilings of legend in art,
While one of the rooms is now set aside
To honour the great Bonaparte.
The grounds are a wonder of science and art,
So beautifully are they laid out
In pathways and terraces symmetrical,
And forty-eight fountains that spout.
And it took us right back to that far-away time
When kings were quite absolute,
And took all the money from the people who worked,
While none could the taxes refute.


Spring Time
SPRING is here ! Spring is here !
No more should any sadness
Fill our hearts, nor fall a tear,
For Spring, sweet Spring, is here!
See, the trees no more are bare,
But the fresh green leaves are growing,
And are dancing in the air,
Wondrous beauty everywhere.
Listen to the gentle wooing
Of the pigeons and the doves,
All their tender hopes renewing
With their billing and their cooing.
All the birds are busy working,
Picking up small twigs and straws
For the nests that they are making,
’Midst much fluttering and chirping.
All around the flowers are filling
The wide land with all their beauty,
Thus their destiny fulfilling,
Spite of frosty air so chilling.
Everything around rejoices,
From old age to little children;
Listen to the happy voices;
Lads and lassies, make your choices.
For’t is Spring, ’t is Spring, ’t is Spring !
Making all the world so bright,
Touching each harmonious string,
Bringing joy to everything.
Let us sing, let us sing, for ’tis Spring.


St. Christopher’s
HAVE you ever heard of St. Christopher’s ?
’T is a building of great renown,
Not for size, but wonderful learning and art,
In the centre of Torquay town.
The owners of this really wonderful place
Are famed Mr. and Mrs. Brown,
For he is headmaster of St. Winnifred’s,
In the upper part of the town.
Dr. Mead, a sister of Mrs. Brown,
Is visiting here for a time;
And another friend, Lady Helen of Troy,
Who all o’er the country hills climb.
Also Miss Knight, who constantly sews
At household linen and such;
And young Mr. Baker, who pops in and out,
But is not seen very much.
There are also two men from the far-away East
Come here to study and cram
For their entrance exams, to the ’Varsities
(They also seem fond of jam) !
We cannot miss out Mr. Robinson,
A quite remarkable man,
A walking encyclopaedia,
And known from Beersheba to Dan.
He really has a curious way
Of spending each evening;
He carries around a tiny blue hag
By a dainty blue corded string;


While inside the bag, if you chance to look in,
There’s a quaintly-rounded loom,
On which he can knit the most wonderful chains
That stretch right across the room.
Nor should be forgot little Hilda Roach,
So quiet, simple, and meek,
Who sits in the corner, working away,
And listens while other folks speak.
If you should drop in for supper at nine,
You will see these people, no doubt,
Drinking hot milk or sweet lemonade,
While they throw bread and cheese about.
Mr. Robinson’s Reply
YOUR lovely poem I have read
With pleasure and with tears;
Please may I learn it off by heart,
To say in after years P
I like the things you say of me,
But really think you flatter;
My ignorance is very great
On each important matter.
And of yourself you little say,
Your modesty is great;
The pretty things I’d like to write
I really dare not state.
But this at least may be allowed —
I thank you for your rhymes,
And they will be a memory
Of many pleasant times.


In Reply to Mr. Robinson.
/~VH, thank you, Mr. Robinson,
For your four pretty verses;
You would have forty pounds for them
If we had bigger purses.
But since we have not, please accept
Our true congratulations—
Ray, don’t he such a modest man
With all your protestations.
I do assure you they were fine,
And much appreciated;
In after years their history
Will often he related.
And when at last your days are done
(Although you may not know it),
A tomb in some great city church
We ’ll raise, and call you “poet.”
G. HASSELL AND SON, PEINTEES.
