“Paradise Cost to Paradise Gained/'
PREFACE.
Of all the themes which appeal to the heart and mind
of man, none is of greater interest and importance than
the subject of this life and the one beyond. Many
speculate and doubt as to the fall of man. The scrip-
tures only reveal the light of God’s Word, spoken by
men “as they were moved by the Holy Ghost ” : 2
Peter 1-21.
Said Christ, “ Thy Word is truth,” John 17-17.
Again “ search the scriptures ” : John 5-39. From
Genesis 1 to Revelation 22, Christ is the source of
Creation and Redemption. Only few details are given
here to the searcher for truth, sufficient to indicate the
eternal purpose of God.
From Eden lost, fresh from the Creator’s hand, to
Paradise regained. Lost through disobedience, finally
to be restored to the overcomer through the redemptive
work of Jesus Christ, who will save, bring back, or
restore that which was lost: Luke 19-10. The scrip-
ture brought forward is in harmony with the divine
plan, given by the inspiration of God : 2 Timothy 3-16,
17. With the hope that he who readeth may under-
stand.
Paradise Lost.
The human mind is often at a loss to understand the
design of the Creator in forming this world. Though
not for a selfish motive, it was to some extent for His
pleasure: Revelation 4-11. Its original beauty
marred, traces of the divine touch are yet to be seen.


In all His creative work which takes our minds back
to the time when in its freshness and beauty He gave
it to man, whom He made to crown all that He had
created. To him dominion over all was given, wherein
was found the breath of life : Genesis 1-26, 28. God
also prepared his food in which were all the elements
to sustain life and pronounced it very good : Genesis
1-29, 31.
It was here that the Sabbath was made and given to
mankind : Genesis 2-1, 3. Made for man : Mark 2-28.
To Adam it was a spiritual rest even before he began to
work. Thus Jehovah requires us to acknowledge Him
first in all our ways. He gave the earth to the race :
Psalm 115-16 ; to inhabit it ; Isa. 45-18. Placed man
in Eden on probation with a special command : Gen.
2-15,17. Here also the marriage institution was set up,
with all its sacredness and divine authority, yet how
many have departed from that sacred vow : Gen. 1-18.
Here the first trouble and deception were brought to
the home through him who rebelled in heaven, who
turned the truth of God into a he, and said “ ye shall
not surely die.” From that time deception and the lie
have increased. But into the City of God nothing that
defileth shall enter : Rev. 21-27.
With the fall came the curse, which we may discern
on every hand. By it they lost their lives and their
peace with God, also the dominion: Gen. 3-1, 24.
Christ came to seek and to save that which was lost :
Luke 19-10. By “ one man sin entered into the
world ” : Rom. 5-12. If it had not been so, Adam
would still have reigned as king, retained the dominion,
and Eden would still have been the home of the race,
and God’s plan would have been carried out. Even
now, all that was lost by the first Adam will be restored
by the second : Micah 4-8.
Make thee an Ark.
When Adam disobeyed the command of God, an
angel was sent to guard the way of the tree of life, lest
he partake of the fruit and become an immortal sinner.
In the fruit there was power to perpetuate life. By
disobedience came death which since then hath passed
upon all men: Romans 5-12. Sin is transgression:
1 John 3-4. When men began to multiply, sin increased
with them. The declaration went forth “My Spirit
shall not always strive with man.” His days were
allotted to 120 years, because his wickendess was great.


His thoughts were only evil: Gen. 6-1, 5. God grieved
that He had made man, and all which He had given
Him, because the whole earth was corrupt and filled
with violence : verses 6 to 12.
Noah being a righteous man found favour with God.
He said unto Noah, “ the end of all flesh has come
before me, make thee an ark ” God Himself was the
Great Architect, Noah being the master builder. God
gave Noah full instructions how to build : verses 13-16.
He also said “ I do bring a flood of water upon the
earth . . . But with thee I will establish my cove-
nant ” : verses 17-18. While building the ark, Noah
solemnly warned the inhabitants of the impending
flood and the consequences thereof.
The message for that time was righteousness by faith,
Noah believed God, and as with Abraham “it was
counted to Him for righteousness.” Thus he warned
them of their sins, of righteousness, and a judgment to
come. They heeded it not, and their own course of life
brought about their destruction. How many are
being warned to-day, how few respond. Christ declared
the last days would be like those of Noah : see Matthew
24 ; 37-39 ; Luke 17 ; 26-30.
Come into the Ark.
To the world Noah and his family became an object
lesson. By his righteous deeds he found favour with
God : Genesis 6 ; 8. Like the Apostle Paul he was a
chosen vessel to be used of God for the furtherance of
the gospel, and the uplifting of the standard of righ-
teousness by faith. Noah, like Abraham “ believed
God ”.: verse 17, Gen. 15 : 6. What is faith ? ;
Hebrews 11 : 1, 2. Noah became heir of this righ-
teousness : verses 7, 8. In this Adam failed through
his unbelief.
As the building of the ark was drawing to a close, so
the message of mercy was nearing its end, and God is
not slack concerning His promises : 2 Peter 3 ; 9 ;
Genesis 6 : 18. God said “ Come into the ark,” and
God shut him in : Gen. 9 : 1, 13-16. By this act the
world was shut out. In that evil day God had some
who lived the life of righteousness by faith before an
evil world, though only a few. The “ little flock,”
the “ remnant.” Here as is often the case, the majority
were on the wrong side, and this will be repeated in


another form at the second advent of Christ: 2 Thess.
I : 7-9. As in Noah’s time, so the message for these
last days (Rev. 14 : 6-10) is “ righteousness by faith ”
to prepare a people for their soon coming Lord.
We should heed the warning, “ Come into the ark.”
The judgments of God are in the earth to-day—famines,
pestilence, and earthquakes in various places. Said
Christ: “ these are the beginning of sorrows ” : Mat-
thew 24 : 7, 8. We are living in “ perilous times ”
when “ men’s hearts are failing them for fear ” : Luke
21 : 26. In Matthew 24 : 37-39, Christ compares the
last days to those of the flood.
The Birth of Jesus.
For hundreds of years the prophets had foretold the
advent of the Messiah for which many looked and
searched. The plan of salvation had long been settled
in heaven. It was then Christ became the “ Lamb
slain from the foundation of the world ” : Revelation
13 : 6. Many ask why this early provision. For one
reason, as stated in John 3 : 16. In that love was the
redemption of mankind, which was first made known
in Eden when it was declared there would be “ enmity
between thee and the woman ” : Gen. 3:15. It was
foretold by the prophet Isaiah 7 : 14. God with us :
Matthew 1 : 22, 23. His mission was to save from
sin : verse 21 ; and to save that which was lost:
Luke 19 : 10. In His stay in Egypt and the call to
abide in Nazareth, the scriptures were fulfilled :
Matthew 2 : 13-23 ; and cannot be broken : John
10: 35.
Jesus Baptized.
John’s mission was to prepare the way and make
straight paths for the advent of Christ. His solemn
message was like that of Noah—“ Righteousness by
faith.” Said he, “ repent ” : Matthew 3 : 2,3. When
questioned, he answered “ I am the voice ” : John 1 :
22, 23 ; Isaiah 40 : 3—B. Only a “ voice,” yet in His
message was power : Matthew 28 : 18. When he saw
Jesus he exclaimed : “ Behold the Lamb of God ” :
John 1 : 29. Jesus requests John to baptize him
(Matt. 3 : 13-15) “ for thus it bocometh us to fulfil all
righteousness.” If it were a righteous act for Jesus to


take part in this ordinance, why should not those who
profess to follow Him take up his cross and do likewise ?
Matt. 16 : 24, 25. With this act of Jesus the Father
was well pleased : Matt. 3 : 16, 17. In the great com-
mission they were to preach the gospel to every crea-
ture : Mark 16 : 15 ; baptizing and teaching them to
observe all things he had commanded: Matt. 28 :
19, 20 ; with the promise as stated in Mark 16 : 16.
These words of Christ show that baptism is essential
to salvation. This must exclude infants, for they have
learned nothing of Christ or His gospel. The “ be-
lievers ” are to be planted together with Christ :
Romans 6 : 2—5. Said Christ: “ Every plant that My
heavenly Father, etc. : Matt. 15 : 13. We notice
first “ It becometh us,” secondly, it is a direct com-
mand, thirdly, immersion is not sprinkling, fourthly,
the promise, fifth, is essential to salvation, sixth, it is a
memorial of Christ’s death and resurrection.
The Last Supper.
Just before the close of His ministry, Christ gathered
His disciples together to partake of their last meal with
Him before He was taken from them. Then taking the
bread, He blessed it, saying “ This is my body,” like-
wise the cup saying, “ This is my blood ” : Mark 14 :
22-25. Supper being ended they began to be sorrowful
because they were about to lose Him whom they had
learned to love ; the devil having put into the heart of
Judas to betray Him : John 13 : 1,2. Girding Himself
He began to wash their feet, humbling Himself to
become servant of all. Peter would not consent.
There was a lesson for him to learn, humbleness of
heart and mind, and to become as a little child : Mat-
thew 18 : 2,3; John 13 ; 6-9. Afterwards Jesus
said : “ Know ye what I have done unto you ? ” In
this He gave them an example which they would find
happiness in following.
Christ Crucified.
There are millions who have not heard of the suffer-
ings and death of Christ, and yet He said “ this gospel
of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world.”
Not to save it, but as a “ witness ” ; Matthew 24 : 14.
He was betrayed and sold: Matthew 26: 14, 15;


Zechariah 11: 12, 13. Deserted by His followers:
Zech. 13 : 7 ; Matt. 26 : 31, 56 ; wounded by His
friends ; Zech. 13 : 6 ; for our transgressions : Isaiah
53 : 5 ; despised and rejected of men : Isa. 63 :. 3, 4.
His own received Him not: John 1 : 10—12 ; given
over to Pilate, who declared “ I find no fault in Him ” :
John 19 :| 4. Pilate said “ I am innocent, etc. ” :
Matt. 27 : 24. Said the people “ His blood be upon
us ” : verse 25. After they had done their worst,
Jesus prayed “ Father forgive them ” : Luke 23 : 34.
Even the soldiers fulfilled the scriptures : John 19 :
23, 24, 34-37 ; Psalm 22 : 16-18 ; Psalm 69 : 20, 21.
He was numbered with the transgressors : Mark 15 :
27, 28. Of these one asked “ Lord, remember me, etc.”:
Luke 23 ; 42. Jesus replied, “ I say unto thee to-day,”
etc. : verse 43. That promise was not to be fulfilled
that day, but in the future, placing the comma, as in
the old English version, immediately after “ to-day,”
gives us the correct rendering. For proof, Christ did
not go to Paradise that day, but slept in the tomb :
see John 20 : 1,2, 9, 10 ; Psalm 16 : 10. When Jesus
asked Mary “ why weepest thou ?” and she recog-
nized Him, turning to embrace Him, Jesus said
“ touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my
Father”: John 20: 11-17. The same evening He
appeared to His disciples, saying “ peace be unto you.”
Then He showed them His hands and His side, and they
were glad : verses 18—20. These are written that ye
might believe: verses 30, 31.
The Ascension.
Said Christ “ All power is given unto Me in heaven
and on earth ” : Matthew 28 : 18. Since He was the
world’s Creator, and gave life to all, man as well (Gen-
esis 1 : 26), no other could claim His right. His power
had been demonstrated during His ministry on many
occasions. The Psalmist, speaking of His power, says :
“By His word were the heavens made ” : Psalm 33 :
6-9. When He spake, Lazarus came forth. He
declared “ I am the resurrection and the life ” : John
11 : 35. Of His own life He said “ I have power to
lay it down, etc. ” : John 10: 17, 18. After His
resurrection He told Mary He was about to ascend :
John 20: 17. When speaking of the many mansions
He said, “If I go, I ( will come again ” : John 14 : 1-3.
In that,.promise to fulfil. go ?
Yes. Many witnesses saw Him: Acts 1 : 9-11. He


will so come in like manner, on a cloud. “ Behold He
cometh with clouds, and every eye shall see Him ” :
Rev. 1 : 7. He ascended up on high to fulfil all things :
Ephesians 4 : 8-10.
On the first morning of the week after the Sabbath,
when the women came to sepulchre, they found their
Lord had risen. All the power behind the Roman
Government could not keep him in the tomb. The
time had come and the angel was commissioned to
release Him from the tomb. Power was given Him
to roll aw ay the stone, the keepers were stricken by His
glory, an i Christ came forth, having gained the victory
over death and the grave : Matthew 28 : I—6.
Seventy Weeks and the Two Thousand Three Hundred Days
In this diagram is brought to view some remarkable
dates in connection with the fulfilment of scripture.
The 70 weeks, or 490 days of Daniel 9 : 24, were to be
the first part of the 2,300 days, both starting from the
same point. God has graciously laid down a plan
whereby we may understand, if we will. Said He :
“ The secret things, etc.” : Deut. 29 : 29. This being
revealed, surely belongs unto us. God uses days to
represent years : Numbers 14 : 34 ; Ezekiel 4 : 5, 6 ;
each day for a year. Thus the 70 weeks and the 2,300
days represent years.
They commence at the “ going forth of the command-
ment ” : Dan. 9 : 24, 25 ; Ezra, 7th chapter. In the
seventh year of Artaxerxes Longimanua, 457 8.C., an
exact date to start from; The building and restoration
occupied seven weeks or forty-nine years. From here
three score and two weeks, or 483 years, total 69 weeks,
reaching to the Messiah, who was baptized and an-
nointed to preach the gospel, A.D. 27, declaring “ the
time is fulfilled ” : Mark 1 : 14, 15. Three and one-
half years later Christ was cut off, or crucified in the
midst of the 70th week, and caused the sacrifice, etc. :
Dan. 9 : 26, 27. During the remaining three and a half
years the Jews rejected the gospel, stoned Stephen,
Paul was converted and chosen to carry the gospel to
the Gentiles : Acts 9 : 15, 16 ; thus terminating the
70 weeks or 490 years which were allotted to the Jews.
Notice, by taking 457 from 2300 years there remains
1843 years, also taking 490 years, which extend to
A.D. 34, from 2,300 leaves 1810, which added to 34
brings us down to the autumn of 1844, when the 2,300
years terminated and ushered in the time of the
judgment.


Christ our High Priest.
The ministration of the High Priest in the earthly
sanctuary of Lev. 16, is now carried out by Christ
Himself, in the heavenly sanctuary, offering His own
blood, as a better sacrifice for sin in the presence of God
for us : Heb. 9 ; 23-26. In the earthly sanctuary was
the mercy seat, where Jehovah appeared in a cloud ;
the ark of His covenant, in which the ten command-
ments were placed, and the table of shew bread,
together with the golden candlestick: Exodus 25:
30—32. “ There I will meet with thee ” : verses 21, 22 ;
Lev. 16 : 2. This office is one of mediation between
God and the sinner, offering the blood of the sacrifice
to atone for sin. The sanctuary in heaven is to be
cleansed in a similar manner to the one on earth :
verse 16. The time for this we find in Daniel 8 : 14.
“ Then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.” We have
seen that brings us to 1844, when Christ entered the
most holy place, robed in His priestly garments, to
offer His own blood for us. Records of our deeds are
made. Daniel saw the judgment set and books
opened : Dan. 7 : 10 ; also John; Rev. 20: 12.
Those were the books of life and death, also of remem-
brance : Malachi 3 : 16-18. When an investigation
is made in books, it is rightly called an “ investigative
judgment ” in which Christ is now engaged, beginning
with the righteous dead and closing with the righteous
living. How soon our cases will be called we cannot
tell. Shall it be the “ well done ”or “ found wanting” ?
When Christ leaves the Most Holy Place there will be
no atoning blood to cleanse from sin. Then the sen-
tence of Rev. 22 : 11, 12, will go forth, “He that is
righteous,” etc., and “ Behold, I come quickly.”
Christ Comes Quickly.
Evidently the cleansing of the Sanctuary in heaven is
to prepare the way for the coming of the Lord. When
the sacrifice was made, in His agony He cried “It is
finished ” : John 19 : 30. His work for the redemption
of mankind, begun on earth, will be completed in heaven.
He will gather His people who have made a covenant
with Him by sacrifice. “ Our God shall come and shall
not keep silence ” : Psalm 50 : I—s.


Christ’s promise in John 14 : 1-3. As He went the
angels said: “This same Jesus”; Acts 1; 9—ll.
Not as a Babe but a crowned King : Rev. 14 : 14 ;
with clouds, every eye shall see Him : Rev. 1 : 7.
“ Behold, I come quickly ” : Rev. 22 : 12 ; as the
lightning : Matthew 24 : 27 ; to take His people
home : John 14 : 3 ; without sin : Hebrews 9 : 28 ;
the hope of the Church : Titus 2 ; 11—13 ; not another :
2 Thess. 4 : 16.
Lo, this is our God ” : Isaiah 25 : 9. Enoch, the
seventh from Adam, looked for the second advent of
Christ, exclaiming “ Behold the Lord cometh ” : Jude
14. Are we looking that way ? If not, why not ?
The Holy City.
The promises of Christ to His Church were to inspire
them to works of faithfulness and love, and are for the
overcomer : Rev. 3 : 12. Here the new Jerusalem
is named the “ City of God.” Abraham looked for
this city, etc., Hebrews 11 : 8-10 indicating Ghd is the
Founder thereof. Christ said He was going to prepare
many mansions in it : John 14 : 1-3. Said an angel
to John : “ Come hither, and I will show thee, etc.” :
Rev. 21 : 9, 10. John saw it prepared : verse 2.
Promised to the overcomer to inherit it: verse 7.
A glorious description is given in few words. Having
the glory of God ; its walls great and high, 264 feet of
jasper like unto clear glass ; Rev. 21 : 8-10. Twelve
gates, each of one pearl ; twelve foundations of all
precious stones. It lieth four-square, 375 miles on
either side; the streets of pure gold: verses 11-22).
The great white throne in the centre, pure river of
water proceeding out of the throne : Rev. 22 : 1 ; the
saved walk in it; sea of glass mingled with fire : Rev.
15 : 2. No need of the sun or moon, no night there,
the Lamb is the light thereof : verses 23-26. Glorious
place. Will you be there, and I ? Shall we decide '!
Many will not be there : verses 8, 27. Only those
whose names are written in the book of life. Christ
promised the overcomer should walk with Him in white,
which denotes purity : Rev. 3 : 4, 5. Garments of
salvation are robes of righteousness ; Isaiah 61 : 10 ;
Rev. 7 : 9, 17.


The Tree of Life.
That wonderful Book, the Bible, opens with the tree
of life, closing with the same. First planted by the
Lord in Eden : Genesis 2 ; 8, 9. Test of obedience :
Genesis 3 ; 3. Partook of its fruits : verse 0. Angel
to keep the way of the tree : verse 24. The over-
comer promised to eat of it : Rev. 2 : 7. Bearing
twelve manner of fruits : Rev. 22 : 2. In the midst of
the Paradise : Rev. 2 : 7, last clause ; and its branches
extend to each side of the river of life. The leaves are
for the healing or for the service of the nations, or to
restore, to bring back, to the same condition as before
the fall, physically, when love reigned and all was pure.
“ Blessed are they who keep His commandments, that
they may have right to the tree of life ” : Revelation
22: 14.
Paradise Regained.
At creation, God established the earth to be inhabited
by a superior class of beings, therefore it was not created
in vaint Isaiah 45: 18. We read it was given to
mankind : Psalm 115 : 16, when he was created, with
it the dominion over all the earth, sea and air, and all
that was in them : Genesis 1 : 26. With Job we ask
“ What is man that thou shouldst magnify him, and
that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him ? : Job
7 : 17, 18. “ Thou madest him a little lower than the
angels ; Thou crownedst him with glory and honour,
and dost set him over the works of Thy hands ” :
Hebrews 2 : 7. Until the usurper wrested from him
the dominion, with which he lost his life, his peace with
God, his home. “ Nevertheless we look for a new
heaven and a new earth; 2 Peter 3 : 13. Happy
beings will inhabit it. Said Christ; “ The meek shall
inherit it ” : Matthew 5: 5. The Spirit of Christ
speaking through the Psalmist repeats the promise with
an abundance of peace ; Ps. 37 : 11. The wicked will
be cut off from it : verses 34, 22, 29. The mission of
Christ was to seek and to save that which was lost :
Luke 19 : 10 : to ransom, or bring back. The promise
of a new earth : Isa. 65 ; 17. In the new earth God’s
people will meet to worship upon the Holy Sabbath,
that, with other things, being restored to its former
place : Isa, 66 : 22, 23. In that country the over-


comer will begin life anew. There only meekness,
righteousness and peace will reign supreme. To those
who are seeking a better land, the curtain is lifted to
encourage us. The former things shall not come into
mind ; God will rejoice and joy in His people, no more
weeping, no more an infant of days. We shall build
and inhabit, plant and eat. The length of the days of
the tree of life, are His peoples. No more labour in
vain. Their offspring is with them. The wolf, lamb,
lion and bullock shall not hurt or destroy : Isa. 65 :
17-25. The dominion restored : Micah 4: 8. Re-
deemed shall reign on the earth: Rev. 5: 9, 10.
Given to the saints : Dan. 7 : 27. Be but one Lord,
one King : Zech. 14 : 9 ; Rev. 14 : 14 ; Rev. 19 : 16.
