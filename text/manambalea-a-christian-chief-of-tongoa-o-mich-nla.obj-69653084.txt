enemies?came to see me. I, of course,
fed them well, and gave them several
presents. After thus making a good im-
pression, I told them of my object in com-
ing, and pointed out their need of being
saved from sin and its consequences.
His Scouts.?
Several men from Selembanga, Manam-
fca?ea?s village, came to me to work for
some weeks; but it was a puzzle to me
to find out why he did not put in an
appearance with the other chief'. All that
I could get out of them was, ?He will
come by and by.? It was only long after
that it dawned on me that the e men had
been sent over to find out what Christi-
anity was ere he would commit himself
to it.
?We Would See Jesus.??
As an indication of how successful his
mode of finding out was, I may mention
the care of one of these men who had
bean with ire a few weeks. He came with
a number of women and said, ? We would
see Jesus.? I to'd them that Jesus was
not there. He then explained that it was
a picture of the crucifixion he had seen
that they wanted to have a look at.
When I brought out the picture he com-
menced to explain to the women how that
Jesus had died for our sins. One of the
women turned to me and asked if that
was true.
Himself.?
One day when I came home after visit-
ing some villages Manamoana, my first
convert, introduced to me Manambalea,
adding, ? Th's is a big man on Tongoa.?
After a few words I went for some food
for him, and also attended to my own
needs. Then I commenced to speak to
him and to answer his many questions
about Christianity. He stayed with me
till a very late hour learning to sing
hymns, listening to what I had to tell
him, and ask'ng questions. He evidently
wanted to take it all in in one sitting.
At last I had to tell him to go up to
the house to sleep. He remained
with me till after dinner the next day.
He soon came back, and remained for
days. H?s stays with me became longer,
and he sooned learned to read, and was
always pleased to go with me on my
preaching tours.
His Village.?
I soon went with him to his own vil-
lage. He took me round to a number of
houses, among these to one where there
was an old blind man. When we got
there he said to him, ? I have brought
the man of God, who has come to see
you.? The poor old fellow crept out of
his house, and said, ? Oh, let me feel
him!? I remained with him for a con-
siderable time trying as simply as possible
to explain to him the way of salvation.
My impresiion was that it was doubtful
if I should have another opportunity to
speak to him. As the poor old white-
haired man listened to the Word, seem-
ingly beaming with delight, I could not
help thinking of Simoon of old. The ca e
turned out, too, to be something like his.
for not long after he ? departed,? I trust,
in peace.
A House on a Round Hill.?
When I was over there Manambalea
and the junior chief took me up to a
beautiful little round hill, which they so'd
to me for an out-station. Manambalea
put up a grass house for me to sleep in
when I might be over there. I bought the
hill more to make the people feel that
I had a footing among them than that
I had a serious idea at that time to put
a house there. Little did I know that
hill was destined to be our home for over
three years.
The Chief and Karlsi.?
After I had been a year on Tongoa (my
second year in the Islands) it had been
arranged by the F.M. Committee in Otago
that I should go up to New Zealand.
When I was about to leave, Manambalea
asked me to allow Karisi, a young Chris-
tian Tongoan lad, to go home with him to
Selembanga. The young fellow was far
in advance of Manambalea in knowledge,
and was also a good singer. The day
after I returned from New Zealand they
came over not only to see me, but also
to bid my young wife welcome. We had
brought with us an American organ,
which added to the attraction. Our meet-
ing, of course, was very cordial. Manam-
balea told me how they had gathered
together the whole village every morning
and had had school under a large banyan
tree. On Sundays they first conducted
service at their own place, and then went
bn from village to village preaching the
Gospel.
Coast versus Bush.?
After he had gone away I learned that
there had been fighting on the island.
Lumbukuti village, on the west side, and
Selembanga, Manambalea?s village, on the
east side, had been fighting Pele, the
bush village in the middle of the island.
I was shocKed to learn that he had
allowed his people to join in the fight.
I sent for him, and a ked how he, a
Christian, could allow that. He then said
that tho'e bu-h people- were very bad,
and that the Gospel would never prosper
until they were ridded out 1 When I
made it clear to him that that was not
the kind of Gospel I had come to Tongoa
?with, he said, ? Well, I will go and stop

you can.?
