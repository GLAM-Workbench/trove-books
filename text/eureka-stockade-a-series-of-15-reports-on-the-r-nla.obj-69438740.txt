CLAIMS FOE COMPENSATION.
To Uis Excellency Sir Charles ITotham, K.C.8., Captain-General and Governor-in-Chief
of the Colony of Victoria.
Ballaarat, 27tli August, 1855.
May it please Your Excellency?
I do myself the honor of bringing under your Excellency?s notice the fact that some time
after the late disturbances at Ballaarat, Mr. Patrick Curtain, at that time a licensed storekeeper
at Eureka, represented to the Commission appointed by your Excellency to enquire into that
affair, that he had suffered very severe losses, by having his store enclosed within the stockade
erected by the insurgents against his inclination, and which store, with all its contents, was burnt
down by the military and police after the capture of the place, the loss sustained by Mr. Curtain
amounting to between �l2OO and �lBOO.
Some time afterwards, Mr. Curtain forwarded to your Excellency a Petition, stating his
claims. The Petition was numerously and most respectably signed. Amongst other signatures
were those of Mr. Sherard, Resident Warden, and of Mr. Green, the Resident Gold Commis-
sioner. To that Petition Mr. Curtain has not hitherto been honored with an answer, and has
requested me to bring the subject again under the notice of your Excellency.
I have most respectfully, and at the same time most earnestly, to represent to your Excel-
lency, that a few weeks previous to the outbreak, Mr. Curtain had made up his mind to return
home, and had determined to sell off his stock-in-trade, and realize his other interests ) and, to
shew the poverty and hardships entailed upon himself and family by the destruction of his pro-
perty at Eureka, I may further state that some months previously he had purchased some
land in the suburbs of Ballaarat, and had paid more than one-half the purchase money, giving a
bill at six months date for the balance of the price, but when the acceptance arrived at maturity,
from his being reduced to poverty, he was unable to retire it. Judgment was obtained against
him, execution was taken, and the parties from whom he purchased the land, Dr. Silverman and
Mr. Wynne, bought it in themselves. Mr. Curtain has thus indirectly suffered from the burning
of his property, but of course has not made any claim for compensation on that account.
Mr. Curtain and family have, since the outbreak, suffered very great privations, but he has
full confidence that your Excellency?s favorable consideration of the justice of his claim will
shortly result in his obtaining adequate compensation.
I trust your Excellency will not consider it out of place for me to mention that I myself
am the party alluded to in the Ballaarat Times , of the 2nd December last, as having been some-
what roughly handled at the meeting held on Bakery Hill, on Wednesday, 29th November, which
meeting I twice attempted to address, in opposition to two of the resolutions then brought for-
ward ; but, to prevent all misunderstanding as to my motives in mentioning the circumstance, I
may state that I am at present engaged in mining operations, and that should my conduct on the
occasion alluded to be deemed by your Excellency deserving of approval, however much I
feel flattered by such distinguished approbation, I shall never attempt to found upon it any appli-
cation for your Excellency?s patronage on my own behalf; and this emboldens me the more freely
and earnestly to beg and urge, both as an act of gracious consideration and of strict justice, that
your Excellency will take a most generous view of the hardships sustained by the innocent
sufferers, and more particularly of those of my friend Mr. Curtain, who is very much respected
amongst the general and mining community here, and on whose behalf I am alone empowered to
address your Excellency. His case is one of peculiar hardship.
In conclusion, 1 have now the honor of respectfully requesting that your Excellency will
be pleased to cause a communication to be made to me, stating what determination your Excel-
lency may have come to regarding Mr. Curtain?s Petition.
Waiting your Excellency?s commands,
I have the honor to be,
Most respectfully,
Your Excellency?s, &c.,
(Signed) ALEXR. FRASER,
Scottish Attorney..
P.S. ?My address is at ?Fisher and Miller?s Bute and Arran Store, Specimen Hill,
Ballaarat.? As there are other parties of the same name on Ballaarat, I have respectfully to beg
that your Excellency will cause particular attention to be paid to the address.


The Petition of Patrick Curtain to His Excellency Sir Charles Hotham, Knight
Commander of the Most Honorable Order of the Bath, Lieutenant Governor of
Victoria, &c&c,
Ballaarat, 21st February, 1855.
May it Please Your Excellency?
I, Patrick Curtain, beg most respectfully to lay before your Excellency the great and ruinous
loss occasioned to me, in the entire destruction of my property on the fatal morning of the 3rd
December last, hoping your Excellency will be pleased to take into consideration a loss so
calamitous to myself and family, and grant me a fair recompense.
I beg to state I have been a storekeeper on the Eureka, and that I have regularly paid
the license for permission to keep a store. In the unhappy disturbances of December last, the
stockade was thrown up by the diggers close to my store (a circumstance which I could not
possibly prevent), and was burned to the ground on the morning of the 3rd. I was in the act
of removing my family to a distance at the time, when, on returning, I found my store burned
to the ground. Your Excellency will please to observe that, in the fright and hurry with which
myself and family left our store, we left all our property, to the dress we wore, behind us, little
expecting the military would destroy the store with its contents. AYe are in consequence
ruined, as all our industrial savings for years of hard labor were consumed.
I already submitted to the Commission of Enquiry appointed by your Excellency a state-
ment of the loss I had sustained, which amounted to One thousand two hundred and sixty-seven
pounds seven shillings and two-pence. Of the above amount, Eight hundred pounds were due to
creditors, who have, I believe, sent in a statement of the same to the Board of Enquiry. As I
feel assured the Commission of Enquiry will satisfy your Excellency of the justice of my petition,
I have every hope your Excellency will see the justice of indemnifying me for my ruined loss.
And I, as in duty bound, shall ever pray.
(Signed) PATRICK CURTAIN.
AYe, the undersigned, beg to subscribe our names to the foregoing statement, and pray
your Excellency will comply with the prayer of it. AYe believe that Patrick Curtain is an honest
and industrious man, and a faithful and loyal subject, and that the loss ho has sustained is most
undeserved.
[Here follow 48 signatures.]
To the Honorable the Commission of Enquiry.
Gentlemen,
I beg to lay before your Honorable Board the following case, whereby I am an undeserving
and a most severe sufferer, with the hope that you will be pleased to take into consideration the
heavy loss sustained by me in the late unhappy collision on the Eureka between the diggers and
the military.
The loss I have sustained in the burning of my store with all its contents is very great, as
will be shown by the appended list. My store lay within the stockade ; but your Honorable
Board will be pleased to observe that its being there could be no fault of mine, and if the military
or officers in command deemed it necessary to destroy my store I cannot withhold from saying,
and say it with all due deference, that compensation should be awarded me for the loss inflicted
undeservedly. I further beg to observe that I was in the act of removing my family when the
firing commenced; up to this I had remained within the stockade solely for the purpose of
protecting my property. On my return, after leaving my family in safety at a distance, I found
my store all in flames without a chance of saving anything.
I take the liberty of enclosing a list of the articles and value destroyed on me. AYith all
truth I can say this list could be considerably larger, independently of much household furniture
consumed at the same time ; in fact, such was the terror and hurry with which my family fled, that
they left behind them even their every-day dress.
I hope your Honorable Board will feel with me and obtain for me a just compensation for
the loss and damage I have sustained; and in return I will be, as in duty bound, your grateful
and respectful servant.
(Signed) PATRICK CURTAIN.

I cannot forbear from testifying to the good character of Patrick Curtain. A more sober,
orderly and industrious man we have not in our community. I do believe that Le would not
state anything as a truth which he knew to be otherwise.
(Signed) PATRICK SMYTH,

AYe, the undersigned storekeepers and diggers, do hereby bear testimony to the general
good character which Mr. Patrick Curtain has for integrity and orderly demeanour, and believe
that his property was most unjustly destroyed.

Gentlemen,
The above is the amount, as near as I can recollect, of damages sustained by me; there
were other goods Ido not recollect. My reason for knowing so much was thus : On the 22nd
of November last I took an inventory of all my stock, as being determined to put it up by public
auction. Hoping your Honorable Board will take into your kind consideration, and grant me
remuneration for the above losses, and by so doing, myself and family will be in duty-bound to
ever pray.

sixty-seven pounds seven shillings and two-pence sterling, was set fire to and destroyed, imme-

Sir,
I have been a digger in Ballaarat for the last two years. In the month of December last,
I was possessed of a tent situate on the Eureka; I put it up intentionally for my wife and seven
children, whom lam expecting out daily. About the end of August last, I went into the bush to
split timber, leaving my tent, furniture, clothing, cooking utensils, and sundry other articles,
amounting altogether in value to �129 45.; but when I returned, on the .third of December, for
a change of clothing, after an absence of more than nine weeks, what was my horror and dismay
when I found nothing but the charred remains of the comfortable home I had provided, as I fondly
hoped, for the reception of my wife and family, from whom I had been separated for more than
three years.
On enquiry I learned what had taken place, and that the police and soldiers had set fire to it I
I think it but just to myself to state to your Excellency, that I took no part in the disturb-
ances, but had been absent for weeks from Ballaarat at the time, and knew nothing of it until
after my return and found my home destroyed as before mentioned; of this I can produce most
satisfactory proof. I stated these facts to the Royal Commission of Enquiry.
I therefore trust your Excellency will be pleased to take my case into ycur consideration,
so that I may be saved from so serious a loss of the fruits of my hard earnings.
A line in reply, at your Excellency?s earliest convenience, will be esteemed a favor,
By your obedient Servant,

The Petition of Patrick Donoghue , of Ballaarat.
May it Please Your Excellency?
Your petitioner, while expressing his loyalty and respect, begs leave to say that his tent
and all therein contained were burned down on the 3rd day of December last.
Your petitioner both confidently and solemnly declares, that though his tent lay within
the space enclosed by the stockade, yet that he took no part, directly or indirectly, in the dis-
turbances that took place at the time.
Your petitioner estimates the loss he has sustained at the sum of one hundred and thirty
pounds; this he believes to be the true value of the property consumed upon him on that day.


Your petitioner most earnestly and hopefully appeals to your Excellency?s well known
consideration and humanity, and prays that justice be done to him, as the merits of his case
require.
Should your Excellency condescend to receive this petition, and order your petitioner to
oe indemnified for his exceeding great loss, he shall feel bound to be your Excellency?s very
humble and grateful servant.

The undersigned William Adams declareth that ho resided near to the Eureka Stockade *
that when the attack began, on the 3rd December, 1854, he, considering his life in danger, tried,
with his wife and child, to reach some more secure spot; that while so accompanied he was
wounded in three places, and then made prisoner and conveyed to the Camp and imprisoned.
That he was confined for more than a week in the Camp Hospital from his wounds, and that on
his release he found that he had sustained the following losses:?
� s. d.
Store burned, cost ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 54 0 0
Goods?tea, sugar, flour, drapery, &c. ... ... ... ... ... 700 0 o
Own and wife?s clothes and furniture ... ... ... ... ... 100 0 0
Money in store ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 79 0 0
Money on person when apprehended ... ... ... ... ... 4 10 0
�937 10 0
The above he considers to be a fair value of such property as he lost through the burning
of his store and his being made prisoner.
In addition to these actual losses he has sustained serious harm through the compelled
stoppage of his business as a general storekeeper.
That he had no hand in the late disturbance is proved from the fact, that after examination
at the police office here, he was discharged.
He prays your honorable Board of Enquiry to take his case into your careful consideration p
and as, in common justice, he is not to be held accountable for the deeds of other men, and should
not suffer for them, he hopes for a favorable answer.
And remains
Your most obedient humble servant,

The humble Petition of Michael Noonan, of Ballaarat , to His Excellency Sir CHARLES
Hotham, K.C.8., Lieutenant Governor of Victoria.
Sheweth?
That the said undersigned Michael Noonan did in the month of December last, 1854, keep
a general store on the Eureka, at Ballaarat, and that he duly, as by law required, took out and
held the requisite license for so doing.
That in the said month of December, the unfortunate and much regretted riots took place
on the Eureka, when your petitioner?s store was burnt, and his property, to the extent of about
eight hundred pounds worth in money and goods, totally destroyed. That the said store was
upwards of one hundred yards from the stockade, but was nevertheless set fire to and totally
destroyed by either the foot police or the mounted troopers, as affidavits sworn to by a witness, as
well as an affidavit of my own, will fully prove.
Your petitioner would here most respectfully remark, that the affidavits alluded to were
sworn and handed in to the Select Committee of the Gold Fields, appointed by your Excellency.
Your petitioner would further add, that the dire disaster which he has encountered, as
narrated above, has been all but ruinous to him?-that he is a peaceable and loyal subject of Her
Majesty and your Excellency?s Government?and that he never, either directly or indirectly,
joined in the unlawful rising and conduct of those who caused the deplorable events at Ballaarat;
and lastly, that your petitioner is a married man, with a family of five children totally dependant
on his industrious and unceasing industry.
Under these most unfortunate circumstances, your petitioner most humbly prays for com-
pensation at your Excellency?s hands, and will as in duty bound ever pray.
(Signed) MICHAEL NOONAN.
We, the undersigned, knowing the above statement to be correct, and believing Michael
Noonan to be a true and loyal subject, and not in any way connected with the riots which took
place, but, on the contrary, a peaceably disposed and hard-working man, hereby append our names
and join in his prayer for fair and equitable compensation for his heavy and ruinous loss.
(Signed) JOHN QUINN, and fifty-five others.
In my opinion, Mr. Michael Noonan is one of the most peaceably disposed and industrious
men in our community here at Ballaarat.
(Signed) PATK. SMYTH, Ptest. Cath. Priest.
This is to certify, that Michael Noonan, general storekeeper, Eureka, Ballaarat, to the
best of our knowledge and belief, was in no way concerned in the late outbreak at Eureka, having
neither himself been drilled, nor did he drill others to oppose Her Majesty?s forces and the con-
stituted authorities, nor was he found with arms in his possession on the occasion of his store
being burned down, by which he, his wife, and five children, were thrown destitute on the
world.
(Signed) GEO. GUMMING, storekeeper, Eureka, and 14 others.

ceased and the military were retreating from the stockade on the Eureka, which they had just
taken, both of my tents, situated one distant twenty-seven, and the other twenty-one yards from
the said stockade, were wilfully and maliciously fired, burnt down, and consumed, with the whole
ot the contents, by the troopers, who deliberately lit matches and applied them to the tents for that

the scene of action : I do also solemnly and sincerely declare that the value of the property

when so consumed by the troopers. And I solemnly and sincerely declare that I had neither hand,

The humble Memorial of Thomas Allen ,
ShEWETH - "
That he has served on the Camp at Ballaarat six months, that he bears the character of a
sober, steady, honest man, and a loyal subject of Her Majesty the Queen, that during his time on
the Camp he had saved the whole of his pay for the purpose of entering into a little business on
his own account, he being a man verging upon sixty years of age and an old Waterloo soldier ;
moreover he wishing to return to England as speedily as possible, he took a place called the
� Waterloo Coffee House,? which he securely fastened and went to Melbourne to purchase a load
of goods. When the dray arrived within a few yards of his residence it was stopped by the rebels
and searched, and a beautiful gun stolen therefrom ) they then let it pass to my tent. On arriving
there I found the interior almost all destroyed by the rebels from Creswick?s Creek, who had
arrived the night before j I then unloaded my goods, which cost ,�llO in Melbourne j I had not
been more than two hours in the place when several of the mob tried to force me to join them
and thrust a pike into my hand, which I indignantly threw down, telling them if I had one
hundred soldiers at my command I would drive them all to h I then was instantly seized
by three rebels, by an order of an officer, and made a prisoner in my own after which I
escaped in disguise through the back part of my tent, and came to the Camp with all possible
despatch, and was the first to inform Captain Evans that they were raising barricades. In the
dusk of the evening I crept back again to my tent in the same manner I had left it, the
sentries being still at my door appeared not to have missed me. I was laying on my bed the
following morning, when the balls were whistling over my head and under my bed, my place set
fire to and burnt to the ground. My loss I sustained was one dray load of goods, value �IHJ;
one tent 20 feet by 12, two tables, two benches, one counter, value �4O ; one tent, 14 feet by 10,
value �5 ; amounting in all to �155. With all due reverence humbly begging your intercession

I, Thomas Allen, lately residing at the Eureka, Ballaarat, in the Colony of Victoria, store-

declare, that my tent, which was situate in the stockade at the Eureka, together with my
property, of the value of one hundred and fifty-five pounds, was, on Sunday morning, the third
day of December instant, entirely consumed by fire during the attack made by the military and
police on that day; that the property thus destroyed was only a short time before purchased by
me in Melbourne; that on my return from thence, on the day previous, I was seized and
threatened by the rioters if I did not join their ranks, and my tent was ransacked. I further
solemnly declare, that I took no part with the rioters in any way ; that I was forcibly detained
by them against my will; that I was in my bed when the attack on the stockade was made, and
that I narrowly escaped with my life; that I am nearly sixty years of age, and the loss I have
sustained has rendered me almost destitute. I fought at the battle of Waterloo, and at four
other previous engagements, but I receive no pension for my services. And I make this solemn
declaration, conscientiously believing the same to be true, and by virtue of the provisions of an

I understand there is a Superintendent of out-door labor for your Union now vacant.
Thomas Allen has applied for it on behalf of himself and wife. I cannot do otherwise than fully
recommend him : he is active and trustworthy; he has seen more prosperous days. If you can
assist him I shall consider it as a favor.

Gentlemen,
Mr. Thomas Allen informs me that he is applying for the situation of Superintendent of
out-door labor for himself and wife. This is to say, that having known Allen for some time past,
I of opinion a. more suitable couple could scarcely be found. Although their age may
be objected to, I think them equally active to many that are their juniors by twenty years, and
shall be very glad if the Guardians decide to appoint them.
Gentlemen,
Yours most respectfully,
J. NEILL.


In the matter of Thomas Allen, a claimant for compensation for losses
sustained by the riots at Ballaarat.?Secondary Evidence extracted
from the Melbourne Argus of March 20th, 21st, and 22nd, 1855.
Supreme Court, 19th March, 1855.
Before the Honorable Mr. Justice Barry.
Thomas Allen sworn?l have been a soldier, and was at Waterloo; I was in the police
force a short time at Ballaarat; I went away about ten days before the row, so returned just in
time to see about forty men with pikes being drilled; I heard military words of command given;
the pikes were headed with iron spear heads ; they marched for about three hours before my
tent; they were ordered to 1 receive cavalry,? they did it very awkwardly; I saw some musketeers
being drilled; a man put a pike into my hand and asked me to join them, but I refused; I after-
words entered into conversation with the captain of the musket party, I asked him what bountv
he gave, and he asked me what I meant, I said �5O was little enough for an old Waterloo man ;
I was only chaffing with him; he ordered me to be taken prisoner, and I was conveyed to my tent
by two pikemen ; they asked me to drill with them before they took me; I went to bed soon
after, and next morning about daybreak was aroused by the cry, 1 Stand to your arms,? several
times repeated; I then heard three shots fired, and then a volley, which I judged to be from the
military; my boots were shot through ; there were about five hundred men in the stockade, all
armed with some sort of weapon?guns, pikes, and revolvers; I imagine that some of these five
hundred men left the stockade during the night; I did not get out of bed until the firing was all
over; there were sentries posted round the stockade, inside and out, and I was thrust at with a
pike for attempting to get over the fence; there were no fires inside the stockade.?
By Mr. Ireland. ?? The police burned down my tent afterwards, but they never paid me for
it; I lost everything I had; this was after the firing had ceased; my tent, which was worth �45,
fetched 175.; afterwards, �2OO would not cover my loss, but I only sent in a bill for �155; the
police burned many other tents beside mine after the firing was over; I had been living some ten
months in the same spot; I cannot say how they set the tents on fire; I was taken away a
prisoner but discharged; I am kept a prisoner in Eichmond Barracks, and have been so for five
weeks; I have not been taken before any magistrate; I have twice required to be released, but
Captain McMahon told me I must not go away?
Re-examined?? All the tents that were fired were inside the stockade; I received 10s. 6d.
a day and received rations; the stockade was erected in three or four hours.?
March 21st.
Before Mr. Justice Barry.
Thomas Allen ?? The police destroyed everything I had in the world and left me
destitute; I frequently had but one meal a day since; I have not told the Government that, as I
am too proud.?
March 22nd.
Thomas Allen ?? Related the destruction of the Waterloo Coffee House, of which he was
