SOME ODD MEMORIES
OF THE
FIELD NATURALIST?S CLUB
JW S I sat by the fireside, my book on my knee,
Liu My memory foregathered that old company
IJL I had tramped with so often thro? forest and scrub,
Those friends of old time in the Bug-hunter?s Club.
There was Watkins could give you a joke or a pill,
Though both in effect made you dreadfully ill.
And Sankey who often your photograph took,
Though you never knew how you would afterwards look.
And Shirley who said he was such a good guide, ?
(You had only to try him to know that he lied).
And Oribb the star-gazer, and Griffiths the strong, ?
And German Steinberger, and Norton the long. ?


And Hedley who wasted his love upon slugs,?
And Grimes who sought fame by his beetles and bugs. /
Then our old friend the Doctor would these others mock,
And say he preferred to have spiders,?-and hook.
And Scott I remember was one of the staff
Of that lovely production our own ? Telegraph.?
And Sophy,?and Maggie,?what makes my eyes wet ?
How strongly it moves me to think of them yet.
And Chayter, you knew by his name he was true,
And of Joneses and Smiths we of course had a few.
And Simmonds so clever at climbing a tree? f J
Oh ! these were the boys of the old coterie.
Old Shirley had always a place to suggest, a V.
If you followed his leading you found a ? mare?s nest,? I, J ? * ,n - '
Or possibly found when you got to the place,
That of all vegetation there was not a trace.
He was very good natured, but look out for trouble !
When you mentioned the name of a stream called the Kobble.
And tho? his speech had a schoolmasterly flavour,
For its wide information ?twas always in favour.
When Watkins got married there was a to do,
For he kept it so dark that not one of us knew ?
Except by his looks, ?you could tell by his face,
In a bachelor sense, he had fallen from grace.
Yet he got o?er it sooner and belter than most,
And that old ice-machine gave out many a toast,
As the boys wished him luck, and made fun immense,
But he only smiled softly,?and raked in the pence.


And Sankey once brought out an instrument rare,
To tell to an inch where you stood in the air ;
A broken down thing that he brought from the shop,
Which he?d sell to you quick if you wer?n?t on the hop.
It had so often measured the height above sea,
It had broken its ? innards ? and gone up a tree.
We thought that if ? Annie ? had climbed up the track,
With a shortness of wind, and a pain in her back,
She?d account for the few hundred feet she was out,
And her figures would not be so open to doubt.
And then there was Griffiths, at once you could see
He knew something extra about every tree,
And if he was non-plussed, to save you from worries,
He would always come in with the name microoorys.?
Old Grif. was the strongest in wind and in limb,
So all extra parcels we laid upon him.
And such his good-nature, he seemed to delight
To carry that baggage from morning till night.
And Norton would always come out with a gun,
But to judge from results it was only for fun;
He said those plant-hunters were such a queer lot,
They drove any game many miles from the spot,
And the row that they made would make Nimrod despair,
And the hungriest man-eater keep to his lair.
Still must I confess it, the question is moot,
As to whether he really did know how to shoot.


And then there?s the comet of Mount Tambourine,
That two of the company only have seen;
?Twas Shirley yon know, that famous joke-getter,
A fellow who certainly should have known better,
Who got two young innocents out in the morning,
To see what a tail was that comet adorning.
As they gazed long and earnestly into the sky,
And thought of the bed they had left?with a sigh,
He said with a laugh that he could not contain,
? Its the first day of April and you?re had again.?
Though there streams from that comet a humorous tale,
Yet those two cannot see it, and think the joke stale ;
And yet I am rather inclined to their view,
Tor I?m sorry to say I was one of the two.
How well I remember the day that we tried
The effect on a man if a lady should guide ;
Her husband had said we could trust ourselves with her
She had practised so constantly on the Scotch heather.
But the wrath of Roth rose and he looked very grim,
When the funny man asked if she?d practised on him.
So we followed her closely for many a mile,
In the grace of her presence and light of her smile,
Tho? we all grew more doubtful as onward we pushed,
?Till at last she confessed she was thoroughly bushed.
And then our Professor stepped out in the van,
And showed it was best to be guided by man.
Though I think tho poor married ones said it in vain,
We all vowed that no lady should lead us again,


And we?re always prepared to give evidence sound,
Of tlie power in a lady to lead you right round.
Then Gadd once came out with some implements queer,
On the uses of which he was not very clear,
But ho left pretty plainly the mark of his tracks,
By the work that he did with a saw and an axe,
And besides a few bags of good firewood to burn,
Ho brought home a truck-load of orchids and fern.
And yet I have still the best man to recall,
?Twas he was the centre and life of us all,
Our kindly Professor, and Leader and Priend,
Whose knowledge and wisdom appeared without end;
There was nothing in botany that you could mention,
Which had not received his most special attention.
Yet his time and his talents were given unsought,
To any who shewed that they wished to be taught,
Tho? you asked the same question a dozen times o?er,
He would answer as though he?d not heard it before ;
And strange the request you would find unavailing,
For his kindness and patience were always unfailing.
May all our good wishes come true to him daily,
The Plant-hunter?s Chief! our best friend P. M. Bailey.
But ?twas after a prosperous day had been spent,
In a crowded conveyance, as homeward we went,
That we found there was only one thing to excel
His love for his science,?but love for a smell!


It was thus that the curious secret leaked out,
And the question was settled beyond any doubt, ?
Our leader had gathered a specimen rare,
Which if judged from the windward was thought to be fair.
It possessed a long name which nobody spells,
And also had one of the vilest of smells;
As that lovely aroma was jolted around,
He began to address us on what he had found.
He thought ?twas at least a new ? Bicty-o-phora,?
But we all of us thought we had got a plethora,
Mr. Bailey may call it what species he thinks,
We know it has got all the species of stinks;
I am certain if he had brought the thing out,
?Twould have settled the species beyond any doubt.?
A green, sickly light broke out on our faces
As we changed in our hue, we would try change of places.
And yet in the midst of it all he could sit,
And seemed to begin to enjoy it, ?a bit;
But ?twas really too hard, and unfeeling to smile,
When all of the rest had a feeling of bile.
Then the horses grew restless, the driver looked queer,
And asked if he migh?n?t get down for a beer.
And still as those vapours spread wide, and grew stronger,
The passengers found they could stand it no longer,
They asked for their fares, and stepped out one by one,
Until our Professor was left quite alone.?
We had known his devotion to science, quite well,
Now we know just as surely, his love for a smell.


Now let us change our metre to a more heroic measure,
As we try to chant the glory of those spec-i-ally few,
Who?re embalmed among the heroes we botanioally treasure,
And the world would do so also if it really only knew.
But the world knows really nothing, so we think it only right,
We should tell of some new species that our Club has brought
to light. ?
When our first new plant was captured, we all were most enrap-
tured,
And our leader quite belaboured, as to whose name should be
favoured.
Then ?Begone!? replied our leader, ?I have really got no
option,
?Though its hardly the most suitable, or best for my adoption.
? This man has so little honour, we must make that little plainer,
? ?Tis a species of Cupania, and I?ve called it Shirleyana.?
But when we found a Ficus, Georgie got him on the sly,
Said, ?? I?ve got to be made famous, or I?ll know the reason whj r ,
? And tho? you?re a great Professor, you have only once to die
Mr. Bailey thought he?d better, ?so he called it Watkinsii.
The next we found we gathered round, and all called out ?Indeed!?
? You?ve only got one name to suit that ugly little weed
?He?ll not be much the gainer, tho? perhaps a little vainer, ?
So its first name is Psychotria, and its next Simmondsiana.
MThen the doctor found that Georgie could an old Professor bluff,
Then he began to argue that it was not good enough ;
But we quite cured his disorder, with a plant of soapy order,
And also shewed that virtue can be still its own rewarder. .
So our friend the German doctor on his arms has placed a tree,
With ? Nephelium Lauteriana of the order Sapin-daoese.?


But alas! the heroic fails, and a sadness great prevails,
As the lingering pictures vanish and the lonliness assails ;
But the scenes can never perish, while the memory still can cherish
And recall the old excursions with an ever added relish.
So we give a smile contemptuous, when men call science dry,
And if we don?t quite say it, think he ought to go and die ;
Though he?d understand our smile, if he?d been with us a while,
And had known our old Professor, and a true bug-hunter?s style.
To combat this common error, we still try within our measure,
And can prove that all our journeys were unmitigated pleasure.
On our words place all reliance,- ?If you want to study science,
Join a club with our Professor, ?and set dullness at defiance.
July, 1893.
