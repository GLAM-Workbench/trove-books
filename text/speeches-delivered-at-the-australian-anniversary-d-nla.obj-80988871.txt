ANNIVERSARY DINNER.
As SOON as the Cloth was removed the Chairman,
Sir Charles Nicholson, rose and said, ?
?My Lords and Gentlemen : In proposing the
health of Her Majesty, it would he impossible for
me to say anything calculated to augment en-
thusiasm with which this toast is invariably received
in every assembly of Englishmen, and, I may add,
in every assembly of Australians; for in no part of
Her Majesty?s wide-spread dominions are her person
and government held in greater affection or esteem
(hear, hear) ?by none are those princely qualities
which adorn her character as a sovereign, or those
virtues which illustrate her private life, held in
greater reverence or more affectionate regard than
by her Australian subjects. Gentlemen, I ask you
to drink, with the same loyal enthusiam you have
ever been wont to do when 16,000 miles away,
the health of Her Most Gracious Majesty the
Queen. (Cheers.)
The toast was received with enthusiastic plaudits.
The Chairman. ?My Lords and Gentlemen: The
next toast which I have to propose is the health of
His Royal Highness the Prince Consort, the Prince
of Wales, and the rest of the Royal Family. This
toasQ I am sure, will meet with your loyal ac-
ceptance, standing in the relation in which it does
to our beloved Sovereign. His Royal Highness is
entitled, on all occasions, to our loyal regard and
respect. The Prince Consort has, however, other
claims upon our homage, irrespective of those de-


rived from his position as the husband of our Queen,
and the father of a race of sovereigns, who, we
trust, may, for ages to come, sway the sceptre of
these realms. His Royal Highness has ever shewn
himself a most enlightened patron and promoter of
all that is calculated to improve the human cha-
racter in arts, in science, and in general polity.
(Hear, hear.) Amongst the varied objects with
which His Eoyal Highness is conversant, I am ena-
bled to state, from personal experience, that the
history, the present condition, and the future of the
Australian Colonies have occupied no unimportant
place; and that the Prince Consort possesses a de-
gree of information on the economic, the educational,
and other resources of our Colonies, such as is ac-
quired by few persons who have not visited them.
(Cheers.) This is a circumstance which demands a
special recognition at our hands on an occasion like
the present. It would, my Lords and Gentlemen, be
impossible, at such a moment as this, to forego the
expression of our heartfelt sympathy in the fortunes
and future position of the illustrious lady, who, yes-
terday, became a royal bride, amidst the acclama-
tions of the whole British people?acclamations
which, however, will not be confined to these islands,
but will be re-echoed from the remotest corners of
the empire, from none more loudly or more heartily
than from the Colonies with which we have been so
long identified. (Cheers.) Of the princes that
now surround the throne, it is said that one is des-
tined for the naval profession. I trust that this
may be the case, and that Australia may, oner day,
be honored by the presence of some scion of the
Royal Family. Should such an event be realized, I
can safely promise, on the part of all Australian
Colonists, that he will receive a loyal and a cordial
welcome?(loud cheers) ?-one worthy of a son of the


Queen of England. My Lords and Gentlemen, I
give you, ? The Prince Consort, the Prince of
Wales, and the rest of the Eoyal Family.?
The toast was drunk with all the honors.
The Chairman. ?My Lords and Gentlemen: I
have now to propose to you,'? The Army and Navy.?
(Hear, hear.) The people of Australia heartily
sympathise in all the honor and glory won, as well
as in all the hardships and dangers experienced, by
the British arms. (Hear, hear.) During the late
campaign in the Crimea, the Attorney-General of
New South Wales proposed, in the event of the con-
test being continued, a resolution to the effect that
it would be the duty?as it, undoubtedly, would
have been the inclination?of the Colony to provide
a subsidy towards the carrying on of the war. The
Colonists will be ever ready to take their share in
any contest involving the honor and character of the
British race in any part of the globe. (Hear, hear.)
When Her Majesty?s letter reached us, inviting our
aid towards the Patriotic Fund, a generous response
was awakened to her appeal throughout the whole of
those Colonies; and New South Wales, alone, con-
tributed a sum of upwards of �70,000 to that fund.
The Colonists feel a special debt of gratitude to the
British Navy, which has produced so many illus-
trious navigators and nautical disco vereis, amongst
whom was the immortal Cooke, who may be sMd
to have been the first founder of these Colonies.
(Cheers.) Gentlemen, I give you, ? The Army and
Navy.? (Cheers.)
The toast was received with much applause.
General Cumberland returned thanks on behalf
of the Army, and Lord Amelius Beauclerk on
behalf of the Navy. ~ n .
The Chairman then rose and said ?Gentlemen:
Those who had the arrangement of the details of


this Festival did not, at first, intend that it should
assume its present aspect and character. They
simply desired that it should he regarded as a social
gathering of the Colonists now in London. In all
the Australian Colonies we have our political dif-
ferences and distinctions, about which we agree to
differ. But in this country we have no political
creed, except that of a loyal and undivided allegiance
to Her Majesty the Queen, and our respect for all
her constituted Ministers and constitutional advisers.
That is our political creed, as Colonists, in England;
as it is also our political creed, as subjects of a
widely-extended empire, in our several Colonies. It
was, however, suggested to the Committee that they
should solicit the honor of the company of gentlemen
distinguished in political life as also in the various
walks of science, who had manifested a lively in-
terest in the welfare of the Australian Colonies.
(Hear, hear.) Our invitation, I rejoice to say, has
been kindly responded to; and our festive board is
this day graced with the presence of several emi-
nent statesmen. (Hear, hear.) lam proud to see
amongst us the Eight Hon. Mr. Labouchere, the
present head of the Colonial Department; the Right
Hon. Mr. Gladstone; Sir John Fakington; the Right
Hon. Evelyn Denison, Speaker of the House of
Commons; and others. (Cheers.) I cannot refrain
from also mentioning the name of Sir Roderick
Murchison, ?(hear, hear) ?to whom the Australian
Colonies owe no small acknowledgment for having
been the first to predict, by scientific induction, the
existence of gold in those territories. (Hear, hear.)
If those predictions had been attended to, they
would, in all probability, have led to the working
of the gold-fields much earlier than was actually the
case. In passing to the toast which lam about to
propose, I feel bound to express our warm acknow-


ledgments to the right honorable gentleman, the
Secretary of State for the Colonies, for the ability,
urbanity, and kindness which have uniformly cha-
racterized his official conduct. (Cheers.) lam
persuaded, gentlemen, that it is impossible for any
one to hold any official intercourse with that right
honorable gentleman without coming to the con-
viction that he is actuated by an earnest desire to do
his duty to his Sovereign, and to the various Colo-
nies over which he presides. (Loud cheers.) Gen-
tlemen, without further preface, I give you, ? The
health of the Right Hon. H. Labouchere, and the
rest of Her Majesty?s Ministers.?
The toast was drunk with all the honors.
Mr. Labouchere then rose and said?Sir Charles
and Gentlemen: Allow me to return you my most
sincere thanks for the honor you have done to Hen'
Majesty?s Ministers in drinking their health. The
task of administering the affairs of a country like
this is, at all times, a heavy burden; and, certainly,
the times in which we live form no exception to that
rule. On the part of Her Majesty?s Government,
I can only say that they are fully conscious they can
discharge the great duties imposed upon them, either
with honor to themselves or advantage to the nation,
only so long as they shall receive the support and
retain the confidence of the great body of the intel-
ligence and independence of the country. (Cheers.)
It is to me a gratification of no ordinary kind to
have the opportunity of attending a banquet like
this, where I can meet so large a number of gentle-
men interested in some of the greatest, noblest, and
most important of the British Colonies; and also of
myself assuring you of the deep sympathy I feel in
the objects which have brought you together. (Hear,
hear.) There have been times, doubtless, when the
relations between the Colonial Office and the Aus-


tralian Colonies were not altogether of an amicable
or harmonious description. Ido not wish to go
back to those times. (Hear, hear, and laughter.)
But sure I am that for the state of things which
formerly prevailed, the fault did not lie with indi-
vidual ministers. Those ministers were, I believe,
many of them men of the highest ability, and I am
sure they were all men of honest and patriotic in-
tentions, But the truth is, the system with which
they had to deal was one under which no man could
satisfactorily perform his duties. The Colonial
Minister was required to manage the affairs of com-
munities removed from him by almost half the cir-
cumference of the globe,?those affairs, too, being
the affairs of a people naturally jealous of their
liberties, naturally proud of their independence,
naturally critical as to the manner in which they
were governed. Was it surprising then, that,
even with the best intentions in the world, mis-
apprehensions and disputes ensued, followed by
frequent delays and complications, and ending, as a
natural consequence, in discontent and heartburnings
on the part of the Colonists? Now, however, we
have changed all that. We have adopted a much
simpler and, as I believe, a wiser course, viz., that
in order to govern the Colonies well, it is necessary
to govern them very little. (Hear, hear, and a
laugh.) We have determined to leave the Colonists
the management of their own concerns, confident
that they will manage them much more wisely, or, at
any rate, much more to their own satisfaction. I
cannot say that they have not made mistakes. If
they have not, all I can say is, they are far more
fortunate than any other human government. (A
laugh.) Perhaps they are rather too prone to
changes of administration. I hardly ever open an
Australian despatch without finding the Governor


telling me that he is in the midst of a ministerial
crisis, ?that he has just parted with one set of
advisers, and is looking out for another. (Laughter.)
I believe, however, that all these things will right
themselves, and that, under free institutions and
responsible government, the Australian Colonies will
prosper. For myself, whilst I have had the honor to
hold the seals of the Colonial Office, I have endea-
voured to act up to the spirit of those free insti-
tutions, for I am persuaded that no greater mistake
could be made than to grant responsible government
to any Colony, and then not give that government
fair play,?and not to act frankly up to that con-
cession. It is but just to say that I have found
excellent coadjutors in working out that policy in
the able men who are now the Governors of our
Australian Colonies. I think it a most fortunate
circumstance that, in inaugurating the principles of
responsible government, two of our most considerable
Colonies should have had the advantage of the
superintendence of two such men as Sir "William
Denison for New South Wales, and Sir Henry
Barkly for Victoria. (Cheers.) Among the most
important powers of a Colonial Minister, is that of
recommending to the Sovereign men to fill the post
of Governor.' The only Governorship in one of
these Colonies which has become vacant since I have
had the honor of holding my present office, was the
Governorship of Victoria; and I had the greatest
satisfaction in being enabled to recommend to the
Crown the name of Sir Henry Barkly, than whom
it was impossible to find a man better fitted by
experience, temper, and judgment for such an office.
(Cheers.) I pass now to a toast which possesses
a far higher and more enduring interest than the
fate of any Ministry, or the reputation of any
Governor, ?I mean, ? Prosperity to the Australian


Colonies.? (Cheers.) In order to join most heartily
in this sentiment, it is not necessary to be connected
with Australia by the ties of property or trade. It
is enough to be an Englishman to take the warmest
interest in the welfare of a country whose future
fortunes are, we trust, indissolubly connected with our
own. (Hear, hear.) In the first place, those Colonies
are peopled by our own race?by our own children.
In the next place, those commercial ties Avhich are so
powerful in connecting lands so widely separated by
nature, are of the strongest and most beneficial
description. These Colonies send us their agri-
cultural and their mineral productions, and we send
them in exchange our manufactures and our emi-
grants. One class of emigrants, indeed, have not
of late been very readily received?those, I mean,
who ? leave their country for their country?s good.?
(Laughter.) Happily, however, that source of
discord has now ceased, ?I trust, for ever. No
minister, I am convinced, will hereafter send a
convict to an Australian or to any other Colony that
is not perfectly willing to receive him. (Cheers.)
The rapid development of our Australian Colonies
will fill one of the most marvellous pages in history.
On this very day, seventy years ago, a few English-
men planted the British flag in Sydney Cove, and
now the fine country of which they laid the germ
has expanded until it numbers a population of
800,000 souls. I believe the day is not far distant
when, instead of hundreds of thousands, that popu-
lation will be counted by millions. (Hear, hear.)
Not only have these Colonies advanced in material
wealth, but they have made a noble and virtuous use
of their riches, and have established institutions for
the promotion of religion, literature, science, and
education which would do honor to the oldest king-
doms. (Hear, hear.) As an example of this, I


may mention the Sydney University, which is calcu-
lated to afford a high standard of education for the
youth of that Colony. Mainly through the exertions
of your excellent Chairman, a Royal Charter has, I
am happy to say, been obtained for that institution
a Charter which, I trust, will tend to bind the
Colony closely to the Mother Country, and form one
of the many links that will unite them, I trust, for
ever. (Cheers.) Gentlemen, I shall conclude by
giving you, ? Prosperity to the Australian Colonies,?
coupling with that toast the health of Sir Charles
Nicholson, one of the most distinguished public men,
as well as one of the best citizens, that Australia has
produced. (Loud cheers.)
The toast was received with the utmost cordiality.
The Chairman, who was received with general
cheers, then said?My Lords and Gentlemen: I have
to return you my most heartfelt thanks for the honor
you have done me in drinking my health in con-
nection with the toast which the right honorable
gentleman has so eloquently introduced. I can
assure you it affords me the greatest pride and gra-
tification to preside over this commemorative fes-
tival. This is the seventieth anniversary of the
foundation of the first of the Australian settlements
of the landing of a handful of Englishmen on the
shores of New South Wales; for it was on the 26th
of January, 1788, that the first party of emigrants
reached the eastern coast of the Colony. Comparing
its condition then with the present stage of its de-
velopment, the history of the world furnishes no
parallel to its growth. The acquisitions of its first
settlers ?their number not exceeding a few score
souls were a few square miles of seaboard. Now,
its population ?not much short of a million?is
spread over a range of country extending from
2,000 to 3,000 miles. (Plear, hear.) Indeed, there


are now still living persons who remember the foun-
dation of its most advanced towns, who recollect the
period when its greatest settlements consisted of a
few miserable bark huts. Now, those Colonies boast
of four great cities, the capitals of important pro-
vinces. Melbourne contains a population of upwards
of 100,000 (hear) ?Sydney, 80,000 ?(hear, hear)
and Hobart Town and Adelaide have increased in
a corresponding ratio; whilst in every direction
throughout the interior flourishing villages are
and townships rapidly rising. (Cheers.) In the
principal cities buildings are to be found, which,
in point of architectural design, would be an orna-
ment to any capital in Europe. There are churches,
colleges, cathedrals, schools, theatres, shops, and
warehouses which might vie with many to be found
m the greatest cities of the Old World. (Hear,
hear.) All this has been created within the short
space allotted to one human life?threescore-years-
and-ten; and, therefore, those to whose energy, and
self-denial, and perseverance it is owing, feel some
degree of pride in the achievement. (Cheers.) In
early ages, the men who founded empires, or con-
quered them by the sword, were regarded as heroes
and demigods; and, surely, the foundation of modern
communities, in which commerce and the arts of
peace flourish, as they do under the Anglo-Saxon
race in the Southern hemisphere, is a work which
has something in it of a character truly heroic, and
worthy the highest ambition. (Cheers.) I will not
dilate upon the boundless natural resources and
pioductive capacities of these magnificent countries
faither than to say, that they are blest with a
climate and a soil capable of rewarding the culti-
vator with the products alike of the tropics and the
temperate zone products which, in their infinite
diversity, comprise the articles of cotton, coffee,


sugar, grapes, and olives; not to enumerate its
mineral wealth, or that wool which is already cele-
brated in all the European markets. Australia, too,
affords an inexhaustible field for emigration, offering
ready and remunerative employment to all who can
turn their hands to useful labour. (Cheers.) In-
deed, it may be said that Australia holds the same
position towards England as the Indies and South
America held towards Old Spain. Happily, however,
the parallel here ceases. Spain acquired her Colo-
nies by fraud and bloodshed, and retained them by a
cold and heartless despotism. Our Colonies have,
on the contrary, been founded in a spirit of phi-
lanthropy and enlightened enterprize. In that
measure of freedom which has been so ungrudgingly
accorded us by the Parliament of England we feel
that, as citizens and subjects, we are connected by
the indissoluble bond of one common allegiance,
loyalty, and affection to the glorious empire of
which we are members. (Cheers.) Gentlemen, I
have again to thank you for the honor you have
conferred upon me.
Mr. Edward Hamilton then rose and said?
Gentlemen: The toast I am about to propose is one
that must meet with a cordial acceptance from all
British subjects, especially from a body of Colonists
whose rights to the British constitution have been
acknowledged and conceded within the last two
years, and who are here assembled to celebrate the
day on which the standard of British Government
was first planted on an unknown land in the southern
hemisphere. I name the House of Lords, as the
descendants of those great barons who wrung Magna
Charta from an aggressive Monarch, and who were
then emphatically called the conservators of the
great liberties of England; and I name the present
House of Commons as the assertors of those prim


ciples, of which the levying of ship-money was the
fatal violation, and the Bill of Rights the crowning
triumph. Gentlemen, may I not say on your
behalf to the members of that Honorable House
who have honored us with their company this even-
ing, that the struggles of their ancestors for liberty,
their fortitude under oppression, their moderation
in the hour of victory, and their muscular eloquence
in debate are ? familiar as household words ? in
the Southern hemisphere? May I not assure the
Right Honorable the Speaker of the House of
Commons, who is here present, that his rulings on
points of order, and the forms and precedents
of which he is the guardian and interpreter, are as
much respected in our Australian Council Chamber
as at St. Stephens??(hear, hear) ?and that there
the constitutional maxims of Fox and Russell are
habitually quoted; the commercial principles of Pitt
and Peel steadily enforced; and the liberal views
of Charles Buller on Colonial policy alfectionately
revered? (Loud cheers.) Gentlemen, there are also
here present two right honorable gentlemen who
have, ?at different times, been entrusted by Her
Majesty with the charge of her great Colonial em-
pire?one, the most eloquent statesman in England,
whose name will occupy a prominent place in the
future history of our times; the other, that Colonial
Secretary, whose conciliatory rule we all remember
with so much gratitude and respect. (Cheers.) I
am sure that those right honorable gentlemen will
tell you that their eyes are steadily fixed on the
working of the British constitution in the limited
societies of Australia, for they well know that the
destinies of England are intimately connected with
the vigorous growth of her Colonies; and though I
will not even hint at the possibility of England ever
falling into the decrepitude of old age, under which


free and despotic governments have alike passed
away, yet I will make bold to say that her exemption
from such a fate will be greatly secured by the
establishment among rising nations in distant parts
of the world of institutions congenial to her own,
and corresponding in energy and moderation to the
two great houses of the British Parliament. (Cheers.)
Gentlemen, I have the honor to name in connection
with this toast the Eight Honorable Lord Audley,
the Eight Honorable John Evelyn Denison, Speaker
of the House of Commons, first commoner of Great
Britain, a name well known and much respected in
two of the Australian Colonies. I also name the
Eight Honorable William Ewart Gladstone and the
Eight Honorable Sir J. Pakington, formerly Her
Majesty?s Secretaries of State for the Colonies.
Lord Audley briefly returned thanks for the
House of Lords.
Mr. Evelyn Denison, Speaker of the House of
Commons, then rose and said?Mr. Chairman and
Gentlemen: I cheerfully obey the call made upon
me, although I do not hold any express commission
for such a purpose, to acknowledge the compliment
you have paid to the House of Commons. The
House of Commons, the great organ of the national
will, is sensibly alive to all expression of public
sentiment, and it will know how to appreciate the
declared approval of such a company as is assembled
here to-day; some of whom regarding it from a
point of view near at hand, and some surveying it
from a distance, join, with one accord, in the meed of
approbation and respect. I have had great pleasure
in attending this meeting, and I return you my
grateful thanks for the invitation with which you
have honored me. I came here induced by feelings
both of a public and private nature; I rejoice, on
public grounds, to join with you in drinking, with


hearty good will, ? Prosperity to the Australian
Colonies,? and in expressing a hope that friendly
relations, and the intimate connection between the
two countries, may be long maintained, alike honor-
able and advantageous to both. My feelings are
enlisted also on private grounds, for I have near and
dear relatives whose lot has been cast in that, let me
say, not ungrateful land, and one of whom has
the distinguished honor of representing the Queen
in the important Colony of New South Wales.
(Hear, hear.) I knew that whether I met gentlemen
from Van Pieman?s Land or from New South Wales,
I should hear of him nothing but words of kindness,
a recognition of his desire to do his duty, to promote
the internal interests, and to elevate the moral cha-
racter of those over whom he has been called upon
to preside. (Cheers.) We have drunk, ?Prosperity
to the Australian Colonies??you have been reminded
by the Secretary of State that that prosperity is now
mainly in your own keeping ; that prosperity will,
in a great degree, depend on the course pursued by
the Australian Parliaments. You know very well ?
but none so well as our worthy Chairman?how
greatly the successful course of Parliaments depend on
the rules by which they are guided, and the order by
which they are governed. I was happy to hear from
Mr. Hamilton that the rules and orders of the House
of Commons are held in esteem in the Australian
Parliaments; and if I might venture to olfer one
word of advice I would say, as you have accepted
the British House of Commons as your model, accept
also, and holdfast by, its rules and orders. (Cheers.)
Do not be regardless of the traditions and experience of
six hundred years. You will have many temptations
to depart from those rules; you will often think you see
shorter roads towards obtaining the objects you may
have in view. There have been no public assemblies


in the world that have been able to resist the temp-
tations. The great Chamber of Deputies in France,
composed of able and enlightened men, and of
brilliant orators, was not able to resist those tempta-
tions. That Chamber granted power to the majority
to control and coerce the minority, and to check and
contract debates. lam sorry to say that our nearer
brethren on the other side of the Atlantic have
carried their encroachments still further?they have
established rules at Washington and in other State
Legislatures which not only go to contract debates,
but, on many important occasions, absolutely to
prohibit and repress them. It is not my province to
criticise the institutions of other countries, but I
may, perhaps, be permitted to point to these as pre-
cedents to be avoided, and as examples not to be
followed. Once more, therefore, I say stand by the
rules and orders of the House of Commons (cheers) ;
rules which give protection to the minority, which
conduce to moderation, and mutual forbearance, and
which have ever formed the great characteristic and
the leading distinction of our institutions. (Cheers.)
As I see on either side of me two distinguished
colleagues of mine in the House of Commons, whose
names have been associated with mine in this toast,
I will detain you no longer. I have confined my
observations rather to the professional or presidential
view, leaving to them, with satisfaction and con-
fidence, the wider field. (Cheers.)
At the conclusion of the speech the whole com-
pany rose and gave three cheers for the Speaker of
the House of Commons.
Mr. Gladstone next addressed the assembly.
The right honorable gentleman said: On all ordinary
occasions there cannot be a greater act of irregu-
larity and insubordination than for an individual
member of the House of Commons to presume to


utter a word after that House has spoken through
the mouth of its Speaker. (Laughter.) And such
is my veneration for the office of that gentleman, as
well as my regard for my right honorable friend who
tills it, that 1 really do not know what could have
induced me to break through those rules and orders
which he has exhorted you to observe at the other
end of the world, if he had not himself set a salu-
tary example of breaking through them on sufficient
occasion, by intimating in distinct terms, at the
close of his speech, that, although the House spoke
by its Speaker, it might yet also proceed to answer
your good wishes by the mouths of two among its
individual members. (Cheers.) Yet he, in as-
suming to himself the liberty of making an excep-
tion to the rules of the House of Commons, was not
less sincere and earnest in commending them to
general observance. Allow me, as one of his chil-
dren and subjects, to add that he was not less wise
and practical than he was sincere, in enforcing upon
you the belief that those rules and orders are misun-
derstood by such persons as apprehend them to be
matter of dry technicality;?that they embody the
matured wisdom and experience of centuries, and
constitute no small portion of what we mean when
we talk of the admirable advantages of the British
constitution. (Loud cheers.) Now, Sir, I feel con-
scious for myself of what better men may also fee],
namely, that it is an honor to be a member of that
assembly, just as it is an honor to that assembly itself
that it should not only be able to command the good-
will and confidence of those who are immediately
conversant with its proceedings, but likewise should
receive a witness such as you have borne to-night to
the fame it has acquired throughout the globe by
its ancient traditions, and by the, I trust, still
unimpaired vigour with which, after so lengthened


an existence, it still continues to walk in the
footsteps of the many generations of honored En-
glishmen that have gone before. (Cheers.) Gen-
tlemen, my right honorable friend the Secretary of
State has made his apology, his modest and just
apology for himself, and his liberal apology for those
who preceded him in holding the seals of his office.
But let me add, on behalf of the Monarchy and on
their behalf, that it was not a department of the
Executive Government only that at one time labored
under grievous error with respect to the true basis of
colonial policy. The Executive Government derived
its complexion from Parliament and from the country,
and gave effect to convictions which were those of the
legislature and the nation. Thus it only inherited
the last consequences of a wide-spread fallacy which,
until within the last half century, pervaded the mind
of all Europe as to the just mode of governing Colo-
nies. (Hear, hear.) It was not the fault of indi-
vidual Ministers of the Crown, it was the frailty of
human nature that led to errors in the government
of Colonies, which were corrected only by the sad
lessons of experience. How long was it thought, aye
firmly and undoubtingly believed, that commercial
monopoly was the proper ground of the relation
between the Mother Country and her Colonies, and
was the secret of wealth both for the one and the
other. This was the great and master error which
governed the foundation of every transatlantic empire
established since the first European navigator doubled
the Cape and explored the shores of a new world.
And nations have spent their treasure and their blood
in their endeavours to uphold principles which cramp
the energies and fetter the enterprize of growing
communities. (Cheers.) The struggle between Eng-
land and her American Colonies was an experience on
our side of principles common to us with all countries;


nor was it even immediately the fault of the Crown and
its advisers, hut of the representatives of the people,
who passed the Stamp Act, and imposed the obnoxious
Tea duties on the sturdy inhabitants of Boston. Man
is the heir of an imperfect understanding and a dis-
ordered nature. He must learn the road to that which
is good and true for the most part through suffering.
(Hear, hear.) It is that way that England has learnt
it; and it is credit enough and happiness enough for us,
the children of Adam, if we are able to say that we
have not despised the lessons which experience has
taught us, but have endeavoured to turn them
to account. (Cheers.) As regards the great ques-
tion of the principles upon which an ancient country
is to rear up her children in the remotest parts of
the globe, and as regards the modes and conditions
on which the waste places of the earth are to be
peopled and reclaimed from nature, I have no hesi-
tation in avowing my earnest conviction that it has
been given to England to work out that experiment,
not alone for her own good, but for the benefit of
mankind. (Loud cheering.) If England erred in
respect to her American Colonies, she erred in com-
mon with France, with Spain, and with every other
European nation having transmarine dependencies.
Now, however, that error?how happily for us all!
is no more; its very fragments have been happily scat-
tered to the winds, and there is established between
England and her Australian Colonies a connection,
not in figure and in metaphor only, but in truth and
in substance, ? founded in honor and interest, in
affection and good-will, and founded on nothing
else. (Cheers.) It is a connection which abhors
the very idea of force; but from this truth grave
consequences flow. The Colonists must remember
that they are now left, to a great extent, to govern
themselves; and that if their virtues are their


own, so also, yon will permit me to say, will be
their failings. (Hear, hear.) You have acquired
the powers and privileges, you have also come
under the responsibilities, of freedom. You have
the example of England before you, and as worthy
children of such a parent, I sincerely trust and
earnestly pray you may grow up in honor and pros-
perity. It is no light task which you have in your
hands as we have it in ours. It was the injunction
of the ancients to a son when he went out to war
not to be beneath the standard of his fathers. The
standard of our fathers is set full in our eyes, and
the ancient fame and character of England are no
light inheritance. (Hear, hear.) May you in
Australia and we at home be alike enabled to follow
the pattern that is before us, and to keep unspotted
the names of those who bequeathed it. (General
cheering.)
Sir John Pakington also responded to the toast.
The right honorable baronet said: Mr. Chairman and
Gentlemen, although Mr. Speaker has acknowledged
the compliment you have paid to the House of Com-
mons, and my Right Hon. friend, Mr. Gladstone, has
addressed you with his usual eloquence on Colonial
policy, I must beg leave to express my gratitude for
my share of the toast you have now been good enough
to drink. I wish to thank you for the kind manner
in which you have been pleased to receive my name.
I thank you for your attention in inviting me to this
very gratifying entertainment, and I thank you for
thus giving me an opportunity to become personally
acquainted with many gentlemen, connected with
Australia, whose names I have long known, and
whose abilities and public characters I have long
respected. So far, gentlemen, my task is easy; but
when I consider what I shall next say to you I
confess I feel much in the position (if I may speak in


sporting phrase) of a sportsman on the right of a
line out shooting, who knows when a bird rises on
the left, that he has no chance of a shot, unless all
his friends should miss it. (Laughter.) It is now
my unlucky turn to fire after my right honorable
friend, the Member for the University of Oxford,
and you know well that he is a gun that never misses
anything. (Renewed laughter and cheers.) But,
gentlemen, there is one thing left for me to say, and
though it has been said, and well said, before, I wish
to repeat it for myself. I wish to assure you that, as
an English citizen, as a Member of the House of
Commons, and as one who has had the honor of
being entrusted, even for a brief period, with the
administration of our Colonial Empire, I most
heartily join in ardent aspirations for the continued
prosperity of our Australian Colonies. (Cheers.)
Those Colonies have long been regarded with great
and growing interest by this country; but that
interest has been increased tenfold since those mar-
vellous discoveries of gold which have enabled the
Australians to contribute of late years, to an incal-
culable extent, to the welfare and prosperity of
themselves, their Mother Country, and the world.
There can, in my opinion, be little doubt that the
future welfare and success of those Colonies are
intimately bound uj) with a stedfast adherence to
that conciliatory policy which has recently been
pursued towards them by England. Aided, I trust,
in some degree by that conciliatory policy?aided by
the great discoveries to which I have referred?as
well as by the freedom of their institutions, and the
innate vigour of the British Character, the progress
of those Colonies has been rapid to an extent for
which nothing in the history of the world, even in
America, affords a parallel. Victoria is the most
remarkable instance of this progress. You are pro-


bably, most of you, aware of that remarkable fact in
the early history of Victoria, to which, I think, I
have before made public reference, but to which I
cannot refrain from now again adverting.?Scarcely
thirty years ago, when the present Earl of Aberdeen
held the Seals of the Colonial Department, a band of
adventurous Englishmen landed at Port Philip, and
liking the appearance of the country, sent home an
application to the Colonial Minister for permission
to found a Colony. The required permission was
refused on the ground that the Colonial Empire of
England was already sufficiently extensive. (Hear,
and a laugh.) I allude to this fact with no wish to
disparage the ability of Lord Aberdeen ; I would
rather adduce it as an additional proof, how subor-
dinate to a higher power is the sagacity of even the
most eminent statesman. Providentially Lord Aberr
deen?s refusal came too late; the distance was great,
and the time was long; and, meanwhile, the thing
was done. And there, on that spot where a living
statesman said no Colony should be founded, now
flourishes one of the finest dependencies of the British
Crown ?a dependency which, last year, raised a
revenue of �4,000,000, had an export and import
trade amounting to �30,000,000, is about to
expend �8,000,000 in the construction of rail-
ways, and, strangest and greatest of all, shipped
for" England no less than 100 tons of gold.
(Cheers.) Gentlemen, I believe the progress of
New South Wales, though, perhaps, not so rapid, has
been equally, if not even more, satisfactory. Long
may this prosperity continue, and long may it be
combined with that affectionate attachment to the
Mother Country which the Australians have always
evinced, and of which we have seen this day one
striking demonstration. (Cheers.) In connection with
this subject, I must be allowed to advert to that signal
b 3


proof of their loyalty and attachment to England,
which the Australian Colonies have recently afforded
by their generous contribution to the Patriotic Fund
for the relief of widows and orphans of officers and
soldiers who fell in our late war with Eussia. That
noble subscription has been alluded to this evening
by our worthy President; but it is my fortune to be
one of the Commissioners for the distribution of that
fund, and I am bound to say that in this respect Sir
Charles Nicholson has not done full justice to his
fellow Colonists. The total fund subscribed was, in
round figures, �1,500,000, and no less than one-
tenth of this sum was contributed by Australia.
The Australian subscription was, in round figures,
�150,000. (Loud cheers.) It may be said that Aus-
tralia is the land of gold, and that she ought to
subscribe largely; but this would be no answer to
my argument that this splendid subscription to such
an object is an honorable and gratifying proof of
their warm attachment to old England. (Hear,
hear.) Gentlemen, permit me, following up what
has just fallen from my right honorable friend, to
add one word more. We saw, yesterday, a fair
Princess of England leaving the happy home of her
youth, to take up her abode in a distant land, and
assume a position of independence; but still clinging
fondly to the recollections of her parental home; still
hoping to maintain, as long as life may last, constant
and affectionate intercourse with her father-land.
So, gentlemen, if the day should come, as in the
course of human events it probably may, though
I hope it may be distant?if the day, I say,
should come when the Australian Colonies may
feel that they are mature, and when England may
feel that her parental duty is fulfilled, ?if sepa-
ration should then take place, let it be a sepa-
ration of friendship and good feeling, and not the


unhappy result of a sanguinary struggle. (Hear,
hear.) I trust that the Parliament and the states-
men of England may conduce to constant good
feeling between the Colonies and the Mother Country
by always remembering the stock from which our
Colonists have sprung, and always respecting the
rights which, as Britons, they are sure to claim; and
that thus, whenever the relations of parent and
offspring shall cease, they may be succeeded by rela-
tions of honorable and friendly alliance, which,
without impairing mutual independence, may tend
to the lasting happiness and welfare of two great
countries. (Loud cheers.)
Lord Alfred Churchill said: In giving the
toast which it has fallen to my lot to propose, viz.,
?Prosperity to the gold-fields of Australia,? I feel
I must couple with it the name of Sir R. Murchison,
to whom was due the credit of having first foretold
its existence. During the last three hundred years
I cannot remember more than even half-a-dozen
great men who, by the force of their own intuitive
genius, had made discoveries having greater weight
upon the destinies of the world, and in ameliorating
the condition of mankind, than that of gold in the
Australian Colonies. In the earlier ages, as light
and intelligence were but beginning to dawn, the dis-
coveries of Galileo and Columbus, and, subsequently,
those of Harvey, Sir I. Newton, and Adams, might
each be quoted as instances of that genius which had
been severally followed by a great stride in the gene-
ral intelligence and material social progress of society;
but in these later days the discovery of gold might
be fairly said to have eclipsed the others in its happy
results. I trust that when the circumstance is
fully known, that honor will fairly be acceded to Sir
R. Murchison. Sir R. Murchison, in his earlier life,
had visited the gold districts of the Ural Mountains


in Russia, and had received many marks of distinct-
tion and honor from the Emperor of Russia for his
various researches in those districts. In 1844 he was
examining various mineralogical specimens shown
him by Count Strzelecki from the eastern portion of
Australia, when he was struck by their similarity to
those of the Ural Mountains and the general north
and south districts of the geological formation. In
consequence of this resemblance he read a paper be-
fore the Geographical Society in that year upon the
possible existence of gold in Australia. In 1846 he
was consulted by Sir C. Lemon for suggestions which
might tend to help the workmen, in his county
(Cornwall). Upon this Sir R. Murchison recom-
mended their emigrating for the purpose of seeking
for gold in the Australian drift, much in the same
way that they did for tin in their own country. In
1848 he received letters from tA?o individuals in Aus-
tralia, named Smith and Phillips, who, having heard
of his vaticinations, wrote to inform him that they
had actually discovered gold, and forwarded speci-
mens of quartz containing it. Sir R. Murchison
immediately brought the subject before the notice of
the Colonial Office, and instigated them to remove
the heavy restrictions which prevented any further
search for the precious metals. He knew what it is
to move the Colonial Office, and on this occasion they
fully bore out their character, and all Sir R. Murchi-
son?s endeavours were futile. Had it not been for
the discovery of gold in California, the question had
never again been opened. Honor to Hargreaves, who
first discovered a workable gold field ; but had Sir
R. Murchison?s vaticination been followed up, Aus-
tralia would have been a gold country in 1848, in-
stead of waiting for 1851. (Loud cheers.)
Sir Roderick Murchison then rose and said?
Sir Charles Nicholson, my Lords and Gentlemen :


Whilst I heartily thank you for the very high honor
you have done me in coupling my name with the
discovery of gold in Australia, it would ill become
me not to disclaim the over flattering compliments
which my noble young friend, Lord A. Churchill, has
paid me, and above all if I did not deprecate his
comparison of the prediction of a hard working
geologist, with some of the profoundest inductions of
the greatest philosophers. No, gentlemen, my story
is soon told, and is plain, short, and intelligible.
Whilst I am the last man who would snatch from
others their participation in the great event which
has raised your Colonies to their present pitch of
prosperity, I gratefully accept that amount of praise
which you may consider really due to my humble
efforts. In few words these efforts were: first, that
in 1844 I began to predicate the advent of Australian
gold; next, that in 1846 I publicly advocated the
search for it; third, that in 1848 I called the atten-
tion of the British Government to gold which had
then been discovered; and fourthly, that I published
these things, accompanied by various other writings,
in succeeding years, and that all this took place long
before the practical opening out of your mines in the
memorable year 1851. Let me, however, explain,
that never having been in Australia I could not have
formed my first hypothesis, had I not had the advan-
tage of seeing numerous rock specimens in the year
1844, which my distinguished friend Count Strzelecki
had brought home for the illustration of the excellent
work which he published in 1845, the result of several
years of the arduous researches of that intelligent
and high-minded man who explored the eastern range
of New South Wales, and followed the western bend
of that chain from his own Mount Kosciusko to Port
Philip, and even to Tasmania. Having then just
returned from an exploration of the Ural Mountains,


I could not avoid beiug struck with the similarity of
the chief rock masses of Australia to those of the
Siberian chain, and knowing that similar matrices
usually produce similar mineral substances, opined
that gold ought to be found in our Australian Colo-
nies, though it ?had not yet been discovered in them.?
At that time, (1844,) and long afterwards, I was
entirely ignorant of the existence of auriferous spe-
cimens in the Colonies; but being called upon in the
year 1846 by my esteemed friend Sir Charles Lemon,
the President of the Royal Geological Society of
Cornwall, to express my sentiments at a public meet-
iug at Penzance, and to suggest some method of
relieving the wants of the many Cornish miners who
were then out of work, I boldly urged those men
who were well acquainted with the processes of dig-
ging and washing tin ore, to emigrate to Australia,
and there extract gold from the superficial detritus of
that country, just as they found the tin ore at home!
Although my opinion (which was, it will be remem-
bered, expressed before the discovery of the Califor-
nian gold), made little impression on the general
public, and was scarcely known beyond scientific
circles, though printed in the Transactions of the
Geological Society of Cornwall; some Cornishmen
did emigrate to your Colonies. Other persons also
heard of my anticipations and advice, so that on my
return from a long exploration of the Alps and
Apenines in 1848 I perceived, by letters from Aus-
tralia, that I had already got some reputation there,
for two correspondents, a Mr. Smith and a Mr.
Phillips, both unknown to me, wrote to me of gold
being absolutely found, and even sent me small speci-
mens. Then it was that I deemed it my duty as a
well wisher to my country, at once to acquaint the
Secretary of the Colonies with the fact that what had
for four years been a theory in my mind, was realised?


(cheers) ?and that as in the tracts where some speci-
mens of gold existed much might he found, I begged
Her Majesty?s Government seriously to consider the
best and steadiest mode of developing this wealth, and
also to modify the mining laws. Ido not blame the
noble Earl Grey, who was then Colonial Minister, for
his opinion as a statesman, an opinion held by many
other eminent men, that the opening out of gold fields
might derange a pastoral population like that of
Australia, whose wealth and prosperity had been
raised upon sheep farming; but I simply record the
fact to show, that come what might I had done my
duty as a mining geologist who followed science for
its own sake, in announcing to my own Government,
not the theory of finding gold, but the absolute dis-
covery of that metal?a discovery which might
change not only the whole condition of Australia, but
probably the relations of the world. (Cheers.) As
this letter of mine lay unknown for five years in the
archives of the Colonial Office, and was not printed
until long after the practical opening out of the gold
fields, and the publication of huge blue books in
which my name was never mentioned, I requested
that the document might be printed, and the Duke of
Newcastle directed its publication to take place in
the last of those voluminous records on the subject.
You will then see how little my countrymen at home,
still less the Colonists, could be acquainted with my
doings, all of which, even the last, took place, I
repeat, long anterior to the practical opening out of
the great gold fields of New South Wales and Vic-
toria. After this brief explanation I think you will
admit that my anticipations and advice, whatever
they were worth, did not proceed from a Roderick
Random. (Cheers and a laugh.) Let me once more,
gentlemen, disclaim on my part the remotest desire
to derogate from the just claims of the persons who


have distinguished themselves as Australian gold
explorers; for after the subject burst upon the public
and became the daily food of our newspapers, other
persons (it was then for the first time announced,)
had discovered gold, but had never published the
facts. In this way it had remained entirely unknown
to me, and indeed to all scientific men in Europe,
that Count Strzelecki and the Rev. W. B. Clarke,
both valued friends of my own, had previously
broached the subject in letters to Colonists, &c. On
this head they have indeed both borne testimony,
that my inductions were drawn entirely irrespective
of any discoveries which they made, but had sup-
pressed, in deference to the Colonial Government. Let
each man of science have his due share in this great
event?(cheers) ?let the observations, writings, and
labours of Strzelecki, Clarke, and others, and the
practical workings of Hargreaves have each their well-
merited praise?Cheers?but I may be excused for
saying that if the British Government had acted on my
suggestions in 1848, I should certainly have obtained
long ago from the Colonies that acknowledgment
which you have this day accorded to me, and which
is the best reward a man of science can obtain at the
hands of his enlightened countrymen. In various
other publications on the subject of gold, also printed
before the practical workings began, I alluded to the
coining gold of Australia, whether in a lecture before
the Royal Institution, in a memoir read before the
British Association for the Advancement of Science,
or, finally, in the article ? Siberia and California ? of
the Quarterly Review of 1850. In those works I
was, indeed, so bold as to differ from distinguished
statists and statesmen who held opinions which, as
an observer of facts, I never could understand,
respecting the evil which it was supposed would
follow from a too great influx of gold. When I for-


merly speculated on a considerable increase of gold
from Siberia, and long before the Australian gold was
discovered, the illustrious Sir Robert Peel, for whose
memory I entertain a profound respect, expressed to
me by letter his hope ? that we might not have too
? much of a good thing.? Yet have we not seen how
the impoverished countries of Europe, which had no
metallic currency, have rapidly absorbed all our
superfluous gold, and do we not know how ardently
our merchants and bankers looked for a fresh supply
of that good thing ? (Loud cheers.) Nay, do we not
all feel how seasonable and providential was the arrival
of Australian gold during the recent panic. But I
must not wade beyond my depth; nor dare to contend
with those ingenious gentlemen?the political econo-
mists. I must indeed confess that I have perhaps
ventured somewhat too far in my estimate of the
natural limit or restriction of the supply of gold in
what I have called ? the Bank of Nature.? In
speculating on the future the naturalist has, how-
ever, but one safe course before him. He must judge
of what is to come by what has past; and as the
history of mining, from the time of Job to the pre-
sent period, has taught us that gold is on the whole
superficial, as regards the crust of the earth, and has
never been largely or profitably extracted except by
diggings in debris derived from the abrasion of rocks,
so the period has sooner or later invariably arrived
when each country that was auriferous has ceased to
be so. On the relation of silver to gold I still
maintain what I have always contended for, that
whilst gold is a superficial product whose veins
diminish and thin out downwards, silver being found
in the greatest abundance in the deeper seated lead-
bearing rocks, will in the long run maintain its old
relation to the more precious metal. Happily, indeed,
for Australia, her golden wealth exceeds anything ever


previously recorded?her troughs of broken auriferous
materials are richer than those of any country ever
explored, save parts of California; so that many years
will doubtless still elapse before this golden produce
is exhausted; and long before that time arrives the
continent of Australia will, I confidently prophecy,
contain the richest and most industrial colonists of
the British Crown, and that the inhabitants of all
classes in that fine country will continue to bless the
day when the gold fields were discovered. (Loud
cheers.)
Mr. E. Stephens said?My Lords, Mr. Chairman,
and Gentlemen: I confess not to be unaccustomed to
address my fellow-countrymen, especially in that
local Parliament where I had the honor of a seat;
yet I admit I feel placed in a different position
to-night. I now see around me not only the Right
Honorable Gentleman who presides over the Senate
of this great country, but distinguished members
of that house?gentlemen who may be said to have
ruled our Colonial destinies. (Hear, hear.) I hope
that these distinguished gentlemen who have honored
us with their presence to-night will not think the
Committee of this festival have singled me out as
the best selection that could be made in representing
the interesting and prosperous Colony with which
I have so long been connected. I must frankly
confess that far more eloquent speakers and more
distinguished Colonists I see around me, of whom
South Australia may justly be proud; though I as
frankly confess I do not yield to any one in warm
attachment to the Colonies, and devotion to their
best interests. The toast which I have to propose,
? The Governors and the Legislative Bodies of the
Australian Colonies,? embraces two most vital ele-
ments of our prosperity (Hear, hear.) So long as
good Governors rule or preside over a free and


enlightened people, such as we rejoice to know the
Australians eminently are and assuredly desire to be,
so long may we confidently rely upon the steady and
solid progress of what are justly termed the growing
empires of the South. At this unusually late hour
to which this pleasant u Federal Union ? has ex-
tended, I must be very brief. If ever there was a
period in our Colonial history when the wisdom, the
experience, the patriotism, and the prudence of the
people were placed under requisition, that period is
the present. Now that the great governing prin-
ciples of the British constitution have been brought
into action in Australia, it will be the Australians
alone who will bear the blame and suffer the con-
sequences if they do not make good use of the golden
opportunity now so eminently and gloriously their
own. But we know the men, Sir, and the spirit which
will actuate them in their deliberations upon the
points most vital in connection with their present and
future happiness; and we have the strongest confi-
dence that their decisions will be founded upon the
conscientious conviction that they are laying the
corner stones of an edifice which shall redound to
their glory, and to the prosperity of the thousands
of the toiling sons of Britain, who annually flock to
their shores to find a home and to found a name.
(Cheers.) I beg to couple with this toast the name
of Mr. Latrobe, late Governor of Victoria, and Mr.
W. M. Manning, late Member of the Assembly of
New South Wales.
At this late hour the reporter left, and no record has
been kept of the Speeches delivered by Messrs. Childers and
Archer, or of the acknowledgments in reply by Mr. Latrobe,
Mr. Manning, Mr. Lachlan, Mr. Mackinnon, and others.
