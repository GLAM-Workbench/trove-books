INTRODUCTORY NOTICE.
The First Edition of the following Memoir was written for and published in
the ? Catalogue of the Natural and Industrial Products of New South Wales,"
and forwarded to the Paris Universal Exhibition of 1867 by the New South
Wales Exhibition Commissioners, at whose request it was undertaken.
It was re-printed at Melbourne in the ? Official Record of the Intercolonial
Exhibition of Australasia? in the same year, and was subsequently honored
by being transferred to the pages of the ? American Journal of Science and
Art."
The Second Edition was prepared for the ? Report of the Intercolonial
Exhibition of 1870, at Sydney,? and was included with an Essay ? On the
Progress of Gold Discovery in Australasia from 1860 to 1871 ? (by the same
author) in the work entitled, ? The Industrial Progress of New South
Wales.?
The Third Edition carried on the mention of Geological experiences as to the
Sedimentary Formations of Australasia to the year 1875, and had reference
to the Philadelphia International Exhibition of 1876 ?of the New South
Wales Commission for which, and of those of the years abovenamed, the
author had the honor of being a Member.
The present (or Fourth) Edition continues the Progress of Geological
investigation up to date, and contains much fresh information. It is dedicated

REMARKS ON THE SEDIMENTARY FORMATIONS OF NEW
SOUTH WALES.
If we inspect the map of Australia we observe that the coasts of
Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland follow the general
directions (with some irregularity) of the Cordillera, or elevated
land separating the waters flowing directly to the coast from those
which, draining the interior, disembogue to the south-west.
The Murray River receives some parts of its tributaries from
the high lauds of Victoria, and others from New South AVales ;
whilst the Darling and its tributaries collect the remainder of
the supply from as far north as 25� s.
The Cordillera thus sweeps round in an irregular curve from
w. to E. to the head of the Murray ?and thence, northerly and
north-easterly, to the head of the Condamine; trending north-
westerly from that point to 21� s., whence it strikes to the north,
terminating its course at Cape Melville, in 14� s., about the
meridian of 144� 30' E., which is that of Mount Alexander in
Victoria.
The more westerly and southerly trend of drainage is repre-
sented by the Thomson and Barcoo Rivers, which carry off the
waters of the Cordillera at the back of the Barrier Ranges to
Spencer?s Gulf. The meridian of the head of that Gulf is there-
fore the western limit of East Australia.
The Cordillera itself, described in part by Strzelecki in 1845,
was traced by him through a considerable part of its diversified
course (as understood by him), from the southern point of Tas-
mania to the parallel of 28�, in longitude 152�, but not further
westward than 146�, on the parallel of Mount Alexander. It is,
however, doubtful whether the range between this furthest
western point and Wilson?s Promontory, where he considers the
chain to be cut off by the sea, forms anything more than a spur in
that direction, though passing through Bass?s Strait onto Tasmania.
But the extent of the Cordillera westerly, to its termination
on the border of South Australia, is so well defined that there
can be no question that the s.w. and w. extension has as true a
character as any part of the northern prolongation. This may be
geologically deduced from researches of the Geological Survey of
Victoria. That province is limited, at its eastern corner, by a line
joining Cape Howe and the head of the Murray, so that the
boundary crosses very near the highest point of all Australia,
which Strzelecki made 6,500 feet above the sea, but which
subsequent observations have shown to be 7,175 feet. This
correction rests on observations made by myself in 1852, and on
a re-discussion of them in comparison with results obtained by


Professor Neumayer in 1862. On Bth May, 1852, I made the
highest point of Kosciusco 4,077 feet above my then base, at
6,098 feet above the which therefore came out 7,175 feet;
and in February, 1863, Professor Neumayer wrote me word that
lie made the highest peak, in November, 1862, 7,176 feet. This
makes Kosciusco?s summit, above the crossing place of the Indi
or Hume River, at Groggan?s, 5,425 feet.
To the northwards, the 144 th meridian limits very nearly all
the high land of the East Coast to Cape Melville, whilst the
142 nd meridian limits to the westward the basin of the Darling,
including part of the drainage along the Thomson and Barcoo,
from the head of the Flinders to where it passes into South
Australia on the 141 st meridian.
Thus, all this enormous drainage of western New South "Wales
and south-western Queensland is, as it wore, bounded by ranges
of high geological antiquity, the Grey and Barrier groups being
of undoubted similar age to the mass of the eastern Cordillera.
It has long been known that the strike of the oldest Sedimen-
tary rocks through the Cordillera, in Victoria, as well as in New
South Wales, is generally meridional; so that in the former
province the beds strike across the Cordillera, whilst in the latter
they form various angles from parallelism with it to a tranverse
direction, as the chain doubles and winds irregularly in its course.
This is the experience of the Victorian Survey, and my own
traverses across various points of the Corddlera in New South
Wales and Victoria establish the fact of a normal meridional
strike of the oldest strata. So distinct, indeed, is this charac-
teristic, that the settlers in various parts of this Colony have
been accustomed to trace the direction of north and south by the
strike of the slates, and are often guided by it.
It sometimes happens that, owing to the high angle of dip, and
the effect of denudation on the overlying formations, the Cor-
dillera itself becomes in places almost knife-edged, so that in
New South Wales it presents occasionally a watershed not
more than nine paces in width ; whilst in Maneero to the south,
and in New England to the north, it spreads out in a plateau,
on which eastern and western waters rise close together and
sometimes overlap. These different features have a variable
geological value as well as aspect; for, owing to the strike of the
older rocks, the breadth of the Silurian formations, which, as in
other countries, are repeated by recurring folds, may be more
exposed in Victoria than it is in New South Wales ; and owing
to the curve of the Cordillera probably the same.beds are traceable
to the north which occur in the south ; as, for example, the
auriferous rocks of Omeo and Peak Downs, which are on the same
meridian; and thus the meridional strike is exhibited along
the north-east coast, where there are alternations of old rocks


forming precipitous cliffs with low valleys and beaches separating
those alternations.
Independently of this arrangement, the whole of the central
area inside the eastern Cordillera has a trend to the south and
west, so that the waters collected between 22� and 37� 5.,-on the
east of South Australia, find their way to the sea at the eastern
corner of that province.
We might naturally assume that one order of deposits is to bo
expected throughout the Cordillera; but there is a singular
exception. Whilst Marine deposits of Tertiary age are found
along the west coast of Australia, and along the southern coast
from Cape Leeuwin to Cape Howe, there are no known Marine
Tertiaries in any part of the Coast of New South Wales and
Queensland tip to the Cape York Peninsula; and the reason of
this may be, that, as indicated by phenomena before pointed out
by me, but which on this occasion cannot be further dwelt upon,
the eastern extension of Australia has been probably cut off by
a general sinking, in accordance with the Barrier Eeef theory of
Mr. Darwin. This has some support from the fact that there is
a repetition of Australian formations in the Louisiade Archipelago,
New Caledonia, and New Zealand?in the latter of which occur
abundant Tertiary deposits. The intervening ocean may there-
fore be supposed to cover either a great synclinal depression or
a denuded series of folds ; but, as shown in 1874 by the soundings
from H.M.S. ?Challenger,? this depression is of enormous depth,
in one sounding 2,625 fathoms having been reached.
[Relatively speaking then, the Cordillera of the eastern coast
has not been subject to the changes which introduced the relics
of a Tertiary ocean, or they have been removed by subsequent
sinking and denudation. At any rate, no evidence is known to
me of Marine Tertiaries on the lands north of Cape Howe.
Another fact worthy of notice, as showing the probable ancient
geological vicissitudes of Australia, is, that the great
series which is so prominent in New South Wales and in parts of
Queensland, but which is less distributed in V ictoria, and there
only partially and irregularly as to the portions still remaining,
has been broken up and carried away, so as to have left the
various members dislocated, ruined, and separated in such a way
as to allow no clear view to be taken of the whole till all the
various portions have been separately examined ; and to the
want of this personal examination on the part of certain Paleon-
tologists and others who have never yet studied the Carboniferous
formation of New South Wales, is to be attributed the per-
tinacity with which they have so long disputed facts attested by
geologists in New South Whies who are familiar with that
Colony and with Victoria also, but who are ignored by the closet-
geologists of the latter.


In consequence of the absence of Marine Tertiary deposits in
New South Wales, and the occurrence of a more complete series
of the strata in the sections of the Carboniferous formation, there
has arisen a difficulty in collating the gold-deposits with those of
Victoria; and, in this respect, at present the Upper deposits in
the former province have not been assigned with much precision
to the epochs adapted by Mr. Selwyn for the latter. And it also
follows that his view of the distinct ages of Pliocene auriferous
and Miocene non-auriferous gravels cannot be tested in New
South Wales, if indeed it has not already been tested by the
actual discovery of gold in the so-called Miocene deposits them-
selves, as they occur in Victoria.
So far as is at present known, gold in Victoria is derived
chiefly from the Lower Silurian formation; but researches con-
ducted for me at H.M. Mint in Sydney prove that it exists in
almost every distinctive rock of New South Wales. In this pro-
vince the alluvial deposits are not so extensive as in Victoria;
but this probably arises from the fact previously mentioned, of the
strike being in Victoria transverse to the direction of the Cor-
dillera, by which means the currents which distributed the
drift had a wider area of gold-bearing materials to denude than
in New South AVales, where, I conclude from numerous examples,
the principal currents were to northward, so that in that province
they would coincide with the direction of the Cordillera, and not
accumulate the deposits in such low-lying extensive regions as
those of the Murray Districts. The same objection would obtain
on the supposition of gradual waste and accumulation from less
powerful agency than that of a general rush of water. It is not
however to be doubted, that there is an enormous amount of gold
yet untouched in numerous places in New South AVales, not only
in the quartz lodes (or reefs) but in gullies and plains where
alluvial gold diggings will yet be discovered.
Dr. Duncan, in an elaborate paper on some of the Fossil Tertiary
Corals of Australia (?Proceedings of the Geological Society,? August,
1870), suggests the propriety of discarding the divisions into
Pliocene, Miocene, and Eocene of the Australian Tertiaries, and
of substituting the general term 1 Kainozoic, since he considers
them merely as successive deposits of one continuous epoch. But
as proved by my own researches more than twenty years ago,
much of the gold in New South Wales is derived from iron pyrites,
in granite and in beds of Sedimentary origin consisting of
siliceous matter cemented by iron derived from decomposed
pyrites; whilst it has been shown by Aplin, Daintree, Hacket,
Wilkinson, and others, that much gold in Victoria and Queens-
land is due to the intrusive agency of felstones, elvanites, and
diorite. The dykes or reefs of quartz in the Silurians are there-
fore not, as once supposed, the exclusive sources of Australian


gold. Nay, there is good reason to believe that the Carboniferous
rocks are themselves impregnated, as in one remarkable instance
on Peak Downs.*
In New Zealand gold sometimes occurs so mixed with siliceous
particles as to constitute with them a golden sandstone.
The distinctive differences in material mineral wealth between
Victoria and New South Wales are not altogether confined to
gold or tin, which latter metal is well represented in New South
Wales and Queensland ; but coal, iron, and copper, and perhaps
lead, prove together more than an equivalent of the great amount
of gold in Victoria.
At the Universal Exhibition of Paris in 1855, the present
writer exhibited a collection of rocks and fossils, illustrating the
* This example is thus referred to in a communication to me from Mr.
Daintree, F.G.S., in a letter dated ?Maryvale, North Kennedy, Jany. 22nd,
1870:?
? I believe if the Peak Downs District were carefully mapped, it would be
incontestably proved that payable drift gold is there found in the Carboniferous
con glomerates. ? ?
He then gives a section of the shaft and drive then being worked at the
Springs, about 12 miles from Clermont, and adds : ?? The miners use the Car-
boniferous sandstone, the Glossopteris bed at bottom, and take the cement
several inches from its junction with the Glossopteris bed for their wash-
dirt. The surface of the Glossopteris bed is unbroken, dips southerly at
an angle of about s�, and the cement lies conformably on it, and little
patches of mud deposit in the cement, similar in appearance to the Glossopteris
sediment, lie in the same plane as that bed, and I have no doubt the cement
is conformable to the Glossopteris bed of the same period of deposit. Small
fragments of Coal were taken from the adjoining shaft, and I have no doubt,
with the necessary time given to the work, Carboniferous fossils may ultimately
be found in the conglomerates themselves ?so putting the matter beyond
reach of dispute.?
A similar instance of such an occurrence was examined by myself in the
Coal Measure drift of Tallawang, in the county of Phillip, in the year 1875,
and recognized as payable by C. S. Wilkinson, Esq., F.G.S., the present
Geological Surveyor, in his report to the Minister of Mines, Dec., 1876, in
which place there is mention of other notices by myself of like association.
The localities are similar in geological structure ; for almost in the words of
Mr. Daintree, which Mr. Wilkinson never read, the latter says, ? These con-
glomerates are associated with beds of sandstone and shale, containing Olos-
.sop ter is, the fossil plant characteristic ?of our Coal Measures.? [? Annual
Report for year 1876,? p. 173.]
I made a section of the deposits which I found resting on hard shales
(probably Devonian) in which numerous shallow shafts have produced
alluvial gold. The bottom of the beds above the base exhibited a brecciated
fragmentary deposit, well seen a mile or two away, on the road to Cobbora ?
above which sandstones, flinty shale, coarse grits, the red shales of Mount
Victoria and Blackheath occur; and, nearer the top, Yertebraria and
Glossopteris and Charcoal are met with. One of the beds was of quartz-
pebbles, cemented by ferruginous matter, precisely like many detrital frag-
ments in other gold-fields, and specially resembling that above Govctt?s Leap,
in which I obtained gold in 1863.


whole of the geological formations of Australia as then known,
aiul these were enumerated in their strati graphical order in the
published catalogue. A few remarks on the various geological
epochs, as they now represent themselves in New South Wales,
with brief statements as to their connection with other portions
�f Australasia, may be all that is necessary on the present
occasion, in addition to a comparison of the catalogue above
referred to with the collection exhibited in Paris in 1878 by the
Department of Mines, Sydney, and others, to show the progress
of geological development in New South Wales during the last
twenty-three years.
� 1. So-called ?Azoic? or ? Metaaiorphic ? Hocks.
There has not been sufficient evidence yet collected to show
that these rocks extensively exist in Eastern Australia, although
in Tasmania rocks ot a doubtful class (and which may perhaps
be only highly altered Lower Silurian) have been referred to them
by Mr. Gould. The existence of gueissoid strata, and of schists
of very ancient aspect, with occasional unfossiliferous limestones,
are also well known in New South Wales, as at Cow Flat, near
Bathurst; Cooma Hill, Maneero ; Wagga Wagga; flanks of
Mount Kosciusko, &c. ; but it would be premature to place them,
without doubt, under the present head. Mr. Daintree, however,
describes them as the source of some gold in the Cape Eiver and
Gilbert Districts, to the North. Some of those mentioned under
the ?hirst Epoch? of Strzelecki, have, on close inspection,
appeared to me to be merely the products of transmutation;
nor is such an improbable result, seeing that in Australia some
slates have been changed into granitic rocks. It is at least
certain that such rocks generally occur in the immediate vicinity
of granites, which latter frequently occupy large areas both in
Maneero and in New England, as well as along the Cordillera, and
in independent masses along the coast. In Western Australia,
where an enormous region is occupied by granites, and the older
formations are represented only by small patches of slates, whilst
the granites themselves remain bare, these patches are found on
the flanks of the granitic bosses and at extremely wide intervals ;
nor have I been able to detect among the numerous collections
which have passed through my hands, any distinct evidence of
any but doubtful examples of those foliated rocks which belong
to the so-called Primary epoch. In Southern Australia, also,
there does not appear to be any considerable amount of strata
which could be referred to this epoch. Transmutation has, how-
ever, acted vigorously in New South Wales in all the older
formations.


� 2. Lower Paleozoic Eocks. ?Lower axd Upper Silurian.
Of these there are undoubted evidences in some limited dis-
tricts of Tasmania and Queensland, whilst in Victoria and New
South Wales considerable areas are occupied by them.
Western Australia has as yet not furnished any fossils of
Silurian age; but, according to Mr. Y. L. Brown, Government
Geologist, there are clay slates, schists, and other rocks which
may be Silurian much transmuted, judging from their position
and composition.
North Australia is in much the same condition, where no
reliable geological surveys have been yet made.
Much valuable information was in 1861 collected by the Eev.
Julian E. Tenison-Woods, and published at Adelaide, in
which gold-bearing rocks were but slightly anticipated. Since
then, the Northern Territory (assigned to South Australia) has
exhibited gold-reefs in probably Silurian strata ; and very recently
a tract of several thousand square miles in extent, between the
Victoria Eiver and the Gulf of Carpentaria, along the Daly
Eiver and the central lines of communication by telegraph, has
been reported as auriferous, and, I anticipate, will be found rich.
South Australia proper, according to Mr. Woods (? Geology ,?
pp. 20, 21) has produced two Silurian fossils, Cruziana cucurhita
and Pentamerus oblongus. The former occurs in Bolivia, and the
latter in New South Wales.
Nothing lower than Siluro-Devonian, according to Mr.
Etheridge (in ? Review of Mr. Daintree s Fossils ,? Q.J.G.S., August,
1872), had up to that time been found in Queensland. But as
elsewhere mentioned, I considered the Brisbane slates to be
analogous with those of the Anderson Creek Gold-field in
Victoria, both of which groups I examined personally in situ.
The latter are held to be Upper Silurian.
In Tasmania, along the Gordon and Eranklin Eivers, occur
various Silurian fossils, some among which identical with those
of New South Wales were noticed by me ; but Mr. Gould con-
siders others to be Lower Silurian. This formation evidently
exists in that Colony, for in 1873 I received from Mr. T. Stevens,
E.G.S., some Trilobite-sandstone from the western part of the
Island, which Mr. Etheridge determined for me to contain
Phacops, Ogygia , and Calymene; and to these Professor Bradley, of
the U.S., to whom was forwarded for me by Professor J. D. Dana
some of the rock, added Conoceplialites, a true Lower Silurian
fossil in America, Sweden, Bohemia, and Spain, a curious position
for which in the last-named country is assigned in an interesting
paper by Seiior Casiano de Prado (?Bull. Soc. Geol. de France
2 de S./xvii, 516.)


Mr. Grould mentioned, in June, 18G0, a Calymene at the base
o� the Eldon Range. I found that genus also in New South
AVales in 1852. In Victoria Professor M?Coy has made a list of
twenty-five Power and fifty-three Upper Silurian fossils, inclu-
ding in the former twenty-three Hydroid Zoophytes, and another
species belonging to the Upper formation. Of the Graptolitidse
only one is said to have been found in this Colony, and I presume
that it is more likely to belong to the Upper Silurian than to the
Lower, though towards the Victorian boundary, along the Deleget
River, Lower Silurian rocks, according to some, are supposed to
make their appearance.
New South Wales offers a more determined evidence of the
existence of certain Silurian deposits, but singularly enough
nothing has been positively shown of the existence of any fossils
below the base of the Llandovery or the Middle Silurian, except
in the case just mentioned.
To this epoch I referred fossils found by me in Maneero, in my
Report of November, 1851, which was re-published in 1860 ; and
it is satisfactory to find that the examination of a considerable
amount of specimens by Prof, de Koninck of Liege, who kindly
undertook the task of describing them, has resulted in a confir-
mation of my opinion. (See Appendix XIV.)
Summing up his review of sixty of these, he says?that they are
in nearly equal divisions of the upper and lower beds of the
Upper Silurian formation, and that they closely agree with the
fossils of Europe and America; that the major portion of the
former belongs to the Actinozarians and Crustaceans, and that
the latter are nearly all Mollusca; and that none of the Grap-
tolites noticed by Prof. M?Coy in 1861, and more recently by
Mr. R. Etheridge, junr., from the Victorian strata, occur in the
collection sent by me. And he concludes, as I have done, that
at present the existence of fossil beds below the Middle Silurian
has not yet been determined in New South Wales.
It is otherwise in Victoria, but it may be that some of the
highly transmuted rocks of the south-west portion of New South
Wales may yet furnish traces of greater antiquity when
thoroughly examined. In the last Edition of this memoir, pub-
lished in 1870, I mentioned the existence of certain Corals, Trilo-
bites, &c., as determined forme in 1858 by the late Messrs. Salter
and Lonsdale. (JSee Appendix XVII.)
The Mudstones of AArralumla, with Encrinurus and Calymene;
the Coralline and Pentamerus beds of Deleget and Colalamine ;
the Tentaculite and Halysites beds of Wellington and Cavan ;
and the Silverdale and Downing beds with Calymene, Encrinurus,
Beyrichia; and others with Llamas, Harpes, Bronteus ; Brachio-
poda,including Strophodonta; and Radiata, embracing Star-fishes?
point to the existence of at least the Upper Silurian formation on


both flanks of the southern part of the Cordillera. There are
also numerous corals, included in the list given by me in the
? Southern OoU Fields ? (p. 285), which also confirm the same
determination ; and it may be added that the above, and othei
fossils of this age mentioned by me elsewhere, have been
examined by Palaeontologists of eminence in Europe. Buch are
the genera Eavosites, Coenites, Ptychophyllum, Calamopoia, Syrin-
gopora, Emmonsia, Alveolites, Cystophyllum, &c. These, per-
haps, might not alone satisfy a doubt, but with them occurs
Eeceptaculites ; since 1858, when these were determined, I have
detected Halysites, which may settle'the question as to Upper
Silurian. Wenlock beds seem to be well developed on the
Deleget Eiver.
Professor De Koninck is not in antagonism with these geolo-
gists, but in the fresh series of my fossils he found among the
trilobites Staurocephalus, Cromus, Proetus, and Lichas, in addi-
tion to Calymene, Encrinurus, Illsenus, Harpes, and Bronteus
before announced by myself. (See Edition in 18/0, p. G; and
? Southern Gold Fields , 1860,? p. 28G.)
In a paper published by the learned Professor, in the
? Memoires de lei Societe Foyale de Liege, 2 de Serie, t. vi., 1876,
dedicated to the Silurian and Devonian species of N.S.W., for-
warded to him for his examination and description by myself, he
gives those, as detailed in Appendices -Z7F and XV, which I have
thus above epitomized. The description is given in a separate
form, with carefully executed figures, under the heading of
? Fecherches sur les Fossiles Paleozoiques de la Nouvelle- Galles du
Sud ,? in which, as will be noticed under the next section, are
included the Devonian fossils.
� 3. Middle Palaeozoic Eocks.
The late Mr. Jukes desired the term Devonian to be eliminated,
referring the so-called beds to the bottom of the Carboniferous
formation; but geologists have not generally accepted that
proposal. The series of shells, corals, &c., from the Murrum-
bidgee, which I submitted in 1858 to Messrs. Salter and Lons-
dale, through Sir E. I. Murchison, Bart.,* excited doubts as to
their belonging to any but Silurian and Carboniferous deposits.
Among these were Phanerotinus, Loxonema, Atrypa reticularis ,
Orthis resupiuata, Murchisonia, Strophomena, and Spirifera of
various species.
Mr. Salter?s Eeport to me was as follows: ??These fossils are
of a mixed character, many being of unquestionable Silurian age,
and others having all the aspect of Carboniferous and Devonian
* See Murchison?s ? Siluria ,? 3d ed., p. 226, and 4th ed., p. 276 and p. 462.


fossils. It will not be so easy to predicate those of Devonian
type, as there is much similarity between fossils of that age and
those ot either of the other systems, the Lower Devonian species
being very like Silurian, and the Upper Carboniferous ones,
iiut it none of the fossils came from Carboniferous beds, then
there must certainly be Devonian forms mixed with Upper
Mr. Morris contributed, in 1845, a paper to Strzelecki?s work
ot that year in which he says: ?The Paleozoic series of
Australia and Tasmania may be regarded as partly the equiva-
lent of the Devonian and Carboniferous systems of other
countries. (See Appendix VII)
In September, 1859, I addressed a letter to Mons. Delesse
which he communicated to the Geological Society of France, in
November, and in the report of the meeting (Bull xvii n 17) I
find ! expressed myself cautiously as follows :-?Le devonien

In 1861 (Cat. net. Bxh.) Professor MUoy stated that ?there
had as yet been no exact identifications to prove the existence
in Australia of the Intermediate Middle Paleozoic or Devonian
formation. And as recently as 1866, YicOmte d?Archiac
( Geologic et Paleontologie, ? p. 468), writes thus : ?Le dcveloppe-

by Professor M Coy, which, under the head of Devonian, includes
the following : Favositcs (two species), Spirifera Icevicostata, Gram-
mysia (n. sp.), Orthonoia (n. s.), Asferolepis (plates allied to). In
184/ the same skilful Palaeontologist noticed some striking
resemblances to Devonian fossils in a few of the large collection
I sent m to the Woodwardian Museum at Cambridge; and
also in 1847 (? Becherches sur Animaux
PossileS' ) records Sp. Murchisonianus , a Devonian fossil from
lasmama.


In order to test the existence of a wide-spread Devonian
series in New South Wales, I requested (as stated elsewhere)
my friend Professor De Koninck to undertake the examination
of a collection of 1,000 Palaeozoic fossils, comprising the Upper,
Middle, and Lower Paheozic formations as they exist here, and
in his account of the Devonian, received since the last edition of
this memoir, he remarks in his ?j �esume Geologique ? (op. cit.
p. 133), after giving the fullest assurance of all possible accuracy:
? Des quatrevingt-une especes observees en y comprenant

The-author goes on to say, that the first of this group of four
appears in Australia to occupy the place which in certain beds
in Europe, and very particularly in Belgium, is held by Becep-
tnculites Neptuni, Defrance, which as the other belongs to the
order of sponges.
As the collections under review were made in part before
1850, having been packed some years before they were sent for
examination to my highly honored friend, much correspondence
has taken place between us and as I have, since the specimens were
received by him, made numerous explorations, and during these


have very extensively collected from the region along the Yass
and Murrumhidgee Elvers (in continuation of my earlier re-
searches), and have had the opportunity of being accompanied
in 187G by Mr. Jenkins, of Yass, whose acquaintance with the
palaeontological treasures of that neighbourhood is verv great, ?
it has been my good fortune to hud the missing Calceola and
numerous Trilohites alluded to in the preceding extracts from
DeKoninck?s admirable ? Recherches At present I am unable
to submit these Yass fossils for description.
In addition to Calceola (which occurs also at Mount Frome,
County Phillip) I have been also able to satisfy my friend that
Recept acuities Neptuni also exists in New South Wales, as well
as R. Australis, which was sent by me to the late Mr. Salter and
figured by him in the ? Decades of Organic Remains of the
Geological Survey of Canada ,? in comparison with R. Occi-
dentalis syn. of R. Neptuni (See Decade I, pp. 45-47, pi. x, figs.
1-10). (See Appendix XVII before cited.')
It is true that Mr. Salter regards the R. Australis as Upper
Silurian, and rightly associates it with Tentaculites, Favosites,
Pentamerus, Orthoceras, Trochonema, Ehynconella, &c., which I
discovered in the south-western district of Maneero in 1851-2,
and also that R. Neptuni came from between Wellington and
Molong ; and that the actual limits of the Upper Silurian and
Devonian formations have not yet been accurately defined. But
when we find such a genus as Niso represented in a Palaeozoic
formation, as is the case with the Devonian of New South Wales,
and notice how frequently of late palaeontologists have been
obliged to admit the occurrence of genera and sometimes of
species of acknowledged younger formations in those of more
ancient date ?as anticipatory of future existences?it may be well
believed that Receptaculites may be generically known to such
double relations as the Silurian and Devonian. (See infra, p. 97.)
? C?est pour la premiere fois,? says De Koninck,? que la pre-
sence du Niso est signalee dans les terrains Paleozoiques, et il
faut remonter jusqu ?au terrain Tertiaire pour en retrouver do
nouveau les traces; cependant mon savant et excellent ami M.
Nyst, sans contredit un des meilleurs conchyliologistes de
Pepoque, que j?ai consulte a cet egard, croitpouvoir declarer avec
moi, qu'il n'existe pas une difference snffisante entre les carac-
teres generaux de Vespice Devonienne et ceux de Vespece Tertiaire
pour ne pas considerer Vune et Vautre comme generiquement
identiques .?
I may add here, that some years since, I sent to 11. M. Jenkins,
Esq., F.Gr.S. (when Curator of the Geological Society), a
species which he considered to be a Lepralia, which was bedded
in the limestone of Cavan on the Murrumhidgee and in the same


geological district as that uow discussed. M. De Koninck also
notices, in addition to Niso , the occurrence of Mitchellia in the
midst of Marine shells, as another striking anomaly in the Devo-
nian fauna, compared with that of Europe, concluding in these
words, ?? Elle n?est certes pas suffisante pour empecher de con-
siderer Tune et I?autre comme contemporaines et produites dans
des circonstances sinon tout a fait identiques, au moins tres-
analogues.? (p. 185).
It will he seen on perusing the lists of Devonian fossils, that
De Koninck includes those I referred to in the second Edition
(1870) of this memoir, from Yass, Mount Lambic, and Moruya
River, and which are in part identical with the 'Mount \\ yatt
shells in Queensland.
These latter are mostly Brachiopods, and I have collected them
during my different journeys of several years from the western
boundary of the Carboniferous formation (underlying it in situ),
and occasionally from a scattered over-lying drift, ranging for
nearly 200 miles of direct distance (included between 30� south
on the Moruya, to nearly 32� south). The principal of these
particular Brachiopods are ? Rhynconella pleurodon, P. piu/nus,
Spirifer disjunct us, S. Tassensis, Or t hides, Productce, Sfc. They
occur in situ between the slaty rocks of Sofala and the overlying
Carboniferous beds on the Turon ; south of Moruya River ; near
Mullamuddy on the Cudgegong River; at Cudgegong Creek ; in
the deep defiles of the Upper Colo River; at Brucedale and
Bathurst; and in other places. Mr. C. S. Wilkinson, with
whom I visited the locality in 1875, found them under interesting
circumstances occurring in a great synclinal curve, from nearly
the summits of Mount Lambie and Mount Walker (with con-
siderable dips), and explaining the sources from which the loose
pebbles collected by me at Bowenfells some years since were
probably derived. From the occurrence of different fossils in
the pebbles, it is certain that many strata of the -Devonian for-
mation must have been broken up, and it seems that similar beds
have undergone the same process in other countries, for I well
remember picking up in 1829, in the ? Platz? of Coblentz, on
the Rhine, a similar drift pebble, of just such rock as that in
question, containing a Brachiopod of like age.
During some recent explorations in the north-west of this
Colony, I became satisfied as to the widely-spread extent of the
Devonian series, of which more evidence will be elicited here-
after, the data for which are already sufficient, but there is no
room to introduce them on this occasion.
I may however mention now, that amongst the specimens
collected by me in the neighbourhood of Yass in 1876,1 find a
portion of an Ichthyodorulite, which I believe to be Devonian,


and that in March, 1878, Mr. C. S. "Wilkinson sent me for com-
parison a specimen of fossiliferous limestone, which 1 find also
came from the Murrumbidgee not from Yass, and which contains
a plate of a Coccosteus, of a triangular shape, studded with
tubercules of the same form as those on a plate of M'Coy?s C.
trigonaspis, but somewhat different on the whole from his figure,
(See ? British Palaeozoic Fossils ,? PI. 2. C. Pig. G e.) It is
attached to a portion of bone, and is in good preservation and
in the midst of fragments of other fossils, the matrix being
apparently the same as the Yarradong or Cavan limestone. It
was found by Mr. Hume.
Tasmania has at present furnished no well-established proof of
the distinct existence of Devonian rocks. But it is a fair
inference, first suggested by the late Mr. Salter, that the broad-
winged Spirifers common there in the Paleozoic beds imply the
probable occurrence. Mr. Jukes and Mr. Gould both repeated
the inference. Mr. Darwin and Mr. Selwyn agree that some
of the Tasmanian fossils ? occur in the Silurian, Devonian, and
Carboniferous strata of Europe.? This is nearly all that is
known respecting their position.
Western Australia, according to Mr. Brown?s Report, adds
nothing to the history of the Middle Palaeozoics ; but Mr. H.
Gregory indicated on his map and in his report the existence of
Devonian rocks near York and in other parts of that Colony.
Having examined the rocks so indicated, I can only state my
belief that they have no pretension to any such antiquity, and
are probably mere collections of loose granitic matter and other
drift cemented by ferruginous paste, which has since become
transmuted into concretionary nodules and haematite. There are
also pebbles of trap, much decomposed, in the so-called Devonian.
They may perhaps be more properly considered as representing
the laterite of India.
Queensland, on the other hand, according to Daintree?s notes,
exhibits a stretch of Devonians extending through ten degrees of
latitude. Hot the least interesting facts are that the Tin Mines
of Queensland (as well as those of Hew South Wales) occur in
granites of Devonian age.
At Gympie, on the River Mary, rich gold-bearing quartz-reefs
occur in transmuted slates and other tilted beds, which are com-
posed of detrited dioritic matter and brecciated deposits in
which are abundance of fossils of doubtful aspect, and these I
before referred to some part of the Carboniferous formation. Mr.,
Etheridge considers and has described the fossils as Devonian.
They certainly have much in common with the Devonian beds
of Horth Germany and Belgium, described by Sedgwick and
Murchison, as I stated iu the Second Edition, p. 10. It is right.


however, to remark that Professor M?Coy does not adopt this
?determination, considering the rocks to be younger.*
Whatever be the age of the G-ympie beds, in rocks of apparently
the same age in Queensland there is a vast amount of mineral
# The following are the grounds upon which I ventured an opinion as to
their Carboniferous age in 1871 (? Progress of Gold Discovery from 1860
to 1871,? pp- 5-7 )
Notes on Mr. Hacket?s Collection of Rocks and Fossils from the Gym pie
Gold-field.
1. This collection comprises two series of rocks, the one Sedimentary, the
other intrusive.
2. The latter consists of varieties of the greenstone group of the Plutonic
formations.
3. The former embraces several kinds of rock. Among them are some so
completely free from transmutation as to exhibit the characters of ordinary
schist, sandstone, and breccia; others appear to have been derived from
volcanic asli of the dioritic type, and have been, since their deposit, altered
by intrusive agency so as to put on the resemblance of diorite or greenstone,
and as such they have by some been classified.
4. The presence of fossils serves, however, to illustrate their conditions as
ash-beds deposited in an ocean troubled by contemporaneous or subsequent
igneous action, which, after the consolidation (in part) of the strata containing
organic bodies, became changed by the new eruption. A considerable portion
of the Gympie Gold-field has thus become a metamorphic area.
5. Such phenomena are by no means rare in Australia. Bedded, as well as
intersecting, basalt occurs largely in the Illawarra Carboniferous district of
New South Wales, whilst, in the western border of that Colony (as about
Wellington) greenstone is exhibited in a similar connection with Upper
Silurian Strata. At Waimalee (Prospect Hill, near Parramatta) an old diorite,
precisely like that of Bople, to the eastward of the Mary River, has furnished
a matrix for the plant beds of the Wianamatta Rocks, the highest in the New
South Wales series of Sedimentary deposits ; and these have been subsequently
transmuted by younger igneous rocks that pierce and overflow them.
6. The whole of the Sedimentary deposits in Mr. Hacket?s collection betray
the effects of contemporaneous independent forces. The purple schistose rock
contains, besides an occasional fossil, fragments of igneous produ ts, and some
segregated quartz ; and the gray and greenish fine-grained stone, derived from
dioritic detritus, contains frequently much lime, many imperfect squeezed
fossils, with a portion of some drifted matter. Patches of the purple schist
occur in the green rock ; and in the brecciated beds composed of fragmentary
materials (the result of violence and subsequent consolidation in a state of
repose), chemical action has produced segregations of quartz which simulate true
quartz veins.
7. It is to be presumed that the fissures in the strata which are now filled
in with auriferous and cupriferous quartz were formed at a later period. A
considerable time must have elapsed, for many of the fossils are themselves
changed or partly obliterated, and are traceable only by the glistening cleavage
of calcareous sections.
8. Mr. Hacket has marked one variety of rock Sehalstein, and it certainly
agrees with the definition of that species, inasmuch as it is laminated with
thin partings or coatings of calc-spar. Now this is a very common occurrence
in parts of Germany where greenstone is also present, and where the age ot
the rocks is Devonian. Sehalstein is truly a derivative and not an inde-
pendent product, and therefore must be included with the other transmuted
deposits. This rock exhibits at Gympie an exact resemblance to its namesake


wealth besides gold, as ores of copper, iron, tin, lead, antimony,
mercury, &c. The work entitled ? Notes on the Geology of Queens-
land, with the Appendix of Animal Fossils : By R. Etheridge, Fsq.,
F.R.S., F.G.S., Palceontologist to the Geological Survey of Great
on the Lalm, in Germany, where also are traces of copper ores and jasperised
schists, as at Gympie. Mr. Ilackct?s excellent map of the Gympie Gold-
fields should be studied in connection with the valuable memoirs of Sedgwick
and Murchison, in the ? Transactions of the Geological Society of London ,?
2nd series, vol. 6 : ?? On the Older Deposits of North Germany and Belgium
9. There is another probable connection between these Gympie beds and
those just referred to. At any rate, so far as the fossils go, they lead to the
conclusion that they are not older than Devonian, and may be Upper
Palaeozoic. The principal fossils capable of indication are Nucula, Fenestella,
Solarium, Spirifera, Orthonota, Edmondia, Stenopora, and Producta, which
last alone proves some of the beds to bo not above the Upper and not below
the Middle Palaeozoic periods.
10. If this view is maintained, then we have evidence at Gympie, which is
well supported elsewhere in Queensland and in parts of New South Wales,
that auriferous quartz-reefs occur in rocks younger than Silurian ; and we
have there also an additional proof of the influence of greenstone in the
production of gold deposits. The fact was many years ago pointed out by
myself and by Mr. Odernheimer in relation to the Peel River Gold-field, and
it has since then been extensively confirmed in the Thames River Gold-field in
New Zealand.
11. In Mr. Aplin?s report of July 21, 1869, mention is made of the resem-
blance of fossils in calcareous grits at Canal Creek to those in the ? dioritc
slates? at Gympie. The beds there are said to form ? a narrow land between
the greenstone area and the river.? In these strata, though placed under the
head of ? Silurian beds,? the principal fossils are Spirifera and Producta. It
is more than doubtful whether Producta has ever been found in the Silurian
formations, and it is held to be the most distinct of all fossiliferous tests of the
epoch to which it is confined. So far as is known, it belongs to the Upper and
Middle Palaeozoic, and ranges only from Permian to Devonian formations.
Assuming this limit for Canal Creek and Gympie, it becomes certain that beds
of the age to which the fossils belong have a wide range in Southern Queens-
land, and this is the case in Northern Queensland also. Evidence will one
day be produced to prove the occurrence of gold in the Upper Pala>ozoic
formations in other localities. Nay, Mr. Daintree has given me his reasons
for believing that it so occurs on Peak Downs. (See quotation in note
at p. 9.)
The association of greenstone rocks with beds containing the fossils indicated,
will form a guide for prospectors in fresh districts of the Colony.
Too much importance cannot therefore be given to the establishment of
the fact to which the researches of Messrs. Hacket, Daintree, Aplin, and
Ulrich have contributed, that igneous rocks of a certain class are the surest
indications of gold in Queensland.
Mr Etheridge figures the following species as Devonian from Gympie :
? Aviculopecten limaformis; ?A. imlricatus; A. mulliradiatus; Spirifera
dnbia; S. undifera; Strophomena rhomloidalis, var. analog a ; Pleurotomaria
carinata; Eiiomphalus ; Fenestella fossula ; Ceriopora ? laxa {Daintree's
? Notes on the Geology of Queensland,? Q. J.G.S., Augt:, 1872, pp. 326, 333) ;
others are mentioned as Edmondia concentrica; Productus cora; Spirifera
bisulcata ; S. undulata, &c.
De Koninck, 1877, considers the series to he Carboniferous, naming some of
those given above as younger than Devonian. {See Appendix XVI. ? C.?)


Britain, and W. Carruthcrs, Esq., F. 8.5., F.G.S., Keeper of the
Botanical Department of the British Museum," is an invaluable
document, and deserves consultation (Q. J. G. S., vol. xxyiii,
pp. 271, 360.) The map, especially the large independent edition,
and the plates and other illustrations, arc highly useful.
It is interesting to find Dr. Hector stating at the beginning of
1875 that 2,000 specimens of Lower Devonian or Upper Silurian
fossils have been obtained from the north-west district of the
South Island of New Zealand (? Ninth Annual Report of the
Colonial Museum, 1874.?) And equally interesting is it to know
that New Caledonia also holds out hope of contribution to the
Middle and Lower Palaeozoic faunas, as in the Isle Ducos,
Leptsena, Spirifera, Orthis, &c., occur with rolled Brachiopods of
the same character as those of the ? Gulf? on the Turon River
of this Colony. (? Annales des Mines,? tome xii, p. 54, 1867.)
Monsieur M. P. Pischer is disposed to assign them to the Devonian
period (? Bulletin de la Soc. Geol. de France," 18 Mar., 1867).!
In further reference as to New South Wales, it may be well to
mention that there seems to be in parts of the Western Districts
an exhibition of rocks which resemble in various ways the con-
glomerates of the ? Old Red Sandstone? of Europe ; such overlie
the Marine Upper Silurian beds in the neighbourhood ot Wel-
lington and elsewhere, and are known to contain Lepidodendra.
These may be well studied in the ravine of Curragh Creek, where
they overlie the Eavosites beds of Jew?s Creek, &c. They form
ranges of considerable extent and of prominent features, and
stretch, according to my observations, to the Coutombals and in
patches as far as the Lachlan. The occurrence of a peculiar
species of Lepidodendron in three of the Colonies, New South
Wales, Queensland, and Victoria, has given rise to much con-
troversv as to the age of the rocks in which it occurs. It has
been long known to me, but it is only recently that it has been
found by me in widely distant localities, sometimes solitary, at
others in beds in which other plants of similar age occur.
It seems indeed as if every individual discovery in the Geology
of this Colony had a history or literature of its own.
In June, 1851, Professor M?Coy wrote to me from Cambridge
respecting the first Lepidodendron he had seen from Australia,
and which I had forwarded by the late Rear-Admiral King to
Professor Sedgwick, and stated it to be L. tetragonum of the
English Coal-fields.
The late Mr. Salter, in his letter to me of May 9, 1859, said,
however, that the genus was not Lepidodendron.
In November, 1863, Sir C. Bunbury wrote to Professor R.
Jones respecting a collection of Australian fossil plants, including
the above species, sent home by me and now in the Museum ot


the Geological Society, where they were inspected by him at my
request, and noticed one (the one) which he considered to be very
like X. tetragonum.
During the last few years I have collected or received this
plant from a variety of localities in New South Wales and
Queensland, and from the latter Colony it was also brought in
abundance by Mr. Daintree. Mr. Carruthsrs, who has given its
description fully in the paper before alluded to (Q. J.G.S., Aug.,
1872), has assigned to it the name of a species described by
Unger, viz., Lepidodendron nothum.
The extent of territory from which my specimens have been
collected embraces a direct distance of more than 1,100 miles
(English) between 19� s. and 35� s. (of course at intervals only),
from which we may infer the importance of its discovery in any
new locality, as establishing the existence of a portion of the
Devonian series to which it has been finally assigned.
It was satisfactory to be able to recognize this plant in January,
1875, in a creek near Eydal, on a spur of the Mount Lambic
Eange, where the Devonian Brachiopoda occur, and to be able to
direct Mr. Wilkinson to the locality where he found his five
additional specimens, which certainly established the position in
situ of the species near that locality.
But it was not until subsequent visits in 1876 and 1877 that I
was enabled to detect the plant actually in situ, and which
enabled me to ascertain the proper position of its habitat, which
is considerably below the level of the Brachiopod sandstone
of Mount Lambie, and on a spur of that range overlooking
Solitary Creek. As a guide to future explorers, I left a ? broad
arrow? mark on the fence nearest the spot.
Professor M?Coy adheres to his first opinion that the plant is
not X. nothum (See ? Coal Report ,? and JDecade I, ? JProdomus of
the Geology of Victoria ,? ?pi. ix), and calls it X. Australe.
Writing in 1861, the learned Professor proves that there is no
mistake about the identity of the plant in question ; for he says,
a specimen of it, still I believe in the Melbourne Museum, is of
the same species as the only Palceozoic Coal-plant ever collected
in New South Wales, and which was sent to him about twelve
years ago for ?determination during the controversy as to the age
of the plant-beds of the Newcastle N.S.W. beds.? This mistake
as to date is of no importance, as it is rectified by my previous
quotation from Mr. M?Coy?s letter, and I only refer to it to
show, which is due to himself, that we are treating of the same
plant.
But there may be found many, and there are already known in
New South AVhles several distinct species of Lepidodendron and
its allies, in the Lower Coal-beds along the Kama Basin and else-


where ; and although in the Upper seams they may not he known,
we have the testimony of Sir Thomas Mitchell, on the authority
of the late Mr. Lonsdale (? Parliamentary Papers, 14 January,
1852?), that a Lepidodendrou was found ? in sandstone? between
Windsor and Parramatta, that sandstone with impression of
Lepidodendrou was also found over granite near Cox?s River, ?
and I possess a cast of a Lepidodendrou (verified as such by
Mr. R. Etheridge, junr.) in sandstone also, from the hanks of
the Warragamha, between the junction of the Wollondilly with
Cox?s River and the junction of the Warragamha with the
being one in a Devonian area, and the others in the
Wianamatta Basin. And if it be argued that they all came from
one source, and were drift fragments (which may be or not be
the case) still, as we discover elsewhere in Australia that the
drift Lepidodendra are almost all found not far from the parent
beds, the inference would naturally be that these had not drifted
far to the localities now pointed out.
Mr. M?Millan himself told me in Melbourne in 1860 that the
Lepidodendrou found by him, and which was I presume the one
I saw in the Museum, and which is figured by Professor M?Coy,
was picked up from the surface and first used to keep a door
open or shut in a store at Melbourne. But if it was not taken
from its bed it is of no more value than any of those scattered
about the surface of Australia elsewhere. But the inferential
value is the same in all the cases.
The subject, however, with which we arc now concerned need
not depend on stick data.
Professor M?Coy states that ? the sandstone containing the
present species in Victoria has been found by Air. Howitt over a
large extent of Gippsland to lie always unconformably on the
upturned edges of the true Devonian rocks ; * and Air. Selwyn
mentions other specimens of Lepidodendrou from the Avon.
These admissions are worth very much to any controversy 1
may have had with the able and skilled Paleontologist of Victoria,
whose judgment as to genus or species I have no pretensions to
* I now recollect that Professor M?Coy has admitted this fact, ?as to the
specimen he alludes to in the Melbourne Museum, the Government Geologist
can testify that on first seeing it some years ago in a store at Melbourne ,
I at once characterised it to him as the most important palaeontological
specimen ever found in the Colonv,? &c. [? Commentary ? read before the
Hoy. Sac., Melbourne, 25th June, 1860.] But in 1861 the Professor had not
apparently realised the value of the find, for he says in the ? Catalogue of the
Victorian Exhibition, 1861,? p. 164 : ? Having as yet seen no distinct identifi-
cations to prove the existence in Australia of the intermediate Middle Paleo-
zoic or Devonian formations ; ? hut in 1857 he speculated on the occurrence of
the Carboniferous formation all the way from the Avon into N. S. Wales.

Coal Fields see infra.']


dispute, but who, like all the world, must necessarily be amenable
to facts and logic ; I therefore forego all comments on L. nofhum
and L. Australe , and leave the decision where it should rest?in
the hands of Palaeontologists.
Two points, however, remain for remark on the Devonian.
Gratified as I always am (when I consider that I have never
had an hour?s assistance in the field from any individual during
my thirty-nine years of geological labour to profit by the collected
intelligence and the host of well-skilled physicists that help to
make geology what it ought to be) to peruse the recitals of the
field-geologists of Victoria, I have had especial pleasure in
reading Mr. Hewitt?s description of the Devonian area in Gipps-
land, and of his researches on the Snowy River and other
localities in Victoria which I visited and examined in 1851.
In those days the Devonians were unknown to Australian
explorers, and even so late as 18G3 only a suspicion existed as to
the actual relation of the strata about Mount Tambo and other
places in Gippsland.
The limestones of Buchan and Bindi had not been as now cor-
related with Devonian, and the Director of the Geological Survey
of Victoria himself, in 186G, held the opinion that the arrange-
ment was such that the limestones were Upper Paheozoic. It is
not surprising therefore, that in the patch of fossiliferous rock
in a narrow gully at the very head of the Murray River which I
discovered in December, 1851, I should have considered it ? not
younger than the base of the Lower Carboniferous ? ?which
justifies the remark I made in the last Edition, that if Professor
M?Coy was ? right ? in determining the Devonian to be the epoch
of these Gippsland limestones, I could not be far wrong, espe-
cially considering that my discovery of fossiliferous rocks was
made in a great hurry for want of time to institute careful
search, during a journey in unpleasant weather, after lying all
night on the bare ground, on the upper slope of the Great
Dividing Range, at Kurnoolec (Native Dog Creek), on my way
from Moambah to Omeo. In 1870 the remark was made by me
that ? in 1851 ? I held Mr. Selwyn?s view, but I had no intention
of disputing subsequent results ; I do not think I was justly
dealt with when I was reproved for so doing, especially as in
1870 I had written in the following words to the Editor of the
? Sydney Herald ? (in reply to a statement in the ? Ovens and
Murray Advertiser ? respecting an alleged discovery of an Ichthy-
osaurus at the head of the Indi or Murray River) :??On l 6
December, 1851, I visited the locality and found Marine fossils
there of an age not younger than the Lowest Carboniferous
rocks of N. S. Wales. The Victorian geologists consider them
Devonian.?


Mr. Selwyn reported plants from Mount Tambo, but Mi.
Howitt f? On Devonian Hods of North Gipps Land. Progress
Report," No. 111, p. 28B] says that in 187G he could not hud
any. That locality is not very far from the one visited by me
I certainly saw no Lepidodeudrou near Tambo or at the head ot
the Indi but fossil wood occurr'd at Tambo Bluff, where it bad also
been found by Mr. John Wilkinson and Mr. Tyers, then engaged
in their survey; before 1850, and in a letter written in that \ ear,
about twelve months before I visited Omeo, the latter spoke of
the Bind! and Buchan limestones as mountain limestone, which
I mention merely to show that others beside myself had at that
time the same impression respecting the Sedimentary deposits ot
The subsequent investigations by Mr. Howitt proved that the
deposits in question were Middle Devonian.
My obiect in referring to this otherwise unimportant matter
has been to explain the last passage in the note below (quoted
from the last Edition of this memoir, as it appears in ? Mines and
Mineral Statistics of New South Wales," 1875, p. 161, and which
was accidentally, left incomplete.*
These references and quotations bear upon the possible
relation of Lepidodeudrou to the Devonian Marine fossils in the
localities mentioned.
Mr. Hewitt?s Eeport is very valuable on many accounts, he
has made out with considerable precision the actual sequence ot
the Devonian beds over a large area, and places them not only
as they should be above the Silurian, but as having once
* Note ?ln Queensland, the Burnet Eunge, the Mount Wyatt District, and
tracts about the Bowen Gold Field and Burdekin (on which river limestones
with fossils occur), are strewn with spoils ot a formation which Mr. Daintm
calls Devonian. From the former locality I have had many collections, and
among them all I find Produetus in alliance with Tnlobites which appear
to be older than Carboniferous. On the western flanks of the Coidille
near Yass, and on the eastern along the Shoalhavcn River, and again near
the Hanging Rock, New South Wales presents numerous bands of limestone
full of such fossils; but it is doubtful at present whether these he on the
horizon of the Devonian, or whether they belong to some portion of the
Upper Silurian. As these beds appear to range all through the country on
a nearly meridional strike on both sides of the Cordillera, they are D-aceab c
in widely different places; and it may eventually be determined, that
though iii close contact, there is really a distinction of formations only to 1 e
detected by accurate survey. So far as Lepidodendron is concerned, that
plant occurs in some places in association with beds that are decidedly
lounger than anv called Devonian, near Fallal on the Horton River, and on
the Manilla River in Liverpool Plains, and in the gold-drift of the luron
River which has been derived from beds of transmuted sandstone
belonging to the Coal-beds at the head of the river. It occurs thus on Dan-
>rera Creek Yalwal. Near Wellington, also, Lepidodendron has been found
?n hardened rock of similar origin. At Canoona Gold Field 1.1 Queensland
Lepidodendron occurs in hardened shales; and at GOOllOO Goonoo, on the


occupied a very much wider area than at present over what is
now called North Gippsland, the Upper Devonian having
occupied the whole of it. He seems to have assigned the Snowy
River Porphyries in some localities to a position between Upper
Silurian and Middle Devonian. The Porphyries are considered
generally as Lower Devonian, resting as they do on Lower
Palaeozoics or Granite.
Under the circumstances detailed, there was no great heresy in
considering the deposits hastily observed, as I then supposed them
to be, as Lower Carboniferous, which was the oldest Sedimentary
deposit then known with any certainty; and Mr. Howitt, in
18/5, admitted that there is in Gippsland a passage from the
Upper Devonian into the Carboniferous beds. ?We find,? he
says, ? that the materials of which the groups are composed are
threefold?coarse conglomerates, sandstones, and shales with
occasional beds resembling * cornstones ? in their calcareous
character. No such unconformity is probable between the
Upper Devonian and Carboniferous as between the former and
the Middle Devonian.? (p. 237.)
The characteristic lossils in the Bindi limestone are Spirifers?
such does not appear to be the case in the Tambo series, nor is
Lepidodendron apparently known there, the Avon River more to
the s.e. being the chief habitat of that plant.
Mr. Howitt has, I think, clearly shown that the Bindi beds
are below the Tambo. As to the Porphyries, they seem hi places
to belong to the Granites (which at Moatnba, in N.S.W., are
stanniferous), and occupy a very prominent feature on the long
Peel River, in New South Wales, it occurs in line gray sandstone, with Ferns
and Sigillaria in close proximity to beds of Marine fossils which are as old as
Lower Carboniferous. It occurs also about 10 miles N.w. of Goulburn, and
Devonian Marine fossils arc known to exist not very far off in the County of
Argyle. It has been reported also on the Warrego River.
Besides these fossiliferous evidences of supposed Devonian age, there are beds
of grit, sandstone, and conglomerate occupying positions of extreme doubt-
fulness as to age, not only in Victoria but also all along the coast ranges of
New South Wales, which, as described by me and confirmed by Mr. Daintree,
are certainly older than some parts of the Carboniferous formation. They
make a near approach to the ? Old Red ? of Europe. In my ? Report to the
Government of New South Wales''? (6th March, 1852), I have mentioned that
I had traced these beds from the head of the Shoalhaven to the head of the
Genoa? ; and Mr. Daintree, in his Report to Mr. Selwyn, Director of the
Victorian Survey (26th May, 1863), adopts my description, word for word,
as applicable to ? the Grampian sandstones, the conglomerates south of
Mount Macedon, of the Avon River and Tambo, Gippsland?; and he adds,
? there can be little doubt they are all members of one great formation.?
At Mount Tambo, according to Mr. Selwyn (1866), they underlie the
limestone of that locality, which he therefore considers as probably Carbon-
iferous ; and this, as stated above, was my view in 1851. (From 2nd. Ed.
pp. 8-9.)


descent of .Jacob's Pass to the Tongaro Piver. In 1851 I con-
sidered the Granites and Porphyry to be Devonian, and I know
now from my own researches and the revelations of Mr. Howitt
and others that bedded Devonian rocks may be traced at
intervals in a somewhat direct course from Gippsland to ihe
County of Phillip. _ _ ?
There are several important deductions in Mr. Howitt?s paper
which there is no space hereto consider. It will be of great value
to any one interested in the study of the Palaeozoic formations
of Australia, especially the relations, supposed or real, between
the Middle and Upper divisions of them.
I cannot refrain from noticing here the service rendered to
this question by my friend C. S. Wilkinson, F.G.S., who has
lately brought out a map, under the auspices of the Department
of Mines at Sydney, of a tract of country intimately known to
myself during the last thirty-seven years, and previously alluded
to (p. 17), showing the geology of Hartley, Powenfells, Wallera-
wang, and Pydal, and the relations ot the Pipper and Lower
Carboniferous, Devonian, and in part Upper Silurian formations,
together with Granite, &c., in that part ot the County of Cook
which surrounds the Western Pailway from Hartley A ale to the
County of Roxburgh. It was in this area that 1 first found
gold in February, 1841, and in which (and recently in Mi.
Wilkinson?s company) I have renewed my researches in geology
from time to time.
As it belongs to the topic immediately in hand, I consider it
only a duty (after so long an acquaintance with the country
delineated) to testify to the general accuracy of the details, and
the carefulness with which they have been expressed. It is the
first work of the kind which has emanated from this Colony, and
is at once a proof of the skill and honesty ot the author, and a
credit to the country. This map alone will serve to refute the
absurd statement made in ? Progress Report of ihe Geological
Survey of Victoria ,? No. HI, 1876, p. 02, that ? Devonian rocks
have not heen discovered elsewhere in Australia than in A ictoi ia !
without referring to De Koninck?s account of the numerous fossils
of that age collected before 1850 in various parts of New South
Wales, and which in the very year (1876) when the dogma was
proclaimed ex cathedra had been described, figured, read before
an eminent Society in Europe, and proclaimed by publication to
the world!! {See Appendix XV.)
� 4. Upper Paljeozoic.
Notwithstanding the opinion expressed respecting L. not hum,
I do not however affirm that Lepidodendroid plants do not
occur in our Lower Coal Measures, as I have for years affirmed it,


and even L. nothum may, for anything I know to the contrary,
ascend to them and belong to botlv Upper and Middle Palaeozoic!
In the section on the Devonians facts are mentioned which show
that such plants are well known in our Carboniferous beds, and
there are numerous others which can be easily established. '
Other acknowledged Lower Carboniferous plants are also
known, though denied in no very gracious spirit some years since.
Professor M?Coy, as we have scon, doubted it, and De Zigno
accepted the doubt; but the plants are here nevertheless, and
were not manufactured out of Mesozoic specimens.
Mr. Leo Lesquereux, of Columbus, Ohio, whose reputation is
sufficient authority, was good enough to examine two carefully
photographed examides from the Eouchel Eiver which I sent to
Professor Dana, and pronounced one to be L. dichotomum and
the other L. rimosum of Sternberg.
Professor De Koninck also found embedded with the Marine
fossils of my collection from the Lower Carboniferous of Muree,
Glen William, Burragood, and the Kama, various well-known
plants, such as L. veltheimianum (Sternb.) ; Bornia radiata (A.
brongn.) ; Calamites vai'ians (Germar) ; Schizopteria (sp.), &c., &c.
Dr. Feistmantel (Paleontologist to the Geological Survey of
India) has also recognized in the strata from Smith?s Creek,
Stroud, Ehacopteris (first found there by me in 1850) ?
Teniopteris, (near) JSckardi (Germar); Cyclostigma Kiltorka-
num; a Pal&ozoic Sphenophyllum, with Glossopteris, which also
occurs in some of the other Lower strata, as at Muree, &c.,
Lcpidodcndron, &c. (? Records of G. S. of Indiaf jSTo. 4, 1870.)
I privately learn that Dr. P. thinks the species of Rhacopteris arc
A-ery near to E. iransitionis (Stur) and R.flabellifera (Stur) [=
Cyclopteris ineequilatera (Gopp)] and near to Spheuopt. Homeri
from Eothwaltersdorf in Silesia ? Culm.
I have now sent additional specimens to Calcutta, and the
question of Otopteris from Arowa will be settled which I have
written Avith (?) as reported from Stroud, it being quite possible
that Ehacopteris may occur in each locality. (See Appendix A'.)
One object in quoting these data will be served by comparing
them Avith the extracts in the note below. *
* The Baron de Zigno having stated in 1860 that the Indian strata with
fossil plants belonged to the ? Lower group of the Oolite,? adds This
would not be the case with those of Australia, if the observations made in 1847
by the Eev. Mr. Clarke Avere confirmed, for he mentions in these deposits the
presence of the genera Sigillaria, Lcpidodcndron, and Stigmaria, which
Avould settle the question. But lam not aware that the facts thus cited have
been since verified. On the contrary, no mention is made of these genera in
the works of Messrs. Moore and M'Coy, in which wo arc presented with a
series of forms which, together with local types analogous to those of India,
there are species which recall the Jurassic flora of Scarborough.? [? Some
Observations on the Flora of the Oolite. By Baron A. de Zigno,'' Q.J.G.S.


Having personally compared with specimens from Kiltorkan
(in my possession) the SyriTHjodendvon dichotomum (of ML. C ai-
ruthers?s paper before referred to) which I sent home to England
some years since, and which is yet in the Geological Society s
Museum, let me add that I found it in company with the
Lepidodendron nothum and some other casts of plants in the
year 1852. .
I would remark, that in one locality in Tasmania 1 collected
many individuals of a species of so called Syringodendron, which
occurred in the Coal Measures at the base of bpring Hill, on the
slope of which hill Strzelecki stated that he found in beds of sand-
stone Fccopteris odontopteruides underlying the Pachydomus
globosus , known to Professor M?Coy as a Wollongong Lower
Carboniferous shell. It is only fair to add, that though I maae
in two different years a close examination of the hill and the
surrounding district, I failed to recognize the shell, though I saw
much that reminded me of the geology ot certain parts of the
Hunter Kiver Coal formation, and of the Illawarra, of the age of
which there is little doubt. I have lately learned that at least
two Marine fossils above the plants have been found on bpring
Hill. ? ,
On the borders of the Devonian formation in parts of the
Hunter and Manning Hiver basins, the Lower Carboniferous
which is highly inclined passes on along the same strike into beds
charged with 'Lepidodendron, Kuorria, iSiyillcivia , <&c., and 111 some
instances Lepidodendron occurs in the same blocks with ? Ofoptens
oveda of M?Coy, an example of which was shown in the Exhi-
bition at Sydney in April, 1875, from the east ot Stroud. On
the ranges at the head of the Peel, and about Booral, Stroud, and
Scone, occur numerous fragmentary blocks with Lepidodendron,
Sigillaria, and other usually associated fossils of Carboniferous
beds.
These and other facts of similar kind have been.often stated
by me on former occasions. They are referred to on this, in
order to show the relations of the New South Wales formations.
At present many of the points where the Upper and Middle
Palaeozoics meet are ill-defined, and it will require the researches
and labours of many years to fill them in with strict accuracy.
xvi, p. 111. ] In reply to this, and to some very remarkable attempts by
another critic to show that I had made out my Palaeozoic species fiom frag-
ments of Mesozoic plants (on which I do not choose to comment), I confine
myself to one further extract from a paper written by me in 18G0, and
published in March, 1861 ? I placed years ago in the Australian Museum
at Sydney, specimens of these disputed plants, and in the present year I saw
one of the species in the University Museum at Melbourne, which had been
found in Gippsland. [? On the relative Positions of certain Plants in the Coal-
hearing Beds of Australia: Py Rev. IV. P. Clarice, M. A.., F.O-.S. ; Q.J.U.S.
Ixvii., p. 355.]


JS'or can it be wondered at, that in so large a territory, and with
such complicated and broken features, details must for a long
period to come give way to generalizations. That the two fo�
mations seem to have a passage from one to the other is pointed
out by numerous instances in this Colony; and it may be illustrated
by the occurrence of Bornia radiata (see p. 30), which is one of
the distinguishing fossils of Schimper?s ? Epoque Paleanthraci-
tique" intermediate between the two (see Tome iii p. 620), as well
as by Ehacopteris which is so common at Smith?s Creek, Stroud ;
nevertheless, M. De Koninck considers the mass of the Lower
Carboniferous Marine beds he has described to represent only the
I pper and Middle Carboniferous of Europe. Other instances of
like kind could be pointed out of passages from the one formation
to the other. And this I have endeavoured to establish in relation
to connection of our Coal-seams on the Hunter and elsewhere
with a Palaeozoic series through the occurrence of genera of plants
which have generally speaking a Mesozoic character.
One aim of my labours in Australia has been to show that we
have a succession of groups passing upwards so as to present
collectively one great series of Coal-bearing beds, instead of an
interrupted widely separated series of formations which have no
connection with each other. The question between Professor
M?Coy and myself was precisely of this character. He has held
that, ??no real connection? exists between the beds under the
Coal and the Coal Measures themselves ; but that ? they belong
to widely different geological systems, the former one referable
to the base of the Carboniferous system, the latter to the Oolitic,
and neither showing the slightest tendency to a confusion of
type.?
It is quite true that there may be succession of formations one
over another without any ascertainable break ; and there may be
also in any given series of deposits of one age interruptions and
partial dislocations, marking time in the deposit of "the strata
without any actual change of epoch ; and in cases there may be a
want of parallelism or ? conformity? in the beds of one and the
same group , and it is conceivable how plants that have
grown in one age in one country may be found to have grown at
another age in a distant territory, without the means of our
tracing the missing links in their connection. And, therefore,
such plants as Pecopteris TVilliamsoni might be found in China,,
or in Australia, as well as in Yorkshire, with or without any
inference as to oneness of epoch ; and very much discrimination
and labour may be necessary to discover that the plants are
identical and have collateral evidence, derived from the corres-
pondence of matrices, clays, sands, or shales in which they are
imbedded, that they grew near where they are found, under the
same actual climatal or physiological conditions.


It is this required proof which renders it, in some cases, no
wilful scepticism to call in question the identification of any
plants ; and it may bo questioned whether any of our fossils are
capable of such complete identification as to make their recog-
nition a matter of positive certainty. On the other hand, even
in organic remains of Marine origin there may be difficulties ot
another kind. Wc need only refer to the very interesting
report of the meeting of Members of the Geological Society of
France at Roanne in 1873,* to see how a plant, noticed above
(.Bornia radiata ), occurs in the Coal-beds near Roanne, in a
variety of deposits all apparently of one formation, which M.
Douville shows to comprehend in itself two distinct and
independent formations, exhibiting singular and extraordinary
concordance and discordance, owing to certain physical derange-
ments which bring as it were the strata of Sarrebruck Coal-field
and that of Saxony into Central France, and, at the same time,
according to M. Do Rouville, exhibit a concordance between the
Coal formation and the Permian, and discordance between the
mountain limestone and the true Coal-beds without mixture of
the flora. After well considering such a condition of things as
this, one should be very cautious in the matter of stratification,
especially in a country so distant from Europe and America as
is Australia. It was my lot to pass through the district in
question in 1825, and I still retain impressions of the geology,
so far as I noticed it; but I regret that I did not know it, as I
now find, to be in many more points than those just mentioned
like that of some portions of our Australian Coal-fields. A
more striking instance of the conformity of stratification of
widely separated formations may be found in a memoir of
Casiano de Prado, ? Sur Vexistence de la Faune Primordiale
dans la chaine Cantabrique," read by M. de Verneuil before tlm
same Society, on 7th May, IB6o,?in which is shown a section of
vertical rocks perfectly conformable to each other without the
slightest break, Lower Devonian rock and Red Sandstone with the
Devonian fossils side bv side and on both sides of a band of
Lower Silurian, as determined by Barrande and De Yerneuil,
whose descriptions of the fossils is given in the memoir. The
whole of the rocks mentioned, which are succeeded by carbon-
iferous strata equally vertical, wore considered at one time to be
Devonian. On this most instructive example M. Barrande
makes the following excellent remark, which will be sufficient
apology on my part for calling attention to the necessity of
carefully examining the Stratigraphy as well as the Palaeontology
of the rocks in Australia, ?? This example is so important in its
results that it deserves to be cited in the number of those which

|)rovc how the mutual aids ought to wait on each other, of the
two principal branches of Geology, that is to say, Stratigraphy
and Palaeontology. Their comparative application could only be
despised by minds prejudiced and disposed to sacrifice the
progress of science to the ephemeral maintenance of their exclu-
sive and systematic views,? ?the conclusion of the paragraph 1
leave in the original, ? Des esprits si etroits ne se trouvenf pas parmi
nous.? [? Bull. Soc. Oe'ol. de France ,? 2*' ser. xvii, p. 543.]
In the course of my work I have had to contend with the
prejudices of some who have never visited this territory, and who,
from a distance of many hundred miles, have ventured to
dogmatise, solely from a palaeontological point of view, without
caring to ascertain how far the strati graphical evidence is at
variance with their conclusions.
In consequence of this the ascending order of formations
above the Lower Carboniferous in this Colony has long been
disputed by some, whose unacquaintance with facts patent to all
who have examined them is the best apology for a more temperate
style of criticism than has been adopted.
We are, however, indebted to Professor M'Coy, for ascer-
taining, in 1847, the existence of eighty-three species of animal
remains in our Carboniferous formation, in a collection forwarded
by me to the University of Cambridge, in which the Professor
was then officially employed.
Before that time, Bowerbank, Sowerby, Morris, and Dana had
determined the existence of the Carboniferous Marine beds ; and
the latter author enumerates about eighty species observed
? luring his excursions in New South Wales, in some of which I
accompanied him. {See Appendix II.)
More recently Mr. Etheridge has described fifteen species of
Lower Carboniferous fossils from Queensland, in relation to Mr.
Daintree?s paper oil the geology of that Colony, of which ten
were furnished by myself. None have yet been discovered in
Victoria. In Tasmania, Mr. Gould figured some well-known
forms from that Colony, but the plates were never published.
lie has noticed also, what I have contended for, that the
worked Coal-beds of the Mersey River belong to the same forma-
lion with Palaeozoic Marine fossils, as in Queensland and on the
Hunter River.
Having visited the Tasmanian locality for the purpose of
inspection, I can confirm all that has been stated respecting the
occurrence of the Palaeozoic fossils, Orthonota, Spirifera, Fenes-
tella, Pachydomus, Theca, &c., in association with and immedi-
ately above the Coal ; and lately I have been officially informed
that Coal-seams have been found by piercing these beds on the
Don River, confirming my grounds for recommendation to look
lor them.


In Western Australia traces of these Marine beds have been
detected and announced by Mr. Gregory. And in extension of
the formation northwards beyond the limits of Australia, it is
well known by more than one observer that Carboniferous beds
exist in the Island of Timor, where Beyrick discovered several of
our New South Wales species, e.g., Spirifer lineatus, Sp.,
Tasmaniensis, Productus semireticulatus, P. punctatus, Sfc.
(?Acad, des Sciences de Berlin ,? 1861.)
My own collections received in 1871 from Queensland some
interesting additions, which arrived too late to I'orm part of the
contribution to the Daintree Collection.
Among these fossils, from the head of Bee Creek (Fort Cooper),
I find Pecten, Spirifer, Trochus, and magnificent specimens of
Productus, and a variety of usually associated shells, and with
them in the same brown ferruginous grit and shale-beds well-
depicted Glossopteris, and some other plants, one fragment of
which appears to be of a Dictyopteris.
This mention of Glossopteris will lead to considerable discus-
sion respecting its occurrence in beds interpolating in the Marine
fossiliferous strata, as well as occurring in the shales of the Coal-
seams on the Hunter Fiver and elsewhere in New South Wales
and in Queensland.
Mr. Daintree, F.G.S., (? Notes on Geology of Queensland ,?
Q. J.G.S. xxviii, p. 286) gives a section from the Coal-seams near
the Nebo Crossing of the Bowen Fiver, of Coal-seams with frag-
ments of Glossopteris underlying Productus and Spirifer beds
several hundred feet thick, with abundance of other Carboniferous
mollusca, the strata being upheaved by porphyry, and the lower
beds resting upon it. The beds are ? quite conformable.? At the
junction of the creek the argillaceous Marine beds are surmounted
by others consisting of ? coarse grits and sandstones with inter-
stratified shales. In these the impressions of Glossopteris are very
common and sometimes beautifully preserved ; but,?.? he adds, ? I
have never been able to find the fauna and flora unmistakeably
represented in the same bed.?
This admission as to that particular locality has been used
against the evidence of the beds themselves as to their position
by the author of ? Beport of Progress by B. B. Smyth, No. I Ilf
1876, p. 59, who states that ? any misapprehension in regard to
the age of the Mesozoic Coals of New South Wales, probably, is
due to the accidental or apparent conformableness of the Meso-
zoic strata to the underlying Carboniferous (Paljeozoic) rocks? !!
In addition to the evidence from the junction of Nebo Creek and
Bowen Fiver, Mr. Daintree cites, with a section, the facts
observed at Pelican Creek, where he shows ? Marine beds resting
directly on a Coal seam.? ?At the base of this cliff a seam of Coal
about 4 feet thick crops out the entire length of the section.


Directly upon tins rests a coarse-grained sandstone, with a few
imperfect casts of shells ; while at the top of the cliff an
arenaceous limestone hand holds abundant specimens of the
Streptorhyncus crenistria so common throughout all the Lower
Marine series.? (p. 288.)
Here we have in addition to Glossopteris below Marine beds,
Coal also below them, and lower down Glossopteris in the sand-
stone and shale ?facts quite in keeping with what has been so
clearly shown by myself in parts of the Hunter Eiver basin in
Hew South Wales.
In further confirmation of such evidence, I will now quote an
extract from a letter by Mr. Daintree, dated ? Mary vale, North
Kennedy (Queensland), January 22nd, 1870. On the M c Kenzie
Eiver, near the junction of the Isaacs, the Coal Measures are
highly inclined, Glossopteris the common fossil; but running up
Eoper?s Creek they gradually become horizontal, and at the top
of the Eoper?s Creek watershed horizontal beds of sandstone and
sandy limestone are the only rocks exposed in section full of
Hunter Eiver fossils, Producti , &c. * * * I could only be more
assured than ever that the Glossopteris beds underlie these hori-
zontal Productus beds, and a week spent in surveys would
altogether settle the matter. I see Hector gets Glossopteris
associated with Mesozoic fauna in New Zealand ; I am satisfied
we have it with Palceozoic Carboniferous fauna.?
Speaking of the valley of the Comet Creek, Leichhardt (? Over-
land Expedition ,? pp. 101-5) says he met, on January 9-10,1845,
with sandstones in the deep gullies running to the creek and on
slight elevations ?? Sandstone crops out in the gullies of the valley
in horizontal strata, some of which are hard and good for build-
ing, others like the blue-clay beds of Newcastle, with the
impression of fern leaves identical with those of that formation.
At the junction of Comet Creek and the river I found water-
worn fragments of good Coal and large trunks of trees changed
into ironstone. I called this river the ? M?Kenzie,? ?in honour
of Evan M?Kenzie.
It is so far certain that the Newcastle beds underlie the Marine
Carboniferous near the junction of the Comet and M?Kenzie.
Gregory found the remains of Leichhardt?s camp on 17th
November, 1856, but records no geological data at that spot
(J.E.G.S., xxviii, p. 128). But W. Lockhart Morton (? Notes on
Northern District of Queensland,? Trans. Phil. Inst. Victoria, read
23rd January, 1860) noticed the Coal in large angular blocks at
the junction. In another spot some distance from the junction
and on the M'Kenzie he observed ? in a stratum of sandstone an
angular piece of beautiful bright Coal embedded ?proving that
this piece of Coal is of greater age than the sandstone and than
the seams of Coal which that sandstone overlies.? (p. 13.)


Respecting Mr. Daintree?s evidence, may be added here the
extracts from two letters from that gentleman to myself (which
were published by me in a paper on ? Marine Fossiliferous
Secondary Formations in Australia ? (Q.J.Gr.S., xxiii, p. 11) :
? Bowen, February 10, 1866.
?In the Bowen Eivcr Coal-field, your statement as to the
Palaeozoic age of the Newcastle beds is, so far as I could judge,
entirely proven , since we have Spirifers, &c., similar to those in
Eusseil?s shaft and the railway section at Maitland overlying the
Coal-seams, Olossopteris being the most abundant fossil fern.?
? Brisbane, April 11, 1866.
? I send you a copy of what Professor M?Coy addressed to me
after an examination of the fossils I took him, viz.,
? Your brown beds No. 2 are identical with the Marine beds
underlying the Coal of the Hunter [i.e. overlying the Stony Creek
Coal-seams. ?W.B.C.], ?the Productus hrachythcerus, Sfc., Sfc.,
fixing them. The Streptorhynchus is new, but of clearly carbon-
iferous type. I have no doubt of their being Upper Palaeozoic.
? The plants are Phyllotheca Australis and Olossopteris Broicn-
iana, forms related to which in Europe are only found in Mesozoic
rocks.? ?
As to Lepidodendron, I have no where asserted that the
Lepidodendron, Sigillaria and other plants of that class have been
found in or over the beds of Newcastle or at Wollongong, though
I have mentioned already the possible discovery hereafter ; but I
have asserted many times that such plants occur in some parts
of our Coal Measures, and that below the Marine fossils which
underlie the Upper Measures Olossopteris occurs, and others
which have been by some considered solely of Mesozoic age ; and
I have therefore argued that there is ? a connection,? which has
been denied, the denial in my opinion having arisen from want of
personal experience on the part of my opponents, though I have
given them the same credit I take to myself, viz., that we each
and all come to conclusions to which we are led by our individual
acquaintance with or ignorance of facts. That some of the
doubters have contented themselves with passing sentence without
sufficient inquiry is distinctly stated by one of them in a Parlia-
mentary document, from which extracts will be found further on.
I refer now to the ? Progress Report from the Select Committee
on Coal Fields ,? Melbourne, ordered to be printed, 20th October,
1857, and to the Evidence under questions Nos. 461, 471, 577,
581, 582, 584, 586, 588 to 592. No one who peruses that
evidence will deny that it was upon preconceived Palaeonto-
logical determinations alone, without the condescension of a local
research, that positive dogmatic dicta were declared as law with a
wilful resolve to over-rule any opinion in opposition. Mr.


Carruthers, whose judgment none perhaps would rashly call into
question, in the discussion which ensued upon the reading of
Mr. Dam tree?s paper (op. cit.), argued that ?With regard to the
supposed Grlossoptens and Tseniopteris Epochs, which by some
had been regarded the one as Palaeozoic and the other as
Mesozoic, he was not convinced that they could be distiuctly
separated, but thought rather that they might belong to different
portions of one great period. * * * * He thought that
neither was oi a date earlier than Permian.?
The conclusion I have all along held is, that
erous strata, and those which it pleases dissidents to fancifully
designate as ?Carbonaceous? (which is, at the best, a misnomer),
are parts of one great series, and that the beds which contain
Mesozoic Marine fossils may be properly placed in still higher
stages ot the Palaeontological edifice.
In noticing my opinion expressed in 1861 (in a paper ? On
liccent Geological Discoveries and Correlation of Australasian For-
mations with those of Europe"), Sir Eoderick Murchison (? Address
iQoif u i j ; i Association at Manchester," Sept. sth,
ibbl), holding the view of a possible double series, stated that
re, ' clve(l a communication from Mr. Gould in which he
(Mr. Cr.) says, that in ? Coal-fields of the rivers Mersey and Don
one of the very few which are worked in Tasmania, he has con-
vinced himself that the Coal underlies beds containing specimens
ot true Old Carboniferous fossils,? and adds ?that in Tasmania at
least the Coal most worked is unquestionably of Palaeozoic a ire,?
(p. -3.) In this Mr. Selwyn (Q.J.G.S., xvi, p. 147) fully
concurs. J
in the paper on which the above comments were
made i had expressly affirmed, that reviewing the whole dis-
cussion I was willing to admit, ? that though some of our Coal
appears to belong to the true Carboniferous epoch, yet it is
possible that some may belong to the Permian epoch as sug-
gested by Mr. Dana for the Newcastle Coal, or to the Triassic
as suggested for the Indian and Virginian Coal; but I am not
yet li. e, in 1861, nor am I now, 1878] convinced that our New
oouth Wales Coal-seams are of Oolitic age.?
My highly respected friend Dana at one time abandoned the
Permian for the Trias, and Dr. O. Feistmantel of Calcutta is
labouring diligently to support this view in opposition to those
ot Dr. ( Udham and Professor Blanford. ( See p. 62.)
But the question is still an open one, although the Oolites are
insolvent; aud_ if all our N. S. Wales Coal is not somewhere
between the Trias and Palaeozoic, or at the top of the latter, in an
intci mediate Palaeozoic stage not known in Europe, it will require
strong faith and stronger affirmation to cast it all into a Mesozoic
receptacle, notwithstanding the possible reliance of my Victorian


friends and critics on one or both of the assertions that there is
no connection ? between the Newcastle Coal and the hase of the
Carboniferous? (which may be true as far as the base is con-
cerned), or that it is ? not older than the Trias, nor younger than
the Oolite? ?so that if the Trias wins, Oolite is no where! Q.E.D.
Those who deny the asserted age of our workable Coal-seams
affect to rely on the assumed age of that most prominent plant,
Glossopteris Browniana. They say Glossopteris is an Oolitic
genus, ? Exactly as in the English beds the Glossopteris is associ-
ated with Tceniopteris?? i.e., in the assumed Oolitic series. To this
we may reply, that ? Glossopteris Browniana ? which is ? the
Glossopteris? alluded to in the above extract from the ? Report
of the Three Commissioners on the Western Port Coal-fields,?
(p. 8), is a plant utterly unknown in Europe and America, and
only known in India, South Africa, and Australia; and that Taeni-
opteris, which is said to be associated with it in English beds,
according to Schimper, the most recent expounder of Eossil
Botany, is a genus which has only five species, all of which are
Permian, i.e., of Palaeozoic age or of Upper Carboniferous. Even
if one Tseniopteris should be found in the same beds with
Glossopteris, that fact would not invalidate but would rather
strengthen my argument. Since the former js Palaeozoic, and the
latter occurs in the Coal-seams below the beds which are filled
with Lower Carboniferous Marine fossils, it is clear that those beds
and the plant they hold must certainly be Palaeozoic, whatever
becomes of any other part in the succession of the series or
group to which they belong. It was attempted to be shown that
there exists an inversion of beds at Stony Creek, where five
seams of Coal holding Glossopteris, under 143 feet of acknow-
ledged Palaeozoic Marine beds, occur (the fossils from which I
sent down to Sir Henry Barkly, who submitted them to Prof.
M?Coy), and to meet this I requested that a geologist might be
sent up from Victoria to test the facts. Accordingly Mr. Gain-
tree came, and in th Yeoman,? a Melbourne journal, No. 100, will
be found his refutation of the inversion story and a full con-
firmation of my assertion. This circumstance is ignored by the
Commissioners of 1872, as are all others that do not fall in with
the imagination of certain critics in Victoria. But I may now
add that Glossopteris in Coal-seams below the Marine beds has
been found in other localities, as for instance at Greta, where the
Coal has been reached below more than 400 feet of Marine strata,
Glossopteris and other plants also occurring 2 feet 6 inches above
the Coal. (See Sections No. 1 and No. 2at the end of this
Memoir .)
Not only so, but it is found in sandstones elsewhere, amidst
the Marine fossils themselves, and in the very same portions of
rock with the latter. So that no reasonable doubt ought to exist


in the mind of an honest controversialist that ? Glossoptei'is?
does occur as early as the so-called Lower Carboniferous strata,
and therefore our Coal-seams have a right to be held of that age.
Now Schimper, to whom I before alluded, considers that the
Indian, African, and Australian plants are merely varieties of
the same G. Broivniana. In India no Marine fossils have yet
been found in connection with its Coal plants ; and in Africa the
Glossopteris is not set down to any older formation than Triassic
by Mr. Tate; but even that is older (although Mesozoic) than
Oolitic, to the latter of which M?Coy refers them. And if Grlos-
sopteris has a range as extensive as some other fossils which pass
through three separate series of strata, why might not it pass up
into Secondary rocks, without denying its existence in Australian
Middle or Lower Carboniferous? There it clearly does not
govern, but must be subordinate to the Fauna. But it is not
alone in that position: other plants also occur therein which have
as much an Oolitic facies as itself. And yet it is undoubtedly
true, as is well shown by Daintree, that in Queensland Grlos-
sopteris is confined to beds that are in association with Palaeozoic
fauna, and that the so called Tseniopteris is found to accompany
a Mesozoic fauna; and 1 can aver, after thirty-nine years
experience, that up Marine deposits of Secondary age have yet
been discovered in New South Wales, although in "Queensland
beds of Coal occur in supposed connection with such.
There may, therefore, be two epochs of Coal as suggested by
Murchison or as stated by Mr. Carruthers two portions of one
series, without dispossessing the lower portion of its right to
hold a property in a plant that may not have existed in the time
of the younger part of the series. Whatever be the value or
uselessness of reasoning on the point, this fact still remains?
Glossoptcris Broivniana does exist in New South Wales and in
Queensland in Coal Measures that interpolate strata full of
Paheozoic Marine fossils; and is absent in the latter Colony, where
the Marine accompaniments are called Mesozoic, and does not
exist at all, so far as is yet known, in Victoria, where the Palaeo-
zoic and other Marine beds are at present missing.
As to the division arbitrarily made by Professor M?Coy, in a list
re-arranged by him of Mr. Keene?s specimens, separating ? Shale
with G. Broivniana and Otopteris ? from the Palaeozoic beds, that
excellent Palaeontologist may be assured that a plant apparently
the same as Otopteris (? ovatd) is combined with Lepidodendron,
Ehacopteris, and other plants near Stroud; and that at Greta,
and at Mount Wingen, Glossopteris is found below his own
determined Palaeozoic Marine fossils, the smoke from the
burning seams full of the plant at the latter locality passing up
through cracks in the overlying conglomerate full of Palaeozoic
shells, &c.


Nor does the arrangement made of Mr. Keene?s collection
ao-ree with the actual facts in nature, for the Greta beds are not the
uppermost with Marine fossils, but beds with them lie further to
the east ?in which Phyllotheca has occurred at Har pur?s Hill, and
Glossopteris in the same way at Muree near Eayinond Terrace.
There is another item to be taken into account ?the occurrence
of fishes ?one in the Newcastle seams, described and figured
by Dana, viz., Unsthenes Australis ; and many of different species
in the beds above the Coal Measures, of which mention will be
made hereafter.
The greater part of them are fragmentary, but others are
entire. Some specimens exhibit the head, others the tail or
hinder portion of the body, and one jaw has been found with
teeth which are not shown in the other fishes. One has within a
few weeks (January, 1878) been found in shale at Balmain, near
Sydney, whilh is shaped like Belonostomus ; but the scales are
not shown aid the caudal fin is too indistinct to be traced, the
vertebral colimn and some of the ribs are better defined, but it
is out of slape, and can be merely guessed at. Only half of
the body wai found in digging a well, and the remainder was
searched for. at the desire of Mr. Wilkinson, E.G.S., and myself,
and has beei with difiiculty discovered.
Of these ishes, Palmoniscus was recognized by Sir P. Egerton,
from Parranatta and the Gibraltar Tunnel, between Nattai and
Bowral, am one species assigned by that learned Icthyologist is
P.antipodeu. He considers the fishes to be Permian (Q.J.G.S.,
xx). Profesor M?Coy also has admitted that they have ?a
general aspict of Triassic or Permian fishes.? (? Official Record,
1866-7, Mehourne Fxhib.,p. 169.?) . .
Some reent writers have called in question the claims ot
Palieoniscu! to any Carboniferous rank. In a learned paper by
Traquair?Q.J.G.S, xxxiii, pp. 548-578. ?On the Agassizian
qenera- Arnhupterus, Palceoniscus, Gyrolepis, and Pygopterus. By
'Ramsay H. Traquair, M.D., F.8.5.F., F.G.S., Keeper of the
Natural-Hitory Collection in the Fdinburgh Museum of Science
and ArtT lead May, 1877)? the author, great detail and
illustration, comes to the conclusion that the fishes named are
not Carbonierous but Permian.
This detemination does not interfere with the view I have
maintained f the Palaeozoic age of some at least of our Aus-
tralian CoaMeasures, which is half supported by M?Coy, wholly
by Egerton, nd again confirmed by Dana. Mr. W. J. Barkas,
L.E.C.P.L. ,nd M.E.C.S.E., in a paper read before the Eoyal
Society of lew South Wales, 3 Dec., 1877 ?(? On a Dental
peculiarity ogthe Lepidosteidce ?) ?devoted himself to a considera-
tion of the dubtful character, as he considers it, of the fishes,
by Sir P. Egrton, viz., Paheoniscus, IJrosthenes, and Myriolepis.


Mr. Barkas says there is no description o� TJrosthenes. This
is, however, given by Prof. J. D. Dana, in the ? Geology of the
TT. S. Exploring Expedition 1838-1842, under the Command of
Captain Wilkes, TT.S.JSt.? (New York), p. GBl. His chief ground
of inquiry is respecting the teeth of these fishes, as he considers
the Lepidosteidae are distinguished by the teeth being ? tipped
and, unfortunately, as in many instances in Europe, the New
South Wales fishes alluded to show no teeth whatever. But, as
stated in the last edition of this memoir, p. 39, ? the last specimen
of fish from the Palaeoniscus beds, reported by me to Sir Philip
Egerton, was a portion of a jaw of a fish whose teetli were of a
Saurichthyan type, but the learned Icthyologist comidered it also
to be Permian.? The teeth in this specimen were to completely
? tipped? in the way mentioned, that I considerd it to be a
Saurichthys (see Agassiz, ? Poissons Eos sites f vol.ii, tab. 55a.),
and named it as such, under correction, to Sir Philb.
The objection of Mr. Barkas may therefore be tonsidered as
answered; although the fish to which the jaw bebnged is not
precisely known, Mr. B. says, ? from the Avritings of Professors
Owen and Agassiz, I learn that Sauricthys is alsc tipped with
enamel,? (op. cit., p. 205). As he admits, moreove?, that of the
eighteen genera Lepidostean which he cites, ten art ? tipped,? it
is probable that the Ganoid fishes discovered by ne, were also
? tipped,? though no teeth have been found. I was not present
at the reading of the paper by Mr. Barkas, and die not read it
in print till 9th February, 1878, or I would have replied at the
time.
The peculiarity of the teeth in Permian Ganoids vas long ao-o
pointed out by Dr. King (See ? Monograph of the Penman Fossils
of EnglandPalceont. Soc., 1850, p. 228, undei Platysomus
macrurus, p. xxvi, 1.)
Then, as to the ? vulgar error ? that heterocercal ;anoid fishes
are confined to Palaeozoic beds, ?which any one acqiainted with
ordinary treatises on the subject may be supposed t< understand
is an error, though scarcely ? vulgar ? in the Quinary sense
of that often offensively used term, ?surely it may e permitted
to conclude from the fact that among all the fishes iscovered in
our Coal-beds, and in the beds the Coal, not rsingle homo-
cercal tail has been found, the probability is, as P. Egerton
has surmised after examination of those submittecto him, that
th efsites are Palceozoic, especially as the admissions made that
? the homocercal structure is not known in Pala>zoic rocks.?
(? Report on Coal Felds." Victoria, 1872, p. 6.)
The fact that the Coal-beds overlie or interpolae the Marine
beds in Avhat is called ? conformable order,? ougt to be con-
sidered a satisfactory conclusion that no break sua as ought to
exist under other circumstances does exist, becaus Avhether the


Coal Measures are horizontal or inclined they merely follow the
same condition in the Upper or Lower Marine beds with which
they are always associated.
The argument from the occurrence of fish remains is met by
the incidental remark that the ? heterocercal ganoid fishes being
of genera and species peculiar to the locality have no value? in
determining the age of the beds in which they occur, may be
met by the retort that if peculiarity is to be a guide in deter-
mining geological age, there is an end of any certainty for such
persons as affect to uphold their own theories by reference to
peculiar plants ; and this Professor M?Coy himself does in rela-
tion to a Scarborough plant by which he affects to guide his
Oolitic determination to the exclusion of Glossopteris and its
usual associates.
Respecting Palamniscus, one of the New South Wales fishes, a
passage translated from Agassiz, whose decision ought to be
satisfactory, will not be out of place, considering that it meets
the objection on the form of the caudal fin. He says, ?? I know
ten species of this genus, which appear to be limited to Coal
Measures and the Zechstein. It might not, however, be impossible
to discover traces in the Ores higarre',* the Muschelkalk, and the
Keuper ? (i.c., in the Trias); ? but that which I believe I am able
to affirm is, that it does not ascend to the Jurassic formations, of
which the numerous representatives of the order of ganoids have
the tail regular, and never prolonged in a long point forming the
upper lobe of the caudal, as takes place constantly in the genera
of the earlier formations. Ido not understand what were the
intentions of Nature which have produced these singular
differences, but it is certain that they exist, and it would be to
misunderstand our duty to ignore them, or to attribute less im-
portance to so general and constant a fact.? (?Recherches sur les
Foissons Fossiles ,? tom. 1, p, 43.) To this may be added, that the
generality of the fishes in N. S. Wales are heterocercal;
*He afterwards names P. catopterus as belonging to this sandstone. It
was, however, only found in one spot, only ? a few square feet? in extent, in
the county of Tyrone : ( Portloclc: ? Geology of Londonderry, Tyrone, and Fer-
managh, p. 468.?) Respecting this fish, Dr. Traquair says (Q.J.G S. xxxiii,
p. 565, op. cit.) ??This little species from the Triassic red sandstone of
Rhone Hill, county of Tyrone, was originally named by Agassiz, hut was not
described by him. Sir C. Lyell, however, in referring to it in connection with
certain Ameincan Triassic forms, says, concerning it,? 1 The Irish Paheorpscus
catopterus of Roan or Rhone Hill, referred by Col. Portlock to the Trias, is
a true Paheoniscus, and not allied generically either to the Ischypterus of
Egerton, or the Catopterus of Rcdfield (Q.J.G.S., iii, p. 278) ; and in Sir
P. Grey-Egerton?s brief description of the species (Q.J.Gr.S., vi., p. 4) occurs
the following passage, ? 1 The dorsal fin is placed much nearer the tail than
in any other species ; in this respect, but in no other, P. catopterus resembles
the genus Catopterus of Mr. Redfield. The tail is decidedly heterocerque


though in some instances the caudal fin is not so distinctly
pronounced as in others, which may therefore be classed as
? semi-heterocerque.? But Palaconiscus well developed as to
the tail was found in shales and sandstone 1,000 feet geologi-
cally above the worked Coal-seams.
The existence of Palaeozoic strata of Carboniferous age in
some parts of \ ictoria is, as I believe, a fair assumption of the
Cape Paterson Eeporters, though at present they cannot prove
their position by fossiliferous evidence; but the denial of that
existence would hand over their whole Coal-territory to a forma-
tion or formations to prove the age of which they have no more
marine evidence than they have respecting a Carboniferous era.
They have never yet seen a single Marine fossil bed in all Victoria
to justify even their adopted view of their Coal belonging to the
Oolitic age, which is elsewhere multitudinously fertile in Marine
fossils, and this, no doubt, is ? peculiar.? The Eeporters on the
Western Port Coal-fields notify carefully, that ?it should be
distinctly understood that our opinion respecting the age of the
Kew South AVkles Coal Measures is based entirely on the collection
of rocks, fossils, and Coals forwarded to us by the late Mr. Keene,
and on the published reports on these Coal-fields.? But even this
is accompanied by a sneer at Mr, Keene?s alleged blunders in
Palaeontology.
On the above I would observe that, as I had seen the collec-
tion referred to before it was despatched, I am prepared to say it
did not completely represent the beds in the local district from
which it came, and was only a partial display of the series of
the strata in association with Coal throughout the Colony; and
that in the arrangement adopted by Professor M'Coy, as quoted
in the Eeport, most important portions of the beds are omitted.
I would, therefore, attribute the ? opinion of the Board res-
pecting the age of the New South Wales Coal,? so authoritatively
pronounced, to be based on imperfect data, showing that the
gentlemen who then decided the question are 'practically ignorant
of the true grounds of decision, clearly not having made any in-
spection for themselves, and totally ignoring the opinions of the
host of observers who have certified to the contrary ; amongst
whom is Mr. Daintree, a member of the Victorian Geological
Survey, the late Mr. Stutchbury, who reported thereon, as well as
many others who have studied the strata in situ, and are true
witnesses against the side of the Oolitical party. In the pleadings
on that side, the reliable evidence that makes against them is
? burked.? and a foregone conclusion is offered as if it were final
?and the judgment is delivered ex cathedra , whilst numerous
witnesses of the first credibility are altogether ignored. This
may be prudent and ingenious, but it is not ? scientific ,? nor is it
honest, yet it helps to bring out the magnificent declaration:


�?We confine ourselves to tlie statement that we have not before
us a particle of evidence indicating that the Coal-seams now being
worked in New South W ales are of Palaeozoic age.? A great com-
pliment this to persons who have laboured lor years to establish
truth ; but thev may console themselves with the reflection, that
? Prejuqer est mal juger.? Amidst this lamentable ingenuity to
? tell the truth without telling the whole truth and nothing but
the truth,? and in the arraying of evidence Irom beyond Austra-
lia instead of collecting the whole evidence furnished from itself,
there is one grateful exception which, though not entirely satis-
factory, is much more so than some previous proceedings were.
It would have been better to have acknowledged that old
opinions had been re-called.
In the notes on Mr. Keene?s specimens, Professor MLoy,
though he draws a line where it ought not to be, has changed his
method of putting his old opinions about the Coal itself, inasmuch
as he no longer makes use of the notion which he once enter-
tained and put in evidence before a Committee of the Melbourne
Parliament. I must explain this ; On the 20th November, 1857,
he was examined (as the Chairman of a Mining Commission) on
the Character and Extent of Coal in Victoria, and he asserted over
and over again that no Palaeozoic coal existed in Australia, ihe
following answers speak to that point;
?722 (Answer). The members of the Mining Commission have an impres-
sion that, as the Coal deposits to be expected there [Cape Paterson] geologi-
cally are not the same as those of the great Coal-fields of England, but are of
similar character with the Coal-deposits of New South Wales and Tasmania,
therefore it is unlikely that they will be of commercial value-, and as scientific
men they would not on their own responsibility, recommend the expenditure
of public money there. , . ? -. e .v. rt
727. (O.) Considering that the information [? formation] of the Cape
Paterson Coal-fields is similar to those of New South Wales and Tasmania,
you are of opinion that as an economic question you would advise no lurther
prosecution of any surveys in that locality ? (A.) That is my opinion. _
744 (0 ) You would not advise the prosecution of any further inquiries
for the discovery of Coal ? (A.) No recommendation to that effect would
emanate from myself or the Commission. , .
747. Such Coal-fields [ i.e ., those of Paleozoic age] ,do not exist in this country
[i.e. in Australia]. That is a point which I wish clearly to show, and i think it
is one which has never been clearly shown to this Committee before.
758. I know you are not to expect the old Palaeozoic Coal-fields in this part
759. (O.) Do you contend that the Mesozoic Coal-fields are not suitable for
the different purposes of commerce ? (A.) They are not so suitable as the
Palaeozoic, they are not so extensive, the beds arc not so thick or workable,
nor is the quality so good over any workable area. , ...
767. (Q.) If a Coal-field at Cape Paterson was discovered equally good with
the Sydney Coal-fields, would you consider it worth working ? (A.) My in-
dividual opinion is that it would not he worth working.
771. [Of Cape Paterson] (A.) Of course the Members of the Mining Com-
mission do not wish to attach any scientific weight to their evidence in a
commercial point of view, they merely choose to say, that as men of science,


no recommendation -would emanate from them to undertake extensive works
there, because the utmost you could expect would be such a Coal-bed as you
have at Sydney Once more ; 769 (By Captain Clarke.) (Q.) The Virginian
Coal-fields of the character you describe as being similar to those here are
worked at 775 feet depth ? (A.) Yes j but the beds there are not to be com-
pared to the Palaeozoic Coal beds.?
The witness here expressed an undoubted fact, but seems to
have forgotten entirely in November, 1857 the evidence he had
given before the same Committee on 18th August of same year.
Void ! By the Chairman :
474. (Question). The Committee desire that no time may be lost, and also
to know what aid the Mining Commission can afford them in the prosecution
of their inquiries?Are you prepared to offer any facilities for that purpose ?
(A.) I have obtained some specimens from surveyors from the Avon Ranges,
m the Gippsland district, which is the first evidence that the Palaeozoic Coal
of Europe exists in the Colony. One is a large specimen of Lepidodendron
indicative of this ancient Coal, so that my own opinion is that the principal
Coal-deposit to be expected in the Colony would probably extend from the
Cape Paterson beds northwards through the Gippsland country, and pro-
bably form a union with the Sydney deposits. The Hunter and Hawkesbury
deposits of Coal are the finest specimens I have seen of that period. There is
reason to expect that deposits of both those geological ages will be found
to exist there, so that if arrangements were first made for geological explora-
tions of the Gippsland district valuable results might follow.
Strange to say, however, neither the expectation in 1857 of
Coal of the older epoch, nor the denial of its value in favour of
that of a ? more recent age? after the explorations of a host of
skilled surveyors in Victoria, nor the excursive labour of the ex-
perienced Examiner of Coal-fields from New South Wales has
yet realised either anticipation in that Colony.* The latest report
* In 1857 the Report from a ?Select Committee upon Coal-fields? was
ordered, on 2nd October, by the Legislative Assembly of Victoria to bo
printed. How, in the evidence given by the witnesses we find the folio wine-
recorded : 6
Alfred R. C. Selwyn, Esq., further examined :
5/6. (Q) By the Chairman. ?V ill you be good enough to read that
letter (handing the following paper to the witness) ? ? Extracts from
Professor M'Coy?s letter of the 30th September, 1857, to the Honorable the
Chief Secretary. * * * It is desirable to state plainly here the opinion
of the Mining Commissioners relative to the expense of trials for Coal, which
is, that the richest deposits to be expected in the accessible parts of Victoria
would resemble those of Sydney and Tasmania, with this difference, that
while the latter are situated most advantageously for the employment of
water carriage and cheap labour, the localities in which such deposits may be
expected to exist in Victoria are so placed in both these
respects, that even if similar rich Coal-beds were to be discovered, the public
would not be likely to receive any benefit, as the supply could be more
cheaply brought from the neighbouring colonies.? (A.) I concur in all that
is stated there, except that if numerous thick seams of largo extent and good
quality were proved to exist, they must be worked to advantage.
577. (Q.) That professes to be an extract from the report from the Minins
Commission? (A.) Yes. b


I have seen respecting ? Kilcunda and Cape Paterson? is from
Mr. Cowan, Mining Surveyor, dated 2nd August, 1875, who,
after considerable examination and collection of available infor-
mation, comes to the conclusion that ? very little can be deduced
with certainty in regard to either the character or extent of the
Kilcunda and Cape Paterson Coal-deposits except by actual
experiment. The pick of the miner, will in my opinion, be the
only conclusive test.? (?Progress Report No. Ill," 1876, p. 279.)
But the money spent, and the labour bestowed on investi-
gations and search for Coal in Victoria has been enormous, and
it is a subject for deep regret that her enterprising Colonists
have not been more successful, as a valuable and abundant
Coal-field in that Colony would have been, of whatever geologi-
cal age, most beneficial to thousands of the present and future
occupants of that interesting territory.
The old Coal-beds, as well as what the Southern scientists are
pleased to call ? Carbonaceous? strata, are equally unpromising,
and Mr. Howitt shows the reason ?because they have been
greatly denuded.
578. (Q.) You are a member of the Mining Commission ? (A.) I am.
579. (Q.) Did you sign that report ? (A.) No.
580. (Q.) How are meetings of the Mining Commission called? (A.) The
Mining Commission consists of Professor M?Coy, Mr. Panton, the Resident
Warden at Bendigo, and myself. Mr. Panton is hardly ever in town ; I
could not say how many meetings he has attended, but very few; and no
regular meetings hare ever been called. Now and then I go up to the
University and discuss these matters with Professor M?Coy.
581. (Q.) By Mr. O' Shxnassy. ?ln sending in a report from the Mining
Commission to the Government, is it the practice to obtain the consent of
the other members of the Commission ? (A.) Not formally.
582. (Q.) That is, the document is not sent to them P (A.) I have seen
the document; in fact I wrote the report myself with Professor M'Coy, he
dictating and I making suggestions, and then it was subsequently copied by
a clerk, I suppose under Professor MCoy?s directions, and I have seen it
published in the newspapers ; but from the time Professor M'Coy?made the
rough draft of it I have not seen it; whether it was ever sent to Mr. Panton
I am not aware.
584. (Q.) Does that document meet your views now ? (A.) There are
some portions of it which do not meet my views.
586. (Q,.) By the Chairman. ?l wish to ascertain precisely as to the
constitution of the Mining Commission, you say it consists of three gentlemen,
namely, yourself, Professor M'Coy, and Mr. Panton P (A.) Yes.
587. (Q.) Mr. Panton resides at Bendigo ? (A.) Yes.
588. (Q.) So that practically you and Professor M'Coy are the Mining
Commission ? (A.) Yes.
589. (Q.) Is it usual to hold meetings of the Commission ? (A.) Not formal
or regular meetings of which minutes are kept; we meet occasionally and
discuss things in a manner that I have all along considered was not the way

But putting aside all commercial considerations, and returning
to the question of epochs, we find the Reporter on the Cape
Paterson Coal-fields appealing to China for proof that Coal with
G-lossopteris and other associated plants in New South Wales
cannot be Palaeozoic, and in direct contradiction to the opinion
of the Palaeontologist of Victoria, as stated in the reply, No. 759,
(quoted in p. 43), that Mesozoic Coal is not be compared with
Palaeozoic, treating somewhat neglectfully the value assigned to
the Cape Paterson Coal by the Board.
In the Report on the Coal-fields of Western Port, 1872, there
are quotations from a letter of Dr. Newberry to Professor R.
Pumpelly, the original of which is given in the Appendix to his
Geological Researches in China, Mongolia, and Japan (? Smith-
sonian Contributions to Knoidedye? vol. XV., Washington, 18G7,
p. 119). The letter is dated from Cleveland, Ohio, September
25th, 1861. I think the quotations ought to have been expanded,
and some words restored to what they are in the letter itself. I
will, therefore, refer to that document more fully than I did in
the last Edition in which I quoted from the report of the Vic-
torian commentator.
Mining Commission and with the authority of the Mining Commission?
(A.) I should not consider myself competent to do so; that is all I can say
about it.
591. (Q.) With regard to the particular report from which that is extracted,
did you ever see the report from which that is an extract ? (A.) I never
saw it when it was finished.
592. (Q,.) I allude to that letter ? (A.) I never saw that letter.
638. (Q.) Professor M?Coy in reply to a question states in his
examination on the 18th August, with regard to the Cape Paterson Coal-
fields : ?? That a shaft should he sunk, &c., &c.? Are you prepared to
state the cost ****** * besides, there you have the abso-
lute certainty that there are good beds of Coal ? (A.) You see that Pro-
fessor M?Coy gives evidence about Cape Paterson, but the fact is he has
never seen the place. He has never been out of Port Phillip Bay in that
direction. The only evidence he gives is from what I described to him
about a place. He has never seen the place, so that a person cannot gene-
rally give evidence about a place he has never seen. I have walked the
coast from the Bass Elver to Anderson?s Inlet, past Cape Paterson, a
distance of about 40 or 50 miles.
Broderick M?Coy, Esq., F.G-.5., examined, 18th August, 1857 :
461. (Q.) By the Chairman. ?You mention the Cape Paterson Coal-fields.
Have you any information respecting them ? (A.) Only a report in
former years, and specimens from those beds.
462. (Q.) Have you examined them ? (A.) No, I have not. The speci-
mens show them to be identical with the beds of Van Diemen?s Land and
Sydney.
471. (Q.) The Committee would be glad if you will state from the evidence
that presents itself, whether you consider that Cape Paterson Coal-field is
most likely to be a large and useful bed for commercial purposes ? (A.) Oh!
certainly.


Several species of plants are described by Dr. Newberry, and
assigned to either a Triassic or a Jurassic age, leaving that age
undetermined (from want of sufficient evidence) in a large part
of the great Coal-fields of China, basing his ? conclusion on the
entire absence of Carboniferous plants from the collection, and
the presence of well-marked Cycads, species of Podozamites and
Pterozamites closely allied to if not identical with some hereto-
fore found in Europe and America.? Pie then says the ( oal
basins you visited are all Mesozoic, and not Carboniferous.
Towards the close of his letter he arranges the plants in four
divisions, assigning them all with the exception ot one plant to
Triassic beds, the exception being one Podozamites, which
? resembles ? a European Jurassic plant, the other apparently being
? identical with an American Triassic species.? There is also
a Pecopteris having a remarkable likeness to P. Whitbyensis,
(which on comparing Pumpelly?s figure with those given by
Lindley and Hutton and A. Brogniart, I should hesitate to say
is actually identical with the Scarborough species?though all
the figures have some resemblances to each other), and which
Mr. P. says is too imperfect to determine accurately. _ There are
other plants, but the balance is with by far the majority, with
Triassic beds in Europe, North Carolina, Virginia and Mexico.
A few new plants are also mentioned.
When, therefore, such statements are cited to prove the
Oolitic or Jurassic character of our New South Whies Coal, we
might reasonably expect to find that the prominent plants in our
Coal Measures have a place in the Chinese Coal Measures seeing
that the latter are brought out in evidence to weigh down all
opposition to the preconceived opinion on the subject age.
But what do ice find? we find the following in the heart of Dr.
Newberry?s letter.
?We have of course no right to assume from the interesting
facts your explorations have brought to light, that no Carboni-
ferous Coal exists in China, for it may very well happen, that as
in our own country Coal-seams of economical value, but of
different ages, will be found there, at points not greatly removed
from each other. But geologists will not fail to be deeply
interested in the fact, that so large portions of the Coal-basins of
China, including beds of both anthracite and bituminous Coal ?
worked for hundreds of years, probably the oldest mines in the
world ?are wholly excluded from the Carboniferous formation.
So large a Coal-bearing area, indeed, that when joined to the
Triassic, Cretaceous, and Tertiary Coals of North America, they
quite overshadow the Carboniferous Coals of Europe and the
Mississippi Valley, and suggest the question, whether the name
given to the formation which includes the most important
European strata has not been somewhat hastily chosen. Another


interesting feature in the fossil plants under consideration is the
re-appearance at the far distant point from which they come of
genera so well known in European and American geology, and
the entire absence of the species of Phyllotheca, Glossopteris, Sfc.,
which have made the Indian and Australian Goal-floras so puzzling
to the palaeontologist. There are fragments of a new generic form?
probably a Cycad in the collection, and some obscure specimens
that may represent other plants new to science, but the Pecopteris ,
Sphenopferis , Podozaviites , Pterozamites , Sf c,,-have a very familiar
look, and their resemblance to well-known forms gives fresh
evidence of the monotony of the vegetation of the Globe previous
to the introduction of the angiospermous forests of the Cretaceous
epoch.?
I may be allowed to quote here another extract from Mr.
Pumpelly himself on the subject of ? Jurassic Coal.? He says,
on p. C 2 of his ? Geological Researches" ?? Were there fossiliferous
strata of the Jurassic or Cretaceous ages (i. e. in China), their
petrifactions would be found in all parts of the empire, used as
curiosities and as medicines, as is the case with the fossil Brachio-
pods and Orthoceratites. This is important evidence in China
where art is based on the remarkable or rather strange in nature.
* * * With regard to the Coal-bearing rocks, I have supposed
the Coals to belong to the same age throughout the empire , excepting
a few which seem from their names to be Tertiary brown Coals.?
Now, reconciling the quotations, if we can, from Professor
M?Coy?s evidence as to the value of Paleozoic Coal, and the
inferences of the ? Report of the Victorian Coal Board" from the
letter of Dr. Newberry and the extract from Mr. Pumpelly, what
is to be done with another passage in p. 9 of that Report ?
In it the Reporter having arranged the order of our New South
Wales beds (no doubt, conscientiously enough) after his own
says ?If their view be correct, it is not likely that seams
of Coal as thick and as persistent as those occurring in the
Dower Mesozoic beds of IN ew South AVales will be found in any
part of "V ictoria. It is to be regretted that a geological exami-
nation was not made ol the Northern Coal-fields, during the many
years the Victorian Government maintained a staff of geological
surveyors, for the purpose of ascertaining by comparison the
position of our beds with all the exactness practicable.?
?The value of such evidence as the geologist and the palaeon-
tologist can give in such investigations as these is priceless. They
alone can determine where the practical miner can pursue his
explorations with fair chances of success.?
Thus speaks out the modern Delphi ?-but what becomes, after
all, of the expectation of the anticipated Mesozoic Coal-beds of
Victoria, and what must Mr. Daintree, who was one of the staff
spoken of, think of the way in which his success in carrying out


the investigation recommended at Stony Creek is rewarded, when
that very important work is totally ignored by the Palaeontologist
of the Survey, by whom all the specimens collected, sent to him
by me, were examined, and who now has had his eyes so far
opened as to acknowledge that some ?Palaeozoic? Coal does exist
in New South Wales ? *
# In reference to the above remark the following passages from ? Geological
Notes, with Plan and Section, by Richard Daintree, Field Geologist,
Victoria,? may be properly cited :
? From Newcastle to Stony Creek is but a short trip, and as these are
sections on which Mr. Clarke bases his evidence of the Palaeozoic age of part,
at least, of the New South Wales Coal-seams, it is one of the necessary
pilgrimages of the wandering geologist in search of truth. What I saw there
I will state in as few words as possible. I saw three shafts on Mr. Russell?s
estate?ladder shaft, working shaft, and 200 feet shaft.?
He then gives his measurements, which are not material to cite in this
place, and goes on?
? When the details of these shafts were first made known by Mr. Clarke, as
a proof of the Palaeozoic age of the Coal, Spirifers, Fcnestella, &c., being found
in abundance, and Glossopteris associated with and below the Coal, it was
suggested by Professor M?Coy that the data given by Mr. Clarke showed the
existence of a fault between ? working ? and ? 200 feet shaft,? and that
possibly to this fault the reversion of beds might be due, but the Palaeozoic
character of the fauna was not called in question.
? This error arose from taking the absolute distance between the shafts
(360 feet), instead of the reduced distance to the line of dip 280 feet.
?Referring to the extension of Russell?s Coal-seams to the Northern Rail-
way, unfortunately at a point where no marked bed of Russell?s series can be
absolutely identified? [but at that point may be identified both plants and
Marine fossils and traces of Coal in the strata there disturbed], ? we have an
apparently unbroken series of strata dipping in the same direction, and at
about the same angle, as those in Russell?s Coal-pits, extending from a point
at 19 miles 73 chains from Honeysuckle Flat to 21 miles 37 chains from the
same place, the beds furthest to the eastward dipping at a greater angle.
? This affords a thickness (taking the angle of dip at 16 deg.) of 2,365 feet
of strata, abounding in fossil fauna from bottom to top ?very Iqw down in
which Coal-seams with Glossopteris occur.
? Fossils from each of the cuttings on the Railway and from Russell?s shafts
were procured, that Pahcontologists may satisfy themselves of their European
parallel.
? If it be admitted that the fauna found in the upper strata of these shafts
is Paheozoic, then these Coal-seams at least are Palaeozoic, and Glossopteris
has a much lower range than has hitherto been assigned to it, except by Mr.
Clarke. *
?Neither does there seem any reason why Mr. Clarke should not place the
Newcastle Coal-seams (his No. 3 Carboniferous group) in the upper portion of
this Stony Creek group, no known unconformity existing, since no fauna or
flora typical of the Mesozoic period has, I believe, yet been found in the said
No. 3.
? This brings me to the consideration of Mr. Clarke?s present arrangement
of the Carboniferous series of New South Wales :
? First.? ? Wianamatta? beds, with insignificant Coal-seams, the upper beds
of which are the probable equivalents of our Otway, Bellerinc, and
Wannon beds, in which Glossopteris has not yet been found.


As to the fact of changing an opinion on conviction
wrong, he who so changes is not to be taunted with it unfairly]
and I do not advance it except to acknowledge that so far as the
Professor has gone he deserves respect and honour for the change.
My only complaint is, that he has not gone far enough; though
alter what he and his colleagues announced in the examination
above referred to, respecting the sole Mesozoic character of our
New South Wales Coals, it is refreshing to find him writing in
these terms of the Greta and Anvil Creek Coal-seams,?? The
beds from to (referring to his re-arrangement of Mr.
Keene?s specimens) are clearly the Marine Palaeozoic Carboniferous
rocks, and the Coal found with them resembles the Goal of the
Southern Coal-fields of Ireland of the same age." But he adds?
without compunction or authority:?? Neither this collection,
nor the sections, nor Mr. Keene?s collection in the Melbourne
Exhibition, bear out the notion that the Grlossopteris and Phyllo-
theca alternate with the marine Palaeozoic shell-beds.? Now had
? Second?? Hawkesbury? beds, with insignificent Coal-seams ; no Gloss-
opteris. To this series Mr. Clarke refers the Grampian sandstones of
Victoria, though Mi'. Selwyn places them with No. 4. (By Grampian
sandstones I mean the beds constituting the Sierra.)
Third. ?? Carboniferous? beds, containing the workable Coal-seams, with
Glossopteris, by far the most abundant fossil. In the lower portions of
this series four (? five) known Coal-seams are interpolated with strata
containing a fauna similar in character to that found in the Carbon-
iferous limestone of Europe.
? Fourth.? 1 Lepidodendron? beds, not associated with Coal-seams, as far
as yet known.
? If this arrangement is correct ?and my experience as a field geologist is
entirely in its favour?it is of great practical value to us in Victoria in the
search of workable Coal-seams, &c., &c., in the hope of finding the Gloss-
opteris beds. It points unfavourably towards the Tamiopteris and Zamites-
bearing beds, which we have hitherto regarded as our Coal-producers, but
which as yet have yielded nothing better than the Cape Paterson seams. ?
? Four thousand feet also of these same beds have been tested by boring in
the Bellerine District, and have yielded nothing approaching a workable seam.
All the facts that we have to guide the field geologist in Victoria, in his
search for Clarke?s No. 3 Carboniferous beds (containing the workable seams
of New South Wales) are these,?that they are very low down in the Carbon-
iferous series ; that the lowest beds contain a fauna nearly allied to the Lower
Carboniferous of Europe ; that Glossopteris is associated with all the Coal-
seams, and is the most common and characteristic fossil of the said No. 3.
This peculiar fauna or flora has not yet been observed in Victoria.?
(From ? Yeoman and Australian Acclimatiser,? August 29, 1863, No. 100,
published at Melbourne.)
It will be unnecessary to point out to any unprejudiced reader how Mr.
Daintree s ?Notes? cited above, known as they must have been to the
? Reporters on Coal-fields, Western Port,? nearly nine years before, contrast
with their lamentation in the year 1872, about the ? non-comparison ? by
Victorian surveyors of the position of the Coal-beds in the two Colonies, ?with
all the exactness practicable.?


;i visit been paid by him to the localities of Rix s Creek, or to
Anvil and to Stony Creeks, or to Mount Win gen, such an assertion
would not have required fresh denial from me ; and to jump from
the Wallsend seam to Rix?s Creek and Anvil Creek without any
examination of the section of the intermediate localities, or to deny
the existence of Glossopteris at those and other places among the
Marine beds which are so interpolated, is to do away with the u hole
merit of such a section as the ? Notes pretend to represent.
Since the date of Mr. Daintree?s visit, Mr. C. S. Wilkinson,
E.Gr.S.. another first-class member of the same staff of excellent
geologists on the late Victorian Survey, has succeeded to the
office�of Geological Surveyor in New South Wales. It may be
sufficient to quote one sentence on his authority : The collec-
tion of fossils from near West Maitland, Greta, and Am il C reek
includes Spirifer, Conularia, Inoceramus, Productus, Eenestella,
Bellerophon, Crinoidal stems, &c.,obtained from the Tipper Marine
beds 350 feet above the Anvil Creek Coal-seam, from which seam
I collected the specimens now shown, containing the Phyllotheca
and Glossopteris Browniana? (? Mineral Exhibits? from Mines
and Mineral Statistics of New South Wales, 1875,? p. 133, for
Philadelphia Exhibition).
I will quote here an additional testimony to the facts already
declared, respecting the interpolation of our Glossopteris Coal in
the Marine beds. Mr. Odernheimer in his final report to the
Australian Agricultural Company, says: ?? The lowest Coal-seam
at Wollongong rests on older spirifer and is covered by
sandstone, with Pachydomus shells and a few Spirifers, (p. 38.)
I have paid more attention, perhaps, to the ? Report on the
Western Port Coal-fields of 1872,? than it deserves; but as it
contains specific allusions to myself, and in fact is an attack on
the evidence I have conscientiously given on the subject of New
South Wales Geology, it is only just to that Colony to show that
the conclusions arrived at in that report are ? based as much on
personal ignorance respecting our territory, and a pre-determi-
nation to disbelieve the statements of men quite as much entitled
to be believed as the writers of that report themselves, as on
anything else. lam thoroughly persuaded that if such personal
investigation on his part had taken place, an old correspondent
and assumed friend of my own would not have dealt with my
writings as he has done.
The advocates for the Oolitic (or as now called, Mesozoic) age
of our Coal plead the cases of Richmond in America, and India, as
well as China; Africa is unnoticed. It will be fitting to produce
evidence on each head.
China. ?Mr. Pumpelly is the only authority quoted by the
Victorian Board, who make him to have in 1862-65 found 111 the
Coal-beds fossils proving that ? those beds are geologically of the


same aye as the Victorian, Neic South Wales, Tasmanian, and New
Zealand beds,? p. 8, and Professor Newberry is quoted as identify-
ing these fossils as those characteristic of Triassic or Jurassic
ages.? (See ante, p. 46.) In the ?Ocean Highways ? for Nov.,
1873, Baron von Richthofen says, the Pumpelly observations were
only very limited in extent, and his map an hypothetical one made
up from native reports, ?in which he attempted to exhibit among
other data, the distribution of the Coal Measures in China.?
? The favourable result at which Mr. Pumpelly arrived, in respect
to the great extent occupied by Coal-bearing strata in China was
modified in some measure by the sometohat unsatisfactory conclu-
sion drawn by him, from the determinations by Dr. Newberry of a
few vegetable remains, that all the Chinese Measures are of the
same age as the Triassic formation of Europe,? (p. 311). The
Coal of China, however, found a highly qualified expositor in
Baron You Richthofen himself, who from 1868 to 1872, made
journeys nearly all over China, and found Coal-fields of enormous
extent in many districts, nearly every one of which he personally
visited, as he tells us in various publications.
He mentions one seam of Silurian age ; several others in
Devonian strata ; but he adds ? the great bulk of the most widely
distributed and most valuable Coal-beds are 'proved by numerous and
very characteristic Marine fossils to belong to the true Carboniferous.
After the close of that epoch the deposition continued without
interruption through the Permian, till probably towards the close
of the Triassic epoch.?
These are his own words, and he justifies his determination of
epochs by informing us, that ?he first determined with some
accuracy the geological age of the Sedimentary formations by a
great number of prolific fossiliferous localities.? Nowhere in
this account of his do we find mention of Oolitic or Jurassic Coal.
So that really China should not be quoted to uphold the ? same
group as the Gape Paterson series ,? (Report, p. 5). Rather might
it uphold the Coal of New South Wales. If Marine fossils are
? necessary,? none exist in Victoria as we have already seen and
as the Report allows.
The following passages from a notice of Richthofen?s discoveries
concisely meet the facts he had developed, in the Provinces of
Liao-tung and Shan-tung : ?? Tutti questi strati sono apparen-
temcnte quasi parallel! fra di loro, e subiscono soltanto un leggiero
cangiamento di inclinazione indicante il graduale passaggio
da un livello geologico ad un altro. Sarebbero queste localita
importantissime a studiarsi, giacche sembra che vi esista la
iutiera serie Paleozoica dal Silurico al Carbonifero. Tutta
siffatta serie e fortemente disturbata da roccie eruttive, e segnata-
mente da graniti e da porfidi; la massima intensity di queste
eruzioni si verificherebbe nei dintorni di Pechino.


?La formazione Carbonifera di Pecbino ba uno sviluppo stra-
ordinario.? [? B. Comit. Geolog. d'ltalia, Bulletino 9?lo, 1871,
p. 234.?j ? Presso il lago Poyang il deposito scistoso, ora
accennato, e ricoperto da regolarissimi strati Carboniferi, fra i
quali sono intercalati alcuni straticelli oalcarei ricchissimi di
bracbiopodi in perfetto stato di conservazione. Questa fauna
diiferisce essenzialmente da quella che vedesi associata al carbon
fossile nelle provincie nordiche della China: il genere Productus
vi e prevalence per numero, ma il caratteristico P. semireticulatus vi
e scarso e rappresentato solo da piccoli individui Earissimi sono
gli esemplari di Spirifer, mentre vi abbondano ; crinoidi, i coralli,
gli spongiarii ed i generi Orthoceras e Porcellia : sonvi pure rappre-
sentati i generi Cyrtia, Orthis, Siphonotreta, &c.? [n/., p. 230.J
Mr. T. W. Kingsmill confirms these statements in his account
of the Greology of the East Coast of China, considering with others
that ?The Chinese Coal-fields may prove to be the largest in the
world, and at a future period will have an important influence on
the destinies of the East.?*
More recently, in 1873, a letter written to M. Daubree by M.
I?Abbe Armand David states, that in the district of Mieu-shien
Coal-beds exist in association with Marine Palaeozoic fossils and
so-called Secondary plants which the author describes as inter-
polating each other ?? Ce que je ne puis m?expliquer c'est
Texistence de ces calcaires durs cristallins au-dessus de la houille
et au-dessous, avec des apparences physiques, identiques, quoiqu?ils
soient separes par 100 ou 200 metres de marnes.? (? Full. de la
Soc. Geol. de France ,? 3 ser., t. ii., 1874, No. 5, p. 406.
Ho also states that on the mountain of Lean-chan, near
Han-tchong-fou, nearly 3,000 feet high, a grayish-white lime-
stone from 300 to GOO feet thick, having a dip of from 40� to
60�, forms the summit.
Below comes in a series of bluish, red, and yellow marls con-
cordantly stratified with the limestones, followed by red beds like
sandstone, the whole system abounding in fossils. Coal occurs
above the marl in contact with the upper limestone, which, as well
as the shales and clays, contains vegetable and shelly fossils.
Ad. Brongniart describes in the same number of the ? Bulletin ?
the plant remains to be Pecopteris Whitbyensis; tw r o Sphenopteris
* (Notice in ? Geologist ,? 6, p. 69, of a paper read before the Greol. Soc.
Dublin in 1862. Dub. Q.J.) In a valuable memoir, ?On the Geology of
China,? by the same author, we learn that besides Devonian, Marine fossils,
and Carboniferous beds containing Lepidodrendon and Sigillaria, and in some
places younger conglomerates, and red sandstones not unlike Triassic succeed
them, ? the Coal, at the latest, being Triassic.? In other parts, such as in
the Tung-ting system, he tells us that ? there is a striking resemblance
between it and the Devonian and Subcarboniferous rocks of the South of
Ireland?the same succession of grits and shales at the bottom, and a similar
development of limestone above, while the type of the few fossils found seems
likewise to approach that of the Lower Carboniferous rocks of Europe.?
(Q.J.G.S., xxv, pp. 119-138, 1866.)


of imperfect character; resemblances to Zamia distans and to Li/co-
podites Williamsoni; a probable Pnlissya and Bayern dichotoma
?the whole very near if not identical with those of the
Whitby beds. These come from Tin-Kiako, South Shen-shi. On
the other hand M. Paul Fischer describes M. David?s Marine
specimens from Lean-Chan as consisting : ?Firstly, of Crinoidal
remains Polyps and Bryozoa and Brachipods, as Orthis, Pfylo-
dicfya, Discopora, Heferopora. These he considers Wenlock.
Secondly, there is also a reddish or whitish sandstone with
beautiful fossils such as Productus ; Spirrfer ; Euomphalus ; and
Orthoceras ?the rock resembling that of Kildare in Ireland, and
Avesnes in France. The coral Michelinia and some others were
undetermined. ?It appears strange,? says M. Fischer, ?that
Upper Silurian and Carboniferous beds should occur together in
the same locality.?
M. Bayan also describes elsewhere in China, in Yang-Tsee-
Kiang, some drifted fossils of true Carboniferous species.
Whether the plant-remains do or do not belong to the same beds
with the Carboniferous Marine fossils as M. David says, or are
altogether younger, at any rate the Carboniferous fossils are
Paheozoic' and further researches may demonstrate a more inti-
mate relationship than now appears with the stratification and
paleontology of New South Wales. But if there are indica-
tions of Mesozoic formations in some parts of China (as shown
by Dr. Newberry), yet all observers confirm the fact that the
enormously developed Coal Measures are not Mesozoic but
Palaeozoic Carboniferous. Mr. Pumpelly?s view is that all the
older Coal over China is Triassic resting on no other Sedimentary
rocks, than Devonian. Those fossils of the latter epoch to which he
refers I have arranged in the table below, marking those which are
known to me to occur also in New South Wales and Tasmania.
There is an interesting passage in ? Siluria" (4th Edn., 1807,
p. 18) which may be properly cited. Sir R. Murchison says
therein, ?? It is also certain that the mountain-chains of China
are composed to a great extent of these older rocks ; for M. C.
Skatschkof, Director of the Russian Observatory at Pekin, when
preparing an account of the rich Coal-fields (partially described
by his countryman Kovauko) near that city, recognized, in the
Jermyn-street Museum, certain Silurian Gfraptolites and Ortho -
ceratites, Devonian Spirifers, and Carboniferous Producti, as all
being forms which he had seen in the rocks around the Chinese
metropolis.? He then mentions the fossils given to him by Mr.
W. Lockhart {see ? Address in R. Geogr. S. J.," 1858, p. 306) ? some
from the province of Szechuan and others from Kwangsi,? and
those brought by Monsr. Itier, and described by De Koninck as
Devonian. These are enumerated in the table. But there are
others of which at present I cannot refer to a description, nor
have I now Richthofen?s last work at hand.

Virginia. ?? The Coal Measures of Richmond,? says the Western
Port Coal Board, ? are stated by Sir C. Lyell to belong to the lower
part of the Jurassic Group.? Well! he did once say so, but he
found that he was wrong, and so he placed them finally in the
Trias ; Professor Heer considering that the plants have ? the
nearest affinity to the European Keuper.? (? Student's Elements
of Geol.f 1871, p. 302.)
Why cannot the Board follow a good example and condescend
to look down the line a little ? They flirt with the word
? Mesozoic? out of compassion for their ? first love? among the
Oolites, and are afraid to acknowledge they have a hankering
after a second idea, and so are unjust to it by their indecision.
Africa. ?In Africa, the association of the genera Glossopteris,
Phyllotheca, and Dietyopteris, ? affords some evidence of Mesozoic
affinities? says Mr. Tate, who, nevertheless, shows that the shales
in which they occur are not Jurassic but Triassic (Q.J.G.S.
xxxiii, p. 112.) Paheoniscus and some of the reptiles and an
encrinital stem might refer these Karoo beds to a lower position
still. Mr. Tate admits the analogy is with the Kcuper (p. 109).
The late W. S. Maclcay, Esq., P.E.S., always expressed his belief
that certain beds near Sydney belonged to some part of the
? New Bed.? And it is curious to observe, how many persons
who ? know what they are talking about,? some from above as
the Ooliticals, and some from below as the Permianites and
Upper Carboniferites, have found their battle-field on the ter-
ritory that was once intact as the ?New Bed,? but which
has been cut up and re-distributed since the early days of
our geological recruiting, after the fashion in political con-
tests. The defenders of the Palaeontological territory will
not, however, surrender at discretion, but will go in for a
final struggle, in the hope and intention of making their
case good until they have been proved mistaken. It is not so
much, however, for the love of the past discussion, as to contri-
bute to the history of it, that in this place, notwithstanding some
recent light has been thrown on the Palieo-botany of India by one
whose ability and knowledge are deserving of universal respect,
that the letter of my friend, Dr. Oldham (published in the last
Edition) will find a place in this, for it contains a concise view of
what was believed in India by those who used well all their
opportunities up to 2nd April, 1874 ; and if there is error in any
of its conclusions we shall have an opportunity further on of
comparing the antidote with the bane, and I would hesitate to
strike out unceremoniously from these pages the results of years
of patient and conscientious labour of one who has ? left his
mark? upon Indian geology, which cannot be erased without deep
ingratitude and deliberate injustice. By comparison of this docu-
ment with certain revelations to be mentioned in the next section


(on the Mesozoic or Secondary formations), the new discoveries
will he made plainer and the old rectified where they may have
been defective, and I may repeat, in giving a summary of the
Indian Coal-fields History as it was about four years ago, 1 shall,
I believe, involve no breach of confidence by doing what will save
the necessity of again searching the Memoirs and Hecords of the
Survey: ?
?We have seen,? lie savs, ?no reason whatever to alter our views uith
reference to the age of our Indian Coal-roeks. The plant evidence is tolerably
conclusive with us. Our Upper beds, which contain thin patches and tin eads
of Coal (and which we call Rajmahal formation), we have established, by a
careful research in Cutch, to be Upper Oolite. These are characterized by an
abundance of Cycadea and Tamiopteris, but not a single Glossopteris has
been found. Then we have the group we call the Panchet System, with no
Cvcads. Schizoneura (a plant first described from the Vosges), &c., and
with them Labyrinthodont and Dicynodont reptiles. No Glossopteris heie
? Then below these, with slight unconformity, occur the Coal-rocks, in which,
observe, we find Olossopteris Browniana abundant ; and this holds through
the several thousand feet of thickness, occurring in all.-
?At the base we have a small thickness (relatively) of the Talciieek
System, in which Cyclopteris shows, but no Glossopteris.
? Unfortunately we have as yet no animal remains from our Coal-rocks
Notwithstanding this, in connection with your evidence from Australia, and
bearing in mind the perfectly established identity of the Glossopteris, even
in its varieties, and the equally established fact that Glossopteris has nevei
been found in Europe , and therefore gives no clue or index to age from
European determination, I cannot come to any other conclusion than I have
done, that our Coal in India represents the latest portion of the Carboniferous
of Europe, and the gap between this and the Perjnian ; or, I would say, in a
broader sense, the latest part of the Palaeozoic time.
� I read Daintree?s paper with much interest, and think he has done much
to clear up some of the difficulties.
? But so long as some fancied analogies with regard to fossils are allowed to
sway the mind, there can be no agreement of opinion.
?The Glossopteris of Australia and India arc identical. We have every
variety, as described from your beds, and no one could hesitate to admit that
the beds are similar also. ?All these Glossopteris beds must be admitted to be
of similar relative age in both countries. It proves nothing as to the age
relating to European systems. Vou know better than I do the amount ol
co-existing evidence as to age which you have established in Australia.
? In India it is this, in a few words ;
(3.) Above ?A system of rocks, with abundance of Cycads, Tamiopteris,
Pecopteris, &c., &c., truly Oolitic with their threads of Coal.
(2.) Next, separated by considerable time beds with Schizoneura, Pccop-
teris (no Tamiopteris, no Glossopteris), Labyrinthodont, and Dicy-
nodont reptiles, the analogies of which are Permian or certainly
Lower Triassic (no Coal).
(1.) Next ?The Coal-rocks, also separated by unconformity, though
slight, which have abundance of Glossopteris and also of Schizoneura
of different species?as yet no animal remains.
? There are thus three distinct flora; with no species common to each. You
can draw your own conclusions. ?T. 0.?


In the above remarks ot my distinguished friend are some
hints that will not fail to be of use in relation to New South
Wales, as ivell as to other parts of Australia, and it is satis-
factory to myself to have so much confirmation of my own views.
Though it is true that Glossopteris, not being a European plant,
does not confer any claim on itself to designate the age of our
Coal beds, yet assuredly as it occurs in our Tower Carboniferous
beds as well as in the Tipper Coal Measures, it does bear on their
association with the greatest force, and the two series of beds
must be nearly of the same relative age. That age, as pointed
out by Dr. Oldham, and as I have all along stated, must be
Palaeozoic, either on a parallel with some part of the Upper
Palaeozoics of Europe or occupying a series of beds not repre-
sented there.
For the present I content myself with observing that Dr.
Ottokar Feistmantel, Palaeontologist to the Geological Survey of
India, reports the finding of Glossopteris since 1870 in the
Eajmahal beds, and that instead of the same species of Glossop-
teris occurring generally in New South Wales and India, in the
Damiida beds wliich are held to be conformable with those of
this Colony, he thinks ?with great difficulty we may be able to
get only one common species? (? Records , Geol. Sur. No. 4,?
1876, p. 122.) ?It seems,? he adds, ? that the existence of a
connection with the Australian is very weak.? *
Dr. Feistmantel (4th Nov., 1877) tells me that Glossopteris
occurs both in the Panchet and Talchir systems, so that its
species must have ? a very wide range,? going up from the
Australian Palaeozoic to the Cutch Middle Jurassic. Dr. Oldham
had before in 1800 stated as much. (See p. 210 of ?Trans.
Boy. Soc. Viet.? 1860.)
As to the Coal-beds with no Glossopteris, they will go with
rocks of a more recent date, and there can be no objection to
class them in the age of the Secondary fossils with wdiich they
are associated. Professor M'Coy himself admits?? That on
mere fragments of leaves or other most imperfect or ambiguous
material no generic nor even ordinal characteristics should be
founded.? (?Observations on Veyetahle Fossils of Auriferous
Drifts , hy Baron von JSlueller ,? 1874, p. 14.) But this argument
does not apply where fragments even of the same plant occur in
* I cannot help alluding in this place to a passage in my letter to Sir H.
Baikly, K. 0.8. (? Trans, lloy. Soc. Viet.? 1860), the publication of .which loci
to a criticism on the part of my opponent, which was not tempered hy the
suaviter in modo, though in contradiction ?fortiter? was conspicuous ; and
which is recalled to my recollection by Dr. Feistmantel?s words above, ? ?I
would not be surprised token the whole deposit of our Carboniferous 'series
shall be made known, if doubts should arise as to the confidence toith which
some persons speak as to the correlation of the Australian and Indian Coal-
beds.?


two series of beds. Resting on, or passing into each other
without a break, they would assuredly show that such beds are
intimately related. .
If the idea be abandoned (and there is no real authority jor it)
that Glossopteris is an Oolitic plant, and if it be admitted that a
fauna has more weight than a flora, and that it is most probable
that floral identity never existed during the same epoch at the
antipodes of the European Oolitic area, more reasonable Mill
appear the position assigned by me to the New South Wales
workable Coal-beds.
Is it more remarkable tliat plants lield to be ot Mesozoic
in Europe should be found at the Antipodes in a Palaeozoic for-
mation, than that usually considered Mesozoic mollusca should
be found in a similar formation? And the latter is not merely a
conjecture but a fact, attested by Palaeontologists of eminence.
Eor instance, Munster in 1841 found the three genera Ammonites ,
Ceratites, and Goniatites in one and the same bed belonging
to the St. Cassian rocks of Austria ; and now we have Dr.
Waagan, of the Geological Survey of India, proving to us
that the same three yenera have been found in the same bed
together on the Salt Range, in the society of Productae, Athyris,
and other well-known Carboniferous fossils, pointing out that
the Ammonites is there a Palaeozoic genus, which he places either
in the upper part of the Carboniferous, or as Dr. Oldham con-
siders our disputed Coal-beds may be, about the limits of the
Permian and Carboniferous formations.
I may also quote here Dr. Feistmantel?s words in illustration
of the mingling of fossils of distinctive formations : ?We have in
India the same?cases. The genus Hyperodapedon, which is yet
known in England only from Trias, occurs here in the so-called
Kota Maleri beds, which are not older than Upper Lias-, this
Hyperodapedon is associated with Ceratodus, also of the kind that
mostly occurs in Trias ; the genus Parasuchus, also a Triassic
genus, occurs in the same beds, and with all these Fepidotus (of
Liassic character) is associated; or what shall we say when we
find in exquisitely Carboniferous beds (in the Salt Range) a
Ceratites and Ammonites, together with Froductus costatus and
P. semireticulatus on one side, and on the other the typically
Carboniferous genus Bellerophon (in Europe and elsewhere) high
up in distinctly Triassic beds, together with numerous Ceratites??

# l)r. Feistmantel, the most patient and critical expounder of Indian Palaeo-
botany that wo have yet had, devotes considerable space to the exemplification
of similar interchanges in India and South Africa, not only between animal and
plant remains, but especially with plant-beds of different stages ( Records,
Wo. IY., 1876, p. 116), and in ? Records ? (No. 2, p. 29) gives an explanation
thus : ?In such cases we must only say, the flora of this or that locality (or


TV hilst discoveries such as this are being made from time to
time, what obstinate pertinacity is it to continue to maintain
that even the stereotyped determinations of paleontologists are
incapable of amendment. (Por Ur. Waagan?s description and
ligures, see ? Memoirs of the Geological Survey of India," vol. ix,
part 2, p. 351. See also Lyell?s ? Elements," 18G5, p. 436, and
? Student's Edition," 1871, p. 358.)
No where in New South W^ales has there yet been found in
association with the plant-beds any Marine fauna but one which
M?Coy and all other Paleontologists admit to be Paleozoic.
The opposition to Grlossopteris claiming its descent from
Paleozoic times arose from a misinterpretation of facts connected
with its appearance in strata from which Marine fossils that
prove the age are missing; and thus it got condemned to be
Oolitic only, because it is found in company with other plants of
whose pedigree no notice is taken. The manner in which such
association is sometimes used is anything but logical??A,? it
is said, belongs to ? B,? and ? B ? ?belongs to ? C,? and, there-
fore, ?C ? belongs to ? A.? ?D? is not found with ? C,? there-
fore, it belongs to neither ? A ? nor ? B.?
Moreover, unless it can be proved that every given plant found
in different parts of the world had the same instant of existence
in all, there must be always uncertainty as to when we may date
its epoch. There is also too often a neglect of the conditions
of the Strata in which fossils occur, when they are compared
with similar fossils in widely separated regions. We know that
Coal-plants did not grow in the sea, and if they are found bedded
among Marine strata it is clear that there we have a guide as to
the age, which is only guessed at elsewhere. It would be of use
to keep in mind what Oscar Praas teaches us in his
t� Comparison of the Jura Formations with those of Germany
and England: ? 1850, as given by Professor Rupert Jones
in Q.J.Gr.S. vii, ? Notices of Memoirs" pp. 42-83. We must,
however, take geology as we find it, till we can arrive at truer
conclusions and safer processes than we now possess. The
boundaries of the great divisions, Neozoic, Mesozoic, Palaeozoic
stratum) is of such an age, and was still growing on the coast when already a
younger fauna was living in the sea.? Does not the ease of Qlossopteris, &c.,
in Marine strata prove the same in reverse order ?or as contemporaneous
vMth the Marine Palteozoic fossils, and do not both arrangements show how
there may be continuous connections from one formation to another, through
survivors ?
this has now been verified: and, singularly, the number five represents
tlie groups (though not precisely the same) in which Glossopteris according
to both writers, Oldham and Feistmantel, occurs, the latter naming Cutch
(J �balpur) Group ; Eajmahal Group ; Panchet Group ; Damuda Series;
and lalchir Shales. (See Hughes; ? Karanpura Coal-field Mem. I.
Snr. vii. Pt. 3, pp. 12, 47, 48 ; 1871.) These I had noted as published.


mav yet have to be modified materially, and many changes may
yet take place before the geological millennium arrives when
fellow-workers will lay aside their prejudices, their animosities,
and their inconsistencies.
Calling formations by the names by which they are at present
known, we may, nevertheless, admitting possibilities and proba-
bilities of local as well as of general phenomena, go a little
further into the vexata quasiio of New South Wales Carbon-
iferous peculiarities.
If on other independent grounds the Upper Coal-beds of New
South Wales can be treated as Mesozoic, it must still be borne
in mind that Glossopteris and other associated plants belong also
to a lower group or portion of a continuous series of beds
which are strictly Carboniferous ; nor must it be overlooked, that
iu strata supposed to be missing between the two series, which if
present would be Permian (or a new formation of which there
is no evidence anywhere), the Glossopteris, &c., would in all
reasonable probability appear there in situ , for it is incredible
that in such a continuous succession, those plants would, as it
were, leap over the whole original mass of deposits between
Palaeozoic and Mesozoic without leaving any trace of the exist-
ence of the genus.
Now, Professor M'Coy in his ?Report on some Fossils from
Queensland? (14 Sept., 1861), mentioned Producfus calva and an
Aulosteqes or Strophalosia which Mr. A. C. Gregory found on
the east of the Mantuan Dowms in 1856, and which I submitted
to the Professor for examination in 1860, the year I received
them (as mentioned in the last Edition, p. 33), and these were
held to be Permian. But Mr. Etheridge considers (Q. J. G. S.
xxviii., p. 321) that the existence of the Permian requires con-
firmation ; nevertheless, a shell, possibly a Strophalosia , is men-
tioned as having been sent by me to the Daintree Collection,
and this also came from the neighbourhood of the Mantuan
Downs, in the Nogoa district. It may bo suggested, therefore,
that there may be an outci'op of Permian in that vicinity ;
and, if it be so, it ought also to be remembered that
Sir T. Mitchell (? Trop. Ausf.? 1848, p. 240) mentions the
occurrence of Glossopteris Prownii at the base of Mount Mudge,
and other evidences of the Coal-formation, with Coal but a lew-
miles from the Dowms. Daintree has mapped the area in question
as ? Older Coal Measures? (with Glossopteris, Spirifer, and Pro-
ductus'), in an outlying patch of the Comet and Isaacs Coal-fields
and the furthest western portion of that portion of that forma-
tion. This possible Permian outcrop would be on the Dividing
Ranges between eastern, northern, western, and southern
waters, and intermediate between the acknowledged ? Mesozoic ?
and the ? Metamorphic? regions of the map.


The object of the above references is to suggest, that Gloss-
opteris is a member of a possible Permian outcrop, which has
not been yet sufficiently searched for.
However, the force of my argument depends on tins ?that
it is unlikely that plants which occur in Carboniferous strata
and in Triassic and Liassic beds (of which more hereafter) should
he missing in Permian strata, could the hitter be discovered.
And this without prejudice to the fact that in other countries
Triassic beds are found to surmount the Palaeozoic without the
intervention of Permian. The latter was held in 1839-?4O by
Professor Dana to represent the age of the New South Wales
Coal-beds, and in his first publications on the subject up to 1849.
In the First Edition of his ? Manual of Geology" he recalled that
opinion (p. 444), stating ? that in view of all the facts, it appears
probable that the Coal-beds referred to, both in Asia and Aus-
tralia, represent the Triassic period,? Butin the Second Edition
of 1875, he says (p. 370) ; The Coal formation of Illawarra and
Hunter Eiver, Australia, is probably Permian, as stated by the
author in his notes on Australian Geology.? (? Geol. Rep.
Wilkes's Expl. Fxpd." 1849.) Thus he returned like a true man
to his ? first love.? But in the First Edition he added : ?In the
Australian beds there are heterocercal ganoids, and hence the
formation cannot be more recent than the Triassic,? (p. 444). He
thus rejected all Oolitic or Jurassic tendencies, and at the same
time intimated the existence of a ? Carboniferous? flora, saying:
?Rev. W. B. Clarke reports true Lepidodendra from the interior
of New South Wales ?from which it appears that the Carbon-
iferous flora is represented in Australia.? This conclusion he
also repeated in his Second Edition, in these words ; ?It exists also
and includes workable Coal-beds in China, India, and Australia;
but part of the formation in these latter regions may prove to be
Permian,? (p. 345). *
The occurrence of species in the position assigned to those
named above is acknowledged by geologists in other countries.
Mr. Lesquereux thus alludes to them in one of his able special
Reports, ? On the Fossil Plants of the Cretaceous and Tertiary
formations of Kanzas and Nebraska." [? Prelim. Rep. U. S. Geol.
Sur. of the Territories, conducted by P. V. Hayden, U. S. Ge01.,"
1870, p. 377.] , ? Since the first appearance of land vegetation
upon the surface of our earth, what we know of it by fossil
remains seems to indicate for our country a precedence in time
in the development of botanical types. Large trunks of
* An excellent illustration of the way in which the succession in one
country diverges from that in another, is given by Mons. de Saporta in a
review of the ? Carboniferous Flora of the Department of the Loire and the
Centre of France as described by Mons. Grand ?Eury, in ? Dull, de la Soc.

coniferous wood are already found in our Devonian Measures,
while analogous species are recorded as yet only in Ihe Carbon-
iferous Measures of England. Though the analogy of vegetation
between the flora of the Coal Measures of America and Europe is
evidently established by a number of identical genera and species,
we have, nevertheless, some types, like the Paleoxiris , which are
considered as characteristic of strata of the European Permian,
and which are found in one of our Coal Measures as far down as
the first Coal above the millstone grit. Even peculiar ferns of our
Upper Coal-strata have a typical analogy with species of the
Oolite of England. Our Trias, by the presence of numerous
cycadeae, touches the Jurassic of Europe. But it is especially from
our flora of the Lower Cretaceous that we have a vegetable
exposition peculiarly at variance with that of Europe at the
same epoch, and whose types so much resemble those of the
European Tertiary that the evidence of the age of the formation,
where the plants have been found, could not be admitted by
Palaeontologists until after irrefutable proofs of it had been
obtained.?
If such ? seeming discordance? is the case in America, why
should not the same view be taken of the relations of the
European and Australian Coal Measures ? There can be no
greater discordance between the relations of the latter than with
the examples quoted above, with the additional fact, that in
Australia the Upper Coal Measures offer no evidence of any un-
disputed Mesozoic animal species.
In another place (op. cit., p. 374) the same accomplished
author says : ? The Lower Permian has still for its land vegetation
many species of plants of the Coal Measures, but here the conifers
appear represent ed for the first time by their leaves and branches,
and are of a peculiar order. * * * * The Triassic which,
with us at least, touches by the character of its flora to the
Jurassic, has plants which, like Cycadece , rather indicate a warm
than a vaporous atmosphere. But for this and the following
formations, the Jurassic, the data furnished by fossil plants on
this continent are too scant to permit reliable conclusions.?
What appears to me to be a conclusive opinion has been offered
by Dr. Julius Haast, F.R.S., respecting the occurrence of Marine
and plant beds of the same age as ours in the Malvern Hill Dis-
trict, Canterbury, New Zealand, who says, in October, 1871
(?AZ. Geological Survey Reports on Geological Explorations during
1871-72 ?),that on the west side of Mount Potts, Upper Bangitata,
there are ? different species of Spirifera ; besides them there are
species of Productus, Murchisonia, Euomphalus, Nucula, Orthis,
and Orthoceras. Most of these shells, of which some broad-
winged Spirifers are very numerous, are, according to Professor
M?Coy, of Melbourne, identical with Australian fossils, and are of


Lower Carboniferous or Upper Devonian age.? ?Other beds,?
he adds, ? of equal importance occur in the Clent Hills, in which
I gathered a rich harvest of fossil ferns, mostly Pecopteris,
Taeuiopteris. and Camptopteris? (this, however, is not found in
New South Wales) ?which,according to Professor M?Coy, are of
Jurassic age identical with beds belonging to the New South
Wales Coal-fields ; and although I believe this Clent Hill series
to be somewhat younger than the Spirifera beds, I demurred to
this definition, owing to the fact that the position of the strata
and the character of the rocks of which they are composed have
quite a Palaeozoic facies.?
? Since then it has been shown, and as I think with conclusive
evidence, that both tossiliferous strata, the Spirifera and Pecop-
teris beds, occurring together in the New South Wales Coal-fields,
are of the same age, and alternate with each other. The occur-
rence of Taoniopteris, which hitherto has been considered only of
Secondary age,* seems to speak against a Palaeozoic origin ; how-
ever, I may point out that the same objection was made to the
Glossopteris in Australia,but which has by overwhelming evidence
been shown to be also of Palaeozoic age. Ido not think that the
fragment of a leaf, however distinct, can unsettle all that strati-
graphical geology has proved to be correct,? (p. 6-7.)
Some recent researches made by me, with a view to the con-
sideration of this question of age, render it far from improbable
that a series of beds has been swept off the Coal Measures by
denudation, in which Marine beds may have overlain the now
existing strata, just as in a lower horizon they do still at Stony
Creek, Anvil Creek, Mount Wiugen, and in other localities. The
facts that the present Coal-seams range in elevation along the
coast, from below the sea to between 200 and 300 feet only above
it, and that to the westward they reach an elevation of upwards of
3,000 feet, still preserving the same plants as below, and with an
equal almost horizontal level (except in cases where local derange-
ment has occurred from special elevating forces), and moreover,
that similar seams occur at various other elevations between those
mentioned, induce me to consider it possible that there has been
a sinking along the coast-line, allowing denudation to operate.
At present this hint may not be worth much, but hereafter
more may come out of it. I ought also to add that between the
Hawkesbury rocks and the Coal there is often a series of beds
belonging to the Coal Measures in which Marine Palaeozoic fossils
are stated to have been found.
* Schimper says (tome 1, p. 600), of the genus Taeuiopteris ?? Ces Fougeres
paraissent etre propres au terrain, houiller Superieur et au Permian,? i.e., they
are Palaeozoic. It is only recently that I have obtained not only species of the
subgcnera, but real Taeuiopteris from New South Wales, and it is respecting
such only that I have written in using the name, in relation to Palaeozoic
Carboniferous rocks.


In the sections published some years ago by Mr. J. Mackenzie
and myself, and in subsequent sections by the former, as given in
his Report to Government, it will be seen that the number and
thickness of the seams vary considerably in different localities.
The former circumstance may be accounted for by the fact that the
beds in the Coal Measures since troubled by upheavals, sinkings,
and denudation, were deposited over various older formations,
some here, some there, which occur at different levels, so that
some of the strata are missing in a few of the localities, and all
are seldom seen together. Thus the Coal-series at the height of
8,000 feet does not contain so many seams as nearer to the sea
level. And, perhaps, in describing them it would be preferable
to separate the deposits into various local basins or saucers ;
though the conditions of a true basin can only be exhibited on
the large scale.
It is at least certain, that in the Western Districts, though
many of the conditions of the Newcastle and Illawarra beds exist,
there are found certain fossils which are not found in the latter,
and which would lead to the presumption that, as we ascend in
height above the seavve find the introduction of genera gradually
approximating to a more recent epoch. Tor example, the upper
beds of the Lithgow Valley Coal Measures contain a fossil which
I first collected in 1868, and of which Mr. Wilkinson has lately
gathered some striking examples. These coniferous fossils con-
sist of stems and branches ending in Strobilites. Professor
Dana, to whom I sent specimens, informed me that he had never
seen such in N. S. Wales before. To me they appear not unlike
the Strobilites from the Gres higarre of Soulz-les-Bains, in the
Vosges, figured by Schimper and Mougeot (? Monographic des
Plantes Fossiles de la Chains des Vosges. ? Leipzig , 1814. lab. xvi,
p. 81.) Dr. Teistmantel considers them as belonging to
Echinostrobus.
In another direction, viz., on the Clarence River, there is a
patch of Coal Measures in which there are forms resembling that
of Voltzia, with abundance of fragments of a plant common in the
Mont d?Or Coal Measures of New Caledonia, together with plants
that have a Tseniopteroid character but are not Tamiopteris, as
is the case with many other localities. On the other hand, on
Bundanoon Creek, in the County ?of Camden, there is a
Dictyopteris.
As tar as some of these plants are concerned, it may be
admitted that they are in an unsatisfactory condition at present;
but the balance in favour of a ? Carboniferous? age for some of
the Glossopteris beds is, to my mind, conclusive.
The question, then, about the age of some of the Australian
Coal must be considered as settled ; and if, as in lllawarra, the
Coal-beds at the base mix with the Marine beds, or immediately


overlie them as they do in the Fin gal district of Tasmania, it
would appear that all these separate occurrences belong to one
thick series, in which Marine beds and fresh-water beds interpo-
late each other. But, assuredly, in that case, the arrangement
adopted must express the order as follows :
1. Upper Coal Measures.
2. Upper Marine Beds.
3. Lower Coal Measures.
4. Lower Marine Beds.
So far as I know, the latter rest frequently on a conglomerate,
which in Tasmania I found to contain undoubted Carboniferous
fossils.
Hydro-Carbonaceous Shales.
Since the Exhibition of 18G2, on which occasion, in a paper on
the Goal-fields, I noticed the occurrence of oil-bearing Cannel
Coal at the foot of Mount York, and at Colley Creek in the
Liverpool Ranges (not on eastern waters), the former has been
in great request for the purpose of producing illuminating oils ;
and the produce has been brought into the market. In the
former locality, and in Burragorang, 1 have made some researches
which have satisfied me that these can only belong to the Upper
Coal Measures. At Burragorang the blocks of Cannel are found
in an intermediate position, between the top of the Coal Measures
and the Upper Marine beds, which (if the overlying measures
themselves do not) certainly bear the very strongest resemblance
to a part of the Hunter River series. {See Map and Sections.)
In Illawarra, also, there are Shales which are above that
geological position, and which produce oil for illumination, but
are not of the peculiar character of the Cannel at Mount York,
which in a great degree resembles the Bog Head mineral of
Scotland, only it is more valuable. The character of this sub-
stance is such as to justify its being considered a species of
Bathvillite or Torbauite, in consequence of its colour and woody
condition.
It has unquestionably resulted from the local deposition of
some resinous wood, and passes generally into ordinary Coal,
many portions of the same bed in the Illawarra mines exhibiting
the unmistakable features of the latter and the impress of
fronds of Grlossopteris as plainly as they are shown on ordinary
Coal shale. This hydrocarbon varies somewhat in composition ;
and (as at Colley Creek) is frequently filled with quartzose
particles, showing that it was deposited in a shallow pool, to which
sand was drifted perhaps by the wind.
At Reedy Creek, now called Petrolia, there is a band of thin
and very elastic substance of this kind, separated from the
thicker bed below by a parting of white clay.


Varieties of this mineral occur in the Grose River, at Burra-
gorang, on the Colo, on Mount Victoria, and in one spot in
Tasmania behind Table Cape, on the southern shore of Bass's
Strait, as well as in other localities in other Colonies. Presuming
that the origin above suggested is correct, viz., the occasional
occurrence in the ancient deposits of trees of a peculiar resinous
constitution, there is no anomaly in finding in one spot a mere
patch amidst a Coal-seam (as is the case at Anvil Creek, 011 the
Hunter River), or thick-bedded masses of greater area as in the
Coal-seams of Mount York, or of American Creek in the Illawarra,
depending on the original amount of drift timber.
In the section presented by the escarpment on the left bank of
Cox?s River, below Pulpit Hill, at Megalong, there are two beds
in which this hydrocarbon exists.
Some time since specimens of this, together with others from
the Illawarra, were taken to America by Mr. Consul Hall, and
were subjected to examination by Professor Silliman. The result
was afterwards published in the ? American Journal of Science and
Art," under the name of Wollongongite, an accidental misnomer
(as I have elsewhere pointed out), inasmuch as I have Mr. Hall?s
written assurance that the specimens examined by Professor
Silliman did not come from the Illawarra, but from the western
sections at Megalong and Reedy Creek.
Professor Silliman shows that this material, as tested by him,
has an illuminating power very much greater than any other yet
known. It would be invaluable if it existed in sufficient quantity
to meet all demands upon it. As it is, there are two separate
oil-producing works (one on American Creek, the other in
Petrolia), which are now employed in making mineral oils of
reasonably good quality, though both inferior to the product
described by Professor Silliman.
It has been an object of inquiry whether Petroleum springs
exist in New South Wales. Such have been reported from the
Corong in South Australia, and from Taranaki in New Zealand,
and from Victoria. The former is, we learn, a mistake, being
probably at a point where certain animal substances have decom-
posed. In New South Wales there are also two localities, known
to me for many years, in which a nitrous 'product exudes ; and
there are two or three in Western Australia of the same kind,
numerous specimens of which I examined. Nothing of value has
as yet been found.
Supposing the truth of the conjecture respecting the formation
of Torbanite and its allies from chemical decomposition and
changes of resinous kinds of drift timber in the masses now trans-
formed to Coal, the occurrence of such a mineral is not necessarily
confined to Coal-beds of one epoch ; and thus we find Dr. Hector
reporting on the occurrence of a hydrocarbon in New Zealand,


from what he deems a'Secondary formation, intermediate in
volatile matter between those of Torbane Hill and Hew South
Wales, the latter having by far the greatest amount, with much
less ash than the former.
Fuller statements respecting the localities maybe found in my
paper ? On the Occurrence and Geological Position of Oil-hearing
Deposits in N.S.W.f Q.J.G.S. xxii., p. 439. The reader will
also find numerous local sections of the Coal-beds in various parts
of the same Colony in the ?Reports of the Department of Mines,?
by John Mackenzie, F.G.S., Examiner of Coal-fields, and C.
S. Wilkinson, F.G.S., Government Geologist (1875-6), and
especially in the work entitled ?il lines and Mineral Statistics ,?
1875, prepared for the Philadelphia Exhibition. Mr. Mackenzie
has also given sections from what the Victorian authorities call
the ? Carbonaceous ? rocks of their Colony.
� 5. Mesozoic or Secondary Formations.
It must not be supposed,from my strong advocacy of a Palaeozoic
age for the workable Coal of Hew South Wales, that I repudiate
the existence of the Secondary Formation in Australia; or that,
because I oppose an Oolitic or Jurassic age for our Coal-seams,
I consider that no Coal, however insignificant it may be, does
exist in Australia, or even in Hew South Wales, which is younger
than Palaeozoic. There is sufficient evidence in the preceding
pages to the contrary to do away with that idea, besides having
done my best to bring to light the great Mesozoic formations .of
Queensland (See various notes by myself in the ? Quarterly Jour-
naif and the valuable Memoirs of Mr. Daintree, F.G.S., and Mr.
Moore, F.G.S., xxvi., 226-261). Although I hold the opinion
expressed above, there are deposits of Coal of inferior value as
relates to extent of area, in Queensland, Victoria, Tasmania, and
Hew South AVales, from which the distinguishing typical plants
are excluded; and which, till the discovery of such, must remain,
taking into consideration also their stratigraphical position, of
more recent age than the rich deposits of the Illawarra, Hunter
River, Talbragar, &c. I can only say, that whether I have been
mistaken or not in any given case connected with the geological
epochs of Australasia, it is not from want of honest devotion to
the cause of truth, nor from a desire to hold my own without
reason against those who differ from me, that I have in so many
publications during more than thirty-eight years of earnest
inquiry, defended what I conscientiously believe.
The rule, I think, in such a case as that before us, should be
laid down, that plant remains by themselves prove very little as to
the uncompared age of any formation, but when associated with
Marine fossils, ichose aye is determinable, they must go with that


formation, of whatever age it may be; for although plants may he
swept into the ocean at any period of their existence, they could
not be bedded in the same masses of stone formed in the ocean
and amidst the Marine fossils, without belonging to the epoch of
the latter.
Such is the case in Australia with Glossopteris, and perhaps
some others ; hence I claim for that at least a Palaeozoic age.
And so with those described by Mr. Etheridge-and Mr. Moore
(in the Memoirs above cited) the Mesozoic Marine fossils prove
the plants to be of that epoch ; and when the same plants occur
in strata which can be referred to a Secondary formation, and in
such also as are Carboniferous, it may be readily granted that
they are common to the two. But in the case of Glossopteris
no indication is at present producible of its existence in the later
formations.
We may therefore refer certain deposits in Queensland, in
parts of New South Wales, or the Coal series of Victoria, to
Mesozoic (not Oolitic) times, without trenching on the Carbon-
iferous indications. Ido not profess to know?and I know no
one who is able to tell me ?why such arrangements exist (espe-
cially as Mr. Carruthers?s doctrine is true, for instance, that
Tamiopteris and Glossopteris are akin in structure) as place
plants very much alike in some respects in different epochs,
without confusion, when also the position of the strata is what is
called ? conformable.?
It is no logical argument to say that, because there may be
great deposits of Coal in China or America or Great Britain that
are not what arc called Carboniferous, therefore there ought to be
such, for example, in Victoria, when we all know that they have
not been yet found to exist there, or that the same citations
would bear out the assertion that the New South Wales work-
able seams are also Secondary ; nor can the adroit alteration of
the expression Oolitic into Mesozoic, prevent our considering that
the general term was adopted for the more specific one, because
those who used it so were aware that they had made some kind
of mistake, and did not like to own it.
Now, there are no known Oolitic Marine fossils in all New
South Wales ; and the Oolitic or Jurassic fossils are of such
extent and variety in all countries, wherever the regions in which
they occur have been explored, that to put the identity of such
formations on a few plants, that may after all have no strict claim
to decide in the cause, would appear to me a very questionable
proceeding.
If, for instance, the fishes found by me in the Gib Tunnel
Range, near Nattai, are of a ? Triassic or Permian? facies,
according to M?Coy, and are Permian according to Egerton and
Dana, why should the beds in which they occur be set down as


Oolitic or Jurassic, instead of ? Trias sic or Permian?? Sir P.
Egertou lias shown that, with Palseoniscus, occur other genera,
closely related to Pygopterus, Acrolepis, and Platysomus, all
either Upper Carboniferous or Permian genera in other parts of
the world.
Then again, why should the Urosthenes of Dana, from a
prominent part of the Newcastle local beds, be loft out of the
same category ?
The view then is, that all these beds, ranging in succession one
oyer the other, and being all as I believe of fresh water origin
(for the Hawkesbury rocks contain plants, but no animal remains
except fishes), have a common relationship, and yet with no
pretext for a Jurassic origin on the score of animal co-existences
ot that era. AVhen we consider that the fishes alluded to, in
connection with Coal and Coal-plants, occur at different altitudes,
and are all heterocercal Ganoids, we must conclude that there
have been physical disruptions, and that there are gaps in the
succession occasioned by following denudation, or that there
have been repetitions of strata now only partly traceable.
Uor instance, the fish beds are at Cockatoo Island 1G feet
below the sea ; at Sydney less than 100 feet above it; 100 feet
at Parramatta; 250 feet above it at Campbelltown; 780 feet
above at Redbank nearPicton; 1,100 feet on Razorback ; 2,360
feet at the Gib Tunnel; and 3,450 feet on the Blue Mountains ;
the lowest two stations and the highest being in the Hawkesbury
series, and the others in the Wianamatta beds above the Hawkes-
bury ; whilst at Newcastle, the Urosthenes was the deepest below
the sea, and the oldest in position.
As necessary to explain still further the succession of strata, I
introduce here some additional remarks on the Supra-Carboni-
ferous rocks in the province of New South Wales.
Hawkesbury Rocks. ?Over the uppermost workable Coal
Measures, which are of considerable thickness, is deposited a
series of beds of sandstone, shale, and conglomerate, oftentimes
concretionary in structure and very thick-bedded, varying iu
composition, with occasional false-bedding, deeply excavated,
and so forming deep ravines with lofty escarpments, ?to the
upper part of which series I have given the name of Hawkesbury
rocks, ovying to their great development along the course of the
river-basin of that name. These beds are not less in some places
than from 800 to 1,000 feet in thickness, containing patches of
shale, occasionally with fishes, with fragments of fronds and stems
of ferns, a few pebbles of porphyry, granite, mica, and other
quartziferous slates, and assume in surface outline the appearance
of granite, from the materials of which and associated old deposits
they must in part have been derived. On the summit of the


Blue Mountains, and along the Grose Biver, the thickness o� the
series is very much greater than near the sea. Patches of very
small area contain hits of Coal, carbonate of iron, and some-
times represent miniature Coal Measures.
Towards the base, hands of purple shales arc frequent, and
ferriferous veins, with specular iron, haematite, ilmenite, graphite,
and other minerals, sometimes occur.
In places, as about the ? Yellow rock? near the Upper W ollombi
River, in Bon Bullen, and above the deep excavation of the
Capertee amphitheatre, salt and alum are found in cavities
formed by decomposition; and in other places, as at Bundauoon
Creek in the Shoalhaven District, at Appiu, and on the Bullai
escarpment of the Illawarra, and at Pittwater, north of Sydney,
stalactites have been formed under similar circumstances.
There is an enormous mass of brown iron ore highly carbonised,
partly worked at Pitzroy, near Nattai, another on Brisbane Water,
and a. smaller, on the coast, a few miles north of Sydney, and
other similar patches in intermediate localities. These are in
part associated with specular iron, which occasionally lines the
joints of the sandstones close at hand with w'ell-formed crystals.
The uppermost beds of this formation, especially where they
become conglomerates, exhibit isolated summits imitating ruined
castles, and have thus been traced by me at intervals all along
the escarpments to the westward of Sydney, from the latitude of
the Clyde River to that of the Talbragar, and in certain localities
wdthin the longitudes of that line and the coast. In the deep
ravines of the Grose and Dargan?s Creek, the one eastward and
the other westward of the Darling Causew ay traversed by the
Western Railway Line, the slopes are studded by fantastic pillars
sculptured by denudation and decay into imitative architectural
forms. Similar forms cap the extension of the coast range to the
head of the Goulburn River. The tints are poikilitic, darkening
from exposure, and exhibiting imitations of landscapes sometimes
of striking character. The semi-crystalline fragments of quartz,
and the disposal of colours (suggesting the idea of the action of
gases removing the ferruginous tint in places) have caused me to
believe that some transmuting agency has affected largo areas of
the Hawkesbury rocks. The glistening of the crystalline quartz
particles reminds one of the same character observable in the mill-
stone grit of England. It is impossible to understand how consider-
able masses of the sandstones could have received such a present
structure without the metamorphism suggested; for the crystalline
facets are quite unabraded and belong to particles that have been
collected originally by water holding silica in solution. By washing
in acids the colouring matter of the particles may be entirely
removed, and then it is seen that they are imperfect crystals.


But the cementing matter is not always ferruginous ; afelspathic
cement holds them together with used mica evidently derivative,
and sometimes with graphite.
Another variation in character o� the Hawkesbury rocks is in
their cohesion. In 1850 I was Chairman of the Artesian Well
Board, and remember the difficulty we had in procuring tools
hard enough to pierce the quartzose sandstone at the gaol in
Sydney ; the boring after a small depth was abandoned ?one of
the workmen precipitating the conclusion by blocking the bore-
hole. But in parts of the Railway Lines, there have been instances,
as stated to me by the Engineer-in-Chief, when the largest blocks
have been shivered to atoms by a not very heavy fall over an
embankment.
I his group of Hawkesbury rocks has been by some persons
denominated ? Sydney Sandstone.? The designation was derived
from the early settlers, who had not gone far into the country ;
but it is a misnomer, for it neither represents the whole of the
series nor the whole of the material of the rocks, besides making
contusion with the ? Sydney Sandstone ? of the Cape Breton
Coal-held of British America. The latter has a clearer right,
perhaps, to the title of ? Carboniferous,? as it is of the age of
the very lowest of our Australian Coal Measures. Yet with its
Lepidodendra, &c., it has fishes of the one genus which occurs in
our Hawkesbury and Wianamatta beds, over our Upper Coal-
seams.
Wianamatta JBeds. ?The Hawkesbury rocks are succeeded by
another group or series of strata named by me from the Wiana-
matta, or South Creek, which runs longitudinally through the
basin which fills in the area between a surrounding enclosure of
the former series which must have been broken up in part and
denuded, either completely before or during the deposit of the
sandstones over-lying the Coal Measures. The deep ravines which
mark the Hawkesbury rocks give place to rounded smooth undu-
lating softer argillaceous strata, in the bottom of the creeks of
which and in the beds of the river Nepean or Hawkesbury and of
George s River are marks of old erosion in the harder rocks
below r the argillaceous shales. Pot-holes are very common in the
Hawkesbury beds under the Wianamatta strata where exposed
at the points of junction at some distance from the present
creeks and drainage channels. Such may be traced at Myrtle
Creek, near Picton, and on the Windsor Road near Parramatta.
Ihese certainly prove a partial or general erosion before the
whole series of the Wianamatta strata were laid down. The
nearest beds of the latter to the underlying Hawkesbury rocks,
are shales w r hich have occasionally filled in hollows previously
existing, or contributed patches forming considerable masses as
well as thin layers to the uppermost Hawkesbury rocks. In this


way fishes have been found at various levels in shale patches, as
on the Blue Mountains, at Parramatta, at Biloela (or Cockatoo)
Island, and other places near Sydney. The Wianamatta beds
are, however, not all shale, for there are fine sandstones more
compact and heavier than the Hawkesbury, calcareous sandstones
and ferruginous nodules, bearing fishes and small fresh-water
molluscs which remind one of the somewhat similar nodules of
Permian beds of Germany.
Could I have procured the remains of fishes that have been
reported to me from beds belowthe Upper Coal, and of the finding
of which there is pretty good evidence, we might have been able
to show that the same genera that we find ranging from the
Wianamatta down to the Coal Measures of Newcastle, all through
the Hawkesbury series, occur still lower.
A Palseoniscus, found since my discovery in 1860, was ex-
hibited by the Surveyor General (who gleaned after my harvest),
in the Exhibition of 1875 at Sydney; and a specimen of Cleithro-
lepis found in a Railway cutting on the Blue Mountains was
shown by Mr. T. Brown, to whom it had been given by the
finder after I had had it photographed. These formed part
of the collection exhibited by the Mining Department at Phila-
delphia.
There are in the Wianamatta Beds in places columnar and
pisolitic iron ore, abundance of fossilized wood, plant impressions,
and calcareous sandstones, which latter torm the highest levels
and summits of insulated hills that attain but moderate eleva-
tion (1100-1800 feet) in the centre or on the outskirts of
the basin, which latter is chiefly confined to the heart of the
County of Cumberland and part of Camden, of which Bulbun-
matta or Razor Back Range and Menangle Sugar Loaf are out-
lying relics of a once wider extended plateau. Eossil plants
abound in some of the shales and fine sandstones, and the whole
area is marked either by old trappean or more recent basaltic
rocks, which have produced some effects on the beds traversed
by them. Very small patches of Coal occur, but no seams nor
any of value have been met with. The old Diorite hill of
Waimalee, or Prospect, near Parramatta, must have existed Jong
before the infilling of this basin, as the Wianamatta plant-beds
on the flanks of the hill have evidently derived their matrix from
the Diorite, and have since been intruded into by what is prob-
ably Tertiary basalt. Eelspathic trap is common in the basin,
and may have been connected with this outburst of igneous
eruptions which probably formed many of the solitary hills of a
portion of the County of Camden.
Victorian Palaeontologists claim for that Colony the existence
of a Coal formation of the same age as the Wianamatta. and I
have myself long ago pointed out that certain beds at the Barra-


800 l Hills resemble very closely certain strata about Camden
in New South Wales. But if the latter are proved to be of
younger age than that which has been assumed for them, it is
not necessary to place the two series (so widely separate in
space) on the same actual horizon.
We have not recognized in New South Wales the Cycadeous
plants of Victoria, nor is there a perfect agi?cement in the
phytology of the Wianamatta and Victorian strata. In 1861 I
mentioned (? Recent Geological Discoveries , &c.,? p. 45) three of
M'Coy?s New South Wales Plants, Gleichenites odontopteroides
(called Pecopteris by Morris and Carruthers) ; Odontopteris
microphylla; and Pecopteris tenuifolia , as occurring in the Wiana-
matta beds. These are not reported from Victoria, whilst Spheno-
pteris alata (Prong.), Grandini of Goepp.and Schiinper, from New-
castle, belongs to the Old Carboniferous in Germany, and not to
any Mesozoic formation.
In the list given in ? Progress Report of Victoria, 1874,? Pro-
fessor M'Coy mentions 3 species of Gangamopferis , from his
Upper Carbonaceous beds; 2 Neuropteris, 1 Pecopteris, 3
Sphenopteris, 1 Tmniopteris, with 3 Zamites and 1 Phyllotheca
from the Lower Carbonaceous ; and only one animal form, Unio
Dacombii. The alleged abundance and value of Coal in these beds
have been proved to be a myth. There is, however, more Coal
therein than in the smaller area of the Wianamatta and Hawkes-
bury rocks; and probably that is the reason why the Professor
would place them below the former group of New South Wales.
But when we consider the great improbability that a series of
strata having a thickness of at least 5,000 feet could ever have
existed between the Hawkesbury and Wianamatta series, and
that not a trace remains anywhere in New South Wales of such
interpolation, ?that the fossil evidence is in opposition to it, ?
and that the areas are totally disproportionate,?it would appear
a mere caprice of fancy to hold such a notion as that hinted at.
It may be well to make a final remark respecting Mr. Brough
Smyth?s idea, that the Coal-beds of New South Wales lie on
? limestone," (?Progress Report," p. 26.) Had he visited them
himself he would have seen that limestone, as such, is rather a
rare rock in connection with the New South Wales deposits of
Coal, which clearly interpolates the Marine beds; but the latter
are more frequently conglomerates, or sandstones and grits.
The Upper Coal Measures rest frequently on granite and slates
as well as on other rocks. The limestones in the Carboniferous
rocks are rare, being few and of limited extent and far between.
The author just mentioned considers the relation of the ? Goal-
bearing" to ? Palaeozoic rocks" as ?obscure,? but it is not obscure
to those who have examined for themselves, nor more so than the
feeling which induces philosophers to keep out of sight and


ignore the evidence which contradicts their own preconceived
opinions. It will have been seen in the preceding remarks, that I
have myself suggested the possibility of some part of our Sedi-
mentary deposits having a relation to the Trias, and it is only
fair to state that Professor M?Coy, in his earlier writings, limited
the New South Wales deposits to the Oolite of Scarborough.
Afterwards the term ? Mesozoic? was introduced to define the
period ?which, of course, left all undefined from the base of the
Tertiaries to that of the Trias ; the limit of range allotted by him
for the Queensland Secondary Marine fossils and plants being
fi-om the ?lower part of the great Oolite? to ? the base of the
Trias? {?Annals," ix, No. 50, Feby., 18G2), placing all on one geo-
logical platform. He might, therefore, admit the 1 rias to repre-
sent the ? Mesozoic? instead of the Oolite, but he has stuck
firmly to the latter.
On the other hand, I presumed to think that the plant-beds in
the separate Colonies did not represent the Oolite ?and that for
reasons assigned I have ventured to believe that the Coal-beds
belong to some part of the Upper Palaeozoic, either represented
by visible examples elsewhere, or belonging to strata not yet
found elsewhere represented.
In working out my own conclusions, X had recourse to what
was reported by the Geological Survey of India ; and relying on
the data proclaimed, I held that the nearest ally to our Coal-beds
was the Damuda division of what is now known as the ? Gond-
wana series or system ?of Feistmantel, {?Records, No. 2, 187G,
page 28.) Dr. Oldham agreed with me, as has been seen ; but
Dr. Feistmantel having obtained or discovered the existence of
plants in beds not previously recognized by the Survey, e.g.
Olossopteris, ?and finding it not only in the Damuda, but in the
Talchir strata below', and also in ?all the intermediate strata,
through the Panchet up to the Eajmahal and Cutch (Dr. Old-
ham agreeing with him as to Panchet being Triassic), has come
to the following arrangement: ?
_ . ( Oolite f I.? Cutch or Kach with Jubalpur.
Jurassic | j^ ag | 2.?Kajmahal (in different places).
flveuper f 3.?Panchet (in different places).
| 4.?Damuda (do., including the Eani-
Trias ... J -{ ganj (Kamthi), Iron-Shale, and
1 Barakar groups).
( Gres Bigarre ( s.?Talchir.
These are the ? five horizons ? of the Gondwana system.
If this arrangement be correct, then it is clear that there is a
a Triassic series amidst the beds which M?Coy held to be alto-
gether Oolitic, but which I, in common with Dr. Oldham, con-
sidered in part Palaeozoic; and here I may quote Mr. W. T.


Stanford's able Report on tbe Eaniganj Coal-field. (? Memoirs
Geol. Sur. India," Vol. iii., part 7, ebap. vi., page 135, 1861),
in which the author writes in relation to the Panchet group ;
? So far as this evidence goes, it tends to confirm Sr. Oldham?s
suggestions as to the Damudas being Upper Palaeozoic. For
Labyrinthodont reptiles (and consequently the Panchets if
equivalent to the Mangalis) being Permian or Triassic, and the
Damudas being but little older, would be Upper Carboniferous
or Permian, or perhaps intermediate between Permian and
Triassic ; but the evidence is very slight.?
It is not strange that sixteen years continued exploration,
and a critical examination of the fossils, should lead to a modifi-
cation of views, and it would be held presumptuous in anyone
not on the spot to dogmatise to the contrary.
The present able Superintendent of the Geological Survey in
India, Mr. H. B. Medlicott, F.R.S., thus speaks of Dr. Feist-
mantel?s botanical researches : ?? Palieontologists come from
their cabinets in Europe with the fixed idea that the ? laws ? they
have seen to work so neatly as between Bohemia and Bavaria,
or from Durham to Dorsetshire, will apply equally well between
India and Australia, or Europe ; and the eager aim of their
labours seems to be to tally otf our Indian rock-groups as the
representatives or equivalents of certain fossiliferous series of
Europe or elsewhere. From the beginning this Palaeontological
fallacy has been a chief obstruction to our knowledge. When
first the Gondwana fossils were taken up, pure Geology being in
the ascendant, the fact that certain plant forms of the lower Gond-
wana rocks were somehow associated with beds having a Car-
boniferous Marine fauna in Australia, was made the basis of a
special pleading to show that the Damudas, their flora, and their
Coal, were Paleozoic. The materials have now come into the
hands of a pure palaeontologist. He has shown, I believe con-
clusively, that the Gondwana flora is wholly Mesozoic, nailing its
several phases to certain representative zones in Europe. But
it so happens that on the confines of India, east and west, the
upper Gondwana groups are associated with beds having a Marine
fauna according to which these said groups have already been
attached by palaeontological experts to other standard groups in
Europe. It is true that the study of this fauna was only partial;
but tbe experts were very accomplished in their line, and their
judgment was quite unprejudiced, so that it must carry great
weight. Here then again is an opening for the procrustean method
of research: and there are symptoms that it is to be duly applied ;
this time to make the fauna conform to the fora No theologian
could be more impious in reducing the mysteries of existence
to the compass of his narrow thoughts, than are often scientific
specialists in imposing crude conceptions upon the proceedings


of nature. Tet these ought to know better?that truth is dis-
covered, not invented.? ?It is fiction to assume that Palaeozoic and
Mesozoic faunas have not co-existed upon the earth.? ?The facts
of our Groudwana rocks are certainly puzzling to systematists:
on the West in Kach (Cutch) we have the flora of the top Gond-
wana group, which has a Bathonian facies, associated with
Marine fossils of Tithonian affinities; while on the the South-east,
in Trichinopoli, beds with a flora (so for as known) like that of
the Rajmahal group, which is taken to be Liassic, have been de-
cribed by Mr. H. P. Blanford (? Mem. Geol. Sur .,? vol. iv., p. 47)
as overlaid, in very close relation, by the Ootatoor group, the
fauna of which has been declared, upou very full evidence, to
have a Cenomanien facies.?
? These questions of homotaxis concern the whole body of
naturalists as much as they do us; and I hope some guiding
spirits amongst them will keep a watch on our proceedings.
Happily these foreign relations do not interfere with the local
regulation of our rock systems. The terrestrial fauna and flora
of the Gondwanas is developing into a compact unity of its own,
and its relations to contiguous Marine fossil faunas is normal, so
far as this word can be legitimately used.? (?Records Geol. Sur.
India," vol. x., pt. 1, 1877, pp. 2, 3.)
On this plan of dealing with the Australian and Indian Coal
formations in relation to their fossil vegetables, there must be a ne-
cessity for very close examination of the individual plants to satisfy
the inquiry; and relationship to the Marine fossils of the former
which do not exist in the latter cannot, ow the plea expressed by
Medlicott, be excluded. We may, therefore, look to Dr. Peist-
mantel?s comparison of the respective floras of the two countries.
In order to assist in this I had placed in the hands of my friend
Dr. Oldham, at Calcutta, a considerable series of our-New South
Wales plants, from Newcastle, Hunter River, Illawarra, Lith-
gow, Merigang, Clarence River, &c.,in New South Wales, and from
Queensland, Tasmania, and Victoria, including the Coal-seams of
this Colony and the overlying strata of the Hawkesbury and
Wianamatta groups. A few of these were contributed by Mr.
C. S. Wilkinson, and the collection was left in the hands of Dr.
Peistmantel when Dr. Oldham retired from the direction of the
Indian Survey.
On these, the latter gentleman has reported to me his opinion.
Since then, I forwarded at his desire a further collection, com-
prising additional specimens of plants from the lower Coal-
seams of the Hunter, collected in part by Mr. Mackenzie, from
Greta, Stroud, Queensland, &c., including the fishes of the Gib
Tunnel, with sections and papers, &c. These arrived safely, and
an account of them will be found in Appendix XX.


This is named to show that no pains have been spared by me
to put as full evidence before Ur. Feistmantel of the plants, as
I had already done respecting the Marine faunas of the Silurian,
Devonian, and Carboniferous beds.
Now, Dr. Feistmantel states that so far from the plants of
the Coal-seams being exactly the same as those of the Indian
Coal plant-beds, he thinks that?(? Pec. Geol. Sur. India," ix. r
pt. 4, 1876, p. 121)* ??those paleontologists who declared the
whole Australian flora as absolutely Jurassic [? or altogether
Mesozoic,? as interpolated in MS. by the author in author?s
presentation copy], did not distinguish the Lower and Upper
portion of the Coal Measures. The first contains forms which
could never support this assertion, while the Upper Measures-
contain, besides those plants without analogy, some other forms
which certainly can justify the supposition of a Jurassic age
[altered in MS. as above, to?? Triassic age, some perhaps also
Jurassic (Queensland) ?].
?On page 83, Mr. Blanford gave a scheme of the formations-
in N.S.W. Coal-fields (1,2, 3, 4, 5, G). Nos. 1 and 2 ( Wianamatta
and Hawkesbury beds), it is true, have yielded no distinct
Glossopteris ; but in Tasmania, from which identical fossils with
those of these two beds are known, Glossopteris occurs, with
Pecopteris Australis, Phyllotheca, and the most important with
Tceniopteris Daintreei (M?Coy), (M?Coy : ? Prodrom , Decade II."
p. 15, ?Pep. Prop. Geol. Sur. Viet., 1874, p. 25?). As to 3 and 4,.
of which the first are the Upper Coal Measures of Newcastle,
Mr. Blanford himself (p. 83) says: ? Nos. 3 and 4 appear to-
be connected by the presence of Glossopteris Browniana in both,
although there appears to he a considerable distinction in the
flora"; and I would add, No. 3 does not contain any animals,,
while in No. 4 Marine animals are found abundantly.
?On p. 84, Mr. B. enumerates the species, which, as he-
considers, are common to our Damiidas and the Australian
beds, and others which are common to the Damudas, and the-
Triassic rocks in Europe (as I pointed out). On these I would
remark, ?
? Glossopteris [?2 or 3 species identical. ?W.T.B.?] I think
with great difficulty we may be able to get only one-
common species.
# On the question ?What is the analogy of our Damiida Scries with the-
Loiver Coal Measures of Australia? After saying that the analogy is by
no means what Mr. Blanford seems to think, he proceeds, ??Any instructive
or conclusive comparison [?of our Damudas? in MS.] can only be made between
[?with? in MS.] series that possess fairly represented and characteristic flora_
For our Damudas this condition can only be said to exist in the Upper Coal
Measures in Australia, and in some exclusivel j plant-bearing rocks of Europe.?* 1


? Ganyamopferis [? The genus only. ?W.T.B.?] This form is
not known at all from those beds intercalated with Marine
fossils, hut from really Mesozoic beds in "Victqria,
associated with Tceniopteris Daintreei, M?Coy.
? Yertehrarin [? One species identical W.T.B.?] There is as
yet no full description of the Australian Vertebraria, and
that which is known seems to be quite different from
ours. The greatest portion of our Damuda Vertebraria
are probably not identical with those from Australia.
?Pecopteris (Alethopteris) [?One species,probably identical,
W.T.B.?] I doubt whether our A. Lindleyana can be
united with A. Australis, M?Coy, or if this is altogether
the case with any other species.
? Thus it seems that the evidence of a connection with the
Australian Coal Measures is very weak, while the fossils enumer-
ated as common with European Trias arc unmistakably identical.
?As to the strntiyrophy of the Australian Coal strata, the litera-
ture is not poor, but yet it is not in all points quite clear and
always trustworthy.
? It is well known that there can be a complete concordance
in the stratification of rocks, and yet two or more different
formations may be represented which can only be distinguished
by the prevailing fossil forms.* As an instance I can quote the
Salt Range in India, where, as Mr. Wynne tells us, the Lower
Marine Carboniferous and the Triassic rocks are conformably
deposited, and yet they are different in age, although a well-
marked Ceratites and Fhyllotheca go down into the Carboni-
ferous rocks, and marked forms of JBellerophon survived into the
Trias. The same relations will have to be applied to the two
portions of the Australian Coal Measures, only that hero the caso
is illustrated in the flora.
? Lor the stratigraphical grouping of the Coal-strata of New
South Vi ales, we must especially take the Rev. W. B. Clarke?s
observations, which to a great extent are published (? Remarks,.
Sfc.f 1875); partly Mr. Clarke communicated them to me in two-
letters ; and he sent also a suite of fossils for comparison. From
all his clear communications it is plain that there are two very
distinct portions in the Australian Coal Measures :
? a.?Upper Goal Measures.
? I). ?Lower Coal Measures.
? a. ?The Upper portion is marked by a flora which is
abundant. Nos. 1, 2, 3of Mr. B?s list must be referred
to this ; they contain no Marine fossils to indicate a
connection with the lower portion.
# See a very remarkable instance of this referred to by me, at p. 31, of
the position of the Pahcozoic formations at a locality in Spain, described by
Casiauo de Prado.?W.B.C.


? b. ?The Lower Coal Measures are marked by two Marine
faunas of, as generally taken, a Carboniferous age, which
separate distinctly these from the Upper beds. The
flora is, as both Mr. Clarke and Mr. Daintree state, only
rare.
u c Below this there are beds with real Lower Carboniferous
plants.?
Dr. Feistmantel then gives the succession of the several strata
as I had communicated it to him in a table, and after it a list of
plants which he ? has seen, or which are mentioned as really
occurring,? viz. :
?a. ? Upper Coal Measures.
? (1.) From Queensland.
(2.) Tasmania.
? (3.) Victoria.
? (4.) From the Wianamatta and Hawkesbury, we have
mostly JDichopteris, Thinnfeldia, Pecopteris odontopter-
oides, Morr., Toeniopteris , &c.; and in both the same
genus of a fish.
? (5.) From the Clarence Fiver District. ? Toeniopteris with
narrow leaves, and a coniferous branch, which Mr.
Clarke himself marked (?) Volfzia.
? (G.) Bowenfells and Newcastle.?Here the flora is mostly
developed ; Yertehraria, real Plnjllotheca , many Glossop-
teris (but few identical with those of India), mostly
Gloss. Browniana , Bgt., coniferous plants near the
Mesozoic Echinostrobus , coniferous seed-vessels and
others, but no animal fossils, nor Lower Carboniferous
plants.
? b.?Loiver Coal Measures.
? I have seen Toeniopteris, near Teen. Eckardi, Germ., Gloss-
optcris, small specimens ; besides these there are quoted Phyllo-
theca and Noec/geratlna. With these arc associated Carboniferous
(in M.S. ? animal ?) fossils.
?c.? Strata below ?With Cyclostigma Kiltorkanuni, Haught.,
Phacopteris, Sphenophylhim (real Palaeozoic form).
These I have seen myself. And again a Paheozoic
(Carboniferous) fauna.
?From this we see the following: Only the strata sub b can
claim a Paleozoic age, containing a prevailingly Carboniferous
fauna, which already in c occurs together with a palaeozoic flora.
The flora in b is very poor, containing only few forms, which (see
remarks p. IGS) are so frequent in the upper strata ; and to use
Air. Clarke?s own words about the Glossopteris, we may say, ?
? There (in the Australian Lower Coal-beds) it clearly does not


govern, but must be subordinate to the fauna?; and further he
says, ? Why might it ( Glossopteris ) not pass into Secondary rocks
without denying its existence in the Australian Lower Coal-
measures? P? [ln MS. he adds, ? What I completely adopt.?]
At p. 125, he says ??That the Upper beds in Australia?
Wianamatta, Hawkesbury ?and the Upper Newcastle Coal-beds
form a connected series, is also shown by the occurrence of the
same fish, which is not found in the Lower strata.

ne when Car

eris began to live rarely in Australia ,
Carboniferous animals lived in the sea?in
the time of the lower Australian beds. They are, therefore, of
Carboniferous age. But Glossopteris continued to live when
ali?eady the Lower beds were deposited (including the Marine
animals), or when the Marine animals ceased to live ?when
therefore, in fact, another epoch of life began which was charac-
terised by the total absence of Marine Carboniferous animals
and by the preponderance of plants ; and I think in this lies the
difference between your Tipper and Lower Coal-beds, of which only
the latter can be considered of Marine origin, as Marine beds,
while the Upper ones are certainly not Marine beds. And from
this reason, I thought, only those Tipper Coal strata in your
country can be compared with our Talchir-Daunida beds, as these
do not contain any Marine fossil at all, and the flora they contain#
bears a complete Triassic facies, so that I do not see any reason
why these beds should not represent the Triassic epoch; as
for another epoch there is not the least indication. And now,
judging from this, I was also convinced that your Upper beds
cannot be Oolitic, or even Liassic (except, perhaps, some in
Queensland), as they are equivalent to our Daimida series.?
(MS., letter 20/2/77).


Dr. Feistmantel lias since favoured me with, several letters,
which relate to a fuller expression of our Australian formations,
to which I cannot do full justice in my limited space. I must,
however, quote a passage from some remarks of my own, during
my discussion with Professor M?Coy, which were read before the
Eoyal Society of Victoria, December 10, 1860, in order to show
that any proposal to give a more recent age than that I defended
to our N. S. Wales Coal-seams does not take me by surprise:
?To sum up all, I may here state that though it is very easy to
make the ? worse appear the better reason,? I have no object in
any controversy on this question but truth. Having since my
acquaintance with the whole of the facts always found a diffi-
culty in reconciling the idea of two epochs in the formation of
the deposits including our Coal-beds, in consequence of the
apparent continuous succession of those deposits and the occur-
rence of Coal throughout, together with the absence of Oolitic
zoological and thepresence of Palaeozoic zoological forms,! have not
seen fit to renounce the opinion which is shared by others as well
by myself, because at present we have no grounds to do so. But
it is easy to gather from this paper, as well as from other
evidence of my own, that I am quite ready to admit, when
proved, that some of the beds are younger than my fourth
division, or Mr. M?Coy?s base of the Carboniferous system, and
may with the example of India before us be even younger than
Oolite ; but with the idea of one succession, I must renounce the
idea of all above the base being Oolitic.?
Future researches may be needed to ascertain?what is possible
?that true Palaeozoic Marine fossils may be yet detected, in some
at present obscure localities, above the horizon of the Upper Coal-
seams of New South Wales ?or below the base of the present
Talchir of India ; and in either case there would be a probability
of reversing a decision respecting the claim of the lowest Meso-
zoic, a contingency which would not take even Dr. Feistmantel
by surprise, as he suggested to me (August, 1877) : ? The Indian
Damuda series you may be pretty certain must turn out Trias,
or at the utmost Uppermost Permian as passage bed between this
formation and the Trias, but there is nothing as yet which would
prove for this, while all is in favour of Trias.? We must bear in
mind, however, a suggession of Mr. Carruthers, that the Permian
vegetation shows Mesozoic affinities, and that in fact the com-
mencement of the Mesozoic flora is to be sought in the Permian.
(Q. J. G. S., xxv, p. 158.)
The above references under the head of Mesozoic, though
alluding to the Carboniferous, are rightly introduced ?but not
with the intention of accepting the former age as comprehending
the latter till further proof has been afforded.


The differences between the conditions of the Damuda Coal-
beds of India and the Coal-beds of New South Wales are by the
allowance of Dr. Feistmantel sufficiently striking to justify delay
until further evidences have been produced for their union or
identity. At one time I held the opinion that the Damiida was
our nearest ally in the defence of a Carboniferous age, but as
that has now to be regarded in a different light, the differences
alluded to must be taken to imply somewhat different positions
for the two formations. For the absence of Marine fossils in
India, and the dissimilarity of botanical species among the plants,
with some other particulars, leave a margin for the adoption of a
provisional later date for the one than for the other.
But I say this without prejudice, and though I had. once on
this subject to dip in the ink of controversy, I am willing
to accept with thankfulness the valuable instruction derived from
the able critical examination of the plants that has thrown so
much light on the comparative fossil vegetation of India and
Australia, and this too in continuation of what long ago I believed
to exist, the presence in the latter of true Triassic as well as
Jurassic strata.*
Queensland and Western Australia. ?Mr. Charles Moore (of
Bath), F.G-.5., enumerates 171 species of Secondary animal fossils
from Queensland, all sent to him for description by myself ; and
sixty-two from Western Australia, of which twenty species are
common to England and that Colony. (See Q. J. Gr. S, xxvi, 261.)
(See Appendix ATiAT.)
In Mr. Dalrymple?s ? Report of his Exploration on the North-
east Coast of Queensland ,? {Brisbane, 1873, p. 20.), that enter-
prising observer states that the flat-topped ranges and mountains
* It will be seen from the following extract of a communication made by
me to M. le Yicomte d?Archiac, 14 Nov., 1859, and which was published in the
? Bull. Geol. Soc. France,? that I held opinions expressed as at the present
respecting the position of Olossopteris in India mentioned by Dr. Oldham :
? D?ou I?on pent inferer au moins que ce genre ne caracterise pas seulement
Jurassique. II peut s?etendre au-dessous aussi bien qu? au-dessus, et,
prenant ces iaits en consideration, on ne peut pas y voir un motif oppose a ce

relation to India.


about the Endeavour River have ? red sandstone escarpments,?
a feature that assimilates the formation somewhat to the ? New
Red ? or Triassic.
The latter collection belongs chiefly to the Lower Oolites,
Tipper and Middle Lias; and the former embraces the Upper
Oolites and Cretaceous formations. Mr. Brown, Government
Geologist in Western Australia {?Report of 1873 ?), mentions
Mesozoic beds in the Darling Eange, and again on the South
Coast, from Cape Rich to beyond Mount Barren and as far as
Ua,pe Esperance. Saliferous and reddish sandstones, &c., are the
chief rocks. On his chart they and their detritus occupy seven
degrees of and from one to three of longitude. But
there is nothing defined as to fossiliferous evidence, except about
Champion Bay. From Wizard Peak and Mount Fairfax I have
received numerous fossils through the agency and kindness of
the Hon. F. P. Barlee, F.R.G.S., Colonial Secretary, and the
Rev. C. G. Nicholay, of Geraldton, who not only added to my
collection, but supplied me with a personal survey of his
neighbourhood on an enlarged scale, and with more minute
details than Mr. Brown?s chart exhibits. (See Q. J. G. S., xxiii, 7.)
South Australia and Tasmania. ?There does not appear to be
any fossiliferous evidence of Mesozoic formations in South Aus-
tralia, where the rocks are chiefly Palamzoic, Metamorphic or
transmuted, and Tertiary.
In Tasmania, there is, no doubt, about the same evidence as
for New South Wales. Victorian geologists believe that the
Coal of Jerusalem is Secondary. I was inclined to think that
the neighbourhood of Green Ponds and Bagdad betrays a
resemblance to some portions of the Wianamatta shales and
sandstones of New South Wales. But the area there is far from
extensive.
Mr. Gould, who surveyed considerable portions of the Colony,
says nothing leading to the idea of any extensive Secondary
areas; and whatever hold they may have on the mind of a
geologist who has not carefully observed, must be due to pre-
conceived notions as to the age of the Coal, some of which has
of late established its Palaeozoic character as unmistakeably as
the seams of Anvil Creek, &c.
Coal has been reached on the Mersey under the Marine
fossiliferous beds, as I always held it would be, in spite of
vaticinations to the contrary.
New' Caledonia. ?Passing over to New Caledonia, the Secondary
formations are represented by Triassic, Liassic, and Neocomian
rocks or fossils.
On the Gfch July, 18G3, a paper by M. Eugene Deslongchamps
was read before the Linnean Society of Normandy, on the
Geology of Ilugon Island, New Caledonia, in which mention


is made of a Pecten and fish scale from Cape St. Vincent, on the
S. S. AV. Coast, collected by M. E. Deplanches. Millions of an
Avicula (. Monotis ) allied to M. salinaria of Goldfuss, of which
M. Eichmondiana, of Zittel, is a variety, also occur. Astarte,
Turbo Jouani, and one other ; Spirifera Caledonica ; S. Planchesi
Scyphia armata ?all these are Upper Triassic.
M. Garnier?s fossils, examined by M. Fischer, were pronounced
to be Monotis ; Halobia (an Austrian species) ; and Mytilus
prohlematicus of the same formation.
The supposed Jurassic rocks contain Nucula nearN. Hammeri
(De fr.), a Littorina, a Cardium, and an Astarte resembling A.
Voltzii (Goldf.) M. Fischer believes, however, that these are
more likely to be Triassic also.
M. Munier-Chalmas names also as Jurassic Ostrea suhlamel-
losa ; Astarte (or Tfeniodon) precursor ; Pellatia Garnieri ? and
Cardium Caledonicum.
A large Pinna seems to represent the Cretaceous rocks. A
tolerably full account of the Geology of New Caledonia will be
found in my u Address to the E. Soc. NS.TV., 1875?; see also
? Note sur les Ecches, fyc.,? just published at Noumea, by M. Eatte.
New Zealand. ?New Zealand exhibits abundance of proofs
that Secondary formations exist there, and not the least remark-
able fact is, that Professor Hochstetter in 1859 discovered there
the same Avicula Eichmondiana as above, and Halobia Lomelli,
Avicula salinaria, with Monotis, Spirigera, Spirifera, &c., belong-
ing to the Triassic epoch.
In my paper ? On Eecent Geological Discoveries,''? I collected
as much of this kind of information as I then could ; but since
then the skill and labour of the Geological Survey of New
Zealand, under the direction of Dr. Hector, have produced an
abundant harvest of scientific details ; and to the able publi-
cations and reports from that authority I may refer those who are
interested in the development of that most interesting group of
islands. They will find there ample evidence as to the existence
of Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous, as well as of Palaeozoic
rocks. The Saurian discoveries of Mr. T. Hood Cockburn Hood,
F.G.S. (see Q. J. G. S. xxvi, 1870, p. 409), also deserve com-
memoration ; nor must the labours and great discoveries of Dr.
Haast, F.E.S., be unremembered.
So far as the Trias is concerned, Hochstetter?s discoveries of
the genera and species about Eichmond have been rivalled by
Captain Hutton, in Southland, Otago, who found in 1872, on the
Moonlight Eange, Monotis Eichmondiana (Zitt.), and Halobia
Lomelli (AVissm.) On the western slope of Hokanuis, and on
the south side of the AVhiraka Hills, he obtained the same
species, with others, proving that the rocks are the same as the


sandstones of Richmond, near Nelson, andalso provingthe Triassic
age of the deposits. (? Geology of Southland. Report of Explora-
tions, Oeol. Surv. N.Z.," p. 104.)
Not very distant the same careful observer detected some of
the same species as occur in Queensland in the Middle Jurassic
formation, described by Mr. Moore, e.g., Astarte Wollumbillaensis ,
with other genera and species that link in the South with
the North Island (p. 105). These discoveries justify the
inference that Triassic rocks are probably present also in New
South Wales.
New Guinea. ?It has long been known that Jurassic rocks
exist at the northern end of New Guinea. But recently Signor
d?Albertis brought to Sydney from the Fly River several fossils,
among which Professor Liversidge noticed Belemnites and an
Ammonite (of Liassic facies), &c. These I also saw ?but I did
not recognize those species which I have from Queensland.
Cretaceous.
When I first announced in 1860 the proof that Secondary
fossils did exist in Australia, exhibited in Sydney, and
forwarded to Sir Henry Barkly for Professor M?Coy?s inspection,
I especially mentioned the occurrence of Cretaceous species.*
This was doubted, and the whole series classified as ? not higher ?
than the ? lower part of the great Oolite." But in 1860, the
Professor himself announced from another part of Queensland
the occurrence of two Inocerami, and two Ammonites, from the
Flinders River district. He also announced an Icthyosaurus, a
Plesiosaurus, and a Belemnitella, from lower Cretaceous strata of
the same district.
Mr. Moore says, of the Wollumbilla fossils, ? That they all
belong to the Tipper Oolite may with safety be inferred, but the
Cretaceous beds have a claim to be considered,? and he established
the existence of the genus Crioceras, which was first reported
by me.
In 1872, Mr. Daintree, F.G.S., read his Notes on Queensland,
before the Geological Society, the Marine fossils illustrating
which were (as before stated) described by Mr. Etheridge, F.R.S.,
L. &E.,F.G.5., Palaeontologist to the Geological Survey of Great
Britain. The number of Oolitic species recorded is six, and of
Cretaceous twenty-five.
The expedition of 1872, in the Cape York Peninsula, in which
Mr. Norman Taylor, of the Victorian Survey, was Geologist, has
* See papers by the author ? On Recent Geol. Discoveries in Australasia
(1861) pp. 27, 48, and ? On Marine Fossiliferous Secondary Formations in
Australia ? (Q. J. Gr. S., xsiii, 8.)


added to the list of Secondary fossils in Queensland. These were
sent to me for inspection by the Minister for Public Works in
that Colony, and at his request forwarded to the Agent General
in London. They have not yet been fully described.
A still further amount of Cretaceous fossils, forwarded by Mr.
Hann, the leader of the Expedition of 1872, to Mr. Etheridge,
and a large collection in my own cabinet, remain yet to be deter-
mined.
This is sufficient' to show the extent of Mesozoic formations
developed since 1860.
Mr. Daintree reckons the areas of the Cretaceous and Oolitic
formations in Queensland at 200,000 square miles ; the Carbon-
aceous (Mesozoic) at 10,000, and the Palaeozoic Carboniferous
at 14,000, whilst the Devonian and Upper Silurian occupy 40,000.
The two younger, therefore, are nearly four times as extensive
as the older.
After the ? Norman Taylor? collection had gone to England, I
received three or four specimens from the Table Mountain,
between Hann?s Camps 41 and 42 Expedition Report ),
and forwarded them to the Queensland Agent General in London
for inspection by Palaeontologists at Home. Mr. Etheridge, the
Palaeontologist of the Survey of Great Britain, considers the
fossils in that conglomerate rock to be a species of Hinnites
like H. velatus and an Ostreet like O. Sowerhyi and that they
belong to the Oolitic series. The same conglomerate, as I learn
by a more recent arrival, occurs on the high ranges between the
Palmer and Cooktown, under the deposit which Mr. Daintree
calls Desert sandstone. It is a coarse rock containing broken
shells in a sandstone full of partly rounded pebbles. Mr.
Etheridge also considers the Walsh Elver series to be of Lower
Cretaceous forms. Some specimens of plants supposed, to be
Glossopteris were also forwarded by me to Europe, with the
shelly rock. Mr. Carruthers?s determination is, that they were
not of that genus, but rather a form of Taeniopteris nearly allied
to Stangerites ensis (Oldham and Morris in the Indian Survey
Memoirs), which Schimper calls Angiopteridensis. Another
specimen which I did not see in the great collection, but of which
I had a drawing from Mr. Taylor, was considered by several
geologists in Queensland, &c., to be Orthoceras, and, therefore,
Palaeozoic. Mr. Daintree says there were several specimens like
Orthoceras ; and so I think the one in question was, but I con-
sidered at the time that there was no Orthoceras present in the
box, but a good many Belemnites, and I considered the sketch
referred to was of the same genus.
I have since received the following statement ? There was no
specimen of Orthoceras in the entire series.?


I have also received a list of the genera of Walsh River fossils,
in Mr. Etheridge?s handwriting. It is as follows, making all of
them Lower Cretaceous :
Ammonites, allied to A. Ghj- Panopfea.
peiformis. Inoceramus.
Ammonites sp. Hinnites or Avicula.
Crioceri. Cytherea.
Belemnites. Cyprina.
Myacites. Myoconcha.
Byssoarca. Pecten.
Solemya or Iridina. Teredo or Teredina, in fossil
Area. wood.
An opinion has been adopted that the Mesozoic fossils from
Queensland, both those described by Mr. Moore and these by
Mr. Etheridge, were in mere drifted nodules. Mr. Taylor assures
me that such is not the case with the latter, and I long ago gave
a section of the beds at Wollumbilla, proving, as in the York
Peninsula, that the nodular masses were derived from a soft
shale, being in fact concretions. If they have been drifted they
have not travelled far.
Mr. Taylor ( ITann s Report,? p. 13) seems to have found the
shelly deposit before mentioned on ? a flat-topped Carboniferous
range? (on 9 Sept., 1872) ; and by a report of April, 1875, from
Cook Town, it appears that a fine seam of bituminous Coal has
been discovered at the junction of Oaky Creek and the Endea-
vour River, 20 miles from Cook Town ;?but from the determina-
tion of Mr. Carruthers, this Coal (confirming, however, Mr.
Taylor s statement) is not of the G-lossopteris age. The Coal of
the latter series is not known to extend further north than
20� 35' south.
In 1877 Professor Liversidge received from the Rev. Gr. Brown
from New Britain and New Ireland (lat. 48� S. and long. 150� E )
some grotesque figures ? cut by the natives out of a ?soft white
pulverulent material,? said to be thrown up by earthquake
waves, and ? having the appearance of plaster of Paris.? It
holds numerous remains of Foraminifene.
The account of it is given in an interesting paper read before
Soc - New South Wales > an d published in their Journal
1877, vol. xi, pp. 85-91, ? On the Occurrence of Chalk in the New
Britain Group ? An analysis is given in comparison with Eng-
lish chalk, which it certainly resembles ; but a doubt may be ex-
pressed as to its being true chalk. Something like it, but less
cretaceous, has been found in New Zealand, and I have found
white calcareous fragments in the drifts of N. S. Wales re-
sembling it. Professor Liversidge adds, that no true chalk has


yet been found in Queensland or New Guinea, and I doubt
whether it is older than Tertiary, probably such as the white
beds of the Australian Bight or of Aldinga.
Mr. Brady, F. 8.5., states that the Foraminiferse are nearly all
South Atlantic deep-sea species ; there were other fossils also
found during the ? Challenger? Expedition.
� G. Tertiary Bocks.
Kainozoic of Duncan.
Throughout the whole of Eastern Australia, including New
South Wales and Queensland, no Tertiary Marine deposits have
been discovered. There are, however, in various places of New
South Wales patches of plant deposits which, according to the
frequent notices of geologists, may be referred to some period of
the Tertiary epoch. A silicified sandstone or quartzite of this
kind, full of impressions of ferns and leaves of trees, but not
known to be now living, occurs at Jerrawa Creek not far from
Yass. It is probably Miocene. On the summit of the Cor-
dillera, near Nundle, about the Peel Biver Diggings, occurs a
ferruginous bed full of leaves. On the Bichmond Biver occurs
a white magnesite, full of yellowish impressions of leaves. At
Kewong, in the county of Gowan, there is a bluish deposit of
fine aluminous matter with black impressions. From a depth of
60 feet in a shaft near Bungonia, a pale yellowish white deposit
with similar impressions was brought up ; and on the summit of
a ? made? hill, above Kiandra Gold Field, at a height of 4,000
feet above the sea, and in a region now partly covered with snow
many months in the year, there is a deposit of black clay with
such casts of leaves as occur in similar clay near Hyde in New
Zealand.
In recent visits to various gold-fields in the Western districts,
I have found plant-beds of somewhat similar kind either cut by
the shafts or distributed in the wash-dirt below the alluvial
deposits, underlying in some cases thick masses of basalt. Such
occur at Gulgong; at Cargo; under Bald Hill at Hill End;
and also at Blayney.
At Lucknoiv also occur deposits of branches and fragments of
trees under the basalt, and on the Uralla Gold-field, and at
Home Buie, on Cooyal Creek, lignite and woody matter of a
similar kind were seen by me in the lowest deposit of the deepest
shaft.
No botanist is willing to declare what is the exact age of such
deposits ; but some of the leaves are supposed to represent,
among others, the foliage of Fayus; yet it was only in 1866 that
a beech forest was discovered, by the Director of the Botanical


Gardens, growing on the Macleay Elver. On comparing the
living leaves with the impressions in the various deposits men-
tioned, I can see no specific identity. This want of identity
indicates, that however the plant may resemble living plants they
cannot be of a recent period ; and yet there are occasionally such
close resemblances as to lead some good botanists to infer a
recent period for some of them. These and some other Tertiary
plants have been sent on at his request to Dr. Feistmantel, but
too recently for learning his opinion.
The most remarkable instance I have examined is on the coast,
about 42 miles north of Cape -Howe, where, at a place called
Chouta (between Tura and Boonda), a cliff about 100 feet high,
formed of sand and white silicate of alumina, contains beds of
lignite charged with sulphide of iron, and which are full of phyto-
lites much allied to the living vegetation. From the clays, some
of which are nearly kaolin, articles of pottery have been formed.
It has been proved that, by distillation, a fair proportion of
lubricating oil may be produced from the lignitiferous clay, and
other products are expected to result from these deposits. The
cliff? is about 60 feet thick from the sea to the top of the clays,
and borings below the sea-level have shown a still greater
thickness.
These deposits lie between the horns of the little bay at Tura
and Boonda, resting at one end on the highly undulating Palaeo-
zoic rocks, and at the other on a mass of porphyry. They were,
formerly, no doubt, deposited in a depression among the slopes
of the hills, but the wearing away of the coast has left a cliff of
clay and sand instead of the original cliff of hard rocks. It is
remarkable that at the south end, the rocks assume the character
of a breccia of quartz cemented by siliceous matter (probably
like a deposit mentioned by Mr. Gould as occurring in Tasmania)
and in it analysis has detected the presence of gold, though some
quartz veins at the north end contained none.
My impression at first was that the lignite is recent, but I
place the deposits under the present head because it may be
possible, notwithstanding the opinion of a botanical friend whose
judgment is worthy of esteem, the plants are not recent. Baron
Yon Mueller, to whom I submitted them, hesitated to express an
opinion. They are deposited in clays of various kinds, chiefly
white. Some of the hardened clinker-like sands covering the
clays remind me of the sands on the coast of Dorset, at Studland
and Bournemouth. If this be really a Tertiary locality, it does
not contradict the general assertion at the commencement of this
section, for no shells of any kind have been detected in any part
of these beds. Swampy and stunted plants still grow on the
sands, which are very wet, and probably reproduce the phenomena
beneath them, with the exception of the white clays which were

in part derived from the decomposed felspathic matter of the

thin deposits, but on analysis they have proved valueless. _
By far the most interesting discovery that lias been made m
relation to the plant-beds was realized in the basaltic district of
The Forest between Orange and Carcoar.
In the vicinity of the latter place are deposits of calcareous
rock of the age of the Wellington Cave osseous breccia, also con-
taining fragments of bone. I believe some specimens have been
gent to Europe. . J J , , , ~
But these have not the same interest attached to them as
the plant remains have. . ,
The description of several new genera and species ot these has
been given in ? Observations on New Vegetable Fossils of the Auri-
ferous Drifts," by Baron E. Yon Mueller, C.M.G., M.D., Ph.D.,
F.E.S., and L.S., Government Botanist, &c.; published by the
?Mining Department? of Victoria, 1874. These have beeu dis-
covered�not only in The Forest, hut also in Victoria, at Haddon,
Nintingbool, Tanjil, and at Beechworth. They seem to belong to
the later Pliocene formation, and to consist of plants allied to
the present forest-belt of Eastern Australia. An abstract of the
first account of them was read before the Geological Society on
22nd June, 1870, and afterwards copied from the Quarterly
Journal (vol. xxvii) into the ? Geological Magazine ? 1870,
and, probably, some others.
This last species was discovered somewhere near Carcoar, in
one of the gold-leads, in the beginning of March, 1875, on the
10th of which month I had the good fortune to re-discoi ei it in


the refuse from a shaft near Lumpy Swamp, in The Forest,
between Orange and Carcoar. Baron Yon Mueller having
stated in his Report of 29th July, 1874, that we require to learn
what was the nature of their leaves and floral organs? ; in order
to search for these, I made a second journey to The Forest, having
first explored it in 1872, and found, together with four specimens
of Fliytidocaryon JVilJcinsonii and a number of already described
species, several leaves embedded in a ligneous clay in the refuse
of a shaft, together with portions of the branches of some tree or
trees. The tissue of the leaves was in some cases so thin that it
peeled off on touching. The collection, which included a few
other specimens of seeds and seed-vessels given to me by Mr. A.
Montgomery, who lives in the neighbourhood, I sent on to the
Baron, who said he would forward them to Professor Schimper,
of Strasbourg, as he himself was unable at the time to undertake
their examination. In a short time, therefore, we may expect to

The occurrence o� Bauksia (four species) in the Tertiary for-
mations of Hoering, in the Tyrol (see Clarke s Southern Gold
Fields ,? p. 173) and in Victoria, is a highly instructive fact as to
the ancient vegetation of the world. The seed-vessels of plants
deep below the surface of the auriferous drifts of Victoria and
New South Wales were also mentioned by me in 1860, in the
work alluded to above (p. 173).
In 1876 I collected a number of seed-vessels and leaves from
the ?leads? of Home Eule, and since then Mr. Wilkinson has
made a considerable addition, from the auriferous deposits at
Gulgong, to the species described, from the district of The Forest
and Beneree.
Baron Von Mueller has described them as in the following list: ?
Ochthodocaryon ... ... ... Wilkinsonii.
Eisothecaryon semiseptatum.
Illicites asfrocarpa.
Pentacoila Gulgongensis.
Pleiacron ... ... ... ??? elachocarpum.

At Beechworth (El Dorado) occur wood and leaves in variably
coloured clay above coarse drift, covering black clay with wood
and leaves ; and below this, two to eight feet of washdirt, holding
fruits and woods, resting on granite. (From Mr. Arrowsmith?s
plan. Id.)
Professor M?Coy has enumerated in the list of Tertiary Vic-
torian fossils between thirty and forty Oligocene species; thirty
to fifty or more Miocene, together with many tropical types of
Dicotyledonous plants ; and from the auriferous drifts four Mol-
luscs, six Marsupials, and a Dingo, with the wood and fruit of a
Banksia and the foliage of Eucalyptus obliqua. These are partly
Pliocene and partly Post pliocene. He has also figured and de-
scribed a new Squalodon (8. Wilkinsonii) from the Cape Otway
coast Miocene beds, and some species of Carcharodon from the
The latter as well as other species of those genera marked *
found also at The Forest. In addition to these another has been
found.
Towards the north of the Cape York Peninsula the sandstones
are barren of fossils, and about the Cape seem to have more the
character of Latente , resting on Porphyry.
Mr. Wilkinson, in his researches among the tin-mines of New
England, recognized the drifts which in Victoria are considered
Pliocene?; and Mr, Norman Taylor and the late Professor


Thomson, in their paper ? On the occurrence of Diamond near
Mudgee ? {Trans. Dog. Soc. ofJT.S. W., 1870, p. 94) make mention
of older and newer Pliocene drift. Whether there be any fossil
evidence for the propriety of these terms I know not. That there
are drifts of different parts of one epoch I believe ; and, perhaps,
the divisions are good, even if the designations be too refined.
Dr. Duncan has advised us to postpone the Lyellian designations
for the present. Having very recently visited almost every
locality mentioned in that paper, and examined for myself much
of the alluvia of the gold-fields in a large portion of the county
of Phillip, I am prepared to testify to the extreme faithfulness of
the description given by Messrs. Taylor and Thomson. My
remark, therefore, about the term Pliocene is not to be taken as
complaining of it, but as a justification for the introduction of
some of the drifts in question under the present head. A dis-
tinction of . time is however clearly marked in the character of the
various deposits or in the difference of botanical remains.
Perhaps some of these deposits in the gold-fields, as well as
some of the shelly conglomerates at the mouth of the Flinders,
had better be considered as belonging to the next division of my
subject; and though placed as Tertiary, I am not satisfied they
are such, as no positive proof exists by unmistakable evidence
that they are so.
In the far Western interior, beyond the Darling, shelly deposits
of fine sandstone have been reached in well-making, and by the
kindness of my friend Mr. Woore, C.C.L. of the Albert District,
I have been put in possession of several good specimens, together
with fossil wood, apparently not very ancient, which I believe to
be Tertiary.
I have also from another contributor a very good specimen of
a Thalassina resembling T. Emerii, from another part of ? New
Holland,? which is said to have been found somewhere on the
right bank of the Darling, not far from Mount Murchison. For
the species alluded to, see the late Mr. Bell?s paper in Q.J.Gr.S.,
1, p. 93. Mr. B. received it from the late William S. Macleay!
Esq., F.R.S., of Elizabeth Bay, Sydney.
Mr. Daintree has stated in his views respecting the Desert
sandstone of his map, that it is a Kainozoic deposit, which once
covered the greater part of Australia. In the places where it is
in great force, in Northern Queensland, it overlies the Cretaceous
rocks, and underlies lava beds. It contains fossil wood ; and a
Tellina which I sent to Mr. Daintree, from the neighbourhood of
Leichhardt?s crossing-place, on the Flinder?s River, would, he
says, if coming from the desert sandstone, show that that forma-
tion is not lacustrine. In various parts of New South Wales
there are cappings of fine hardened sandstone which may have
some relation to the strata referred to.


Mr. Daintree lias, however, mistaken the locality he gives to
the Tallinn. He received, a portion of a Iriloiite, and. not a
Tallinn, from Barkly?s Table-land, and a cast of a whole one, which
would give to that locality a Devonian character.
There is no doubt a fine waterworn drift over large areas of
the auriferous and stanniferous regions and in the southern part
of Maneero ; but in many cases the drift betrays its origin, as the
result of the disintegration of conglomerates, and such I believe
to be the origin of the drift seen by Professor near
Wallerawang. (? Beport on Iron Ore nnd Coni Deposits ,? read
before the Eoyal Society, 9 Dec., 1874.) He compares it with
the diamond drift at Bingera, alluding to the ? nodules of con-
glomerate ? in each ; but this conglomerate may be found in situ
in the Coal-bearing beds close at hand.
Many drifts have undoubtedly been dispersed, and re-agglom-
erated and again dispersed, from one age to another, and the
fineness of the pebbles and their perfect attrition afford testimony
as to their antiquity, though now called recent.
The outliers of the Tertiary deposits in N. W. Australia and
what is called the ? Northern Territory ? (attached to South
Australia) are little known beyond the coast, but there is probably
a wide area between Cape Villaret on the North-w r est Coast and
the watershed of the Victoria Eiver in which Tertiary beds wall
be probably be found. The Eev. J. E. Tenison-Woods in 1864 *
points out the Coburg Peninsula as Tertiary, and Port Essington
was considered by Professor Jukes to have evidence of the same.
Judging from collections in my own cabinets, there must be,
however, a preponderance of far older formations. It is, never-
theless, also probable, from its auriferous conditions and the pre-
sence of granite and basalt, that there are Tertiary deposits in that
portion of the interior, and of which the basalt may be the igneous
representative. The Tertiary fossils of the South toast of Aus-
tralia, from near Cape Howe to Cape Eeeuwin, have been partially
known from the mention of them by several authors ; and those of
South Australia and the Murray Eiver have been more or less
elaborately treated of by Sturt, Eyre, Angus, and with critical
acumen by Woods, Busk, and Professor Tate of Adelaide. But
somehow the great sections, nearly GOO feet thick, along the
Australian Bight have yet to be catechised as to whether the
Australian Tertiaries follow the laws which ruled the existence
of these deposits in Europe, or whether the peculiar aberrations
noticed by Mr. Woods in some of his valuable writings are or are
not exceptions to those laws.

New Zealand also contains a great number of Tertiary genera
and species admirably detailed and arranged as belonging to the
Upper Pliocene, Upper and Lower Miocene, and Upper Eocene
m a Catalogue by Captain U. W. Hutton, F.H.S (?Geological
Siirvey Mw Zealand Wellington, 1873), of Tertiary Mollusca
and Echmodermata, m the collection of the Colonial Museum.
Ihe classification is based on the percentage of recent species
theproportions of which are 76, 34, 23, and 9 per cent. '
With respect to the Australian Tertiaries, however, no one
has done so much as the Rev. J. E. Tenison-Woods whose pub-
lications on the Wetonan, Tasmanian, and South Australian
strata are numerous and valuable. To enumerate them here
would be unnecessary, as they will probably ere long be brought out
by himself in a form available for the public benefit, and to the
public appreciation of his long and persistent studies. Besides
his numerous papers published elsewhere, Mr. Woods has con-
tributed in 1877 to the Royal Society of New South Wales, no
less than four papers showing great ability and very extensive
mowledge of his subject. It appears from his researches, that
there are peculiarities in the Australian beds, and that it would
not be altogether safe in relation to Australian deposits to trust
to European arrangements ; nor does he think it clear that the
Queensland cretaceous beds are altogether distinct from a com-
mingling with Tertiaries. He has adopted also a view which
must to a great extent be true, as to the sudden upheaval of
P�J 10 - of t he Southern Coast of New Holland. As to the
u?* 116 Aust I rah l an Bl ght which have never yet been scien-
tifically examined, there must have been at least 600 feet of
elevation, but the fossiliferous beds appear to rest on granite, of
which the slopes are abrupt, and which descend according to a
statement made to me by the late Capt. Owen Stanley, R.N.
;a? an e] M� rm n ou . s de P th > �f which mention is made in
Geol. Mayazme, vol m., pp. 503-551. Considering the depths
sounded by the Challenger ? there is nothing remarkable in the
idea that there may be depths within the assumed distance from
the shore as great as any m the Atlantic or Pacific Oceans, or
even greater, taking into account the general freedom from
islands and reefs, regarding the granite as an evidence of upheaval,
and its structure in vast nodular or spherical concretions. That
such upheavals occupying even large areas along the Southern
coast, are not inconsistent with subsidences of very great depth
and extent on the East coast of Australia, offers no difficulty to
those who regard such occurrences as the result of causes
generally affecting the bottom of the ocean.
, f hofessor Tate of Adelaide has already given a fresh impetus
to the study of Australian Tertiary Geology, by his investigations
spec mg the Murray beds, and by the discovery among them


o� two species of fossils which have hitherto been held Creta-
ceous, an additional example of the manner in which certain
genera ascend in time to overlying formations (see pp. 16, 31).
The latest discovery of the existence of Tertiary Marine fossils
is on the S.E. Coast of New Guinea. On the voyage of the
? Chevert,? the Hon. W. Macleay obtained a series of rocks and
fossils, which I had the pleasure of seeing, and considered to be
Tertiary. Since then they have been examined by Mr. C. S.
Wilkinson, whose experience of the Victorian Tertiaries is so.
well known. He has determined (? Proc. Linn. Soc. NS. W vol.
the following Lower Miocene shells, from Hall's
which he recognizes as known in Victoria, and

of which two have been described by Prof. McCoy (? Prodrom -

Macleay, Esq., F.L.S., Sfc., from the Coasts of New Guinea, Cape-
York, and neighbouring Islands: Bg C. S. Wilkinson, F.G.S., Gov.
Geologist."
The matrix of these fossils is described as exactly that of the-
Lower Miocene beds near Geelong and Cape Otway. At Katau,
on the west side of the Bay of Papua, there are also fragments
of shells in clay similar to those of Hall?s Sound and Yule
Island.
As described by Mr. Macleay, 11th Oct., 1875, Yule Island
has a considerable inward dip from a horizontal face of cliff.
The rock is calcareous, with corals, shells, echini, &c., bedded like
the coral rag of Oxford. H?Albertis mentions basalt in the-
valleys, and coralline cappings on the hills, which reach a height
above the sea-level of from 600 to 700 feet. In Victoria there
is a similar arrangement ?? Yellow and blue calcareous clays
full of fossil shells, overlaid by thick beds of coralline limestone,
consisting of an aggregate of comminuted fragments of shells
and echinoderms.?
Mr. W ilkinson regards the ferruginous capping of the porphyry
of Cape York, which is but 90 miles distant from the Papuan
coast, as Tertiary, and that the New Guinea beds may be yet
found in the Cape York Peninsula. Of course, future researches


may discover fresh deposits of Tertiary age, but so far as
examination of the collections in my possession from Cape
York, New Guinea, Brighton Cliffs, Flemington, &c., may serve
as a guide, there is no proof of anything further than a resem-
blance in the colour and composition of the ferruginous sand-
stones of the Victorian localities to justify the supposition at
present.
Dr. Eattray (Q.J.G.S., xxv. 297), in his ? Notes on the
Geology of Cape York Peninsula ? (read 2nd May, 1869), says
distinctly: ?No fossils have been detected ? in the sandstone
? between the volcanic rock beneath and the superimposed Post-
tertiary ironstone,? in the bold cliffs of Albany Island and the
opposite mainland. He mentions also that the Jardines, in
their traverse of the Peninsula, found the same rock at various
parts of their route ; but he says also, that at the nprth end of
Albany Island, where a boss of porphyry protrudes and dis-
places the overlying sandstone and ironstone, fine examples of
chertified clay, ironstone, and quartzite may be seen at their
point of contact ? (p. 302.)
Now, Mr. Wilkinson gives a list of rock specimens as follows:
1. Quartz porphyry (Palaeozoic) (?) from Cape York, found
underlying beds of Tertiary (?) ferruginous sandstone.
2. Vesicular basalt and brecciated volcanic tufa (Upper
Tertiary), from Darnley Island.
3. Small concretions of limonite, with polished looking sur-
faces, dredged up off the Coast of New Guinea.
4. Specimens of Chalcedony and flint, from Hall?s Sound.
5. Oolite limestone (Tertiary), very friable, from Bramble
Bay.
0. Yellow calcareous (Tertiary), from Katau Eiver.
7. A r ellow and blue calcareous (Tertiary), from Yule
Island and Hall?s Sound.
Whether No. 4 has any relation to the ? chertified clay
ironstone ? of Eattray I know not, but it is certain that there
arc many instances to be found in New Guinea of highly altered
strata. No. 3 is also a common variety of iron ore in many
places besides those indicated, e.g., at New Harbour, 100
feet above the sea, wdiere the nodules of iron have the exact
hind of polish mentioned in No. 3, and are of considerable size.
[Similar nodules, but of red species, occur also at Port Essing-
ton, on the opposite horn, so to speak, of the Gulf of Carpen-
taria.]
Although I do not go fully into particulars respecting evi-
dence in my own possession concerning the Tertiary beds in the
localities already mentioned, yet I may state that the calcareous
rock of light colour occurs on various points between the coast


and tlio Astrolabe Range, and, according to the data given me by-
officers of H.M.S. ? Basilisk,? near Eedscar Head, at an elevation
of 100 feet. I consider these beds to be Miocene also.
There are also junks of fossil-wood with thin veins of calcspar.
It may be well, in conclusion of this section, to allude to the
facts pointed out in the previous parts, relating to the occurrence
of genera and species in formations older than those in which
they may usually occur.
In reference to such a contingency in Tertiary strata ot Aus-
tralia, the Rev. Mr. Woods in one of his papers seems to hesi-
tate as to the passage into the Tertiaries from the Cretaceous,
at the time of writing, he having seen no good grounds for the
admission of such an occurrence. But since the date of that
paper [? History of Austr. Tert. Geol.? read before Roy. Soc. las.,
11th July, 1876], we find his admission [?Jouru. Roy. Soc.
N. S. TV.? xi., 75, 1877] of two genera of generally considered
Mesozoic? ago having been found in the acknowledged Middle
Tertiary strata of Aldinga, in South Australia ?species each of
Belemnites and Salenia? discovered by Professor Tate [See Q. J. G-.S.
Peb. 7, 1877, xxx., p. 206.] He adds, that though Salenia was
considered to be extinct, and a characteristic ot Mesozoic form,
? a living species was dredged up by the ? Challenger.?
Dr. Duncan, President of the Geological Society, remarked
on the interest attached to the discovery of the Belemnite,
which ? added another to the curious examples of the survivors
of older forms of life in Australia.? As he expressed it, it was
another of the Cretaceous forms ? which had outlived the Cre-
taceous period. This and similar discoveries showed the impos-
sibility of comparing Australian and English strata on purely
Palaeontological data.? Other speakers confirmed the occur-
rence of such an apparent anomaly by facts from other localities.
Mr. Woods does not, however, think the doctrine of evolution
can be sustained from Australian evidences, and has an explana-
tion of his own, not revealed.
He says, further, that ? during more than twenty years of
researches in Australian Tertiary geology I have sought for any
reasonable evidence in favour of evolution, or clue to its mode of
operation, and have found none whatever. I must add, that
Australian geology, whether reluctantly or not, must admit that
she can urge nothing in favour of that theory being true, the true
explanation of nature as we find it. ?


He concludes also, that ? to assert that any part of the con-
tinent has been preserved as dry land since the Mesozoic period,?
would be a hasty conclusion, ? and that the weight of evidence is
against it.? (? Hist. Aust. Tert. Geol op. cit., p. 25.)
� 7. Quaternary Formation and Recent Accumulations.
The Quaternary Fauna of Australia has been so loug known
by the patient and skilful researches of Professor Owen, that
there is no need to do more than refer to his writings as the
source of most of our knowledge respecting the strange animals
that preceded the human epoch and perhaps extended into it.
Huxley and others have also added to the general history of these
creatures.*
The Diprotodon appears not to have been limited to any one
portion of Eastern Australia, for its remains have been found in
South Australia and Queensland as far north as the York
Peninsula.
In many of the ? gold-leads? also, fragments of bones are
found. A section of one sample, at Wattle Flat, above the Turon
River, is given in my paper on ? Fossil Bones" (Q.J.Gr.S., xi.,
p. 405, 1855), and in ? Anniversary Address to Royal Society,
N.S.W., 1873,? p. 14.
One of the most receut discoveries of the extinct kangaroos is
that of a portion of a skull of Sthenurus minor, from the district
of the Castlereagh River, described by Professor Owen (? Proceed.
Zool. Soc., April 17, 1877 ?) as having relations to Dorcopsis
* An anecdote may be introduced hero which may have some interest for
visitors to the Australian Museum. In 1847, Mr. Turner sent to Sydney a
box of bones from King?s Creek, in Darling Downs, and Dr. Leichhardt, Mr.
Wall (then Curator of the Museum), with myself examined them, and found
there nearly the whole of the bones of the head, though in fragments only,
besides other prominent portions of the Diprotodon skeleton, which had only
been then partially known to Professor Owen, who had not at that time seen
the upper jaw. So far, therefore, this individual was unique. With much
trouble we put the bones together, and a cast was afterwards made of the
skull, which is still in the Museum. A paper contributed by myself (dated
30th November, 1847), and afterwards re-published in the Appendix to my
Report of 14th October, 1853 (? On the Geology of the Condamine River?),
and some letters from the late W. S. Macleay, Esq., and Dr. Leichhardt,
detailed the characters of the animal as far as they were then known, and the
condition and other contents of Mr. Turner?s collection. This would not
deserve any mention here, but for the sake of introducing a curious event
relating to the head of the Diprotodon alluded to. Mr. Turner sold his
collection to the late Mr. Benjamin Boyd, who sent it to England. The ship
was wrecked at Beachy Head, on the coast of Sussex, and the collection, form-
ing part of the relics of the cargo which were sold, was taken to London, and
Professor Owen bought it of the dealer who had become its owner, not know-
ing its history.


(Mueller). It was given to me by Mr. Lowe of Gooree. I for-
warded it to Professor Otfen, who deposited it in the British
Museum as the type of the species.*
lii many parts ot the existing region, all over the surface,
wherever the basalt rock is not denuded, also near Sydney, there
are local deposits which might be called ?till,? were any Testacea
found in them; and in the Interior there are widely spread
accumulations of drift pebbles, which, as on the Hunter and
Wollondilly, are rounded by attrition in their long journey from
the mountains whence they have been derived. Sometimes, also,
the breaking up of conglomerates has contributed to this drift.
On Peak Downs there are deep accumulations of drift, such as
transmuted beds of the Carboniferous formation, igneous rocks
such as porphyry and basalt, and fragments ot the older I alseozoic
formation. Many of these are encrusted with thin calcareous
cement, which forms cups of clear calc-spar in hollows ot a tine
porphyritic grit ?the same grit occurring on the AVarrego, on the
Ballaudoon and Narran ridges, with transmuted quartzite, also
in wells there and on the Darling near Port Bourke, in which
drift fine gold was detected by me to exist on the Downs, and
has been again reported to me from the base of Rankin?s Ranges
on the Darling River, the furthest known A\ estern auriferous
locality in New South Wales.
In 1869 I reported the discovery of the femur of a bird, at the
depth of 188 feet, in drift resting on granite, from a well in that
part of Peak Downs (22� 40' S.) which lies between Lord's Table
Mountain and the head ot Theresa Creek, near the track from
Clermont to Broad Sound. Compared with the bones ot Diuoinis
in the Australian Museum, both the Curator ot that institution,
and myself came to the same conclusion as to its genus, and
accordingly it was reported in the ? Geological Magazine" as
Dinorms. Professor Owen has, however, removed it, into another
genus Dromornis, considering it to have belonged to a Struthioid
bird. If it was such, of course (especially after the deep sound-
ings between Australia and New Zealand, established by H.M.B.
? Challenger? in 1874), the speculations ! indulged on a possible
former connection between those countries as illustrated by such
* See ?Journ. Hog. Sac. N. S. W. 1877,? vol. xi., p. 209. With reference
to this I have a communication from Professor Owen, dated 11th February,
1878, of which the following is an extract: ?? I thank you for your timely
appeal for the preservation of skulls and skeletons of the existing Marsupials
prior to their extinction? that is but a question of time. Man is fated to
that function, save in regard to snch species, man inclusive, of which he can
make anv profitable use! It is an encouragement to study and to describe
your fossils, to find ? Papers? so kindly commended as mine on Sthenurus
minor. When shall we get a skull or jaw, or fragment of jaw with teeth, ot
your old 25-foot-long-lizard, Megalania prisca? It was contemporary with
Diprotodon.?


a discovery are worth little. But if it was a Dromornis, then it
falls in with the relationship to a present bird, the Emu, just as
the Kangaroos of this epoch are related in structure to the
gigantic Marsupials of a past age.

Mr. Thomas Cockhurn Hood?s discovery of crocodilian remains
in New Zealand seems to establish in another way some possible
connection long ago with distant regions, and crocodiles are yet in
Queensland, the nearest probable land in the supposed insular or
present fragmentary alliance with the former country.
The Northern coasts and islands would show also similar rela-
tions to New Guinea, and the only difference between the
present conditions of such connections consists in the shallow
seas of the,present period in the latter, and the deep ocean
between the points of direct communication in the other.
That the Pacific Ocean was formerly over wide areas now
occupied as land has been a favourite view with many geographers;
and although the Great Pacific Continent is rejected by others,
yet there are not wanting additional proofs to sustain the decision,
as to a great part of the ocean, as held by Fournier. (See
infra.)
Africa and India, as well as Australia, New Zealand, and New
Guinea, were probably in parts united. Not only do fossil plant
remains add testimony to the probability, but the wingless birds,
the reptiles, the vegetation of the present period, and the Marsu-
pialiaseem to connect the Northern regions, whilst, as Mr. Blan-
ford shows in his interesting paper, ? On the Plant-hearing series
of India or the former existence of an Indo-Oceanic Continent'''
(see Q.J.G.S.,xxxi.,p. 510), a similar connection took place to the
West.
It is not unsatisfactory, as to possible union of New Caledonia
and New Holland, to find a similar view taken, upon grounds
distinct from fossiliferous evidence or that of birds and reptiles.
I nder the head of ? Geographic Bofanique? in the ? Comptes
Bendus des Sciences de VAcad? e ' des Sciences," tome 76, p. 77),
there is a paper by M. Eug. Fournier, entitled, ? JSotice sur la
Dispersion Geographique des Eougeres de la Nouvelle Caledonie .?
The author gives a list of ferns special, as well as common to
that group and to the islands of Polynesia and of the Pacific in
general, &c., including New Holland, New Zealand, and Tasmania,
in which latter group he finds 58 common to New Caledonia out


of 289, showing that the latter is the head-quarters of those
plants ; and he reasons from this fact that New Caledonia was at
some period connected with Australia by means of Norfolk Island
and perhaps other submerged islands and with New Zealand and
the Auckland Islands. � This hypothesis,? he says, will explain
the simultaneous presence in lands at present under the influence
of differing climates of species belonging to homogeneous groups,
which could not by any causes have been transported by special
currents, and which, living in the mountainous inner regions, are
less exposed than littoral species to be carried away by exterior
* "This hypothesis tallies completely with the possibility of the
connection I presumed from the evidence o 10 s^Ppo
Dinornis,?which, however, is more strongly confirmed by 1 rot.
Owen to be Dromornis, since he has examined in addition to the
femur from Queensland, a tibia from S. Australia, and the portion
of a pelvis I sent him from N. S. Wales.
To the above considerations may be added, that Baron ion
Mueller having examined the plants brought from New Guinea
bv the Hon W. Macleay, F.L.S., shows such resemblances with
certain Australian species as to confirm M. Fournier s opinion
respecting the former probable connection ot the two great
islands ; this is properly referred to in Mr Wilkinson 8 paper on
the Geological Collections o� the ? Chevert Expedition, previoush
%*ho C lc t c�ouut 9 o� ) the plants hy Baron von Mueller is to bo
found in three parts of a treatise entitled ? on
Papuan Plants : Melbourne." (Nov., 1870, to April, 18/6 )
Remains of reptiles have also been found both in N. b. AV ales and
other parts of Australia, in Quaternary deposits, as lor instance
Menalania prisca (Owen), a Lacertian allied to the A ar an sand
Lace Lizards of Australia, which had, probably, a length of -o
feet; and in the great plains of the Interior bones of various
gigantic marsupials, fishes, and reptiles are found bedded m
black muddy trappean soil; and on Darling Downs, in Queens-
land univalve and bivalve shells are found in some cases attached
to the bones, or deposited over them in a regular series ot layers
at intervals of several feet ; and of these shells some are yet
livin" in the water-holes of the creeks. These facts are generally
known, but it was not till recently that the osseous relics have
been found in different creeks throughout the whole ot the slopes
and plains at the base of the Cordillera in Eastern Australia ; m
Victoria, in South Australia, and North Australia also. Ot
similar age are the accumulation of bones in caverns, as at \Vel-
lington : at Boree; near the head of the Colo River; at
Yesseba, on the Macleay Biver ; at the head of the Coodradigbce ;
not far from the head of the Bogan, and in other places.


A magnificent collection of the remains in the Wellington
Caves has been made, at the instigation of Professor Owen, at the
<mst of the New South Wales Government, with the superin-
tendence of the Trustees of the Australian Museum, by one of
them, the late Professor Thomson, and by Mr. Gerard Krefft,
P.L.S., C.M.L.S., &c., the late Curator of that Institution.
The Reports of these gentlemen, together with more than a
thousand partly determined specimens, were forwarded to Pro-
fessor Owen, who has expressed his acknowledgment of the
value of this collection, ? as regards novelty, instructiveness, and
encouragement for the future,? and as an ?important element
in working out the ancient history of the forms of animal life
peculiar to Australia.?
The Coodradigbee caverns will repay research hereafter. They
have already furnished me with bones of birds, in which those
of an Emu are prominent.
The latter fact chimes in with the alleged Promornis of
Queensland.
1 rofessor M C oy has named bones of a Dingo in a cavern near
Mount Macedon. If it be really a dog of this period in Australia,
it is another link between the Quaternary and Decent times.
Vicomte d?Archiac, however, doubts its antiquity: ? Rien,? he
says, ? neprouve que ce chicn nait pas etc introduit par les premiers
homines qui ont peuple le continent Australian .? (? Legons sur la
JPaune Quaterniaire, Paris,? 1866, p. 271.)
An expedition to Howe?s Island made known, in 1869, the
-existence of bones of birds and turtles embedded in the beach
rock of the island. Afterwards, a collection of them was sent to
me by Mr._ Leggatt, of Fiji. I forwarded them to Professor
Owen, who informed me that he was unable to determine to what
they belonged owing to their imperfect state. They undoubtedly
belong to some period near to the present, as the rock is a coral
limestone common to the coast of the Pacific Islands ; and that
deposit also contains a Bulimus scarcely distinguishable from a
living shell of the same genus off the Island, and eggs of Turtle
also embedded as in Raine Island in the Barrier Reef. (See
<l Trans., Roy. Soc. JV.S.W .,? 1870, p. 37.)
Within the last few years, the drifts of the Cudgegong and
Macquarie Rivers have been searched for diamonds, first reported
in 1860 by myself as occurring in numbers in the latter river.
Many thousand examples have been found ; but they are chiefly
imiall and of little value, though a few have been found of larger
size and have been cut and polished.
A few have been brought to me from other localities in New
South Wales, and some have been found in Victoria.
Mr. Norman Taylor examined the forms of the mineral as it
occurs at Two Mile Flat, &c., and figured them with care. [See


for collected references on Diamonds in Australia, in I rofessor
Liver si clue's paper, u On .il Linernls of Now South IP ales, Trans,
Boy. Sac., A 7. S. W., ix., p. 183, 1875; and W. B. Clarke?s ? Ann.
Address," 1872.]
In other publications I have treated of them ; and since then
the Bingera Diamond I'ield has received careful attention from
Professor Liversidge, who has described its condition accurately.
Those found since 18G0 have fully justified the heading of my
notice published that year (? Southern Gold Fields," p. 272),
? New South Wales a Diamond Country.?
The Rev. Dr. Bleasdale, P.G.S., has published many valuable
details of the Victorian gems.
Looking to the Colony of New South A\ ales, we find that in
more than one instance the present river channels have deepened
since the drift first began to crowd their banks. I have traced
one of these drift streams, sometimes at great heights above the
valleys, for more than 80 miles. In some places I have found
upon the surface, as Strzelecki did in other parts, minerals
(especially ores of copper, tin, and lead) which were at a great
distance from their sources; and in two instances, that rare
mineral, Molybdate of lead, of which no habitat has ever been yet
found ; and about three years ago a lump of Sulphuret of anti-
mony, weighing three pounds, and exhibiting surface evidence of
its being a drifted substance, was disinterred from the superficial
ironstone gravel of an unfrequented place on one of the heights
of the north shore of Port Jackson.
Some years since I reported on the occurrence of mercury in
this Colony ; but my expectation of the discovery of a lode of
Cinnabar has been disappointed. The Cinnabar occurs on the
Cudgegong in drift lumps and pebbles, and is probably the result
of springs, as in California. In New Zealand and -in the neigh-
bourhood of the Clarke River, North Queensland, the same ore
occurs in a similar way. About 1841 I received the first sample
of quicksilver from the neighbourhood of the locality on Carwell
Creek, on the Cudgegong, where the cinnabar is found. I pro-
posed a full examination of that locality when I was in the
neighbourhood in February, 1875 ; but the state of the weather
was such as to preclude the possibility of doing so during my
limited stay. But I was informed that the progress of the mine
was satisfactory.
As connected with the drifts may be mentioned the occurrence
of gems of all kinds in all the rivers where auriferous deposits
occur, and subsequent years have only served to abundantly con-
firm my statement of 18G0 as to the general distribution of them
in the gold-bearing districts.


In examining the gold alluvia at a variety of shafts about Gul-
gong, Home Rule, and other places in the county of Phillip, I
was struck by three prominent circumstances which have bearings
upon the present and future of that region :
1. No shaft is, so far as I learned, deeper than 200 feet.
2. The gravels of the alluvia were composed of pebbles and
fragments of rock common in the vicinity?derived from
Carboniferous and underlying strata, with occasional
fossils.
3. The quartz pebbles were in some cases perfectly rounded ;
in others the quartz was in fragmentary lumps, as if
recently broken from reefs. These did not appear to
occur together.
The conclusion I drew from the latter fact was that two periods
of destruction and one of abrasion of underlying reefs had taken
place at an early period of alluvial deposition. A fourth circum-
stance might be commented on. In the deposits of the shafts a
multitude of well worn abraded lumps of jasper, silicified fossil
wood, and semi-opal of various tints and chalcedonic interchanges,
in some instances themselves decomposing so as to exhibit the
fibres of the wood from which they had been formed by transmu-
tation, arrested attention, and showed that either an older series
of Carboniferous rocks had suffered such changes, or the beds of
the series which now exhibits itself in various outliers had under-
gone the process. Mr. Lowe, of Gooree, has made a most ex-
tensive collection of these altered fragments, in which are many
very beautiful specimens. It will probably never be rivalled, as
he collected them from time to time as they were disinterred by
the diggers. A great number also were coated with a shining
transparent envelope of what I believe to be a deposit from
silicified water. Elsewhere (? Trans. Hot/. Soc. N.5.W. ,? 1870, p.
11) I have dwelt upon this; and it also attracted the attention
of Professor Thomson and Mr. Norman Taylor, These deposits
are frequently covered by a great thickness of basalt, upon which
frequently lies a more recent drift partly derived from older
drifts. The colours of the alluvia, now long exposed, rival in
some degree those poikilitie hues which distinguish the west end
of the Isle of Wight.
A drift of local kind also occurs over large areas in Maneero
in the neighbourhood of the auriferous strata, as also in New
England over the country of the tin-mines, which exhibits the
same sort of alluvia as the gold-fields, and in which also gold
occurs. In 1851-3, when I discovered the first tin in the
Colony, it was generally in association with gold and gems.
Messrs. Ulrich, Wilkinson, and Liversidge have since that time
made local explorations both in the alluvia and in the beds from
which they have been derived. There are deposits of opals


besides those in the gold-drifts ; and on Lawson s Creek, a feeder
of the Cudgegong, agate breccias and opals occur. Opaline veins
also occur in the basin of the Abercrombie Liver ; in that of the
Barcoo. in Queensland; and about 25 miles S.E. of Cudgellegong
Lake, on the Lachlan Eiver.
At the mouths of the Eichmond and Clarence Eivers gold is
found distributed in the sands and covering pebbles of the sea
beach; a similar distribution is found in the sands ot > hell
Harbour Illawarra (where the accumulations above-named occur),
and some gold was extracted. Other spots give similar indica-
tions ; and' one specimen of gold was brought up from the sea-
bottom by the sounding operations of H.M b. ? Herald, oft Port
Macquarie. Gilded pebbles also occur 011 the West coast ot Aew
instances have also been recorded of gold having
been found in the gizzards of wild fowl and of domestic poultry,
in various parts of the Colony, confirming, with the above-
mentioned facts, the almost universal distribution ot the precious
metal in river-drifts and superficial deposits. Some of the above-
named examples of gold collected by birds were exhibited by me
at Sydney and in Paris in 1855, and are still in my possession.
All along the coast, from Torres?s Strait to Bass s strait dritt
pumice may be found wherever there is a lodgment, generally in
the north corner of the little shore bays. That this has gone on
for ages is apparent, as in one part ot the coast north ot Av ollon-
o-ong there is an accumulation of water-worn pumice some dis-
tance from the shore, and beyond the reach of the present waves.
It is supposed to come in during easterly gales, from the \ olcanic
islands to the north-east. In 1841 this fact, and all the evidence
then collected in relation to such drift and ? atmospheric deposits
of dust and ashes,? were published in a paper I forwarded to the
� Tasmanian Journal ,? of which I)?Archiac (? Prog. de la Geol. )
was pleased to say it contained all that was known on the subject.
Subsequently received facts have only confirmed what was then
the coast of New South Wales are found ranges of
dunes, with a variety of shells, some of them rare, others common
as on Port Hacking and Cronulla Beach ; along the shores ot
Botany Bay; on the great flat between the Hunter and tort
Stephens, and along the Macleay Eiver, which now passes tor
many miles through the shelly accumulations ; and about Moreton
Bay and in more northern coast openings, shells and Marine
refuse form deep deposits, from which, as in Illawarra and
Broken Bay, a considerable profit is obtained by dredgers and
shell-collectors, for the production of lime.
Eespecting recent species very little is actually known ot
many of them, comparatively speaking, in any ot the Colonies.


Of course there are scattered notices and collections in Museums.
These, however, have not yet become historical. The Rev. J. E.
T.-Woods, is the only writer who has taken up the subject
systematically in Tasmania, and we are indebted to him for some
valuable lists, of which may be mentioned ? Description of New
Tasmanian Shells (. Proc , It. S. Tasm., 1875 and 1870)',? and
Census, with brief descriptions of Marine Shells of Tasmania
and adjacent Islands {Proc. It. S. Tasm., read 13 Mar, 1877).?
This, indeed, comprises long lines of the coasts of East, South-
east, and West Australia, embracing upwards of 550 distinct
species, besides those of the Tasmanian coasts and Bass?s Strait,
collected from various sources and especially from the compiler?s
personal researches.
The late Mr. Strange was a collector of Port Jackson Shells ;
but what became of his complete collection I do not know.
Some are, probably, in the Australian Museum, Sydney. Mr.
Brazier, C.M.Z.S., the Rev. R. E. King, 8.A., Mr. Hargraves,
Junior, and others, have also contributed many species ; and on
the whole, the catalogue must be an extensive "one.
Raised beaches also occur at various heights on I?ocky projec-
tions of the coast, indicating elevation of the laud, of which there
is distinct evidence in the recent period, not only in Moreton
Bay, but near Sydney, and thence to Bass?s Strait; also on both sides
of that Strait, and as far as Adelaide and King George?s Sound.
Mr. Selwyn gives data for assuming the elevation of the land to
have reached occasionally 4,000 feet in Victoria, but he has no
evidence of Tertiary Marine fossils above (500 feet. Unfortu-
nately, on the Eastern coast, having no Marine Tertiaries, we
have to found our deductions, as respects New South Wales, on
less secure data. Yet we have here evidence of another kind,
and pot-holed surfaces of considerable extent have been found by
me at various heights from 300 to nearly 3,000 feet.
In a brief memoir like the present it is impossible to quote all
the authorities, nor has time allowed a more satisfactory digest or
a wider range of statements. What has been thus collected is
brought together in the design of giving a concise summary of
the general Geology of the Colony, omitting, on account of its
perplexity, all specific reference to the igneous rocks traversing,
covering, transmuting, or supporting the Sedimentary deposits.
In this Edition many new facts have been introduced with the
view of bringing on the discoveries that have been made from
time to time to the present period, when a new system of
geological inquiry has been just instituted in this Colony.
If private independent travel and research have not been able
to accomplish more than this abstract discloses, it may be hoped
that now the Government has commenced the work from its own
resources, pecuniary and official, more will be accomplished than


has hitherto been done to work ont the intricacies of Australian
geology, to accomplish which in minute and thorough detail will
probably require the united exertions of many a v orker in the
held and the cabinet to the end ot the next century at least. In
the preceding pages it has been my lot to mention many of my
own discoveries ; but it has not been with any desiie to oienate
my endeavours or exertions; and some I have altogether omitted.^
In the first Edition of this paper mention was merely made of
the Cape York Peninsula, where ferruginous deposits occur on
the lower slopes and bases of porphyry hills. I may repeat
here what was added in the second Edition. Those deposits
were examined at the Mint, and no gold was detected ; but on a
recent comparison of their lithological character with that of
Tertiary beds from Elemington (in Victoria), I believe them to
be, if not Tertiary, ot similar origin to the LcttevUe ot India, and
of the Islands in the intermediate sea.
Dr Rattray, of H.M.S. ? Salamander,? who furnished me with
a map, and a collection to illustrate it, from the neighbourhood
of Cape York, and whose paper was read by me, in his absence,
before the Royal Society of New South Wales, more recently
published his views in extenso before the Geological Society of
London. He therein attributes to me an opinion that the thick
sandstones of the Peninsula are ot the age of the Hawkesbury
rocks of New South Wales.
I do not remember that I have expressed any opinion on tins
sandstone ; what was submitted to me was considered by me far
youuo-er That such sandstone, and even older deposits between
and the Gilbert River, may exist in the interior of
the Peninsula, is far from improbable. The data at present are
insufficient for further comment. It may belong to the Desert
sandstone of Daintree. _ r , .
But this inference may be permitted, that as tape iork is so
short a distance from the gold-bearing deposits of New Guinea,
and as, as is now proved, all the rivers running to the Gull 01 Cai -
pentaria from the Mitchell to the Nicholson inclusive rise 111
auriferous ranges, gold will probably be found in some parts of
the country along the back-bone of the Peninsula ; and although
my past examination of the rocks in the Louisiade Archipelago
has not proved gold to exist there, yet I agree with Mr. Dam-
tree in his last Report to the Queensland Government, that the
strike of the older formations justifies the belief that the Archi-
pelago and, I may add, other portions of the lands insulated in
that part of the Pacific, will eventually furnish their quota of the
precious metal. , , .
Several collections of New Guinea rocks have been sent to me ;
but although it was asserted strenuously that gold was found m
them, in the district visited by H.M.S. ? Basilisk,? I have not


been able to recognize the existence of any auriferous matrix,
though it is well known that alluvial gold Avas discovered during
the visit of H.M.S. ? Rattlesnake? on the coast at the other side
of the Island. I find, however, that nodules of excellent haunatito
occur at New Harbour, about 100 feet above the sea. We have
had satisfactory additions to our knowledge of that great Island
from the results of the Expedition so nobly undertaken by Mr.
Macleay. J
In IS/0 I added a remark or two about the discovery of a
1 ing Ceratodus in the Avaters ot Queensland in the preceding
year, the only preA'ious known existence of the genus being the
teeth found in Triassic European rocks to which that name Avas
given.
Ibis was an interesting addition to the living Trigonia
Cestracion, Terebratula, &c., of Australia, which connect the
present period Avith the forms of life once held to be extinct.
Inquiries respecting this curious fish have resulted in the dis-
covery of other species than that first found (Ceratodus Forsteri ),
and what is more extraordinary, fossilized teeth, of which I was
shown examples by Professor Wyville Thomson, who found them
in an excursion purposely undertaken in search of the fish durum-
the stay of H.M.S. ? Challenger? in Port Jackson.
Since the first description of the fish by Mr. Krefft, Dr.
Gunther, 1.R.5., has published a Aaluable ? Description of Gera-
todus, a genus of Ganoid Fishes recently discovered in rivers of
Queensland, Australia," in the '"Phil. Transactions" (part 11., 1871).
J he result is, that both Agassiz and Pander had, from teeth found
in the Lias and 1 rias of Europe, come to conclusions which the
li\ing Ceratodus fully justifies. Dr. Oldham also had reported
Ceratodus teeth Horn Maledi, south of Nagpur, in India. Aus-
tralia in this instance precedes India. The fish turns out to be
allied to Lepidosiren, and its habits are amphibian as it feeds on
grasses and weeds in fresh Avater.
. ll r - Gunther goes into a most elaborate and minute examina-
tion of anatomy of all parts of the fish, and a comparison
with other fishes of the same and different types. He sums up
thus?? The Dipnoous type is represented in the Devonian and
Carboniferous epochs by several genera ( Dipterus , Cheirodus ,
Conchodus, Fhaneropleuroii) ; it is then lost, down to the Trias and
Lias, where the scanty remains of a distinct genus, Ceratodus,
testify to its presence; no further trace of it" has been found
until the present period, Avliere it re-appears in three genera, one
ot Avhich is identical Avith that of the Mesozoic era. Now, at
present, scarcely any zoologist Avill deny that there must have
been a continuity of the Dipnoous type ; and it is only a proof of
the incompleteness of the palaeontological record, that avc have
to derive all our information regarding it from only three so very


distinct periods of existence. The Dipnoi offer the most remark-
able example of persistence of organization, not m fishes only,
but in vertebrates. On a former occasion I have shown that
numerous recent species of fishes have survived from the period
of the geological changes which resulted in the separation ot the
Atlantic and Pacific by the Central American Isthmus In
Ceratodus we have now found a genus which, as far as evidence
goes, persisted unchanged from the Mesozoic era; and in the
Sirenidc�, a, family the nearest ally of which lived in the lalieo-
This is a most valuable link in the connection of the old geologic
periods with the present era, and a fit conclusion for the account
above given, however unworthy that account may be, ot Quater-
nary and Recent accumulations. _
No o-eneral notice in this Memoir has been taken by me ot
igneous rocks ; but it may be suitable to state that there is, in
all the various Sedimentary formations noticed, distinct evidence
of the presence of igneous action ( hydro-igneous rather), and
their transmutation through such and allied agencies has left
an impress upon all the rocks more or less concerned, due i
references will be left to another occasion. ,
No particular or special reference could enter into the object
for which this Memoir is written ; but it is to be understood that,
though all the rocks have undergone a transmutation, this does
not constitute what geologists have understood by ??Metamorphic
system, of which, as before said, New South Wales, at least,
shows little or no visible trace. _ . . ,
In order to explain the position of Glossoptens in the I alseo-
zoic Marine deposits, I have appended two vertical sections one,
bv myself previously published in the ? Transactions of the
Royal Society of Victoria:' 1861, illustrating the Coal-seams at
Stony Creek; and the other showing the deposits at Greta, near
Anvil Creek, which has been reduced from one on a larger scale
kindly supplied to me by Mr. James Fletcher, Colliery A icwer,
to whom I am also indebted for a collection ot strata, the charac-
teristics of which I have given after careful examination ot them
and of other specimens collected by myself on former occasions.
The latter section illustrates a wide area on that part ot t lie
Hunter River. No. 2is about 10 miles west of No. L
I have also appended two sections, one from Mount A ictona and
the other from Burragorang, as well as a map showing portion
of the Wianamatta Basin?which were made to illustrate my
paper on ? Oil-bearing Deposits ? cited at p. 68, but which were
not then published.

N B -In the ? Quarterly Journal of the Geol. Soc. Lon.," Vol. 1., p. 407, under the head
of ?Accounts of certain species of Silurian fossils from Hobart?s Town, N.S.W.? !! the above
species are accredited to Mt. Wellington-and, the author adds, ? the same species are
found in Van Diemen?s Land, and besides them a great abundance of lietepora Cyatho-
phyllum, Calamopora , Clypeaster, and Dentalium, which are rarely met with in ] the
neighbourhood of Mt. Wellington. All these specimens were collected in the hills of
Morambiji to the south of the Blue Mountains, and the beds containing them are partly
covered, as at Hobart?s Town, with recent lignites.? !!!
This curious medley is described as ? extracted from the ? Vnjage de la Bonite: Oeol. et
Mineralvgie, par M.E. Chevalier,p. 332.
I have little doubt that the Silurian species came from the Murrumbidgee, and the
Carboniferous from Tasmania.?W.B.C.

Parmi ces cspeces, on en compte cent ct trois dont I?existenco n?a pas
encore ete signalee en Australie, cinquante-neuf qui sont nouvclles pour la
science et soixante-quatorze dont la presence a ete constatee dans le terrain
carbonifere de I?Europe.
Le tableau suivant dans lequel j?ai marque par un asterisque I?existence
de chacune des cspeces soit on Europe, soit dans Pune des trois ini porta utes
legions de 1 Australie, a savoir : la Nouvelle-Galles du Sud, la Tasmanie et
la terre de la Reine ou Queensland (*), permettra de saisir par un simple
coup d?ceil leur distribution dans ces cliverses eontrees.
(') II est assez remarquable que la colonie de Victoria n?ait encore fourui aucun fossile du
calcaire carbomfere, quoique les terrains paleozoiques n?y fassent pas dcifaut.

dont cent une, ou les deux cinquiemes a une petite fraction pres [? cent
soixante on ciuquante-neuf ou presque les trois cinquiemes.?W.B.C.]
se trouvent exclusivement dans la Nouvelle-Galles du Sud et n?ont jusqu?ici
de representants dans aucun autre pays.
II est a remarquer qu?un petit nombre de ces especes appartiennent a des
genres qui n?existent pas en Eui?ope. Telles sont: les Tribrachiocrintis, les
Clarkea, les Eurydesma, les Aphanaia et les Urosthenes.
En jetant un coup d?oeil sur les planches qui accompagnent mon travail, on
pourra se convaincre, en outre, que plusieurs especes ont pris un developpemeut
extraordinaire. Je citera, entre autres, le Cyathocrinus (Konincki , W. B.
Clarke, les Spirifer glaber, W. Martin, Darwinii, J. Morris, quelques especes
de Pachydomus et de Mreonia VAphanaia giyantea, L.-G. de Koninck, les
Aviculopecten Illawarrensis et lim.cejbrmis, J. Morris, et les Conularia inornata,
J. D. Dana.
On serait tente de croire que ces especes ont ete soumises a des influences
speciales ayant favorise leur croissance, si, a cote d?elles, il ne s?en trouvait
d?autres, qui n?atteignent pas la moitie de la taille qu?elles possedcnt generale-
ment en Europe. Telles sont les Loxonema consiricta, W. Martin, le Macro-
cheilus acutus, Sowerby, et la plupart des Gasteropodes.
Afin de deduire de I?enseinhle des especes decrites, la stratification des
terrains qui les ont fournies, j?ai du me borner a faire usage des quatre- vingt-une
especes europeennes que Ton compte parmi dies et de rechercher les assises
dans lesquelles elles ont ete decouvertes.
Cet examen m?a fourni la preuve que vingt-deux de ces especes etaient com-
munes aux assises taut superieures que moyennes et inferieures du calcaire
Carbonifere, que trente-six appartiennent exclusivement aux assises superieures,
cinq ou six a la fois aux assises superieures et moyennes et enfin six ou sept
aux assises inferieures. Mais il est a remarquer que tandis que les trentc-six
especes superieures renferment un certain nombre d?especes caracteristiques,
telles que les Lithosirotion basaltiforme et irregulars, les Producing fimbriatus,
punctatus et undatus, le Chonetes papilionacea, le Spirifer bisulcatus, les
Pleurotomaria yemmulifera et carinata, I? Etiomphalus catillus, le Loxonema
consiricta, etc., les assises moyennes et inferieures ne fournissent aucune des
especes qui les font facilement reconnaitre ; telles sont, entre autres, pour les
premieres le Spirifer striatus et le Syrinyothyris cuspidaius et pour les
secondes V Athyris Royssii, les Spirifer Mosquensis et laminosus, le Conocar-
dium Hibernicum et le Nautilus Konincki qui y font completement defaut.
Je crois done etre en droit de conclure que la plupart des roohes Carboniferes
de la Nouvelle-Galles du Sud appartiennent aux assises superieures du terrain ;
qu?unepartie,principalement celle qui renferme les Spiriferconvolutusetpinyuis,
var. rotundaius, peut etre attribute aux assises moyennes, et que si les assises
inferieures y sont representees ce n?est que par quelques lambeaux insignifiants
ou du moins tres-pauvres en fossiles. Je laisserai a d?autres les deductions
biologiques que Ton pourra tirer de I?etude de la faune Carbonifere que je
viens de decrire et de la comparaison avec celle des autres pays.
Je me bornerai a faire remarquer qu?il est probable que la mer dans laquelle
se sont developpes les animaux Carboniferes de TAustralie, etait en communi-
cation avec celle dans laquelle ont vecu les animaux de la meme epoqne qui se
trouvent actuellement en Belgique,aux environs de Vise et de Namur; en
Angleterre dans le Yorkshire; en Ecosse aux environs de Glasgow; en
Irlande pres de Cork et de Dublin, et en Allemagne dans la Silesie. Cette
mer existait encore alors que deja la majeure partie des roches Carboniferes
de I?Amerique et de la Eussie, ainsi que celles du Nord de ITrlande et des
environs de Tournai, de Feluy, de Soignies et de Comblain-au-Pont de notre
pays, etaient deja emergees et que les animaux qu?elles renferment etaient
en majeure partie detruits.

Extract from letter from Mr. Lonsdale in explanation of the foregoing List
? My dear Sir, ? Bradford-on-Avon, Wilts, 12 July, 1858.
?I have not been able to reply sooner to your letter of 13th March
and the answer which I now give will prove I fear very unsatisfactory.
The accompanying table contains a list of genera, and the number of species ;
but the species are believed to be all new, and three or four of the genera are
doubtful determinations. It is impossible,' therefore, to define precisely the
position of the beds which afforded the corals ; but the table contains also a
rough enumeration of the geological distribution in Europe and America of
the Australian genera; with some of the known localities. These details
may assist in approximating towards the age of the beds which yield your
Zoantharia. The genera Eavosites, Calamopora (as distinct from Eavosites),
Emmonsia, Alveolites, Csenites, Ptychophyllum, and Cystophyllum may be
assumed to be essentially Upper Silurian or Devonian, but it is impossible to
state whether the Australian strata belong to the former or to the latter or to
both. Negative evidence based on the absence of Halysites would lead to the
conclusion that the deposits are Devonian. Such evidence is, however, value-
less, as an additional number of specimens might afford evidence of the
existence of Halysites and other important genera. As respects the Carbon-
iferous series, the genera Syringopora and Clisiophyllum have each six species,
principally from British localities ; but Syringopora has four or five Silurian
and five Devonian, and these (4 -)- 5) neutralize any deduction which might
be drawn from the six Carboniferous. Clisiophyllum has two Silurian repre-
sentatives, though as far as known no Devonian. The genus might con se-
quently be deemed to indicate a Carboniferous age; it cannot, however, be
opposed to seven genera (Eavosites, &c.) above mentioned. Eavosites has been
said to occur in the mountain limestone, but I have not seen an example of it,
and the genera as generally received requires much additional consideration.

Sir R. I. Murchison, in 1856, for examination and description by Mr.
Salter, from whose MS. notes, sent to Mr. Clarke in 1858, the following
are named, in addition to a series of Zoantharia examined by the late
W. Lonsdale, Esq., F.G-.S. [See ? Remarks on Sedimentary Formations

Remarks on the preceding Lists.
Titk arrangement of the above fossils cannot be considered entirely satis-
factory, and it is due to the memory of my lately departed friend Mr. Salter
to give some explanation of the matter. It had long been my desire to place
in the M oodvvardian Museum, at Cambridge, as nearly a complete series of
rocks and fossils from New South Wales as I could obtain in the course of
my explorations in the Colony.
In November, 1814, T forwarded to my friend Prof. Sedgwick four large
casks containing the first series from ?districts named in Appendix 111.
One of these casks, it appears, did not reach its destination, and must have
been lost on the voyage, or ou its way to Cambridge. From the remainder
Prof. M?Coy, then engaged witli the Woodwardian Palaeozoic collections,
afterwards so ably discussed and described, in 1855, in the joint volume of the
two geologists (?Synopsis of the Classification of the British Pa/ceozoic Rocks,
with a systematic description of the British Palceozoic Fossils in the Geol.
Museum of the ZTniv. of Cambridge' ), undertook to describe and publish at
Ins learned colleague?s request and charge, in the ?Annals Magazine of
Bat. History, vol. XX, many of the vegetable and Marine fossils that
remained of my collection, under the title of?? On the Fossil Botany and
Zoology of the Rocks associated with the Coal of Australia,? and in one of the
present lists these so-described fossils have been enumerated.
In the year 1855, having entered upon a new field of research ?the former
having been confined chiefly to the examination of the Coal Measures and the
Marine fossils of the Upper Palaeozoic associated with them, as will be seen
by the letter (c) in the list already referred to?and having obtained a con-
siderable collection of fossds from the Middle and Power Palaeozoic rocks, I
fornaided to my friend Professor Sedgwick, in continuation of my purpose of
completing the exhibition of the New South Wales fossil succession, a series
of such fossils as would show that below the Carboniferous strata, Devonian
and at least Upper Silurian formations exist in this Colonv.
No description of the fossils having been obtainable from Cambridge, I
wrote both to Prof. Sedgwick and to Sir R. I. Murchison, the latter of whom
borrowed them at my request from the former, and submitted them to
Messrs. Lonsdale and Salter, who did their best to meet the necessity, but
could not complete the work.
A letter of the former I have already put in evidence, and extracts of letters
from the latter will be appended to tliese remarks, which are made public in
justice to my friends Sedgwick, Murchison, Lonsdale, and Salter, all of whom
are now deceased.
Subsequently to this I entered into further arrangement with Mr. Salter, who
undertook to complete a description, with figures, of a considerable number
of Lower Palaeozoic and Devonian species, but his death prevented the work.
This collection, therefore, was left undescribed, except in the way recorded,
till after the deaths of Murchison and Sedgwick. Not being able to know
what had been done with them by the former, I wrote to Professor Hughes,
his successor at Cambridge, who very promptly informed me that on inquiry
he was unable to learn what had become of these fossils, or whether they had
been returned to the Cambridge Museum?which, of course, he could nob
Determine from personal knowledge. As Mr. Salter said, that with those he
darned there were other ?several beautiful species,'? it is possible that some
valuable additions to palaeontology may have occurred, as he made particular


request respecting certain of them in the following memorandum: ??We
should like to have the localities of the above numbers, and of the following
corals and shells, viz. :
Massive Favosites, 2,983, 3,526, 3,540.
Cylindrical one, 2,507.
Flat one, 3,602.
Syringopora ?large, 3,540.
New genus, allied to Favosites, 3,616.
New genus, 3,597.
New genera. 3,553, 3,562, 3,588.
Heliolites, 3618.?
The localities were supplied by me.
In the same Memo, he says:?? Mr. Lonsdale is examining a few of the
corals. If he should be able to throw any light on which is Devonian, &c., I
am sure Sir Roderick will send you the information.? This was done, so far
as was possible, as I find several references to them, and to the endeavours of
Messrs. Salter and Lonsdale, in various letters from Sir Roderick, who, inde-
pendently of his private correspondence, made public mention of them in
? Siluria,? 4th Ed., pp. 18, 462, 276. Murchison further says, in one of his
letters to me, that had I sent my fossils to what he considered their ?proper
destiny? ?the School of Mines ?they would have been officially described
long before.
Writing on November 16, 1853, he says : ?? lam always glad to receive
your instructive letters, and was much pleased to find that you have been
throwing so much important light on the auriferous phenomena of Australia.
I will not fail to profit by your discoveries in the golden chapter of my forth-
coming ? Siluria.?.... I have long been anxious of having your Palaeozoic
fossils properly named and compared before my final chapter is printed.?
The above extracts are here introduced to show that no possible purposed
neglect occasioned the disappointment as to my earlier description of the
Palaeozoic collections made and forwarded by me to Europe. I may add
further, that acting on a suggestion of Mr. Salter that I should apply to Prof.
M'Coy, ?who is well qualified,? I did so, feeling that as I had been
indebted to him for the description of the Carboniferous Fossils from the first
contribution to Cambridge, it would have been gratifying to me to have
placed in his hands the Middle Lower Palaeozoics of the second contribution.
The learned Professor, in reply, stated that his engagements of a public
character were too onerous to allow him time to devote to more private work
of the kind, and courteously declined.
In this extremity I consulted Prof. T. Rupert Jones, who recommended me
to seek aid from Prof. De Koninck, of Liege, who ?after some delay on my
part, occasioned by circumstances which did not originate in any want of
continued zeal, but over which I had no control ?has most ably, indefatigably,
and willingly accomplished it, to his own reputation as I hope and believe,
and certainly with ranch honorable acknowledgment of myself.
I had myself begun the work in a small way by making drawings to scale
of more than 1,200 individual specimens collected by me from the Car-
boniferous beds, chiefly between the years 1843 and 1847, and including many
described by Prof. M'Coy and Do Koninck, and which were shown to the
former in the year 1860.
They were never published, and it was the feeling that it was a work beyond
my own powers to do justice to it, coupled with want of pecuniary means and
of leisure from my parochial duties, that induced me to look to professional


and acknowledged authorities in Palaeontology out of the Colony, and I am
proud to acknowledge that I have found many able and willing coadjutors
who have in many instances given me gratuitously the heartiest and most dis-
interested assistance.
It is with the intention of acknowledging this aid that I have said so much
respecting my two friends?Lonsdale, with whom I became acquainted more
than half a century ago, and Salter, with whom my acquaintance was more recent.
The following are extracts from the letters of Mr. Salter in continuation of
former quotation:?
? Museum of Pract. Geology,
? Jcrmyn-street, Loll don,
? May 9, 1856.
? I should have answered your letter some time ago (I have had it a few
weeks only in hand), but for the very reason that prevents my being able to
work at the Australian fossils in the way I should like. I thought to have
given you some additional information respecting them, but it is, I find, im-
possible at present, owing to the pressure of work falling on my department
? a sac l hiatus being made in all my calculations, and a period put to much
important work by the lamented death of Forbes. He could scarcely over-
take the work that necessarily falls on those who have to help every one with
fresh studies in the fossil groups, and how am Ito expect to do it ? We are
finishing off our own Silurian work for England, and besides are compelled to
attend to the wants of all the other departments of British geology. Under
these circumstances, it will be utterly impossible to make any fresh detailed
examination of the fossils you mention. The abstract sent to you by Sir
Roderick will have clearly answered one of your most important queries,
since there can be no doubt of a true Upper Silurian formation among your
fresh fossils ; the presence of Calymene , Encrinurus, and a plaited Penta-
merus quite settles that question. Peceptaculites, too, is a good Silurian
genus when combined with such fossils as the above.
? I have some time had in contemplation to give a short paper on some
fossils of Yarralumla, collected long ago, which are undoubtedly Silurian, but
now your new fossils have arrived it will enable me to add a figure or two of
tlie principal species of these, when a temporary leisure may enable me to
attack them. It will not be at present, but it will be a pleasure to me when
I have the time. Yours very sincerely,
? J. W. SALTER.?
?Mus. Pract. Geology, Jermyn-st.,
? London, Nov., 28, 1858.
? Your letter, just come to hand, convinces me that your Colony will no
longer need any illustration from Home.
? The specimens which you kindly sent to Cambridge, and which I have
examined in thorough, are, lam glad to find, only duplicates. I have not
attempted to define their species. To do so would be to work them out, and
I could, of course then send you an account of them easily. My avoca-
tions do not permit me any leisure; and though the presence of the
genera I mentioned do certainly indicate the Upper Silurian, yet the great
abundance of corals, both millepore- and cupcorals, with Productus and
Atrypa reticularis , is an association we never meet with here below Devonian,
still I cannot give you any specific names, except the very few opposite (vide
list p. 151). The Receptaculites is a beautiful thing that helps to illustrate the
genus for which I have long ago had materials, and if you allow me to des-
cribe that species along with another from Canada I shall be glad to do so.
? Yours faithfully,
?J. W. SALTER.?

Bacchus Marsh Sandstones.?? Now, perhaps, the Bacchus Marsh sand-
stones have to be placed as above or partly on the horizon of the Newcastle
beds. They may, perhaps, also be called the ? Q-angamoptens beds ; as so tar
as I could inform myself, they contain G-angamopteris only (coming in tins
very close to our Talchfr group, underlying the Coal-beds where Gangamo-
pteris preponderates).
The species described from here are :
Gangamopteris angustifolia, M'Coy
? spathulata ?
? obhqua ?
If this position is correctly assigned, then the Indian coal flora (with Glossop-
teris) is a third re-appearance of the Australian Lower flora, in the Upper
Marine beds, as in column marked b in the ? Systematic Table.
Hawkesbury and Wianamatta Beds.? Dr. Feistmantel makes the following
observations respecting these Although representing, perhaps, strata-
graphically two groups, they seem to me, from a palaeontological point ot view,
to be of the same age, or very nearly so. It is true they contain fishes, some
of which (one, Palceoniscus) are heterocercal, but another one seems not
heterocercal ( Cleitholepis granulatus) ?[But Egerton distinctly calls it
heteroc. ?W.B.C.] ?while of the third one the tail is not known. If we now
take into consideration that a Palceoniscus is known from the in
South. Africa, which are more than probably Trias, and if we consider tha
a Palceoniscus superstes, Eg., is described from Keuper in England, then wo
must not be astonished that a Palceoniscus should be found 111 these Hawkes-
bury and Wianamatta beds, which I would consider Upper Tnassic (although
the plants by themselves would justify to consider these beds as the horizon
of the Khaetic between Keuper and Lias). These are all I could determine
or get information of.?
Jurassic or Highest Beds.? Dr. Eeistmantel writes ? There u one
point not quite clear to me, if that Glossopteris which Professor M Coy
% Prodomus") and Mr. B. Smyth O'Report of Progress'?) mention as occurring
in one specimen together with Pecopteris Australis, Morr., from Tasmania,
belongs also to this group of strata.?
General Remarks. ?Dr. Feistmantel remarks, with reference to India, It
always results more and more that our Coal-bearing strata are only ? plant-
bearing ? ; no Marine fossils are here. Always more evidence is procured tor
Triassic age of the Coal Measures, and there is no other evidence for the view
of their probably Upper Palaeozoic age than the generical affinity of some
plants, as Vertebraria, Phyllotheca, and Glossopteris, with the Newcastle beds,
and partly in some of your Lower beds. As I have once before mentioned,
you may have every reason for an ? Upper Palaeozoic ? age of your Newcastle
beds, but there is nothing of this sort in our Indian Coal-seams.
? As I mentioned also before, our Indian Coal Measures are underlaid by
the so called Talchfr group, and another group of Coal-seams which I dis-
covered and proved in two Coal-basins (in Kurhurbali, in Bengal, and Mohpani,
in the Sutpura Basin), which are characterised by the preponderance of Gango
mopteris, by the absence (orrareness) of Vertebraria, by the rareness of Glossop-
teris, which reminds strongly of the Bacchus Marsh sandstones. If it would
be proved that the Bacchus Marsh sandstones are on the horizon of your
Newcastle beds or the termination of them, then our Coal flora of India would


appear as a third repetition of that in Australia (taking the Talchir group as
representative of the Bacchus Marsh sandstones, I mean, it would be so) ;

compare always with the Indian
formations his intended description of some of the Australian?fossils ; ;[and he
says, ? it will be seen that the Australian Newcastle beds and the Indian
Damudas are not to be confounded.?
With reference to the list now published, he says? ? I send you to-day again
the lists of the plants, Ac., based on your first collection [forwarded to Cal-
cutta], and on the quotations by other authors, as I have put it down in my
manuscript (it may be, that in your collections, now expected, will be some
other forms, which I shall communicate hereafter).?
? The ? Systematic Table ? includes those species only t. which' I - could
determine from your first collection, and which were described before by others,
but there is every probability that in your recent collections there will be
some other forms.?
? Of th e two boxes you recently sent me, I received only that entrusted to
Professor Liversidge. I found everything in order, and I am very much
obliged to you for your great kindness. The specimens of Lepidodendron which
were in that box as the L. nothum as from Groonoo Goonoo and from Queensland,
and the two small specimens from Smith?s Creek which you put in extra in an enve-
lope areof great importance. Theone (marked 154, Smith?s Creek, 1850) isagain
a Rhacopteris, and proves that my determination of the former specimens you
sent from Smith?s Creek and Port Stephens were correct, when I put them
down as Rhacopteris (comp.) incequilatera, Gopp; because this new specimen
with more split leaves is to the former one (from the same localities) in the
same relation as are certain forms in the Kohlenkalk and Culm of Silesia to
the real Rhacopteris incequilatera, Gopp. I have described these forms from
the Silesian Kohlenkalk with more split leaves as Sphenopteris ( Rhacopteris)
Romeri, Fstm. (1873, ? Ltschr. d. I), geol. Gesellsh.?) but more material proved
hereafter that these very possibly belong as certain developmental states to
Rhacopteris incequilatera, being connected with this later species by forms
which were described as Rhac. fiabellifera, Stur. (from the Culm flora).


? There would therefore be the following three forms
(1.) Rhacopteris incequilatera, Gopp.
(2.) ? dahellifera, Stur.
(3.) ? Romeri, Peistm.
Of these forms are present in your Lowest Coal-beds?at Smith?s Creek the
forms Nos. 1 and 3, and at Port Stephens No. 1.
? The other little specimen which you sent from Smith?s Creek looks very
like some forms which also occur in the Silesian Kohlenkalk, and which I
thought could belong to the genus Psilophyton or which possibly could perhaps
be the fructification of a fern. This will be determined hereafter, but so
much is certain that similar forms occur 111 the Lower Carboniferous.
[Since the foregoing has been in type, I have received a copy of a p a per
printed in the ? Records of the Oeol. Survey of India, No. 1878, entitled
? The Palceontological relations of the Gondivana System ; a Reply to Dr. -
mantel, by TV. 1\ Stanford, F.R.S., Deputy Superintendent, Oeol. Survey of
India.? ~I can now only refer my readers to this document, which continues
the discussion as to connection between the Indian and Australian Coai
formations to date. ?W.B.C.]
judged from their flora they are in dose connection with the strata
graphically (as determined by Mr. Clarke) tn y Vipforncercal fish (Urosthenes)
in column marked b, and as Mr. Clarke ms'sts P s there can be no objection to
showing evidence of a Palaeozoic age, Dr? after
consider these Newcastle beds as terminating the . * , *f r i ca m there being no
which only (he suggests) Olossopteru > spread out to India.and in India-
direct evidence for a Palaeozoic age of that epoch during , i.'rom the first he did not
on the contrary, all evidence being in favour of a Tnassic epoch From the
consider these beds younger than Tnassic, but always as Lowest 1 nas.
