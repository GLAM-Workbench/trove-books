A HISTORY OF GOLD
AS A COMMODITY AND AS A MEASURE OF VALUE.
?
CHAPTER I.
PRELIMINARY REMARKS.
Whenever any incident occurs that holds out the prospect of
immediate gain to the community, it is seldom, if ever, neglect-
ed ; and the rarer the incident, the more broadly it deviates
in its attendant circumstances from the ordinary course of
things, the more eagerly is it watched, and the greater amount
of excitement is it likely to create.
The recent discovery of gold in two distinct quarters of the
globe, and in more than ordinary abundance in each, is just
such an incident as we allude to, and is having precisely the
effect as might be predicated of it.
The circumstance of being able to pick up gold like common
dirt is, in itself, of so extraordinary a nature, so completely
opposed to all our experience, that its first announcement was
received with something like a doubting reservation, and had
it not been attested by a goodly array of facts, the public were
half-disposed to treat it rather as an airy unreality of romance
than one of the hard, naked, and practical doings of this mate-
rial world. Its truth, however, is placed beyond the reach of
controversy, and truth, under these conditions especially, is
entitled to the greatest deference, greater than we pay to mere
fiction.


Herera, the Spanish historian, relates that those who had
the good fortune to return from a voyage to the Indies, as Peru
and Mexico were then called, amazed their countrymen with
accounts of the gold which they found in those strange coun-
tries?of the rivers in whose rich beds the precious metal was
picked up in abundance?of the indifference of the Indians to
retain it?and of their willingness to exchange it for the merest
toys and trinkets. As the Spaniards listened to these tales,
says the historian, their eyes would brighten up, and their
mouths be kept agape, for the attendant circumstances were so
strange, so wondrous, and so really incredible; but when the
gold was spread out before them in glistening array ?in lumps,
flakes, and grains,?their feelings knew no bounds, and their
excitement could scarcely be repressed.
? When Columbus landed upon Hispaniola,? says another
authority,* ? the Indians gladly gave him their gold for
whistles, little knives, small looking-glasses, and other incon-
siderable trifles. They valued the precious metal no more than
dirt, as they exchanged slaves for commodities, having no
knowledge of any coin.?
These circumstances occurred some three hundred and fifty
years ago, when the thoughts of mankind, or at least their
actions, were limited to the comparatively narrow space of
Europe and the adjacent continents, for the new world had
then but just dawned upon the horizon of intelligence, so that
the means of reaching the ?gold-diggings? of that day must
have been exceedingly restricted, and only available to those
whom authority chanced to direct, or powerful private interest
to patronize. A voyage to the West Indies must then have
been a rare event in an individual?s life, and confined to a
certain privileged few ; ? for the great ships,? says Herera,
? only went to sea once a-year, and always sailed out of the
port of Seville, where a vast multitude of people saw them
depart, many thinking never to see them again.?
A bold and reckless Hidalgo, for instance, who wished per-
chance to repair his shattered fortune, accompanied with a few
followers in a similar condition; some soldiers, drafted from

different quarters, either by special favour, or deserving of
punishment, hut mostly the latter; a picked crew of Genoese
sailors, the most expert seamen of that day; and a Catholic
priest or so by way of salting up the whole, were the ordinary
concomitants of the adventurous crews who first visited the
new world in search of its tempting treasures; and if any of
these daring voyagers had the good fortune to return, if they
escaped the dangers of the sea, from their ignorance of naviga-
tion, the fierce encounters of the Indians, and the rough hand
and sharp eye of the pirate on their homeward voyage, they
were naturally considered as the rarce aves of the nation, and
treated with the respect which was due to their noble daring.
Under these circumstances it is clear that the few, the circum-
scribed few, could alone embrace the opportunity of gathering
the rich treasures which the course of events had so temptingly
spread out; and however intense may have been the excite-
ment on its becoming publicly known, the intensity was con-
fined to a comparatively narrow range, for the people at large
knew little about the treasures, and cared still less, seeing that
they had no chance of obtaining even a portion of it. More-
over, it is not in the nature of things that mankind should sigh
after objects which they never could hope to obtain, or waste
their energies upon that which is clearly beyond their reach.
Like the fox in the fable, the mass of the people are disposed
to cry ? sour, sour,? whenever the grapes are hung too high,
and endeavour to forget them as quickly as possible.
The hulk of the Spaniards, therefore, of the sixteenth cen-
tury, had but few opportunities of availing themselves of the
rich treasures of the newly-discovered world, and could only
participate in the crumbs, as it were, which fell from the lucky
adventurer?s table. These adventurers, however, expended
their easily-acquired wealth with singular, and, in some
instances, with senseless prodigality, so that the mere circum-
stance of supplying their ordinary wants, not to mention their
pleasures and pastimes, must have diffused a considerable portion
of that wealth amongst the mass of the people. The old adage
holds good even in this instance, ? easy comes, easy goes;? and
if we may credit certain historical statements as to the effect


which this sudden influx of wealth had upon the general con-
dition of the people, and upon the interest of the nation at large
?if we may rely upon what is commonly called the philosophy
of history, or rather upon the practical deductions which the
science of political economy enables us to draw at the present
day?it is extremely doubtful whether it was beneficial or
not. But we must reserve this point for another place.
The recent, and, if so it may be termed, second discovery of
the precious metals in great abundance, has one or two features
in common with those which were presented by the first,
although the broad and general phenomena of the latter are
essentially different. We have, for example, the unchanging
character of the semi-savage native, with his utter disregard of
that which his more advanced and more civilized brother so
dearly prizes; and we have, likewise, the precious metals
occuring in great abundance, and in precisely the same condi-
tions, so at least it may be practically inferred. These are two
important facts which observation and the light of science have
clearly established. We have, moreover, the daring, the spirit
of enterprise, the adventurous courage, and, we must add, the
reckless disregard of human life, which characterized the bold
discoverers of the sixteenth century. Here, however, the
parallel ceases, and, as we continue the lines of comparison, the
divergence from the equidistant becomes greater and greater,
until there is no possible connection between them. For in-
stance, the Dons and Hidalgos of this age are scarcely seen
upon the stage; and the picked soldiers and the choice crews ;
the priests and the royal patents ; the archbishops and bishops
sprinkling holy water upon the vessels, and bestowing their
blessings upon the captains and crews ; kings, princes, and
nobles ; cavaliers and fair ladies of the highest rank and birth,
with a phalanx of supporters; besides a multitude of spectators
to look in wonder at the exclusive few who boldly ventured to
the ? diggings ?of that day?where are all these ? The reader
of this little work must endeavour to answer the question.
But what have we instead of this showy array ? Look
at the picture as it really exists; there is no difficulty in dis-
cerning its composition. Take the first compartment of the


tableau. On the banks of the Sacramento, at the western base
of the Sierra Nevada, you may perceive a strange and motley
group, a mixture of all nations, and speaking all tongues, yet
all animated with one desire?the search for gold ?which they
pursue with the utmost avidity. The love of gain, the master
passion of the human heart, has drawn that heterogeneous
assemblage there, and what they earn they will enjoy, each
according to his desires, and uncontrolled by the dictation of
his neighbour, apart from robbery and murder, which, by the
hypothesis, are excluded from the comparison. Instead of being
led by some noble and needy adventurer, as of old, who
? Here and there,

For food and diet, to an enterprise
That had a stomach in?t,?
the gold-hunters of California have gone there of their own
accord, and have braved all these dangers to accomplish their
own ends. Over seas and over continents, through morasses
and deserts, traversing the highest mountains, and fording the
most dangerous and rapid rivers?they have endured all this,
and would endure it again for the same purpose. They may he,
for aught we know, the ? landless resolutes? of all the world,
hut it is clear that they have been ? shark?d up? to their present
? enterprise? by their own free-will, ?by the demon of avarice,
if you like, or, as Virgil somewhat gloomily puts it, by the
? Auri sacra fames
yet the mortalia pectora of these diggers are not the only
tabernacles in which the ? accursed thirst for gold? has taken
up its exclusive abode. Be this as it may, the great fact stands
out in bold relief that these adventurous miners are free agents,
that their bodies and souls are not at the beck and nod of a
comparatively selfish and domineering few, ?which constitutes
the difference of feature between the majority of those who
picked up gold in the sixteenth century, and those who are
picking it up at the present time. And this fact suggests
many others, which are well deserving of a remark or so.
Instead of ships sailing out of port, with great pomp and


ceremony, once or twice in a year, and from a single place, we
have them in almost countless numbers from every quarter of
the globe, and sailing to and fro their thousands of miles as
uninterruptedly as the stately barges of Seville were wont
formerly to sail down the smooth waters of the Guadal-
quiver. The term ? danger? even is nearly obliterated from
the vocabulary of navigation, and has little beyond an econo-
mical meaning, for the intelligence of man has enabled him as
it were to ? grasp the ocean in his span,? or, to speak in more
sober and befitting phrase, has taught him how to reduce the
highways across the Atlantic and Pacific to the simple condi-
tion of a turn-pike road. And this multitude of ships, the
shadow of whose sails darkens every water, is another feature
which distinguishes the gold epoch of this age from that of the
sixteenth century, for thousands now can be transported to
scenes and localities where their labour may be made available,
and their industry exercised, for their own advantage, and for
the creation of an honest and healthy independence, while units
before had scarcely the same chance. The fitting out of a
single ship in these days, the whole cost of her structure,
will scarcely amount to as much as an embroidered velvet
mantle of a sixteenth-century Hidalgo, nor near so much as
many of the latter were in the habit of squandering on the
Plaza di Toro at a single bull-fight. Then there is the wealth,
the comparatively useless wealth, of the grandees of Spain,
which was principally drawn from the rich mines of the Indies
?how was that employed ? ? Upon the death of the Hue
d?Albuquerque,? says Bassompierre,* ? it took six weeks to
complete the schedule of his vessels of gold and silver, working
two hours each day. There were 1400 dozen of gold plates and
dishes, and forty steps of solid silver to serve as ladders, by
which he could ascend to the top of his lofty buffets. When
they told me of this opulence I thought they were quizzing
me, but when I inquired of Don Antonio de Toledo, son of the
Due d?Albe, he assured me it was true, and that his father, who
did not consider himself rich in plate, had six hundred dozen
of dishes of gold, and eight hundred of silver.? A single

service of such valuable plate would more than defray the cost
of the fleet of merchant ships which are almost weekly trans-
porting emigrants to the modern gold-diggings; it would even
secure a free passage for the thousands who are crowding their
decks, and send them merrily onwards to their destination,
whither the hope of gain and the love of independence have
temptingly allured them.
We simply cite these circumstances to point the moral and
industrial features which distinguish these times in contradis-
tinction to those we have drawn attention to, and not from a
desire to indulge in any disparagement of social distinctions,
for which we are somewhat ardent sticklers. The few who had
the means of acquiring wealth in the sixteenth century, doubt-
less acted upon the same conscientious principles as those who
acquire wealth in the present day, but in the use of that wealth
?in its application to reproductive purposes ?they were much
behind the present age. This is the feature we are desirous of
pointing out, and an important feature it is to the toiling mil-
lion, who are by no means slow to discern its advantage.
Let us now examine another compartment of the picture,
and, all things considered, the most interesting of the two.
Just transport yourself, reader, from the foot of the Sierra
Nevada to that of the Blue Mountains, from the banks of the
Sacramento to that of the Macquarrie, and you will perceive
a similar scene of activity. Granite rocks, boulders, water-
courses, creeks, sand, dry diggings and wet, cradles and washers
of all sorts, with a multitude of beings, intently as those of
California, in search of the precious metal. At the first blush
the Australian group will appear as like that of California as
one swarm of bees is like another, or as one rope of onions
resembles its fellow; nevertheless, upon closer examination,
you will soon perceive a difference, which is well worth noting.
Here you have more quietude amongst the diggers,?indicative
of a higher social discipline than you can observe in the
Californian group,? and a marked absence of the predomi-
nant feature of the latter, that reckless, rollicking, devil-
may-care, desperado character, yet withal spirited, bold, and
picturesque, but with a dash too deep of truly callous wicked-


ness. There are, probably, as many noisy, drinking, tear-
throats among the Australian diggers as elsewhere, but you
cannot meet with that Mephistopheles-mixture of man and
fiend, that blazed piece of humanity whom the vices of the
world have sear-hardened, who can put on the guise of honesty
with the most deceptive ease, or throw it aside if aping its
opposite quality will better answer his end; in short, that con-
centration of self which is ever ready either to caress or to
crush its victim, according to the balance of advantages. There
certainly is an absence of that interesting colouring in the
Australian portion of the tableau when compared to that of the
Californian.
? But these Australian diggers,? you will say, ?have no
such excuse as those of California could make; they neglect
the treasure which lies, as it were, immediately beneath their
feet, to hunt after that which tempts the eye at a distance. It
is the old story of the tortoise and the hare, only told in another
form. The steady going pace of the tortoise ultimately beat
the more rapid but non-sustaining movements of the hare.
Here you have repeated the craving desire of the many to
gratify their wishes without the necessity of labouring for the
means, or, in other terms, the hop-step-and-jump-process of
procuring a competence, in contradistinction to the old-fashioned
and healthy-toned habit of acquiring it by steadily-directed
industry.? Granted. But the avidity to obtain gold at once
and directly, in preference to acquire it indirectly by industrial
pursuits, is no new feature, nor is it exclusively confined to any
one class of men. It has been a common error in all ages to
regard the representative of the value of things as more im-
portant than the things themselves, and consequently to prefer
the producing of gold and silver to all others. Hence the
avidity for gold-digging and gold-mining; here that profit
seems to be made at once which in other cases can only be
hoped to be made after repeated industrial operations. Here
seems to be opened at a single effort the sources of wealth,
and it is natural in the present state of mind of the masses
that such principles should obtain.
With every disadvantage, however, which can possibly be


enumerated of the gold discoveries of California and Australia,
it is fair to assume that a balance of good will result from them.
These discoveries have imparted to the public mind the precise
impulse that was required. There w r as a congestion of popula-
tion in more than one quarter of the globe that stood greatly
in need of dispersion, ere the general body could enjoy a
healthful exercise of its functions. To he choked up in
masses here, ?to be thinly scattered there. Empty mouths and
idle hands in this quarter of the globe,?a scarcity of hands and
ample means to employ them, in order that those mouths might
no longer remain empty, existing elsew'here. These dispropor-
tionate relations required adjusting, and the adjustment is
about to take place, which must tend greatly to augment the
interest and happiness of all. This, doubtless, is a step in the
right direction; another link added to the great chain of pro-
gress, which all of us desire to see lengthened, however di-
versely our efforts may be directed to that purpose.
In these two communities, therefore, may be contemplated
the nuclei of other great and rising sections of mankind, which,
in the progress of time, wall fulfill their destiny equally with
those who have preceded them. The wmrld never dies; but
how its existence is perpetuated is beyond?far beyond?our
limited capacity to comprehend. Nor shall we venture to
intrude upon the domain of speculation, either as regards the
mysterious agency of Providence in human affairs. * * *

chain whose links are destined to hold mankind in peaceful
relation to each other?to make them as one family, as one
race, among wdiom the fruits of industry shall attain their
healthiest growth, and the enlightenment of mind its most
radiant hue. This simple incident may prove the turning-
point in the destiny of mankind. There w r ere many difficulties
in the way of human progress, ere the event to which w r e allude
occurred, which sorely puzzled the brains of men, and which,
to all appearance, w r ere really insurmountable. There was the


Isthmus of Panama, for example, to cut through, which all
knew would prove highly advantageous as a means of commu-
nication with the great world in the east, if once effected; and
there was, likewise, the supply of labour to Australia, which
presented such peculiar and anomalous features to the mother
country, although the most thriving and wealthy of all her
colonies.
We point to these two prominent difficulties, as many others
hinged upon them; and how have we grappled with them ?
There has been no end of treasure wasted in search of a north-
west passage, which, if discovered, would be of little comparative
use for mercantile navigation; and, in making the search, we
have probably doomed a body of brave and devoted adventurers
to destruction, whose best energies, like those of many others,
have been exerted to little or no purpose. As regards, however,
the supply of labour to Australia, even the omnipotent power of
Parliament proved itself inadequate to that task, although it
had the exciting impulse of well-filled unions, saucy paupers,
highly-swollen poor-rates, peddling parochial politicians, and
the high priests of political economy to urge it on, and to indi-
cate the path it ought to take. Still, Parliament was power-
less, if not paralyzed, and at length betrayed the usual symp-
toms of impotency.
We shall now conclude our preliminary observations, and
state a little more in detail the immediate aim of this little

CHAPTER 11.
THE CONDITION OF GOLD IN ITS NATURAL STATE.
Gold in its natural state is almost uniformly found under
the same conditions. The researches of geology, in different
quarters of the globe, have clearly established this fact. There
is scarcely a difference of opinion amongst those who may be
termed the lights of the science, and their views may be con-
veyed, with scarcely an exception, in the following formula:?
Gold, when traced to its original matrix, is found to occur
chiefly in veins of quartz, in the form of lumps, threads, and
flakes, or in grains mixed with sand in rivers. These veins are
found in what geologists term the metamorphic series of rocks,
which comprise granite, under certain conditions, porphyry,
serpentine, gneiss, mica-schist, and other eruptive formations.
? Experience,? says a great authority,* ? has shown that it is
in the primary group only, including certain igneous rocks
which are associated with it, that gold ore has ever been found
in any large quantities?in quantities worthy of being worked.
Wherever clay slates, old limestones, and greywacke sand-
stones, have been penetrated by greenstone, porphyry, syenite,
granite, or serpentine, and were consequently in a more or less
metamorphic or crystalline condition, these auriferous quartz-
ore vein-stones must occur, containing gold ore diffused in
grains, leaves, lumps, and irregular filaments. Every dis-
covery in the auriferous regions of Siberia and America, as
well as the workings in the old world iii past times, confirm
this view, and prove it to be a geological constant, that the
azoic and palseozoic rocks, when metamorphosed, are the only
great repositories of gold ore.? If an objection can be raised
? Murchison.


against this able description of gold in its natural state, it is
that of being somewhat too general, which we shall endeavour
to show in the course of our remarks, premising that we ven-
ture to do so with extreme caution, and from a conviction that
our observations will he received by its distinguished author
in a proper light.
Another peculiarity of the condition of gold is also pointed
out by the same authority, and is deserving of especial notice.
? These veins are described as rising from beneath, because
they are seen to cut through all the strata or beds of which the
hills have been originally composed. Whether these great
traversing vein-stones have had their metalliferous ores sub-
limed into them from beneath by heat, or agglomerated by
galvanic action and slower processes (possibly by both), it is to
the ascertained facts only that we now advert, and we do so in
order that the reader should comprehend how the distribution
of gold, in its original vein-stone or parent rock, differs from
that of every other metal in the minute diffusion of its threads
and particles, and their superficial range. Lodes of iron, cop-
per, and argentiferous lead ores, when followed downwards,
have in countless cases been found to become more and more
productive; whilst gold has invariably proved to he much
attenuated downwards, and in most instances to disappear in
the veins at any considerable depth. An attention to this
mining fact at once explains why the greatest quantities of
gold-dust, and the largest lumps of gold should be constantly
found in rubbish, gravel, sand, or clayey beds, which have
resulted from the wearing down of those rocks, in the upper
parts of which most of the gold was accumulated.?*
The circumstance of gold being found in the beds of rivers,
both in ancient and modern times, in much greater abundance
than in natural veins, is fully accounted for in the preceding
remarks. The more immediate cause, however, of the precious
metal being thus separated, or disintegrated from the parent
rock, is deserving of still further explanation. All rocks are
more or less dissolved, or disintegrated, when within reach of
the oxygen and carbonic acid of the atmosphere, and water

aided by beat. Some, it is true, appear to be nearly indestruc-
tible, and are practically so when kept dry, as appears from the
integrity of certain sienites in the dry climate of Egypt, of
which some ancient monuments still exist; but even these
would suffer, if they were slightly covered with earth, and kept
wet. Most of the rocks in the great mountain ranges are of the
easily destructible kind, and it is mainly owing to this fact
that ravines of denudation are so numerous on their flanks.
Although quartz, in which gold is principally embedded, is not
so liable to be acted upon by atmospheric agents as other rocks,
which accounts for its projecting out in relief, or lying in
masses over or below the outcrop of the vein, if it be on an in-
clined surface, still its disintegration is certain, and the tena-
city of its component parts is gradually overcome. But as slate
rocks appear to prevail in all gold-producing districts, and as
the veins of quartz sometimes permeate the slates, which are
among those most readily acted upon by the atmosphere, the
gold is quickly released from its matrix. Even in summer
these slates are undergoing almost continuous exfoliation,
which soon reduces them to the minutest fragments, but in
winter, when exposed to alternate frost and rain, their trans-
formation is extremely rapid. Trap, porphyry, and other
igneous rocks, with which quartz is frequently connected, also
undergo a similar change, by the simple effect of the atmo-
sphere. But the heavy rains, which periodically sweep down
the mountain sides, have the greatest effect in producing the
disintegration of these rocks. Hence the great area of diluvial
drifts, the enormous boulders, the deep ravines, and the extra-
ordinary denudations, which, more or less, are observable on
the sides and in the valleys of all great mountain ranges.
During these heavy rains the large boulders are driven furi-
ously along the ravines, and lodged wherever the lessened
velocity will permit them to remain; and the gold imbedded
in the veins of the quartz becomes disintegrated, and, by its
specific gravity, remains principally in the bottoms of the
ravines. As these currents decrease in force, the heavier stony
fragments are deposited, and in many instances cover the auri-
ferous and other metallic substances; but the gravel and sand,


from their comparative lightness, sweep on and form the immense
beds which are now seen at the base of the mountains, and the
large deposits in the valleys.
It is, therefore, to the great alluvion, which consists of
earth, sand, stones, gravel, and other matter, loosened from the
rocks by atmospheric disintegration, and swept down by the
heavy rains, that we must look for the largest supplies of gold.
The great convulsions, also, which periodically occur in the
mountain ranges, sometimes break down their sides, and
deposit vast heaps of detritus with their mineral impregnations
in the valleys immediately adjacent, and when the rivers flow
through these deposits, the earthy portions are carried away,
while the heavier, or metalliferous, either sink to the bottom or
are scattered hither and thither, according to their specific
gravity. Hence a lump of gold is occasionally found in a side
creek, or in the bend of a river, just as accident, or its resisting
weight, may determine, but generally far away from its parent
rock. Rut the general condition of gold is in small particles;
when found in these great drifts, and in a river of any length
it is generally deposited much above its estuary. In several
cases, where the upper sand of the river-bed shows no appear-
ance of gold, it may be found in abundance below, especially
where the coating of sand is thick, or the washing of the flood
is deep. The deeper the gulley, in fact, the greater the chance
of a deposit. The same cause which confines the gold deposits
to the water-course, also accumulates it on certain spots. Every
natural bar, for instance, which arrests the water, must like-
wise arrest the gold, and the latter will he generally found
there, or just above it, in more than ordinary abundance. The
mountain freshes will occasionally sweep the precious metals
from these beds, and spread it over a wider surface ; sometimes
it will be found heaped together against a ledge of rocks, or
scattered in thinner quantities along the banks of a stream, if
the latter happens to be a little sluggish in its course. Occa-
sionally it may be met with at the roots of certain tufts grow-
ing by the sides of the rocks, or on the bed of a rock, or
mingled with the gravel at the limit to which the action of the
river flows, or freshets reach ; but, wherever met with, the


precious metal is invariably in the same condition, viz., in dust,
scales, or lumps, and appears as though it had just escaped
from its matrix.
There is, however, an observable difference between the old
and new deposits. In the former the gold is seldom found in
the purest water-courses, which occasions the difference be-
tween what are called the ? dry? and ? wet? diggings in the
recently discovered deposits. The dry diggings are in the old
drift on the more elevated banks, while the wet are in the beds
of the rivers; yet it is difficult to preserve the distinction, for
what are called the ? wet? diggings, in many instances, include
both the old and new deposits. On the discovery of a deposit
in a given part of the river, it must not be inferred that gold
will be found along its whole course; the deposit depends upon
so many circumstances; but it is generally found near the base
of the mountains whence the metal has been disintegrated.
The bulk of the gold will naturally be deposited at each fall or
weir of the river, and when the water reaches the low and flat
lands, a few miles of its sluggish flow will thoroughly sift from
the precious metal all the detritus brought down from above.
We have not space to enter upon the disputable points con-
nected with the origin of gold, however we might be disposed
to mingle in the fray, and, therefore, shall content ourselves
with giving a simple summary of the differences which exist,
amongst the leading authorities, on this important question.
We have, however, a notion?we cannot dignify it with the
appellation of a theory, and it scarcely deserves that of an
hypothesis?of our own, to which we alluded at the outset of
this chapter, and if it do not lead to the establishment of any
point itself, it may probably furnish a scintillation to others,
who are in the pursuit of geological truths. But of this anon.
The geological surveys however of the Californian range of
the Sierra Nevada, by the American Commissioners,* seem to
strengthen the opinion of Sir R. Murchison, that ? gold was
the last formed of the metals.? ? A very little attention to
geological science,? writes Sir Roderick, ? will have informed
the reader that, in the long preadamite periods of time during

which various successive races of animals passed away, each
epoch was accompanied by great accumulations of water-worn
and rolled pebbles. These pudding-stones, or conglomerates, are
of all ages, from the oldest to the youngest sedimentary deposits
which have been found under water. Now, the western flank
of the Ural is specially rich in grand, loose piles of stones, de-
rived from the very ancient adjacent rocks, some of which were
washed down into the former sea just at the close of the older
palaeozoic periods; others re-occur in a great system or group
of the younger palaeozoic strata to which I have assigned the
name of Permian, and which, being of the same age of the
magnesian limestone of England, are older than the secondary
rocks. The Permian conglomerates, formed when certain land-
plants and the first huge lizards appeared, but long before a
mammal was created, were clearly all composed of the rocks of
the Ural mountains, because every pebble in them has been de-
rived therefrom ; and with these pebbles we find also quantities
of iron and copper detritus, together with land-plants ?but no
gold. We therefore not only infer that these Ural mountains
were the lands in which the plants grew, and on the edges of
which the great aqueous lizards fed, whose remains we find in
these pudding-stones; but we also know from the debris that
copper and iron must have then existed in that chain. Nay,
further, the discovery of water-worn lumps of magnetic iron
ore in the copper deposits of the Ural mountains themselves,
has led to the belief that iron was the first formed of these two
metals in this region. What, then, was the metal which
followed them ? Seeing the depth at which silver occurs in
other regions (there is very little of it in the Ural), and how it
is associated with lead, we do not, in the absence of direct proof,
absolutely contend that it was formed after copper. In refer-
ence to gold, however, we believe that, together with platinum,
it was the last formed metal. At all events it is a legitimate
inference, that gold did not exist in those mountains when the
Permian deposit was formed upon the flank, seeing that not a
vestige of it is to he detected amid the copious detritus of
copper and iron ores in the conglomerate of that age.?*
? ?Quarterly Review,? 1850,


Sir Roderick further remarks that in the vast changes which
came over the surface of this planet, the result was the forma-
tion of much gravel, shingle, and sand, which, when occasion-
ally compacted, as in our own gravel of Kensington and
Hampstead, is the youngest of all the great conglomerates.
This is the only one of the whole series of geological conglo-
merates, according to this eminent authority, in which gold has
been found. In none previously formed, he remarks, has any
notable quantity been detected in any country; and that it is
in the superficial detritus, more or less similar, resulting from
the grinding down of the former tops of mountains, that what-
ever gold is worth collecting is invariably found, not only in
the Ural mountains, but all over the surface of the earth.
The eastern range of the Sierra Nevada presents certain
features which strongly support the deductions of Murchison.
There the usual phenomena of the Permian period present
themselves, which invariably denote the absence of gold.
?It is probable,? says Mr. Tyson (Mr. King writes in a
more positive manner) that diiferent systems occur on different
sides of the Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountains. Indeed the
numerous large volcanic peaks favour this presumption A
judiciously planned and efficiently executed survey may be ex-
pected to develop other classes of veins containing silver, copper,
and other metals; perhaps, also, the veins next the granite
axis of the Sierra may contain ores of tin.?
This view of the geological features of the eastern range of
the Sierra Nevada has been since confirmed. An able and
scientific observer * writes thus:?? It is remarkable that gold
has been found almost invariably on the western or Pacific side
of the great range, while silver, copper, and lead are discovered
on the eastern side, at a much higher elevation.?
Mr. Kingf is of opinion that gold exists in combination with
the veinstone, and is not simply disseminated therein :
? The gold, whether in detached particles and pieces, or in
veins, was created in combination with quartz.? . . . The

gold veins, and by constant attrition cut the gold into flakes and
dust.?
We agree with Mr. Tucker that attrition would wear, or
rub off, certain portions of gold into a state of powder or small
grains, but that it is difficult to conceive how a metal, having
the peculiar properties of gold, could be cut into flakes by the
means here indicated. As regards the veins, that will bring
us at once to the point at which we are desirous of arriving,
and we shall endeavour to show that Mr. King has taken a
somewhat cursory and erroneous view of the subject.
Whatever diversity of opinion there may be amongst geo-
logists upon the nature and origin of veins, there is a common
agreement among them upon these points,?that in all metalli-
ferous districts there are several systems of veins traversing the
same rocks, each system preserving the parallelism of its own
veins with singular regularity; and, secondly, that different
classes of veins have different contents, while the contents of the
same vein almost always vary in proportions when the vein
passes through a different kind of rock.
The means by which veins have been filled is altogether an
unsettled point in science. Veins usually are nearly perpendi-
cular ; it is rare to find them inclining as much as 45�. Each
system of veins in a district has its own direction or strike,
Those first formed are intercepted by the next, and so on suc-
cessively ; their relative ages being determined by these inter-
sections. * The subject of veins has been practically investigated
both in England and in Saxony; in Cornwall there are eight
distinct systems of veins, and in the Freyburg district of
Saxony they have the same number. If veins were filled, like
dikes, by the injection of matter in a state of fusion from below,
we should occasionally observe an overflow and deposit upon
the surface. There are several overflowings from dikes, but
none from veins. This objection is considered by many as fatal
to the theory of injection; others, probably of an equally
untenable nature, have been suggested. That of electric
agency, for example, has attracted considerable attention, since
Mr. Fox, after several experiments, succeeded informing well-

defined metalliferous veins by means of voltaic currents, under
circumstances supposed to exist naturally in Cornwall.* The
rents and fissures in rocks have probably been produced by
the same agency as earthquakes, and also by the contraction
of masses of heated rocks in cooling. These rents or veins
continue for great distances, passing through various strata
of the different kinds of rock in their course, and usually to
depths greater than the miner has yet reached, though the
earth has been mined to the depth of nearly 2000 feet. In
thickness they vary from an inch to several yards, the thick
veins sometimes dwindling to a mere thread, and again sud-
denly enlarging. The largest known vein in the world is that
near Guanaxato, in Mexico, f which varies in thickness from
twenty-five to fifty yards; and the next, we believe, is in
Derbyshire, which averages about twenty-three yards. The
Mexican mine, according to the high authority quoted, was
worked for silver to a depth of 1,080 feet, and for a distance of
six miles in a horizontal direction. In most cases, veins are
richer in metals in rocks of sedimentary origin than in those of
igneous formation; but when both classes of rocks are found in
combination, especially at the point of contact or juncture,
there is invariably a larger amount of metals and ores. The
minute veins, in most series of rocks, are more or less simple
in their composition ; they frequently consist of a single mine-
ral, the nature of which generally bears some relation to the
constitution of the containing rocks.J Thus, quartz-veins are
found in all rocks, since all rocks abound more or less in silica;
but they are most frequent in rocks where the latter predomi-
nates. Calcareous veins indicate lime as the composition of the
rock, and the magnesian minerals, such as asbestos, steatite, &c.,
? Almost all our leading geologists seem to have eschewed the important
subject of veins. Neither Murchison, Buckland, nor De la Beche, have done
more than simply allude to them. Nor has Professor Ansted, in his highly-
interesting little volume, ?The Gold-Seeker?s Manual,? stepped beyond the
limits of a mere allusion to them, although so appropriate an opportunity pre-
sented itself, while describing the nature and condition of gold in different parts
of the world. The ablest treatise we have met with, apart from the contribu-
tions of Mr. Came in the Geological Transactions of Cornwall, on the subject of
veins, is the Treatise on Primary Geology by Mr. Boase.

characterize the serpentines. The granitic and schistose rocks
are also distinguished in their series by the peculiar mineral
which happens to predominate; thus hornblende, chlorite>
schist, or mica, may be traced in patches wherever they sepa-
rately prevail. Sometimes, however, the substance of these
veins is compound, exhibiting distinct crystalline mixtures of
two or more minerals, which is deserving of particular atten-
tion, as the largest quantities of gold are found in veins of this
kind. The quartz, or matrix of these veins, is frequently
crystallized in the central parts, so as to form drusy cavities,
or elongated openings, which are usually lined with the mine-
rals. Here, also, is a receptacle for gold; and when these
veins exhibit small, well-defined, rounded grains of quartz,
which are sometimes of a different colour from that of the
base, in connection with rounded and angular grains of felspar
and scales of mica, gold is almost sure to be present. But
when chlorite and talc, which occasionally pass by insensible
gradations into each other, and in this state supply the place of
mica, are found in gneiss formations, there the precious metal
is frequently found in the greatest abundance.
These several indications are deserving of attention, as they
will save a great deal of labour in the search for gold, it being
too frequently taken for granted that if the precious metal he
found in one portion of the mountain range, or series of rocks,
it may be found in the whole. This notion is commonly enter-
tained ; but experience, and the further investigations of science,
will prove it to be quite erroneous. We have before us, while
we write, two separate pieces of the Australian rock; and
where they were broken from the parent rock, gold has been
found in considerable quantities. The component parts of
these pieces are nearly similar; but the one that contains the
usual indices of gold has precisely the formation described
above, while the other is essentially different, although sepa-
rated from the rock within fifty yards of the former. Yet
both would answer to the description given by Sir K. Murchi-
son of the formation indicative of the presence of gold, quoted
at the commencement of this chapter, and which induced us to
remark that that description was of too general a character.


The particulars which we have ventured to point out will lead,
we hope, to further enquiry, and to a consequent economical
advantage, which has not hitherto obtained.
The origin of gold deserves a passing remark or so, were it
simply to register the postulata of the leading lights of geology.
One writer,* of no mean capacity, has hammered out the grain
of metal which emanated from the rich ore of Buckland?s mind
in the following manner :
? By what process or operation of nature came these seams,
or veins of gold, to be deposited ? Was it the agency of fire, or
by water and alluvium ? I think it probable that both may
have been at work, being the two greatest solvents in nature,
and at the same time the greatest crystalizers : perhaps metal-
lic ore may be the work of alluvium, and the production of
pure metallic substances that of heat. With respect to gold, I
think the latter theory is more reasonable, as it is always found
in a pure state; whilst the quartz (pure silex) in which it is
contained may be alluvial, and one of the earliest deposits, from
the decomposition of the original unstratified mass. But where
shall we seek for the original supply of the precious metal ?
How is it found, or whence has it been extracted by the agency
of heat ? It is not enough to say that, like other metals, it is
found diffused through all nature ; for an appreciable quantity
of gold has been extracted from violets. In my opinion it
exists in the original unstratified mass, in imperceptible pro-
portions, but proportions varying in different places, other
metals being more or less abundant. The greater proportion of
our soils are formed, according to Sir H. Davy, by decomposi-
tion of the original mass, and this accounts for the diffusion of
gold in small particles, which may be taken up by plants, and
enter into the composition of organized bodies. If, then, the
unstratifled rock is the original seat of the metal, but in particles
infinitely minute, it may have been separated by a very high
degree of heat, by which it would be sublimated, or volatilized,
and thus carried upward by chemico-electric force, and by a
process resembling distillation. In this way it would penetrate
the quartz rock, or be condensed in the spaces of the laminated
+ Brackenridge.


strata, such as talc-schist or mica-slate. Such is the theory of
Buckland and other modern geologists. It may be mere specu-
lation ; but one thing is certain, as may be seen at once by
those who have examined the larger masses of gold brought
from California, that the finer particles of gold have been run
together by a second operation of heat, sufficient only to fuse
them and separate them from the quartz. The first was distil-
lation, the second smelting, or rather simple fusion. It is
possible that these great operations of nature have been repeated
at different intervals, and different seams of quartz and gold
may be found in ascending the ravines, the lower more com-
pletely scattered through, but in finer particles, and the higher
having undergone afterwards simple fusion.?
Another has put forth an hypothesis of a different nature.
We quote the able report of Mr. Tyson ? A writer has sug-
gested the gold to have been ejected from volcanoes, and
scattered far and wide over the country.? This suggestion
may be dismissed with very few remarks, as all testimony is
against it. There are about three hundred volcanoes, now known
to be what is called ? active,? and a far greater number extinct;
and it has not yet been observed that gold is among their pro-
ducts. ? Now,? says the Report, ? between the Yuba and
American rivers, a distance of more than seventy miles, wherein
so much gold has been obtained, there is a total absence of all
such volcanic fragments. The greatest horizontal distance
that any fragment has been known to have been thrown from
a volcano does not exceed nine miles.? This, we apprehend, is
proof sufficient of the instability of the argument.
In our next chapter we shall show how gold is produced,
whether by washing or mining. Humboldt remarks that the
richest gold deposits are those which are derived from ridges
having a meridian direction, Erman opposed this. Murchison
is of opinion that a much greater quantity has been obtained
from chains having a nearer relation to north and south than
from those approaching to equatorial, or east and west direc-
tions, due, perhaps, to the general form of the chief masses of
land, and the prevailing strike of the paleeosoic rocks. Yet the
great gold-bearing chain of Africa has an east and west direc-


tion, and seems as highly auriferous as any yet developed, and
indeed much more highly, for it has been the principal supply
for some thousands of years, and is still worked for the precious
metal. As experience, however, widens the basis of generali-
zation, these opinions will doubtless undergo a corresponding
modification.
? ?
CHAPTER 111,
THE METHOD OF OBTAINING GOLD, AND ITS GENERAL
DISTRIBUTION.
All investigation has hitherto shown that gold is by no
means partially disseminated throughout the globe, but that it
is extremely limited in quantity. The rich yield of California,
of Australia, and we may add of the Ural Chain, though in
apparent contradiction to our postulate, will, on examination,
furnish the strongest proof in its favour, The metal is found
in these auriferous regions as elsewhere, namely, in extremely
small particles, seldom in its parent rock, and, when traced
home to its source, in so pure and compact a state, that each
piece indicates, at once, that it originally received a distinct
and isolated formation. We shall not venture upon the un-
trodden ground of science, but simply keep in the path which
those of holder step than ourselves have marked out, and rest
content with the ordinary facts which observation and research
have thrown in our way. If diamonds were found as large as
hen?s eggs, and rubies and emeralds the size of an ordinary
potato, we might have some doubt as to the precise natural
condition of gold; but, as practical experience shows that the
diamond is produced in the same form and substance, however
slightly it may vary in purity,?which does not effect the pro-
position,?whether excavated from the mine of Golconda, or from
that of Brazil, it is fair to presume that gold is subject to the
same conditions. Nature works by great general laws, which
produce similar results throughout the globe. Copper ores


have the same broad features of resemblance, whether exca-
vated from the bowels of the earth at Cuba or at Adelaide,
although the distance between these places is measured by
some thousands of miles; and a lump of coal cropping out, or
dipping in its native bed, is the very counterpart of the same
mineral, whether mined in the County of Durham or in Van-
couver?s Island.
The gold deposits, therefore, of California and New South
Wales, are precisely analogous to those of the Ural Chain,
which have everything in common with other auriferous re-
gions, both as to the quantity produced, the quality of the
metal, and the peculiar conditions under which it is found.
History furnishes us with a clear and strong light to direct
our inquiry on this head. There is scarcely a chapter in the
Old Testament but bears testimony to the abundance of gold
in remote ages, and that it was equally cherished, and as eagerly
sought after, as at the present day; but it cannot fail to strike
the reflecting mind that the high value put upon the precious
metal implied its comparative scarcity, and the great difficulty
of obtaining it, otherwise we should not perpetually see gold
placed in the fore-ground whenever the riches, the power, or
the earthly grandeur of kings and princes are so studiously
catalogued. We know, also, from collateral testimony, which
we shall shortly adduce, that the great bulk of the gold men-
tioned in sacred and profane writings was gathered precisely
in the same way as at the present day, namely, in the beds and
sands of rivers, and that little of it was the produce of mining
operations. We have also abundant proof that gold was one
of the great articles of commerce, long before it was adopted
as a standard of value amongst certain people, and was held
in high estimation by those especially who lived in large cities,
and were engaged in trading affairs. We, therefore, find it
naturally flowing towards the great centres of communication,
and gladly taken in exchange for the choicest productions and
the most highly valued commodities. The gold-dust of Africa
found its way throughout the whole of Asia, and ultimately
became the leading commodity in the great marts of early
Europe. Now, had nature produced gold as abundantly as


other metals it would soon have been discovered, and a larger
quantity brought to market, which must have materially affected
its value; but, as it seems as eagerly sought after now as it
was four thousand years ago, and still maintains its relative
value, it is reasonable to assume that the quantity of gold is
but limited, and that nature has been at all times extremely
chary in its production. But it may be said that the quantity
of the precious metal found in the three great modern deposits,
if we may be allowed such a term, would seem to imply that
nature does not always work uniformly in her laboratory, but
that, on the contrary, she occasionally indulges in partial
freaks, and in ununiform profusion. A superficial view may,
perhaps, lead to such a conclusion ; but if we only enlarge the
circle of our observation, so as to embrace the great general
operations of nature, we shall be led to a very different con-
clusion.
The production of gold is a result apparently depending, as
regards quantity, upon simple accident. Observation has
proved that gold is produced by certain elemental changes,
which periodically take place in the internal part of the
globe, and whether it be of aqueous or igneous origin, or
perhaps of both, its quantity is mainly determined by the
nature and amount of the forces in activity. Now, whenever
the old formations have been highly metamorphosed by the
intrusion of igneous rocks, in certain mountain ranges, or, in
other terms, whenever clay-slates, old lime-stones, and grey-
wacke sand-stones have been penetrated by green-stone, por-
phyry, sienite, granite or serpentine, and consequently in a
more or less metamorphic condition, the gold naturally occurs
in larger quantity than elsewhere. To affirm, therefore, that
nature occasionally produces gold in abundance, and vice versa,
is simply to affirm that elements of a certain magnitude and
power will produce a greater result than those which are pro-
portionately less : in short, to assert a simple truism.
But there is this peculiarity in connection with gold being
produced in abundance, ?that nature herself on those occasions
invariably turns miner, and spreads open to the eyes of man this
precious treasure; whereas, in most of her inferior productions,


he must labour hard and dig deep, ere he can become possessed
of them. Whether this he a simple result or not, does not so
plainly appear. It is true that the component parts of the
eruptive rocks, in which gold is imbedded, are subject to very
great superficial atmospheric changes; and, as the precious
metal lies on, or near, the surface of its natural bed, it is soon
subjected to those atmospheric influences, which quickly pro-
duce external changes. A few torrents, or so, rushing vehe-
mently down the mountain side, in which it is superficially
buried, hurls it here and there, until it happens to become
arrested in some gulley, or gets lodged in the bend or creek of
a river. Hence the abundance of gold in the water-courses,
creeks, gullies, and ravines of mountain ranges, which, more or
less, exhibit the usual phenomena; and to suppose that the
precious metal may be found in still greater abundance in the
bowels of the rocks, merely because they have exuded the
quantity you find in the adjacent streams and localities, is
simply to expect the kernel in the nut after it has been
carefully extracted.
At the first blush, the quantity of gold found in the three
great deposits is certainly so abundant that it would lead to
the inference that still greater quantities were yet to be
obtained from the same source. This, however, will prove a
mistake. The gold-seekers, at the present time, are working at
what may be termed the cream ; and, as the latter is cleared
off, the skimmed-milk, ?the metaphor allowed, ?which remains,
will scarcely repay the labour expended upon it. There is no
new feature in such a result; it has been so before, and will be
so again, in the event of other deposits being stumbled upon,
which have hitherto escaped the cupidity of man. We shall
now endeavour to elucidate the text of the chapter, after this
long digression; and as we could not find a more appropriate
place for these views than in connection with mining operations,
we shall make no apology for placing them here.
The search for gold, whether in the sands of rivers, or in
the veins of mines, may be traced to a very high antiquity;
and as well as we can pierce the hazy gloom which sets in
when we enter upon Egyptian affairs, mining appears to have


been practised in that country at a very early period, and the
silting of sands in the water-courses for the precious metal at
a still earlier, if we may rely upon the testimony of the Scrip-
tures. ? And a river went out of Eden to water the garden,
The name of the first is Pison. That is it which
compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;
and the gold of that land is good.?* This, evidently, must
have been stream-washed gold, which is generally free from
any earthy admixture, and was what the Greeks termed
airetpQov, or such as had not undergone the process of fusion.
At this early period the quality of precious metals seems to
have been carefully attended to, or the expression ?good?
would not have been employed in the text. We have a further
confirmation of the fact, in the terms with which the earliest
transfer of property is recorded. ?And Abraham hearkened
unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver,
which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four
hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.? f
It is clear that a peculiar kind of silver was paid, known as the
silver of commerce, which must mean money of full weight, or
unalloyed, such as a merchant could receive in his business
transactions. Here, then, is a step beyond refining the precious
metals ; it is, in fact, the adoption of a standard of value, and
the earliest on record. But we are somewhat premature in
noting this part of the subject.
Viewing ancient history by the light of modern, there is no
great difficulty in tracing the source whence Egypt of old
derived the principal supplies of the precious metals ; and
when we reach the source of supply, we can easily descry the
method of procuring them, whether by mining or by silting
the sand in the great water-courses. Gold is found in Africa,
at the present day, under precisely the same conditions as it
was in the age of the Pharoahs, and the principal source is
in the Kong mountains, that great chain which stretches
right across the Continent of Africa from east to west. The

metal is principally obtained from the deposits of the mountain
torrents, after the rainy season has passed away, and the mode
of separating it from the sand is extremely simple. * The
inhabitants dig pits about forty feet deep, at which point the
greatest portion of the metal generally shows itself, so that the
superstratum of debris must be very considerable; nevertheless,
the quantity obtained is so great among many of the inland
negro nations, that the common utensils of their kings are made
of it. Bowdich, in his Mission to Ashantee, gives a vivid de-
scription of the king and his court, where gold was displayed
in the most abundant variety. Gold dust, therefore, is neces-
sarily an article of commerce and exchange with the several
merchants who trade in their markets, and business at the
present day is transacted in the same manner as it was when
Egypt was a great nation, and Nubia and Ethiopia the rich
mines whence she drew her supplies of gold.
Here is a striking feature of the present Egypt. Speaking
of his father, who was in search of his brethren, Abu Bekr
says,f ? They went to the town of Jenneh, and afterwards to
Ghoneh. There they abode, and continued to serve their
master, collecting much gold for him there. In that country
much gold is found in the plains, hanks of rivers, rocks, and
stones. They break the stones, and grind them, and reduce
them to dust. This is then put into vessels, and washed with
water till the gold is all collected under the water in the ves-
sels, and the dust lies above it. They then pour out this mud
upon the ground, and the gold remains in the vessels, and they
spread it out to dry. After that they try it on a touchstone,
and make such things of it as they are able. They also barter
gold for goods.?
Another description, equally characteristic of the unchanging
habits of the people, is furnished by an intelligent traveller : \ ?
? This town (Misselemiah) is famous for its market, and is the
resort of many merchants from Souakin, who bring cotton,
spices, and perfumes to exchange for gold. Others from
Abyssinia bring slaves, and a few horses. The Souakian mer-

chants bought gold with dollars for the Indian trade. The
whole time the market lasted Hadji Shoomee sat with his
scales before him, weighing gold gratis to all comers. It was
brought in pieces or rings of different sizes, from 30 paras (2d.)
to 240 piastres (�3).?
In addition to these supplies, which, with slight interrup-
tion, poured in periodically, Egypt possessed mining resources
within herself, and, as it were, immediately at her own door.
The mines of the Red Sea, which Agatharchides has left us an
account of, * were worked at an early period. That author
lived in the century preceding the Christian era, and the mines
had then been worked from a very remote date. The account
which he gives of the process of mining, with the minute details
of labour, is so interesting, that we shall make no apology for
transcribing it in extenso :?
? The kings of Egypt compelled many poor people, together
with their wives and children, to labour in the mines, wherein
they underwent more suffering than can be imagined. The
hard rocks of the gold mountains being cleft by heating them
with burning wood, the workmen then apply their iron imple-
ments. The young and active with iron hammers break the
rock in pieces, and form a number of narrow passages, not
running in straight lines, but following the direction of the
veins of gold, which is as irregular in its course as the roots of
a tree. The workmen have lights fastened upon their foreheads,
by aid of which they cut their way through the rock, always
following the white veins of stone. To keep them to their
task an overseer stands by, ready to inflict a blow on the lazy.
The material that is thus loosened is carried out of the galleries
by boys, and received at the mouth by old men and the weaker
labourers, who then carry it to the epoptoe, or inspectors.
These are young men under thirty years of age, strong and
vigorous, who pound the broken fragments in iron ( qy , copper ?)
mortars with a stone pestle, till there is no piece larger than a
pea. It is then placed on grinding-stones, or a kind of mill-
stones, and women, three on each side, work at it till it is
reduced to fine powder. The fine powder is then passed on to
� Long?s Egyptian Antiquities, ii. 9.


a set of workmen called sellangeis (Z-nWayye'is), who place it on
a finely-polished board, not lying in a flat position, hut sloping
a little. The sellangeus, after pouring some water on the
board, rubs it with his hand, at first gently, but afterwards
more vigorously, by which process the lighter earthy particles
slide off along the slope of the hoard, and the heavier parts are
left behind. He then takes soft sponges, with which he presses
on the board rather gently, which causes the lighter particles
to adhere to the sponge, while the heavy shining grains still
keep their place on the hoard, owing to their weight. From
the sellangeis the gold particles are transferred to the roasters
who measure and weigh all that they receive before
putting it into an earthen jar. With the gold particles they
mix lead in a certain proportion, lumps of salt, a little tin, and
barley bran, and putting a cover on the jar that fits tight, and
smearing it all over, they burn it in a furnace for five days and
nights without intermission. On the sixth day they cool the
vessel and take out the gold, which they find somewhat dimi-
nished in quantity: all the other substances entirely disappear.
These mines were worked under the ancient kings of Egypt
but abandoned during the occupation of the country by the
Ethiopians, and afterwards by the Medes and Persians. Even
at the present day we may find copper chisels or implements
in the galleries (the use of iron not being known at that time),
and innumerable skeletons of the wretched beings who lost
their lives in the passages of the mine. The excavations are
of great extent, and reach down to the sea-coast.?
In the valley of Mehadia, in Southern Hungary, the writer
of this little book saw a similar process of separating the sand
and the gold. The sand is gently but constantly agitated upon
a series of planes, nearly horizontal, but slightly inclining
downwards the one to the other; this action causes the lighter
portion to be carried forward, while the heavier particles,
including the gold, subside at the bottom. After repeated
washes of this kind, the heavier portions are subjected to mer-
cury, when the amalgamation is conducted in the usual way.
But in the northern mine at Kremnitz, and at Bockstein, in
Upper Austria, a more skilful process is adopted to extract the


metal. Whenever the latter is held in chemical combination,
as it frequently is, with arsenic and sulphur, it is sent direct to
the smelting-houses at Lend, where it is most effectually
extracted.
With the slight exception of the sponge and the mercury,
these two modes of mining are precisely alike, although their
operation is separated by a period of nearly three thousand
years. It is true there are no slaves in Hungary; but the
labour is exceedingly severe, and the profit in a series of years,
after deducting the expenses of labour, is but very uncertain
and very small. * It appears, however, that the works of
Bockstein, on the whole, are carried on at a loss; so, also, are
those of Transylvania;?while the Hungarian department, in
certain instances, shows a fair profit. In 1844, the balance
was against the Transylvanian department, in the sum of
112,671 florins, or �11,267 sterling; while the same year
shows a profit in the Hungarian accounts of 278,081 florins.
Comparing the preceding statement of the mining processes
of ancient Egypt with those of modern Europe, it appears that
little advance has been made in extracting gold from the
earth; and the inference is but too painfully suggested that
mining operations for the precious metals generally lead to the
misery and impoverishment of those who pursue them. ? Truly
there is a vein for silver, and a place for gold which men
refine,? f exclaims Job in his treatise on mining, which is one
of the most valuable economical contributions to Holy Writ,
and clearly shows that the Arabian patriarch was as well
versed in mining as many of our Cornish men, and that he
must have witnessed, if not practised, those operations himself.
The verse just quoted may, for ought we know, refer to the
mines of the Red Sea, for Job was a man of rare intelligence,
which could only have been acquired by practical observation;
and as there were few or no gold mines in Arabia, according
to a great living authority, J although Heeren?s learned sugges-

tions point in an opposite direction, it is very probable that the
wandering Arabian frequently found his way into Egypt, and
passed through a great portion of Ethiopia, where he might
have seen the precious metal gathered in grains from the water-
courses, and occasionally in lumps from actual mining opera-
tions.
The quantity of gold, however, derived from the mines must
have been limited, as compared with that derived from the
river-washings; and it is fair to infer that the mines would not
have been worked so effectually had the trading intercourse of
the Egyptians and Ethiopians been less frequently interrupted.
The wars that took place between the kings of the north of
Africa and those of the south, caused a serious disturbance to
the caravans which journeyed to different points for trading
purposes, and which comprised the merchants who brought not
only their gold dust, but their ivory, and their slaves, to
exchange for the produce of the Egyptian looms. The precious
metal, which found its way into the great circulating arteries
of the world through this medium, could be procured at a much
cheaper rate than when it was wrung from the reluctant bowels
of the mine.
The Carthaginians obtained their gold principally from the
source just mentioned, while their progenitors, the Phenicians,
found a rich harvest in the peninsula of Spain, which they
turned to profitable account in the East. The site of Ophir is
still an unsettled point, though so large an amount of learned
conjecture has been expended upon it, and, if it ever be settled,
the probability leans to the conclusion, that the great quantity
of gold circulating through Arabia and Syria must have been
derived from the washings of sands rather than from the veins
of ores.
The gold of the Greeks was principally procured by washing
the sands of the more rapid torrents that descended from the
mountains. Herodotus describes the Pactolus as running by
Sardis, ? which in its descent from the mountain Tmolus,
brought down a quantity of gold dust.? The fable of Midas,
who had acquired, by washing in the Pactolus, the power of
converting whatever he touched into gold, is familiar to every


reader of ancient history. So also is the main incident in the
beautiful poem of the Argonauts, which has its origin in the
gold mines of Colchis, instead, however, of the return cargo of
the precious metal being described in the brief style of our bills
of lading, the poet?s imagination has woven it into a vivid nar-
rative of fancy and fact, so that we are completely in the dark,
both as to the quantity procured and the method of procuring
it. The story of Croesus, King of Lydia, is equally familiar to
the classic reader; and Pytheus, who, according to Larcher, was
the proprietor of both gold and silver mines of great richness,
was obliged to enact that only one-fifth of the citizens should
be compelled to devote themselves to work in the mines, as the
employment of the whole caused such a great scarcity of food.
The silver mines of Laurion are intimately connected with the
economical history of Athens, and the mode of working them
is minutely described by a learned German, and as elegantly
translated by an English scholar.*
The Greeks advanced a step beyond the Egyptians in the
art of mining. The ores seem to have been sifted after being
pounded in the mortars; for the sieve is mentioned among the
tools of the miners. They likewise used the bellows and char-
coal. f The gold was melted by a gentle fire, with the addition
of a mixture of salt, nitre, and alum, by which substances the
silver was purified. Though the Greeks were acquainted with
quicksilver, and had plenty of cinnabar, which they used as
paint, they were ignorant of its peculiar properties, or they
would have applied it to quicken the process of separating
the precious metals from the substances with which they
were mostly found. According to Pliny, one Callias, an exten-
sive worker of silver mines in Attica, found cinnabar in his
ore without knowing its value, so nearly two thousand years
afterwards the Peruvians worked the silver mine of Guan-
cavilica long before they discovered the properties of the
same material. There is a remarkable passage in Theo-
phrastus on the subject of mining (de Lap. c. 119) which is

proved by the drawings of Rosellini.


worth quoting ;??Those who dig,? says that intelligent writer,
?in the mines cannot stand upright at their work, but are
obliged to lie down either on their back or on their sides; for
the vein of the earth they dig runs lengthwise, and is only of
the depth of two feet, though considerably more in breadth,
and it is inclosed on every side with hard stones, from which
the ore is drawn forth.? This formation of vein, however,
relates to the silver mines, and not to gold.
Passing from the Greeks to their great imitators in indus-
trial pursuits, the Romans, we find no records of mining
amongst that singular people before the commencement of the
first Punic war, in the year 490 from the foundation of Rome.
The Salassi, who inhabited the modern province of Aosta,
mined for gold and other metals, but procured a scanty supply.
The Po is said to have yielded some gold in its sands, but none
has been found for a very long period; yet, according to Pliny,
there was an express law of the senate against working the
mines, at the same time remarking, that ? Italy yields abundance
of metals.?
This is somewhat enigmatical, and might have remained
so, had not modern science brought to light the fact, that
Italy never has been a gold-producing country, and never
could be, as the formation of her rocks is opposed to the produc-
tion of that metal. Italy contains no old rocks which have heen
mineralized, and assuming this geological fact to be conclusive,
we are disposed to agree with a distinguished authority * who
remarks that the senators simply passed the law to flatter the
national vanity of the Romans.
All the mines, however, of the precious metals were gra-
dually delivered over to the dominion of Rome, by her con-
quests of the countries in which they were found. Carthage,
Spain, Germany, Greece, Asia, and Egypt, within little more
than 140 years after Rome had pushed her cohorts beyond
the Hellespont, became subject to her rule. By the time that
Augustus had reached imperial power, the mineral wealth of
the world might be said to flow into his treasury, and the Capitol
naturally became the great centre of action for the empire,

absorbing the gold and silver, which, otherwise, might have
proportionately circulated at its extremities. The great generals
and pro-consuls remitted to Rome vast sums, which were mostly
the fruits of confiscation, so that the centripetal action of the
precious metals, by this means, became much greater than the
centrifugal. The supply, however, of necessaries required by
the Capitol materially diminished, and in some instances
drained, this accumulation of the precious metals. Pliny,
writing of the mines of Spain, which appear to have been the
principal source of supply, antecedent to those of Dacia, says;?
? Some have related that Asturias, Gallicia, and Lusitania fur-
nish 2000 pounds of gold annually; but Asturias supplies the
most; nor in any other part of the world, during so many ages,
has so great a quantity been obtained. In every species of gold
there is a proportion of silver ; in some one-tenth, in others one-
ninth, and in one instance only one-thirty-sixth was discovered.?
These mines were worked by slaves; but the statement of the
quantity produced must be greatly exaggerated.
Under the reigns of the earlier emperors, a new system of
working the mines was adopted. Instead of farming them out,
the government appointed its own officers, and had the whole
management under its own control. This reform rendered the
mines more profitable, as not only economy of labour was intro-
duced, but the best portion of the production was preserved,
which had not been the case under the preceding management.
The government possessed the mines, and the adjacent lands,
which were occupied by a kind of adscripti glehoe, who cultivated
the latter on a similar condition to the corvees in France.
These occupiers were compelled to give their services and that
of their offspring to the mines, and received the appellation of
glehoe. et metallis adscripti .* Slaves were also employed in the
mines; not those which were ordinarily bought and sold, but
criminals, who had been condemned by law to slavery. The
gold mines of Dacia, (the present Hungarian mines,) were
worked in the time of Trajan under the direction of a collegium
aurariorum ; but there was little skill displayed, and the pro-
duction was proportionately diminished. The great produc-

tiveness of the Spanish mines just cited, according to Strabo,
had put a stop to the working of those of Upper Italy. In the
fifth century the mines had almost ceased to be productive
throughout the empire, which may be attributed in a great
measure to the irruptions of the barbarians. The last glimpse
we obtain of the government taking an interest in them, is the
appointment of a comes metallorum over the mines of Western
Illyria in the year 413.*
Royalty. ?By the law of antiquity, as exercised among all
ancient nations, and at a subsequent period adopted into the
civil law, all the mines and mineral deposits of gold or silver
ore, or of precious stones, belonged, if in the public lands, to the
sovereign, and formed a part of his patrimony; but if they
were on private property, they belonged* to the owner of
the land, subject to the condition that, if worked by him, a
tenth of the produce was to be delivered to the prince; but if
worked by any other person, with the consent of the owner,
two-tenths were to be paid by the operator, one to the sove-
reign, and one to the proprietor of the land.
The inhabitants of this island had carried on mining opera-
tions several centuries before the Romans had obtained a foot-
ing in it. The existence of gold may be presumed, from the
money circulating among the inhabitants, when the Romans
first cultivated their acquaintance. Strabo informs us that
silver mines were worked, and several parts of Cornwall seem
to strengthen the remark. In the time of Julius Caesar iron
was so scarce that pieces of that metal had replaced the gold;
yet, one century later, the former had so increased in quantity
as to become an article of export, f But tin was the principle
metal extracted from our mines. Dr. Jamieson remarks, J that
? gold was found in the alluvial land, and was formerly washed
for in the neighbourhood of Leadhills.? He thinks the gold
was derived from transition rocks, and chiefly from quartz veins
in those rocks. In the reign of James V., three hundred men
are said to have been employed for several summers in washing
for gold, and to have collected �lOO,OOO sterling. The average
produce of each labourer varied from 3d. to 4d per day, which

was a considerable object when wages were only 2d. But when
wages rose to 4d. the undertaking was no longer profitable, and
was soon abandoned.
The decline of the Roman empire, and the consequent dis-
turbance of industrial pursuits, especially that of mining)
materially diminished the quantity of the precious metals ; and,
in the centuries which followed, the value of coined money be-
came greatly advanced, particularly gold. From the seventh
to the fourteenth century the tributaries of the Elbe yielded a
considerable quantity of the precious metal, and the alluvia of
certain portions of the Rhine still proves slightly auriferous; but
neither of these sources are now deserving of special mention.
In Ireland there are indications of gold occurring in more than
ordinary quantity, as the washings in the Wicklow streams at
Crogan Kinshela proved; but although the mountains of the
sister kingdom gave many of the outward and visible signs of
the precious metal, the search for the inward substance proved
as great a disappointment as has occurred, under the same cir-
cumstances, elsewhere. In several parts of Europe there is gold
produced, either in washings of the streams or by mining, but in
such small quantities, if we except Hungary?the principal
source of European supply?that they are scarcely deserving of
notice, were it not to illustrate the general diffusion of the
precious metal, and the equally general capriciousness of
its quantity, when compared with that on its being first dis-
covered.
The discovery of America opened up a rich supply of the
precious metals, and naturally attracted great attention. Gold
poured into Europe in such abundant streams, when something
like a connected transit was established, that it seems almost
fabulous to recite the accounts. It appears by the Register,
or Entry-Book of Seville, that ? from the year 1519 to that of
1617, there came into Spain 536 millions of gold* pistoles.?
When the Spaniards first landed on Hispaniola, they asked the
natives, by signs, where the gold was found which they wore
as ornaments to the nose and ears, when the latter pointed to the
banks of certain rivers and to the sands which were full of

gold.* A certain cacique presented Columbus with a grain of
natural gold, in shape like a pea, which weighed twenty
ounces, and was sent to the King of Spain. In the opinion of
the natives gold was of no more value than sand or shells;
indeed, in several instances, the latter were more highly
prized. The mines of Buona Ventura were extremely rich, as
their name implies, when first worked. It was here that
Garoz and Diaz found that extraordinary lump of gold, which
is said to have weighed 3600 pesos, equal to 200 ounces. The
lump was first noticed by an Indian woman, and purchased by
Bobadilla, the governor, for a present to his royal master; but
it went down, with the ship that bore it, to the bottom of the
sea. But we must cease to cite these golden wonders, and
strictly confine ourselves to pointing out the methods adopted
to bring them to light.
The gold mines of Brazil may be cited as the most produc-
tive since the discovery of America. In the chain of mountains
running parallel with the coast, and in the rivers which flow
from it, especially in the affluents of the Francesco, are to be
found the gold which has been an object of search for the last
three hundred years. The mines of St. Jaragua produced im-
mense treasures two centuries ago.f The formation of the rocks
is similar to other auriferous regions,?granite, sometimes
gniess, containing a portion of horneblende, with mica. The
soil is red, and remarkably ferruginous. The gold lies, for the
most part, in a stratum of rounded pebbles and gravel, called
cascalho, immediately incumbent on the solid rock. In the
valley, where there is water, occur frequent excavations, made
by the gold-washers, to a considerable extent ?some of them
fifty or a hundred feet wide, and eighteen or twenty deep. On
many of the hills, where water can be procured for washing,
particles of gold are found in the soil, scarcely deeper than the
roots of the grass. The mode of procuring the gold is simple,
and may be easily explained. Suppose a loose gravel-like
stratum of rounded quartzose pebbles and adventitious matter,
incumbent on granite, and covered by earthy matter of variable
thickness, where water of sufficiently high level can be ob-

taincd; the ground is then cut in steps, each twenty or thirty feet
wide, two or three broad, and about one deep. Near the bottom
a trench is cut, to the depth of two or three feet. On each
step stand six or eight negroes, who, as the water flows gently
from above, keep the earth continually in motion with shovels,
until the whole is reduced to liquid mud and washed below.
The particles of gold contained in the earth descend to the
trench, when, by reason of their specific gravity, they quickly
precipitate. Workmen are continually employed at the trench
to remove the stones, and clear away the surface, this operation
being greatly assisted by the current of water which falls into
it. After five day?s washing, the precipitation in the trench is
carried to some convenient stream, to undergo a second clear-
ance. For this purpose wooden howls are provided, of a funnel
shape, about two feet wide at the mouth, and five or six inches
deep, call gamellas. Each workman, standing in the stream,
takes into his bowl five or six pounds weight of the sediment,
which generally consists of heavy matter, such as granular
oxide of iron, pyrites, ferruginous quartz, &c., and often precious
stones. They admit certain quantities of water into the bowls,
which they move about so dexterously, that the precious metal,
separating from the inferior and lighter substances, settles to
the bottom and sides of the vessel. They then rinse their
bowls in a large vessel of clean water, bearing the gold in it,
and begin again. The washing of each bowlful occupies from
five to eight or nine minutes ; the gold produced is extremely
variable in quantity, and in the size of its particles, some of
which are so minute that they float, while others are found as
large as peas, and not unfrequently much larger. This opera-
tion is superintended by overseers, as the result is of consider-
able importance. When the whole is finished, the gold is
placed upon a brass pan over a slow fire to be dried, and at a
convenient time is taken to the permutation office, where it is
weighed, and a fifth reserved for the Prince.
In the district of Minas Geraes gold is abundantly scattered
through the rocks of the mountains, the superincumbent soil,
and the beds of the rivers, over a surface of many thousand
square miles in extent, but generally in such minute particles


as to require a considerable degree of labour in collecting
it: sometimes it is found in crystals, at others, in dendritical
forms, but rarely in lumps, although a piece was picked up at
Villa Rica which weighed sixteen pounds. It is said that this
metal has frequently been found in little lumps under the roots
of plants pulled out of the ground, being accidentally washed
there by the rains. So universally indeed is gold disseminated
over the central parts of Brazil, that a golden shower, more
extensive and substantial than that which is said to have en-
riched the lap of Danaoe, might be supposed to have fallen
upon them. In the mountains the precious metal is found in
a red heavy loam, in beds of clay-slate, mica-slate, or in
veins of quartz, and red ironstone. It usually assumes its
most beautiful form in the large foliated iron mica-slate,
and is also found in arsenical iron pyrites. But, the greatest
of all treasures, yet the most neglected, is a very fertile soil
covered with a luxuriant vegetation, and capable of producing
every luxury and necessary of life, with a climate both tem-
perate and agreeable. Here, however, as elsewhere, the auri
sacra fames has extended a baneful influence over the infa-
tuated inhabitants. Neglecting agricultural pursuits, their
whole attention has till lately been drawn to the mines, a
lottery in which the great prize generally remains in the
wheel.* The condition of Villa Rica conveys an important
moral. ?It is quite evident,? says this intelligent traveller,
? from the deserted houses and general appearance of neglect,
that there is no longer the population that it once contained
(1825), nor the affluence which at one time prevailed in such
an extraordinary degree. No place exhibits a more interesting
spectacle to the moralist than this. A large mountain, thickly
veined with gold, draws, on that account, a population of
upwards of thirty thousand persons, who, in the course of
sixty or seventy years, exhaust its precious riches. Poverty has
now her full sway at Villa Rica; the streets swarm with mendi-
cants, who, if diseased, confine themselves entirely to begging ;
but if in health, alternately try the boat in the streams, and
the charity of the more affluent in the town.? There are three

modes of collecting the scattered particles of gold ; by scraping
up the sediment of rivers, by splitting the rock with fire or
powder, and carrying the fragments to a stamping-mill, and
by turning streams of water into trenches made in loamy auri-
ferous soils, along the declivities of the mountains. The process
of amalgamation, without which the gold can never be properly
separated from the specular ironstone, antimony, and arsenic,
is, however, but ill understood and little practised.
In the environs of the village of Cocoes, the most numerous
washings are established; and here th epepitas* or lumps and
scales of gold occur, mingled with the sands of rivers or the
alluvial deposits on their banks. The greatest quantity was
found between 1753 and 1763, since which it has gradually
decreased. According to one authority,! the whole quantity
collected between 1700 and 1820 amounted to a million and odd
pounds weight avoirdupois, or about 14,800 lbs. annually,
including one-fifth, which he thinks was smuggled out of the
country. Between 1753 and 1763 it amounted annually to
about 16,000 lbs., but between 1801 and 1829 only to 3540 lbs.
The decrease of the produce was mainly owing to the best
portions of the sand being exhausted, and the capital to work
the veins on a regular system. British capital has been for the
last quarter of a century employed in the mines of Congo Soco,
but the result appears anything but promising, if we may
judge by the following returns, which present a decennial

The mines of Mexico are not productive of gold; nor are those
of Peru. In Central America there are some streams which
yield a fair quantity of the precious metal, but none of them
afford a large profit for the labourer. Loyd, in his intelligent

notes on Panama,* observes that Vargua and Choco have
yielded considerable quantities of gold, by -washings in the
streams, and of a very pure nature; there are but few other
spots, according to the best authorities, worth working in that
range of country.
Directing our attention to another quarter of the rich
metalliferous regions of America, we observe nearly the same
phenomenon. ? Almost all the precipitous and broken grounds
of Chili,? writes an intelligent traveller,f ? contain gold in
greater or less quantities; the surface of the earth in which it
is found is generally of a reddish colour and soft to the touch.
The lavaderos, or places producing earth which yield gold by
agitating it in water, are very common in Chili, but the indo-
lence of the natives, and the want of labourers, suffer
immense treasures to remain in the earth which might easily
be obtained. Nine or ten leagues to the east of Coquimbo are
the lavaderos of Andacoll, which produce gold of twenty-three
carats fine, and are worked constantly with great profit when
there is no scarcity of water.? Coquimbo, Capiopo, and Guasco,
contain the principal gold mines, the ore of which is called, by
way of distinction, ore capote, as being the most valuable of
any that has hitherto been discovered.}; Garcilasso, in his
History of Peru, observes, ? that Pedro de Valdivia, who
entered Chili after Alraagro, opened mines of gold which were
so rich that each Indian furnished from thirty to forty ducats
daily, as, when only twelve or fifteen were employed, he
obtained three or four hundred ducats a day. Valdivia received
from his vassals an annual tribute of one hundred thousand
pieces of gold.? �
Other authorities might be cited, had we space, in confir-
mation of these views, and corroborating in the fullest degree,
the great plenty of gold throughout the mountain ranges of
Chili. The mining for the precious metal, however, produces
the same economical results as elsewhere?the wandering,
unsettled, and reckless mode of life of those who are engaged
in the pursuit, and their consequent immoral and degraded

condition. Speaking of the yield of the mines, a distinguished
authority observes, ? that in many places the miners are
allured at first with appearances of great riches, but some find
the ore entirely fail, or in so small quantities as not to repay
them for their labour. The metallurgists of Chili call this
kind of wandering mine bolson ; the same name is also applied
to the ramifications, which in general are circular, and to the
richest veins, where the ore is found lodged in heaps and
cavities.? *
The matrix of the gold is very variable, and it may be said
that there is no kind of stone or rock but what serves it for
that purpose. It is to be seen everywhere, either in small
grains, or brilliant spangles, under singular forms or in irre-
gular masses, that may be cut by the chisel. The most usual
matrix is a very brittle red claystone. The salbanda, or exte-
rior covering of the veins, called by miners caxas, is as variable
as the matrix; it is sometimes of spar or quartz ; at others it
consists chiefly of flint, marble or hornblend.f The washing is
performed in the following manner: ?the earth or sand, con-
taining particles of gold, is put into a vessel of wood or horn,
called porura, which is placed in a running stream, and con-
stantly shaken ; by this means the sand, which contains no
metallic particles, being lighter, is thrown over the top, and
the more weighty, or the gold, remains at the bottom. This
operation is necessary to be repeated several times, in order to
carry off all the ferruginous earth, which is always united with
the gold.
The miners, according to the authority just cited, are expert
in mining, and in the art of assaying and refining metals ; but
their knowledge is wholly practical, and they are entirely
ignorant of the theory, or the real principles of the art. In
general they are a bold, enterprising, and prodigal class of
men. Familiarized to the sight of precious metals, they learn
to disregard them, and attach but little value to money. They
are extravagant in their expenses, and passionately addicted to
gaming, in which they pass almost all their leisure hours.
Nothing is more abhorrent to them than frugality; and when-

ever they find one of their companions, who has amassed a sum
of money by his economy, they leave no means untried to strip
him of it, observing, that avarice is a vice peculiarly degrading
to a miner; and so addicted are they to inebriety, that those
?who, on first joining them, are remarkable for their abstemi-
ousness, are soon led, from the influence of example, to partici-
pate in the general intemperance. From these causes none of
them acquire property, and they generally die in the greatest
poverty and distress, while the profits of their labours are
wholly absorbed by those who supply them with provisions
and liquor.
Moorcroft noticed in the district of Kolen,* at eight days
journey from Yungee-Kishlak, a country which abounds with
gold in grains and masses. The Emperor of China employs
from five hundred to a thousand men constantly in collecting
it. The unfortunate Burnes, also, found the fishermen in the
Indus and Cabool rivers, washing the sand for gold; and he
remarks that some of the smaller streams, such as the Swan
and Hunoo, yield more gold than the Indus. The precious
metal has also been found at the foot of the Neelgherrie Moun-
tains, in great purity, but not as yet in great abundance.
Gold, instead of being a blessing to a country in which it
abounds, appears to contain the very elements of debasement
and degradation. There is scarcely an exception to this widely
general rule. In the remote provinces of Tartary and Thibet
it producss the same result, as in Europe or America. ?It
may be concluded,? says a highly intelligent traveller,f ? that
this country (Thibet) is perhaps the richest, and, at the same
time, the poorest in the world; rich in gold and silver, poor in
all that constitutes the well-being of the masses. The gold
and silver collected by the people is absorbed by the great
people, and especially by the Lamaseries, those immense reser-
voirs into which flow all the wealth of these vast regions.
The Lamas, invested with the major part of the currency, by
the voluntary directions of the faithful, centuple their fortunes

being thus accumulated, and the necessaries of life being only-
procurable at a very high price, it results that a great propor-
tion of the population is constantly plunged in the most frightful
situation. Thibet, so poor in agricultural and manufacturing
products, is rich, beyond all imagination, in metals. Gold and
silver are collected there so readily, that the common shepherds
have become acquainted with the art of purifying those metals.
You often see them in the ravines, or in the hollows of the
mountains, seated round a fire of argols, amusing themselves
with purifying in a rude crucible the gold-dust they have found
while tending their herds.? The result of this abundance of
the precious metals is, that specie is of low value, and that,
consequently, goods always maintain a high price.
In a similar range of country, and not remotely distant
from Thibet, we have presented the great Ural chain, with its
rich auriferous contents. In the notice of these mountains by
an intelligent traveller,* we find the following remarks:?? The
sand, containing small particles of gold, occurs along the eastern
and western declivity of the Ural range ; but contains less gold
in the latter, and in fewer places. On the Siberian side, the
sand from which the gold is extracted contains about one and
a half, or two zolotnick of gold in a pood, or from 1-22 80th to
l-1920th ; that which contains less is at present not worked.
Mr. Rose says that even sand containing l-7680th of gold can
still be washed with profit. The expenses in washing gold
containing between l-2280th and l-1920th of gold, amount
commonly to two-fifths of its net produce. Sometimes sand is
found, of which l-600th, and even l-300th is gold; it amounts
to between 2 and 11 parts in 100. The first establishment for
working this sand was made in 1814 at Berezowsk, near Yeka-
terinburg, and since then they have increased. More than
two-thirds of the gold is the washings of the sands.?
In Carolina and Georgia (North America) gold has been
found in considerable quantities, but the pursuit is not followed
up with that spirit which would indicate that it is very profit-
able. The Carolina and Georgia mines, according to Professor
Ansted, have yielded masses of gold of considerable size, one

having been found weighing 28 lbs. avoirdupois. The average
annual quantity for the last three years is something less than
3000 lbs. weight, or in value �175,000. The mines are on the
Appalachian range, particularly on the eastern slope from
Maine to Alabama, having a north-east and south-west course.
In a succeeding chapter we shall give a full and detailed
account of the gold regions of California and Australia, which
the preceding summary will probably enable the reader to
more fully appreciate.
CHAPTER IV.
GENERAL CHARACTER OF GOLD?VARIATIONS IN VALUE-
PECULIAR AFFECTION FOR IT AMONG MANKIND.
The foundations on which is built up the power of the
precious metals in human affairs, are pretty deeply seated in
the mind. Those who delight in tracing final causes, and in
meditating on particular instances of design, can hardly mis-
take the evidence of wisdom observable in the arrangement
regarding the precious metals, and will be struck with its
peculiar adaptation to the requirements of man as a progressive
being, whether struggling into society or far advanced in the
career of civilization,
That the precious metals were designed as instruments in
the production of human civilization, may be inferred from the
peculiar affection which man invariably entertains for them
as compared to other commodities. All objects produced by
labour are, more or less, objects of human desire, as they are
supposed to contribute to human enjoyment; but the desire
for these several objects is by no means uniform and unvary-
ing, as daily experience proves; on the contrary, it is fre-
quently capricious, partial, and ununiform, and is apt to vary
according to time, place, and circumstance. A certain quantity
of each will generally satisfy human wants, and more is seldom


used, either by individuals or by communities; but gold and
silver must be ranked as exceptional objects, as the desire for
them is uniform, constant, and inappeasable, at least wherever
man has made any progress in civilization. These precious
metals, therefore, have always held the highest place?the
place of honour?in his affections, and no assignable quantity
in possession, like other commodities, seems, in the slightest
degree, to endanger their position.
The primary utility of gold was, most probably, for the
manufacture of rude utensils, and for ornaments, so that the
desire to possess it may be measured by the uses to which it
was applied. The rude and untutored Indian only valued gold
according to his limited wants; he made ornaments of it occa-
sionally for his nose or for his ears, or shaped it into fish-hooks
or other ordinary, but useful, objects; therefore, the early
voyagers to the country of the Indians easily obtained it for
the most insignificant trifles. This was the first stage of man?s
affection for the precious metal.
At a period long antecedent to the preceding, when civili-
zation had progressed considerably amongst men, we find gold,
or rather its cognate metal in value, silver, in its second stage of
utility. It had then advanced to become the standard of value,
and an instrument of exchange, a test by which all other com-
modities were estimated. The peculiar qualities of the precious
metals naturally pointed them out for this especial service;
they were more durable, more capable of divisibility without
any appreciable loss, and, above all, were more easily identi-
fied as to quality, than any other known substance.
The experience of the second stage of utility must have
materially augmented man?s preceding affection for gold and
silver; and, in proportion as practical wisdom extended his
power over a greater number of desirable objects, did his love
for those precious metals increase, for experience quickly
taught him that they could be exchanged for everything he
desired to enjoy. We have seen that Abraham gave Ephron a
piece of silver as the price of his wife?s burial-place, simply
because the latter would not have accepted so many head of
cattle in payment, so at least it may be inferred, for cattle were


not so readily exchanged as a definite quantity of the precious
metal, either in his own country or in that where Abraham
himself had derived the custom. Ephron, as a man of sub-
stance in those days, must have journeyed to Egypt, like the
patriarch, and was evidently versed in the sale and transfer of
property, therefore took in payment the most valuable com-
modity that it was then customary to tender, for his piece of
land.
The gradual extension of man?s power over the material
world at length completed the last stage in the complex forma-
tion of his affection for gold. That precious metal was clearly
not the end of his desires, but the means to gratify those
desires ; for who does not perceive that under the thin veil of
a mere love for gold?in itself far less useful than iron?are
scarcely concealed the various and multiplied affections of the
human heart for the several objects around it ? Without the
instrumentality of the precious metals the affections of man
could only be gratified to a limited extent, nor could manufac-
tures and commerce have extended themselves beyond a very
limited degree. The desire for gold, therefore, may be termed
directly as civilization, and inversely as the opposite state of
existence prevails. The inference from these remarks would
lead to the conclusion that there is no limit to the desire for
gold. Nor is there; for experience proves that there is no
assignable limit to human desires; that, as one inconvenience
is removed others present themselves, which before had never
been thought of; that the passion for wealth expands with the
gratification of existing wants, and, if not absolutely infinite,
may at least be termed indefinite : that, in short, man?s desire
is capable of extending itself far beyond the bounds which even
imagination can assign as the limit of human understanding.
No one can entertain any reasonable doubt as to the general
truth of these propositions, or would venture to maintain that,
were the aggregate incomes of all persons increased tenfold,
they would find any great difficulty in disposing of them.
?Neo Croesi fortuna unquam, nec Persica regna,
Sufficient animo,?
is a grave truth, which has been acknowledged by philosophy,


and confirmed by the experience of mankind, and just as appli-
cable in these days as it was when the Roman satirist levelled
it against his own.
In order, however, to fully appreciate the value and in-
fluence of the precious metals, we must go back to that distant
time when first
? ?The gorgeous east with richest hand
Showered on her kings barbaric pearl and gold
or, in more sober language, when commerce and manufactures
caused gold and silver to flow into Western Asia with such
profusion that the merchant-prince of that age converted the
one into common ? targets,? and made the other ?to be in
Jerusalem as stones.?* The quantity of the precious metals which
Solomon accumulated is almost beyond conception, were it not
well attested both by divine and by profane testimony, which
historical research has so conclusively furnished. There is
revealed to us the great transit-trade of Western Asia, the
centre of which was in the heart of that Jewish king?s domi-
nions, and by following the land and sea routes which commerce
then took, we can easily account for his extraordinary accumu-
lation of wealth. While the products of India found their
way to the western world, those of Egypt and Ethiopia were
moving in an opposite direction, ?both naturally seeking a
convenient point for exchange. The inter-agents of that
exchange necessarily acquired wealth, and ultimately became
the arbiters and disposers of all those products. Solomon, from
his central position between the Red Sea and the Mediter-
ranean, with the Phenicians and their rich manufactures on
the one hand, and with his maritime command on the other,
naturally became the point around which a great portion of
the wealth of that age concentrated. There were the horses,
the fine linen, and the rich products of the looms of Egypt,
annually seeking a market in the dominions of the Syrian
prince, and there the myrrh and frankincense of Arabia for
the same purpose; at a distance which his ships could reach

the slaves and the gold-dust of Ethiopia; in an opposite direc-

tion, with a new world at their command for trading purposes,
were the most skilled mariners of Europe, and the most inge-
nious manufacturers in the world. There was Solomon, then,
in the centre of the great moving elements of the age, and,
being especially endowed with worldly wisdom, he naturally
turned them to good account, at least so far as his own per-
sonal grandeur w T as concerned. So long, therefore, as he could
keep the great pulse of the world under his finger, and influence
all the great arteries of communication, he could not fail to
accumulate riches in one form or another, and the mere enu-
meration of his wealth is sufficient to attest his ability in that
respect.
The ? barbaric pearl and gold,? however, is generally the
leading feature in the riches and splendour of an Asiatic
monarch, and, with a slight change of name or so, the descrip-
tion of Solomon?s court and palace might be applied to that of
Nadir Shah, or, to come nearer to our own time, to that of Tippoo
Saib or Surrajah Dowla. With slight exceptions, the reading
of the one is almost the reading of the other. There are three
peculiar objects which occupy invariably the leading positions
in the tableau of an oriental prince, namely, gold, concu-
bines, and precious stones. The first and last vary according
to the locality in which the prince may chance to reign,
but the intermediate object is pretty uniform throughout the
eastern hemisphere. Take at random, for example, any half-
dozen passages from the Old Testament, and it will he diffi-
cult to avoid stumbling upon the term gold : in fact, it seems
as familiar to the ear as ?crocodile,? when reading of the banks
of the Nile, or ? elephant,? when perusing the descriptions of
our Indian nabobs. ? Then halt thou lay up gold as dust,
and the gold of Ophir as the stones,? exclaims Job; and when
the queen of Sheba went up to prove Solomon with hard ques-
tions at Jerusalem, say the Chronicles, ? She was escorted
with a very great company, and camels that bore spices, and
gold in abundance .? In fact, the gold which Solomon acquired,
by one means or another, became so abundant in his coffers,
that he absolutely used it, as we have already remarked, for
the most ordinary purposes.


We must bear in mind, however, that the custom of Asiatic
sovereigns was the same in the time of Solomon as at the
present day; so, indeed, was that of the great mass of the
community over whom they held sway. Both in outline and
in internal detail, the habits of the east seem to have been
preserved with the most rigid minuteness, and to have resisted
change with almost unbroken uniformity. To amass enormous
treasures, for instance, was as common in the days of Solomon
as at the present time, which simply implies that the reigning
prince was absolute master of the wealth, and almost of the will,
of his subjects. Asiatic princes, in all ages, have been igno-
rant of that invaluable principle of European policy, under
which it is found less profitable to hoard up money than to
leave it in circulation. It is not, therefore, astonishing that
the accumulation of the precious metals by Solomon should be
very large, as the transit-trade alone, irrespective of the tributes
of other nations, must have yielded him immense sums. We
have the testimony, likewise, of profane writers, of the
then general profusion of gold and silver in Arabia. The
precious metals must therefore have been of much less value
than at the present time; and their relation to each other
experienced such singular changes, that modern times furnish
no parallel wherewith to institute a comparison. Belying upon
profane writers, who state that the precious metals were more
abundant in Arabia than in any other known country, we
have scarcely an incident in histoiy that approximates to
it, except the quantity of gold and silver found by the
Spaniards in Mexico and Peru. Diodorous mentions a river in
Deboe ( Hedjaz ) that abounded in small lumps of most beauti-
ful gold. Arrian, Strabo, and Agatharchides describe, in
glowing terms, the wealth of the settled Arabians in precious
metals. The pillars of their houses, says one of these authori-
ties, were resplendent with gold and silver; they had, also, ves-
sels and domestic utensils of the same metal; and their persons
were profusely adorned with various ornaments, composed of the
same materials. It is even said that gold was in such plenty that
it was but thrice the value of brass, and only twice that of iron,
while silver was regarded as ten times more valuable than gold.


Of the abundance of the precious metals, therefore, we have
the clearest and most indubitable proof, but of the relative
value of the one with the other, we have little more than con-
jecture to enlighten us. Silver appears to have been the stan-
dard of value in Egypt, and was most likely adopted by the
Israelites, as we find the common people amongst them, upon
whom a poll-tax was levied for the construction of the taber-
nacle, paying their contributions in that metal; while, on the
contrary, the richer class, who could afford gold ear-rings, paid
theirs in the most precious metal, but not in the shape of
money, like their inferiors.
The gold contributed to the structure of the tabernacle
exceeded the silver by about four to one,* therefore it may be
inferred that the payments of the more humble and numerous
class of the Israelites must have been in small coins, or pieces
of metal, such as they would receive in the ordinary payment
for their labour. Here we have the rich ornaments of gold on
the one hand, and silver in the shape of money on the other,
which throws considerable light upon the separate uses of those
two metals, but very little as to their relative value. This
brings us to another point of considerable importance as to the
relation of the two metals.
Gold appears to have been much earlier recognized among
the special objects of value than silver, although silver appears
to have performed the actual functions of money, in the first
instance. Joseph was sold by his brethren for twenty pieces of
silver, to a caravan of Midianitish merchants, at the very time
that these merchants were journeying towards Egypt to
exchange their produce for gold-dust amongst other commodi-
ties, which they disposed of at a large profit in their own
country. Again, we find at a subsequent period that the
brethren of Joseph brought ?silver in their sacks? mouths? to
? A writer of no mean authority has estimated the cost of the Tahernacle at
upwards of �200,000 of our money, hut assumes that the silver should he valued
at ss. per ounce, and the gold at �4, which gives the relation at present existing
between the two metals. It is not stated upon what authority this calculation is
made, therefore, we presume, it must he purely conjectural, especially as colla-
teral circumstances seem to weigh against it. Vide Pictorial Bible, notes on
Exodus, ch. 25.


purchase corn, which clearly indicates that silver, and not gold,
was the ordinary standard of value in that age. Whence came
this silver ? Not from Nubia and Ethiopia, which produced
gold and copper, but no silver, or the sources whence it was
derived would have been apparent at the present day.* The
weight of historic testimony inclines to Spain as the original
seat, the rich and prolific source for the supply of silver, at the
period to which we allude. The mines of Eaurion had not
then been discovered, for the Greeks were but little better than
roving pirates, who preyed upon the richer and more settled
industry of their neighbours. Heerenf has satisfactorily cleared
up this question. ? When the first Phenicians,? observes that
profound historian, ? visited Spain, it is said they found silver
there in such abundance, that they not only freighted their
ships with it to the water?s edge, hat made their common
utensils, anchors not excepted, of this metal.? Thus laden,
they returned back to their own country, and, being a mari-
time people, they naturally distributed this precious metal in
profitable exchange throughout the great trading marts of the
world. It was, doubtless, in this manner that silver found its
way into Egypt, and into Arabia; and, upon the first introduc-
tion of that metal into the latter country, it was so highly
esteemed from its natural beauty, that it was valued at nine
times a higher rate than gold, according to the authority we
have just cited. The Arabians, in fact, were familiar with
gold, and knew from experience its precise value, but silver
was new to them, and from its rarity naturally commanded a
higher rate of exchange ; but when the Phenicians poured large
quantities of that metal into Arabia, it soon began to decline,
and ultimately settled down at the point which its supply,
when measured with that of gold, would naturally determine.
There was no large accumulation of the precious metals in
Greece for nearly 300 years after Solomon?s reign, for history
contains several scattered remarks of their great scarcity down
? Mr. Jacob, generally an invaluable authority, remarks that these countries
furnished a large share of the gold and silver accumulated before the Christian
era, but cites no writer of weight in support of his observation as regards silver.

to the time of Philip, which forms a striking contrast with
their abundance in Egypt and Judea at the same period. At
the siege of Troy, about a century after the time of Solomon,
though some of the chiefs had ornaments about their arms of
gold and silver, the use of these metals was beyond the reach
of their followers. Neither Homer nor Hesiod speak of gold
or silver as money, hut express the value of commodities by a
certain number of sheep or oxen. The wealth of individuals
was measured by the number of their flocks and herds, the
primitive standard of the Asiatic plains, or by other material
objects, much inferior to the precious metals. Trade was car-
ried on by barter, and the Greeks of that age had not advanced
to a metallic standard of value in their transactions.*
The rapturous exclamation of Xenophon, that ? Athens had
received a gift from heaven,? upon the discovery of the silver
mines of Laurion, marks an era in the monetary system of the
ancients. Here we first begin to descry the relative value of
gold and silver, and the important part which these metals
performed in the affairs of the world. The produce of the silver
mines enabled Themistocles to found the naval force of his
country; and nothing so much promoted the trade of Athens
as the purity of her silver coin, which was everywhere received
as a medium of exchange.! Greece had now emerged from her
piratical condition, and had taken her station among the great
trading communities of the age, for she coined money, and pre-
sented her neighbours with a standard of value by which they
could regulate their mutual exchanges, the earliest indication
of an honest and thriving position in the world. The
Athenians, however, confined themselves to one single species
as a standard issue. Silver coins, descending from the tetra-
drachm to the quarter obol, were the only legal currency at
Athens. The gold coins of foreign countries, being much
employed in commerce, were received in payment at the trea-
sury, and in the larger dealings of the home trade; but they
appear to have circulated according to their intrinsic value,

when measured by the Athenian currency, which was then
established upon something like an equitable basis.
The confusion and difficulty, however, which must naturally
arise in a commercial state, where money of different values are
in constant circulation, began to exhibit itself at a very early
period among the Athenians. Xenophon saw the difficulty at
once, and with the intuitive perception of a statesman. We
could almost imagine that he was speaking in this age, and not
upwards of two thousand years ago, so clearly did he compre-
hend the economical bearings of the question. ?If any one,?
says that enlightened Greek, ? should tell me that gold is no
less serviceable than silver, so far Ido not contradict him; but
this I know, that if gold becomes abundant, it sinks in its value,
and raises the value of silver .? * The relative value of gold
and silver, at that time, appears to have been in the proportion
of ten to one. The value of gold, however, rose, partly on
account of the proportionally larger increase of silver, until it
arrived at ratios similar to those of modern Europe, namely,
from 13| to 15 to 1.
The earliest gold coin, we believe, is the daric, which com-
monly circulated amongst the Greeks and in Asia Minor,
although some authorities incline to give the precedence to the
stater, which was coined by Croesus, King of Lydia. Greece,
at that period, was poor in gold. Subsequently, however, the
golden statue of Victory at Athens was coined into money,
probably upon some urgent occasion, which Aristophanes desig-
nated as wretched pieces of copper, from their being much
debased with that metal. The statue itself most likely had
nothing more than a coating of gold upon an inferior metal, a
practice in the fine arts not confined to the Greeks, but some-
times practised by their instructors, the Egyptians and Assy-
rians. Gold was also coined by the petty rulers of the Greek
isles, as well as those of Sicily; by Gelo, 491 years before
Christ; by Hiero, 478 A.c. ; and by Dionysius 404 years before
that era. There were no gold coins, however, in Greece of any
consequence, till Philip of Macedon worked the mines of Thrace,
which paved his way to the conquest of that country. The

saying of Philip that a donkey and hamper of gold could most
effectually silence the thunder of the Grecian orators, was a
true but painful comment upon the spirit and patriotism of the
time.* Demosthenes affords an insight into the relative value
of the precious metals when he remarks that 120 Cyzecenic
staters passed in the Bosphorus for 3360 attic drachmas, 1 for
28, not, probably, because their w T eight was greater than the
drachmas, but because the value of gold was then higher in
that country, being to silver in the ratio of 14 to l.f
There appear, then, four modes of acquiring the precious
metals?first, by labouring in mines or among the sands of
rivers; secondly, by producing commodities which are exchange-
able with those who possess the metals; thirdly, by moving com-
modities from one part of the world to another; and, fourthly,
by violence or conquest. We have now only to consider the
last mode of acquisition as an element of disturbance, or of dis-
tribution.
Conquest has occasionally divei'ted the precious metals from
their ordinary channels for centuries together ; it has some-
times destroyed those channels altogether, and dried up the very
sources of supply. One of the earliest and most memorable
instances of this kind is the campaign of Alexander the Great.
The quantity of the precious metals which the followers of that
conqueror brought with them, after their return from the east,
must have been immense. Gold was everywhere in abundance,
and gradually diffused itself throughout the eastern world,
until its relative value to silver receded from 14 to 10 to 1.
The ravages of the Parthians in the later times of the Homan
Empire, and the final conquest of Asia Minor by the Mahom-
medans, which completely exhausted the countries lying
between the Euphrates and the Mediterranean, once so rich in
the possession of gold, are two more instances of a similar kind,
and finally, the conquests of the barbarians in the fifth century,
which were marked not only by a displacement of the precious

metals, but, in some instances, with the absolute destruction of
the mines.
We have remarked in the preceding chapter that the great
bulk of gold and silver in circulation, when Rome arrived
at the apex of power, naturally found its way to that impe-
rial city; and, from a variety of causes which affected their
value at different periods, their relative fluctuations present
some singular features. At the payment of the Etolians, in
the year of the city of Rome 564, when they were allowed to
pay one-third in gold, we learn that the proportion prescribed
between the two metals was 10 to 1; but a few years preced-
ing, in the year 547, the ratio of gold and silver was as 17
1-7 th to 1, which soon afterwards narrowed itself to 13 5-7ths
to 1. In the time of Julius Caesar, on account of the large
influx of gold from Gaul, the ratio fell as low as about 9 to 1;
and Polybius relates, that in consequence of the sudden supplies
from the mines of Aquilea, the value of gold fell one-third.
However, after the conquest of Sicily, which yielded a large
booty of silver, the relation of the two metals was as 17 to 1;
and as the empire approached its decrepitude, a sensible
decrease in the quantity of gold began to show itself, especially
under Valentinian, when its relative value to silver was as 14|
to 1. Under Honorius the relation between the two metals
was still wider; and in the year 422 it appears to have attained
its maximum, when it stood as 18 to 1. In short, nearly
throughout the whole period of Roman supremacy and decline,
the precious metals were subject to violent oscillations, for
their delicate and susceptible nature cannot endure an abrupt
and sudden change, and the equilibrium of their values can only
be maintained under the influence of a healthy and steadily-
diffused industry.
Although the wealth of the world, however, might be
said to flow into the Roman treasury, at the commencement
of the empire, there was generally a great scarcity of the
precious metals, as is proved by the high and fluctuating rate
of interest which so frequently prevailed. From the very
nature of things this must have been the case. Rome imported
almost everything she required, so that there was a constant


drain upon her resources, and, had not the remittances of tribute
annually replenished her with the precious metals, she could
have scarcely retained a single piece of gold or silver in circu-
lation. The Homan bankers, who farmed the distant provinces,
were the possessors of the current cash of the state, and lent it
out to those who required it, and who were sufficiently stable
to obtain credit. These argentarii transacted business in a
similar manner to the bankers of the present day; they paid
the written orders of those w T ho had money in their hands, and
opened regular debtor and creditor accounts with their different
clients, as though they had been located like a shroff in Bombay,
or a wealthy firm in Lombard Street. The tabulce accepti
et expensi, w 7 ere the transferred sums from the credit of one to
that of another, when payment w 7 as not required in coin, just as
such transfers are made at the present day by Jorloni in
modern Rome, or by the banks in Glasgow or Edinburgh.
These bankers, in fact, were called into existence by the very
scarcity of the precious metals, for the transactions of commerce,
as well as those of the state, were, in great part, liquidated by
drafts upon their different agents. The Roman hankers had
their agents at Alexandria, at Antioch, in Spain and in Gaul,
so that a letter of credit, permitting the term, could be made
available as currency, at every point of importance throughout
the empire, and the necessity of providing the precious metals
for that purpose obviated. We have it on record, for instance,
that the Vectigal of Asia was farmed by a company of Roman
knights, and that the latter were deeply indebted to the bankers
of Rome. Previous to the conquest of Asia by Pompey, the
annual remittance amounted to nearly two millions of our
money, and this must have been but a small portion of the sum
exacted from the Asiatics by the Roman knights, as we read of
the former entreating Julius Caesar to commute the annual
tribute to four millions sterling. In the beginning of the
Mithridatic war, however, the failure of remittances from these
knights ruined the Roman bankers; and towards its close, some
twenty years later, we find Cicero urging the people to entrust
the management of the war to his friend, in order that the ap-
prehended failure of the remittances might be averted. Roman


credit, exclaims the orator, depends entirely on the Asiatic re-
mittances, and if it is not sustained the Forum will be again
insolvent.* So that the failure of four millions annual remit-
tance to Rome endangered the position of the Roman hankers,
and was sufficient to shake the monetary system of the empire
to its very base. This may be accounted for, we apprehend, on
the supposition that the precious metals were occasionally very
scarce. Another circumstance seems to confirm this view of the
case. When Julius Caesar entered Rome, he is said to have
seized the treasury, and to have plundered right and left, in
order to acquire means for the accomplishment of his political
designs ;f and by circulating the fruits of his plunder, we learn
that the value of gold and silver was altered relatively from 10
to Bor7|to 1. If the few millions which Caesar could lay
hands on had the effect described, it is reasonable to infer that
the amount of the precious metals must have been compara-
tively small and limited to few hands, otherwise so great and
sudden an alteration in their relative values could not have
ensued. Wherever the precious metals are largely accumulated,
or pretty generally diffused, a sudden rise or fall in value is
seldom effected either by the subtraction or addition of any
given sum, however relatively large it may be; but, on the
contrary, where the amount operated upon is comparatively
small, and confined to a limited space, the alleged effect is almost
sure to ensue.
Fluctuations, therefore, in the interest of money, especially
when they partake of a violent and changing nature, are pretty
sure indications of a scarcity of the precious metals; the phe-
nomena are alike observable under commercial as under military
regimes, although they are more frequently remarked in the
latter, and are more violent in their nature. Pliny, the younger,
observes that the ordinary rate of interest was tAvelvc per cent.,
* Nam coeterarum provinciarum Yectigalia, Quirites, tanta sunt, ut its ad
ipsas provincias tutandas vix content! esse possimus. Asia vero tam opima est

but previous to the period of which he speaks it was much
higher, for Cicero complains that one per cent, per month, and
frequently more, had the effect of drawing all the money out of
the hands of the many into those of the few; and to such an
extent had this high rate of interest operated, that but little of
the precious metals was left amongst the general people. Out
of one million and a quarter of the inhabitants of the city
and suburbs of Rome, the orator remarks that there were
scarcely 1000 persons who possessed property at all.* Of the
general scarcity of money, or rather precious metals, we have
another instance in the policy of Augustus, as regards loans
and rates of interest. The enormous amounts exacted for the
use of money were found so oppressive, that that Prince, in
order to check the evil, converted the confiscated property of
criminals into a fund from which sums were lent, for stipulated
periods, free of interest, to those who could give security for
double the amount, and a similar measure was adopted by
several succeeding emperors, f A similar measure was adopted
by Tiberius, which saved public credit, and rescued several
Roman families from destruction, when their credit was de-
stroyed, and every prospect had vanished.}: The emperor
opened a fund of one hundred thousand great sesterces, as a
public loan for three years, free from interest, on condition that
the borrower, for the security of the state, should mortgage
lands of double the value. ? The want of current money,? says
the historian, ? brought on this scene of distress.? The interest
of money at Rome, according to Brotier, was then forty-eight
per cent., a clear proof that the precious metals must have been
exceedingly scarce, for they were the general media of dis-
charging obligations. The conduct of Brutus, a few years
preceding this circumstance, also throws considerable light upon
the rate of interest, and of loans and money in different parts
of the then republic. That Roman had lent two million five
hundred thousand sesterces to the city of Salamis in Cyprus at
forty-eight percent., and, as the latter was unable to pay upon
demand, history informs us that Brutus surrounded the Senate

House with troops, under Scaptius, and kept the senators
besieged until he had actually starved five of them to death.
Of course the Roman patriot was paid.
The bare enumeration of these facts, must naturally lead
to the conclusion that the amount of the precious metals was
comparatively small, as compared to the general wealth of the
Romans, and that they must have been thinly diffused through
the different parts of the empire, although the riches of indivi-
duals were enormous, and almost beyond modern conception.
Yet, in the face of these varied data, which, to our simple
view, are corroborative of the general scarcity of the precious
metals under the rule of the Empire, Mr. Jacob* has started an
hypothesis, as to their quantity, which points in an exactly
opposite direction. That generally great authority assumes
the quantity of metallic wealth to be, in the fourteenth year
of the Empire, three hundred and fifty-eight millions of
pounds sterling, which, in the course of little less than eight
hundred years, dwindled down to thirty-three millions odd.
Had there been that sum in existence at the period spoken of,
the Romans would have possessed an amount of the precious
metals nearly equal to the aggregate quantity at present in
circulation, which, it is reasonable to assume, is the result of one
thousand times the labour, and represents more than one thou-
sand times the wealth the Romans ever could possibly possess,
wide-spread and comprehensive as were the limits of their do-
minions. This calculation rests, be it remarked, upon the most
slender basis; nor should we have alluded to it, did not the
errors of distinguished authorities frequently tend to mislead
enquirers of a different order of mind.f
Mr. Hunt, in his contribution of ? The History and Statis-
tics of Gold,? has given us an omnium gatherum of the scattered
accounts of the precious metals, whether in ancient or modern

writers, with less discrimination than we might have expected
from so able an author. We have, for instance, the statement
of Appian, that Ptolemy Philadelphus had gathered in his
treasury no less a sum than �180,000,000 sterling; and to add
to the marvellous nature of the fact, we are informed that this
enormous treasure was obtained by armed?not regular troops
?by organized bands of robbers ! Organized bands of robbers
filling the treasury of the state with booty, which they
chanced to plunder !! Again, we are informed that Pythoeus
ordered four-fifths of his subjects to abstain from digging
for gold, as his wife was ashamed at his avarice, which
sacrificed so many of their lives. Why not leave the real fact
alone, which is justly stated?namely, that ?through the want
of food he was induced to order that one-fifth, instead of the
whole, should in future be compelled to devote themselves to
those operations.? Then we have the piles of figures to which
we have alluded in the text, with the profound remark that
they ? are a curious and instructive compilation.? The curi-
osity of the compilation we admit, but the instruction it is
likely to afford we must leave to more sagacious intellects than
we have any pretence to. The Quarterly Iteview (No. 85)
elegantly remarks upon the plastic genius of Heeren, in the
course of a profound criticism of his works?? that he united
the laborious erudition of his countrymen with that animating
spirit of real genius which disposes into harmonious order, and
quickens into life that which, in meaner hands, lies in dull and
heavy masses of unintelligible, or at least, unattractive learn-
ing.?
It is, however, necessary to remark that there was a pretty
steady demand for the precious metals for manufacturing pur-
poses, both in the time of the Greeks and the Romans, especially
among the former, which steadied in some measure the violent
oscillations to which they were periodically subject. Ornaments
for the person, works of art, particularly for sacred offerings,*
? The vessels found in Pompeii do not seem to strengthen the fact of the
Romans using a great deal of gold for ordinary purposes, as they are either
made of brass or of bronze; nevertheless, we have the testimony of Roman
writers to that effect, who could not he mistaken. Sallust remarks of the


and the costly utensils of the wealthy portion of the community,
besides the ordinary demands of trade and commerce, had a
tendency to keep the value of gold and silver in some measure
steady. The pay of troops, also, was made in gold, so that
large quantities must have been in constant demand, which
prevented the ratio between the metals from diverging so
eccentrically as it otherwise would have done.
Under the Mahommedan influence gold experienced a
strange revolution in relation to its sister-metal, silver. That
prophet prohibited rings of gold, and only permitted either sex
to wear silver ornaments. In the end, however, he allowed
the fair sex to resume their gold ornaments, for they were too
resisting even for a prophet. ? Whosoever,? says Mohammed,
? likes to put into the nose or car of his friend a ring of hell-
fire, tell him to put on a gold ring; and he who wishes to
put on his neck a chain of hell-fire, tell him to put on a chain
of gold; and he who wishes to put on rings to his friend?s
wrists of hell-fire, tell him to put on golden ones : wherefore
be it on you to make your ornaments of silver.? We will
venture to suggest two reasons there were for these prohibi-
tions :?First, the prophet wished to aim a blow at the ordi-
nary pride of the rich Arabs, in order to raise himself in the
estimation of his poor and fanatical followers; and, secondly,
by melting down the precious metals, thus easily acquired,
he could the more effectually carry out his schemes of religious
reformation. To have prohibited silver would have been ven-
turing too far against the habits of his countrymen, as orna-
ments of one kind or other are dearly cherished by every class
of the Arabs, and indeed by all Asiatics. However, the prohi-
bited gold of the prophet found its way into Europe, and proved
a timely supply against the deficiency which hoarding, and the
disturbed state of affairs, had then rendered so considerable.
The discovery of America, and the remarkable circumstances
which sprung out of that event, wrought a great change in the
value of the precious metals. The value of gold had hitherto
wealthier Romans of his time, ?that the bits of their horses? bridles and the
collars on their necks were of gold, and that the covering of their backs were
adorned with gold and purple.?? Sal. Cam. 43.


oscillated between the ratios of 10 and 12 to 1, in relation to
silver, for several centuries; but the sudden influx of both
metals, upon the discovery of the rich mines of Mexico and
Peru, very soon altered their relative values. It is a singular
fact that the first importation of the precious metals into
Europe had a direct tendency to lower the value of gold and
advance that of silver, for the quantity of the former, when the
Spaniards first discovered the country, was much greater than
that of the latter : the one they found in abundance, either in
possession of the natives, which they readily exchanged for the
merest trifles, or easily procurable in the sands of the rivers,
while the other could only be obtained by labour and some
degree of skill, neither of which could be applied in their then
uncertain tenure of possession.
This fact is proved by the edict* of Isabella, dated 1497,
which effected a material alteration in the relative value of the
two metals. It may also be inferred from this edict that Spain
possessed but little gold in circulation at that period, for the
importation of the precious metal which occasioned it only
amounted to about �60,000.f The edict of Medina reduced
the relative value of gold and silver from 11 6-10ths to 10
7-10ths to 1; the former ratio having obtained for a very long
period.
From the middle of the fourteenth century, the kings of
Castille rigidly prohibited the exportation of the precious
metals, believing them, according to the political economy of
that age, to constitute the wealth of the nation. In 1480, the
Cortes of Toledo formally demanded of Ferdinand and Isabella
a stricter application of those prohibitory laws, and it was
declared highly penal to export gold in any shape, or under any
conditions. Not only bars of gold, but coined money, vessels
of gold, ornaments, and every article into which the precious
metal entered, were minutely specified. Upon the importa-
tions, however, of America becoming enlarged, it was found
impossible to maintain the prohibitive laws, although every
expedient was adopted to that end. In lieu of freely exporting

the gold, which she received in abundance, in exchange for
commodities, which would have kept down prices in her own
markets, Spain pursued an opposite course. The accumulation
of the precious metals naturally advanced the price of com-
modities, raised the rate of wages, and increased the cost of the
raw material, so that instead of being an exporting, the
Spaniards became an importing people, and gave their dearly-
cherished gold for the manufactures which their own looms
had previously produced. Labour had some difficulty in
breathing freely in the golden atmosphere which spread so
suddenly over Spain, and soon began to exhibit symptoms of
decline; and the very element which promised to strengthen
her industrial energies ultimately wrought their ruin and
decay. We must here, however, confine ourselves simply to
the fluctuations in the value of the precious metal.
It is almost impossible to ascertain the quantity of the pre-
cious metals imported from America into Spain, during the two
centuries after the discovery of that country. A rough esti-
mate is the utmost that can be achieved. Under the reign of
Charles V., the royal functionaries allowed ten years to elapse
before they rendered any account of their stewardship ; and the
records in the provincial treasury of Potosi do not go beyond
the first year of Philip 11. The statements of Moncada,
Ustariz, and Ulloa, are generally considered apocryphal; while
the sober estimates of Humboldt are treated in a similar spirit
by a modern authority, whose historical knowledge few will
question, however they may value his economical researches.*
Relying upon the statements of the Venetian ambassador,
M. Ranke is inclined to a mezzo termine position, knocking
off a few millions there, and adding them here, so as to
diminish the inflated estimates of the vain-glorious Spaniards,
on the one hand, and to adjust the too trenchant calculations of
the learned German on the other. Suffice it to state that the
quantity of gold and silver which was imported into Europe,
in one form or other, during the sixteenth and seventeenth cen-
turies, had the effect of augmenting the ratio of the two metals :

first, from 10 to Ito 14 to 1; and secondly, to keep it oscil-
lating between 14, 15, and 16 to 1, until it settled down to
about 15 to 1, at which point it has since remained.
Antecedent to the discovery of America the different coun-
tries of Europe were about on a par, as respects the precious
metals. A summary sketch of the use of gold in one will fur-
nish an insight into that of all, more or less. Our remarks,
however, apply principally to those people who were either
wholly or partially, engaged in commercial and manufacturing
pursuits. In every country of Europe, where the precious
metals were in demand, there were invariably found a class of
men who preyed upon the more simple and honest portion of
their neighbours. Nor did these ingenious men belong to any
one country, but travelled about from city to city, giving every
community the benefit of their peculiar operations. These
were your clippers of coin, your debasers, your sweaters, and
mirahile dictu? considering in what veneration they were once
held ?your alchemists. The last shall be first in our treatment
of these worthies.
The transmutation of the baser metals into gold and silver,
the chief object of the genuine alchemist, was not merely
believed to be possible, but regarded as certain, by most of the
enlightened chemists of the seventeenth century. It is even
said that Lord Bacon, the great light of that age, had some
lingering fancies in favour of alchemy,though his pure intellect,
in its unclouded moments, must have repudiated it. According
to the traditions of the alchemists, the first gold coined in Eng-
land after the conquest was produced by projection. Raymond
Lully, the facile princeps of the artful mystery, who visited this
country in the reign of Edward 1., created the gold which was
stamped in the rose-noble of that monarch. At one operation
alone, we are told that Raymond changed �50,000 weight of
quicksilver, lead, and tin, into pure gold; and, from first to last,
he furnished the mint with bullion to the amount of six millions.
We simply content ourselves with citing these remarks from
the pages of history; their value must be determined by the
reader, who will view them, we apprehend, simply as land-
marks which record the progress of intelligence, and the


gradual emancipation of the mind. The clippers, sweaters*
and debasers, must be despatched with a single observation:
show men a profit or gain, in any form, or in any pursuit, and
they will follow it in opposition to law, religion, or reason.
Wise legislation, therefore, should ever aim to diminish these
temptations to evil gain.
Ihe first gold coin, we believe, issued in this country was
by Henry 111., in the year 1257, which weighed two silver
pennies, and was ordered to pass for twenty pennies of silver.
The citizens of London, however, complained of its being over-
rated, and it was re-called. The next instance of gold appeal-
ing in the shape of coin was under Edward 111., in the year
1344; that monarch having issued no less than six gold coins:
and by the same authority we are informed* that gold was first
coined in Scotland in 1371 by Robert 11. Reverting to
England, we find that a new gold coin was issued by Henry
VII., called the Sovereign, and sometimes the rose-real, or
double rose-noble, of the value of 205.; there were also half
and double sovereigns struck for special occasions. The value
of gold in the next reign, Henry VIII., was estimated in the
operations of the mint at twelve times its weight in silver.
As the productiveness of the silver mines of America in-
creased, the value of gold, compared with silver, naturally
advanced. To diminish the oscillations which the two metals
were subject to during the last two centuries and a-half, the
greatest intelligence that the country produced has been em-
ployed, but not always with effect and success. Bacon, Coke,
Locke, and Newton, have all applied their highly-gifted and
practical minds to the solution of the difficulties which have
periodically presented themselves, in relation to the respective
values of the precious metals; and the result has been that a
temporary adjustment was rather aimed at than the adoption
of an enlarged and permanent principle of action. However,
these great lights made it much easier for those who were des-
tined to follow them; and to their 1 labours may be attributed
the subsequent and successful efforts of a Liverpool, a Horner,
a Huskisson, and a Peel.

Y6 HISTORY OF GOLD DISCOVERIES.
The following scale may not he deemed inappropriate in
this place, as it shows the alterations in the relative value of gold
and silver since the discovery of America, from 1601 to 1717
� s. d.
The act of 1717 determined that one ounce of gold was worth
fifteen ounces of silver; this was the proportion existing
between the two metals as commodities.
In the year 1774 we definitively adopted the gold standard.
The fluctuations in the value of gold, from that period to 1797,
occasioned by the first American war and the fearful explo-
sion of the French revolution, led to the famous Orders in
Council, and Bank Restriction Act, which continued till the
restoration of peace. The enormous issues of paper during
that eventful struggle caused the value of gold to rise in the
market to a most alarming height, and although the terrors
of the law were held out to deter individuals from disposing of
guineas for more than their nominal worth, the value of the
precious metal which they contained commanded as high a
price as 275. and 28s. for each. We are not writing a history
of monetary affairs, therefore shall content ourselves with
stating that the Bullion Committee of 1810, under the chairman-
ship of Horner, assisted by the sagacity of Huskisson, prepared
the way for a restoration of the currency upon a sound and
rational basis; and that the bill of 1819, with its complement
of 1844, both the productions of the lamented statesman, whose
name is in every one?s recollection, permanently fixed it there.
In order, however, to preserve the chain unbroken, which
metaphorically represents the supplies of the precious metals,
we shall furnish a few more details that may serve as connect-
ing links between ancient and modern times

duce of the Americas, from 1700 to ISIO, inclusive, was upwards of

VARIATIONS IN VALUE OF GOLD. 77
According to tlie calculations of Jacob, Europe received from the
different States of America, from 1800 to 1810, upwards of forty-
seven millions of dollars annually, which, at 4s. per dollar, gives . �9,500,000
The same authority states that from 1810 to 1821, during which
time the civil wars prevailed, the annual produce of the Americas
was sixteen millions odd of dollars, or , �3,400,000
M?Culloch, basing his calculations upon the data of Humboldt,
estimates the annual value of the American States to be upwards of
forty-three millions of dollars, or �8,700,000
Another authority * has furnished us with the supplies, from the
same source, of 1840, which only give a total of thirty millions odd, or �6,142,000
The Northern States of America?Georgia, Carolina, &c.?from
1828 to 1841, supplied an annual average of upwards of half a million
of dollars according to one authority,t while another t gives the ave-
rage of the last three years at upwards of eight hundred thousand
dollars. Taking a mean between the two, the annual supply may
. . ... �114,060
be stated as ....???? *
Russia has furnished a large supply of gold to the European
markets, since the working of her mines was placed upon a scien-
tific footing. Between the years 1830 and 1842, both inclusive, the
production amounted to 222,156 pounds avoirdupois, or thirteen
millions and a half sterling?the last three years the produce being
considerably increased.
From 1847 to 1851 the returns amount to 7646 poods, and calcu-
lating the pood in round numbers at 36 lbs. avoirdupois, the value of
the produce will be 275,256 lbs., which gives an aggregate of up-
wards of �12,000,000. Erman gives the returns for 1851 different to
the preceding, which w'ere furnished by the Russian Government to
Sir R. Murchison [ vide Hunt?s Statistics), He states that the produce
amounted to 1546 poods, which is nearly 300 poods more than the
latter returns, or �471,020 more in value. Taking the average of
their various sums, it will give an annual supply, from 1830 to 1851, of �l, 77,713
? Statistics of Gold. By Henry Hunt, Esq. Mr. Hunt makes this quantity of
dollars equal to �5,600,000, which, we presume, is a mere slip of the pen. Taking
the dollar at 45., as in the preceding conversion, and it will give precisely the
sum stated in the text. In the statements of the produce of the Russian mines,
Mr. H. appears to have been exceedingly negligent, to speak in the mildest
terms. For instance, he assumes at the outset that the Russian pood is equi-
valent to ? about forty pounds troy,? whereas it is equal to 36 lbs. avoirdupois
in commercial calculations ( Pope's Journal of Trade, article Russia ), and in the
precise demonstration which science requires, it is assumed as equal to 36 lbs.
2 oz. avoirdupois ( Murchison?s Geology of Russia in Europe, and the Ural Moun-
tains). Again, the aggregate of the five years? produce from ?47 to ?5l, is given
as 7546 poods?it should be 7646 poods. When converted into pounds troy, it
is made to equal 296,932 lbs., whereas, according to the equivalent unit of Mr.
Hunt, it ought to be 301,840 lbs. Such are a few of the laches which are pretty
thickly sprinkled over the calculations, particularly those on Russian produce,
and which, in a work especially devoted to the information of the industrious
classes, we should scarcely expect to find.

The following table, furnished by the Bank of England to
Mr. Hunt,* will be read with considerable interest, as it places
beyond a doubt the quantities of gold coined, and the sources
whence they are derived
Mr. Hunt calculates, apparently from the preceding docu-
ment, that the supplies from the United States, California, and
Australia, will amount to about �11,000,000, which, with the
supplies from other sources, will amount annually to upwards
of nineteen millions of pounds sterling. In a subsequent chap-
ter we shall enlarge upon this subject; therefore content our-
selves at present with simply collecting the necessary data for
that purpose. We cannot, however, refrain from a remark or
so upon the following sentence, which contains nearly as many
errors, as there are members composing it:?
? Howbeit, let it not be forgotten that the exportation of coin from England
is rapidly increasing, and the English sovereign is becoming every year more
extended as a medium of exchange. Formerly the Spanish dollar passed every-
where, and now the English sovereign is taken as current coin over three-fourths
of the globe; and its exportation keeps pace with the importation of raw gold.?+
Reversing the order of arrangement, we shall take the last
member of the sentence first. The export of the coined gold is
a natural consequence of the ?raw gold? imported; it simply
measures the production of the latter at the mines. Sovereigns
are in great demand to pay for the ? raw ? gold, and to pur-
chase provisions for those who have to sell it, and as long as
gold is produced in such large quantities, a corresponding
amount of sovereigns will find their way to the scene of pro-

duction. Gold-dust is not so exchangeable at the diggings for
provisions as sovereigns; nor can gold-dust purchase gold-dust,
but sovereigns can. Hence the production here is pari passu
with the production of the ?raw gold? elsewhere ; the one pre-
cisely measures the other. The gold from California would
have found its way to the United States had there not been a
debt owing to this country, which has been liquidated in ? dust
the mint of the United States, however, is as actively employed
as ours in coining the ? raw gold ? which finds its way there for
that purpose, and is equally active in exporting the coined
metal to perform the same duty as our sovereigns, both being
required to meet the demands of those who are either employed
in digging for gold, or in supplying the wants of those who are.
The next member of the sentence, which we have under-
lined, is so opposed to practical experience that it is scarcely
entitled, to a separate notice. The English sovereign is not
current coin over three-fourths of the globe, as every traveller
knows; it is not even current over three-fourths of Europe, as
Mr. Hunt may prove if he be disposed to put his corpus into
any railway he pleases on the other side of the Channel. In
Paris, Hamburg, Amsterdam, Florence, and Vienna, the sove-
reign is pretty well known by the money-changers, who give
a premium upon it in exchange, according to the rate of the
day; but if a Bank of England note be presented to those
worthies, they will give a higher premium upon it, and
prefer it to the sovereigns which it represents, and for this
simple reason?that the note is better currency than the sove-
reigns, and is more in demand for that purpose. But we are
now alluding to one or two of the great highways of Europe,
where the sovereign is partially current; let us now transport
ourselves to the bye-ways, aye, even to the general high-ways,
with sovereign in hand, and what will be the result ? A dead
halt. You will meet with a regular On ne passe pas, ?unless
some money-changer happens to be in the vicinity, which is
not frequently the case. The sovereign, in short, has no preten-
sions to even an European circulation, as every tourist, not to
say traveller, has very good reason to know, who ventures forth
without any other coins in his pocket.


Nor has the Spanish dollar diminished in circulation; it is
still the common medium of exchange throughout the Eastern
Archipelago?the only money received in payment for commo-
dities by that vast population which is spread over the Chinese
seas and the Pacific ocean. The dollar circulates, readily, at
New York and at Canton; and there is scarcely a Malay or
Javanese that is not capable of recognizing its intrinsic value.
This fact was clearly demonstrated in 1828, when a coinage of
Columbian dollars, nearly similar in obverse and reverse, hut
slightly inferior in quality of metal, was introduced by the
Americans to the Chinese markets. Suffice it to state, that
they were instantly rejected, and have long since disappeared.
The Spanish dollar, as it is technically called, is the only
coin in existence that may be said to have an almost universal
currency; and had Mr. Hunt used the term ? dollar ? instead
of ? sovereign,? we should have been spared at least a couple of
pages of manuscript. We shall point out, anon, where the
sovereign does circulate somewhat largely, or rather, where it
finds its tomb, and ceases to circulate as a coin.
From the preceding observations the following deductions
will easily be drawn :
First, that gold has hitherto steadily maintained its value
in relation to other commodities from the earliest period to the
present time.
Secondly, that all the violent oscillations in the relative
value of gold and other commodities, may be traced to causes
which have no connection with gold itself; such, for example,
as the discovery of silver in Spain by the Phoenicians, which
altered the relative value of gold and that metal throughout
the then markets of the world. The same remark may be ap-
plied to the Athenian mines of Laurion, and to the American
mines in the 16th century. In these several instances a large
and sudden supply of silver naturally lowered its value in the
market, and proportionately raised that of gold.
Thirdly, that temporary alterations in the relative value of
gold and other commodities, have principally arisen from wars
and conquests, which have a tendency to disturb or destroy the
ordinary channels of supply and demand.


And, fourthly, that permanent alterations in the value of
gold although the produce of California and Australia seems of
a highly exceptional nature, have arisen from enlarged supplies
of silver, while that of gold has been pretty steady in all ages.
The value of gold, however, has been gradually rising, in
relation to silver, for some years past, which we shall endeavour
to elucidate in a subsequent chapter. In the meantime a glance
at the productions of the Californian and Australian mines will
enable us to enlarge the basis of our calculations, and probably
furnish the required data for a satisfactory solution of the
question.
CHAPTER V.
AUCKLAND ISLES?TRIP TO THE GOLD FIELDS OF CALIFORNIA.
The following narrative is exclusively compiled from the
letters of a friend, whose racy and practical observations have
already been favourably received by the public,* and whose ex-
perience stretches over a period of fifteen years, the principle
portion of which has been spent in New South Wales and the
islands of the Pacific, in one pursuit or other. Some of the
views, especially as regards New South Wales, are different to
those ordinarily presented; and if they possess little merit
themselves, they may probably awaken suggestions in others
who are gifted with a more practical and sagacious turn of
mind.

? I had just commenced writing to you the other day, when
? spouts ? were hailed from the mast-head, the boats were in-
stantly lowered, and all hands at their post, so that I was
obliged to lay down my pen and hurry on deck to do my share
of the work. In the course of the day we had three whales
alongside, and with slight intermission have been taking them
in ever since, a better run than usual presenting itself. There
is a great deal of bustle and excitement while the game lasts,
? Perils, Pastimes, and Pleasures, of an Emigrant in Australia, &c. 1849.


and a pretty considerable amount of dirt and work after it is
over; but as I have as little as possible to do with the dirt, I
find it anything but a disagreeable pursuit. The duty assigned
to me is to attend to the ? try-pots,? and see that the oil does
not run too rapidly into the ? coolers,? which it frequently does
if not properly regulated. When this is the case, a great loss
is generally sustained, so that it is necessary to exercise con-
siderable care, and keep a steady eye upon the pots. Ere I
give you a description, however, of my recent adventures, per-
mit me to remark that I met with a somewhat curious accident
which threatened the loss of my right hand, for some time at
least. I nearly cut off two of my fingers, and have just
removed the bandage to take up my pen, but they feel so stiff
and cramped, that I can scarcely use them ; so that you must
excuse my hieroglyphical zig-zags. We had just hoisted on
deck the jaw of a large whale, measuring about seventeen feet
in length and containing a remarkably fine set of teeth, and
as all hands were more or less busy in cutting them out, I
took up a boat-knife to assist them, and commenced cutting
away like the rest. The teeth of the whale are imbedded in a
tough, whitey, and resisting substance, so that it requires
considerable dexterity of hand and knife to cut them clean out
from their sockets; and as I was forcing the knife round a large
tooth, my hand slipped right on to the large blade, which cut
my little finger to the bone, and nearly through the joint of the
next, having grasped pretty tightly the handle of the knife,
which was covered with oily matter. The wound, however,
has healed somewhat sooner than I expected, but I have no
feeling in the last joint of the little finger, and very little in
the next, for the nerve is completely divided. Nor can I move
freely the joints of either of my fingers.
? We are now in what we call fine weather, ?that is, with-
out gales of wind, under a hot and scorching sun, with a few
squalls, and occasionally rain,?and are making our way down
to the Auckland Isles, which are sometimes difficult to reach,
from the winds obstinately blowing in a certain direction for
weeks together.
? This group of islands will become, in the course of time,


nearly as important as New Zealand or Van Diemen?s Land,
although they are little known at present, from their lying
beyond the ordinary range of traders. But the case has
materially changed since the Aucklands have been made a
whaling station, and are gradually becoming the centre of
a promising and profitable industry. When I visited these
islands in 1845, they were totally uninhabited, nor did they
exhibit the slightest sign of there ever being a human
habitation upon them. The grave of a French sailor, with its
simple memento, reminds the visitor that one of an adven-
turous crew, on a voyage of discovery, is there laid low with
his mother earth, the solitary symbol of human existence in
that, till lately, lone and untenanted spot. There is now,
however, a neatly-built residence, several stores, and a number
of cottages, all of which are fully peopled by industrious beings.
These buildings are at the head of Laurie Cove, perhaps one of
the most beautiful inlets on the wide range of the ocean. The
whole of this whaling establishment is under the superinten-
dence of Mr. Mackworth, who represents a company formed in
England same years ago for whale fishing in these southern re-
gions. The number comprises about one hundred and twenty
hands, chiefly English, with a few New Zealanders, who are
allowed to remain, and who work like the rest. I came
down here in the Lord Hardwick, one of the Company?s vessels,
from Sydney, having entered into an engagement similar
to my last?as surgeon to a whaler?but with this difference,
that my services are not to be confined to a single vessel, which
hitherto has been the case.
? These islands are situate in 51� south latitude, and 166�
east longitude; they are about 180 miles south of New Zealand,
and 900 south-east from Van Diemen?s Land. The group was
discovered in the year 1806, by Captain Bristow, in the course
of a whaling voyage in a ship called the Ocean. In the fol-
lowing year, Bristow repeated his visit to the islands in the
Sarah, and took formal possession of them in the name of the
Crown; and, as a token of his visit, left on shore a quantity of
pigs, which appear to have thrived remarkably well. Whaling
vessels frequently resort to these islands for fishing purposes,


especially in the months of April and May, when the whales
go into the bays to calve. These islands are also found convenient
places for vessels to wood and water at, and where they may
easily heave down to repair.
? Port Ross is at the extreme north of the island, and con-
tains secure anchorage for vessels. From the entrance to the
head of the port, the distance is about four miles. Entering
the harbour from the north, you pass Enderby Island on the
right, the Ocean Island and Ocean Point, until you reach
Laurie Harbour, which is not visible in the line of sight, as it
runs behind the back of a small wooded peninsula, which pro-
jects into the sea. After passing Ocean Island, a ship may
anchor in perfect safety in any part, but the upper end of the
inlet (Laurie Cove), is most suitable for ships wanting to heave
down, or to undergo extensive repairs. It is perfectly land-
locked, and the steep beach on the southern shore affords
the greatest facility for clearing and reloading vessels. This
bay is encircled everywhere by elevated land, and clothed with
trees from the seaboard to the summit; the soil, of volcanic
formation, is covered with a thick layer of vegetable debris,
which produces a vigorous growth of large ferns, but which
might be made capable of producing many things of greater
value.
? Still very little is known of this interesting group, which
consists of one large and several small islands?Auckland,
Adam?s, Enderby, Disappointment, Rose?s, Ocean, Shoe, and
others. The largest island is about thirty miles long, and its
extreme breadth about fifteen miles; it contains three principal
harbours, whose entrances are from the eastward. Carnley?s
Harbour is situate in the south part of Auckland Islands;
and several masters of whaling vessels, who have visited the
island, prefer this harbour to Port Ross or Laurie?s Harbour,
highly as the latter deserve to be spoken of. Carnley?s Har-
bour is about four miles eastward of the South Cape, and the
entrance is formed by two bluff points, from which to the head
of the lagoon the distance is about fifteen miles. The passage
is about two miles wide, and generally within twenty-five
fathoms of each shore. It runs in first N.N.W., then N.N.E.,


forming at the head of the lagoon a beautiful basin, with suf-
ficient room for half-a-dozen ships to moor.
? The western side of this island is a perpendicular, bluff,
iron-bound coast, with deep water within one hundred fathoms
of the shore ; while the eastern coast is principally lined with
a pebbly or sandy beech, behind which are extensive level
plains covered with luxuriant verdure, extending back from
four to five miles, and then rising into elevated hills. The
hills, except a few of the highest, are thickly covered w r ith
trees, which seem to flourish with great vigour, and are
lofty and rich in foliage. The larger of the trees are of two
kinds; the one resembles our large firs, the other is nearly
allied to the maple, and might be usefully applied to building
purposes. The quality of the soil is indicated by the general
luxuriance of its productions; and were the surface cleared, it
might be converted either to pasturage, or even to tillage on a
limited scale. It reminded me of some portions of Van Die-
men?s Land, but very different to what I have seen in New
South Wales, except in a few isolated spots. The plains,
the valleys, and the hill-sides are covered with a heavy and
luxuriant grass, with here and there some fine specimens of
the vegetable world, little known elsewhere; the climate is
mild, temperate, and salubrious?but this is written in Decem-
ber, the most beautiful of the summer months in these latitudes.
I am informed, however, that in the month of July?the depth
of winter?the weather is generally mild, and that the mercury
is seldom lower than 38� in the valleys, while the trees main-
tain their verdure as though it were midsummer.
? On the northern parts of the island, especially about Ren-
dezvous Harbour, the hills are covered with trees of a low and
diminutive size, and so thickly intersecting each other that it
is difficult to make your way through, or even to penetrate,
them. There is also a thick growth of underwood and dwarf
bushes, intermixed with ferns, which renders it almost impos-
sible to discern the surface or nature of the soil. Moss and tall
grass cover some of the highest level spots, and a kind of grain
grows rather profusely, upon which some of the birds occa-
sionally feed; but the ground is generally dry, the water being


confined to the streams, which are not very large, hut exceed-
ingly pure. The birds are rather numerous, especially those of
the genus procellaria, which are very tame. Some of the
smaller kind are like those of Van Diemen?s Land, both in
plumage and in song; but there is one little warbler whose
plumage is black, spotted with yellow, which sang with so
joyous and musical a note that it was a treat to listen to it.
The notes of this little chorister were sometimes as mellow as
those of the English blackbird, though not so full in volume,
while at others they reminded me of the trilling melody of the
lark. This bird was the most numerous of all the songsters, and,
from the shape of his beak, must feed principally upon insects.
Indeed, I did not see a single bird with the thick, short, ham-
mer-beak of our graminivorous kind ; all were armed with the
long and attenuated mandible, which at once indicates the
nature and habits of its owner. The hawk species are pretty
thickly sprinkled among the feathered race, and seem to be
fully occupied in thinning their ranks. These sulky and soli-
tary birds may be seen in pairs, perched generally upon the
dead and uncovered branches of the loftiest trees; and, judging
by the marks along the coast, it might be safely affirmed that
their ravages were not subject to any particular restraint. The
sea-birds are exceedingly numerous on the southern side of the
island, as the fish are there in greater abundance than where
the beach is low, and gradually shelves into the water. We
saw some grey ducks, but no geese; there are, likewise, some
snipes, cormorants, and the common shag. The land-birds are
not had eating, especially the hawk, which is rather singular,
as no one would venture upon the latter in England, were he
ever so hungry. There is no species of land animal, if we
except the domestic pig, which was left here by Bristow when
he took possession of the island, and which seems to thrive, as
also the goat and rabbit, all of which find plenty of food grow-
ing in a wild and luxuriant state.
? The geological structure of the group is well deserving atten-
tion. Nearly the whole may he termed of volcanic origin. The
old formations of granite, schist, and lime-stone, have, in many
instances, been highly metamorphosed by trap, porphyry, sien-


nite, and serpentine; and where the rocks are exposed, as they
are in many parts round the coast, the quartz nature of the
veins, which more or less intersect them, would indicate that
they are highly metalliferous. In some instances the basaltic
columns rise to the height of 300 feet perpendicular, and exhibit
all the phenomena of that kind of eruptive formation ; while
the mountain, which may be said to cap Laurie Harbour, rises
as high as 900 feet, with but few undulations between its base
and the water?s edge. On the top of this mountain, and along
a considerable portion of its sides, are groups of basaltic rocks,
while below, in the ravines, indentations, and valleys, may be
seen the usual detritus of such structural formations. The
rivers are numerous and rapid, which might be imagined from
the surface of the land being rocky, abrupt, and undulating.
The islands altogether, especially on many parts of the coast,
have a picturesque, wild, steep, and basaltic appearance; but
in portions of the interior they are exceedingly interesting, rich
in soil, and capable of being turned to a profitable account.
? On the 24th of November we cleared Enderby Island, after
leaving Laurie Harbour, and were running before the wind
with a fresh breeze, which soon took us into the deep blue
ocean, and out of sight of the island. We had provisions on
board to last twelve months at least, a rather longer
cruize than the whaling craft now take, especially from the
ports which are in immediate contiguity with the whaling
grounds ; and in the event of our running short, we had only
to put into one of the numerous islands which intersect the line
of our voyage, where a fresh supply can generally be pro-
cured. The first night we were at sea it came on to blow most
lustily, as the sailors express it, and the ship fearfully tumbled
about in the deep water, which washed over us like a half-
tide rock. About midnight a heavy swell swept away the
binnacle, carried overboard the compass, knocked off our cabin
sky-lights, and poured down like a cataract into the cabin,
setting almost everything afloat. We had on board four
whale-boats ready for lowering, and two spare ones on the
skids; but the sea swept one of them clean away, leaving
neither fastenings nor davits, which were broken short off as


though they had been mere rotten sticks. We tried hard to
save the boat; but the elements were too much for us. We
then hoisted on board the larboard waste-boat, and lay-to under
close-reefed maintopsail, maintrysail, and foretopmast staysail,
till the storm blew itself out, or, in other words, till it appeared
to have become spent. For four months we cruized northward,
and encountered, almost throughout, heavy blowing weather,
rolling seas, and gales of wind, with but few intervals of fine
weather. Our success was anything but encouraging, for we
only took in five whales during the whole time. These whales,
however, were a pretty good size, and yielded a large quantity
of oil, which in some measure made up for the deficiency.
The sperm-whale is the game we are in pursuit of; the black,
or Greenland, is rarely seen in these southern latitudes.
? The first place we made was Lord Howe?s Island, which is
justly considered as one of the most beautiful and romantic
spots in the Pacific. Some parts of the island rise perpendi-
cularly to the height of 600 or 700 feet from the level of the
sea; others were so low that a gentle undulation was formed
even down to the water?s edge. We experienced, however,
great difficulty in landing. The interior of the island is richly
wooded; there we saw the tall cabbage with its graceful plume,
and the tangled fig-tree with its singularly shaped stem and
branches. The islanders were principally immigrants from
New Zealand, among whom were three Englishmen who had
married New Zealand women, who bore a pretty numerous
family to each. There we purchased pigs, goats, and poultry,
and observed that pumpkins, water-melons, onions, and cab-
bages were growing rather abundantly. The birds were not
only numerous, but displayed a beautiful plumage; and having
my gun, I killed more in the course of the day than I could
well stuff, while in a proper condition. The great drawback
to the pleasure, however, was getting back to our ship, which
in the morning lay fifteen miles off; and having to pull against
a heavy swell, it was anything but easy work. Luckily, she
had beat up nearer towards evening, so that we got safe on
board about an hour after sun-down.
? The next island, or rather group of small islets, we touched


at, was called the * Three Kings,? whose appearance was any-
thing but greeting and cheerful, for bold and rocky projections
fronted us on every side. We could not find a single conve-
nient place for landing, nor a spot on which we could venture
to push our boats, although we diligently searched all round
the group. Wanting some pigs, two boats were sent from
the ship; and after steering round the largest island, in oppo-
site directions, we were at length obliged to jump from the
boat on to a projecting rock, while one of the crew stood by to
keep the boat from bumping to pieces.
? Ascending a broken, irregular, and nearly perpendicular
rock to its summit, we perceived several of the natives, who
were quietly awaiting our arrival. On looking round, we
descried some rather fertile slopes of land; but there was a
deficiency of timber, which materially detracted from the
beauty of the scene. The streams of water, however, were
murmuring through their rocky channels, the birds were singing
a cheerful note, the day was beautifully bright and clear, and
the varied tints of reeds, tea-trees, short scrub, with here and
there a small patch of green, made up a scene so pleasant, a
landscape so enchanting, that I linger on it, even now, with
pleasure and regret. We were informed that there were only
twenty-seven inhabitants on the island, including men, women,
and children; and, according to our informant, these were
nothing more than a remnant of one of the conquered tribes of
New Zealanders, who sought, in that almost inaccessible spot,
a peaceful refuge from their destroying enemies. The old
chief, near to whom I sat down, was partly enveloped in a
blanket, and was deeply tattooed all over his face. I gave
him a pipe and a piece of tobacco, with which he seemed much
pleased, and expressed himself, in manner at least, highly
gratified. One of the natives, who had been a whaler, and
spoke a little English, made especial enquiries about the grog,
which induced us to gratify him with a slight taste of it, in
return for which he invited us to his house or hut, where
we stayed for about a couple of hours. His wife, who had a
rough mat, or Cockahoo, round her waist, in the mean time
squatted herself on the ground, and cooked some fish at a


fire, which we relished as highly as hunger and a good appetite
would allow us. We furnished biscuit and grog. Several of the
natives seated themselves heside us, and appeared as much
amused as ourselves, especially two little girls, who seemed
more timid than the rest, and who kept a very respectful
distance, which naturally excited our attention. These young
creatures gazed upon us with apparent wonder and delight, and
occasionally laughed with the usual hilarity of childhood; and
being in a state of nudity, their smooth, dark, skins glistened
in the sun, while their movements were characteristic of the
most innocent freedom. We soon left this island, as provisions
were scarce, other ships having just forestalled us. We, however,
bartered two niggerheads of tobacco for four pigs and a couple
of baskets of potatoes, although the pigs were very small, and as
wild as rabbits. One of our men exchanged his woollen shirt for
a couple of the little grunters, and managed to pull on board quite
comfortable without it. Another, in making his descent, had
fixed himself on a point of the rock, with a large pumpkin in
his shirt, and a pig under his arm, which completely paralyzed
his movements, so that he could neither get up nor down, with-
out losing his provisions; and had we not rendered assistance,
he would have lost both, for it was sufficiently difficult
to descend without being hurthened with either live or dead
stock. At length we stood out to sea for the ship, which
lay a long way off; hut having taken her hearings, and steer-
ing by the compass, we reached her in about an hour after
dark.
? Shortly after we left the * Three Kings? we made for New
Zealand, first rounding North Cape, and then running into a
small and secure harbour in Doubtless Bay, called Mungonutie,
which lies about sixty miles to the north of the Bay of Islands.
We were towed in by four boats, with six men to each boat; and,
as they were pulling all night, we endeavoured to lighten their
labour by singing songs, while they joined in chorus, and kept
time with their oars. We had scarcely anchored, however, be-
fore a canoe, with about thirty natives, came off to our ship; these
natives were all women except a chief, who had a green camlet
cloak thrown over his shoulders, a large tuft of white down


stuck rather jauntily in his ear, while his hair, besmeared
with fat or oil, hung in black ringlets all round his head.
? The Franklin, an American whaler, anchored just behind
us, and these South Sea nymphs favoured both vessels with as
lengthened a visit as they were allowed. The next island we
landed at was Mangea, where we met with similar treatment
as regards the natives and the exchanges we made with them.
After leaving Mangea we made for Whylotacke, where an
English missionary was stationed, who seemed to he ? monarch
of all he surveyed,? for the natives were obedient and submis-
sive to his will to the minutest particular. I have not space to
describe the old chief, his young bride, nor Riley and his wife,
who came out in the Camden with Williams, who was brutally
murdered at Eromango. Here, as elsewhere, we bartered with
the natives yams, pigs, ducks, fowls, turkeys and potatoes, for
boat-axes, blue cotton prints, and dungaree. I left the old chief
two cr three boxes of Epsom salts in addition, for which he ex-
pressed his hearty thanks. We intended to touch at Palmerston
Island, to take in cocoa-nuts for our live stock, as the place
abounds in fruit of this kind, which we stood much in need of,
hut hearing that some white men, not of the best character,
were on the island, we thought it prudent to decline.
? At length we put in at Oahu, one of the Sandwich group,
to obtain provisions, after a long, dreary, and profitless voyage
to the northern latitudes of the Pacific, having sought the
?field? of whales, which we heard of at Mangea, in vain.
This, however, was one of the chances to which all whalers are
subject, as we have sometimes a three month?s run, with a man
at each mast-head on the watch, without the cheering sight of
a single fish. The whale herd had apparently migrated to
the south. At this place, and at Honalulu, there are regular
stores and stations, with several Americans and their shanties,
or grog-shops, who carry on a regular business wdth the
whalers, and with different parts of the Pacific. Vancouver?s
Island furnishes them with corn, pigs, potatoes, and dried fish,
and receives in return sugar, pepper, dried woods, honey and
spices, a great portion of which finds its way to Europe. There
it was that we first heard of the gold in California, which


created the most extraordinary sensation. Every one was for
going at once, without thought or reflection, either as to the
conditions under which the precious metal was found, or the
peculiar labour required to find it. We had not been in Oahu
many days, before the Franklin made her appearance, and
shortly afterwards the Baltimore, which had been more south-
ward, and had had a better run than either the Franklin or
ourselves. As everybody, apparently, was going to Francisco,
our captain made up his mind to go also, thinking to do a little
business on his own account, and to leave just when it suited
his purpose; but he was most egregiously mistaken, for out
of the thirty-two men belonging to our vessel, there were only
three who returned, after two months absence, and they were
so ill with an ague fever, that they were almost useless.
There were, however, several other crews in a similar condi-
tion, so that the masters and captains of vessels were com-
pletely powerless. The ordinary bonds of society seemed, in
fact, dissolved, and men broke loose from their common en-
gagements, as it were, by an instinctive impulse or resolution.
Everybody took it for granted that it must be so, and remon-
strance, sense of duty, and moral right, were so completely
impotent against the over-mastering sensations which the
search for gold had awakened in the minds of all, whether
gentle or simple, that those accustomed to command, and those
accustomed to obey, were alike the slaves of an inevitable
necessity.
? Having stored ourselves with provisions, and our captain
done his utmost to turn a penny on his own account, we left
the island and steered in a north-east direction, as the winds
were blowing to that point. At length we stood in for
Menducino, a cape on the coast of Upper California, but, ere
we could reach it, the wind changed, and we again stood out
for sea, steering in a southerly direction. After a couple of
day?s fishing, with a little better luck, we sailed for San
Francisco.
? The tide was flowing in the straits which lead to the bay of
San Francisco at the rate of five miles an hour, as we entered
about midway between the bluffs which mark the north and


south points. The Narrows, as they are called, are about two
miles wide, and are bounded on the north by a range of moun-
tains rising abruptly from the water to about 300 or 400 feet;
the south, or opposite range, are not so high, but appear much
richer in vegetation, being partially clothed with slopes of
luxuriant grass. After a few miles sail we descried Bird
Island, right a-head, with its numerous occupants of the
feathered race, which had covered it with a rich deposit of
guano; while on our left appeared Angel Island, and the
Bay of San Salito, which affords excellent shelter to vessels
against the violence of the back tide. On our starboard
lay Yerba Buena, which blocks the cove of San Francisco
from view, but shelters the town from the north-west winds,
that are almost constantly blowing. The cove forms a beauti-
ful indentation of the bay, and as you pass one or two high
hills, the town and anchorage first appear in sight. San Fran-
cisco is built upon an amphitheatre, formed by the undulations
of several roundly-topped hills, which rise somewhat abruptly
from the water?s edge; and as you ascend the highest of these
hills on the left of the town, upon which the telegraph is
stationed, you are presented with a fine view of the surround-
ing country, of its peculiar features of interest, and of the dis-
tant ocean. The town at your feet shelves down to the water?s
edge; in the cove you may descry a whole forest of shipping of
every conceivable kind; and right before you is the finely-
formed island of Yerba Buena, whose sides, in either direction,
sweep down with such a gradual and lengthened descent to the
water, that they form, as it were, a base line to the arc which
the crescent of the cove presents. The summit of the mountain
is indented as though it had been subject to volcanic action,
and at a distance it assumes the outline of an extinct crater.
? Landing from our boat as well as we were able in such low
water, we walked along one of the wharfs, composed of wooden
planks and piles, which were in course of construction, and
made up our minds to turn into the first house of accommoda-
tion that we met with. At the end of what is called the cen-
tral wharf we saw painted up J, Bordon, which we soon dis-
covered was what they call an hotel. In every direction we


saw houses, shanties, and stores; while in the water just below,
and between what are called the wharfs, there were numerous
small craft in the shape of boats, barges, &c. Extending our
walk, we at length strolled into Montgomery Street, which
may he denominated the leading thoroughfare of the town.
There we observed several really fine shops, and well filled
with almost every kind of goods, more especially the establish-
ment of Burgoy and Co., at the end of the street. In Ports-
mouth Square we saw painted up in large characters Winford's
Californian Exchange, the Court of Sessions, Isaac Hall, whose
establishment we did not enter, the Union Hotel, Parker House,
Jenny Lind Theatre, Billiard Saloons, and the El Dorado, of
which we heard a great deal respecting its gambling habitues.
The Exchange Buildings is sure to meet your eye ; so also is
the important notification, that? Thompson and Hitchcock are
Managers of Gregory's Californian Express. In the corner of
the Plaza, or old square of the town, you will find the Post
Office, and next door neighbour is Stiles? Foreign and American
Newspaper Depot, which reaches very little higher than the
steps which lead to the entrance of the former. In the centre
of the Plaza you may occasionally see a picturesque group or
so, composed principally of the gaily-dressed Californian,
almost always on horseback ; of queer-looking vehicles, drawn
by oxen, and as primitive as those of the most rural districts of
old Spain; of idlers, cattle, horses, carts, and sometimes a priest,
all of which present an aggregate of a most heterogeneous
character. At Justh and Co?s., lithographers in Montgomery
Street, we purchased among other prints a representation of
the fire in San Francisco, which was not badly executed; but
the principal inducement to make the purchase was the circum-
stance of there being a lithographic press in a place just
emerging, as it were, into the first condition of civilization.
Here we had printed that destructive event in three languages,
the ? Great Fire in San Francisco ,? the 4 Grande Incendie en San
Francisco ,? and l EI Gran Incendie en la manana del 17 de
Sep., 1850.?
44 Wherever we chanced to direct our steps there seemed the
same excitement: all was bustle, activity, and rather unna-


tural hilarity. The hotels and grog-houses were crowded,
and it was difficult to obtain a single thing without a great
deal of solicitation ; while money and spirits, to use a common
expression, were literally flowing like water. The ordinary
currency of the place was gold-dust, doubloons, and dollars.
There appeared, in fact, amongst those whom we came in
contact with, a perfect indifference to money, especially to
small currency, which was left about and refused to be taken
in exchange, as though it had been of no value. Everything
betokened that money easily obtained is as foolishly expended;
and there were plenty of instances to furnish another illustration
of the familiar apophthegm, that of putting a beggar on horse-
back, and of his riding God knows where. In a French
cafe we were charged three dollars for a cup of coffee, a thin
slice of ham, and a couple of eggs; the wine and spirits being
vended on a similarly extortionate scale. The spirits, espe-
cially the brandy, were of the commonest and most execrable
quality; still, they commanded a ready sale, for men appeared
to eat and drink as though they were in apprehension of being
put on short commons for a considerable time.
? The ordinary pastime in San Francisco is gambling, which
is pursued, according to all accounts, with the most exciting
avidity. Most of the gambling-houses appear to be doing well,
and many of the leading ones have bands of music to attract
their victims, which, farcical as it may seem to a sober and
rational understanding, in general have the desired effect.
The common games are Monte, a favourite Spanish game,
Roulette, and Dice, either of which is sufficient to bring out
the fiendish element of the human heart, and to harden it into
the condition of repulsive selfishness. Having, however, a
thorough hatred of the vice in any form, not from what may
be termed a mawkish morale, but from witnessing in so many
shapes its evil results, I especially eschewed the flaunting and
showy temples in which gambling was practised, and, there-
fore, can only relate what was gathered by hearsay.
? Strolling along the outskirts of the town, we witnessed
some scenes of extraordinary richness and novelty, as regards
character. Here were pitched the several tents of the immi-


grants who were in transitu for the diggings, and such a
motley and heterogeneous assemblage it is x?are indeed to witness.
Mexicans, Peruvians, Chilians, Kanakas, Chinese, Americans,
French, Germans, Italians, Spaniards, with here and there a
sprinkling of English, were encamped right and left, and
without the least apparent design as to whom or what your
neighbour might be ; here, also, might be seen every kind,
size, colour, and shape of tent, pitched helter-skelter and in the
most grotesque forms, and literally crammed with articles, both
for sale and use, some of which would sorely puzzle any but
their owners, as to how they could be applied. Having
rambled about until we neared our boat, which was lying off
the Long Wharf, we made for the ship, about a mile out in the
bay, where we made up our minds to stay until an advanta-
geous opportunity of visiting the diggings should present
itself, which was rather sooner than we expected.
? The climate, on landing at San Francisco, is rather trying.
The sun is excessively hot during the morning; on the decline
of day the sky frequently presents an overcast and gloomy
appearance, and at night time a strong north-west wind brings
with it a heavy fog from the Pacific, which has the effect of
chilliness, and of extreme discomfort. These winds blow for
a great portion of the year from the northern regions, and, in
their passage over some thousands of miles of ocean, become satu-
rated with moisture, a portion of which is visible to navigators,
in the shape of fogs and mists, when sailing on the Pacific.
At some seasons they continue for weeks, at others for a few
days. The sun, however, is sufficiently powerful at all sea-
sons to dispel them during the day. The bread we obtained
was pretty good; the water, except when obtained from some
springs in the neighbourhood, is rather indifferent; beef,
the principal article of food, is very good and reasonable in
price; venison is equally common with beef, and bear-meat
figures in the carte of the restaurants; but of its taste and
quality we are totally ignorant. Fish are plentiful in the
bays, and, we suppose, equally so at the tahles-d'-hote of San
Francisco. Accommodation, we heard, was extravagant in the
extreme, and of the most inconvenient order; labour was out-


rageously high, and as had in quality, generally speaking, as
it was extravagant in price. Common labourers were demand-
ing from eight to ten dollars per day; carpenters and black-
smiths, the only mechanics ordinarly required, were receiving
an ounce of gold daily; laundresses demanded eight dollars for
washing your linen; and cooks thought themselves cheap at
150 dollars per month. The prices of houses and lots were
from 10 to 75,000 dollars each; and a lot purchased for a barrel
of aguardiente was afterwards sold for 18,000 dollars. A new
hotel, three story frame, about forty to sixty feet, cost 180,000
dollars, and yielded a rental of twenty per cent, per annum;
small rooms, scarcely longer than a common-sized bed-room,
were letting for 400 dollars a month, but these, it ought to be
stated, were for gambling purposes. Coined money, however,
was in great request, notwithstanding the vast influx of gold,
and realized an enormous interest.
? In fine, everything of a social nature was reversed in San
Francisco. In most civilized countries the cheapest of ordinary
things is labour; and in general it is so abundant that it can
scarcely find sufficient employment, and is seldom adequately
remunerated. As a rule, the smallest amount of talent, ac-
quired skill, or capital, elevates its possessor from the lowest,
or labour level, increases his gains, and enables him to call
the labour of others to his aid ; w'hile the highest rewards of
wealth are given to great knowledge, superior abilities, and
the best skill and cunning in the accumulation of capital.
The discovery of gold, however, has reversed this state of
things, as least as far as San Francisco is concerned. No em-
ployment yields such enormous gains as that of gold-finding,
or presents such excitable impulses to pursue it. There we
have the spirit of gambling, which is more or less latent in the
bosom of every created being, thoroughly developed, and, as it
were, justified and encouraged by a legitimate pursuit. There
the strong arm, the vigorous muscle, and the enduring stamina,
are at long odds in their favour, so that the workman who has
sufficient intelligence to break stones on a turnpike road, or
who can roll bales of goods on a wharf, has the advantage of
the profound scholar, the talented professional, the skilled


mechanic, or even the shrewd trader. In all the requisites for
finding gold the first has the precedence, while the superior
qualities of the latter are of little or no avail.
? At length our arrangements were made to visit the Sacra-
mento. On board the Rainbow, we passed rapidly up the bay,
sailed past Golden Rock, and the four rocks called the Brothers
and Sisters, into the Bay of Pablo, or Sonoma Bay. Crossing
this, we entered the Straits of Carquinez, which lead to Suisun
Bay, on the north-east portion of which the city of Suisun is
laid out, destined probably to become the centre of a great
industrial community. Monte Diablo is here seen to great
advantage, as it rises 3700 feet high, and, from recent examin-
ation, is found to contain pure limestone, which will prove
highly advantageous in building and other purposes. Into
this bay the Sacramento and San Joaquin discharge their
waters ; one from the north, through the placers of the gold
regions, and the other from the south, which also waters certain
auriferous localities. The berths in our little craft were but
few, and scarcely adapted for one third on board, so that
when night came on, half of us stowed ourselves away as well
as we could, while the others kept watch. Being accustomed
to the ?tumble-up? and the ?turn-out,? it made very little
difference to me, but to others not hardened to the service
it was anything but agreeable. This was about the first
foretaste of the ?delights and dangers? of the diggings. The
next morning breakfast, sail up the Sacramento, wild ducks
in abundance, musquitoes in myriads on myriads, and the
tule, or rush-marshes. At length, after sleeping on the banks
of the river two nights, the difficulty of pitching our tents,
the labour of ?warping? through the ?slough,? occasioned
by the rapidity of the current against us, we reached a log
cabin called Barber?s Ranche, the original proprietor of which
had been an old trapper. The heat of the sun, however, was
excessive till about four in the afternoon, when the north-west
wind sprung up and blew till ten or eleven at night, which
caused a singular fall in the thermometer, and a consequent
peculiar sensation to those who were exposed to its influence.
The sky in general was beautifully blue, and the stars intensely


bright. After a couple days more of pulling up stream, we at
length reached Sutterville, which consists of several houses
built, and in the process of building, near the river. There
were a couple of store-ships moored alongside the bank, and a
red brick house about three hundred yards distant; having
passed these, the ? embarcadero,? or Sacramento city, appeared
in view. This landing is situate at the mouth of the American
river, or rather at the junction of that river and the Sacramento.
On a plain about two miles off is the famous Sutter?s Fort. In
an old board shantie on the shore, we purchased, for a dollar
each, a piece of beef and a cup of tea, which we thought any-
thing but unreasonable after the San Francisco charges.
? Like others, we pitched our tent on the banks of the Ame-
rican, which was here partially covered with oaks and syca-
mores, and certainly a more motley group, except the one on
the outskirts of San Francisco, I never set eyes on, and could
scarcely conceive?of all nations, all climes, all tongues, all
conditions, strangely jumbled together, and mostly urged on
by the hope of gain, which reconciles apparently the most
anomalous conditions, and smooths away the most singular
distortions. On our journey up every possible enquiry was
made as to the best plan of getting to the * diggins and we
soon learned that the ordinary way was to hire a wagon and
team of oxen to carry the baggage, and to tramp it in company
therewith. As I had but little incumbrance, however, in the
shape of baggage, except my blanket, rifle, and a packet or so
of Epsom salts and quinine, &c., it appeared to me that a much
better plan might be adopted,?by those, especially, who were
simply desirous of arriving at the scene of action. I had no
intention to dig in a really earnest manner to get the gold,
therefore had made no preparation for that purpose; but if
anything turned up of a less laborious and equally profitable
nature, I could have no objection to take advantage of it. On
my arrival, therefore, at Sutter?s Fort, I looked round, and met
by accident Dr. R , whom I knew at Sydney, and who
had just returned from the ? diggins,? and was on his way
down to Sacramento. He advised me, by all means, to purchase
horse, and take the journey alone, as I was sure to pass


several on my way with their heavy drags, and who at least
would indicate the course I ought to take. I accordingly pur-
chased a little wiry brown nag, which I managed pretty well,
although he was the first I had crossed of his kind; but having
? whipped round ? in the Bush for some time in search of
cattle, and the knack of riding there being so thoroughly ac-
quired, anything in the shape of a four-footed creature can
scarcely come amiss. Suffice it to say that I reached the
Culoma Valley in about sixteen hours, instead of four or five
days, which the slow teams, in the shape of wagons and oxen,
are in the habit of taking. On my route I passed several ox-
teams wending their dusty way slowly along, accompanied
with trampers who seemed weary-worn, and, in some instances,
sad, sulky, and really tired out.
? You may imagine a camping-scene. Indians, sleeping-out,
cuyotes, staking the horses with a hair lariat, which is prefer-
able to leather, as the wild animal just mentioned is apt to
gnaw them asunder; in the morning shooting wild-fowl, or
game ad libitum, afterwards, ? with what appetite you may,?
disposing of sundry slices of fried pork, boiled beans, hasty
slap-jacks, and a cup or two of coffee, not forgetting, as a closer,
a puff or so of the fragrant weed.
? Culoma valley is about three miles in circumference, sur-
rounded by high mountains, which are nearly covered with
firs. The mountains are of igneous origin, and are broken into
ravines, which are filled with water during the rainy season.
This formation is supposed to contain gold, but the precious
metal, as yet, has principally been found in the gulches. The
basin of the valley is of common yellow-sand and pebble,
differing entirely from the composition of the mountains, whose
surface is covered with a red, sandy clay. The South Fork of
the Americanos runs through the valley; it is a perfect moun-
tain-torrent, and, in the flush of the rainy season, is at least
fifty yards wide. A few tents were scattered about the banks
of the stream ; but in the western and southern portions of the
valley there were about fifty frame and log houses, and as
many tents, the numbers increasing almost daily. Here the
find of the precious metal was considerable. Towards the


lower end of the valley, in a northern direction, stands the
saw-mill where the gold was first discovered; and Mr.
Marshall, the proprietor, we were informed, was realizing a
handsome property by merely sawing timber for the shanties
of the miners.
? The spot where the precious metal was first descried was
pointed out to us; it is about fifty yards below the mill, where
a large fir-tree extends across the stream. Here we saw some
new comers first opening shop, and supplying the diggers with
such articles as they required for the nonce. Powder was sold
at sixteen dollars per ounce; percussions at two dollars per
hundred; small belt pistols from thirty-two to fifty dollars
each; a rifle realized one hundred dollars; clasp, sheath, and
bowie-knives were usually sold at eight, ten, and sixteen
dollars; while cigars were in demand from seventy cents to
one dollar and a quarter per dozen. Gold seemed plentiful
amongst the purchasers, for they turned out the dust from their
deer-skin pouches into the scales with the greatest negligence,
as though they were not particular as to a grain or so
escaping.
? On the lower bar of the Fork, the miners were working in
the greatest numbers. There the long-handled shovel was em-
ployed amongst the clumps of bushes, or on the sides of large
rocks; there the pick and shovel worked among stones and
gravel; anon, the trowel was diligently searching under banks
and roots of trees; and the users of these several implements
were as silently working as though they were living mutes,
and the object they were in search of had completely subdued
the powers of speech. At the edge of the stream, and in it
knee-deep, other labourers were washing gold with tin pans,
or the common cradle-rocker, while the sun poured down his
hot rays upon their heads, and the water presented the opposite
temperature to their legs and feet. This bar, or placer, com-
prises the higher portion of the sandy bed of the stream, which,
during the rainy season, is covered with water, though now
entirely open and exposed, and strewed over with stones, rocks,
and clumps of bushes and trees. The gold was obtained, in
this locality, by digging through a foot of sand and stones to


a deposit of clay, partially mixed also with sand; buckets of
this material were taken down to the stream, and there sub-
jected to the usual silting process of the pan or cradle. Some
of the miners, however, dug down as low as four feet, where a
bed of blue clay presented itself, embedding, in partial places, a
large sprinkling of the precious metal. The cradles were of
all sizes, and worked, principally, with a winch-handle project-
ing from the side. The tin pan is very common, and is used in
most of the canons, as it is difficult to convey there any other im-
plement. The bars are denominated the wet diggings; the canons
are narrow openings between the mountains, some of them being
a thousand feet in depth, while the cliffs rise on either hand as
abrupt as though they had been recently wedged asunder. The
dry diggings are commonly in the gulches and ravines of the
mountains, and the gold has sometimes to be taken to a con-
siderable distance ere it can be thoroughly washed and seperated
from its accompanying matter. The white and yellow veined
quartz, which is perceptible in some spots as an out-cropping,
contains the small lumps, specks, and spangled strings of gold,
which can be picked out with a common sheath-knife, but it is
rare to obtain much in that way. The face, the hair, the brows,
the eye-lashes, and the whole person of a miner are covered
with the red sand, when working in the dry diggings; some
of the miners adorned their persons with India-rubber aprons
and used boots of the same material, but the best suit for all
purposes of mining industry is made from deer-skin, with the
common boots of fishermen.
? At James?s Town, as they call it, at the south mines, there
were about thirty huts in a finished state, and more springing
up. The bed of the river was nearly dry, and the surrounding
knolls and cliffs were covered with a dwarf fir, here and there
intermingled with small and gnarled oaks. There we observed
the usual features of mining industry ?carts, mules, and oxen;
picking, digging, and washing. At Placerville (Hanctoun)
there were about seventy or eighty wooden huts, or shanties, in
all manner of shapes and sizes. This Placerville is embedded
in a hollow square bason, whose sides are formed of rounded
hillocks of sand, which are sprinkled over with the dwarf fir.


The stream zig-zags through its centre, and there the diggers
were earnestly at work. A covered wagon, drawn by three
oxen, had just arrived with a good store of commodities, and
was eagerly surrounded; there was also another feature worth
noticing in this embryo settlement?one Albert Bee had estab-
lished a lithographic press, which could scarcely answer in
such a place.
? The most flourishing mining settlements, however, that we
observed, were those of Marysville and Downieville, At the
former we especially remarked the signs of rising wealth and
importance. On the Plaza, as it is magniloquently called, there
is the Hotel de France, the People's Hotel, and Yuba Hotel, and
in immediate proximity is the auction room of Parish and
Adams, where almost everything was disposed of. There, in
short, a whole side of imposing buildings met the eye of one kind
or other; and in the centre of the Place, several directions, nailed
to the tiunks of two large trees, attracted attention. On a couple
of large boards we observed? Plans for Damning {?) the Rivers,
and Hay for Sale; on another? Notice, no Diggins on these
Banks: and, on a fourth, in perfectly legible characters?
Apples, Oranges, and Whiskey. Board and Lodging?Now or
Never, was equally conspicuous; while on the stream, which
skirted the opposite side of the Place, a barge was hauled
half-way out of water, which announced that Martha Ruffin
supplied Teams for all the Mines, sold Groceries, intimating also
that the Taxes icerepaid, which, for the soul of us we could not
comprehend. Another boat, lying close by, was called the
Refugia for Sacramento, which was painted in good sized
letters on her sides. The ? Stars and Stripes? was floating over
the barge, and also on the roof of one or two of the buildings
on the hill.
? The general method of gathering the gold throughout all
the diggings was rather of a slovenly nature, and cannot be
called effective, inasmuch as the ?leavings? of several of the
washers would repay a more practical application of labour.
Quicksilver was seldom used, although it proves so effective in
separating the metal from its associate matter; in one instance,
however, we observed that it was employed upon the old and


wasteful plan. The quicksilver was simply poured in amongst
the black sand and stirred about with water until it was
supposed to have drawn all the particles of gold to itself, then the
amalgam was placed in a buckskin bag, and compressed with
great force, until the quicksilver oozed out through the pores of
the latter, which must have caused considerable waste. An
expert hand will effectually wash a panful of auriferous dust in
ten minutes; but the cradles are the best implements, if the
term may be allowed, as they can employ the labour of four
hands continuously. The yield of a panful ought to be in value
about a quarter of a dollar, or it is scarcely worth the labour
bestowed upon it, as a miner at that rate can merely earn about
twelve dollars per day, working eight hours. The only class of
diggers that are likely to hold out, and do pretty well, excepting,
of course, those who chance to drop on a rich ? pocket? or so, are
such as have been accustomed to heavy work, analogous to that
of mining. The frame that can endure the extremes of heat
and cold?that is not over-nice as regards diet, wet feet, mud,
water, and roughness of fare in every sense of the term,
will be the only one to endure the trying climate of California,
while engaged in such a laborious pursuit. Hard bread, salt
junk, bad water, in nineteen cases out of twenty, execrable
spirits, and the almost constant presence of a highly deleterious
atmosphere, are the ordinary concomitants of a gold-finder?s ex-
istence in these trying quarters of the globe; and the ultimate
gain, even limited to �. S. D., is not so highly remunerative,
when calculated on the average of those who are in pursuit of it.
What are eight, or ten, or twelve, dollars per day, with living
proportionately high, when weighed against the ugly incidents
here faintly enumerated ?
? The morale of the miners may be readily imagined. It
would require the deep colours of a Rembrandt to convey an
adequate notion of its real nature. Drinking to excess, ferocious
oaths, brutal threats, and in every way disgusting and degrad-
ing actions, are of frequent occurrence; and with sudden riches
in his possession, after smarting, perhaps, for the greater portion
of his life under poverty and privation?with the excitement
of brandy and wine which he could never hope to indulge in?


what could really be expected ? With the grains that fell from
the pockets of some of these men, many would deem themselves
really rich, for it was no uncommon sight to see miners rolling
about in a beastly state of intoxication, with thousands of
dollars of ? dust? about their persons, which they picked out in
payment for what they wanted in the most slovenly and waste-
ful manner.
? One word on the climate. The extremes of heat and cold
are very trying. From about nine in the morning till five in
the afternoon, the heat is excessive; the rays of the sun pour
down into the valleys and canons through a dry clear atmos-
phere without the slightest mitigation; the thermometer
generally was at 90� Fah. at noon, in the shade, both at Culoma
Valley and on the Yuba; and at night the cold in the tents, in
spite of being clothed, and wrapped up in blankets, was pierc-
ing in the extreme. In the months of June and July the ther-
mometer stands at 109 and 112 in the shade. The cold from
the mountains is excessive, and the water, after leaving its icy
source, rushes down with such great velocity, that it has
scarcely time to become tempered, ere its flow may be said to
have ceased. Fevers, dysentery, and agues, were the ordinary
climatic enemies of the miners; and these, which are incidental to
the locality, and are almost sure to afflict even those of temperate
habits, are fearfully aggravated by intemperance and excess.
The best cures are a little calomel, a slight dose of quinine, or
Peruvian bark. Some were foolish enough to try cayenne
pepper, but they paid, in most instances, terribly dear for their
folly. Epsom salts are not bad to clear the system, after
being choked up with salt meat, queer coffee, and villainous
spirits; but the best preventive, after all, is temperance in diet,
and especial care in boiling and cooling your water for drink.
? On my arrival at Francisco, after a tedious sail in a schooner
from Sacramento, I found our captain with only two men in
the ship, and they were ill, or, doubtless, would have decamped
like the rest to seek their fortune at the diggings. The captain,
however, had done a pretty good stroke of business in his own
way, which somewhat diminished the otherwise irksome and
unprofitable nature of his position, for he was in a most un-


comfortable plight, with half a cargo of oil on hoard, and the
interest of the owners of the vessel intrusted to his charge.
But as he was helpless, and could scarcely hope to relieve him-
self, he took things very quietly and made up his mind to await
the chances that turned up in his favour. Such being the state
of affairs, I at once determined to pay the southern diggings a
visit, and see with my own eyes whether the riches of the
Mariposa, Mokelemy, and Sonora deposits, were equal to the
common report. The Mariposa and its tributaries comprise a
portion of land which is reputed to be very rich in auriferous
deposits. The valley through which the river runs is about
thirty miles long, and varies in breadth from eight to fifteen
miles. On reaching Stockton, we had a further journey of
about ninety miles to make the point we were aiming at, and
where a party was established with a crushing-machine to ex-
tract the gold from the quartz. This property belongs to
Colonel Fremont, who has let off portions of it to certain
mining companies, not one of whom will have the power of
working it, unless they buy off the present settlers, for there is
no law of settlement in California analogous to that which
obtains in the United States, or in our own colonies. The first
squatter, if he thinks proper to retain his holding, is in no ap-
prehension of a law of ejectment being applied to him; and,
although the Colonel has obtained the concession of the Mari-
posa District from the United States Government, it is by no
means clear that they will enforce that grant by executive
authority. Indeed, the contrary opinion prevails, as the
government in question are too politic to enforce their authority
without the prospect of an adequate advantage, and it matters
little to them whether the Mariposa District, or any other
portion of California, be occupied by the present settlers, or by
the parties to whom Colonel Fremont may have conceded it, so
long as they perform the several duties of citizenship as recog-
nized in other parts of the Union.
? Here, however, permit me to indulge in a few geological
remarks upon the Sierra Nevada, ?not upon any one district,
but upon the condition of its general range. The snow-capped
peaks of this range suggested to the Spaniards the name which


it bears.* The geological structure of the Sierra resembles the
Andes, in being one continuous ridge, instead of a chain of
ridges, like the Appalachian range east of the Mississippi.
Granite appears the prevailing rock near the summit, and it
may be presumed that this and other igneous rocks reach some
distance down the flank of the mountain. The whole have
been elevated to their present position by forces beneath; but
the nature of these forces, and their immediate cause of action,
must be left to conjecture, or to the future demonstration of
geological science. On the western flank of the range there may
be observed large masses of metamorphic and hypogenic rocks,
which stretch from the valley of the Sacramento to the axis
of the mountain, having an average slope of 180 feet to the
mile, which gives a great fall to the streams that issue from
its side. The ravines are occasionally of enormous depths,
from the rapid and disintegrating power of the streams, reach-
* The writer of a very interesting book [The Curiosities of Industry and
the Applied Sciences, by George Dodd) has committed a strange blunder in
describing, or rather in attempting to describe, the geographical features of Cali-
fornia. He says;?? Between the Rocky Mountains and the ocean there is
another mountain ridge, parallel with the coast; there is thus formed an oblong
basin or valley between two ranges, nearly north and south; and for a distance
of nearly 600 miles, the rivers of this valley have no outlet whatever, except at
San Francis co, where a gap occurs in the coast ridge. It is thus that nature has
made San Francisco an important place, independent of the gold question. This
harbour is about in latitude 38�; the Sacramento flows southward along the
basin or valley at this point; while the San Joaquim flows northward to the
same meeting-place? the two rivers having numerous tributaries which drain the
Rocky Mountain region." So Mr. Dodd completely obliterates the Sierra Ne-
vada, and only sees on the map the Rocky Mountains on the one hand, and the
Coast Range on the other, and, consequently, makes the great basin and the
valley as one, just lying between these two ranges; and the rivers, too, as a
physical necessity, and by way of preserving a geographical harmony, are made
to flow from the greater of these ranges. Suppose, however, we follow nature,
and place the Sierra Nevada between the two ranges of Mr. Dodd, then what
will become of his geographical precision as to basin, valley, and rivers ? In
brief, the ? basin? lies between the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Nevada, and
the streams which flow through it are the Green River, the Humboldt, and the
Rio Colorado, which empties itself into the Gulf of California, while the former
take nearly the same course, though Mr. Dodd seems entirely forgetful of their
existence. The ?valley? lies between the Sierra Nevada and the Coast Range,
while the Sacramento and San Joaquim have their rise in the western sides of
this range, and pour their respective waters into the head of the bay of San
Francisco.


ing, on some of the branches of the Americanos, upwards of
3000 feet; and these streams are sometimes intersected by
smaller tributaries, which divide the separated range into
isolated groups of mountains. The features of these rocks are
generally composed of slates, protruded by hypogenes; the
slates containing numerous veins of quartz, which are more or
less metalliferous, and are the ordinary matrices of the gold.
The low rounded hills that constitute the eastern border of the
Sacramento valley, near the Bear River, are thickly covered
with diluvial drift, consisting mainly of sand and loams, mixed
with jasper, prase, basanite, and other silicious pebbles. As
you recede from the valley, the trappean variety, similar to
basalt, and of a compact structure, everywhere meet the eye,
especially on the sides of the ravines, the hills generally re-
taining their diluvial covering. From Bear to Yuba River
slates prevail, with trap protruding through them. The
quartz in this formation is frequently met with, outcropping on
the surface. These trap rocks, especially near the Yuba, con-
tain epidote, actynolite, specular oxide of iron, and also
quartz crystals. The Yuba is a perfect torrent in the rainy
season, and runs through narrow chasms, or ravines, which it
has formed in the mountains, until within twenty miles of its
junction with the Feather, where its course becomes smoother,
and its banks loosely covered with the large boulders which have
been washed down in its course. These boulders serve to
detain the sand and gravel, which otherwise would be swept
away by the periodical floods of the river, and it is principally
in these places that the large nuggets of gold are found. On
passing the southern branch of the Yuba, the prevailing rock
is trap and slate. In some instances sienite has replaced the
trap, and continues, in connection with the slate, to the river?s
edge. In the ravine of the South Fork, whose declivity is
3000 feet below the summit of the adjoining highlands, al-
luvion, with huge boulders of hard hypogene rocks, indu-
rated slates, and fragments of quartz, abound. For several
miles south-east of the Bear River, the rocks are commonly
trap and porphyry, slates occasionally intervening, with here
and there an elevated mass of serpentine, succeeded by porphyry


and trap, after which slates prevail as far as the north Fork
of the Americanos river. Boulders, ravines, strips of alluvion?
slate, trap, and porphyry?are the usual phenomena in the forks
of this, as of the preceding rivers. Here, also, is situated the
? Spanish Bar,? whose sands and gravel proved so highly auri-
ferous ; and there, likewise, is the locality of Captain Sutter?s
mill, where the first discovery of gold was accidentally made.
Columa is already a thriving place, and will become the centre
of a considerable trading community. From hence to Sutter?s
Fort there is a wagon road, which leads over the highlands.
? The same features, with slightly varying exceptions, cha-
racterize the range of the Sierra Nevada in the neighbourhood
of what is called the Southern Mines. The occurrence of
quartz veins in slate, penetrated by trap, porphyry, or other
igneous rocks, is a sure indication that the precious metal is
more or less disseminated through their mass. The Mor-
mon Gulch, for example, which proved so highly auri-
ferous, and Holden?s Garden, which was equally so, lie very
near the veins and outcroppings of the range which ex-
hibits these several features. And this leads us naturally
to the subject of veins, and the auriferous contents of the
quartz especially. The question assumes this form?will quartz
veins, as they are called, pay for working?* This ques-
tion involves one or two points which must he considered
separately. First, the character of the veins. In mining
operations, the largest share of attention has been bestowed
upon what are called ?deposit veins.? In several instances
these veins are composed of rotten quartz, which crumbles at
the touch, and may be termed a light-reddish brown colour;
but few of this class of veins are rich enough to repay the
labour expended upon them, although we must except the
Gold Tunnel Mine in the north, where this kind of quartz pre-
vailed, which proved highly auriferous.
? The general character, however, of deposit veins, is a hard
? Vide an interesting little volume, entitled the Chemistry of Gold, by J.
Scoffern, M.B. We allude more particularly to the physical properties of the
metal, and the industrial purposes to which it may he applied. There the
manufacturer, as well as the ?digger,? may gather instruction which both
may turn to profitable account.


white, yellow, pinky quartz, which occurs at intervals, and
sometimes accompanied by decomposed and honey-combed rock,
hut the quality, or rather the quantity of the precious metal, in
these veins, is purely accidental, and seems determined by no
particular law. In some few instances there is more gold than
quartz; in others the rock has yielded from 30 to 50 cents per
pound, which would pay well for working; but in many
instances the valuable contents of the veins are much below
that amount. When, however, the vein appears remarkably
rich, it soon becomes exhausted, which occasions a great loss if
it be worked throughout, as the gold is simply aggregated
upon the surface, while almost all beneath is useless rock.
The mines in the Bear Valley may be cited as an illustrative
example, to which thousands flocked, from the circumstance of
gold being found on the surface, and in the quartz, besides
pieces detached by decomposition from the vein. When the
decomposed rock was pulverized, and properly mined, it was
found to contain scarcely any portion of the precious metal.
? The mines of the north?one or two of which are being
successfully worked by companies?are characterized by a
hard, white, and yellowish quartz, which seems more spangly
than that of the south, and not likely to yield so many little
lumps as the latter. The average per ton of this quartz is
from forty to sixty dollars, and where it yields �2O per ton it
must be considered as a rare prize in quartz-crushing. Never-
theless, these deposit mines, as they are called, are extremely
hazardous.
? There is a class of veins, however, which are well deserving
of attention, and whose qualities are known to few besides
practical miners; yet these are by no means infrequent along
the range of the Sierra, especially in its southern portion. The
contents of these veins are generally coloured, sometimes red,
brown, blue, green, or grey, according as iron, copper, sulphur,
arsenic, or silver happen to prevail. These veins are often
richer below than above; for, at the surface, and even down as
low as ten or fifteen feet, they exhibit little more than common
quartz, which indicates extreme poverty. But descend a little
deeper, and the refuse quartz begins to diminish, while at a


depth of fifty feet it will entirely disappear. The ore then
assumes a dark green or brown colour, and occasionally sparkles
with gold disseminated in minute particles over the whole sur-
face of the rock; after which it remains pretty steady, and a
good auriferous extract, by the process of quicksilver, may be
obtained. The value of this kind of ore on the average is
about three cents to the pound, or six dollars per ton. These
rocks, however, like many others on the southern range, require
calcination.
?We have already remarked that the valley of the Mariposa,
which is generally considered the richest and most auriferous
in the whole range of the Sierra, is about thirty miles in length,
and from ten to fifteen in breadth. The quartz formation
appears at the head of the valley, in two great divisions, the
one dipping in an easterly and the other in a southerly direc-
tion. Both divisions disappear, but occasionally crop out, and,
after throwing off numerous tributaries, again take the form of
separate lodes. These lodes, at their out-crops, vary in thick-
ness from one to ten or twelve feet, and assume a position
inclining from the vertical to fifty or sixty degrees. Very
little of the district, as yet, has been thoroughly examined, but
quite sufficient to prove its general richness in the precious
metal. The quartz is frequently embedded in soft slate and
talcose rock. The veins vary in richness, but where the pre-
cious metal prevails, or even shows itself in its ordinary state,
they will yield by amalgamation, from thirty to fifty dollars
per ton with scarcely an exception,* although not one, as yet,
has been worked, or examined, to a depth of sixty feet.
* The veins of the Mariposa District are confirmed by an authority, whose
judgment few will venture to question. ? Two months later,? says Mr. Tyson,
in his valuable Report, ? Colonel Fremont informed me of his having removed
the outcrop from a vein of quartz, which he described as being in slate-rock near
the Mariposa river, and showed a specimen of the quartz containing gold from
the river, thus verifying the correctness of previous inferences. The specimen
consists of a fragment of angular, and not water-worn , quartz, much discoloured
by peroxide of iron, which has undoubtedly resulted from the oxidation of sul-
phuret of iron that formerly filled the cavities left in the quartz. There was a
large proportion of gold disseminated in small masses throughout the stone.
This was taken from the vein near the outcrop ; hut it will he found, in penetrat-
ing beyond the influence of atmospheric action, that the gold will he usually
accompanied by iron pyrites.??J. W.


? The quartz, in general, is extremely hard, and, after being
calcined and reduced by stampers to the required fineness,
the gold is usually found with silver, copper, iron, or sul-
phur, in small quantities. At Quartzburg, and at Burn?s
Ranche, where mining operations have been partially active,
the veins improved downwards, and fair results obtained.
In the vicinity of Sonora the veins are both numerous and
rich, but equally capricious as to their yield of gold; but the
Fortune Company?s mine, situate at the back of Sonora, the
property, we believe, of Cornish miners, with its decomposed
quartz, and its cross-thread of rich metal, has proved the
most successful. These miners are said to have sunk some
deep shafts with lateral galleries, so that they can work the
vein with some effect; but, from want of capital and adequate
machinery, the usual desiderata in the mining districts of
California, the required results have not yet been obtained.
Throughout the whole of this district the veins are imbedded
in slate, talcose rock, limestone, granite, and clays, having
almost every degree of inclination in their dip.
? The next point to be considered is the locality, which, to
be advantageous, should unite three requisites?namely, easy
access to a trading town, if for the sake of transit only, a good
supply of water and fuel, and, thirdly, as near the base of the
mountain range as possible. The first object in veins ought to
be economy in labour, and this cannot be so effectually pre-
served with mining works at a considerable altitude in the
mountain, or a distance from the nearest trading town ; and if
there be a deficiency in water or fuel, the expenses must neces-
sarily be augmented. All these difficulties may be obviated,
at least partially, by a little practical judgment, for the district
in which the gold abounds has one or two roads for convey-
ance to Stockton, and thence to Francisco; and as regards
water and wood, the first may be acquired and retained by
artificial means, which are always requisite in mining opera-
tions, and the last abounds in the plains, and on the mountain
sides, in the form of dwarf oak, or in the more valuable one
of white-pine or red-wood.
? But the grand requisite, after all, is effective machinery, if


crushing the quartz is to be carried on to a profitable result.
The machinery hitherto employed is, in general, cumbrous,
antiquated, and ineffective Neither the Mexican, nor the
Chilian mode of working ought to be adopted in California, as
the erastero and the trapiche, although in unison with the by-
gone habits of those people, are not sufficiently effective for the
present day, in a land abounding with the keenest and most
active powers of the human mind. The Mexican roller, for
instance, would have little effect upon the quartz of the Sierra
Mines, which, even when calcined, is almost as hard as the
metal the rollers are made of; the friction, moreover, would soon
reduce them to an ineffective state, as the iron is not sufficiently
tempered to endure the wear and tear of such trying work.
The Chilian mill, with its duplex movement, might prove more
effective, as revolving cylinders on the same principle could be
used with advantage, if properly constructed. The stamper is
the only machine, as yet, in general use in California; but
there is a considerable loss both of power and of gold, by this
process of crushing. As capital flows in, however, the varied
desiderata will be found, and, if capital be judiciously applied,
there cannot be a question that it will repay a more than ordi-
nary rate of profit.?
We fully agree with our friend that more skilful machinery,
such, for instance, as that used in the mines of Russia and
Schemnitz, would prove highly advantageous in California.
But this kind of machinery can only find its way to the mines
when the ?placers? and ? diggings? shall begin to diminish,
and labour finds something like a natural level. Capital and
labour cannot be applied upon anything like a healthy and
enduring principle, so long as the present condition of things
shall last, which partakes more of the spirit and excitement of
gambling, than of a permanently remunerative, and steady
pursuit. The machinery in ordinary use in the Siberian mines,
and that employed in the mines of the Ural, could be effectually
used in California, as the general detritus and rocky materials
of each, correspond in almost every particular. Walker?s
cylindrical sieve, for instance, so efficiently used in the Ural
mines; and the sorting-drum employed at Schemnitz, which


separates, by a simple arrangement, four different sizes of
materials, so that by a two-horse power, and the labour of
a couple of men, ten or fifteen tons of mixed ore and stones
can be operated upon in a single day.?Again, there is the
ingenious gold-washing apparatus of Agte, in use at the mines
of Alexandrowsk, which, with the aid of four men, employed
in ? charging? and ? picking,? will operate upon thirty or forty
tons per diem.
We cannot, however, condemn so unceremoniously the
Chilian trapiche, which, in the absence of the skilled machinery
just mentioned, might be effectually used in California; and,
though our friend may hold it as the lowest amongst skilled
machines, it unquestionably occupies the first place amongst
comparatively unskilled machinery. Let us describe the ma-
chine in question : ?the trapiche, or mill, more properly
speaking, is of a very simple construction, and comprises
two stones, the lower stone being placed in a horizontal and
the upper in a vertical position. The horizontal stone is
about six feet in diameter, and has, near its circumference, a
groove of eighteen inches deep, in which the ore is placed;
through the centre passes a perpendicular cylinder, connected
by a cog-wheel, turned by water. The vertical stone is about
four feet in diameter, and ten or fifteen thick: and is fur-
nished with a horizontal axis, which permits it to turn freely
within the groove. When the ore is sufficiently pulverized, a
proportionate quantity of quicksilver is added to it, which is
immediately amalgamated with the gold; to moisten the mass,
and incorporate it more fully, a small stream of water is
directed above it, which also serves to carry off the amalgam
into reservoirs, placed beneath the stone. The gold combined
with the mercury falls to the bottom of these reservoirs, in the
form of whitish globules; the mercury is next evaporated by
heat, and the gold appears in its true colour, and in all its
brilliancy. In each of these mills upwards of two thousand
weight of ore can be daily ground and amalgamated. This
mode of extracting the metal is simple and effective, but, of
course, must give place to the skilled devices of the present
day.


One word, ere we close this chapter, upon the weights of
the different lumps found in California, and also upon the an-
nual yield of the diggings and mines, which is naturally at-
tracting much attention.
According to certain statements, no doubt greatly exaggerated,
there have been found lumps of gold of the respective weights
of ninety, fifty, thirty, or twenty pounds troy; but whether
these were solid native metal, or had been produced artificially,
by melting up quantities of the gold, as ordinarily met with,
or whether they were pieces of quartz, containing fragments or
scales of gold, we are left in the dark. We have before us the
returns of the United States Mint, which gives the following
statement:?
By Lieutenant Beale, .... 6 lbs. 9 oz. troy.
Mr. Mickle, . . . . . 9 ~
Mr, Perkins, . . . . . 14 ? 6
Mr. Post, 5 ? 7
For the sake of comparison, the weightof large lumps hereto-
fore found in other parts of the world are given as follows :
At La Paz, in Peru, . . . . 59 lbs. troy.
In Sonora, Mexico (Humboldt), . . 48 ~ 6 oz. ~
In Siberia, (do.) . . 27 ~ ?
In Cabarras Co., N. Carolina, . . 28 ? ?
Do. do. . . 13 ~ ~
To which we may add the lump recently found by Mr. Kerr,
in the Turon Diggings, New South Wales, which is reported to
have weighed 110 lbs.
The composition of the gold of California, as compared with
the productions of other mines, is thus stated in the document
to which we have referred :
Maximum. Minimum.
California, ..... 95?70 BP2O
Siberia, ..... 98 - 96 28
South America (New Granada, &c.), . 88 - 58 64'93
The Mint returns, as to the quantity of gold received for
coinage, furnish some interesting data, which will serve to
elucidate the question as to the productive power of the
mines;?

A foot-note is appended, stating that ?the total amount
received, from the discovery of the mines to October 31, 1850,
was 31,838,079 dollars. The deposits of the current month (No-
vember) will probably advance the total to thirty-six millions.
The San Francisco Herald of the 15th June, 1852, gives the
following statement of the quantity of the precious metal
shipped from California, which presents some curious features:
The total shipment for June will give, for the first half of
1852, 19,281,448 dollars. This is at the rate of 38,562,896
dollars for the year. During the year 1851, the deposits of
Californian gold at the Mint amounted to 55,938,232 dollars,
being 17,375,336 dollars more than the sum estimated for the
present year. In a subsequent chapter we shall indulge in a
remark or so upon these returns, which may probably serve a
useful purpose. In the meantime, we shall resume the narra-
tive and correspondence of our friend.
CHAPTER VI.
TRIP TO THE GOLD FIELDS OF AUSTRALIA.
? Launceston, March 15, 1852.
? I shall now briefly transcribe certain portions of my diary,
in order that you may have a glimpse, as it were, of my move-
ments since I last wrote you.
? Left San Francisco with a motley crew, principally Kana-
kas wishing to get to the Sandwich Isles. Some Sidneyites on
board, eager to reach their homes after ? prospecting ? in the
Californias for the precious metal. Few successful; two had


about sufficient to carry them to Sidney; one offered to work
his way, and did anything that was required of him. Not
many, from what I could see and hear, had realized their ex-
pectations ; nor was it to he expected, for thousands started to
pick up gold, as though it were lying at their feet and simply
required the bending of their bodies, little thinking that a
considerable amount of labour?and labour, too, of a peculiar
kind ?is absolutely necessary to procure it. It appears to
me, from what little I have seen and heard, that all the
lazy, floating, ill-to-do fellows, in almost every part of the
world ?who all but starve in their own country ?thought they
should make amends for their comparative ill-luck, as they
term their unsuccessful condition in life, by rushing to the
gold-fields, and by securing sufficient means to make up for their
preceding short-comings. There is, however, a physical,
educational, and practical adaptation for almost every pur-
suit in life, and the very parties who seemed deficient in
these several requisites were the first to embark in a pursuit
which, above all others, required their peculiar application,
and without which failure is almost inevitable. Gold-
finding, least of all industrial pursuits that I am acquainted
with, is no exception to the universally recognized rule ?that
there is no royal road to geometry. As they say in our law
courts, in allusion to the prizes to be gained, ?many are
callen, but few are chosenand if the remark holds good
as regards the students of law, it is equally applicable to
the generality of the gold-seekers. Mere luck, as it is vul-
garly nick-named, must be excluded in calculating the results
of such industrial pursuits, if, indeed, it ought ever to be ad-
mitted as an element in the solution of any industrial problem;
then it will be found, unless we are greatly mistaken, that the
successful gold-finders may be ranged under two simple cate-
gories?those who practically and energetically apply their
labour to the pursuit, and those who shrewdly speculate on
duly supplying their various wants.
? Beached the Sandwich Islands after considerable southing;
heard, for the first time, of the gold discovery in New South
Wales. Great excitement. Everybody wishing to go on board


our vessel. Consideruble difficulty to find hands to work the
vessel. At length reached Sydney. Discharged our cargo of
oil. No hands to work the vessel down to the Aucklands. All
olf to the ? diggings.? Arrival of one of the company?s ves-
sels, the Samuel Enderby, from the Aucklands, with craters,
shovels, iron bedsteads, pumps, railway bars, and wagons,
wheels, &c., all of which are required in the plant of a whale-
fishing station. She had on hoard upwards of a hundred casks
of sperm, seal, and common oil, besides seal-skins. Surprised
at a portion of her cargo, as it denotes a foregone conclusion.
Mr. Preston, the secretary, had arrived out from England, and
was down at the station ******
This, however, I do know, that there is scarcely a good field of
whales to be found there, taking the season round. The ? fish ?
come higher up, where they are to be found in much larger
quantities. Besides, it is difficult to get near the Aucklands
for about nine months in the year, the winds blowing so
steadily in a contrary direction, and with such a dead ? set ?
against the islands. It is no uncommon thing for a vessel to be
right off the port for three weeks together, without even a chance
of making the slightest approach to an entrance. Regret the
turn that things have taken. Great desire to revisit the
Auckland group, if it be merely to re-examine their geological
features. The sketch I sent you corresponds exactly with the
structural formation of several parts of Sierra Nevada, and I
have not the slightest doubt but gold will be found there, the
same as elsewhere. I have written to the secretary, Mr. Preston,
to that effect, although I have not the pleasure of that gentle-
man?s acquaintance. ******
If gold be discovered in the Auckland group,?which may
be affirmed with almost the greatest certainty, ?it will doubt-
less have the effect of determining their continued occupation,
whether profitable for whaling purposes or not.
? Met my old friend B , who kindly invited me to his
residence in the Shoalhaven district, where he has one of the
finest and largest establishments in the colony. He seems much
aged since I saw him nine years ago. Is still a Member of Council,
and, with the exception of , is considered one of the


most shrewd and practical minds of that body. Determined
upon going by sea to Wollongong, though a little out of my
way, as there is a good road from Sydney to the Shoalhaven
district, through Campbell Town and Bonghong, leaving Appin
on your left. On my visit to Wollongong nine years ago, I
went by way of Appin, and through the bush, after crossing
the Nepean barefooted, as there was not even a ford across
the river at that time. Since, then, however, the authorities
have mended their ways, although there is yet wanting a direct
road to the Illawarra district, perhaps the most beautiful and
productive of any in New South Wales.
?On board the King William steamer,?a little, cranky, and
ill-conditioned tub of a boat. Left Sydney at 4 p.m., and reached
Wollongong?the Brighton of New South Wales?next morn-
ing. Bad harbour, ?difficult to approach; a great drawback to
the prosperity of the place. Steamers are continually plying
between there and Sydney, but the surf in general heats so
heavily against the shore, that they are sometimes obliged to
return without their cargo of live stock even landing. Walked
round the town, and found it much improved since my last
visit. Great number of public-houses for the size of the place,
but chiefly dependent upon the settlers of the district, who
make this a meeting for the sale of their cattle and the
purchase of their commodities. The ? Marine? had supplanted
the ? Royal? Hotel, as the leading place of accommodation, and
instead of one Dillon, a tipsy Irishman, rejoicing in the occupa-
tion of landlord, I found a well-to-do Englishman, with a buxom
wife and three or four rosy children to boot. The accommoda-
tion of the establishment was equally metamorphosed; in lieu
of sleeping on an old sofa with a dirty towel to besmear your
face with in the morning, you are provided with the cleanly
comforts of an English country inn, and by no means at an im-
moderate price. Inquiring for my old friend, the Rev. Mr.
M , I found that he had paid the debt which we all owe,
and which nature will require of us all one day or other. Peace
to his soul! M was a kind-hearted, hospitable, and truly
Christian priest; and well do I remember, nine years ago,
acting as clerk for him, when he went to preach his monthly


sermon at the establishment of my friend B , the first, and,
in all probability, the last time that I shall assume so sacred a
vocation.
? A good day?s journey to Shoalhaven. Tramped it right
merrily through a line of country of rich and varied wildness
?flats, rivers, hills, tall trees, and tangled brushwood, alternat-
ing the scene. Nature is there arrayed in all her glory, and most
luxuriantly displays her charms. The Banksia ?l must give
you a passing whiff of the flowers, imaginary though it be?
with its orange-red cone, perfuming the air with a scent as
delicious as that of the honey-suckle ; the Xanthorea, or grass
tree, with its sooty-coloured trunk, and its long, pendulous,
thickset tuft of grass, from the centre of which springs a stem
several feet in height, which is covered with small, delicate,
white blossoms; and the Cabbage-tree, with its bright yellow
and red-tinted flowers, profusely scattered over the foliage, and
which, at sun-set, glitters like a mass of molten fire. Then
there were the Kennedies, purple and red, climbing here, there,
and everywhere; the Arrogosanthus, with its velvet-like, ruby
stem, and the white, pink, and gold-tinted Xeranthema,
peeping up in almost every direction, with their peculiar forms
and their rich and brilliant hues. The birds?the stillness ?
the almost breathless quietude, and my utter loneliness, are
left for you to depicture at your own convenience. Passed
through Dapto and Jamboroo, and reached at length Kiama,
which has grown into a pretty village; visited the crater of
an extinct volcano, which the ocean, by encroaching on the
land, has converted into a magnificent water-spout ?a beautiful
sight, and worth lingering awhile to look at. Reached Jerin-
gong, which is still an inconsiderable village; then made my
way over a rocky and winding country, which was thickly in-
tersected with wood of singular richness and variety, and at
length came out upon the sea-coast. Taking off my hoots and
stockings, and carrying them in my hands, I trudged along the
beach for seven or eight miles, where the sand and the spent
surges of the ocean proved a cool and agreeable carpet to walk
upon.

oldest settlers, and has accumulated a large property. Two of
his brothers, and three of his sisters, followed him from Scot-
land ; they are all in a flourishing condition.
? Launceston, March 1852.
? After leaving B , whom I accompanied to Sydney, I
took ship and came down here on a visit to our old friend
G ?, who is carrying on a large and thriving business as a
soap-boiler and can die-maker, and who bids fair, in the course
of a few years, to become what is called a ? man of substance.?
But he has recently received a severe check, like many others
who are dependent upon a steady supply of labour, which, to
use a nautical phrase, has completely taken the wind out of his
sails, and which, if it does not spring up again pretty quickly
from the same quarter, will leave his little craft high and dry
on the sands. There is but slight hope, however, at present
that such will he the case.
? The fact is, that the recent discovery of gold at Bathurst
and Mount Alexander, in the Victoria district, New South
Wales, has completely turned this colony topsy-turvy. Laun-
ceston is almost deserted. G ?s men left him in a batch,
although he was paying them from two to three pounds per
week; three of them, moreover, had been with him upwards of
eight years. The head boiler actually left a pan of soap half-
made, and consequently useless, so anxious was he to be off
with the rest, though a remarkably honest and industrious
man up to the time of his running away.
?As G ?s men had all left, and as he had no chance of pro-
curing others, although he advertised in the ? Cornwall Chro-
nicle ? repeatedly, and offered advanced wages, we made up our
minds to visit the diggings, so soon as we had set matters a
little straight. It being summer time, too, (November), he had
plenty of stock on hand for his trade, which could easily be
attended to by his uncle, who is too old and too well off, to be
influenced by the general excitement which so violently seized
hold of the public mind. We accordingly put ourselves on
board the boat which sails weekly to Port Philip, and arrived
there in due course, for the Van Diemeners think no more of a


trip across the Straits?a distance of 600 miles?than you would
to Margate or Dover. In fact, they look upon the province of
Port Philip as an adjunct of their own colony, having been the
first to plant their flocks and herds in that settlement, ?or, in
other terms, as being the founders and settlers of that province.
Most of the Launceston people have either brothers, sisters, or
partners, both commercial and matrimonial, in some part or other
of the Port Philip district, and several own a good portion of the
property which has there so suddenly sprung into existence.
In making the trip, therefore G had two objects in view;
first, he was desirous of seeing the precious metal picked up, as
I had described it; and secondly, he had contemplated a visit
to Melbourne for some months, in order to complete a negotia-
tion which he had on foot ?namely, the purchase of a boiling-
down establishment near that city, wherein 1200 sheep per
diem were boiled down. Circumstances highly favoured the
first object; but there was little prospect of the latter being
realized, as there could be but a slight chance of procuring
labour in the immediate neighbourhood of the prevailing ex-
citement, when it was not procurable at 600 miles distance for
his more immediate purposes.
? Stopped at Melbourne a couple of days. Lodged with
Dr. Motherwell, Collins Street, a friend of G ?s, Visited the
boiling-down establishment on the Yarra River, about three
miles from the town. Nothing doing: all off to the diggings.
Not even a servant of any kind to be got. Butchers in great
demand, especially pork-butchers, who can earn as much as five
pounds per week. Carts selling at fifty pounds a-piece, which
a short time ago were not worth fifteen pounds; everything of a
mechanical structure, and of a useful nature, excessively high.
Off to the diggings. Reached Mount Alexander in a couple of
days; the distance about eighty miles from Melbourne. Horsed
it all the way ; nothing but a blanket in the shape of luggage,
besides a couple of shirts and half-a-dozen pair of stockings,?
for, let me remark, there is nothing so conducive to health,
especially in this climate, as clean and cool feet .-?a luxury?
indeed a decency?everywhere ; here, in addition, an absolute
necessity ; so also I found it in California. Nothing like


grooming the corpus well from top to toe; dry friction is
always practicable, when anything in the nature of a liquid
cannot be obtained. A cool head, a mildly-toned stomach, and
a moderately warm foot, with free perspiration?there is then
little chance of physical ailments, but everything in favour of
healthy and exhilarating enjoyment.
? What a sight! G perfectly bewildered for a moment
or so. There they all are as busy as ants, and as silent as though
they belonged to a dumb generation. Cradle-rocking?tin-
washing?horse and cart and wheelbarrow?in short, every
possible expedient for diminishing labour ?was rudely hit upon
and diligently applied. Provisions not so dear as might be
expected. ? Mutton or beef? is the common cry in the morn-
ing by men who drive their carts down the diggings, and,
being plentiful in the neighbourhood, is sold at moderate
prices. Flour, 6d. per lb.; butter, 2s. 6d.; milk, Is. a quart;
potatoes 3d., and cheese 2s. 6d. per lb.; and Is. for a very
small quantity of brandy. Tea, tobacco, and sugar moderate,
considering all things.
? Strolling down the Creek, called Friar?s, which is about ten
or twelve miles long, G stumbled upon his head boiler,
who was as busy as a bee, with two or three others of the
Launcestoniaus. As soon as the man caught sight of his master
he slunk away; but, seeing the latter familiarly talking with
his companions, he sidled up and began to manufacture some-
thing in the shape of an apology, which G cut very short
by remarking?' The least said the soonest mended; you are
not the only one by a great many who have run away from
their work,??and thus made a virtue of necessity. ? Have
you seen Mr. V , sir?? exclaimed the man. ?No,?replied
G : ?ls he here ? ? ? Oh, yes, sir, he?s somewhere about,
if he a?int on his lot higher up there. I spoke to him about
an hour ago.? ?Where?s T ?? ?He?s very ill, sir; he?s
lying under the tent. I ?ll show you, sir.? We accompanied
the man, and found his companion in a state of high fever,
which no doubt had been brought on by excitement, drink,
irregular hours, and sleeping too exposed. Gave him the
usual dose?nothing like it?quinine, &c.


? Gold pretty equally distributed; easily found, but not,
apparently, in great quantities. The aggregate findings may,
however, make up a large amount. The metal is mostly found
in a bed of blue clay, which is superposed by quartzy pebbles,
red and yellow clay, earth and gravel. Pits dug to the depth
of eight, ten, and twenty feet, to arrive at the clay; the super-
incumbent strata being pretty regular in the several creeks
and bends of the river. Little, as yet, found in the rocks; the
diggers being too busy in the alluvial deposits. One quartz
vein above Friar?s Creek has been worked for a few yards in
the rock, but was not found so profitable as the beds and inden-
tations of the Creek. One of the pieces, previously referred
to,* was from this vein; the other was struck off the rock a
mile higher up. The gold is generally diffused in the one,
although the spangles are small ; in the other there is no
trace of the metal, yet both are apparently of the same struc-
ture, and clearly of a metamorphic origin. The gold, it is fair
to assume, will not prove so plentiful as many people are
sanguine enough to expect. The prevailing character of the
rocks, in the immediate vicinity of the range, consists of iron-
stone, or indurated clay, with a large admixture of iron, and of
sandstone coloured with iron, resting on granite. The granite
and schists alternate with each other, and present in their dip
an angle of inclination of about fifteen degrees. In some few
instances could perceive the outcroppings of the metamorphic
series, especially those of porphyritic structure, but the veins of
a quartzy formation are not so predominant as might be antici-
pated. The sides of the creeks clearly indicate their formation,
and exhibit the structural nature of the range; the disintegra-
tion of the silicious and quartzy materials has let loose the
precious metal which they contained, and which has found its
resting-place either in the beds of the water-courses or in the
cleavage and fissures of the rocks.
? One word or so on the physical character of Australia,
which will enable you to form something like a correct opinion
of her ultimate development, and the extent of the means
required to carry it out. The great and insuperable drawback
? Vide p. 28.


is want of water. Where rain falls only at one season in any
quantity, and where during the rest of the year evaporation is
constantly going on under the influence of a cloudless sky and
a brilliant sun, there cannot be expected rivers of any magni-
tude, or tributary streams with a continuous flow of water.
Irrigation, therefore, is out of the question, at least upon a scale
adequate to supply the exhaustive powers of evaporation,
which may be termed a constant quantity in Australia, as
there are no physical agents to counteract and neutralize its
effect. A great portion of the surface of land in Australia must
ever remain in a barren state?just as much so, indeed, as the
arid plains of India are, and from precisely the same cause.
The tanks which are formed on the surface of the latter afford
but a scanty supply of water for the purposes of irrigation,
although the sums expended annually for keeping them in a
serviceable state, irrespective of the cost of their structure, are
very large, and prove a heavy item in the burdens which land
has to bear in that country. The outlay of capital must be
equally heavy in Australia, if, indeed, it were not more so, ?
for the droughts in the latter are more frequently recurrent
than those which occasionally depopulate India; and experience
has proved that the Macquarrie, which intersects so large a
portion of the present settled districts of New South Wales, is
more capricious in its periodical supply of water than the
Ganges, for although the latter may fall below its usual level,
and leave the plains of Bengal in an unproductive state once
or so in a quarter of a century, the former is liable to present
the same state annually, and is occasionally destitute of water
for two seasons consecutively. Nor is this condition of water-
supply in Australia confined to a single stream, but, if we
except the Murray and the Shoalhaven, it is characteristic of
them all. Cultivation, therefore, must be confined to the
valleys and to the lands adjacent to the water-courses, which
can only form in Australia, as elsewhere, but a comparatively
slight portion of its aggregate surface ; and when these portions
become fully cultivated, and adequately peopled, it will be
found that the anticipations of the whole land being covered
with a thriving and populous community must he classed with


the Utopia which practical experience, guided by economical
science, especially discards.
? The deduction, Therefore, may he fairly drawn, that where-
ever water is deficient, there also must be restricted cultivation
and a limited population. Take North America as an example.
If any one had whispered in the ears of the first settlers on the
sea-board of that great continent, who died off like rotten
sheep from the effect of the malaria, or miasmatic condition of
the land, something like the following??that they ought to
think themselves extremely fortunate in being placed in the
midst of such rich and invaluable elements as produce fevers
and ague, which required little more than industry and perse-
verance to convert them into elements of a highly beneficial
nature; that the great basin of the Mississippi, upon whose
fringe they were located, and of whose unhealthiness they so
bitterly complained, would, with its rich diluvion, one day
become one of the most flourishing, healthy, and highly-
cultivated spots on the face of the globe?that, moreover, it
would prove sufficiently productive to supply the great manu-
facturing staple of England, and, in short, that the industrial
fabric of the latter would be mainly dependent upon it,??how
would those settlers have replied ? ? Mad, sir, mad as a March
hare !? would in all probability have been their reply, and they
doubtless would have considered their prophetic communicant
entitled to a free admission for life to a lunatic asylum. Never-
theless, such has proved to be the case ; for when the price of
raw cotton happens to rise a penny or so per pound, it frequently
results that some thousands of hands are thrown out of employ-
ment in the manufacturing districts, and a consequent shaking
of the whole industrial fabric ensues. England is mainly
dependent upon America for the supply of the raw material
which forms the basis of her gigantic industry, and America is
indebted for this richly producing power to the affluence of her
streams and the abundance of her supplies of water. It would
be folly, or something worse, to make these observations to the
present settlers in Australia, or to predict that she will become
the exclusive source of supply of any single material for the
manufacturing world some two hundred years hence, as


circumstances fully prove might have been made to Ame-
rica. Australia will mostly be confined to pastoral pursuits,
which must keep her thinly populated, and limited in the
production of wealth. In a country where it requires three
or four acres for the sustenance of a single sheep,* and where
the plough would be comparatively useless, it surely is not rash
to affirm that the accumulation of wealth must soon arrive at
its limits, and beyond that limit by no effort can it possibly go.
Twenty or thirty thousand immigrants, at the utmost, would
have been sufficient to supply the demands for labour, and, had
immigration been confined to that limit, the prosperity of the
colony would have been of a more healthy and enduring nature
than can possibly result from the sudden and overwhelming
flush which is now pouring into it from all quarters of the
globe. Gold-finding will rapidly become an unprofitable
pursuit, from the numbers who are rushing into it, and when
those who are incapable of obtaining a livelihood in that
way are thrown upon the ordinary industrial occupations
of the colony, the supply of labour will far exceed the de-
mand for it, and misery and destitution to thousands will be
the result.
? But the most tender point in relation to Australia is the
origin and structure of her social condition. The least said,
perhaps, upon this subject, the soonest mended. New South
Wales, however, may be said to be in a metamorphic state ; she
is casting off by degrees her old skin, and is quietly growing
into another of a somewhat more healthy and wholesome con-
dition. The mother-country ought not to throw her back while
under such an interesting state of transition.
? The first stage of the present colony has been compared
with the early state of ancient Rome, in which the community
? Count Strzelecki remarks (Physical Description of Nexo South Wales )
? that at least seven acres of pastoral land are necessary to maintain a sheep of
the value of two shillngs, and which, on an average, produces but two pounds
and a half of wool.? The Rev. D. Mackenzie, in his Ten Years in Australia, ?
a work abounding in practical information as regards the physical properties of
the colony?says that, ?by those settlers who have expressed the most unfa-
vourable opinion of the capability of our pasture for grazing purposes, three
acres have been allowed as the fair average for the support of one sheep.?


was nothing more than an association of robbers and outlaws,
but, there is this remarkable difference to be observed between
them, the robbers and outlaws of ancient Rome were independent
and free, while those of New South Wales were in a state of
slavery more rigorous in principle than even a negro slavery in
the West, because the labour and submission exacted from them
was not merely considered by their masters as a right, but as a
punishment also, which it was their duty to render effectual,
both for retribution and correction. The great blunder com-
mitted in the outset was in endeavouring to construct a com-
munity of felons alone, which was to be continually increased
by fresh accessions of convicts. The machinery of government,
even in its most simple and orderly state, cannot be carried on
without hands, and much less in a state of society almost ex-
clusively composed of unruly spirits, who are to be kept under
rigid surveillance and coercion, because the local government
had no alternative but to select from this very class nearly all
its subordinate functionaries. Public works were necessarily
filled up by those convicts whose better education only ren-
dered them the more dangerous as confidential employes. The
frauds and robberies practised upon the government formerly
were most enormous and audacious; and some of the largest
fortunes realized by the emancipists , or their descendants,
have no other origin but this. When the tide of free emigra-
tion set steadily in, about thirty years ago, the government w T ere
enabled in some measure to keep the felon population at arm?s
length ; but the class to which I allude had acquired, as a body,
great wealth, and became inflated with extravagant preten-
sions, so that the organization of such heterogeneous elements
as the colony presented, defeated the most skilled and practical
plans that could be devised. Nor, unfortunately, was the as-
signment system, which was now bi'ought into full vigour,
however well calculated in other respects to promote the pro-
gress of the colony, calculated to check the growth of the evil
to which simple allusion has been made. In fact, it was through
the facilities which existed of abusing the assignment system
that transportation, instead of conducting the malefactor to a
place of punishment, only opened for him a road to fortune;


and that we at this day witness the anomaly of the opulence and
luxury of a rising colony being represented by a class, which
our criminal legislation had intended should reap nothing from
their labours in it, but privation and disgrace.
? Recent events, however, have once more stirred up from
their depths the ugly elements which we have fully pointed
out, and which were fast sinking into a state of comparative
quiescence ; the colony has nearly passed through the fiery fur-
nace of felonry, if we may be pardoned the phrase, and it is
now threatened with the renewal of the evil, although upon a
smaller scale. The mother country, in short, is prescribing a
homeopathic dose of the drug, which, formerly, w 7 as taken
wholesale; but as the stomach of the patient thoroughly re-
fused it in that shape, it is not likely that it will receive it in
any other, however modified it may be in quality or taste.*
? A word or so to the immigrants. Whoever comes to this
new world, if he means to succeed in it, must resolve, in a great
measure, to become a new man. He must make up his mind
to dispense with most of the indulgences, and to discard from
his memory most of the conventionalities to which he had been
accustomed, and to reconcile himself to the simpler pleasures,
and the ruder manners, of a more primitive life. The man
who can thus break through old habits, and divest himself of
old social prejudices, is crowned with a force of character which
?would enable him to make his w T ay anywhere, and in Australia
will certainly carve out for himself a sure, though somewhat
rough, road to fortune. You, for instance, considered as an
immigrant, may be classed as a capitalist; but you would make
a very great mistake if you looked for all the exemptions here
which the capitalist is entitled to in England. The province
of capital with you is simply to keep labour in motion without
any further effort than that of vigilant superintendence; but
here the capitalist must make up his mind to set the example
of labouring himself, and, indeed, to consider himself as little
better than the foreman of the persons in his employment. He
must not expect to say * do this,? and see it done, but must
? Vide some able articles in the recent numbers of the Spectator on this sub-
ject, and especially on labour in the Australian colonies.


direct how it is to be done, and also lend a hand in doing it.
We must remember that, in a new country, labour, instead of
being the slave of capital, is itself the most valuable species of
capital, which never ought to be allowed to remain idle and
unproductive for a day, In England, where labour of every
description is plentiful and cheap, it would be bad economy in
a master to endeavour to save the wages of a labourer by
labouring himself, to the neglect of that general superinten-
dence, by which he is able to save incalculably more ; because
there the division of labour is carried so far, that without his
superintending head to direct and control every branch of it,
there would he endless irregularity and waste. But, in a new
country, where there is little or no division of labour, the best
sort of superintendence is that which is ever present in partici-
pating in the work to be done; and it is obvious, moreover,
that it is of the utmost consequence to the employer to fix
the scale of labour by the example of what he is capable of
performing himself.?

EFFECTS OF THE INFLUX OF GOLD UPON THE STANDARD
OF VALUE.

Here we have the authority of one of the earliest writers
on Financial Science that gold was the Standard of Value up
to the middle of the seventeenth century; and, by implication,
that it gave way to silver, when the American mines had
inundated the European markets with that metal. We have,


likewise, the authority of a distinguished modern, whose
Researches into the subject of the precious metals must be
ranked amongst the most valuable of economical contributions,
that gold has generally superseded silver as a standard of value
amongst the richest and the most civilized communities. Let
us see whether England has been wise in adopting, and adher-
ing to, her standard of gold.
In the preceding chapters of this little work we have
treated of gold as a commodity, and have endeavoured to trace
that precious metal from the mine to the mint, from the earliest
period to the present time. We shall now treat of it as a
measure of value, and as we have no desire to complicate the
question with hypothetic assumptions on the subject of the
currency, which we have endeavoured to dispose of elsewhere,*
even if space permitted, we shall content ourselves with simply
prefacing our observations with a few economical axioms,
which are generally received, and which, perhaps, will enable
the reader to follow us with greater facility.
Standard of Value. ?All things, as articles of commerce, are
subject to a comparison with each other?first, as regards their
length , or superficial content, or volume; secondly, as regards
their weight; and thirdly, as regards their value.
The only way by which they can be compared, at least con-
veniently, is by comparing each of them with some fixed and
invariable standard of measure, weight, or value.
Now, with an invariable standard measure of length we
are acquainted, because a pendulum of given length will beat the
same number of seconds in the same latitude all over the world.
Hence a pendulum that will beat seconds in any given latitude
is of an invariable length, and any part or multiple of that
length is also invariable. A definite part of the length of a
pendulum which beats seconds in a given latitude, we define a
yard, and by this standard measure of length, we compare the
length of all other things.
From hence it is also easy to perceive how we obtain an
invariable standard of superficial content and volume, in the
square foot or square yard, and cubic foot or cubic yard.
? Vide True Action of a Purely Metallic Currency. 1848.


Again, it is found that a cubic foot of distilled water is
always invariable in weight; and a certain part of this we
define to be a pound, and so have an invariable standard of
weight.
But nothing whatever presents us with an invariable
standard of value, because there is nothing which is invariable
in value itself. Be it what it may, its value is not fixed by any
law of nature, ?as is the length of a pendulum heating seconds
in a given latitude, or the weight of a determinate portion of
distilled water, ?but depends more or less upon extraneous cir-
cumstances. And an approximation , therefore, to an invariable
standard of value is the utmost that we can by any possibility
arrive at.
Our object, then, if we are to fix upon any particular com-
modity, by definite quantities of which we are to express the
value of definite quantities of all other commodities, is to select
such a commodity for our standard of value as is least of all
liable to fluctuations in value.
Now, every commodity varies in value, from time to time,
according as the relation between the supply of, and demand
for it varies. If we could discover a commodity of which the
existing supply would at all times be the same, and the demand
for it at all times, and at all places, be the same, then we should
have discovered a commodity whose value would always be the
same, and furnish us with an invariable standard of value.
The properties of the commodities which come nearest to
this ideal standard of perfection, as representatives of value
would appear to be, first, that they should not be articles of
consumption, as food, clothing, &c.; secondly, that they should
be too costly, and otherwise ineligible for domestic use, or for
working up for tools, machinery, arms, &c.; because the demand
for commodities applicable to such purposes would always be
varying, although the supply might remain the same.
Hence some one of the precious metals has been selected as
a standard of value by all civilized nations; but whether gold
or silver comes nearest to the ideal standard? i. e., which is
least liable to have its value disturbed by variations in the
supply of and demand for it?is a problem as yet undecided.


Gold being the scarcer of the two metals, the supply of it
is probably less variable than that of silver; but in times of
war, on the contrary, gold is subject to far greater extraordi-
nary demands than silver, for the support of marching armies,
&c., because a thousand pounds in gold is only about one-
sixteenth of the weight of the same sum in silver, and the
difference in bulk is still greater in favour of gold being the
most easy of transport.
We should conclude, therefore, that gold would afford the
best standard of value in peace, and silver in war; but much
disturbance would be occasioned by shifting from one standard
to another.
As neither of these metals are by any law of nature strictly
invariable in their value, still less can their value always bear
an invariable proportion. If, therefore, a state invests one of
them with a fictitious fixed value, for the sake of referring to it
as a standard of value, and then assumes, for the sake of inter-
changing them, that a given quantity of this ore is equal in
value to a fixed quantity of the other, this assumption will
frequently be contradicted by facts. Thus the silver franc is
referred to as the standard of value in France, and 15| ounces
of this silver is assumed to be equal to 1 ounce of gold; or,
which is the same thing differently expressed, 25 francs and
20 cents are assumed to be on a par in value with our golden
sovereign. But this assumed equality, we know, very fre-
quently proves a fallacious hypothesis, and at times is disturbed
to a considerable extent.
This arises from the fact, that although the supply of these
metals respectively should at all times be the same, still the
demand for them at all times, and in all places, might not be
the same. In pressing emergencies, an extraordinary demand
for gold, for particular purposes, might arise on the part of
certain states, and those states would be inclined to give much
more than 15| ounces of silver, rather than want it. Thus,
when large military operations are undertaken, gold, from its
more portable character, acquires a new value, and the govern-
ments standing in need of it will give a premium of three or
more per cent, for it in exchange for silver. Or the distribu-


tion of the metals throughout the world might be disturbed by
the currency operations of different governments, as took place
when an extensive coinage of gold was undertaken by the
States of Germany, and when the relative value of gold to
silver was reduced in the United States of America from 10~
to 15 against 1. When such operations as these are on foot,
gold, in all countries where it is not the standard of value?and
it is nowhere the sole standard of value except in England?
becomes an article of merchandise, and, relative to silver,
fluctuates in value as such, according to the intensity of the
demand for it.
Cost of Production. ?Cost of production?the cause which
decides the value of any other commodity?decides the value
of the precious metals. If the labour of one man, employed
for a year, could gather from the alluvial deposits say fifty
ounces of gold, and, by equal exertion, gather, from labouring
in the field, fifty quarters of corn, the corn and the gold would
be of equal value, and a single quarter of corn would be worth
an ounce of gold. If the same labour could produce, in the
same time, one hundred ounces of gold instead of fifty, a
quarter of corn would be worth two ounces instead of one, or
the reverse.
Relative value of the precious metals. ?The value of the
precious metals, relatively to other commodities, cannot be
fixed. It is subject to be affected by the same circumstances
of abundance, scarcity, supply, or demand, as affect the value
of all other commodities. If the relation between the supply
of, and the demand for, commodities was fixed and invariable,
the variable amount of the circulating medium would deter-
mine the range of prices from time to time ; and, on the other
hand, if the amount of circulating medium was fixed and inva-
riable, the range of prices would as certainly be determined by
the variable relation between the demand for, and the supply
of, commodities. Consequently, two causes of disturbance of
prices, always co-existent, but not always operative at the
same time, nor, when they are, always either co-operating with,
or counteracting each other. Again, a sudden increase of the
precious metals will lower their value in relation to commodi-


ties, and a sudden decrease will have precisely the opposite
effect. The discovery of the mines of Mexico and Peru, for
example, increased the general price of commodities four-fold,
or, in other terms, decreased to one-fourth the value of the
precious metals, when measured by commodities.
Depreciation. ?The precious metals may be depreciated by
a local alteration of the standard. If a state raises the denomi-
nation of its coin, or, which is the same thing, lowers its
standard, the real value of commodities when measured by the
coin will remain the same, as a less quantity will be given in
exchange for it. The coin of Turkey, for example, has been
gradually depreciated during the last thirty years, and the
price of commodities has proportionately advanced; and the
Spanish dollar is now worth twenty-two instead of three
piastres, while the rate of exchange upon London has risen
from twelve to one hundred and ten piastres. The same
remark will apply to the depreciated paper of Russia, which,
being inconvertible, performs the same duties, in relation to
commodities, as the precious metals. The quantity of the
paper currency was increased, between 1799 and 1811, from
two to six hundred rubles; and the pood of rye-flour, as a con-
sequence, rose from seventy to two hundred copecks. The
silver ruble, in the meantime, attained the value of four instead
of one and a half paper rubles, and the exchange upon Ham-
burgh fell from twenty-six schillings to ten. The Bank of
England furnished a similar example of depreciation, when it
enjoyed the privilege of being restricted from paying its notes
in gold. The circulation of its notes, at one time, increased
from ten to thirty millions, which caused prices to advance
twenty-five per cent., and the precious metals to be exported.
The value of gold increased from �3 17s. 10 Ad. to �5 ss. per
ounce, and the exchange upon Hamburg, the then principal
mart for bullion, fell from thirty-seven to twenty eight schil-
lings for the pound sterling.
An Increase of the Stock of Specie is an Increase of Cur-
rency and not of Capital. ?Specie, or a given quantity of gold or
silver in the shape of money, is not only the common measure
and common representative of all other commodities, but also


the common and universal equivalent , for it is of the essence of
money to possess intrinsic value. The active capital of society
consists in its productive stock, and the income of society in the
produce arising from it. Money in a state of currency, there-
fore, can form no part of either the one or the other; its sole
occupation is to exchange, not increase, the productive stock of
society. A nation may be just as rich, nay richer, with a cur-
rency of fifty millions, than with one of a hundred. If a nation
produced more with fifty than with a currency of one hundred
millions, it would, in proportion to the excess, be more opulent;
in that case, the fifty would be worth more than the hundred,
as any given portion of the former would exchange for a greater
amount of produce than a similar portion of the latter, and ex-
changing for more would be of more value. The currency of
France, as compared to that of England, will fully illustrate
this axiom. France, with a population of thirty-five millions,
possesses a currency of �140,000,000 ;* while the British
Islands, with a population of twenty-eight millions, possess a
currency of only forty millions. The cause of this disparity is
obvious?the general want of credit in that country occasions
the use of money in exchange to be nearly ten times as great
as in England. Money, moreover, is exclusively employed in
France as a safe, though unproductive investment. The French
peasant accumulates specie until he can buy a patch of land,
the only investment which he believes to be secure. The
English labourer, on the other hand, either expends all that
he earns, or lends his savings to the Government, or employs
them in a retail trade. Perhaps half the money in France does
not change hands once in ten years; yet, though she has nearly
three times as much money in proportion to her population as
England, gold and silver are more than one-third dearer there
than in England. It costs a Frenchman more labour to obtain
two ounces of silver, than it costs an Englishman to obtain
three; and if France could rely on internal tranquillity?if she
would cease ? playing at soldiers,? or even leave (he govern-
ment in esse, in something like a peaceful state, whatever its
principles or structure ?if mutual confidence and commercial

habits could be established among her people, sixty millions, or
less, might perform all the operations for which 140 millions
are now required. But, ?il regne dans toutes les classes un
amour exclusif de la richesse metallique,? exclaims M. Cheva-
lier,* and that intelligent economist proves that France pays
very dear for her hobby. Of the 825,000 kilos, of silver pro-
duced annually by America and Europe, France has coined,
since 1630, 360,000 kilos, or nearly half. The cost of coinage,
according to the above authority, is nearly four millions of
francs per annum. The passion for hoarding is also exceed-
ingly g rea f in France, arising, in a great measure, from her
unsettled political condition. Contrast this state of things
with that which prevails in this country. Here a small
amount of coin is sufficient to become the media, or, at least, to
balance the difference between the exchange of hundreds of
millions,+ as our whole system of banking, and commercial
dealings, are specially framed to economise the use of money.
But this system, so economical and yet so effective, can only
obtain in a community where mutual confidence prevails, and
where integrity is strictly and uniformly upheld.
Gradual Depreciation of the Precious Metals. ?That the
value of the precious metals has gradually decreased, espe-
cially since the discovery of America, is proved in several
ways, and that they continue to decrease slowly and progres-
sively is equally true. This, however, is an inconvenience, but
not an injustice, to the creditor class, for all that they have a
right to expect, all that their contract stipulates and the law
guarantees, is, that the quantity shall be the same, and not
that there shall continue an invariable relation between the
value of that quantity and other commodities. A great deal of
misapprehension prevails on this head, especially amongst
currency writers (whose name is legion, and whose science, in
general, is chaos), therefore it may be as well to simplify it.
We do not give a fixed price for gold, as is commonly asserted.
? Cours d?Economie Politique, Neuvieme Leeon. Paris, 1842.
+ We allude to, the Clearing-house for the London Bankers, through which
we believe, something like 1000 millions are passed annually without the inter-
vention of coin, except to a very trifling amount.


We merely say, by fixing tbe standard, that a conventional
pound shall mean the same thing to-morrow as to-day?the
same thing a month, or three months hence, when I am to be
paid for my goods as on that day I sold them. All the fixity
amounts to this : A sells B certain goods to day for one pound
sterling ?that is, so many grains of gold when the day of pay-
ment arrives, or what is equal to it, a bank note, for which he
can go and demand those number of grains of gold. The verity
is, that a fixed price of gold only means a fixed quantity. The
article itself, which forms this standing measure, never can rise
or fall in value with reference to itself, for a pound weight of
gold never can be worth a pound and a quarter of gold; and
being divided into definite portions, an ounce of this gold, or
one-twelfth of the pound weight, will always be worth
�3 17s. 10|d. The truth of these propositions would not be
affected by any imaginable increase or diminution in the quan-
tity of gold in the country. By such an increase or diminu-
tion, indeed, the value of all other things (the quantity and
demand remaining invariable) would be increased or diminished
in the same proportion with reference to gold; but gold itself
would still remain the fixed measure of the rising and falling
value of all other commodities, in reference to each other.
Before we apply these axioms, however, to the present and
prospective value of the precious metals, it will be necessary
to give an estimate of the total quantity of gold and silver
throughout the world in 1848 :
Silver . . . �1,208,000,000 Gold . . . �582,000,000.
whereas in 1500, antecedent to the discovery of the mines of
America, it is stated that there were in
Silver .... �28,000,000 Gold .... �12,000,000.
so that the quantity has increased, in the course of three cen-
turies and a half, by 1750 millions sterling.
The rise in the price of commodities during the same period,
or pari passu with the increase of the precious metals, according
to a most competent authority,* was in the following ratio:?
? Sir George Shuckburgh?s Table. Philosophical Transactions for the year


In the year 1500 ... 94 In the year 1800 . . . 562.
Or, which is the same thing, ninety-four pounds, shillings, or
pence, in the year 1500, were equal to five hundred and sixty-
two pounds, shillings, or pence, in 1800; that is, they would
have purchased the same quantity of commodities. In the con-
struction of his table, Sir George has taken the price of several
articles besides corn, so that his comparative estimate may be
considered as the nearest approximation to the truth.
The table, however, only comes down to 1800, which was
an excessively dear year, so that we ought to make a deduction
for the rise of prices in that year. From 1795 to 1801 wheat
averaged 87s. per quarter; and butcher?s meat had risen to
3045. 4d. per cwt., while in 1795 it was only 2025. 10d.* We
will take, therefore, Sir George?s estimate for 1780, as a fair
average of the price of commodities, which will give the last
member of the proportion as 427 instead of 562. We must also
deduct the quantity of the precious metals from the aggregate
of 1848, which have been imported since 1800, to enable us to
arrive at the precise quantity at that period. The annual pro-
duction of 1800, according to Humboldt,f was in round numbers
10,000,000 sterling; and the quantity in 1848, prior to the
recent discoveries, was 18,000,000 sterling, and if we assume
that 13,000,000 was the annual produce of the forty-eight years,
which will be nearly the mark, seeing that Russia has only
been a large producer during a third of that time, it will give
a sum of 624 millions, which, deducted from 1750 millions, the
aggregate produce of 1848, leaves 1126 millions.
The ratio of increase of the prices of commodities, as com-
pared with the increase in the quantity of the precious metals
will, therefore, stand as follows :
Commodities. Precious Metal.
As 94 ... . 427. 40 ... . 1,126.
While commodities have, therefore, advanced in price about
450 per cent., the precious metals have increased nearly 3000
per cent., or, in other terms, the precious metals are nearly
seven times less valuable, in relation to commodities, than they

were three hundred and fifty years ago. Here we hare a clear
proof of the decline in value of the precious metals, although
gradual, and almost imperceptible, in relation to debtor and
creditor.
The question now arises will the �20,000,000 of gold which
threatens, the term permitted, to pour annually into the
markets of the world, affect so great a disarrangement between,
debtor and creditor as many excellent people anticipate. Let
us examine the question minutely. We have said 20,000,000,
because that sum represents the average of the last two years,
the flush, as it were, of the golden stream pouring in upon us.
If this 20,000,000 continue to pour into the coffers of Europe it
cannot fail to produce two effects?first, it will increase the
aggregate of the coined monies circulating throughout Europe,
and, secondly, it will alter the relative value between gold and
silver. With respect to the latter effect, though it may not be
so serious as anticipated, yet the consequences which flow from
it will be of a most momentous character. Let us suppose, for
instance, that gold, instead of bearing as it does now a relative
value to that of silver, as 16| to 1, should be only twelve times
the value of silver. It would thus be depreciated about one-
fifth, and the 113 grains of fine gold in our sovereign would be
only worth sixteen shillings. In fact, it would require four
shillings worth more of gold, at that price, or twenty-eight
grains more, that is, 141 grains to discharge an obligation of
one pound sterling. In all our existing contracts, the bond
between the creditor and the debtor is, that for every pound
sterling of obligation, the former shall demand, and the latter
shall not be called upon to pay, more than 113 grains. The
operation of such a change will not only affect the public credi-
tor, but all those great social institutions, life assurance and
reversionary companies. For instance, the former, at some
distant date, in being called upon to satisfy a policy, after
having taken, for a series of years, of the insurer, gold which
was worth twenty shillings, would pay his representatives in
gold, which would be only worth sixteeen shillings. And, on
the contrary, a reversionary society which had advanced a
sum of money in gold worth twenty shillings for the distant


reversion of a larger sum, would, when the reversion fell in,
have to receive it in gold worth only sixteen shillings. In
fact, all the calculations which these institutions have made
during the last two generations would be stultified, to the
immense gain of one class, and the immense loss of the other.
In short, all creditors, annuitants, and those whose incomes
are fixed in amount by any contract; all leaseholders, and
those who are bound by time bargains, would find themselves
great losers, ?for it is hardly necessary to state that the depre-
ciation would make itself felt by a general and permanent rise
in the price of all articles, which is the same thing, only differ-
ently expressed, as a fall in the value of money. Some classes,
however, would be able to meet the rise in prices, others not.
Owners of unencumbered property, for instance, would not be
greatly affected, as rent would rise to the amount of the depre-
ciation, for the produce of the estate would exchange for more
gold, and rent is only a portion of this produce agreed upon
between landlord and tenant, so that the former would continue
to receive the same proportion of the gross produce, which
would amount to a larger sum reckoned in the depreciated
gold. But a great portion of the property is encumbered, in
some form or other, in this country, and the owners of such
property will be benefited by the depreciation, as their rents
will rise, and the sums which they have to pay to mortgagees,
&c., will remain fixed.* The working classes, however, would
be the most seriously affected by a depreciation, as their wages
would remain nominally the same, or be a long time before
they equalled the rise in the value of money. Such, in our
opinion, cannot fail to be the effect of the anticipated deprecia-
tion, should it take place.
Let us now view the opposite side of the question, and ex-
amine the probabilities of the supply of �20,000,000 being con-
tinuous. In the first place, that amount of gold has not aug-
mented annually the aggregate circulation, as it includes its
own cost of production, which ought to be subtracted. As-
suming 100,000 gold-finders in California, and 50,000 in Aus-
tralia, the result of whose labours is measured by the aggregate

amount of gold collected, and allowing each individual forty shil-
lings per week for sustenance, a low estimate, when viewed in
relation to the character of the labourers, and the exciting nature
of the labour?we shall then have an annual sum of �15,000,000
expended in actual necessaries. Deduct this sum from the twenty
millions, which is the average produce of the gold-fields, and we
have only Jive millions which it is possible to add to the circu-
lating money of the world. Does it follow that this five millions
will be so disposed of ? By no means. The possessors of this sur-
plus capital, looking at their characters, position, and prospects,
and above all, at the animating impulse of the age, are far more
likely to invest their surplus earnings in some industrial pur-
suit than put them out to interest (the only way in which such
earnings could increase the aggregate circulation); to buy land,
for example, or houses, or flocks, or in some way to sink their
capital, with the view of increasing it, rather than revert to
their old pursuits, and lend their money out to interest. In
short, they are more likely to keep their earnings in the shape
of capital than dispose of it so that it may be required for the
purposes of money. Under the circumstances, then, even the
five millions surplus would not be added to the money circu-
lation of the world; nor, looking to the nature of things, which
manifest themselves in so many ways, do we think they have
been so disposed of.*
But we will assume that the five millions have been added
to the circulating medium of the world. The question then
arises, will it violently interfere with the standard of value P
No?deferentially, no. The wants of the world will absorb it,
and would absorb a much larger amount, were it likely to be ob-
tained. Gold, in the shape of money, simply performs the duties
of ? petty cash,? in every state in the world which is likely to be
effected by its abundance. In all large mercantile transactions
it is seldom used; being merely required to balance differences.
Its peculiar and predominant function is in the ordinary dis-
bursements of society, and especially for locomotive purposes;
and as locomotion is an increasing quantity throughout the

plained in what way the additional gold has been disposed of.


world, gold, for that especial use, has been and will be, de-
manded proportionately. The world is now whisked about so
rapidly by steam, either on ocean or on land ?the order to
? move on ? is so imperatively given by the force of circum-
stances ?that everything in connection with the immediate
requirements of mankind partakes of its motion. Millions now
travel, where, but a few years ago, hundreds scarcely ventured
forth; and these millions require money, either in the shape of
silver or gold, to facilitate their travelling. The railways
alone will keep in almost constant activity the few millions of
gold ?say forty?that we have coined in this country. We
might pursue this subject to a more demonstrative close, did
space permit; this simple indication, however, must suffice to
point out the new power of absorption which the world has
acquired for the precious metals.
Again the manufacturers of this country and of Europe are
increasing their demands for the precious metals. In one house
alone, Messrs. Elkington and Mason of Birmingham, the con-
sumption daily is three hundred ounces of silver and gold in
proportion. Ex uno dtsce, both for England and France.
There is another view of the question, however, which ought
not to be omitted. Will the present supplies of California and
Australia be continuous? No, we repeat?deferentially, no.
There is every presumption against their continuance. In the
preceding pages of this book are described the several mines
which have been discovered throughout the world, whether by
excavating the rock, or by washing the alluvion of the water-
courses, and which have uniformly presented the same features
?first abundance, then barely remunerative supply, then
scarcity, and, lastly, abandonment. These have been the
almost universal stages of labour for the precious metals, from
the silver mines of Spain and Laurion down to those of America
?from the gold washings of the Pactolus to those of the Ural
Mountains.* And such, in our humble opinion, will be the
result of the Californian and Australian mines.
Viewing the question in this light, we may justifiably con-
? There would be little difficult/ in proving, we apprehend, that the Russian
mines barely pay for working at the present time, notwithstanding the annual


elude, first?that the supply of gold will not be so great as to
cause any material alteration in its relative value to other com-
modities, or, in other terms, to disturb the general relation of
things.
Secondly?that were the supply to continue at its present
amount, the growing wants of mankind, either for locomotive,
manufacturing, or for general social purposes, would fully
meet it.
Thirdly?that the supply of gold has not hitherto been
equal to the wants of mankind, even with the addition of the
production of the Russian mines, which is proved by that metal
gradually rising in value in relation to silver.
And, fourthly?that the discovery of gold in California and
Australia, viewed simply in relation to social wants, may be
considered as one of those opportune events which occur at long
intervals, as though they were specially designed for the
unravelment of human affairs, and for the onward movement
of human progress.
production of three millions sterling of gold. A statement of the cost of -working
the Ural mines?of the kind of labour employed?of the interest of the state,
apart from the economical bearings of the question?would furnish a curious
chapter in political science. The work of M. Tcbihatcheff, who visited the
Siberian mines in 1842, suggests some curious reflections upon this head, and,
?did space permit, we could show that our conjectures, as regards the remunera-
tion, are at least well founded, if not capable of precise demonstration.
