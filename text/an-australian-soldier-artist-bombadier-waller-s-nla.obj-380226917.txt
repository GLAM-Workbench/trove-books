An Australian Soldier-Artist
BOMBARDIER WALLER’S SKETCHES ON ACTIVE SERVICE.
MERVYN NAPIER WALLER is an Aus-
tralian, born twenty-five years ago at
Penshurst, his father being a farmer in
the picturesque Western District—popularly
known as “the garden of Victoria.” As a hoy
—an average, healthy, open-air, country hoy—
he taught himself the elementary means of
sketching what was so familiar to him in his
hush surroundings, hut more especially did he
find inspiration in the romantic, old-world
scenes and the picturesque people of those
more heroic times of the ancient Sagas.
When he was old enough to leave home and
choose his career, he went to Melbourne and
entered the art school at the National Gallery,
where he started in 1913 in the drawing classes.
There the country youth proved himself, winning
six of the eight available prizes of his year and al-
so the special prize for anatomy. He next en-
tered the painting school, where he won three
prizes. At that time, while continuing his
studies, he obtained some commissions as an
illustrator from local publishing firms, and al-
so exhibited pen-and-ink decorative designs.

Australian Artillery Entering Bapaume, By M. N. Waller.


Thus a promising career as an artist was opening up for him when, in August,
1915, he answered the call to active service, and enlisted in the 22nd Infantry Battalion,
A.I.F. He transferred into the Artillery, 18-pounder battery, and in May, 1916, he
embarked in H.M.T.S. “Medic,” completing his training on Salisbury Plains, England.
At the end of 1916 he left for France, and active service at the front, as a
Bombardier in the 111th Howitzer Battery, of the 4th Division, A.1.F.. going into
action in the beginning of the next year. He took part in battles on the Somme
front and at Bapaume, into which town he had the satisfaction of entering with his
Battery at its memorable capture from the enemy. Thence he went to Bullecourt.
and there, in May, was dangerously wounded in the right hand, shoulder, and back
by a high-explosive shell. He was taken to the 22nd General Hospital at Camieres,
near Etaples. where, in three weeks, he was operated on four times, the doctors
hoping that his right arm. so necessary to him as an artist, would be saved. But
it was found imperative to amputate the whole arm, so as to save his life.
Since his return to Australia in January of this year, Mr. Waller has trained his
left hand to draw and paint pictures of life in camp, and on active service
with the Australian Artillery. These drawings, together with a collection of his
original sketches, now form the first exhibition in Australia of pictures of the conflict
in France made by an Australian soldier-artist.
This collection comprises pictures of actual happenings and, as such—and quite apart
from their artistic merit —they form a valuable pictorial record of the historic retire-
ment of the Germans from the Somme, and the part played therein hy the Australian
Artillery.
