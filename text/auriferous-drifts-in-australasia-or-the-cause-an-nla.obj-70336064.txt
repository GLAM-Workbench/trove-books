PREFACE
It is a proof, doubtless, of no common temerity, and, perhaps,
unpardonable presumption in a mere student of the physical
sciences, to call in question the accuracy of scientific theories
of world-wide adoption, as advanced by, or having passed the
scrutiny of, the great Sir Isaac Newton, and other eminent
mathematicians and astronomers; and which, though not now
altogether uncavilled at, by daring investigators among their
successors in the field of scientific enquiry, are yet generally
regarded as uncontroverted truths. But, behold a greater than
even Solomon is now appealed to. The incontestible evidence
of the Book of Nature, revealed to unprejudiced research ?the
Author, the Omnipotent Lord God of the Universe. We have
also to guide us in the unerring pursuit of the knowledge of
Truth ?by the chain of Divine assertions of matters of fact, and
the prophetic lore, which runs as the vein of life through-
out, evincing a Divine origin the inspired revelations of
Truth contained in the Holy Woed of God. ?Between
the Woed, and the Woeks of God, there can be no actual
discrepancies,? remarked the lamented author of The Testimony
of the Bocks; but, as Sir Charles Lyell remarks, ?a false
theory may render us blind to facts which are opposed to our
prepossessions; or may conceal from us their true import, when
we behold them,? and this we have found demonstrated in
course of our researches, our only object in which?being wholly
unbiassed in our investigations ?being the discovery of incon-
trovertible truths. In the interests of truth, and advancement
and propagation of knowledge calculated to conserve the welfare
of the human family, it appears to us an imperative duty, inde-
pendent of personal considerations, and, if need be, with a self-
sacrificing spirit, to strive to arouse popular attention to subjects
which will, when studied, be found of engrossing interest, and
of no common moment to mankind at large, at this stage of the
existing era. It is well that we can now venture to assail pre-
judices, or ? prepossessions,? as to matters of fact, without being
liable, like Galileo, to be put to the torture for the heresy of
considering and announcing facts demonstrative of the rotation
of the globe on its axis of gravitation. Sir Charles Lyell again
remarks: ?We have now at least the advantage of knowing from
experience, that earnest and patient enquiry as to how far


geological appearances are reconcilable with the effect of changes
now in progress, has always put geologists on the road that leads
to truth, suggesting views, which, although imperfect at first,
have been found capable of improvement, until at last adopted
by universal consent.? In the hope that, notwithstanding
our literary disabilities, and admitted imperfections, our
recorded deductions, after an ? earnest and patient inquiry ?
involving much study of all available authorities upon the sub-
ject, with all its collateral conditions and difficulties, may be
round to ? lead to truth,? we, with all humility, submit them,
iheir originality may, perhaps, excuse our occasional want of
fluent language to express our meaning, and our employment of
words whose strictly proper meaning, as scientific terms, may
render their more general use by us in some degree inappropriate.
In our individual and practical experience of a miner?s life in
Victoria, the phenomena of the rounded attrition of the hardest
crystalline minerals, during the comparatively brief period
assigned by the Mosaic account, as having elapsed since the
Creation, while, apparently during many centuries past, these
pebbles, with other evidently waterworn stones and boulders,
have quietly reposed where deposited, in ancient and evidently
long unused watercourses?the watersheds supplying which are
not now discernible?awakened conjecture, the spirit of inquiry,
and ?time and the hour? being opportune, with reference to*
leisure and facilities for study, prolonged and indefatigable
research, successively, resulting in the discoveries made, and
theories now arrived at. Our greatest source of disappointment
has been the difficulty experienced in submitting the ?True
Theory? to the public, except in such disjointed fragments as
would but excite objections, most of which may have been
foreseen and refuted in the body of the work, and might thus
perhaps mar its favorable reception and revision by science.
. In y iew of approaching danger to a section of our earth and its
inhabitants (see Isaiah ii. 10-28, and xiii. 9-13; Joel i. 15 ?
A.mos v. 18-20; Zephaniah i. 14?18, &c.), from which there is
possibility of escape (see Psalm Ixii. 16; Isaiah vi. 13 and xvii. 6,
Zechariah xiii. 8, and Revelations xviii. 4), publication thereof
appears as imperatively our duty, as to warn the blind from pur-
suing the path terminating abruptly in a precipice. ?If thou
forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death, and those that
are ready to be slain. If thou sayest, Behold we knew it not,
doth not He that pondereth the heart, consider it P and He that
keepeth thy soul, doth not He know it? and shall not He
render to every man according to his works ? ? ? Deliver me
from blood-guiltiness, O Gron, Thou Gron of my salvation! ?
Melbouene, 21 st May, 1868.

CHAPTER I.
INTRODUCTORY OBSERVATIONS ON THE SCOPE OF THE WORK, AND
THE IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS INVOLVED.
? Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days, and caused the day-spring to know his
place ; that it might take hold of the ends of the earth ; that the wicked might be shaken out
of it ? It is turned as clay to the seal,? &c.?Job xxxviii. 12-15.
? The earth is utterly broken down. The earth is clean dissolved. The earth is moved
exceedingly. The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be removed like a
cottage ; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it; and it shall fall, and not rise
again.??lsaiah xxiv. 19-20.
? For the Lord God of Hosts shall make a consumption, even determined, in the midst of
all the land.??lsaiah x. 23.
? O thou that dwellest upon many waters, abundant in treasures, thine end is come, and
the measure of thy covetousness.?
?The sea is come up upon Babylon: she is covered with the multitude of the waves
thereof.??Jeremiah li. 13 and 42.
The limits of a small pamphlet admit of but a brief record of
some of the chief evidences supplied by nature and the Sacred
Word in support of the theory submitted. It is an axiom that
the accurate solution of one scientific or other difficulty often
elucidates other ambiguities or problems of similar kind. Some,
unrecorded here for want of space, have been indicated in course
of our researches, and commented upon in the work originally
designed. Should this humble effort to elucidate some of the
problems of science and of the Sacred writings meet with
reasonable encouragement to extended researches, and leisure per-
mit, glimpses vouchsafed of knowledge in advance beckon us
onward and upward, and our spirit longs to obey the call.
The ? True Theory? herein alluded to, refers to a work entitled
? The True Theory of the Earth, and Philosophy of the Predicted
End, being a solution of some of the Great Problems of Science
and Sacred Prophecy, on the testimony of the two witnesses, the
Pook of Nature and the Word of Gon,? which has been forwarded
to Europe for publication, and more extended circulation, than
circumstances warranted expectation of, if published here. The
present pamphlet is in part an extract (Chapter iv.) from that
work, for which local circulation is sought, its matter referring
more particularly to Victoria, as a portion of the gold-bearing
countries of Australasia. Herein we seek to apply the incontro-
vertible truths , now, for the first time presented in their true
light , of superlative moment to the temporal destiny of a large


section of the family of man, to the immediate advantage of the
world at large, and necessarily, as we believe, and have endea-
voured to demonstrate, the rapid increase of population, and
probable consequent prosperity of the whole of the Australasian
colonies, and, mayhap, of British territories, yet to be colonised
within the Pacific Ocean, the nuclei of future empires.
Physical science now combines with sacred prophecy, in
announcing the early impending fate of the Old World?the
ancient Roman empire. Europe is doomed to a desolating ? con-
sumption, ? The coveted possession of the Americans, recently
ceded by Russia, is even now being merged in polar regions. A
vast catastrophe is ever continuously approaching with definable
progress, to be suddenly accelerated when ? the time of the end?
shall have arrived. Prom the times of the earliest writers of the
books of the sacred W ord, the now early approaching ? end? was
foreshadowed in prophetic vision. Enoch, but the seventh from
Adam ; holy Job, a very ancient resident on lands adjacent to the
tributaries of the Tigris and Euphrates, where numerous relies
of the magnificent erections of pre-diluvial man, of massive
strength and grandeur, must have been constantly suggestive to
him of a possible recurrence of the Noachian convulsion, though,
under the Divine covenant, not universally destructive; the
sweet singer of Israel, whose lips and heart were touched with
a live coal from the altar of his God; the sacred prophets; yea,
even our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, in the Gospel of the?New
Testament; and the enwrapt seraph-like apostle John, in his
lonely island home, Patmos?are each, and all, the inspired
expositors ot events that shall be at a day and hour no living
man knows, but all mankind are earnestly and solemnly enjoined
to watch and prepare for. Science now reiterates the warning,
and explaining its practical, literal, and not merely metaphorical?
urges upon mankind at large, a new estimate of our
tenure of the pomps and vanities of a passing world, which is,
in itself, as constantly exposed to mutations as any coveted
possession of man, or life itself. The ?daughters of Zion
dwelling with the daughters of Babylon,? the nations occupying
the localities of anticipated desolation, symbolised in Scripture
under various appellatives, are besought to escape therefrom, ere
the dread ?hour ? of destruction arrives, when ?there shall be
upon every high mountain, and upon every high hill, rivers and
streams of water, in the day of the great slaughter, when the
towers fall, when the earth is once more, as in past geological
eras, turned as clay to the seal,? prepared to receive the new
impress, termed in prophecy the ? New Earth,? or, ? restitution
of all things ? to the antediluvian state, when all things were
deemed ? very good ? by the Creator.
In the dread ?hour,? when ?the foundations? of the earth
? are destroyed, what can ? mortal man, even ?the righteous, do ??
They, if still within the proscribed areas, must, with ?the kings
of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief


captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every
freeman, hide themselves in the dens, and in the rocks of the
mountains.? It may be, temporal safety may thus be attained,
for ? when thus it shall he in the midst of the land among the
people, there shall he as the shaking of an olive tree, and as the
gleaning grapes when the vintage is done. They shall lift up
their voice, they shall sing for the majesty of the Lord, they
shall cry aloud from the sea? for the windows from on high
are open, and the foundations of the earth do shake. The earth
is clean dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly. The earth
shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and it shall fall? (beneath
the ocean, except the mountain tops, then become scattered
islands) ? and not rise again.? There are numerous passages
similar to the above in the Sacred Word. Possessed of the key
to which, the interpretation is plain, and he who runs may read
them with understanding, and conviction of their beauty, and
graphic truth, far in excess of any of the multitudinous figurative
meanings assigned to them, which are daily more and more
obscuring the most important testimonies of the Sacred Word.
While Christians are disputing over the respective accuracies
of their pre or post millennarian ideas of the intro-
duction of the Messianic era, the world at large are
permitted to continue unwarned of the true meaning
of the declarations of Scripture, involving considerations
of temporal safety during an inevitable, vast, and appalling
physical convulsion ?similar to those revealed by Geology, which
have successively subverted the Earth?s crust ?as well as the
question of eternal life in a future state. A gracious over-ruling
Providence engages to ? allure ? the people ?to the wilderness,?
or remote place, until these calamities, within defined limits, are
overpast. Now, in these last days, the doom, and danger of
delay, exposed to them, is announced in terms and upon evidence
there can be no cavilling at, or setting aside. God willeth not
that any of those wise to understand should even temporarily
perish, if they will but escape in time, to countries of remote
geographical position from the localities chiefly threatened. To
us, already removed ones, the hait to ? allure ? others, is now
made known ? illimitable wealth, open to enterprise, capital, and
industry of the world, deducible from our auriferous ? leads,? of
which the origin, and their successive arrangement within the
localities of deposition, are now demonstrable ?the site embracing
every ancient valley in the Colonies of Australasia, fed, no matter
at what distance from gold-bearing rocks, whether erupted, and
overflowed, or in situ. The discovery is fraught with matter of
momentous importance to the gold colonies, and may well in-
augurate a new era in the history of their progress, and national
prosperity. And it is now, viewing the momentous interests
at stake elsewhere, our duty, as well as to our advantage,
to strain every nerve to render the glittering bait more
attractive, and rapidly locate, amidst our almost illimitable


waste expanses, the capital, the energy, the persevering
enterprise, and steady industry, with the corresponding full
circle of domestic felicities, heretofore concentrated so largely
in our European fatherlands. In a secular point of view, the
mining interest of Australasia is paramount to all others, which
indeed will prove but subsidiary to it. Under wise legislation,
and adequate fostering care, and means of development, such
revenues could be raised, by farming out deep leads, as discovered
by a staff of engineers, with scientific appliances, under official
control, as would render the colonies of Australasia, independent
of pettifogging tariffs, and taxes upon aught but unemployed
capital, whether in the shape of hoarded monies or unimproved
lands, and furnish ample means of defence against attacks from
any human enemy.
The beginning of the ? end? foreshadows itself, and the signs
of latter-day events are the theme of conversation among Chris-
tians in all parts of the world. Who will now tamper with the
Warning Cut, ? Come out of her, my people, that ye he not
partaker of her plagues? ? Many events may rapidly occur, in
a social point of view, to render emigration almost an impossi-
bility in future, to some who might now avail themselves of oppor-
tunities. Europe will not long part readily with her stalwart sons
?the life and hope of progress in the colonies?even to subjugate
and populate her distant dependencies, when her great internal
conflict for monarchical supremacy approaches. Now, while evil
days are still retarded in their approach, the preliminary panics,
and perplexity, and utter want of confidence in the future, check
the by-past current of commercial prosperity, and dispose many
to a consideration of a change of home. While we here, in Aus-
tralasia, cannot predict the result of European conflicts upon our
enjoyment of peace, nor our ultimate destiny in the ? Great
Tribulation,? we have hopeful evidence in favour of the safety of
Australasia, and its elevation in the scale of nations to the
position of a great, good, prosperous, and enlightened (confede-
rated) empire. Come now, and join our ranks. Union?concen-
tration of numbers to unite their lot with ours, and strive for
pre-eminence of virtue and philanthropy?is strength for
progress, mutual support, and defence against such evils
as man can cope with. How are we here to aid in
accomplishing the removal of ? men far away ? from the antici-
pated scene of appalling visitations and utter desolations P The
omnipotent Euler of the destinies of the universe, working more
in our sight by the wonders of Nature, than by miraculous
interposition, now, in these last days, points out to us the magnet
to population, in the attraction op gold in previously unheard
of abundance. ? Behold,? saith the Almighty One, by the word
of His inspired prophet, ? I will allure her (the people) to the
wilderness.? Man, whether of the Church of Christ or of the
world alone, is impressionable to the allurement of easily acquired
wealth, and there is no sin in its equitable acquirement, provided


the responsibilities entailed by its possession are duly recognised, and
relative duties performed with true benevolence toman, and pure
love to the Great Father of all. �e ? don?t pretend to under-
value money. It is God?s gift as much as anything else. It
depends on us, whether it be a blessing or a curse.? There is a
practically unlimited sphere ever open by the varyingdispensations
of Providence, in accomplishing wise and merciful purposes, in
the refining, and purifying, and fitting for the blissful enjoyment
of the occupations of a heavenly inheritance, the naturally sordid,
grovelling, and worldly idol-loving sons of men, wherein the
ministrations, and warm-hearted charity of the truly benevolent,
must necessarily be acceptable. Let not the more general
prosperity now opening up before us, in the good providence of
God, bring upon us the awful doom of the cities of the plain ; for
in their ? pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness,? they
did not ? strengthen the hand of the poor and needy ; and they
were haughty, and committed abomination, therefore (saith God)
I took them away as I saw good.?
We have heard it remarked recently, in Yictoria, that
the discovery of any potent inducement, to redirect hither an
extended migration of European population, to sustain and revive
our presently dormant prosperity, would be regarded as a patriotic
act. To us, the highest gratification would be afforded, if prompt
means were employed to test and benefit by our discovery, for
development of the local prosperity of each of the gold colonies,
and, by so doing, demonstrate throughout Australasia, an
adequate attraction to population from other parts of the world,
which must result in a largely extending immigration. We
should all also as a mere question of duty to our fellow man,
strive to understand the doctrine involved, and if gifted, by the
Divine source of wisdom,' with lucid views, and power to express
them, of the grand agencies to be employed, and their results in
accomplishing the ?consummation,? ?? when the end shall be with
a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined,?
which ? they that escape, shall escape, and shall be upon the
mountains,? ?seek to impart the information widely, that the
? remnant ? spoken of in so many passages of sacred prophecy,
as saved, ? the escaped of the nations,? may be the greater. Let
us seek to employ our leisure, our wealth, and the available re-
sources of our countries in the philanthropic effort. The future
with us in Australasia is with God. We know not ? what a day
may bring forth.? But we have no time to lose. Our duty is
with to-dat, to-morrow is not ours. Therefore, whatever
appears our immediate duty in connection with this new stimulus
to action, let us up and do it with our might, leaving future
events, in all their complications, involving our peculiar lot,
humbly and trustfully, to the disposal of the Almighty. All our
available powers should be directed to such primary measures, as
may advance the great object of averting the necessity of aban-
donment, to impending destruction, of the most appalling and


irrecoverable character, the great, the wise, and the good, the
innocent, and the otherwise helpless, amidst the loved ones of our
fatherlands. ? For as a snare shall it come on all them that
dwell on the face of the whole earth. Watch ye therefore.?
One of the ? wonders in the heavens and in the earth,?
to be displayed ? before the great and terrible day of
the Lord comes,? may be the remarkable and locally terrific
darkening of the sun over a portion of the earth, during
the unusually prolonged totality of the great solar eclipse
expected on 17th August next. Moreover, the astronomical
position of the moon, unusually near the earth, may, by universal
gravitation, result (according to the theory of Professor Delisser,
as applied to prognostication of the West Indian earthquakes
and hurricanes last year) in momentous changes, preparatory to
the appallingly grand phenomena of the ? consummation,? when
? the sun shall go down at noon, and darken the earth in the
clear day,? and the constellations appear to fall to the earth,
and the heavens to vanish away ?as a scroll when it is rolled
together ? ?expressions of appearances to man?s earthly vision,
readily understood, when we think of our own inaccurate form of
expression, ? the sun?s path in the heavens.? The rotation of
the earth being suddenly arrested, when ? He causeth the day-
spring to abide at the ends of the earth,? and a deviating evolu-
tion taking place, owing to loss of equilibrium, ? the earth shall
reel to and fro like a drunkard,? oscillating to a new centre of
gravity. Portions shall ?be removed ?by the rush of oceanic
disruption (see Amos viii. 8), ?like a cottage? built on the
sand, and swept off by the flood ; ?the wicked,? aye, and many of
the righteous ? shall be shaken out of it,? ? and it shall fall and
not rise again ? from beneath the ocean Avave,? and ? never shall
be any more,? ? shall be found no more at all.? Such, Greology
proves, has been the result in past ages of the earth. Why
should it not occur again, under the controlling hand of the
Almighty, Avhen He once more breaks up the past-decreed place
of the ocean, and again sets bars and doors thereto, according to
prophecy? Science therefore, in conjunction with Scripture
revelation, now calls man to serious consideration of the muta-
bility of the shell of the earth we inhabit, where what is visible
and imposing to-day, to our finite ideas of grandeur and magni-
ficence, may, to future generations, be but the subject of allusion,
as a mere tradition of former existences, beneath a profound
ocean, or covered by sedimentary deposits from the ? overflowing
flood ?of its troubled waters. ?In that day a man shall cast the
idols of his silver and of his gold, which they made for him to
Avorship, to the moles and to the bats, to go into the clefts of
the rocks, and into the tops of the rugged rocks, for fear of the
Lord and for the glory of His majesty, when He ariseth to
shake terribly the earth.? Also see Matthew xxiv. 36-39, &c.
Before closing these someAvhat desultory observations, it may
bo Avell to anticipate an objection Avith Avhich our theory Avill be


met, not by the biblical student, but by the cursory Scripture
reader, whose prejudices in favour of metaphorical interpretations
of sacred prophecy, militate against its literal exposition. Such
will ask, How can the end ?be with a flood, when the earth
and the works that are therein shall be burned up?? Our theory
recognises as a necessary sequel to the primary phenomena ot
the ? end,? electric convulsions of the elements, and igneous
activity of the long-slumbering volcanoes, the former action ot
which has been graphically depicted by Dr. Hibbert in his work,
The Extinct Volcanoes of the Basin of the Rhine, and by other
geologists. We believe the assertions of the inspired writers,
that while ordinary ? battles of the warrior are with confused
noise, and garments rolled in blood,? this great battle the
Lord God Almighty ? shall be with burning and fuel of fire,?
and that the crust of the earth affected may be so erupted, ? that
there shall not be found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire
from the hearth, or to take water out of the pit, and therein the
works of man ? shall be burned up.? Yet, the same holy Word
of God clearly conveys the impression ol a ? remnant ? being
saved, in a multitude of passages, which man, in his pride ot
human intellect, deeming to have only metaphorical alhisions,
practically ignores the value of, in elucidation of the temporal
destiny of our race. He thus overlooks the sacred predictions,
(.Isaiah Ixvi. 19-24, Ac.), that after ?the elements? have melted
?with fervent heat,? the carcases of the destroyed myriads of
mankind are to remain, unburnt and uncovered, until buried
by special ordinance, and meanwhile to be the prey of the
undestroyed ? beasts of the field,? and ? fowls ot the air,
which, if all the earth were burnt up, must assuredly perish with
it. Again, during the reign of the Great King, or what we term
the Messianic era, His ? suppliants, the daughter ot His dis-
persed,? are ? from beyond the rivers of Ethiopia, to bring their
offering. His people are to be collected from the east, and from
the west, and from the north, and from the south. 'lhey are to
be brought as an offering from the surviving nations, ? in litters,
and on mules, and swift beasts,? ? and with them the blind and
the lame, a great company shall return thither. Ihe kings
and princes of the earth, in one passage (fEzek. xxvi. 15-21)
represented as laying aside their gorgeous robes to mourn over
the appalling calamity, which has then fallen upon, aud irre-
coverably ruined, a section of the earth, and all but a few
survivors therein, are elsewhere depicted as bringing their wealth
and glory to lay at the feet of the Great King. {Rev. xxi. 24-26).
Yea, even the residue ot the nations which come against
Jerusalem to the last great battle, are to come up year by year
to the feast of tabernacles, subject to the penalty for non-com-
pliance, of being visited with drought. But our prescribed
limits, already exceeded, are inadequate for further proofs of the
inaccuracy of the assumption that all mankind on the earth, are
to be either translated or burned up. ? Search the Scriptures


is the injunction of our Loud. The Talmud, referring to the
Sacred Word, says ?? Turn it and turn it again, for everything
is in it;? and from it, whether we have been able or not to
deduce it accurately, we have initiated the ? True Theory.?
Bev. Dr. Guthrie remarks: u lt were well if many in the
highest matters took a lesson from the lowest creatures. Why
did the world before the flood perish P but just because it pro-
nounced the same judgment on Noah?s conduct, which a child
would do on many of the instincts that guide the inferior crea-
tures, and illustrate the wisdom of their Maker.? We have
frequently observed priorto ?and before the barometer indicated ?
change of weather, the preparations made by the land crabs in
anticipation of a coming flood; and if to be of unusual height,
the bustling activity of ants in removing their stores and larvae
from logs liable to be submerged, into the hollows of trees, well
out of danger; their instinct, and assiduity in obeying its pre-
cepts, are a study of themselves to the watchful observer of
matters of natural history. ? When Noah,? continues Dr.
Guthrie, ? building his ark tar remote from shore or any sea to
float it, was raising deck on deck of that mighty ship, he was
?the song of drunkards? and the butt of scorners * * * *
but when the sea sprung with a roar over its ancient boundaries,
and the terrible cry arose, ? The flood is come! ? and the alarm
spread, and pale with fear ?their shrieks mingling with the rush
of rain, and the hoarse thunders of the rising sea?the people
fled to the nearest heights, and crowding closer and closer on
their lessening tops, like castaways to a passing ship, stretched
out their arms to the ark as it floated by ?what then ? Ah,
then? (as it will be again with multitudes who will, ere the end
come, deride and scoff at the predictions of it, and portents
vouchsafed of its approach) ? the wisdom of God would no
longer be deemed foolishness with men.? Lot, urging immediate
removal from Sodom upon his sons-in-law, ? seemed to them as
one that mocked,? but not so when the morning came: and
while Lot, entering into Zoar, and Abraham, in the neighbouring
plains of Mamre, enjoyed perfect immunity, the war of elements
began, and upon the wicked was rained ? quick burning coals,
fire, and brimstone, and an horrible tempest,? followed by sub-
mergence of the cities beneath the waters of the Dead Sea.
Thus it may be in the time of the ? end,? accomplishing literally
the predictions of the Sacred Prophets, and also accomplishing
physical effects in detail, precisely similar to what Geology indi-
cates, as having previously resulted, in the great periodic igneous
developments, and cataclysmal convulsions of past epochs.


CHAPTER 11.
PROPOSITIONS OF THE TRUE THEORY OF THE EARTH, AND A BRIEF
SYNOPSIS OF THE LINE OF EVIDENCES ADVANCED IN
SUPPORT THEREOF.
?Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the
hail, which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?? ?
Job xxxviii. 22-23.
?He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap. He layeth up the depth in
storehouses.? ?Psalm xxxiii. 7.
? I will overturn, overturn, overturn it, until He come whose right it is, and I will give it
Him.?? Ezekiel xxi. 27.
? Seek Him, that maketh the day dark with night, that calleth for the waters of the sea, and
poureth them out upon the face of the earth : the Lord is His name.?? Amos v. 8.
? And the Lord God of Hosts is He that toucheth the land, and it shall melt, and all that
dwell therein shall mourn ; and it shall rise up wholly like a flood ; and shall be drowned as by
the flood of Egypt.?? Amos ix. 5.
The ? True Theory ?of the causes affecting the conformation
of the earth?s crust, as known to geologists, and its astronomical
position upon the plane of its orbit, is submitted in the following
propositions:?
I. ?That the Newtonian theories of the primitive fluidity of the
matter of the globe, of its conseguent oblate spheroidal figure,
and of its continuance upon a given axis of rotation are
untenable.
2. ? That the true figure of the superficies of the earth is now that of
an elongated spheroid, the polar being longer than the equatorial
diameter.
3. ?That the southern polar radius is non' longer than the northern
polar radius.
4. ?That influences are in operation in nature, tending to equalize
the lengths of the respective polar radii; that is, to presently
increase the arctic elongation.
5. ?That at a former period of the earth s history, prior to the
Noachian deluge, the same influences, tended by the same natural
laws , to the elongation of the southern polar radius.


6. ?That the necessary result of such continuous operation of causes
affecting the relative length of the respective polar radii, is to
momentarily disturb the equilibrium maintaining any given
centre of gravity of the whole volume of the earth.
7.? That, consequently, there is a continuous series of changes in the
earth?s axis of rotation, accomplished either momentarily, or by
successive movements, as the vis inertia of continuance upon
any assumed centre of gravity is overcome, by gravitation
towards a new centre.
B. ?That the position of the earth upon the plane of her orbit, at
any given moment, is not more permanent than her continuance upon
her then axis of rotation, but is subject to movements or changes
of relative position of the plane of the equator to that of the
ecliptic, the result of gravitation of the matter of the earth, and
apparently, of the earth alone.
9.? That, consequently, the phenomena attending the precession of
the equinoxes, and nutation, are referable solely to the action of
terrestrial gravitation.
10. ?That terrestrial gravitation, as affected, or continuously called
into action, by the (noted) operation of certain physical influences,
is the agency adequate to account for, and effecting, observed
alterations in the relative elevation of sea level upon coast lines ;
and the ever varying position of zones of temperature, and climate,
in relation to latitudes, as presently defined; and also certain
magnetic phenomena of varying currents and storms ; with certain
anomalies in the action of the tidal wave, hitherto unaccounted for,
if not deemed inexplicable; and that the eyer progressing
changes, marked by these phenomena, ultimately tend towards
accomplishing, by natural agency alone, the predictions of Scrip-
ture of the ? End,? or destruction of the existing aspect of the
earth?s crust, declared in the Roly Word oe GtOd to be ? standing
in the water, and out of the water ? ?and originate a ? New
Earth ? of varied configuration.
11. ?That the presently progressive movement of the axis of rotation
tends towards coincidence with the magnetic axis.
12. ?That coincidence of these axes would result in coincidence of
the planes of the equator and ecliptic, resulting in perpetual
equinox; and by free undistorted streams of electricity thus
pervading the earth, largely increase its fertility and salubrity,
and the probable longevity of the human race, in accordance with
the predictions of the inspired prophets, of the aspect of nature,
with reference to man upon the ? New Earth.?


Sir J. C. Ross in his Voyage of Discovery to Antarctic 'Regions ,
g t a tes ?? The deficiency of atmospheric pressure noted in the
Antarctic from 63 deg. to 74 deg. south latitude, and 8 deg. to
7 deg. west longitude, amounts to a difference in the height of the
mercurial column of an inch or upwards ; and is equivalent to an
elevation of 800 feet above (what is termed) sea level throughout
most of the northern hemisphere, where there is but little
variation in the height of the mercurial column, from the tropics,
to the highest latitudes in which observations have been made.
From the tropics to the equator, the pressure diminishes, but in
a less degree, or to the amount of '24 of an inch.? Dr. Maury
states ? that in the Antarctic regions, the mean height of the
barometer is less than 29 inches, whereas in the Arctic regions,
say in latitude 78 deg., it is nearly an inch higher.? Now, we
are informed by geologists that a rise of the northern seas to an
extent equalising the waters diffused over both hemispheres, or
say ? to the extent of 500 feet, would sink the sources of the
Volga,? which flows into the Caspian Sea, which is 80 feet now
below ocean level, and situate in a vast cavity, a once inland sea,
now evaporated for lack of inflow, the average level of which is
beneath the level of the ocean, and would of course deeply sub-
merge it, ? and drown the most of Europe.? Our researches
enable us to demonstrate that agencies are in operation, con-
tinuously affecting the centre of gravity of our Earth?s volume,
and constantly, and apparently, by definable changes, in the
elevation or depression of ocean levels noted on coast lines, and
magnetically, progressing towards such an alteration of cir-
cumstances of equilibrium, as that an earthquake, such as is pre-
dicted in Sacred Prophecy, as to occur prior to the Messianic
era, the period of which commentators maintain is just at
hand, would in one brief-?hour,? cause the ?earth to reel to
and fro like a drunkard,? accomplish the ? end with a flood,? and
desolate the northern hemisphere.
The disproportionate accumulation of the waters of the globe in
the southern hemisphere, has never been duly taken into account,
in the observations instituted for the measurement of degrees, in
estimating the alleged oblate spheroidal form of our globe. A deep
sea sounding in the Southern Ocean is recorded, with bottom, at
8,000 fathoms! a much greater depth than obtainable in the
oceans of the northern hemisphere. Sir Isaac Newton was not
aware of the immense disproportion of the volume, and conse-
quent density of the southern hemisphere, when he laid down
his theory that ?to preserve the hydrostatic equilibrium, the
proportion of the polar to the equatorial diameter must be as
230 to 231.? We maintain that the only true standard of level
is atmospheric pressure, the mean average of which, noted from
observation taken at level of the ocean in all parts of the world,
under circumstances of atmospheric quiescence, will give the only
correct standard, by which to measure enlargements, or dimin-
ished, and depressed surfaces, of the oceans on the globe, in


which, on the authority of the inspired Word, the continents of
the earth are declared to be ? standing in the water, and out of
the water.? If we take a shallow plate, half filled with water,
and place therein a few stones, just level with the surface, what is
the effect when we tilt up one side of the plate, as the earth is
tilted on the plane of her orbit ? The water is still as level as
before, but the stones, like the continents and islands of the earth,
are submerged in the deep waters at one end, and left dry
at the other. By reference to the actual display of
similar features in the Book of Nature, noting an ever
progressing series of changes, the effect of which only be-
comes visible after long periods of time, we demonstrate
that the dissimilarity between the northern and southern hemis-
pheres, noted by astronomical observations, is precisely analogous ;
and has resulted from an aberration of the position of the earth?s
centre of gravity, from a former centre, and that influences of
similar cogency to effect this, are now in operation in Nature, to
readjust the former centre, and tilt the earth in the opposite
direction upon the plane of her orbit, if not stayed in the
position maintaining perpetual equinox ; a state which Dr.
Young supposes was normal, prior to the Noachian cataclysm,
thus accounting for the then exuberant abundance of organised
life, as disclosed to geological research, in diluvial deposits.
The corrections presently applied to astronomical observations,
are, Ist, Refraction; 2nd, Aberration; 3rd, Gieocentric parallax ;
4th, Heliocentric parallax ; sth, Nutation ; and 6th, Precession ;
of all which phenomena, and influences productive of variations
in accuracy of result, unless we understand their cause, it is im-
possible that accuracy in defining the position of stated points,
and calculating intermediate admeasurements, so as to demon-
strate with absolute certainty the figure of the earth, and relative
dimensions of each part of its exterior surface, can be arrived at.
The deficiency of atmospheric pressure, in the Antarctic regions,
cannot be accounted for by the hypothesis of a greater propor-
tion of vapour there, than in the Arctic regions. Any minor
cause, affecting vaporization, would not permanently affect the
barometer to the extent noted above by Maury. Besides
which, air-borne vapour freezes, and descends as snow or rain,
on reaching air of colder temperature, than capable of sustaining
it in its etherial form. Of the vast area of unexplored surface
within the Southern hemisphere, Dr. Maury observes (1864)
? only think that, in this enlightened age, there is still a portion
of our planet about which we absolutely Tcnow nothing , not even
whether it be land or water, and which is one-sixth as large as
the known habitable portion of the globe.? Yet, totally ignorant
as we are of the height and area of the accumulated polar ice,
science still maintains the theory of depression at the poles, and
carries this constituent of dubiety, if not error, into astronomical
calculations.
Researches in the Book of Nature present us with facts


demonstrative of progressing changes of temperature, noted
geologically, with reference to fossilised organisms, as well as
superficially, at points of opposite position in either hemisphere,
within similar latitudes; evincing, as matter of fact, that the
glacial regions, or polar circles, of which the poles must be the
true centre, are receding south-westward in the northern hemis-
phere, and north-easterly in the southern hemisphere, from the
position upon the earth?s surface assigned by geographers to the
points of the axis of rotation. The real polar centres are thus
apparently advancing towards the position of the magnetic poles.
This change is denoted as the result of another series of
observed phenomena, namely, the continuous accumulation
of ice, as ever augmenting, in vast mountain masses,
within the polar circles, if not having its apex of extreme
altitude at the real poles. The Book of Nature further demon-
strates, that while the southern edge of the great ice barrier to
navigation in the polar regions of the North Atlantic, is con-
tinuously breaking into fragments, which drift southerly, and
the limits of open navigation, north of Spitzbergen, extend to
84| deg. N. lat., the North Pacific Ocean is not subject to inroads
of icebergs from the ice barrier in Behring?s Straits, which, at a
barely perceptible rate of recorded progress, is tending southerly,
and now approximates to the southern limit of the Arctic circle,
as presently defined by geographers. Again, we find _ that
Spitzbergen and Lapland, in Arctic regions, possess a climate
very much more genial than even countries of several degrees
lower latitude, within the North American continent; and many
concurring testimonies demonstrate that the main laud of Cape
Horn, and the islands of Terra del Puego, and the Palklands,
in comparatively high southern latitudes, enjoy, except when ice
drifts approach from the southward, a climate of less severity
than prevails over the greater part of British North America and
north-eastern Asia. Again, in similar latitudes in the opposite
quarter of the Southern Ocean, to the southward of Australasia,
we find the ice barrier reaching into lower latitudes than where
approximating to Cape Horn ; and the climate of Australia has
been geologically ascertained to be passing from the state, or
position, of a tropical climate, to that of a coldly temperate region.
Then, again, we find that, owing to the operation of certain
natural laws of absorption and radiation of solar heat, vaporization
of the surface of the sea in the torrid zone, and copiously watered
tropical lands, and the warmer portions of the earth, amounts,
according to Sir John Herschel, to the equivalent of a shell of
water over the earth of five feet in thickness annually. The
tropical vapours, obeying natural laws, rise to a great altitude,
and after distributing their overcharged surplus of water, by con-
densation, within the region of the ? calms,? the residue, travers-
ing the higher strata of the atmosphere, through or over the
rainless region of the ? trades,? are carried towards the poles ;
where such portion as has not fallen, condensed as rain, in the


temperate zone, meeting air of arctic temperature, freezes, and
descends as snow. The air, thus freed of its burden, then regains
its natural density, as ice cold, and dry, descends to the lower
atmosphere, and recommences its routine of current from the
polar circle, to, and from the tropics, gaining heat as it returns
thither. Thus, a perpetual commerce of heat is maintained
throughout the regions of the atmosphere, while a similar series
of currents of alternately heated, and dense, and cold waters
circulate through the ocean.
Observation demonstrates that oceanic ice, in floes, or broken
masses, of the usual thickness ol the winter season?s growth upon
the surface of the sea in the icy regions, that is, from three to
six feet, dissolves and disappears during the summer, brief as it is,
except where drifted in masses, and piled against the land, or ice-
barriers. The seawater ice is porous and crumbling, while fresh
water ice is capable of hardening by successive thaws and congela-
tions, so as to be so dense, compact, and crystalline, as to reflect,
rather than absorb, the slanting rays of the Arctic sun. Thus?
accumulates upon the piled up ice, until assuming the form?
and increasing elevation, of the ice mountains of the polar
regions, from year to year, and century to century. The longer
continuance of summer by some seven or eight days, in the
Arctic, over the duration of the same season in the Antarctic
regions, produces an excess of the temperature conducive to
local evaporation from the stagnant surface of the sea, during
summer, and to snow storms rather than intense congelation.
Every thaw is quickly succeeded by congelation of the gelid
water from the melting snow, which fills up all fissures and
crevices, as well as the hollows intervening between the loftier
altitudes. In Greenland, the altitudes of the ice mountains of
the interior are notably observed to increase. And Dr. Rink, a
resident, states, that the discharge of water trom the glaciers to
the sea, is but one-sixth annually of the noted precipitation.
Ihe amount ot annual precipitation in high latitudes has not
been adequately tested. At Bergen, in latitude 60 deg. 24 min.
N., 88-6 inches of rain are recorded. It has been estimated,
that twenty-four hours of sun, in polar regions, yield as large a
vapourizing effect upon the stagnant surface of the sea, as twelve
hours within the tropics, while within the polar regions the
precipitation is entirely local. Of the quantity of snow falling
and accumulating during centuries , a faint idea may be formed*
from statistics recently given of a snow storm in the United
States, which fell from one vast cloud in the course of four days,
to the average depth of one foot, over an area of some 1,500 miles
by 300. The weight was computed?at the rate of five tons
to the acre?to amount to more than that of all the wheat
grown in America since its first occupation by Euro-
Thus, every season produces an accumulation of the
polar ice at either pole, but naturally, and unless equalised by
the thawing influence of volcanoes, in constant igneous activity,


resulting in greater deposition in the Arctic than in the Antarctic
regions, owing to the prolonged period of summer ; snow being
observed to Ml most frequently when the temperature of the
atmosphere has been mitigated from a period of hard frost.
Indeed, vapour cannot assume the crystalline forms of snow in
air of the temperature required for extreme congelation, nor
could vapour remain suspended in air of the temperature pro-
ductive of its transformation to snow, so as to reach air strata of
extremest temperature. There is, therefore, no reason to assume
the accumulation of ice mountains at the central points of the
polar circles, or regions, except by congelation of the deepening
sea waters. The accumulation from precipitation must occur
nearer the outer limits of the circles than their centre; natural
influences, consequent upon the configuration of the earth?s
crust, with reference to extent of ocean, accounting for the
observed facts of excess of frigidity of temperature, and accumu-
lation of ice in the south-western quarter of the Arctic circle.
Hence we find a gravitating influence in that direction, obeyed
by the watery envelope of the globe, causing a deepening of its
volume towards the varying centre, and lessening of the
same in the quarters from which the centre has varied.
The excess of accumulation of dense and compact ice, in,
and north of Behring?s Straits, over that in even very much
higher latitudes of the ocean, in the opposite longitudes, north
of Europe, probably results from the greater vaporization of
the surface waters within the western hemisphere, north of
the equator, comprehending the expanse of the Pacific Ocean,
than in the opposite section of the eastern hemisphere, contain-
ing the European and Asiatic, and great part of the African
continents. A similar result must attend the vaporization of
the greater expanse of 'water, in that section of the southern
hemisphere comprehending Australasia, than in the opposite
section, containing portions of the South American and African
continents. Hence we find the great Antarctic ice barrier
approximating to Australasia, and reaching a much lower lati-
tude than to the southward of Cape Horn. Meteorology
demonstrates, that while land radiates the greatest amount of heat
to the atmosphere, yielding a buoyancy, and vapour elevating power,
to its upward currents, the amount of evaporation therefrom,
even within the tropical regions, is small compared with that
from the sea surface, especially within the region denominated
? the calms.?
Accumulation of dense matter upon these points of the earth?s
surface, inducing reciprocity of action by the gravitation of
the watery envelope to the centre of the earth?s volume, must be
assumed by science, in the absence of known compensating in-
fluences, to maintain a deviation of the polar axis, and the con-
comitant result of approximation of the plane of the equator to
the plane of the ecliptic, by a westerly movement, thus accom-
plishing the phenomena of the precession of the equinoxes. The


vast and increasing height of the snowy pinnacles of the Hima-
layas ?in the mild latitude of 30 deg. north, reaching an altitude
of 28,000 feet, or over five miles?induces the belief, that the
accumulations within the regions of continuous precipitation, and
congelation, must attain a proportional and vastly greater height.
Who has penetrated the innermost recesses of these regions,
to acquaint the world with the evidence, furnished by
the amount of deficiency of pressure upon the mer-
curial column, denoting the height within the atmosphere,
above average level of the sea throughout the earth?s surface,
to which the ice mountains attain, that science, in the latter part
of the nineteenth century, dares to assume, and bases calculations
involving the safety of all shipping over the trackless ocean,
upon such assumption, in the face of facts demonstrating accumu-
lation of ice and ocean, to a vastly disproportionate amount, com-
pared with the average surface level of the earth, barometrically
ascertained, that the earth is flattened and depressed at her poles,
and that the polar diameter is to the equatorial diameter as 230
to 231 ?
Again, while called upon to note the apparent accumulation
of water in the southern hemisphere, demonstrated by deficiency
of atmospheric pressure, the denser portion of the atmosphere
being displaced by a rise of the ocean level, a system of natural
tendency to revert to a supposed normal, or former state, of more
equal diffusion of the aqueous covering of the globe, is revealed
to observations in the Book of Nature. A progressive depres-
sion of the surface level of the European seas, to the extent, in
the Baltic, of 26 or 28 inches in the course of this century, and
an elevation of the sea level at West Greenland, to the estimated
amount of four feet in a century, and the deficiency of atmos-
pheric pressure noted by Ermann in north-eastern Asia, are
necessary facts in demonstration of our theory, coupled with the
ever-progressing, though almost imperceptible depression of sea
level in the southern hemisphere, specially observed on the
southern shores of Australasia, and recorded by Dr. Lang
in Phillip's Land, and by a paper read before the Royal
Society of Victoria, ten or more years ago. What cause
can accomplish* over the whole area of the earth?s surface,
these attempts of Nature, at more equal diffusion of the watery
envelope of the globe, but the one noted, ?gravitation to an
altered and ever changing centre of gravity ? This is an im-
perative Natural Law upon all atoms of matter, whether fluid or
solid, whether of the size of an atom, say a boy?s marble, or the
dimensions of the globe we inhabit, or of the celestial orbs
around it. We cannot assume the correctness of the theory of
gravitation at one time, and discard it at another, because its
developed action results in production of forces and their effects,
at variance with our ? prepossessions,? or the deductions of our
early and greatest philosophers. It has very often been stated,
and especially in works of popular science, that astronomical


records from the earliest periods, demonstrate that no change in
the earth?s axis of rotation has taken place; hut, in truth,
astronomers have not demonstrated this. Regarding the facts
from which such assumptions are drawn, from the point of
view taken by an earnest and unbiassed investigator of truth,
they bear a wholly different construction. Astronomers are
in the position of passengers in a vehicle, viewing external
objects in passing. Sir J. Herschell remarks, ?we see them
as they are , though from a station more or less unstable.''''
Yet a theory is maintained, accounting for the movements of
the earth upon the plane of her orbit, and the alteration in
the longitude of celestial objects, with reference to the line of
extension of the earth?s polar axis, by the hypothesis of a grand
revolution of the heavens within a fixed period of 25,868 years,
and the perturbing influences of the sun and moon, or certain
planets, upon a redundancy of matter at the earth?s equator;
while, if the deviation of the earth?s axis were admitted, it
would, like a ray of Divine light, dispel for ever such mysteries
and incongruities, as are now introduced, to gloss over admitted
ignorance of the natural causes. Sir John Herschell adopts Sir
Isaac Newton?s theory of the cause of the lessening obliquity of
the angle between the equator and the ecliptic, termed the pre-
cession of the equinoxes, as being the disturbing influence of
the sun and moon upon the redundant matter accumulated on
the equator; but, when we demonstrate a similar accumulation
at both poles, and a vastly disproportionate enlargement within
the southern hemisphere, culminating to a prolonged apex of
extension at the south pole, what becomes of the hydrostatic
equilibrium supposed to be maintained throughout the action of
Newton?s agencies of perturbation ? It has been stated, however,
that ? although all the planets, primary and secondary, move in
the same direction, their inclinations to the plane of the ecliptic
being small, and the eccentricities of their orbits inconsiderable,
these conditions are not to be regarded as necessary consequences of
the alleged perturbing influences of universal gravitation ; but, at
same time, afford the presumption, while their cause astronomers
are as yet wholly in ignorance of, that the primitive impulse
which determined the directions of the different motions, must
have been communicated to all the planets and satellites, by the
same mechanical cause."
The existing theory, then, of astronomical science, is, that the
diminution of the obliquity of the ecliptic, (the plane of the
Earth?s orbit of revolution round the Sun), arises from the dis-
placement of the ecliptic itself; but that, on the contrary, the
precession of the equinoxes is occasioned, by the continual dis-
placement of the plane of the terrestrial equator, resulting from
the combined action of the Sun and Moon on the protuberant
matter accumulated about the Earth?s equator. The effect, as
described by astronomers, is that the plane of the equator is
constantly shifting its place, in such manner, that the line of the


equinoxes advances in the direction of the diurnal motion, or
contrary to the order of the signs, its pole having a slow angular
motion about the pole of the ecliptic, so slow indeed that it
requires 25,868 years to complete its revolution. The ? True
Theory? now submits that these movements are caused solely by
terrestrial gravitation, as continuously called into action by
operations of nature, in accumulating an enlargement of dense
and ponderous matter, upon a portion of the Earth?s surface
within the arctic circle, resulting in a continuous change of the
centre of gravity of the whole volume of the Earth, which change,
by bringing into operation reactive agencies, continually pro-
gresses in one direction, though not necessarily with invariable
periodic amount. The ? True Theory? thus states a reasonable
cause for these phenomena, of comparatively uniform operation,
in lieu of the complicated, and periodically irregular perturba-
tions supposed to result from influences of the Sun or Moon,
alternately acting, and counteracting, so as to cause imaginary
revolutions. The existing theory of the tidal wave may, possibly,
if subjected to a similar severe analysis of its accuracy, be
assigned from the present notion of lunar influences, to
terrestrial gravitating fluctuations, in part at least. New
theories call for increased observation of natural phenomena.
Astronomical observations of the aspect of the planet Mars,
disclose, apparently, vast accumulations of congealed snow in its
polar regions, and although not noted as observed in the aspect
of the other planets, there is at least a probability of analogous
formations in each, which may furnish ? the same mechanical
cause,? accomplishing the same results, as we educe as in
continual progress in the globe we inhabit, ?the planet Earth.
Sir John Herschell approximates nearest to an enlightened and
independent philosophic view, of the cause effecting the annual
change in the angle of intersection of the planes of the equator
and ecliptic. He regards the result as proceeding from a move-
ment of the earth, but holds that the whole mass of the earth
participates with a fixed axis in the motion of rotation, as if the
axis ? were really a bar of iron driven through it. That such is
the case is proved,? he states, ? by the two great facts?lst. That
the latitude of places on the earth, or their situation, with
respect to the poles, have undergone no change since the earliest
ages ?2nd. That the sea maintains its level, which could not be
the case, if the motion of the axis were not accompanied with a
motion of the whole mass of the earth. Local changes of the sea
level, arising from purely geological causes, being easily
distinguished from that general and systematic alteration, which
a shifting of the axis of rotation would give rise to.? But our
investigations furnish proofs, and quotations* demonstrate, the
untenable character of these assumptions: for?lst. Herschell
admits, that existing calculations of latitude may be proved

erroneous, that a ? more exact knowledge of the physical
structure and figure of the earth, will render a different manner
of considering it necessary.? And ?2nd. The level .of the sea,
or its redundant accumulation in certain quarters of the globe,
and depression of its surface in others, ascertained barometrically,
we have hereinbefore demonstrated to he subject to the ? general
and systematic alteration,? which Herschell admits would prove
a continuous ? shifting of the axis of rotation.?
The justice of Sir C. Lyell?s observation above quoted, respect-
ing the tendency of a false theory to render even philosophers
blind to facts adverse to their prepossessions, is illustrated by
Sir J. Herschell, who in his Outlines of Astronomy, remarks, ?It
is demonstrable, from astronomical records, that no change in the
interval of time elapsing between two successive returns of the
same star to the same point of the sky has taken place ; and with
respect to the permanence of the axis of rotation, the appearances
which any alteration in that respect must produce, would be
marked by a corresponding change in the apparent motions of the
stars; which, again, history decidedly declares them not to have
undergone.? At same time this eminent individual states, that
? no instruments ever yet invented by man, are delicate enough
to indicate, by an increase or diminution of the angle subtended,
that one point of the earth is nearer to, or further from, the stars
than another; the parallactic motion of the axis of rotation with
respect to the stars, is therefore not discernible.? And that
there has been a change in the apparent longitudes of the stars,
as regards their position with respect to the extended polar axis
of the earth, heretofore regarded as a uniformly fixed point, Sir
J. Herschell elaborately explains, as one of the phenomena
of the precession of the equinoxes. He observes, ? the
immediate uranographical effect of the precession of the
equinoxes, is to produce a uniform increase of longitude,
in all the heavenly bodies, whether fixed or erratic;
that is, the apparent approach of some stars and constellations
to the pole, or vanishing point, of the earth?s axis, and recession
of others. The bright star of the Lesser Bear, which we call the
Pole Star, has not always been, nor will always continue to be, our
cynosure. At the time of the construction of the earliest cata-
logue, it was 12 deg. from the pole; it is now only 1 deg. 24 min.
At the date of construction of the great pyramid of Griiizeh, the
longitudes of all the stars were less by 55 deg. 45 min. than at
present.? Thus Herschell, in accounting for the apparent
motion of the heavens, establishes the fact of a movement, which,
if not of the heavenly bodies ?and that it is so is mere conjecture,
?must be of the axis of rotation of the earth itself. Even in
his next sentence, coupled with other evidences, Herschell
affords us the very proofs we want, of the movement or deviation
of the axis of rotation ; for he goes on to observe: ?Of the nine
pyramids of Guizeh, six', including all the largest, have the
narrow passages by which alone they can be entered, situate on


the northern faces of each respective pyramid, inclined to the
horizon downwards , at a mean angle of 26 deg. 47 min. The
supposed polestar of that day, to which the aperture of all these
pyramids must have pointed, was a Dracontis, which must have
had an altitude of 26 deg. 15 min. 35 sec. at its lower culmina-
tion.? The fact of the inclination of the passages, and their
angle of depression, is a striking confirmation of our theory, if
we call to our aid, in accounting for the origin and date of these
monuments, the account given by Josephus, (in Antiquities of the
Jews, Bk. 1., chap, ii., � 3) of the construction by the sous oj
Seth, at a very early period, (prior to Noah?s flood, and foreseeing
it), of two pillars or monuments, to perpetuate astronomical
discoveries ; which monuments were still existing in the time of
Josephus, ?in the land of Siriad.? Sir John Herschell recognises
the fact that, ? modes of rotation of a solid body are conceivable,
in which the poles of the imaginary line, or axis, about which it
is at any moment revolving, shall hold no fixed places on the
surface, but shift upon it every momentbut remarks that,
? such changes, however, are inconsistent with the idea of a
rotation of a body of regular figure, about its axis of symmetry,
performed in free space, and without assistance or obstruction
from any surrounding medium.? But we demonstrate an ever-
growing irregularity of figure, which, though it may not affect
the period of the diurnal rotation in a perceptible degree, must
affect the centre of gravity ; and hence, the poles of the axis of
rotation, causing change of their place upon the sphere, subject,
in amount, to all the circumstances affecting the equilibrium.
Dr. Young supposes that the earth before the flood, enjoyed
perpetual equinox, and observes, that if the intertropical lands
were greatly elevated into the cooler regions of the atmosphere,
the summits being far within the limits of ? eternal snow,? a
cooling effect would he exercised upon the air currents circu-
lating throughout the whole surface of the globe. He remarks
further, that if the seas were concentrated towards the poles,
with an intervening archipelago of islands, in a shallow sea,
between the continents and polar regions, while the intertropical
lands were much elevated, that the climate would be more uni-
formly genial over the whole globe. Such a uniform and genial
climate would account for the remarkable profusion of forms of
organised life, which must have then existed, as evidenced by the
aspect disclosed to geological examination of the fossiliferous
deposits in the tertiaries. The predicted future of our earth is,
that of complete renovation, in aspect, and fertility, with
longevity of its inhabitants ; whose age shall more resemble that
of the trees of the forest, than the three score and ten years,
sometimes prolonged, with labour and sorrow, a few years
longer, which is now the period of man?s earthly existence.
We are not adequately conversant with influences deriva-
ble from magnetic or electric currents in the vaster
operations of nature, to demonstrate their action upon the


healthy growth of organisms affected by them ; but their stimu-
lating and invigorating effects upon otherwise unfruitful seed,
and vegetative power, is well known.
The westerly variation of magnetic currents, and. magnetic
storms, afford a collateral class of evidences in support of the
? True Theory.? The ? True Theory? also furnishes a solution
of the problem of the cause of the great cataclysmal convulsions,
noted by geological investigations as having ravaged the earth,
and transposed its lands and seas, and eroded its great valleys ;
and also solves the problem of the cause of the ever-accumulating
evidences of what was formerly termed the Glacial epoch, but
may now be held to have successively alternated with periods
displaying phenomena of a wholly opposite character, during the
by-past ages of our earth?s history. _ Astronomers claim to have
recently discovered that ages previous to the present era, the
track of the earth?s revolution in her orbit has presented irregu-
larities of progression, or retrogressions; but the fact is, that man?s
knowledge is finite, and such discoveries are mere assumptions
upon the hypotheses accounting for existing movements. Man
can submit no positive proof that, prior to the Noachian con-
vulsion, when last ? the fountains of the great deep were broken
up,? or, as Lucian terms it, ? the oceans overflowed,? our earth
had the same orbit of revolution, or even rotated on her axis in
the same period as now. The reason assigned by the Almighty,
when commanding the solemn observance of the Sabbath, a
complex subject in any other light ?might admit of elucidation, if
day, ?six days ?is held to mean six periods of the earth s
rotation in view of a central sun, as, in by-past very
different conditions from the present may have existed,
whereby maturity of natural objects might be attained
in days, meaning periods'of rotation, of vastly greater duration
than the present. Moreover, the state of perpetual equinox, and
other causes, noted above as contingent possibilities, might have
hastened forward maturity to a degree undreamt of under the
existing aspect of Nature.
We have, in prophetic Scripture, warrant for expecting very
great alterations of surface, as well as general elevation, and
emergence of lands from beneath the ocean, as the aspect, or
new impress of the earth?s crust, after being ? turned as clay to
the seal,? to form the ? New Earth.? Nay, if the passage in
Revelations viii. 8, be a prediction of a literal fact, to be
accomplished, by the conjunction with our earth of a vast meteoric
mass, which shall destroy the third part of the ships and creatures
within the earth?s waters, (a very probable contingency, for the
phenomena of shooting stars is supposed to arise from a belt, or
cluster, of meteoric substances, revolving round the sun, in an
orbit very similar to that of our earth, and at no great distance
from the body of our planet, detached masses, yielding to the
earth?s gravitating influence, becoming visible by combustion,
from rapidity of flight to the earth, through our atmosphere)


the effects produced, of augmentation of our planet?s bulk, and
density, might, besides violently affecting her centre of gravity,
altogether alter, by increase of centrifugal force, her orbit, and
thus obtain for her a new aspect of the heavenly bodies, and ? no
place found for her? in the position, with respect to them, she now
occupies; and ?time,? that is our scale of admeasurement of our
fraction of eternity, ? shall be no longer.?*
Our finite minds can form, (if pei?mitted to consider physically,)
but a feeble idea of the phenomena of the conjunction
of the heavenly city, the palace of the Great King, New Jeru-
salem, which, on the authority of the inspired revelations, con-
tained in the Holy Word or God, is to rest upon, and be
accessible, from the top of the mountains. But, G-iven the
matter for construction of a zone, or ring, to surround our globe,
like Saturn?s rings, or to occupy any designed place in conjunction
with, or proximity to its surface ; the Supreme and Omnipotent
Architect of the wonders of the universe,?ever since ? the
beginning,? working more by the traceable operations in un-
ceasing progression, which we, (adoring the creature more than
the Creator), term Nature, than by special manifestations of
miraculous power, or what we consider creative agencies, (the
word rendered creation, being more properly interpreted origina-
tion of form or aspect, than as signifying made out of nothing,)
?has but to re-employ conditions arising under the great natural
laws of all matter, to accomplish the work designed, in such
excellent form, as of a piece with all the handiwork of the Divine
Creator, beautiful, perfect in structure for the end in view, and
very good. ? When I consider Thy heavens, the work of Thy
fingers, the moon, and the stars, which Thou hast ordained;
What is man, that Thou art mindful of him ? and the son of man,
that Thou visitest him ? O Lord our Lord, how excellent is Thy
name in all the earth.?
* It is recorded that ? on 26th April, 1803, a fiery globe was seen to burst
into fragments nearly over the town of L?Aigle in Normandy. By this
explosion thousands of stones were scattered over an elliptical area seven
or eight miles long, and about four miles broad.? Some astronomers state
that meteoric streams of aerolites travel in the track of comets, and if this he so,
the possibilities of their aggregation, and violent collision with the earth, may
be continually increasing. Comets and their course are as yet but in the
earliest stages of discovery. A remarkably brilliant comet, of nucleus larger
than the rising full moon, and with an immense and brilliant tail, was
observed by us on Christmas eve, 1845, from a locality a few miles east of
Mount Gambier, in South Australia, at a very low altitude above the south
western horizon, from 9to 11.25 p.m. This comet has not been noted by
astronomers. From its extreme southerly declination to the horizon, it
might not be visible, unless under peculiarly favourable, circumstances of
freedom from intervening vapours. We vouch for its appearance as stated,
and, some years ago, furnished particulars to Professor Neumayer.

they overturn the earth.?? Job xii. 15.

It has then been generally assumed as one of the standing facts
educed by the arguments of our earliest philosophy, that the
Earth is depressed in form at the poles of her present axis ot
rotation. Of this, nature affords us no proof, but every natural
presumption against its accuracy ; for, although the velocity of
rotation of an elastic body, cooling from a molten state, might,
could, or should flatten its poles, yet, in this case, the continuous
changes noted, of depositions of strata, and their organic con-
tents, within the earth?s crust, evincing periodical recurrence of
such convulsions, as must have affected her centre of gravity, and
transposed positions of land, and sea, and tropics, and arctic
regions respectively, demonstrate an uncertainty as to the position
upon the Earth's crust now , of the original poles. The earth,
viewed as a mere spherical mass of matter, placed within her
orbit of revolution round a central sun, would naturally oscillate
until every part of its exterior surface approximated to a position
vertical to the centre of gravity of the earth s volume; and
precisely the same effects would take place, in the arrangement
of the fluids enveloping it, as would be the case with any small body,
for all matter is governed by the same laws.
A change in the centre of gravity is necessarily a change in


the axis of rotation. The inevitable results, as well as evidences
of such changes, are the continually progressive alterations in
the relative position of land and ocean, and zones of temperature,
upon the exterior of the globe. These alterations are at first
small, and only perceptible after considerable periods; circum-
stances, such as an increase of primary cause of the changes
successively noted, or an irruption of waters upon some vast
cavity, of which several are ascertained to exist within the earth?s
crust (such as the Great Basin of Central Asia, a vast area from
which, apparently, an inland sea has evaporated, and which is now
greatly beneath the nearest ocean level), or an earthquake, or
other igneous agencies, affecting the stability of, and dispersing
the polar ice, may suddenly destroy the readily adjusting state
of comparative equilibrium, maintained previously, when a great
physical convulsion must ensue, with, as in past geological eras,
complete, or very extensive transposition of sea and land, and
arctic and tropical regions. Lands, now of considerable eleva-
tion over sea level, would be submerged, either wholly, or merely
excepting the lofty mountain tops, wdiich would then become
scattered islands. Elsewdiere, these would be elevated to within
the limits of ? eternal ? snow, while vast areas of presently sub-
merged lands would be brought to light from the ocean bed, and
conjoined to the islands, which then, as lofty mountains, would
yield correspondingly large watersheds, transforming their pre-
sent tiny streams into amazonian rivers, intersecting the new
formed continents, from their inland Cordilleras, to the newly
assigned ocean limits. By flow from such watersheds, as well as
by the irruption of the oceans, simultaneous with a physical
convulsion, have the great valleys throughout the world been
eroded, and choked by sedimentary deposition, alternately, and
the vast river beds traced in our ? deep leads,? channelled, with-
out necessarily protracting the task of their erosion, to thousands
of consecutive years, as has been the view r heretofore adopted by
geologists, as to the periods necessary.
With reference to the origin of some of the more extensive
valleys in England, extending upwards far above the highest
springs that take their rise in them, Dr. Buckland observes:
? It is obvious that such valleys cannot possibly be attributed to
the action of springs or rivers, that now flow through them,
since they often take their origin many miles above even the
highest springs. Their magnitude and depth bespeak the
agency of a mass of waters, infinitely more powerful than even
the most violent waterspouts of modern times could produce.
Their form also differs entirely from the deep and precipitous
ravines wdiich are excavated by mountain torrents; and, if it
should be contended, that the bursting of a series of water-
spouts would be competent to set in action such masses
of water, as might be sufficient for this effect, unless we
can suppose them to have fallen universally, and contem-
poraneously, not only over the district under consideration,


but over tbe whole earth, they will afford no solution of the
phenomena of these, and similar contemporaneous systems of
valleys, which occur in strata that are similarly circumstanced,
in every part of the known world. In North America, effects
visible, similar to the diluvial denudations in Europe, in the
excavation of valleys, the separation of islands from the main-
land, the formation of crags, and serrated ridges of rocks, and
the wearing away of the highest summits, cannot be attributed
to any causes now in action, or to any gradual subsidence of the
waters of the lake (Huron), but must be referred to the great
debacle of a flood advancing from the north.?
Sir Alexander Croke states that, ? the summits of some of the
highest snow-clad hills in Nova Scotia, being composed of slate,
are strewed over with large blocks of granite, apparently drifted
from the nearest granite district, by the rush of waters.? ?In
South America, the sand and gravel found in beds of rivers, rich
in gold and precious stones, are evidently composed of the
diluvial wreck of mountains, shattered by the rush which has
overspread Europe with the detritus of its own mountains.? Of
the larger valleys of the South of England, referred to by Dr.
Buckland, he remarks; ? The main direction of the greater
number of these valleys, is from north to south, that is, nearly in the
direction of the dip of the strata in which they are excavated. The
streams and rivers that flow through them are short and inconsider-
able, and incompetent, even when flooded, to move anything more
weighty than mud and sand.? Besides superficial water-courses,
there is every reason to believe in the existence of subterranean
water channels, in localities having no river outflow ; as between
the Caspian Sea and the Gulf of Persia, in which latter are
often found leaves of trees, unknown, except on the shores of
the Caspian. As long as mountain ranges remain undestroyed,
the valleys and ravines must obviously, be continually enlarged,
either vertically , or laterally, by the action of the waters which
traverse them. The courses of rivers most frequently follow the
escarpments of cliffs, abutting on flat or gently sloping country.
Elevation of the features of a country would wholly change the
character of its river system, by alteration of climate, and con-
sequent immense development of affluents. Of the eroding
powers of water, flowing from elevated watersheds, an idea may
be formed, from the computation of the annual accumulation of
soil, and drifted matter, at the mouths of great rivers. The
Ganges has been computed to deliver on an average, into the sea,
annually, 584,600,000 tons of solid matter; the Mississippi,
292,700,000 tons; and the Irrawady, 102,500,000 tons. No
wonder, therefore, that in course of ages, deltas accumulate, and
plains, as, for instance, our Gipps Land plains, are ultimately
formed thereon.
Thus, besides the denuding and disintegrating effects of the vast
and inconceivable torrents of the oceans, violently displaced, the
subsequent elevation of lands, formerly little over sea level, to


the vast height of perpetual snows, would necessarily give rise
to the formation and flow of mighty rivers, which would
excavate channels of vast dimensions, and hurl along, and
deposit in their beds, the debris of the ancient rocks, from all
parts of their course, denuded by torrents, shattered by chemical
or electric action, sudden cooling after intense heating, by
contact with ice or water, or by any other of the multitude of
agencies usually productive of such effects in nature.
Sir E. Murchison, in Siluria, observes that ? the great sources
of auriferous wealth are depressions, which have been filled with
debris from the mountains, whether coarse or fine. The sides of
these depressions being once defined,? (by knowing their cause,
and the direction of the current which anciently traversed them,
although now perhaps superficially elevated above adjacent lands,
as the bed of the river Po has gradually risen, by deposition
therein, to a position above the plains of Lombardy, through
which the river flows), ?and their bottom being easily ascer-
tained, (?) the period of their exhaustion may be estimated
approximately.? The auriferous shingle, gravel, or sand of the
Ural Mountains has, however, proved poor in percentage, in
comparison with what has of late years been discovered in
California and Australia ; and this, although large nuggets are
occasionally found, butjprobably ? deep leads ? have not yet been
sought for.
Sir Charles Lyell states that gold has nowbeen detected in almost
every kind of rock ?in slate, quartzite, sandstone, limestone, granite,
and serpentine, both in veins, and in the rocks themselves, at
short distances from the veins. Sir E. Murchison remarks:
? The fact is, then, that though gold has frequently been, and is
for the most part found in quartzose, and other veins, which either
have penetra ed or been separated from the mass of the slate
formation, it has also been diffused, in some tracts, throughout
the ivhole bod of the rock, whether of igneous or aqueous origin .?
Again, in Sil ria, Murchison remarks that Humboldt states that
? inGruiana, g fid, like tin, is sometimes disseminated in an almost
imperceptible manner in the mass itself of the granite rocks,
without the r: mifications or interlacing of any small veins,? and
that although quartzose lodes, with ores of iron, yield gold? so do
rocks of aque ms origin. In Mexico, gold is found in porphyry.
The Eev. W. 3. Clarke, of New South Wales, speaks of gold in
felspathic granite, while in Siberia, Hoffman speaks of gold in
clay-slate, obtainable only by crushing the rock. ?In all regions,?
continues Sir E. Murchison, ? where such rocks occur, we may
find gold in fie coarse debris, or the fine alluvia, resulting from
their decomposition. At all events, the indisputable fact is, that
the chief quantities of gold, including all the considerable lumps
or pepitas, ha dng been originally embedded in the upper parts of
the vein ston 3s, have been broken up and transported, with the
debris of the mountain tops, into slopes and adjacent valleys.?
Of course, the distance to which these deposits are borne from


their matrices, or the sedimentary rocks in which they have been
previously compacted, must be commensurate with the force and
violence of the transporting medium?water, whether a snow
torrent from mountains rising far within the limits of perpetual
snow, during one epoch, or temporary convulsive irruptions of the
ocean at another, which causes, together, account for the alterna-
tion of layers of washdirt, in the successive lower channels, or
beds of our ancient river courses, or great valleys, of which mining
has hut begun to disclose the localities of. ? Mr. J. L. Wilson, who
contributed a memoire on the auriferous rocks of the Sierra
Nevada, California, to the Geological Society of London, demon-
strates,? continues Sir E. Murchison, ? that the richest produce
is essentially derived from loose superficial debris, piled up on
the mountain sides and slopes, or in ravines. Mr. Selwyn
(Victoria) considers the auriferous drift is local, and, although
lying at various heights, is usually richest at or near the bottom
of these accumulations.? It is extremely probable it is, but,
query, where is the bottom of these accumulations ? How many
hundred or thousand feet deep must we descend, to reach the
first, or lowest cataclysmal deposit of auriferous debris, whether
in loose fragments in ancient river beds, or compacted in aqueous
rock formations ? Sir Charles Lyell supposes, that gold is of
more modern production than any other metal, but this is mere
conjecture, and, as yet, geologists know very little of the aspects
of auriferous rock formations, at a depth over three or lour
hundred feet, while surface rocks have been so fused,
calcined, and disrupted, by igneous agencies, as to be altered
in structure and metallic constituents; and shattered
fragments of rock so misplaced, as often to present a
? bottom ? to the miner?s shaft on a fragment of the primeval
rock, beneath the surface of which he never dreams of searching,
while the mass he has ? bottomed ? upon, may, perhaps, consist
only of a boulder. Mining in Australasia, will vet demand, and
amply remunerate the services of men of the highest scientific
abilities, to aid in eliciting her golden treasures, and render them
subservient to the a melioration of the condition and prospects
of the brotherhood of man throughout the earth.
To return to our subject, Murchison informs us that feldspar
and quartz, being chief components of rocks producing gold, we
may expect, as a marked feature of auriferous localities, to find,
near the surface, decomposed fragments of quartz rock, and pipe-
clay, which is decomposed feldspar, ?good guides, conjointly, to
localities likely to yield ? leads,? with auriferous washdirt, not
necessarily demanding deep sinking to reach the bed of the
ancient water channels.
Of the vast force a rush of a mighty torrent can exert, in the
removal of soil, gravel, and boulders, and their conveyance to
considerable distances, and deposit in deep chasms, eroded in
solid rocks, which, Interposing a barrier to the rapid flow of the
waters, have been torn through and forced to give way, Mr.


Sumner, in his Records of Creation , Vol. 11., page 350, remarks
as follows:?? When we call to mind the destruction which is
spread by a sudden alteration in the level of a very inconsider-
able body of water, even to the extent of fifty to one hundred
feet, we cannot easily assign limits to the effect of a body of
water, like the ocean, pouring in over the land, when its level
was destroyed: we are at a loss to conceive what the power of
such a machine might be when once in operation.?
Dr. Buckland, in his HeliqidceDiluviance (Appendix), observes,
?We have few opportunities of witnessing by direct experiment
or observation, the force of immense masses of water, in exca-
vating hollows on the surface of the earth, and carrying to a
great distance the fragments which they tear away; and, were
it not for the destruction we occasionally see produced by such
trifling causes, as the bursting of a dyke in Holland, or the
barrier of an Alpine lake, we could scarcely believe that there
are valleys of many miles in breadth, and many hundred feet in
depth, which owe their origin exclusively to the excavating power
of a flood of water.? ?A few miles from the source of
the Missouri, there is a gorge in the Eocky Mountains, ten or
twelve hundred feet deep, and about nine miles long, which
bears marks of erosion by water. About twelve miles
from Washington, there is a similar one on the Potomac,
which is about eighty feet deep, and four miles long; and on the
Columbia (Oregon) Eiver, there is another, which is two hundred
miles long, and on an average, about one hundred feet in
depth; and such, of various dimensions, are to be met with in
every part of the known world. Of the tremendous power of
waves in even a shallow sea, an idea may be formed from the
fact, that during the erection of the Plymouth breakwater, stones
of ten and even fifteen tons weight, were, during a storm, forced
out of buttresses at from four to eight feet below water mark, and
carried over the top of the breakwater, to distances of from fifty
to sixty yards.
When running water is mixed with sand and pebbles, it acquires a
new mechanical power, and these, carried along by streams, grind
down, and excavate the adjacent strata, so that the super-
incumbent portions are ultimately precipitated into the stream.
The obstruction causes a temporary accumulation of water
behind, which afterwards bursts the barrier; and in this way
small ravines are slowly widened into valleys, in which sinu-
osities are caused by the deflection of the stream, first to one
side, and then to the other. The unequal hardness of the
materials through which the channel is eroded, tends also to
modify the lateral power of excavation, and thus the stream acquires
a serpentine direction. These windings occur, from similar causes,
in some of the largest rivers in the world; and not only
in those which flow through flat alluvial plains, but large valleys
* Le Yaux, Records of Creation. London 1867.


are excavated to a great depth, through solid rocks in this serpen-
tine form. These tortuous flexures appear to denote that the
valleys owe their formation to river erosion and deposit, and not
to diluvian agency, which would probably have produced straight
channels. If the materials which streams have to work upon,
are but loosely consolidated, the rapidity with which they some-
times excavate deep channels, is truly astonishing. Alter the
heavy rains which followed the eruption of Yesuvius, in 1822, the
water flowing from the Attrio del Cavallo, cut, in three days, a
new chasm, 25 feet deep. In August, 1829, Aberdeenshire, and
the adjacent counties of Scotland, were visited by a storm, which
extended over an area of 5,000 square miles, flooding the rivers,
which carried away masses of rock of some tons weight, and
transported from 1,000 to 3,000 tons of gravel to great distances
in one day ! In Alpine countries, the moving of massive stones
is facilitated by the ice which adheres to them, and forms, with
the rocks, a mass of less specific gravity. The glaciers also,
formed of consolidated snow, carry down prodigious loads ot
rock and sand, which are generally ranged in long ridges, running
parallel to the course of the glacier. They are slowly protruded
into the valleys, where the ice melts, and the whole accumulation
is swept away by torrents. Instances have recently been noted
upon the west coast of New Zealand, where deposit of moraines,
from the glaciers of the slopes of the mountains, has elevated
ancient inlets of the sea, or sounds, into dry valleys.
The accumulated detritus swept down by rivers, naturally
tends to fill up hollows and valleys. Even lakes in course of
time are filled up, with the exception of the channels cut through
the sedimentary deposits for the continuous outflow. In some
cases rivers raise their beds, where restrained by
either artificial, or resulting from barriers, such as the fad ot
superincumbent masses of rock and earth, upon a part of their
course. The existing altitude of a river bed above present sea level,
is therefore no proof that in earlier ages of its history, it did not
occupy a different position. The river Po now traverses the
plains upon a high mound like an aqueduct, even more ele\ated
than the roofs of the houses in the city of E errara.*
Consideration of these facts, demonstrate the futility of solely
directing geological research to superficial surveys, so little can
be predicated of uninterruptedly contiguous formations, or
metallic deposits, by examination of strata so liable to be
altered by aqueous and igneous agencies. The Eev. W. B.
Clarke, an indefatigable geologist, well known for his contribu-
tions to scientific knowledge of the southern colonies, remarks:
Jt has now been long known, that below our carboniferous
formations, there are well-developed strata of true Silurian age,
* For further illustrations upon this subject, see Lyell?s Principles of
Geology, chap, xiv., from which work, some unacknowledged matter above,
interspersed with our own remarks, has been collated.


which appear to rest against rocks of igneous character of an
older epoch; though the whole of these formations, in these
colonies, have been dislocated, and transmuted, and overflowed, in
numerous localities, by igneous outbursts of a comparatively
recent epoch.?
Mining experience in Australasia has proved, that our chief
discoveries of auriferous treasure, have either been in these
upheaved and overflowed portions of the lower strata, dislocated
by igneous outbursts, and more or less disintegrated by action of
the causes we have heretofore considered, during successive
epochs in the ages of Australian antiquity ; or diluvial and
alluvial deposits in the ravines and great valleys, from these
dislocated and disintegrating gold-bearing rocks.
Having now discovered the cause, and continuity of operation,
of the great convulsions of nature, in the effects of which,
Australasia has, in common with all the rest of the globe, had its
share, we have an explanation of the successive deposits, (as in
ancient river beds, separated by vitrified rocks of basalt and sedi-
mentary accumulations, so as to lie in alternate layers, from the
surface-wash downwards, till the water-bearing strata beneath
forbid further search, or the primitive rocks are bottomed upon)
of water-borne boulders, gravel, and minerals, in valleys now
only capable of feeding petty streams. We may also presume,
on good premises, that in every great natural valley, bearing evi-
dence of the ancient eroding power of water, by its structure
and rock-bound limits, however filled up, even to the aspect of
plains by recent formations, if proceeding from, or funked hy, gold-
hearing rocks, there is the locality of ? deep leads,? whether such
valleys are based upon, or cut through, carbonaceous or sedi-
mentary strata, or the oldest rock series. The position as to
depth from the surface of auriferous wash, noted on the Ballarat
gold-field, has demonstrated how close to the surface soil, these
ancient watercourses ?for the overflowing of waters? may
be traced; and there can be ho question as to the
fact, that the discoveries in and adjacent to the great
Ballarat valley, are but in their commencement. If the great
interest of mining in these colonies, as the chief attraction to
population, the proper source of revenue, and dispenser of wealth
and prosperity, ?as well to the future nations, of which the early
colonists are but the nuclei, as to the commerce and industrial
production of the world, ?receives its due share of Legislative
support; and research be directed, upon scientific principles, and
by adequate appliances, ?which may henceforth exercise the
engineering skill of the world to profit,?there need be now no
limit to the wealth realizable from shallow or ? deep leads.?
Boring operations, instead of the present hap-hazard and expen-
sive mode of exploring by ? drives,? at certain levels, in search
of known leads, ?the course of which cannot be guessed until
struck by chance, the ancient stream having, possibly, falls in its
course ?are especially indicated; and there is no geological


reason why the ancient valleys of each of the Austrr lasian settle-
ments, as well as gold-hearing countries in other parts of the
world, such as the Ural, should not, henceforth, he made to dis-
gorge the treasures in their successive ancient channels, or
? deep leads.?
In New Zealand, the experience of the practical miner in the
large river beds, points to the continuous disintegr; tion hy snow
waters, of the gold-bearing rocks, and deposition of their debris,
in the present and former beds of ravines and rivers, flowing
through, or flanked by, the carbonaceous rocks : in fact, the coal,
or lignite, though not systematically worked, is used by the
miner, as well as the pastoral tenant of the Crow)., as his only
fuel in some localities in the province of Otago.
Giold is found in Borneo in the crevices and cells of limestone
rock, and very probably might be found similarl;; situated, in
south-eastern "parts of South Australia, particula ly near such
outbursts of igneous rocks as occur between the Glenelg and
Penola. See Sarawak, by Hugh Low, Secretary to Eajah
Brooke (1848). Mr. Low remarks The loamy red earth,
found in small quantity in the bottoms of the caves, (in Borneo)
is taken up carefully and washed, yielding on an average, one
and three quarters of an ounce per bushel. Each cave usually
yields from six to twelve bushels. Gold is pretty generally
found in the alluvial throughout Borneo.?
The Victorian Departmental geologist has recently published
opinions adverse to the probability of discovery of ? deep leads,?
except in immediate conjunction with, and resting upon, gold-
bearing rocks, but it must be regarded as possible to account for
their deposit, on the mere mechanical principle of the motive and
erosive power of water, whether from elevated snowy watersheds,
or the irruption of an ocean, violently displaced. In view of the
mutations the rocks of Australia have undergone, as noted in our
quotation from Bev. AV. B. Clarke, we fear that as yet A ictorian
geological explorations have been too superficial, to be of any
great practical value. It is evidently impossible for any geologist,
however practical, and experienced, to determine the course,
extent, dip, or inclination, and intrinsic value, in other words,
payable quality, of erupted, dislocated, and overflowed masses
of rock, whose natural order and geological position is far
beneath the sedimentary formations rising to the earth?s
surface. Extensive and closely noted researches, by boring,
might do /much to assist investigation , but as to determining the
position and extent of cross dykes, and veins, or drifts, in solid
rock strata, Geology, manifestly, cannot effect this with precision,
calculated to be of any great value in aid of the researches of the
practical, and ordinarily experienced miner. The labours of our
geological staff might, by extending their scopv of research, be of
immediate and practical value in enlarging the sphere of develop-
ment of our mineralogical treasure. AVhat value to future
generations will so called geological survey maps assume, however


carefully planned and beautifully executed, if not containing
indications of the locality of mines, quarries, deep and shallow-
gold deposits, and other of our varied metaliferous or mineralogical
resources, just as likely to be hereafter found by the practical
miner in erupted strata, or beds of ancient watercourses long ago
obliterated by sedimentary matter, as in the uniform order of the
igneous and aqueous formations, so elaborately charted for us,
but a blank, as regards notification of probabilities of such dis-
coveries? Mr. Selwyn being a recognised scientific authority,
we subjoin his opinion, though differing therefrom,* as regards
the prospect of discovering gold leads, deep or shallow , (in regard
to depth of sinking) in the ancient valley beds, eroded in sedi-
mentary formations. Before proceeding to additional quotations
from other geological authorities, in refutation of his doctrine, we
premise one query. In view of the mutations the earth and its
rocks have undergone during geological convulsions, without
reference to their cause, and it being demonstrated that water
can excavate a deep channel through lava?often the hardest
basalt, why must we not presume upon erosion of water channels
through the newer carbonaceous rocks, with a deposit of debris of
erupted gold-bearing rocks, borne by tumultuous floods into
depressions of their beds ?
Evan Hopkins, E.GKS., author of a treatise on gold-mining,
* * * * * ? Referring to the probability of deep leads of gold under-
lying the Gipps Land plains. One of the primary essential conditions for
the existence of leads of gold, is that the superficial deposits forming the
plains should he underlaid by the gold and quartz-hearing slates, &c., of the
Silurian formations, without the intervention of any newer formations, such
as the coal-bearing rocks that extend from Westernport Bay to Traralgon,
&c., and the (probably Devonian) rocks that form all the high country from
Ben Cruachan and Mount Wellington, eastward to the Mitchell about Mertun
Creek and Lindenow. Now if we draw a line from the Moe to Heyfield,
thence to Ben Cruachan and Mount Wellington, and thence south-easterly to
Lindenow and the coast, the whole of the country lying south of that line is
most certainly underlaid by rock belonging to one or other, or even both of
the newer formations before mentioned, and therefore though small particles
of fine gold might be found over the level country, brought down, as you
suggest, by the rapid streams that take their rise in the slaty gold quartz-
bearing ranges to the north, it is highly improbable, if not indeed impossible,
that rich leads would be found inside or south of the line indicated. I am
tolerably well acquainted with all the Gipps Land rivers, having personally
examined portions of all of them, including those you mention. I have also
examined the plains and the surrounding ranges, with special reference to the
probable extension of goldfields under the plains, and this examination enables
me to predict, for the reasons above mentioned, that there is no probability
whatever of any such extension. On the enclosed map I have drawn a black
line, AAA, round the country I refer to, and inside this line there is, in my
opinion, no probability whatever of remunerative gold workings being dis-
covered. The two rough sections show below the way in which the rocks lie,
and how under the country referred to, the gold rocks are buried far beyond
the reach of the prospectors? pick or boring rods. ?I have the honour to be,
sir, your obedient servant, A. R. C. Selwyn. You are at liberty to make
any use you please of this letter, or to show it to any of the gentlemen who
wish to prospect for deep leads on the Gipps Land Plains. To Mr. N. W.

and who enjoyed great opportunities of studying auriferous for-
mations and deposits, here, and in South America, remarks that,
? Gold, platina, and other metals, not subject to oxidation, are
frequently found in the debris of a certain variety of granites,
porphyries, and their respective clay slates. These productions
depend on the composition and structure of the primary crys-
talline rocks, and the degree of richness in which the metals are
disseminated therein, and the internal chemical action by which
joints and crevices are becoming gradually filled with metals, or
are crystallized in the oxydating superficial exfoliations of the
rocks. These superficial productions of gold and platina
especially, far exceed the qualities obtained from veins, and the
metals thus extracted, are much purer than those produced by
the latter. We likewise find that auriferous rocks are much
subject to decomposition, and thus to producing and liberating
their metallic contents in the divisions of the exfoliated surfaces,
and only rarely in great fissures or lodes, like the sulphurets of
the baser metals ; and even in these rare cases, the precious metal
is found mechanically mixed in lodes of iron pyrites. This
superficial process of metallic aggregation and decomposition in
the auriferous rocks, is constant, more or less, in every region on
the face of our globe, depending entirely on mineral and physical
conditions, confined to no age nor to any particular zone.?
According to Sir Eoderick Murchison, (quoted in Page?s Text
Book of Geology), ?the most usual original position of gold is in
quartzose veinstones that traverse palaeozoic slates, frequently near
their junction with eruptive rocks. Sometimes, however, it is
also shown to be diffused through the body of such rocks,
whether of igneous or of aqueous origin. The stratified rocks of
the highest antiquity, such as the oldest gneiss or quartz rocks,
have very seldom borne gold, but the sedimentary accumulations
which followed, or the Silurian, Devonian, and Carboniferous,
(particularly the first of these three) having been the deposits,
which, in the tracts where they have undergone a metamorphosis, or
change of structure, by the influence of igneous agency, or other
causes, have been the chief sources whence gold has been derived .?
In the above quotations, the opinion of the first European
authority upon questions of geological importance, appears
decidedly contradictory of that stated by our provincial geologist,
as to the rock matrices affording what the one terms ? the
chief sources ? of gold, and the other mentions as ? rich leads,?
or ? remunerative gold workings.?
Of the Devonian or Old Bed Sandstone system, Page states
that, ? the igneous rocks most intimately associated with the sys-
tem are greenstone, clinkstone, compact felspar, felspar- porphyry,
amigdaloid, and other varieties of felspathic trap. The traps
occur chiefly as upheaving and disrupting masses, and are them-
selves cut through by later dykes of greenstone, felspar, and
porphyry; thus seemingly indicating a cessation of volcanic
action during the main deposition of the old red sandstone, but a


period of great activity and disturbance both at its commence-
ment and its close.? During these igneous periods, gold may be
derived from other rock formations, and compacted into the con-
glomerates or ferruginous sandstone, in both which we have
obtained specimens.
Dr. lire, a man of large scientific attainments, and accustomed
to compilation from authentic sources only, remarks of gold that,
? the mineral formations in which it occurs, are the crystalline
primitive rocks, the compact transition rocks, the trachytic and
trap rocks, and alluvial grounds. It is, however, much more
common in the alluvial grounds than among the rocks. It is
found disseminated under the form of spangles in the siliceous,
argillaceous, and ferruginous sands of certain plains and rivers.
* * * The Ticino affords gold only below the Lago Maggiore,
and consequently far from the primitive mountains, after
traversing a lake, where its course is slackened. The Ehine
gives more gold near Strasburg than near Basle, though the
latter is much closer to the mountains. The sands of the Danube
do not contain a grain of gold while this river runs in a moun-
tainous region, but its sands become auriferous in the plains
below. The same thing is true of the Ems: the sands of the
upper portion of this river, as it flows among the mountains
of Styria, include no gold, but from its entrance into
the plain at Steyer, till its embouchure in the Danube,
its sands become auriferous, and are rich enough to be washed
with profit. * * * The auriferous sand occurring in Hungary,
almost always in the neighbourhood of the beds of
lignites; and the petrified wood covered with gold grains, found
buried at a depth of fifty-five yards in clay, in the mine of
Yorospatak, near Abrabanya, in Transylvania, might lead us to
presume that the epoch of the formation of the auriferous alluvia,
is not remote from that of the lignites. The same association of
gold and fossil wood occurs in South America, at Moco. Near
the village of Lloro, there have been discovered at a depth of
twenty feet, large trunks of petrified trees, surrounded with
fragments of trap rocks, interspersed with spangles of gold and
platinum. But the alluvial soil affords likewise all the characters
of the basaltic rocks ; thus in France, the Ceze and the Garden,
auriferous rivers, where they afford most gold, flow over ground
apparently derived from the destruction of the trap rocks, which
occur in situ, higher up the country.?
The auriferous deposits in most parts of the world, indicate
their transit, by a tumultuous rush of water to considerable
distances from the original rock matrices: the gold assumes the
form of flattened scales, or small rounded fragments, with occa-
sional nuggets of every variety of form, and from a
few grains to several hundred ounces in weight. Some-
times, in the vicinity of quartz veins, pieces of gold, as
beautifully frosted or foliated, as if prepared for inspection as
chef d' oeuvres of art, are discovered, frequently united to frag-


ments of quartz or ferruginous rock. In the Victorian deep leads,
the depth of deposit of water-worn debris of rocks, based upon a
reef, or bed of pipe clay, varies from a few inches to twelve feet.
The average yield of gold is said to be from half an ounce to two
ounces per cubic yard. Auriferous leads, deep and shallow,
would probably be found in all localities of the globe where
alluvial deposits have been heretofore worked. The description
of the alluvial mines in every part of the world, discloses a
similarity of aspect and form of the deposits therein. In
Victoria, no workings of quartz reefs, or deep leads, have yet
been prosecuted to a depth, much, if at all, exceeding 600 feet,
and there can be no question of the fact that, by our present
hap-hazard mode of search for leads, by shafts and drives, enor-
mous expense accrues without certainty of accomplishing an
adequate scrutiny from the surface downwards. In the great
Ballarat valley, there may, very probably, yet be proved some
twenty or more ancient and separate river-beds, being really the
successive depositions of alternating geological epochs. And a
similar result may be predicated concerning the Bendigo valley,
and in fact almost every great valley, upon the surface, or in the
upper strata of which, alluvial gold is found. Of these, there are
hundreds within Victoria alone, many of which are as yet wholly
unexplored by the miner; and of most of those yielding most
largely near the surface, popular belief of the futility of seeking
deep leads therein, or the immense expense of shafts and drives,
has precluded adequate search.
Throughout Victoria there are numerous instances, observable,
of great changes having occurred, in the elevation and position
of the successive beds of valleys ; and depositions of water-worn
pebbles and debris, commonly termed, in miner?s phraseology,
? wash-dirt,? noted even on the topsof hills of an elevation above the
average of the ranges around. Again, some of the valleys through
which our streams and rivers flow, disclose, by landslips, or
excavations, beds of washdirt many score of feet above the bed
of the present watercourses, which have evidently been eroded
by cataclysmal torrents at later periods. Thus, on the high bank
of the land abutting at the junction of the Moe river, (or swamp)
and the Latrobe, there is such a bed of washdirt, or ancient
river channel. Similar indications are observable at various
points in the great valley of the Yarra, which has proved richly
auriferous wherever tested ; and we believe will yet, from the
source to the mouth, yield from its successive beds, amounts of
gold that, if named now, would appear inconceivable and
fabulous. The southern banks from Hawthorn to Punt Hill, have
disclosed, to almost every deep excavation, a washdirt of quartz
boulders and gravel, with detritus of other rocks and pipe-
clay ; and the same deposit is observable in the face of
the cuttings in the western part of the city of Melbourne.
Had our individual means admitted, we should long ere now have
tested the valley between Plinders-street and the Immigrant?s
Home; where the shelving slate rocks confine the valley to limits


not greatly exceeding its probable former volume, when flowing
from a sierra, elevated, perhaps, some thousands of feet above our
mountain ranges now, and, consequently, far within the limits of
? eternal ? snow. Perhaps, however, ? the time was not yet
come ? for a vast development of the boundless riches of auri-
ferous wealth in Victoria , calculated to attract all the world.
When the time does come, for the accomplishment of this part
of the great designs of the Almighty Euler of the Universe,
we shall see here, and probably at now no distant date, a far
greater rush of capitalist population to share our golden treasures,
than at the first discovery of gold. And even our past accumu-
lations of wealth, and its continually increasing abundance, will
not suffice to keep moving the immense impulse given to mining
enterprise, but this will attract to, and locate amongst us, the finan-
ciers of Europe, with their vast resources. The field is large, if
confined to Victoria , but it is but one of the countries indicated as
abounding in great valleys, adjacent to rocks yielding gold, which
will disclose, to adequate search, ? deep leads.? Some may fear
depreciation in the value of gold must ensue, and, to a certain
extent, this must be the case, from its greater abundance; but it
will still be the vehicle of financial interchange throughout the
world ; and until wars shall cease, and the arts of peace alone
flourish, in an empire of peace, so long will gold be intrinsically
precious, and available in the aggrandisement of nations, as well
aa individuals, and enable them to sustain their temporal power
and influence.
The task of the scientific and practical geologist, to be regarded
as of greatest importance, in the early development of the
resources of the country, should now be to endeavour to trace
the limits of the ancient valleys ; within which, researches by
boring must be directed, to discover the successive leads, which
have traversed them. As elsewhere observed, some of these
valleys have, subsequent to deposit of wash containing gold,
been subjected to submergences beneath the ocean, during
certain geological epochs, and at other periods, to alluvial
deposition,?as river beds, or while in the position of deltas
at the seamouths of the now tributary streams. Hence, by
successive diluvial and alluvial deposits, and the levelling
action of the rolling waves of the sea, and its superincum-
bent pressure during submergences, with exposure to magnetic
currents, inducing development of igneous agencies at one
time, and infiltration of calcareous or other concreting matter
at another, the substrata have been compacted into layers of
alternate rock, and earthy matter; which, partly denuded of the
disintegrated surface, by the waters of the last cataclysm, while
fresh channels have been opened for the outflow .of the head
waters, form our level or undulating plains. Evidences of such
affecting causes of variation of formation, are observable in most
of our Victorian valleys, where they open out widely below the
junction of the mountain gorges, and ravines; and also may be
traced where there are now no lofty elevations, or escarpments,


marking their original or former site. In some cases, chance
boring alone might disclose their situation, and traversing
leads, in the successive formations ?as even the geologist
may well he at fault, where there are few or no superficial land-
marks observable. But there is ample scope for almost
unlimited mining enterprise, within the valleys now traversed
by our larger rivers, more especially where there have already
been discoveries of alluvial deposits containing gold, on, or near
the surface. The researches of Dr. Hibbert, noted in his work
on the Extinct Volcanoes of the Basin of the Lower Rhine,
demonstrate, that during the convulsions which have marked
each geological era, changes in the beds of the great rivers have
been a common feature ; therefore, although the hypothesis of
elevation of mountains, to the altitude of a snowy watershed,
would account for the vast deposits of ?wash-dirt? in the Ballarat
valley, it may be stated at the same time, as not impossible, if
not highly probable, that some of the presently large tributaries
of the Murray, may have traversed the Ballarat, and adjacent
valleys. The course of the Muddy Creek, flowing through a
remarkable gap, or almost perpendicular split in the mountains,
to the northwards, till it joins the Groulburn at Yea, its first
course being parallel to the Yarra, and very close to it, until it
abruptly turns at right angles, seems to indicate some such
change having there occurred. The late Sir Thomas Mitchell,
Surveyor-General of New South Wales, referring to a locality
therein, observes ?? There must have been greater currents than
now, or else countless ages of time must have elapsed for the
gradual abrasion that could have worked out such channels,
leaving deposited the particles of gold which must have been
once shut up under seven or eight hundred feet of solid rock.?
The result of some of the affecting causes of change in the
aspect of valleys, and alteration in the level of their stream beds,
are strikingly illustrated in the valley of Tulloh?s Creek, Mount
Cotterill, near its crossing by the old road from Melbourne
to Ballarat. The adjacent undulating plains owe their super-
ficial aspect to successive eruptions of lava, and pumicious
rocks, ejected from the crater of Mount Cotterill. The surface
soil is chiefly decomposed volcanic rock earth, in which these
erupted stones are embedded at various depths, mingled
with seams of calcareous matter, and occasional beds of lime-
stone, probably owing its formation to a period of submergence
after the igneous outbursts above referred to. The ravine con-
taining the present channel of the creek, appears to have been
primarily excavated by a cataclysm from the north. The stream
itself is of tiny proportions, flowing in a narrow gutter worn in
the basalt. High on the brow of the hill, some sixty feet or
more above level of the present stream, a recent cutting, to
form an approach to the bridge, discloses the ancient bed of a
larger watercourse, trending in the same direction as the ravine,
or from north to south. There is here a large deposit of wash-
dirt, resting upon solid basalt. The appearance betokens its


golden quality, and, were it on Crown lands, it would probably
support a considerable mining population; gold being found in
the creek. There is a surface wash of quartz gravel, barely nine
inches deep, spread over the north-eastern face of the ravine,
which has been derived, by denudation,from the ?lead,? or deposit
of washdirt above-mentioned, situate just beneath the most
elevated part of the rocky barrier, or escarpment of the ravine,
as it now exists. Where, then, must we look, in localities
of similar for the successive beds of the ancient
streams ? The flow of cataclysmal torrents being little varied
from north and south alternately, and the amount of deposit
marking one such catastrophe, being small, except during
periods of submergence, after which the sedimentary matter
would probably?where not immediately thereafter vitrified
by igneous agency, or cemented by calcareous infiltrations?
be easily eroded, the probabilities are in favour of the successive
leads being discoverable, between the ancient watercourse nearest
the surface of the plain to the north-eastward, and the present
channel of the creek, or limit of the escarpment of the ravine on
tlm south-west, and thus it would probably be in all similar
ravines or valleys.
Gold is but one item of the mineralogical wealth of Australasia
awaiting development. Silver, lead, tin, copper, and other metals
are known to abound, requiring only financial enterprise to place
their production in the list of profitable undertakings. Coal
our local geologist discourages the search for, in Victoria, main-
taining that there is no probability of a seam worth working
being found* so deep and extensive have been his researches i
In Tasmania, however, and in New Zealand, valuable seams are
known to await the reproductive enterprise of the capitalist. In
\ ictoria, titaniferous iron ore abounds in vast quantity, capable
of manufacture into ?an unprecedentedly fine quality of iron
(and steel), having the property that a heat of it can be puddled in
sixty minutes, which is just half the time per heat which the pro-
cess of puddling usually occupies, while the loss of iron in the
process is only one-fourth of that usual. Moreover, this titani-
ferous iron has the remarkable property of completely resisting
the action of hydrocloric acid.? The resources of the colonies
are only now being made known. Ere long, however, they will
present, in all reproductive departments of legitimate enterprise
the aspect of numerous concentrated hives of industry the
Britain of the Southern Hemisphere.
It is much to he regretted that our departmental Geologist has considered
it his duty, thus to discourage local coal-mining enterprise. Recently in-
formation of an out-crop of apparently good coal, in the Wannoni near
Hamilton, was contemptuously rejected, as ?no discovery at all,? because the
locality had been previously charted as carboniferous, hut not of an age to
yield payable coal The gold miner, reporting discovery of a rich reef, and
app ymg for capitalist co-operation to work it, would not appreciate? very
kind!y such a mode of prognosticating and decrying its probable quality,
without practical investigation, or intimate knowledge of the precise locality

A grave responsibility will now rest upon the Governments of
colonies, as to devising suitable measures of preparation tor ab-
sorbing the probable European exodus of population, fleeing
from increasing internal troubles, and dread ot participating in
predicted evils; which will, apparently, be more severely ex-
perienced within the limits of the ancient Eoman Empire, than
in remote parts of the world; and more especially, those parts
from which the source, or agent of desolation, which is to over-
whelm the other part, is withdrawn. It is manifestly impossible
to define what localities may be spared, when ? the slam ot the

There are some very remarkable circumstances, worthy of con-
templation, in the apparently providential development of induce-
ments to European colonization of the remoter colonies, which
we may here refer to. The countries of California, the La
Plata,* and States of the Argentine Confederation, with the
settlements of Southern and Eastern Africa, and Australasia,
have always presented large inducements to location of agricul-
tural and pastoral immigrants. The apparently casual discovery
of gold in some of these countries, and, possibly, the ultimate
discovery thereof in all, may perhaps one day be proved to be
the means employed by the Almighty, to attract and locate
population speedily , when His own time for it arrives.
Gold has been proved workable on the surface in many places,
and thus was scarce covered by the grassy sod, from view?often
in goodly nuggets?of the earlier colonists. In California, the
discovery of the precious metal was made amongst the washed
stones ot the banks of a saw-mill race, or artificial dam supply-
ing it, some years after that country had been geologically
examined, and reported upon, as to its mineralogical resources, by
l - ^ana > who failed to demonstrate the discovery, which,
when afterwards casually made, resulted in the concentration of an
enterprising mercantile and agricultural, as well as mining
TtrLM ll ' a^so h as ft been throughout the Australasian colonies.
While disproportionately tainted by the felonry tran-
sported to them, the ?set time? of the Lord God
of Providence had not arrived. When the way was
prepared for location ot a well regulated and virtuous
people, and the higher, institutions of civilization and religion,
amply provided, tor at least the nuclei of great nations, together
with ample supplies of the more necessary articles of food, the
discovery was no longer retarded. In Victoria, as well as in
y".ew South Wales, hints had occasionally been given of rumoured
discoveries of gold in the mountains of the interior, but the
news was not credited. Even specimens shown were generally
regarded as mere proofs of spoils still existing in the hands of the
felonry of the lower population, a large portion of which was of
convict origin, and the material itself referable merely to the
melted fragments of broken-up jewellery and watch cases,
loreover, the article of native gold was understood to be the
royal perquisite; and thus contraband , and only to be searched
tor and if found, appropriated, at the risk of being chargeable
with felony. However, when in the colony of New South Wales,
the large mass of quartz and gold, afterwards known as the Turon

nugget, was pointed out in situ to Dr. Kerr, by an aboriginal on
his sheep station, and shortly afterwards purchased by the local
bank for �4,000! the excitement of the previously incredulous
population knew no bounds. Previous to this, gold had been
found in the mountains of New South Wales, and reported by
the discoverer, Mr. Hargreaves, but the quantities were so com-
paratively small, and the ground so patchy, as not to have caused
any great attraction, except in New South Wales proper. After
the Turon discovery, however, homes and settled avocations were
hastily abandoned, and multitudes left, or prepared to leave the
adjacent colonies, to flock in search of similar masses of the
glittering object of allurement. In Victoria, industrial pursuits
were all but suspended, and a wholesale exodus seemed in-
evitable, had not information been communicated to the local
Government, on 7th June, 1851,* at the commencement of this
crisis, of a locality where surface workings for gold had been
successful within the colony. The information got abroad, and
simultaneous with the report of the party sent to ascertain the
truth of the information, other discoveries were reported, and,
very shortly, the tide of emigration had turned, and migrants
from all parts of the world came flocking in, and wealth and
prosperity became the lot of all. It is extraordinary to relate,
and unaccountable ?unless on the hypothesis that to serve a
wise providential purpose, the bait should be in the highest
degree alluring, and, therefore, intuition was granted in the
search for it, ?but it is th e fact that the gold was then apparently
found wherever reasonably searched for, and not in paltry
pennyweights ; but in ? pockets ? of some hundred ounces, at
the bottom of mere surface shafts. The proverb, ? where-
soever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered
together,? was speedily exemplified. God?s own time
had only now arrived. How else could the massive
glittering nuggets of virgin gold have escaped notice, where
afterwards found, scarce hidden by the grass roots, in localities
turned over by excavations of the pastoral tenants, in former
occupation of the gold-fields, as squatting stations? They
sunk post holes, water holes, and wells ; made sheep wash dams,
artificial creek channels, &c,, and yet neither they nor the abori-
gines before them, ever hit upon the wealth, often close to their
feet, and which, when searched for, was readily obtainable by the
most inexperienced miner, with often a minimum amount of
labour. Afterwards, when the Divine end was seemingly accom-
plished ; and for a period, the land was adequately populated,
* This was some weeks before the discovery at Clunes, which is usually
alluded to as the earliest discovery of gold in Victoria, and has been liberally
rewarded as such, while the actual first publisher of the first actual discovery,
whose bona fide claim is vouched for by his early correspondence with the
Government of that period, has been, for lack of parliamentary interest,
treated as yet, and for a long period of years, with neglect ; and his
reasonable to share in the rewards, so munificently lavished upon others,
thrust aside. See Appendix (A). ?

industry, and perseverance, have long since been satisfied, and
left the country to successors, far behind them in mining
experience and other elements of success. Our present miners
are, except where employed steadily by the mining companies,
very migratory in their habits. Their average success is little
more than a livelihood, and they are lavish and improvident, and
too rarely can combine labour and means in the more profitable
operations, of which large numbers have recently been abandoned,
when on the eve of successful working, owing to temporary want
of confidence on the part of the capitalist coadjutors, with the
working discoverers.
In local institutions, and matters of general utility to the
country at large, these colonies have now again taken a steady
stride of advance. In fact, our institutions are nearly all upon a
liberal scale of adaptation to the requirements of a population
much in excess of the present, or even of what might be reasonably
expected within a few years to come. In this lavish provision
for the future, some see only the working of the ascribed ambition,
and extravagance, of our legislatures, and subordinate depart-
ments. AVe look higher in seeking trace of the influences
inducing human action, and believe that a wise and overruling
Providence, knowing the end from the beginning, is but pre-
paring the way for a vast and speedy influx of population, without
overwhelming inconvenience, or necessary demoralization to the
existing colonists, or occasioning deprivation to the new arrivals,
likely to react unfavourably upon the steady flow of immigration.
The visit of H.E.H. Prince Alfred, appears also an event in
Providence, preparatory to the same issues. By representations
of no ordinary visitor could the inducements \ve can hold out
to location of the highest ranks, or wealthy financiers, be dis-
played to the favourable notice of such, throughout Europe, so
advantageously, as by the record, and after circulation of facts
concerning our social condition, and progress, and our boundless
resources,?-only requiring capital and confidence to develop
them?elicited and brought prominently to view, during the
residence of the Prince.
Pears have been currently expressed, that the late cruelly
murderous attack upon the young Prince, our guest, and the son
of our gracious and well-beloved Queen, will do more harm to
the reputation ot the colonies, as well regulated communities
offering large inducements to accessions of population, than the
previously favourable notice, and publication of advantages,
resulting from the hospitable entertainment of the Prince, would
do good. But we may be permitted to hope, that the burst of
indignation and execration with which the outrage??wherever the
news has yet reached?has been greeted, will demonstrate how

foreign to our habits of thought, and repulsive to the prevailing
current of popular feeling, such demoniacal actions are. And
whether the current alarm of Fenian, or other insurrectionary-
treachery, and lawlessness, be well-founded, or, as we still hope,
quite unfounded, there will doubtless be prompt measures inaugu-
rated, to crush within, or banish from amongst us, every symptom
of turbulent or refractory insubordination to the benign law and
sovereignty under which it is our privilege, as British subjects, to
dwell. G-ood may thus emanate from what at first appeared
unmixed evil. Our land may be promptly and thoroughly
cleansed from the presence of the lawless and seditious, and
avenues for the local spread of their doctrines, so pernicious to
the body politic of our population, be wholly closed and sealed;
so that in the future we may tangibly demonstrate, without fear
of contradictory circumstances arising, that immunity from all
things subversive of the privileges granted under the British
constitution, and British law, may be confidently calculated upon
as the portion of all immigrants, who may desire union, and
naturalisation with us, as fellow-subjects under British sove-
reignty. We doubt not that everything , even this diabolical and
apparently damaging outrage, will be overruled for good to us,
and for the promotion of the great designs of Providence in
respect to the future of Australasia. The subject has been
already mooted with respect to the confederation of these colonies
for mutual defence ; and perhaps we may yet hope to rally round
the person of a member of our royal family, and in firm adher-
ence to him, and respectful affection for his august mother,
obliterate the remembrance of past grievances and political
animosities, or religious and party dissensions.
The recent appointment of scions of our British noble families,
to the position of Giovernor of various Australasian colonies,
may be but another step in the routine devised by Providence,
for the accomplishment of infinitely wise purposes of mercy to a
remnant of our race. The most exalted personages of Europe
may yet gladly seek a quiet home amongst us, ere troublous
events and times supervene, amidst the political atmosphere of
Europe. The future of Australasia, Gron alone can foretell. Ere
long, the progressive physical changes upon the surface of the
globe may, of a sudden , altogether alter the configuration of the
lands we occupy. But it seems probable that a great destiny, as
one of ? the nations of them that are saved,? is before us. Our
legislatures and people will do well to initiate, and bountifully
encourage legitimate schemes for the employment of capital and
labour, in manufactures, &c., calculated to render us independent
of the great seats of commerce in other parts of the world.
An elevation of our ideas to realisation of the sublimity of the
work to which we are called, as the human agents to be used in
accomplishment of providential designs of sparing mercy to a
portion of our race, should exercise an immediate and wide-spread
influence towards conciliation of political animosities, presently


a barrier to useful legislation, calculated to promote and render
reciprocally available to the world at large, our indigenous sources
of wealth, advancing prosperity, and social and political privileges.
A great feature in our land legislation should consist in induce-
ments to concentration of population, so as early to develop social
requirements, and hasten the formation of institutions, rendering
widely available to extending municipalities and communities,
the advantages derivable from a state of progress in the arts and
institutes of Christian civilisation. To effect this, the land should
not be laid off in such localities as required for agriculturists in
too large blocks: and care must be taken that mere speculators do
not monopolise portions so as to retard close settlement. If
desirable, to alienate, by sale, large blocks for pastoral occupa-
tion, which, however, we demur to as impolitic, such lands should
be only those not suitable for agricultural purposes, and unlikely
to prove hives of mining industry. Yet, who can say now where
mineral wealth may not have been deposited during the great
periodical convulsions of nature ? If such occurrences were not
so clearly indicated by every research devoted to the recesses of
the Book of Nature, we might be longer content that our geo-
logical staff should continue merely overlooking, or at best but
scratching the outer cuticle of the Earth's crust , and laying down
sage deductions from appearances thereon presented, as to the
deeper internal structure, or probabilities of the existence of
valuable coal basins, or of deposits of washed fragments of dis-
rupted rocks and their mineral constituents. Such superficial
investigations are far behind the scope of knowledge, with which
science has now to grapple ; and the results of crude opinions
formed theron alone, are disastrous to mining enterprise, which
rather requires stimulus and departmental encouragement.
Judicious legislation must ere long be resorted to, to place our
great resource of mining upon a basis for better management,
control, and realizable direct return, as revenue to the State.
Legislation, as to right of mining upon private lands, has been
too long delayed, and we have now too many conflicting interests,
to render the question of Crown control over it of easy solution.
But, one principle might yet be established, that discoveries of
?leads,? made depart mentally, shall entitle the Crown to a
royalty upon the produce of all claims hereafter worked upon
such leads: and in alienating unproved lands, the rights of the
Crown to all mineral wealth, beneath a certain depth, should be
fully reserved. If mining be now judiciously prosecuted, and
with becoming energy, the mineralogical resources of the Austra-
lasian colonies will be far more speedily developed, and the pros-
perity and best interests of the people served, by the reservation
of the right of mining the leads of ancient river beds, by the
Crown, except as farmed out to companies, or individuals, proving
the possession of adequate capital to work them advantageously,
after due test of their quality, and extent, by Government ex-
ploration.


We ought now to be more cosmopolitan in our preparation
for an extended immigration. We should be open to receive a
sprinkling of all nations ?the future universal brotherhood of
the family of man. Everything in legislation likely to cause
antagonism * between the several classes of our local producers
and consumers, should be carefully repealed, and, in future,
avoided ; and while no effort should be omitted to diffuse
enlightenment, religious or educational, and restrain social evils,
if not eradicate them wholly, civil and religious _ liberty, and
protection, must, to entitle us to rank amongst the list of nations
of liberal policy, tending to steady progress, be extended to
migrant groups from every nation. The colonies now languish
for lack of fresh immigration, but we are on the eve of a great
change, and our now superabundant food will shortly be wanted
for our home consumption. Should our theory be admitted,
circulation of the inevitable deductions, must appear the great
duty of all philanthropists. Even then, such is the incredulity
with which mankind views all matters relating to the future, we
might despair of the result, but that the God of the Universe,
by the word of His inspired prophet declares (Hosea ii. 14),
? Behold I will allure her (the people of Zion, or Christendom),
and bring her into the wilderness (or remote place), and speak
comfortably unto her.?
The recent discoveries of new leads in the Ballarat valley are
strikingly illustrative testimonies to the truth of the ? True
Theory,? and discoveries of the most exciting character are now
continually being reported throughout Australasia. We foresee
that Queensland will, ere long, be enabled to demonstrate her
possession of rich leads throughout the beds of the great valleys,
as well as upon their surface. New Zealand, from its lofty
watershed, presents greater difficulties to the deep lead pros-
pector than are met with in the dryer climate of Australia ?but
engineering skill and appliances will obviate most of such
difficulties, and there is certainty of an immense and amply
remunerative return. Terrace-mining, here, as on the West
Coast, in cemented black sand, may, ere long, be initiated. By
boring operations, the expenses heretofore thought necessary to
adequately prospect for leads through substrata, such as sinking
shafts, slabbing these, then driving and timbering, often at great
outlay, and necessity for expensive pumping engines, would be
saved, at all events, until the discovery of a lead of adequate
extent and promise justified such outlay.
Besides Australasia, other countries in similar latitudes within
the southern hemisphere, now present increasing inducements to
immigrants of capital or industry. Recent accounts state that
diamonds of the first water, and great value, have lately been
found on the Orange River, Cape of Good Hope. The local
excitement is said to be very great, and people of all classes have

gone out in search of them. G-ems are not unfrequently found
among the minerals of greatest specific gravity forming the
residuum, left, with the gold dust, on the ripples of the long-toms
and sluice boxes, among the Alpine gold-fields of Victoria ; but
comparatively few of the miners are sufficiently careful in their
manipulations, or adequately experienced in the appearance or
value of the rarer gems, or, ere this, another valuable item would
have been added to our exports. Pearl fisheries and other
allurements are also tending to populate the Pacific Islands.


APPENDIX.
Note (A).
CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING THE DISCOVERY OF GOLD, IN REFE-
RENCE TO CLAIMS OF THE EARLIEST GOLD DISCOVERERS, IN
VICTORIA.
Legislative awards, voted in Victoria, for publication of discoveries of gold-
fields, have been dealt with most capriciously. At one period, large sums
have been granted as rewards to parties originally found monopolising the
whole benefit of their discoveries, which they selfishly kept secret, until, being
watched, followed, and their place of operations ascertained, it was, in miner?s
phraseology, ?rushed? by a body of diggers, determined to share its advan-
tages. At another period, rewards have been, despite protests, lavishly
showered upon re-discoverers of localities, which had, years before, been pub-
licly notified and profitably worked. For instance, information was published
in the Melbourne Herald, in January, 1852, of a new auriferous locality east
of the Dandenong ranges, giving particulars of the route thereto, which
resulted in the place being for a time largely resorted to, until some new
locality, as has often been the case with regard to all the diggings, attracted
its population. In 1859, another party of miners entered the old workings,
for the re-discovery of which they obtained large rewards, to the exclusion of
the first publisher of the discovery, seven years before. Again, in 1861, the
first publisher of the discovery of workable gold in Victoria?by letter to Mr.
Latrobe, the Government Superintendent, dated 7th June, 1861, an incontro-
vertible evidence of the fact, as being then placed on record?set forth his
claim to some consideration, among the other rewarded gold discoverers, but
was coldly met by the reply that, as his discovery dated prior to 1860, it could
not be attended to; yet, notwithstanding his protest, a large reward was then
granted for the so-called discovery in 1860, of the fact published in June,
1851, as to workable gold in a stated locality. Again, in May, 1864, Parlia-
ment voted �IO,OOO for reward of gold discoveries in that year, resulting in
the location of population. A proclamation was duly gazetted, setting forth
the conditions and mode of publication requisite, under the hand of the
then Minister of Mines. One, if not more, discoveries were duly reported
to the local wardens, and to the public, through the press, resulting,
in one case, in the permanent settlement of a local population, and
beneficial results in opening up a series of new gold-fields in pre-
viously pathless forests. However, the Legislature were shortly after-
wards involved in what has proved an interminable dispute, as to the
right of despotism of one House over the other in questions of finance;
consequently, the voted amount was permitted to lapse, as not specially
awarded?-the matter appearing to the bond fide discoverer, a dishonourable
repudiation of his equitable claim, unless, perhaps, merely overlooked for a


time by the Legislature.* Such neglect of just claims, is scarcely calculated
to foster the researches of any who have not means at hand to turn their
discoveries to their individual advantage, or who might be disposed to devote
their services to the public, on the chance of meriting a reward. The past
mode of considering claims, however, if continued, may readily be taken
advantage of by the selfish monopolist, who first seeks to engross the wealth
he discovers, and only assents to the publication of the results of his discovery,
when his secret is extorted from him. Then he comes before the public as
its benefactor, and, by influence or ??palmistry,? for (proh pudor) a manoeuvre
termed ? lubrication,? is reported as a by no means impotent agent in Vic-
toria, it is to hoped in a rapidly narrowing circle (Isaiah xxxiii. 15, 16),
succeeds in obtaining a reward and position, he is alike unentitled to. The
wise king Solomon perceived the evil, and declared it in Ecclesiastes ix. 15, 16,
as to the result to the obscure claimant. The maxim enjoined in Exodus xxiii. 8
has been forgotten apparently, in some cases, in dealing with questions
referable in Victoria, to ? man that is in honour, and understandeth not ?
his accountability to God, as well as to his fellow-man, for the equity of his
conduct and decisions.
At the present day, viewing the result of the gold discovery throughout
Australia as a matter of general benefit, it is difficult to comprehend at first
sight, the apprehensions of ruin and general calamity which affected the popu-
lation of Victoria, when the discovery of gold in New South Wales in the first
instance, attracted our population hence, and, by its abstraction, threatened
Victoria with the total destruction of all local industrial and commercial pur-
suits. We find in an old number of an extinct Melbourne periodical?the
Illustrated Australian Magazine ?an admirably written paper (supposed to be
from the pen of the Hon. T. T. a?Beckett, then, as now, an able contributor
to the literature of the day), so thoroughly apropos to our views of the provi-
dential character of the gold discovery in the first instance, and now of the
further discovery of the universality of ? deep leads,? as well as affording
reminiscences of the disastrous primary effect of the Bathurst discovery upon
the state and prospects of Victoria, that we extract a few paragraphs. We
may suppose this paper to have been penned in the end of May or early in
June, 1851, Melbourne magazines, in the early days, rarely appearing until
the middle or end of their current month of issue. At its date, no information
as to a local gold-field appears to have been made public. The first pub-
lisher of a local discovery communicated, as before stated, with the then Acting-
Governor, Mr. Latrobe, upon 7th June, 1851. His Honor?s reply, dated 11th
June, demonstrates, by the incredulity with which he received the intelligence,
that he had, up to that date, received no confirmatory information from any
other quarter. The documentary evidence of the correspondence with the
Government of the day, and concurring testimonies, were moved for, collated,
and laid before the Victorian Parliament some years ago, their source?the
Chief Secretary?s office?admitting no cavil as to their authenticity. Yet,
although Victorian legislators are readily found to support the renewed
claim of the man who originated the alarming crisis in Victoria , culminating
in June, 1851, and who has already been munificently rewarded in Victoria
as well as in New South Wales, scarcely one yet volunteers to support the
claim of one of her own colonists, to credit of, or consideration for, the first
publication of the fact of existence of local treasures; which, when investi-
gated, and proved by the resulting succession of discoveries, turned the current
of population to, instead of from, her shores, and raised Victoria from her
* According to the stated opinion of the Attorney-General upon a similar
case of alleged right and equity, the vote of �IO,OOO having been reported to
and adopted by the Assembly, from that moment, in constitutional law, and
public honesty, this money became the property of the discoverers of gold in
1864, whose constitutional right thereto is, in the said opinion, stated to be as
perfect and as complete as any salary secured by a permanent Appropriation
Act. It remains, however, to be proved whether there is not in this a dif-
ferent law and public sympathy for the obscure colonist, merely developing a

primarily depressed state and prospects, owing to the prevalent exodus to New
South Wales, to her present position of pre-eminence amongst the colonies of
Australasia. The solution of the geological problem of the origin , and deduc-
tions hence of the probable localities of the ancient river beds, or leads of auri-
ferous deposits, must now raise a host of competitors in the emulative race for
future national pre-eminence in Australasia; but we must sooner or later con-
federate for mutual defence, and form the United States of Australasia.
Extract from the Illustrated Australian Magazine for June, 1851 (Melbourne).
?THE GOLD MANIA.
??There are times and seasons in which the clearest judgment becomes
clouded, in which the most mercurial temperaments lose their elasticity, and
the man, whose bearing is ordinarily joyous and inspiring, becomes taciturn
and subdued, the once vigorous suggester sinking into the helpless listener.
At such a time, the imagination dwells with painful pertinacity upon things
uncertain and obscure, filling up their misty outline with gloomy details,
presenting in the aggregate a distorted phantom, which cannot be contem-
plated without dismay. That which at times befalls individuals, is sometimes
suffered by a whole community, producing, if unchecked, a state of panic and
an amount of suffering, secret and acknowledged, enough to make the very
angels weep. It generally follows some halt in a rapid and prosperous career,
some fundamental change in an order of things, under which comfort and
prosperity had, until then been enjoyed. We, the good people of Melbourne,
are somewhat in this condition. We are, many of us, fearful that, because
gold has been discovered some hundreds of miles away, our splendid pastures
will smile no more, our oxen no more be strong to labour, that our sheep and
cattle will diminish, our streets be desolate, and we ourselves be constrained
to hunt for shining particles of dust in a barren and a thirsty land, or lead a
Robinson Crusoe kind of existence, living in solitude upon sheep that own no
shepherd, and cattle that have none to tend them. For ourselves, we are
under no alarm, and as we would talk cheerfully and hopefully to a dispirited
friend, whom we believe to be morbidly depressed, so will we talk over this
matter with you, our gentle public, fully meeting and discussing every
point on which you are apprehensive.
?We admit that the gold discovery is, in its immediate results, highly
inconvenient. We live in a thriving and happy land, where there is no
surplus population, where every man is, or if he choose may be, of some value
to his fellow man?where we cannot afford to part with one well-ordered
person?it may be that, for a time, the labour required for our city, our towns,
and our stations, already insufficiently supplied, will become much scarcer,
and that a check will of necessity be put upon every work that is not abso-
lutely indispensable. *****
? A more serious question, however, suggests itself with reference to the
fascination of the gold, upon pastoral and agricultural labour. There are
some, who gloomily imagine that this will be altogether absorbed, and that
our fields will be for a period of time deserted, and our sheep and cattle
become dispersed and destroyed. We have no fears on this score ; we believe
that the farmer will find means of sowing his grain, and the squatter of pro-
tecting his flocks and herds, even though farmer and squatter be deserted by
all now about them. It may demand much personal energy, and a consider-
able increase of expenditure, but we feel assured that what is required will
nevertheless be done. It is well for us to know, that the power which laid
low the army of Sennacherib, in a single night, may destroy us in the midst
of plenty, but we hope and believe that there are among us, men enough
here, who do not bow the knee to Baal, to prevent the infliction upon us of as
signal a chastisement. *****
? We are doubtless experiencing, even already, a great alteration in the
state of our domestic trade, and by a sort of tacit understanding, it seems to
be taken for granted that every species of property has undergone a terrible
diminution in its market value. This, we take upon ourselves, to state at
once, is the result of panic, of a vague notion that Melbourne is about to be
depopulated, and that, in a few weeks, almost every description of property
will be sent for sale to a mart, where not a buyer can be met with. * *


? Now to apply all we have urged upon our readers, to the great subject, of
which we as a people are absorbed in the consideration, we believe that the
existence of the Bathurst gold-field has been providentially revealed, so as to
attract to this thinly populated continent, the people it is capable of support-
ing in happiness and comfort. We believe that myriads will hasten hither,
allured by the prospect of metallic wealth, who will find, when they arrive,
occupations more fitting to their characters, and more useful to their
countrymen, than that of mere metallic accumulation ?we believe
that gold will be found in sufficient abundance to procure for
this favoured land in rich profusion, all the comforts and elegances
of civilised life in addition to the more primary blessings, which are
now within the reach of us all; that the treasures we have laid open, will be
sufficiently abundant to gratify every reasonable desire, but not so enormous as
to produce, as some prognosticate, surfeit and death. For our own colony?
our own Victoria, even though no gold field he discovered within her fertile
territory , possessing as we do, the means of creating to an almost indefinite
extent, that for which gold is freely given, accompanied by the inestimable
blessing of a splendid climate and lovely scenery, it would be a libel upon our
nature, not to believe that it will possess attractions, which will outweigh in
permanency those of the land of ore. We are strong in faith as to the almost
immediate advent of an era in our history, which will shine with a brilliance,
that will utterly pale that, which even now is sufficiently strong to attract the
attention of a civilized world.
? We do not come to this conclusion on any speculation as to what we may
discover in our own territory of metallic wealth, although there seems to be
no doubt that it is rich in mineral resources. With reference to gold our
explorers have, as yet, done nothing but illustrate the lines of Juvenal?
I, demens, curre per Alpes
Ut placeas pueris, et declamatio fias:
and we are by no means desirous that as to gold they should accomplish more
than the mission suggested by the satirist.?
[lt is clearly evident from these latter sentences that up to date of this
article, no account of a local discovery had been submitted. Who, then, first
published information of the local discovery, if not the neglected claimant,
proving correspondence with the Government early in June, 1851 ? The
Committee awarding premiums, voted by the Legislative Council in 1856, to
the early gold discoverers were (if the local newspapers at the date of the
respective discoveries are to be regarded as faithful chroniclers) subjected to
mis-information, by statements (probably from memory) as to the dates of
these discoveries, or notifications of the fact of discovery to the public.
On 15th July, 1851, Hon. William Campbell wrote a letter to the Hon. James
Graham (Graham Brothers), of Melbourne, merely stating then that gold had
been discovered ? within a radius of fifteen miles from Burnbank,? Pyrenees.
This letter was published in the Melbourne daily press of 22nd or 23rd July.
Gold was discovered in the Plenty river on 26th July, and at Anderson?s
Creek on 6th August. The Rev. W. B. Clarke?s pamphlet on the Discovery
and Working of Gold, was reported as in the press, by the Melbourne Morning
Herald of 7th July, being his vehicle of notification to Victoria that gold
might reasonably be looked for within certain meridians. In the face of such
easily tested facts, why should the credit , as well as the substantial reward for
valuable services to the State, due to one of our own colonists, for information
of the discovery on 7th June, 1851, be handed over to the foreigner, Mr.
Hargreaves, whose aspirations, in his disclosures of locality of gold in Hew
South Wales, are not demonstrable as in any way favorable to the early or
continuous progress of the province of Victoria ?]
?Gold-hunting is not, per se, a desirable occupation. Its success is
not dependent upon moral worth, and it has a tendency to destroy
rather than promote the observance of those rules of conduct, which,
while they contribute to worldly welfare, elevate the individual who
practises them, and promote social happiness. It is this deteriorating
influence, that constitutes the drawback to an otherwise almost unmixed


good?a drawback so serious that, persuaded as we are of our obtain-
ing an abundant share of the Australian gold, wherever it may be found, we are
by no means anxious it should be turned up at our very doors. Our prognos-
tications of prosperity are founded upon the immense impetus it will give to
the production of that great staple of industry?wool; and the influx it will
occasion of a vast population, who will soon find sufficient to supply their
natural wants, and who will then, in obedience to the laws of our being,
conceive fresh desires; to gratify which, all the energy and genius of man
will he offered in exchange for the gold given for our superabundance of the
necessaries of life.
? The limits of a monthly magazine will not admit of our discussing at
length, the great principles involved in the question as to the influence of gold
upon a people?s welfare. We will only state broadly that gold does not con-
stitute wealth, although, by common consent, it represents it; that the richest
country is that, where food and the materials of raiment exist in the greatest
abundance,?these constituting advantages that will draw to them every art
and luxury that civilization has produced. We believe that the discovery of
gold in Australia will immensely augment the exchangeable power of the
real wealth of Yictoria; and that, as a necessary consequence, it will, not only
greatly increase the prosperity of our own colony, but add materially to the
welfare of the world. * * * * Well indeed will it be if, in the general
prosperity, ? class ? animosities disappear. We cannot all be great, but we
all may be united, and like the stars above us, though moving in separate
orbits, pursue our alloted path without jarring or collision; forming here
below a system as noble and harmonious, as that which the firmament above
discloses to the astronomic vision.
?We are not sanguine as to the immediate advent of a state of general
prosperity and social amity, but we, in common with all believers in revela-
tion, look to a period when these will coexist with a universal reception of
Christian truth. It may seem fanciful and visionary to imagine any connec-
tion, however remote, between these discoveries that are now startling the
world, and the great event which the Christian believer expects one day will
be developed; but we cannot help feeling that they are calculated to bring
about a state of things which is likely to precede it. We may expect them
to induce an immense diffusion of mankind, under circumstances highly
favourable to the production of physical comfort, by the encouragement
they will offer to the exercise of art, and science, in the rapid
creation of the luxuries and products of civilization; not hy the
instrumentality of mere human bone and muscle, but that of
the steam-engine and the laboratory. We believe that the time will come
when unskilled labour will be superseded by mechanical inventions ?when
men, enjoying in rich abundance the bounties of nature, will be employed in
the grateful application of its principles to the development of the useful and
the beautiful, accompanied by a practical carrying out of Christian principles,
of which the beauty is now acknowledged, while their authority 's too often
disregarded. How far the incidents in the world?s history, which are now
forcing themselves upon our contemplation, are calculated to bring about a
state of things such as we have described, we must leave to the speculation of
our readers; they bearing in mind that, while the ways of Providence are
inscrutable, they are planned by infinite wisdom, and will assuredly lead,
though it may be in a way we wot not of, to the ultimate happiness of
man.??(Signed)??T. A. B.?

ON CERTAIN LAWS, AS ADMINISTERED IN VICTORIA, ANTAGONISTIC
TO UNITY, HARMONY, AND GENERAL PROGRESS, AND PRO-
SPERITY, OF HER RURAL COLONISTS.
In Victoria, the operation of the Land Act, in regard to leasehold rights of
lands containing valuable improvements, and of that for Prevention of Dis-
eases of Animals, create a most injudicious antagonism between
the various classes of Crown tenants. Much of this might, and ought
to have been avoided, had the Upper House more closely scrutinized
their provisions, and exercised a fellow feeling with those likely to be strongly
affected by them. Unfortunately, however, the members of the Upper
House have few ideas in common with the smaller Crown tenants, whether
squatters or selectors, hence clauses sanctioning the most cruel and arbitrary
proceedings, have become law, involving very questionable advantage to the
community at large, and great hardships and losses to individual interests.
The bulk of the members of the Upper House, have large squatting pro-
perties in the adjacent colonies, or are large land holders in Victoria, and
appear to care but little for the ruin of the pastoral interest in Victoria, so
long as unitedly powerful enough to maintain a policy, giving them perfect
free trade, whereby they sell their produce in the dearest market, and buy
articles of consumption in the cheapest, without contribution to the revenue,
by tax on their wealth, or luxuries, or by way of protective impost, in favour
of the Victorian Crown tenantry, who, after paying, perhaps ten times the
amount of New South Wales Crown rents to the Crown in Victoria, are
subject to be undersold, and utterly ruined, by the illegitimate competition of
the producers of the adjacent colonies. Even so far has the influence of
the squatting magnates of New South Wales prevailed, that a law for the
prevention of a disease in sheep, termed scab, with provisions of severity
unequalled in perhaps any other civilized and enlightened nation upon earth,
has been passed and perpetuated with scarcely one well-considered effort to
modify the inequity of its operation. The disease is one which every owner
of sheep would be only too happy to eradicate, and prevent risk of its attack?
affected sheep neither yielding payable fleeces, nor attaining marketable
condition. The cruel injustice perpetrated in name of this renewal of the
barbarities of the Goths and Vandals, under cover of being the law of the
land, is continually furnishing cases of appeal to the superior courts of law,
which, happily, are almost always responded to by mitigation of the penalties
imposed. Sometimes, however, the unfortunate victim of loss through the
Providence of God, has not the means, or neglects to appeal in time. He,
perhaps a recently settled selector of a crown allotment, or, mayhap, a small
proprietor of land, desires to combine grazing with his agriculture. We shall
such a one to demonstrate the working of this ill-advised act,
antagonistic to the social harmony, progress, and prosperity of the small
farmer in Victoria, and as presently carried out, certain in the very nature of
its machinery of operation, to fail of the desired results?the extermination of
the disease, as presently existing, and prevention of its reappearance from
infection, which a well-judged and equitable law could be framed to accomplish,
within a given period, without hardship to the well-meaning colonist.
An owner of a snug farm of a few hundred acres, purchased, in the public
market, a flock of sheep ; at his request, the district sheep inspector examined
them, and on his ?assertion that they were clean, and free of apparent taint of
disease, they were purchased on terms of usual credit, security being taken
for their price on mortgage of the farm. But ten days had elapsed, however,


when the same inspector re-examined the flock, and pronounced that an acarus
was visible upon one, and hut one sheep. He might have got it on his micro-
scope, or clothes, in handling sheep at the last place he visited, hut ? to the
best of his belief, he might say certainty, it was obtained upon the farmer?s
sheep.? The farmer, being prosecuted as the law directs, was forthwith fined
two shillings each for every sheep in his flock! Strange, that such a system of
putting down disease, was never yet applied to human ailments. In place of
the benevolent ministrations by the good physician, and the dispensary, the
father of ten children, of whom one falls sick of contagious disease, should,
applying this sheepowner?s law, be fined, say �lO for each child in the family,
and be sold up, or sent to gaol for a few months, in default of distress, or rather
to complete his misery, and plunge his family in heart-breaking distress.
Such was the fate of our poor farmer. The sheep were killed, and their car-
cases sold, at a great loss, by the mortgagees, who then came upon their chief
security?the land. The poor farmer was utterly ruined, and no interest per-
manently benefited. Penalties under this law, subject the offender, that is
the unfortunate owner of the sheep, who has not detected the one acarus
in the one infected sheep in his whole flock, until pointed out by the
more experienced inspector, (whose advantage it evidently must be, not
to permit the disease to become obsolete in his district, however great his
conscientiousness may be) to incarceration, not as a debtor, but in association
with, and subjected to all the punitory degradations to which the criminal
prisoner is liable. What wonder, should his affairs collapse during his impri-
sonment, if he degenerates from an enterprising useful colonist, to a soured
misanthrope, or adds to the number of the broken-hearted, who drown their
sorrows and dissipate alike their energies, and their means, to gain the brief
elysium and lasting woe of the drunkard P
Happy would it be for Victoria if her elect representatives in the halls of
legislation, would but more closely study the interests confided to their trust,
and watch with adequate circumspection, lest the general interests of the
Victorian colonists be injuriously affected, by carrying out enactments pri-
marily, and insidiously framed for the chief benefit of the adjacent colonies, or
mere sections of the local community; or, lest by crude any
interests be fostered, which may develop into antagonism to our ultimate
coalition with adjacent colonies, and future progress as a great, united, and
harmoniously working nation. Eventually, all intermediate boundaries of
provinces may be abolished, and the Australian colonies, at least, confederated,
upon terms admitting no future separation of interests. But, until such a
result is arrived at, each colony should conserve, strictly and primarily, the
interests of its own people, without undue sympathy for any class,
and least of all, for one class at the expense of another.
