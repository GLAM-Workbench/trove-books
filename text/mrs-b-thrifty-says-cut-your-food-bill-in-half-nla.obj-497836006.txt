The Fruit may be Bottled in Water
or Syrup as desired
PACK the Fruit into the bottle, fill the bottle with WATER
or SYRUP, put on the rubber ring, then the cover, and
finally the spring clip. The filled bottles are then
placed in the Sterilizer. Water is put into the Sterilizer until
it reaches about three parts of the distance up the sides of
bottles. The Sterilizer is placed on the gas stove, fire stove, or
oil stove, and heated until the temperature is indicated on the
Thermometer at such registration as given in the Book of
Instructions for the particular fruit or vegetable being bottled.
After the temperature has been maintained for the specified
time, according to the instructions, the bottles are lifted out,
generally with a pair of bottle tongs, and are placed on a
shelf or table to cool. The next day, when the bottles are
thoroughly cold, the clips are taken from them, and the
covers will be found to be automatically hermetically sealed
during the sterilizing process. The contents will keep in-
definitely.
A Copyright Book of Instructions accompanies each Outfit,
g.ving the necessary temperatures and other data for success-
fully Preserving all kinds of Fruit, Vegetables, Fish, Meat and
Poultry in the Vacuum Bottles.

The preservation

so largely prac-
tised that we feel
sure the Fruit
Juice outfit will
be welcomed by
the housewife. It
enables her to

directions are con-
tained in the Book
of Instructions ac-
companying the

The “Vacola” Fruit Juice Extractor
This Extractor is very ingeni-
ously designed from a pattern
used extensively in Italy and
Southern Europe, where Pure
Fruit Juices are the popular
drink during the Summer season.
The Fruit is placed in the Ex-
tractor- which stands in a bath
of water, which is kept boiling
during the process. The steam
ascends through the Extractor
and draws the whole of the juice
from the fruit, leaving nothing
but the skins and seeds. The
juice is diverted to an inner
chamber in the Extractor and is
drawn off through the tap at the
side. Instructions are supplied
with each Extractor. For ex-
tracting the juice from Grapes,
Raspberries, Black or Red Currants, Pineapples, etc. The “Vacola"
Extractor fills a long-felt want, and when used in conjunction with the
Fruit Juice Bottling Outfit illustrated above, a supply of delicious
Pure Fruit Juice can be preserved for use at any time.

bottle manufacturers. They are specially suitable for bottling Sheeps’
Tongues, Pressed Meats, Chicken and Fruits for show purposes.
Storage of Fruits for Jam
Making, etc.
(5 lb., 4 in. mouth)
Ideal for Storing Fruits
for Jam Making
The No. 65 Bottle is especially suitable
for hotels, cafes and households to pack
quantities of fruit unsweetened, so that
the contents may be emptied from the
bottle and made into pies or puddings,
exactly the same as with freshly-
gathered fruits, the sugar being added
to taste when used. The housewife finds
this an admirable bottle for storing
fruits for jam-making. It holds about
5 lbs. This is a handy quantity, for, with
the addition of 5 lbs. of sugar, it can be
made into 8 or 9 lbs. of jam. House-
wives will see the advantage of this,
as the fruit can be put down in the
fresh state, without the necessity of lay-
ing in large stocks of sugar, and can be
made into jam in the cool weather, as
required.
