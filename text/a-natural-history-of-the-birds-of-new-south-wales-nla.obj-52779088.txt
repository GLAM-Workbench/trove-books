Lewin, John WiLLiAM,|~-Naturalist who painted the first hooks on Natural History prepared
in Australia. Arrived in New South Wales in 1798, and died there in 1819. North
has written about him in the Rec. Austr. Mus., Vol, VI., pp. 121-125, and I have
given a couple of notes on the first books on birds in the Emu, Vol. XII,, p. 19, 1912,
and Vol. XV., p. 33, 1915.
Birds of New Holland with their Natural History, Vol. 1., 4to, London, 1808.
-North has quoted a prospectus note that it would come out to, Sydney by the next
boat, published in Sydney, Nov. 20th, 1808. This first edition has the Latin names
of the birds, and in the Preface, which was written by his brother Thoa. Lewin, it is
stated : “We have retrenched the descriptions of the Birds in this work, from what
was intended by the author to be given.”
As the book is exceedingly rare I give here the contents ;
It is fairly obvious that the identifications and references to Latham were made at
this end and that the Latin names were also given at the same time, being merely
equivalents to the names used by Lewin. Only six of;the eighteen are not accredited
to Latham, viz., Meliphaga chrysocephala, Turdus pectoralis, Turdus cristatus, Sylvia
dorsalis, Sylvia solitaria, and Reed Warbler. Errors of identification are seen in
Pipra gularis and Sylvia cyanea.
The genus name Meliphaga dates from here and I have discussed the name in the
Austral Av. Rec., Vol. 1., p. 184, 1913. The name is correctly credited to Lewin as
it was published under his name, but it would be interesting to discover who was the
person who suggested it. It is very probable that it is due to Latham’s assistance,
because all the references are to Latham and some of them could scarcely have been
determined except by reference to Latham himself.
Birds of New South Wales with their Natural History, 4to, Sydney, 1813.
This is the most, interesting Australian bird book yet known, as it appears to be the
first book devoted to Natural History printed and published in Australia. 1 have given
fulldetailsasfarasknownintheEmu, Vol. XV., pp. 33-34,1916, and have nothing to add.
Eighteen plates are included and no Latin names are given, which proves these
were added in London. The plates are. dated 1804 and 1805 and two substitutions
have been affected, plate vnx., figuring Pipia gularis, being omitted and the Crested
Shrike figured instead, the plates being in a different order, so that plate XI.Y. shows
the Warty-face Honey-eater, and upon this plate there are not the additional cuts
of the head and tongue which caused so much confusion. Again, plate xvm. is that
of the Mountain Bee-eater, but this is a different picture and, while the text is on
paper water-marked “ 1809,” the plate is water-marked “ 1811.”
A Natural History of the Birds of New South Wales, 4to, London, 1822.
This was issued after Lewin’s death and twenty-six plates are included, the original
eighteen of the 1808 edition with tlje dates scratched off the plates, no Latin names,
, and in some cases the vernacular names are “ improved.”
The pagination, moreover, agrees with that of the plates, and the additional species
are : Scarlet Creeper, pi. xxx., White-eared Honey-Sucker, pi. xx., Crested Flycatcher,
pi. xxi., White-breasted Honey-Sucker, pi/ xxn., Yellow-breasted Thrush, pi. xxixi.,
Black-crowned Honey-Sucker, pi. xxiv., Common Creeper, pi. xxv., and Crested Shrike,
■ pi. XXVI.
This edition is fairly accessible and is often quoted, but another edition ,
A Natural History of the Birds of New South Wales, collected, engraved and
faithfully painted after Nature. New and improved; Edition, to which is added
a List of the Synonymes of each Species, incorporating the labours of 1' |j. Gould,
N. A. Vigors, T. Horsfield and W. Swainaon. Edited by T. 0. EytSh, folio,
London, 1838,
is the more usual one. ,
This is a poorly coloured edition of the 1822 issue, but the List of Synonymes is
valuable as it contains the name OalamoMrpe australis. \
There is in existence a reprint of this issue which does not even bear any altered
date, simply 1838, but the plates are printed on paper water-marked 1875, and the
colouring is poor and valueless.
