Melbourne, 26th June, 1868.
Mr. G. H. F. Ulrich, of this department, has handed me the
accompanying* excellent illustrated description of the various ore-
dressing processes, and gold extraction machines, used in the
mining district of Schemnitz, Upper Hungary, which he visited
during his recent stay in Europe. The subject of gold extraction
is one?especially as regards the treatment of cur auriferous
pyrites ?that is daily attracting more attention, and is of the
utmost importance, as affecting the future profitable working of
our quartz reefs. Many of the machines and appliances described
by Mr, Ulrich have never been tried in Victoria, but would, doubt-
less, if erected and properly worked, produce as satisfactory results
as they do in Hungary. In any case, I think, they are deserving
of the careful consideration of the very numerous owners of mining
property here, who are now through inefficient machinery daily
losing a very larg*e proportion of the gold raised from their mines.
I would therefore sug*g*est for your approval that Mr. Ulrich s
descriptions should be printed and published, with the accom-
panying illustrations, in the form of a pamphlet. And if the
information given leads, as it should do, to the adoption of more
scientific principles in the treatment of the valuable material
obtained from our quartz reefs, the present great loss of gold
will be prevented, and the average yields of our quartz mines
largely augmented.
I have the honor to be, Sir,
Your most obedient servant,
ALFRED R. C. SELWYN,
The Honorable * Dir. Geo. Survey.
The Minister of Mines,
Victoria.


Geological Survey Offices,
Melbourne, 24th June, 1868,
During my recent journey through Europe I took the oppor-
tunity of visiting the gold-mining district of Schemnitz, Upper
Hungary, for the purpose of inspecting the gold-extraction pro-
cesses and the ore-dressing machinery used there; and I have the
honor to hand you herewith a report, embodying the results of my
observations, accompanied by descriptions and sketches of the
principal machines. I do this in the belief that any information
referring to gold-mining and gold-extraction will be of interest
to our mining community, but more especially so, when it relates
to a country like Hungary, that has long and deservedly been
celebrated for its fine ore-dressing and gold-extraction machinery.
I have to thank the Oberberggraf (Director-General of Mines),
Baron von Medznyansky; Mining Councillor Mr. Franz Foetterle,
Geologist for Hungary; Mining Councillor and Inspector of
Ore-dressing Establishments, Mr. Franz Rauen ; and Assistant
Inspector Schober, for their great kindness, and for affording me
every facility in the inspection of the numerous establishments,
&c.; and I am specially indebted to the two latter gentlemen for
copious notes referring to the machines and mining statistics, that
have greatly aided me in the preparation of this report.
I have the honor to be, Sir,
Your most obedient servant,
GEORGE H. F. ULRICH,
A. R. C. Selwyn, Esq., Field Geologist.
Director of the Geological Survey,
Melbourne.

OBSERVATIONS
ON THE
MODE OF OCCURRENCE AND THE TREATMENT OF
AURIFEROUS, LEAD, AND SILVER ORES. AT SCHEMNITZ,
UPPER HUNGARY.
Of the numerous localities in Hungary, Transylvania, and the
Banat?as, for instance, Schemnitz, Kremnitz, Neusohl, Libethen,
Felsobanya, Kapnik, Nagybanya, Abrudbanya, Offenbanya, Voros-
patak, Oravitza, c�c.?where mining for gold, silver, lead, and
copper has been carried on for a long time past, and is still
prosecuted with tolerably good success ?the first named (Schemnitz),
a royal free mining city of Upper Hungary, is the one, where
at present the most improved and extensive machinery for saving
gold and ore-concentration is in use.
This city lies about 1,700 feet above the level of the sea, along
the foot and principally up the slope of a steep and high range,
forming part of a very mountainous district, representing the
southern spurs of the Carpathians.
The predominant rock of this district is, according to report,
11 trachyte,? and subordinate to this are old plutonic rocks, con-
sisting of syenite, granite, and gneiss, with intermediate belts
of limestone, grey-wacke, and slate. Round Schemnitz itself the
prevailing rock is a dense trachytic diorite-greenstone (Propylite),
passing in places into dioritic porphyry, which, close to the
town, is pierced by a basaltic point of eruption, rising as a fine
conical hill from the centre of a valley. The basalt?a dense
black rock, hardly distinguishable from the older basalts of
Victoria?is now seen only towards the apex of the cone for about
80-100 feet in height: the probably once-existing lava stream
from the hill down the valley having been entirely removed by
denudation. The trachytic diorite-greenstone is, par excellence ,
the metalliferous rock of the district, for in it occur all the lodes
hitherto discovered; and it is an interesting fact that, according
to Beudant?s investigations, it is in appearance, mineralogical
composition and its variations closely allied, if not identical, with


the rocks enclosing- the celebrated rich auriferous and arg-entiferous
mines of South America. The porphjritic variety bears also great
resemblance to the diorite-porphyry dykes of the Wood?s Point
and Raspberry Creek districts of Victoria.
The ore deposits worked at Schemnitz, thoug-h called ? lodes,?
can hardly be termed such, according- to the generally accepted
meaning of the word; for they have neither distinct ? backs ? nor
?footwalls;? and ? casings? or ?gossans? so specially characteristic
of true lodes, are also absent. Their ore-bearing character simply
disappears gradually towards either side; and the greenstone, that
in a decomposed soft state forms the main bulk of the gangue or
veinstone, becomes by degrees harder, and merges at last into the
unaltered rock. There are a great number of such lodes worked
near Schemnitz. Their general strike is N.E. and S.W., and they
may be classified as ? silver lodes proper,? and as ? gold-bearing
galena lodes.? Of the first class the principle ones are the
? Griiner lode,? the ? Stefan lode,? and the ? Biber lode.? These
contain?in a soft veinstone, consisting of a mixture of limestone,
quartz, silicate of alumina (kollyrite) and principally decomposed
greenstone ?finely disseminated, argentiferous pyrites, some ar-
gentiferous galena, and, though formerly very often, now rather
rarely, ?stephanite? (brittle sulphide of silver), ruby silver and
native silver. Native gold is also associated with these ores, but
its quantity is insufiicient to pay special extraction. It is, however,
not lost; as, after the ore has undergone dressing and metallurgical
treatment, it remains with the silver, and is subsequently parted
from it in the mint at Vienna. The amount obtained in this
manner in 1866 was 91| lbs. weight. The second class of lodes?
the auriferous galena lodes?show likewise a veinstone, formed
mainly of decomposed greenstone, associated with quartz, jasper
(locally named ?sinopel?), and sometimes sulphate of baryta.
This veinstone contains principally galena, coarsely disseminated,
and in veins, strings and patches; also iron and copper pyrites,
and zincblende. Fine gold, in nearly microscopic particles, occurs
distributed through the mass of the lode, but in quantities that, in
Victoria, would be considered insignificant?so tons of these ores
having produced in 1866 only 0'421 to 1-140 lb. weight of washed
gold; yet this amount is here sufficiently large to be profitably
extracted by the different saving processes, hereafter to be described.
As regards the special occurrence of the gold, it exists only


disseminated through the decomposed greenstone and the jaspery
quartz, and has recently, in the Spitaler lode, been often found more
concentrated, so to speak, though never visible to the naked eye,
in pale-greenish clayey nodules, called ? milze,? which contain
from 7 dwts. to 1-| oz. per ton. These nodules are carefully saved
and specially submitted to gold extraction. Here, as in Victorian
reefs, galena is a more favorable indication of gold than iron
pyrites, though it does not contain any gold itself; but there is
this peculiar difference, that, whilst the pyrites of our quartz reefs
is generally highly auriferous, it is in the Schemnitz lodes so
poor, that it can safely be left unnoticed.
The two principal lodes, that yield the auriferous so-called
? pocherze? ? i.e. ores that have to be submitted to wet crushing
and concentration processes, and amount to about 29,000 tons per
annum (as average of the last ten years)?are the ? Theresa ? lode
and the ?Spitaler? main lode. The first produces only 3,950 tons
(from the Segengottesstollen mine); the remainder (25,050 tons)
comes from the Spitaler main lode. This is by far the most
important of all the lodes worked. In places it has a workable
thickness of over 50 feet, and an extent in strike of nearly four
miles. Besides the above.ore quantum, taken from the Pacher-
stollen, Sigmundshaft, Andreasshaft, and partly the Maxshaft
mines on its north-eastern extension, it also yields from its south-
western portion 9,000 tons of silver-ores proper, that are taken
from the Ferdinand and the Carlshaft mines. As a whole this
south-western portion shows a thorough change in character: the
free gold decreases so much in amount that it does not pay special
extraction; the galena disappears nearly entirely, and the vein-
stone, previously hard, becomes soft and friable and exactly
resembles in composition and other particulars that of the silver
lodes previously noticed.
Both the silver lodes and auriferous galena lodes have, according
to old mining statistics, in their upper portions and at the surface
been far richer in silver-ores, native silver and gold, than they are
in the present workings, that mostly exceed 200 fathoms in depth.
In those early times the gold also occurred in plainly visible specks
and plates, as shown in old druses and cabinet specimens; and
those portions of the lodes removed by denudation must have been
auriferous somewhat according to Victorian standard, for in the
main valley below the mines there once existed alluvial diggings,


that are said to have been very profitable. A few small parties are
still earning? a scanty livelihood by washing- the sludg-e and banks
of the creek in rude long-torns, connected with blanket-tables.
They use no tin-dish for the final cleaning-, but, instead, the so-called
? scheidetrog? (separating- trough), a kind of instrument very
much resembling a large scoop or the sliding board of a cradle.
It is neatly cut out of a single block of wood, generally sycamore,
18 inches long, 15 inches broad, and with a vertical back
inches high. The sides are likewise vertical and on a level with
the back, whilst the bottom is, for four-fifths of its length off
the back, quite flat, but rises for the other one-fifth towards the
front to the level of the sides. (See Fig. 1.) Great care is
taken to make the bottom quite smooth and even, and it is also
dyed or burnt black by treatment with weak sulphuric acid. To
afford convenience for firmly holding the instrument, the sides
are generally rim-like bent outward 1 inch for about five-eighths
of the length of the trough off the back, and these projections
are furnished with corresponding, half-circular holes (finger holes)
on both sides. By imparting to it a peculiar oscillating, shaking
motion, and striking the back part of the trough after each shake
against the thigh (somewhat after the principle of the percussion-
table), the extremely fine gold is, on addition of a little quick-
silver, easily saved.
The motive-power employed at Schemnitz for both the mining
and ore-dressing machines is, with the exception of several but
recently erected steam-pumping engines at some of the deep shafts,
all water-power, derived from overshot water-wheels. The high
position of the country around Schemnitz is, however, on account
of its dryness by no means favorable for a steady supply of
this element, and nearly two dozen large reservoirs have been
constructed in different valleys, connected with drains of some
40,000 fathoms in length. These reservoirs have a joint total
capacity of 216 millions cubic feet, but they are only in rare
cases filled to about two-thirds of that amount. Less is, however,
insufficient for driving the water-wheels of both the mining and
ore-dressing machinery all the year through ; consequently, as
the safety of the mines demands the constant working of the
former, it happens, that the whole of the latter can rarely be
kept in full working order for more than seven to eight months.
This great drawback, especially during the last ten years, has


greatly affected the prosperity of the district; but it is now con-
templated, to meet it by the erection of more steam-engines.
Having thus given an outline of the mining features, the
character of the lodes and other particulars, which may he of
interest, I will now proceed, to describe the various manipulations
and processes, to which the auriferous lead-ore, ? pocherz ,? is
subjected, both for concentrating the galena and saving the free
gold?operations, which go hand in hand.
The silver-ores, it must be mentioned, are likewise mostly of
such character, that they have to be treated in a similar manner,
with the exception that they do not pass the gold-saving machines.
The first operation is?
THE ROUGH SORTING- OF THE ORE.
Directly the ore is raised from the mines, it is transported in
trucks to specially prepared level places, ?dressing-floors,? lying
a few feet lower than the tramway, and is there by emptying the
trucks over screens divided into coarse pieces and fine matter,
called ? waschgiinge.? The former are broken, or spalled, by
lads with suitable hammers into pieces of 2 cubic inches in
size, special care being taken to knock as much veinstone off as
possible; these pieces are placed in three heaps, viz:?one of
pure ore, if any, which is reserved for direct metallurgical
treatment; one of coarsely impregnated ore; and the third
of finely impregnated ditto, which, as also the fine stuff fallen
through the screen, are submitted to different dressing processes.
During the spalling special attention is also paid to the separation
of the auriferous clayey nodules, ? milze ,? of which mention has
been made previously. The whole of this work is performed by
contract under the supervision of an overseer, and is paid for
according to the hardness of the ore at the rate of 15-18
kreutzer? i.e. 3fd. to 4<|d. ?per box of 10 cubic feet; the saving
of the nodules is specially rewarded at a certain rate, calculated
on their richness in gold.
TREATMENT OF THE WASCHGANGE
(SCREENED ORE).
Of this kind of ore only that, obtained from the Pacherstollen
and Sigmundshaft mines, on the Spitaler lode, amounting to from
60-60 tons per annum on the average, undergoes, on account of


its clayey character, the following- preparatory treatment:?lt is
cleaned in the so-called
11 Wasch-trommel ?
(washing-drum), a hollow truncated cone, 12-15 feet in length,
and 3-4 feet in diameter at one, 5-6 feet at the other end,
constructed of strong oak planks, tightly drawn together hy
several iron rings. This apparatus rests horizontally, and revolves
at the rate of about 8-10 times per minute on an iron axle,
that runs lengthways through its centre and is fastened to its
inner surface by means of radial iron spokes.
Both ends are partly closed by rims of boards: The smaller
one receives the clayey ore matter continuously from a funnel-
shaped self-feeding hopper, and a pipe supplies at the same time a
constant stream of water of 2-4 cubic feet per minute, by means
of which, assisted by the constant sliding of the stuff, incidental
upon the revolving of the drum, the ore is effectually cleaned
during its gradual progress towards the wider end of the cone.
It emerges from here steadily upon a classifier, the so-called
? Springrtitter
a strong wooden frame, enclosing, one above the other, four
alternately reversely inclined sieves, moving between guides,
and connected at the top by a chain with a spring-lever.
This apparatus is drawn downward (1-2 inches) and released
again in quick succession, and receives thereby percussion strokes
upwards against a bar, on which it abuts when at rest. The four
sieves, from the upper one downward, have meshes respectively
2? htV square, and the cleaned ore is, therefore, through
the action of this machine, classified into five different sizes. Four
roll from the sieves into special compartments or bins, and the
fifth, that passes through the lowest sieve and consists of fine
sand and slime, is conducted by a launder into settling pits. In
close proximity to this classifier there are several long tables, on
which boys sort the coarsest portion of the ore?viz. that from the
compartment of the upper sieve?into pure ore, coarsely impreg-
nated ore, and waste; and the same is done with the other three
sorts by means of three different hydraulic jigging machines, each
supplied with sieves suitable, as regards size of meshes, to the stuff
of one of the bins. Of the three classes of ore thus obtained (the
waste being, of course, thrown away), the pure ore goes to the


smelting works, and the other two, as will be seen hereafter,
undergo the same treatment as the large masses of ore of similar
quality above referred to.
We will now follow the working of the fine sand and slimes,
accumulating in the settling-pits.
This stuff is conveyed to common tyes, in which the fine ore is
concentrated in the usual manner, the work being performed by
strong lads, three generally attending a set of three tyes. This
ore, composed principally of galena and some pyrites, contains,
disseminated, free gold, which is separated by a peculiar washing
process, the description of which will he given further on, when
speaking specially of gold extraction.
TREATMENT OE THE COARSELY IMPREGNATED
ORE.
The quantity of this class of ore obtained per annum is, like
that of the former one, rather Small, amounting to onty 50-60
tons, and comes mostly from the same mines. The first operation,
it undergoes, is crushing between two horizontal iron rollers, each
18 inches in diameter and 16 inches in length, which revolve
against each other at the rate of 30-40 revolutions per minute.
This crushing mill requires three horse-power to work it. It
pulverizes about | of a ton per hour, and is, therefore, only 2-3 days
per annum in operation. The crushed ore falls from between the
rollers into the top portion of a sizing machine, the
? Prellratter,?
containing four different sieves with holes respectively 6, 4,
and 1J lines square, which acts on a similar principle to the
classifier previously described. There is, however, this difference
in the construction : the four sieves are fixed close to each other
lengthways and steplike? i.e. one about f inch lower than the
other?in a strong rectangular wooden frame, suspended between
guides, at an inclination of 18�, and the smaller sieves lie at the
upper end. The front of the frame is fixed to a strong spring,
which presses it against a stout bar, and it receives the percussion
strokes (about 200 per minute) on being moved backward and
suddenly released again.
The crushed stuff is thereby classified into four different sizes,
which fall into bins beneath the machine. The coarsest ?that
which falls through the sieve at the lower end of the apparatus ?


is once more brought between the rollers, whilst the two kinds next
in size are separately treated on a new machine, called, after the
inventor,
? Hit finger's Continuously-acting Jigging-taller
Of this machine, which is rather complicated in its construction,
I am only able to give the main features, having had no opportu-
nity to examine its details closely. Its working - principle is that of
the hydraulic jigging machine, combined with the simultaneous or
concurrent discharge into separate compartments, without manual
labor, of the different classes of material, which the action of the
machine arranges on the sieve according to their respective
densities. It consists of a rectangular box O, Fig l- 2), constructed
of strong planks, well secured with iron angle braces and firmly
fixed to the floor. This box is about 3 feet high, 18 inches wide,
and 3 feet 0 inches long at the bottom inside, but expands at one
end?which we will call the front?to about 4 feet 6 inches at the
top, this end shelving outwards from about 1 foot off the bottom.
Moving up and down in this box, about 10-12 inches from the top,
between the vertical back of the box and a stout partition board
(5), is a piston formed of a cast-iron frame, 3 feet long and 18
inches broad, that carries on top, fixed to a rim and cross-pieces
of boards, four stout leather valves, movable upwards, whilst from
the centres of its long sides rise two round iron bars (c) vertically
for about 2 feet, where they are screwed to a wooden cross-piece
( d ). The centre of this latter is joined vertically above the centre
of the piston, by means of an iron connecting rod (e), to an eccen-
tric, attached to the end of an iron axle. This axle rests in proper
bearings and is supplied with a small fly-wheel. It receives its
revolving motion (which imparts the up and down motion to the
piston) by means of straps and pulleys from the axle of the water-
wheel. Close over the top of the box, lengthways between the
piston uprights, hangs, horizontally suspended by four thin iron
rods {ffff ), a strong rectangular wooden frame (y), 15 inches
wide inside and 6| feet long, which, in its normal position, rests
slightly with one end upon the vertical back of the box, whilst the
other projects beyond the shelving front end of the latter, where
the inside of its stout front board is attached to a strong spring ( h ),
which presses it against a wooden crossbar (i). The jigging-sieve
(7d) is inserted, horizontally in transverse direction, in the back part
of this frame and near its lower rim, above the piston, and stretches


to about 1 inch beyond the shelving end of the box. It is quite
level as far as the piston extends, hut has there, in a line with the
partition board (b), a bend of near 2 inches downward, and the
remainder, above the widening part of the box, lies thus at a lower
level and is slightly inclined forward. Above the latter portion of
the sieve there are two perforated, thin sheet-iron plates, called the
dividers (I w). These are inserted in the frame, transversely hori-
zontal, at different heights?varying between 1-2 and l|-3 inches,
and can be adjusted by means of screws (n n ). The lower plate (I)
commences about 1 inch beyond, and parallel to, the line of bend in
the sieve, and extends about foot farther than the latter. It has
also, about 5-6 inches from its commencing edge, a small bend of
|-1 inch downward, and the remainder is slightly inclined forward.
The sharp horizontal edge of the second divider ( m ) lies about |
inch beyond, and in a line with, the bend of the first one; and the
plate, which is quite even, but, like the lower one, slightly inclined,
overlaps 1 foot the end of the sieve. Both terminating edges of the
dividers ( Im) lie exactly over and above the openings to two com-
partments {op), which are formed by planks underneath, and adjoin
a third one {q) beneath the end of the jigging-sieve {h). The
box is constantly kept full of water by means of a pipe, emptying
through one of the sides, between the piston and the sieve, and the
orey matter is introduced on the back part of the latter (and
generally kept 3-4 inches thick all over its level portion?for fine
grains thinner than for coarser ones) by means of a funnel-shaped
self-feeding hopper (r), which is fixed outside the box, but is
connected by a spring with the narrow backboard of the sieve-
frame (jigging-table). On examining the effects of the motion of
the piston it is clear, that at every up-stroke it presses the water
through the sieve; the material on the latter is thereby lifted, and,
dropping during* the downward motion of the piston, arranges
itself, whilst settling, according to its specific gravity; and at the
same time the water falls and is partly sucked back through the
sieve at the place, where the box widens out. Simultaneously with
the downward motion of the piston a tooth in the circumference of
the eccentric acts upon the claw of the vertical arm of a lever ( s ),
the lower end of which is joined to a horizontal rod (t), that is fixed
at the other end, by means of screws, to the spring ( k ), attached
to the front board of the sieve-frame; the spring being thereby
bent backwards, the sieve-table is moved backwards also, but, on


the tooth suddenly releasing' its hold, it strikes forward against the
bumping-bar ; and the arrangement is such, that this stroke ensues,
when the piston has completed seven-eig'hts of its downward motion.
On account of this percussion the classified stuff on the sieve, being
shoved forward, is cut into by the sharp edg'es of the perforated
iron plates the dividers (Z vi) ?which are adjusted in position
according to the quality of the stuff. It is thus divided into three
portions, different in richness, slides at each stroke more forward,
and falls ultimately from the plates into the respective compart-
ments (op q) provided underneath, one portion from the sieve, the
other two from the plates. The percussion, however, has also the
further effect, that by means of the spring connection of the back part
of the sieve-table with the feeding-hopper an adjustable fresh portion
of material is introduced upon the sieve at every stroke, and thus
uninterrupted action is procured. In order to steady the motion of
the jigging-table, and prevent its being lifted by the water during
the up-stroke of the piston, a rim of boards as high as the frame is
fixed upon the edges of the sides and round a projection of the
back end of the box, and upon the top of this rim narrow strips
of stiff sheet-iron are nailed, that project partly over the sieve-frame.
Provision is also made against the outsplashing' of water from
between the sieve-frame and the box by means of leather strips,
nailed inside the latter ; these overlap the joint, when the water is
pressed upward. Two pipes (u u), of about \ inch in diameter,
are inserted at different places near the bottom of the box through
one of the sides; these afford escape for any fine sands and slimes,
falling through the sieve, into an adjoining sunk cistern. The first
ore compartment (y) is provided with a gutter in the floor to con-
duct the water off, that is pressed over the front of the box. The
length of stroke of both the piston and jigging-table are adjust-'
able by means of screws; that of the former varies between
inches, that of the latter between \ inch, and the number of
percussions equal to the strokes of the piston? amount to from
50-60 per minute, finer material wanting less stroke, but in quicker
succession. This machine requires, according to calculation, about
hoise-power to work it, a supply of cubic feet of water per
minute, whilst one workman is sufficient for its attendance. At
Schemnitz it is considered, for coarser grains, one of the most
perfect concentration machines hitherto invented, both as regards
qualitative and quantitative results ; its working effect, as com-


pared to that of the common hydraulic and hand jigging machines,
standing, for instance, in the proportion of 3 2 * 1, whilst it
classifies the ore just as perfectly, as these machines do. Sufficient
supply of water (indicated by no air-bubbles rising through the ore
on the sieve), very careful and exact adjustment of all its parts,
and especially a steady and regular motion of the machine are,
however, necessary conditions for its satisfactory working.
Returning now to the two sizes of ore to be submitted to the
action of this machine: they contain, according to experiment,
200-300 lbs. of lead and 0-007 ozs. of gold per ton, and are
classified by once or twice passing over the sieve, according to
judgment, into three sorts, viz.: ?
Ore containing 900 lbs. of lead and 0-04 oz. of gold per ton.
Ditto 200 lbs. ditto 0-14 oz. ditto
Ditto 60 lbs. ditto 0-24 oz. ditto
The first of these sorts goes to the smelting works ; the other two
undergo for the extraction of the gold and further concentration of
the ore the same operations as the large masses of finely impreg-
nated ore, a description of which will follow presently. On
.examining the results of the. jigging operation, touching the rela-
tive proportion of the gold to the galena in the three kinds of ore,
it becomes apparent, that the gold does not increase in the same
proportion as the galena, a fact affording a striking proof, that the
former is not disseminated or impregnated through the latter, but
exists, finely divided, through the gangue ?quartz, jasper, and
decomposed gi'eenstone.
We have now still to follow the treatment of the fine grains
separated by, and the fine orey matter going through, the finest
sieve of the sizing machine, attached to the crushing-mill. The
former are treated by a hand jigging machine, the latter is
submitted to the action of a centrifugal sorting apparatus, by
means of which the coarser grains are separated from the fine
sands and slimes. The construction of this apparatus is very
simple. It consists of a cylindrical wooden cistern, that contracts
to an open funnel at the lower end, and contains within this
funnel-shaped part a smaller funnel of sheet-iron, the outlet pipe
of which goes through that of the larger one. The water, carrying
the stuff, is introduced into the top part of the cylinder, the outlets
being kept closed, till it is nearly full, when, on their being opened,
a rotating motion of the fluid immediately sets in, and, the centri-


fugal power acting- upon the larg-e grains more than upon the
smaller ones, they are thrown against the inner walls of the cylinder,
and pass out between its funnel-shaped part and the inner sheet-
iron funnel, whilst the finer sand and slime escape through the
latter. The grains, thus received, are concentrated in the usual
manner by a hand jigging machine, whilst the fine material is
conducted by a launder to machines, and undergoes operations,
that form an important feature in the treatment of the finely
impregnated ore, to a description of which we have now to proceed.
TREATMENT OE THE FINELY IMPREGNATED OEE.
This occupies by far the most important position amongst the
ore-dressing operations at Schemnitz. The total quantity of ore
coming under this head amounts to 62,400 tons per annum, 29,000
tons of which consist of auriferous lead ores, that are, as already
mentioned,,submitted to gold extraction in addition to concentra-
tion ; whilst the remainder (33,400 tons), being non-auriferous
silver ores, undergo the latter process only. The different main
operations, the auriferous ore is submitted to in regular, sequence,
are the following : ? l. Wet Stamping. 2. Principal Gold-saving
Process. 8. Classification of the Sands and Slimes. 4. Concen-
tration of the Classified Portions. 5. Extraction of Gold from,
the Concentrated Orey Matter.
I.? Stamping.
This is performed by a number of stamping-mills, driven by
water-wheels, and distributed, one below the other, in several
valleys? i.e. in such positions, that the water of the upper mill in
each valley can easily be made use of by the others in succession.
The different mills contain from nine up to thirty-six stampers ;
three, and in some rare cases five, being arranged in a battery. Both
the cara-harrel and the shanks of the stampers consist, as usual on
the Continent, of hard wood. The former is from 18-20 inches in
diameter, and furnished with wooden, and in some mills with iron
cams. The shanks are each 12-14 feet long, from 6-6 inches
square, and have, about the middle of their length, wooden lifters
or tappets, movable in slots, for the purpose of equalizing the lift
in proportion as the stamper-heads are worn off. These latter
(Fig. 3) consist of hard white cast-iron, are 9 inches high, and,
like the shanks, 6-6 inches square, to which they are fixed by


means of plate-like tongues (a), 6 inches long, 5 inches broad, and
2 inches thick, that are cast in one piece with the stamp-head (J).
These tongues are inserted into the wood, and tightly fixed by two
or three strong iron rings (c), firmly wedged over the ends of the
shanks ( d ). A stamper-head of 5 inches square weighs about
90 lbs.; one of 6 inches square, 112 lbs. With the respective
shanks attached, the whole weight of a stamper with the light head
amounts to between 180-200 lbs., and one with the heavy head to
280-300 lbs., and each strikes from fifty to sixty blows per minute,
with a lift varying from B?lo inches. A battery of three heads
is supplied with 09-1-2 cubic feet of water. Some experiments
have been made to determine the relative working effects of heavy
and light stampers under otherwise equal conditions?*.#. same
kind of stuff, 9 inches lift, fifty to sixty blows per minute &c.?, and
it has been found, that the heavy stamper needs 0-615 horse-power
to work it, and crushes from 800-1,100 lbs. of stuff in twenty-
four hours; whilst the light one requires 0A62 horse-power and
pulverizes about 550 lbs. in the same time. These results are
greatly in favor of the former, and more especially so, as it has
been proved, that the larger quantity of stuff can pass over the
gold-saving machines in the same time, without affecting their
efficiency. The coffer, or stamper-box, is constructed of thick
planks, firmly joined together and secured with iron braces. As
regards the mode of discharge of the pulverized material and the
nature of the bottom, there are two different systems in use?one
being of recent invention. Those battery boxes, constructed after
the old system, called the
? Schubersatz ?
(Fig, 4), have a stone or concrete bottom (�), formed by firmly rig
ramming into a strong wooden box ( h ), sunk into the ground,
successive layers of quartz, mixed with some hard greenstone;
and the discharge of the crushed matter takes place at the sides
opposite the feeding-hopper through a slot ( c ), |-1 inch broad,
running about 2 inches above the bottom along the wdiole length
of the box. The-portion of the box above this slot, though during
working firmly fixed by wedges, is movable between guiding
boards, and affords thus easy access to the inside of the battery;
hence its name, ? schuber" ? i.e. sliding-board or sliding-apron ( d ).
To the outside of the lower portion of the box, rising from beneath
the slo� (c), there is a strong board ( e ) closely fixed at such a


distance from the sliding-board, that a vertical channel {J) of �-1
inch in width is formed, up which the crushed material has to rise
before finally escaping. The height of this channel?or, what is
generally taken as measure, the height of the upper edge of this
board above the bottom of the battery?determines the fineness of
size to which the material is stamped,? i.e. the higher the hoard,
the finer, and vice versa; whilst, at the same time, an increase or
decrease of the water supply affords an easy means of producing
respectively coarser or finer grain with the same height of outlet.
This mode of discharge was, Sfter many years? trial, adopted as
the one, that, besides a considerable saving on account of sieves,
procured the quick and undisturbed escape of the crushed particles,
and especially as being the most applicable for fine stamping. The
effective extraction of the gold from the ores under notice requires
the size of the crushed particles to be not larger than just to
permit their passage through holes of OG millimetre in diameter ;
and in order to ensure this, the outlet edge is 12-13 inches above
the bottom of the battery, and the supply of water OS-OA cubic
feet per minute.
The second kind of battery box, called, after its inventor,
? Hittinger\s Stausatz ?
(Figs. 5 and 6), has a strong cast-iron plate bottom (a), that is
firmly wedged into the box, and the interstices all round closed by
strips of board. The side opposite that, where the stampers are
fed, about l|-3 inches above the bottom, is supplied with a sieve
(b), furnished with holes of such size, as only to permit the passage
of material of the required fineness. Along the front of this sieve,
at a distance of 1-2 inches, and rising several inches above it, a
water-tight apron (c), composed of strong boards, is fixed to the
box in such a manner, that a vertical open slit (d) is formed similar
to that of the other battery box ; but with this difference, that it
extends several inches beneath the level of the bottom of the
battery, and has an outlet pipe ( e ) in the centre of its lower edg?e.
The bottom of the channel is made to incline from both sides to-
wards this outlet by means of boards, inserted in the angles. The
amount of discharge through the pipe can be regulated, and it is
fixed so that the water rises and is kept at such a level above the
stamper-heads in the battery box, that their play takes place
entirely under water. According to present experience, this kind of


stamper box will most likely supersede the old one entirely, for
though it entails some expense for sieves and some trouble, as
regards their exchange, in case coarser or finer stamping is to be
resorted to, still its working effect is so great, as to outweigh all these
disadvantages, surpassing that of the old box by nearly 50 per cent.
The feeding of the stampers is in some establishments effected
by self-feeding hoppers, in others by manual labor; the batteries
having?, in the latter case, a small hopper attached, into which the
stuff is thrown with shovels.
On issuing from the batteries, the crushed material falls into a
launder, which conducts it to a main trough, supplying the
machines used for?
2.?The Principal Gold-saying Process.
This process effects the extraction of the gold direct from the
crushed material to an amount forming 70 to 76 per cent, of
the yearly produce of that metal by all washing operations. The
amalgamaters used for this purpose, the working of which goes
on concurrently with that of the stampers, are the so-called
? Hungarian or ?Tyrolese Gold-mills .?
Two of these have, by experience, been found sufficient for the
treatment of the crushed material from each battery of three
stampers. They are erected conveniently near the latter, and
arranged, with 3-4 inches space between each other, in such a
manner that, supposing the stamping-mill to consist of four
batteries, they form two parallel rows of four each, with the
front row at a level 5 inches lower, in order to allow the crushed
stuff to pass easily from the mills of the upper row to those
of the lower one. Each mill of the upper row receives its supply
from the main launder, and discharges, by means of a small
tin spout, into the mill straight in front of it in the lower row.
Although known in Victoria, and in use at several goldfields
years ago, a description of these mills and of their action may not
be out of place here, more especially as during latter years
changes have been effected both in the details of their construc-
tion and in the mode of working them.
An apparatus of'this kind is composed of three main parts,
namely:? l. The basin or howl ; 2. The runner , which revolves
inside the basin by means of a vertical iron axle?the spindle?
fixed centrically to it; and 3. The arrangement for transmission


of motive-power from the axle of the water-wheel to the spindle
of the mill.
The basin (a, Fig. 7) consists of cast-iron, |-inch thick, 6J
inches high, 24 inches diameter at top and 18 inches at the flat
bottom inside. An iron cylinder or pipe ( b ), which rises for 4-5
inches, is cast to the centr of the basin. This pipe has 3 inches
outer, and 1| inch inner diameter, and serves for the reception of
the lower pivot bearings (c) of the spindle ( d ). These hearings
(c) consist generally of iron, and are protected against the influx
of sand &c. by a mantle or hood of sheet-iron ( e ). About 3| inches
above the bottom there is a hole, 4 inches broad, in the rim of the
basin, to which a tin or sheet-iron outlet {/) is rivetted. The
fixing of the basin to the planks of the floor is effected in a simple
manner, either by screws through two ears, cast opposite to each
other on to its bottom, or the latter is cast with a projecting rim,
over which iron claws or hooks are driven into the floor.
The runner ( g ) is constructed of pine wood, of the exact
shape of the inside of the basin, hut of somewhat smaller size,
and is furnished at top with a wide funnel-shaped cavity, which
communicates with a cylindrical hole of 5 inches diameter through
the centre. Its size and shape are such that, when suspended
centrically in its proper position in the basin?the hole just men-
tioned allowing it to go freely over the cylinder above described?,
its surface is parallel to the inner surface of the basin, and
leaves an open space, | inch broad round the side, and inch at
the bottom, and it projects about I inch above the top of the basin.
Two thin sheet-iron hoops round the circumference protect it against
cracking, and its bottom is armed with about twenty blades or knife-
like scrapers ( h , Fig. 8) of sheet-iron, | inch thick and 2\ inches
long, which are radially driven into the wood, each projecting
exactly | inch. The centrical connection of the runner with the
spindle is in some cases effected after the old method, by means of
a tripod ; hut this will be gradually superseded by the generally
applied and more practical new arrangement of a wrought-iron
fork (i) with two prongs, which are driven through the runner and
screwed tight, whilst a square collar (k ), formed at their junction, is
slid over a square portion (Z) of the spindle; 6-7 inches below this
part, the prongs are connected by an iron cross-bar (w), which fits
with a flat, round collar over the spindle, where the latter has, for
several inches, screw turnings. Two nuts (nn), one above, the


other below the collar, serve both for fixing the runner and to
adjust it ? i.e. to raise or lower it according to requirement. Each
spindle has, a few inches above the upper collar, a coupling
(o, Fig. 9), for the purpose of throwing the runner out of action,
without interfering with those of the other mills.
For the transmission of motive-power from the axle of the Fig,
water-wheel to the set of mills, attached to a stamping machine,
three different methods are in use, viz., by endless straps and
pulleys, by cranks and by mitre-wheels. The latter arrangement
is the one most approved, and will therefore gradually replace the
others; for it insures not only a better and more undisturbed
working of the mills, but, though more expensive in the first
instance, is ultimately cheaper as regards wear and tear. The
construction is as follows: The pivot at the upper extremity of
each spindle (Fig. 9), turning in a collar of white beechwood ( p ),
inserted in the horizontal beam of the framing, carries, at its end
that projects a few inches above the beam, a small horizontal
mitre-wheel ( q ), 6 inches in diameter, with 21 teeth ; this wheel is
turned smooth on its lower side, which rests upon an equally
smooth iron plate, let into and secured by screws to the beam.
Sometimes, as in Fig. 9, the end of the spindle is enlarged, and
the rim rests upon the iron plate. All the mitre-wheels of the
mills standing in one row are now connected with corresponding
vertical ones (r) of the same size, wedged over a horizontal iron
axle that runs above the beam the whole length of the row of
mills, and turns in white beechwood bearings at the points of
support. According to the position of the two rows of mills, with
reference to the axle of the water-wheel (for instance, whether
parallel or at right angles to it), mitre-wheels, the same size as
those on the spindles, are fixed either at one end or on some part
of the length of the horizontal axles. These are simultaneously
turned, at the same time moving the runners of all the mills, by
two other mitre-wheels, 10 inches in diameter, with 35 teeth,
that are fixed on an iron axle, connected with the axle of the
water-wheel, either direct or by intermediate gearing. The relative
diameters and numbers of teeth of the large and small mitre-
wheels, viz., 10 : 6-and 35 : 21, are so calculated that if the
water-wheel goes at its fullest suitable speed? i.e. at 16 revolutions
per minute?the runners of the mills revolve 26 times during
the same period. Their general speed is, however, only 16-20


revolutions per minute, and the motive-power required for one
mill is but o?o4 horse-power, or 25 mills can be turned by one
full horse-power. When the runners of a set of mills are properly
arranged, so that they revolve exactly vertical and centrical in the
basins, each of the latter receives 60 lbs. of quicksilver (the mills
of some establishments receive only 30 lbs., the reason for which
will be given further on), which forms a ring*, 7 inches wide and
i inch thick, at the bottom, round the central pipe; and then a
most important adjustment has to be made, namely, that of
raising or lowering each runner, so that the lower edges of the
iron blades, projecting from its bottom, stand just line above
the level of the quicksilver. This distance, together with the
breadth of the blades inch, as above given), has, by experience,
been ascertained to insure the greatest saving of gold and
smallest loss of mercury. If once in proper working order, a
set of mills requires afterwards hut little supervision. Small
tin gutters, attached to the main launder, distribute, as already
mentioned, the crushed material equally to the mills, forming? the
first or upper row, and introduce it into the large funnel-shaped
cavity of the runners, where it descends through the open space
round the central pipe, and comes in contact with the quicksilver.
It then undergoes much whirling about through the action of the
iron blades?which, while promoting contact with the quicksilver,
prevents deposition??, and gradually rising in the annular space
between the runner and the inner wall of the basin, it passes out
through the outlet spout into the mill straight in front, where the
same process is repeated. The crushed material which passes a
gold-mill in this manner from a battery of three heavy stampers,
amounts in the average, per second, to o?ol6 cubic feet, containing
oz. of sand and slimes. On account of the ores being
very poor in gold, and in order not to lose unnecessary time and
money by too frequent interruptions of the process, the mills are
allowed to run for four weeks at a stretch; the runners are then
lifted out of the basins, and the whole of the mercury is removed.
During this work, which generally lasts several hours, any small
defects of the machinery are repaired, and all the different parts
properly looked after. The amalgam is pressed through specially
constructed double filters of chamois leather or strong close canvas,
and the filtered portion, that still contains about | oz. of gold
per cwt,, is returned to the mills, which are then set in action


again. The mills of the lower rows are generally supplied with
distilled quicksilver, for reasons which will be explained further on.
The rather soft amalgam, obtained in the filters, is repeatedly pressed
through close canvas, with hot water, till it becomes quite hard,
when it is formed into balls of 3|-4 ozs. in weight, which are
labelled and reserved for distillation. This amalgam contains
about 25-33 per cent, of gold, and the relative quantities received
from the upper and lower rows of mills are, on the average, in the
proportion of 64'5 per cent. ; 35'5 per cent.
When the mills at the end of a working period are opened, the
greater part of the amalgam is always found collected round the
central pipes of the basins. This fact led to the experiment of
using smaller basins, in which the ring of quicksilver, instead of
7 inches, was only 3 inches broad, reducing the quantity of quick-
silver to be used from 50 lbs. to 26-28 lbs. If this experiment
had been generally successful, it would not only have lessened the
outlay for quicksilver considerably, but would also in a great mea-
sure have reduced the loss of that metal ; it was, however, found
that from ores rich in galena ?and they form by far the greater
portion to be treated ?the produce of gold was 20?25 per cent, less
than formerly. Only the ores of one mine?the Max shaft, on the
Spi taler lode?which are comparatively poor in galena, yielded the
same quantity of gold, whilst the loss of mercury was 60 per cent,
less than previously, and they are therefore the only ones treated
in small basins, supplied with 30 lbs. of quicksilver only (see above).
The average loss of quicksilver sustained by the mill process is
stated to be 20 ozs. for 50 tons of ore, rich in galena, and only
ozs. for the same quantity of ore from the mine just men-
tioned. It is in reality, however, nearly 20 per cent, greater, for
this amount is recovered during subsequent operations.
Another fact, experimentally discovered, touching the quick-
silver and its use, as applied to the mill process, deserves mention:
It is, that pure distilled quicksilver seizes upon gold eagerly up to
a certain point ?the limit of saturation ?which is f oz. per 6 tons;
beyond that point, when pasty amalgam commences to form, its
action upon the gold is far less energetic. Taking advantage of
this fact, by supplying the mills of both the upper and lower rows
with pure quicksilver, and leaving it only in action, till it had
acquired the above limit of saturation, the yield of gold augmented
20 per cent., which, taking into account the smaller amount


extracted by the subsequent, operations, represented still 6-44 per
cent, increase on the total produce of gold. This profit, considerable
as it appears, was, however, much lessened by the expense and loss
incident upon the repeated distilling 1 of the mercury, its transport,
and the more frequent interruptions of the process?the mills of the
upper rows, for instance, having 1 to be cleared every five to six days.
This caused a less yearly produce, with a g'reater amount of manual
labor, and therefore this method of amalgamation has been discon-
tinued as far as reg'ards the mills of the upper rows, but is still in
operation for those of the lower ones, because the stuff travelling
through them is so much poorer in gold that the limit of saturation
of the quicksilver is only reached after every twenty-eight to thirty
days, when the mills of the upper rows have to be cleared also.
Having thus given an insight into the construction and working-
of the Hungarian mills, it remains to show the further treatment
of the crushed material.
On leaving the mills of the lower rows, the stuff falls into a
narrow trough, from which it is, by means of wooden shutters,
equally distributed over a number of
Inclined Tables or Strahes,
which are representative of our blanket-strakes: they differ from
them, however, in not being made in steps but even throughout,
and that the covering medium does not consist of baize or blanket-
cloth, but of a very rough kind of canvas, resembling 1 sackcloth,
which is specially prepared for the purpose. Their length and
breadth vary in the different establishments between 6-12 feet and
13?1 <S inches respectively, with an inclination of I?Ji inch per
foot, and they are constructed by preparing an even flooring 1 of
boards, laid crossways, of the required size and inclination. This is
divided into equal divisions by longitudinal partitions, 2-3 inches
broad and 2 inches high, with cheeks of similar dimensions fixed
along the sides. The number of strakes constructed in connection
with a certain number of mills is generally in the relation of 6-f-8,
with one table extra. Thus eight mills have seven tables, six of
which are in action at a time, whilst the seventh is opened, when
one of the six is closed for the purpose of washing the canvas
pieces. These pieces are generally cut of such size that two, for
instance, cover a table 6 feet in length, including 1 , of course, the
overlap. Numerous experiments have proved this coarse canvas


to be more advantageous, partly as regards cheapness, partly in
action, than blanket-cloth, or than two other peculiar methods
of producing the required rough surface, viz., by scratching the
boards, or substituting for the latter finely corrugated iron plates.
The wear and tear of the cloth, which is prepared of a width to
suit that of the tables, is about 16 feet for working 50 tons of sands
and slimes ?the pieces lasting generally from six to eight weeks.
They are washed in tanks in the same manner as the blanket pieces
used in Victoria. The operation is performed by boys every one to
three hours, according as the supply of crushed material from the
stampers is larger or smaller, one boy being generally sufficient for
working from ten to fifteen tables. The stuff, in this manner
collected in the tanks, forms from 2 to 3 per cent, of the whole
amount of ore crushed, and consists of finely divided galena, pyrites
and gangue, distributed through which is fine free gold and small
globules of mercury, escaped from the mills. Its treatment is the
same as that of the concentrated ore slimes, to be given further
on. After passing the strakes the crushed material undergoes?
3. ?Classification according to Size of Grain.
This operation is effected in three different ways, viz., either
in slime labyrinths, or 'pyramidal boxes ( u Spitzhdsten ), or
triangular double troughs ( u Spitzlutten?).
The Labyrinths
consist of a number of contiguous, connected settling pits which,
if, for instance, in connection with three batteries of three light
stampers, increase in size from l-11-lg-lf foot square in transverse
section, and respectively from 15-21-24-36 feet in length, with
inclinations in the same sequence of |-|-g inch per foot, the largest
being horizontal. Such a labyrinth classifies the stuff in four
portions, different in size of grain, that form deposits during its
passage from the smaller to the larger pits, the coarser grains
depositing of course in the former. This classification is, however,
far from perfect, and is besides attended with expenses on account
of transport and re-puddling of the settled stuff, previous to further
treatment. It also entails a large loss through escape and waste of
fine material, that generally amounts to 10-12 per cent., but may,
in unfavorable cases,' rise to 15-20 per cent. The labyrinths are
therefore now in operation only in some of the older and smaller
establishments, where want of space or other circumstances prevent
the use of either of the other two classifying apparatus, which,
as far as experience goes, satisfy all requirements.


The Pyramidal Boxes (? Spitzkdsten ?),
? (^e s> 10,11, and 12), as their name implies, are hollow, generally
rectangular, pyramids. They are constructed of strong boards,
well joined together (strong' sheet-iron may be employed also).
The sides are inclined at angles not less than 50�, and there is a
small hole in one side close to the apex. They are fixed horizon-
tally, in an inverted position, and the crushed material is introduced
at one of the narrow sides, a few inches below the top, by means of
a launder. The result is that, as soon as the box is filled, a certain
portion of the crushed matter ? i.e. the coarsest and heaviest, which
the water, on account of its diminished velocity, is not able to carry
further?sinks and slides down the inclined sides of the pyramid,
and escapes through the small hole (a) near the apex, whilst the finer
and lighter matter passes off at the top by an outlet (b) in the centre
of the side, opposite to the point of entrance. If now a second larger
box be attached to the first, a third, still larger one, to the second,
and so on?each succeeding box at a slightly lower level, in order to
prevent any settlement of stuff in the passage ways?it follows not
only, that the same process of settling and escaping of the particles
from the apex will take place in every box, but also, that their size
will decrease nearly in inverse proportion, as the surface of a
succeeding box is larger than that of the preceding one, or directly
as the velocity of the water is diminished in it. According to this
principle of the boxes?if they were made of only very gradually
increasing size, and the apex holes proportionately small?it would
be possible, to classify the stuff into a great number of portions,
different in size of grain, before it has entirely settled?i.e. till clear
water passes off from the last box. Experience has, however,
shown, that for fine ore-dressing, in general, classification into four
different sizes by an apparatus of four boxes is quite sufficient.
The size of the different boxes, in order to insure the most perfect
classification, depends both on the amount of material, which has
to pass through them per second, and the size and character of the
grains ; and by theory and practice it has been found, that for the
supply of every cubic foot of material the width of the first or
smallest box must be foot? i.e., for instance, for 20 cubic feet
2 feet?and for every succeeding box it ought to be about double
that of the preceding one, or, generally, the widths of the boxes
must increase nearly in geometrical progression, 2:4:8, &c., and
their lengths in an arithmetical one, 3, 6, 9, &c.


For the stuff under notice their dimensions are thus in different
larger establishments as follow:
The first box is 6 feet long and I^-11 feet wide
? second ? 9 ? ?
? third ? 12 ? 4-5 ?
? fourth ~ 15-16 ~ 8-10 ~
Their depths depend on the angle of inclination of the sides,
which, as already stated, is generally 50�, because, if less, the
stuff would he liable to settle firmly and choke the central orifice,
and, if larger, unnecessary greater height of the boxes would be
required. The form of the two smaller boxes is commonly such,
that the two short sides are inclined at the above angle, and the
two long ones, which would become far steeper, are broken ? i.e.
are for a certain depth from the top vertical and afterwards inclined
at the normal angle (as in Figs.). This modification has, however,
no influence upon the action of the boxes, but simply facilitates
somewhat their construction and firm fixing. The sides of the
larger boxes are generally even throughout. The way, in which
the outlet holes (a) at the apices are constructed, has an important
bearing' on the operation of 'the boxes. At these points the
hydrostatic pressure is considerable, and the holes would naturally
be kept small, in order to prevent too much water passing with the
particles of stuff; such small outlets are, however, especially on the
treatment of coarser material, very liable to become choked. This
difficulty has been met by the holes being made of conveniently
large size, but connected with pipes (<?), | inch in diameter, which
rise up the sides of the boxes ? i.e. of the smallest box to within
feet, and of the others to within feet from the
top?and are there furnished with small mouthpieces ( d ), supplied
with taps for regulating the outflow. This arrangement, on
account of the outlets being so much higher, has the further
advantage, that a considerable amount of fall is gained (especially
as regards the large boxes), which, for the subsequent treatment of
the material is in some cases of special value. There are two more
points that require attention, in order to insure good action of the
apparatus, namely, the introduction of the material into the
different boxes equally and without splashing, and, further, to
prevent the entrance of chips of wood, gravel, or other impurities
that are likely to stop or otherwise obstruct the outlets. The first
point is met, either by having the supply-launders expanded fan-like


and furnished with dividing ledges ( h , Figs. 11 and 12), or by the
interposition of small troughs, the sides of which, nearest the box
to be supplied, are perforated near the bottom by equidistant, small
holes. The cleaning of the material, previous to its entering the
first box, is generally effected by the main supply-launder, being
made a little wider near the point of entrance, and the insertion at
this place of a fine wire-sieve across the launder, and somewhat
inclined against the stream. This sieve must be occasionally
looked after, to remove any impurities collected in front, and this,
in fact, is the chief attention, the whole apparatus requires ; for
otherwise it needs hardly any supervision. If once in proper
working order, its action is constant and uniform, provided the
material introduced does not change in amount and quality; and
it has this further advantage, as compared to the slime labyrinths,
that the classified stuff can, from the outlets, be directly conveyed
in small launders to the concentration machines for treatment,
without any previous preparation. One point, however, not in
favor of the apparatus is that, having to be placed between the
gold-mills and the concentration machines, a great fall of ground
is required, to permit the direct introduction of the material and
also to allow sufficient fall for the tailings; and thus, where local
circumstances are unfavorable, it has to be erected at a higher level,
and necessitates the use of Jacob?s ladders or pumps for lifting the
stuff. The action of the different boxes on the material under
notice with regard to the percentage of fluid matter and the
quantity and character of its solid contents, which they respectively
separate, is according to experiment as follows :
The small box separates 38-40 per cent., containing per
cubic foot 16-18 lbs. coarse sand.
The second box separates 20-22 per cent., containing per
cubic foot 13-14 lbs, fine sand.
The third box separates 18-20 per cent., containing per
cubic foot 15-16 lbs. coarse slime.
The largest box separates 10-12 per cent., containing per
cubic foot 10-12 lbs. fine slime.
These are results in every respect satisfactory for the further
concentration of the ore. As regards the loss, caused through the
final escape of impalpable ore from the last box, it amounts for
rich galena ores to about 6 per cent., and for quartziferous silver
ores to about 2% per cent


? Spitzlutten? (Triangular Double Troughs).
The third method of classification, effected in the so-called
?Spitzlutten apparatus ? a recent invention by Rittinger, is based
upon the principle that, if material, composed of particles different
in size and density, is exposed to a rising- stream of water, the
velocity of this stream may be so reg-ulated, that particles of certain
size and character sink and may be conveyed off, whilst the
remainder is carried upward by it; and that, consequently, by
repeating- this operation a certain number of times with a gradu-
ally decreased velocity of the rising stream each time, the material
can thereby be separated in as many different classes of grains.
The u Spitzlutten? (Figs. 13, 14, 15), by which this action is now rigs,
very simply produced, are constructed as follows;? Within a
triangular trough ( a ) of certain length and width, with two opposite
sides vertical and two inclined at angles of 60�, is a similar smaller
one ( h ), having the vertical sides in common with the larger
trough, but its inclined sides fixed at certain, equal distances
from, and parallel to, those of the latter. There is thus an open
Y-like space (c) left between the inclined sides of the two troughs,
representing, as it were, a rectangular pipe, sharply bent in the
centre; and it is through this, that the stream of material has to
pass? i.e. to fall and rise. The velocity of the stream depends on
the size of this space, and so does consequently also the size of the
particles, that will rise or sink in it. The cross section and respective
velocity stand in inverse relation to each other, and their determi-
nation for each double trough of a complete apparatus is a matter
of mathematical calculation, in which the size of the largest
particles and the specific weight of the material to be classified
form the main figures. For galena ores, such as those under
notice, and which are crushed so fine that the largest grains are
not more than 0 - 6 millimetre in diameter, the most satisfactory
classification into four different kinds of grains is, according to
Rittinger?s calculation, arrived at by a series of four double
troughs with the velocity of the stream decreasing from the first
to the succeeding troughs in the progression of 2-3, 0-94, 0-37,
OTS inches per second; and if the width of the channel for the
first trough is I*l inch, and its length 2 feet, the dimensions of
that of the second trough follow as 2-75 inches .' 2 feet. And as it
is not advisable to increase the width of the channels beyond
3 inches, the channels of the third and fourth troughs are each
3 inches wide, and respectively about 64-6 inches and 135 inches


long 1 . The mean depth of the channels, measured from the line of
inflow of the material to the lowest part of the inside trough, is
for the two smaller double troughs about 3 feet; for the two larger
ones about 4-6 feet. In order to carry off the coarse particles, that
sink in the channels, the inclined sides of the outside troughs do
not meet below, but are continued downward, forming a long and
narrow pyramidal opening (d), about inch wide at top. The
short sides ( e , Fig. 14) slope inwards at. an angle of not less than
50�, contracting the opening to a small hole (./) of about 1 inch
square at bottom, through which the material is discharged into a
horizontal pipe ( g, Figs. 14 and 15), that extends both ways a small
distance beyond the sides of the apparatus, and is connected at
the ends with vertical 1-inch pipes. One of these ( h) serves for
the outlet of the classified material, and is carried up to within
36-21 inches of the water-level in the channel ( c ) according to
the degree of fineness of the particles, that have to pass through
it, (the same as in the pyramidal boxes). At the top it is supplied
with a tap (i, Fig. 14) for the regulation of the outflow. The
other pipe (It, Figs. 14 and 15) conveys a supply of clear water,
furnished from a launder ( I ) supplied with a tap (in), and as the
w r ater in the pipe stands 6-8 inches above the water-level in the
trough, a small uniform pressure is produced, causing a forced
influx of water at the point (f), which is essential for good
classification. This water ?opposing itself to the downward current,
charged with sediment in the pyramidal channel ( d ) ?prevents
all hut the coarser particles and pure water passing into the pipe
(h), and thus only grains of the desired size are carried to the
outlet ( i ). With regard to the relative positions of the different
double troughs of the series, they are fixed exactly horizontal and
sufficiently below each other, to prevent any settlement of material
in the communication-launders (n), which are necessarily very
broad. Other particulars regarding proper working, supervision,
&c. are the same as those, given for the pyramidal boxes. According
to present experience a series of four of these double troughs
classifies as well and, for the two coarser kinds of grains, even better
and cleaner than a set of four pyramidal boxes, though for the
fine slimes these latter are generally preferred, as they effect the
desired settlement of the stuff more completely. A complete
apparatus of troughs requires also less fall and space than one of
pyramidal boxes, and is more easily regulated in cases of increased
or diminished influx of material. The necessary additional supply


of clear water might, however, form a drawback to its application
in cases, where this medium is scarce. As regards the results of
classification by the different troughs of the series, they are stated
to he as follows: ?The first, or smallest trough, separates from the
material supplied about 30 per cent, coarse sand; the second
trough about 25 per cent, fine sand; the third 20 per cent, coarse
slime; the fourth 15 per cent, fine slime.
4.?Concentration of the Classified Sands and Slimes.
For this purpose a number of different machines are in use,
viz. :?l. Common tyes , for the two first or coarser sizes of grains.
2. Percussion-tables ; some with firm, and others with elastic
bumping arrangement for all four classes of grains. 3. Con-
tinuously-acting side-throw Percussion-tables (a new invention
by Rittinger), generally used for the three coarser classes. 4. Ro-
tating Conical-tables (another new invention by Rittinger), gene-
rally used for the finest slime; and 5. Common sleeping-tables for
the two classes of slimes only.
The Tyes and Sleeping-tables
are well known as imperfect, and the great amount of manual
labor, they require, renders them expensive contrivances. Their
use is therefore restricted to the older and smaller establishments,
that do not admit of re-arrangement. In the newer ones they are
superseded by either the two old kinds of percussion-tables, or by
the newly invented one, No. 3, in connection with the rotating-
table; and of these two methods again, the latter has given in all
respects such general satisfaction, both as regards results and
cheapness of working, that it will soon replace the other in all
establishments, permitting its application.
The Old Percussion-tables (No. 2 ),
would, therefore, need no detailed description, but as it is a
machine of peculiar construction, and is especially well adapted for
treating? fine slimes, and therefore, the best substitute for the large
rotating-tables, where want of space prevents their construction,
some remarks concerning it might not prove without interest.
A table of this class is generally 12 feet long and 5 feet broad,
constructed of strong, even-grained pine-boards, has high cheeks,
gradually diminishing in height towards the front, and is sus-


pended by four chains, adjustable as to length?two near the head
and two near the foot. It is shoved a certain distance horizontally
forward, when the pressure is suddenly released, and it falls back
again with a jerk into its original position. This movement is
imparted in steady succession by means of two or three cams,
acting on a lever connected with the head of the table. The cams
are inserted in a wooden axle, which generally receives its re-
volving motion by an endless belt from the axle of a little water-
wheel, erected close by. On falling back, the table strikes against
a bumping-piece that is either fixed rigid? i.e. so as to deaden the
blow instantly ?or it has a certain elasticity, that imparts a quick,
oscillating motion to the table. Both these arrangements work
equally well ; the latter requires, however, fewer strokes during the
same interval of time than the former, in order to render its interme-
diate oscillations effective. The inclination of the table, the length
of throw, the strength of the blows (dependent on the tension of the
suspension chains), and their number have to be modified according
to the size of the stuff to be treated. For the treatment of coarser
sand tables with non-elastic bumping arrangement require, for
instance, 5-8 inches fall per fathom, a length of throw of 4-5 inches,
and 45-50 blows per minute; whilst, with the same inclination and
length of throw, only 10-12 blows are given to tables, furnished
with elastic bumping-pieces, as they are required to oscillate 8-10
times after every blow. On treating fine slimes, the inclination is
2-3 inches per fathom, and the length of throw is only inch ;
and as with this slight forward movement the blows cause very few
oscillations, the number given to this table amounts to 40, whilst
that given to the other is 60, per minute. In order to insure
satisfactory concentration of the ore on oscillating tables, the supply
of any of the four portions of classified material?as, for instance,
the quantity obtained from four pyramidal boxes?and its contents
of solid matter ought not to exceed the following figures:?
Coarse sand (first box), 16-20 cubic inches per second, with
36-45 lbs. weight of solid matter per cubic foot.
Fine sand (second box), 10-12 cubic inches per second, with
20-36 lbs. weight of solid matter per cubic foot.
Coarse slime (third box), 8-9 cubic inches per second, with
15-30 lbs. weight of solid matter per cubic foot.
Fine slime, (fourth box) 4-6 cubic inches per second, with
8-10 lbs. weight of solid matter per cubic foot.


For non-oscillating 1 tables both the supply and its respective con-
tents of solid matter require in all instances to be a little smaller.
The operation of these two kinds of percussion-tables is alike and
very simple. The material is conveyed from the respective classifier
in a small launder to the apex of a triangular inclined plane, with
side ledges, fixed a little above the head of the table (E I > n > m -,
Fig. 16). By means of small triangular or oblong wooden but-
tons, fixed upon the plane, it is distributed equally over the whole
width of the table, and the concentration is effected in the following
manner; ?A deposit of rich orey matter is formed near the head,
which gradually increases in thickness and spreads wedge-like down
the incline, whilst the waste matter is constantly passing off the
table in front. For coarse stuff a strong lad is generally employed,
to shove the settling stuff with a wooden rake gently against the
current, to facilitate the separation and escape of the waste. If the
table is working efficiently, the deposit will be compact, its surface
perfectly level, and it will show a marked difference in color between
the upper one-third and the lower two-thirds, whilst the fluid
material will play over it evenly in short regular ripples. After
the wedge-like deposit has increased to a depth at the head of 6-8
inches, the table is thrown out of action, and the deposit is divided
rectangularly across the table with a sharp shovel into 12-14
equal parallel portions (called shovels), the upper half of which are
removed to special bins close by, and, when collected in sufficient
quantity, are severally re-treated on a separate table, furnished
with a puddling arrangement. Whether any of the portions of
the lower half have to undergo a similar process, depends on the
ore they contain, which is generally estimated by the color. In
most cases the 3-4 lowest portions are thrown away as too poor.
From 1-3 portions, or those nearest the head of the table, that
amount on account of the wedge shape of the deposit to above
30 per cent, of the whole, are generally rich enough to produce by
the second concentration ore fit for metallurgical treatment, whilst
the other 4or 5 have to be re-worked respectively three and more
times, before they reach this state. The head portions contain also
a sufficient amount of fine free gold, to pay extraction by the
process, hereafter to be described. On examining the different
portions of the deposit with regard to their size of grain, it is
invariably found, if the table has worked well, that the lower
portions contain coarser, yet specifically lighter, particles than


those from the top. The working- effect of these percussion-tables
is, under ordinary favorable circumstances, such that from |-1 ton
of sands and slimes can daily he passed on one table through all
stages of concentration to that of smeltworthy ore.
The motive power, required for an oscillating table, is 0 - 114
horse; for a non-oscillating one 0 216? i.e. ; a little above one
horse-power is capable of moving ten tables of the first or five
tables of the second kind. In one or two establishments tables
are in use of 14-15 feet in length. These have at about one-third
of their length, measured from the front, small steps ? i.e. a table
of this class represents two floors, the front one of which lies a few
inches lower than the other. This modification, though designed
as an improvement upon the straight floor, does not, however, pro-
duce the promised effect, either upon the action or upon the results.
JRittinger?s Continuously-acting Side-throw Percussion-talle.
To simplify the construction and movement of these tables,
they are generally made so, that they represent one large table
(A, Fig. 16), divided by a cheek ( b) in the centre into two ( a 1 and
a 2), for the movement of which consequently only one arrange-
ment is required, rendering the percussion simultaneous for both.
The floor or platform of each table (a 1 and � 2 ), measured inside
the head-board and cheeks ( c ), which are about 4 inches high and
inch thick, is 8 feet long and 50 inches wide. It is generally
double boarded ( d , Fig. 17), the upper surface being made of
tongued-and-grooved l|-inch boards of some even, close-grained
wood (generally sycamore), planed as exactly as possible, and
slightly blackened by weak sulphuric acid. The boards are carefully
laid crossways, and fixed with wooden pegs to the lower floor, made
of pine-boards tightly screwed to a stout wooden frame, consisting
of 4-5 bars ( e ) lengthways and 3 ditto (f) across, which are mor-
tised and screwed together and secured by iron angle-braces. The
centre crossbar (/*) is nearly double as strong as the others, and
projects on both sides a certain distance beyond the platform. It
is called the tongue or percussion-har, as it forms the part to which
the side-movement and percussion of the table is imparted. The
double table is suspended by four iron rods ( g , Fig. 17), having-
adjusting shackles ( h ), and at either end eyes that are connected
with hooks (f), the upper ones screwed into stout uprights, that
form part of a strong framing (B), braced well together at top and


bottom f the lower ones screwed into the sides of the platform frame
at about one foot from either end. The arrangement for imparting
the side-way motion and percussion to the tables consists, in the first
instance, of a wooden axle (C, Fig. 16), furnished with 4-5 cast-iron
cams ( k ), opposite the centre of the table. This axle is turned by
an endless strap from a shaft, connected with the axle of the water-
wheel. The cams act upon ? i.e. push forward?the iron-faced pro-
jection of a vertically-suspended wooden lever which swings at its
upper end on small iron pivots between two crossbars connected with
the framing, whilst its lower end moves between guiding ledges,
nailed to the floor of the building. About level with the frame of
the table the ends of two wrought-iron bridles are joined to it by
means of a screw-bolt. These bridles transfer the forward move-
ment of the lever to the table by being fixed with a screw-collar
over a horizontal screw-spindle, that is fastened and adjusted on
top of the projecting portion of the percussion-bar or tongue,
and by means of which the length of the forward movement ?
i.e. the side-throw?can be regulated. The end of the projec-
tion of the percussion-bar, being slightly rounded off in front and
strengthened by an iron rim, presses, when at rest, against the
bumping-block (m) ?a stout square pillar ?,which is joined to a
foot-piece, 5-6 feet deep in the ground, and well stayed at the
back to resist the shocks, and its face, at the place of contact with
the percussion-bar, is generally covered with leather for the purpose
of deadening the blows. The pressure of the percussion-bar
against the bumping-block is produced by a stout spring (n) of
iron or some tough wood, attached to its prolonged end at the
opposite side of the table, and can be regulated by a screw (<?),
that adjusts the tension of the spring. Both prolongations of
the percussion-bar move on each side between two uprights (r),
connected with the outside framing, by which means the trans-
versal movement of the double table is guided. The following
(indicated in Figs. 16 and 17) is a somewhat more simple
arrangement for moving the table, and is similar to that, used for
the common percussion-table. The cams ( k ) of the driver (C) are
made to act against the iron-faced top end of a lever ( I ), that
moves on an axle (D) at foot, and to which is attached, by means
of a regulating screw ( s ), a horizontal wooden bar (q). This slides
between guides ( t ), fixed on top of the bumping-block (m), and at
the other end is in contact with an oblong block of hard wood (w),


screwed on top of the prolongation of the percussion-bar. In
order to prevent the horizontal bar and lever from jumping back
too far, when the table strikes against the bumping-block, the bar
is furnished with a bolt ( v ), which insures the normal position by
resting against the guiding-ledges ( t) on top of the bumping-
block ( m ). The other arrangements, as regards the spring, regu-
lation of pressure &c., are the same as above.
The tables receive their supplies of classified material and of a
necessary amount of cleaning water, evenly distributed by means
of triangular inclined dividing planes (E) ?furnished with wooden
buttons in the usual manner, ?from separate troughs (F, G), into
which the material and water are conveyed by small launders or
pipes (H) from the respective classifier and main water-launder.
The whole of this arrangement, inclusive of platforms (x) for the
workmen to stand on, rest on a low framing (I) above the head of
the table. There are generally three dividing planes (E r *? II- ? 111- ) for
each table, one of which (E 1 ) supplies the classified material for a
breadth of 8-10 inches at that side of each table, opposite to where
the percussion takes place, whilst the two others (E 11- and E 111 *)
provide the cleaning or washing water, the one nearest the percus-
sion side (E m ?) always in somewhat larger quantity; this supply
is therefore distinguished from the other as the hack-water , the
former being called the front-water.
The principle, upon which the ore-concentration on these tables
is based, differs from that of the common percussion-tables mainly
in the action of the percussion on the stuff treated, which instead
of horizontal is vertical, and produces two movements of the
particles, viz. one down the incline, the other forward; and in the
mean direction resultingfrom this? i.e. diagonally downward ?they
pass off the table. As now the heavier particles? i.e. the ore?are
not only thrown further, but are also, on account of their stronger
friction on the boards, more or longer exposed to the forward
movement than lighter ones (waste) during the same interval of
time, it follows that they travel outside these, gradually separate
according to their specific weights into distinct bands, and that
this separation becomes more perfect, the nearer they approach
the end of the table. The whole of this action is at the same time
enhanced by the a cleaning-water.? This prevents the stuff from
spreading at once all over the table; it cleans the outside streaks
of ore, and the stronger portion, or ? hack-waterf serves specially


for washing the ore finally off the apparatus. For securing the
partition of the different portions of ore, separated on the table,
small, pointed, movable pieces of wood, called tongues or
pointers (yyyy\ are screwed upon the table near its foot, by
means of which the streaks of ore are divided from that of the
waste and guided through narrow slits in the table, furnished with
sheet-iron lips, into separate launders underneath, that discharge
into settling or catch pits ; or else the ore passes off the table over
small movable strakes (z zz) into the launders (K) placed in
front (see Figs.). The waste runs off the table in both cases over
a broad strake (m) into a small launder (L) in front, that conveys
it to the main waste channel. In this, and in all instances, where
the discharge takes place over the front of the table, it is, like the
slits above mentioned, provided with sheet-iron lips, projecting about
2 inches, in order to prevent the stuff licking hack underneath.
The result produced by the operation of these tables on any of
the four previously classified portions of the stuff under notice is,
to divide them into five products, viz.: ?
1. Lead-ore, containing fine free gold.
2. Lead-ore, poor in gold.
3. Copper and iron pyrites, mixed with some lead-ore.
4. Poor ore-slime ( i.e . imperfectly concentrated); and,
6. Waste.
These run in as many well-defined streaks down the tables, and
are, as above described, parted by the pointers ( y ) and guided, the
first three, into launders communicating with separate settling-
pits ; the fourth into a strake, that conveys it to a catch-pit, from
whence a Jacob?s ladder, or lifting-wheel, raises it into a small
pyramidal box for re-classification ?the portion issuing from the
apex orifice being then conveyed to, and re-treated on, a separate
table. The quality of the three first portions of ore collected in the
settling-pits is such, as to render them fit for direct metallurgical
treatment, the auriferous portion being, however, previously sub-
mitted to gold extraction, as will be seen hereafter. There are
many conditions, as regards adjustment of stroke, supply of
material and washing water &c., necessary to insure the satis-
factory working of this machine. This is shown by the following
table (prepared by Mr. Franz Eauen), which gives the results of
practical experience in treating the four classified portions of sands
and slimes, both of auriferous lead-ores and silver-ores.

Another condition, not less important than those just given for
good concentration of the different classified portions of material,
is the proper regulation of the velocity of the throw. For the
tables, applied to the treatment of the two coarser sizes, it ought,
in the average, not to exceed 1 foot per second, whilst slime tables
require a velocity of stroke of only 0-5 feet per second; a greater
velocity causes the tables to slide, so to speak, from underneath the
particles of ore, thus retarding their progress.
The motive power, required for working a double table, is by
dynanometric experiments proved to be 0?26 horse-power; and the
working effect per hour of a single table is 55 lbs. weight of slimes
and 300 lbs. weight of sands. Six continuously-acting double tables
are capable of working in 24 hours 10-12j tons of crushed material,
classified by four pyramidal boxes. Four of these treat the four
classified portions ?i e. each table is devoted to one particular class?
and the two remaining ones are necessary for re-working the inter-
mediate products ? i.e. the imperfectly concentrated orey matter.
As regards supervision and manual labor required, one workman
is quite sufficient for attending on two properly adjusted double
tables. His principal work consists in looking after the right posi-
tion of the pointers, and the steady and regular supply of material
and cleaning? water. On comparing the relative quantities of ore
produced and the loss sustained during the same time by this and
the old percussion-table, the produce of the former is 3-4 per
cent, smaller than that of the latter, and its loss of ore about 2 per
cent, larger ? i.e. the new table loses 23-24 per cent., whilst the
old one only loses 21-22 per cent. These disadvantages of the.
new invention are, however, more than compensated by the greater
purity of its ore, effecting a saving both in transport and smelting
expenses, and more especially by the greater amount of free gold
contained in the auriferous portion. But it greatly excels the
old table on account of its continuous, steady self-action; and
consequently its working expenses are, without regard to wear and
tear, fully 60 per cent, lower than those of the other.
Rittinger's Rotating-table.
This machine, as already mentioned, is specially applicable for
the concentration of fine slimes, and for this operation is preferred
to both the common and side-throw percussion-tables. The con-
centrating portion? i.e. the table proper?may be described as a Fig.


shallow, inverted-conical or flat funnel-shaped ring-, consisting of
even grained, well planed 1-inch pine-boards. The inner diameter
is 16-18 feet, and the outer 5-6 feet, with an inclination of 6 inches
to its radial width. It is furnished round the outer periphery with
a rim of board 2-3 inches high, and is divided radially by narrow
battens into thirty-two equal segments, that are somewhat con-
tracted at the inner periphery by the ends of the battens being
split (see Fig. 18), where, attached to the end of each segment, is a
funnel-shaped descending pipe of wood or sheet-iron ( v ), serving
for discharge into receptacles beneath. This ring rests exactly
horizontal, or rather the boards, which it consists of, are fastened
horizontally crossways and watertight, upon sixteen radial wooden
bars or arras (r), attached by means of a cast-iron rosette ( q ) to a
central vertical wooden axle (s) of 16 inches diameter, to which (and
consequently to the table) a slow, steady revolving motion is imparted
by means of a tangent-screw, from a shaft, connected with the water-
wheel. The tangent-screw operates upon a finely toothed cast-iron
wheel, about 2�-3 feet in diameter, fixed on top of the axle. The
lower pivot of the latter turns in strong cast-iron bearings, whilst
the upper one revolves within an iron collar; the bearing and collar,
being fixed to a strong framing, consisting of eight radial spars at
top and bottom, connected, about 1 foot outside the circumference of
the table, by as many stout uprights ( u ), and strengthened above
and below by four braces, forming squares, near the centre. To
this framing are attached all supplementary portions of the table,
that take no part in its motion, such as the troughs for supply of
clear water and material, triangular distributing planes, <fec. The
respective positions of these are shown in the appended sketch
(Fig. 18) of the ground plan of the machine.
The circular trough (a), that supplies the material, consists of
boards or sheet-iron, is 3-4 inches wide, and extends over twenty
segments of the table. It rests horizontally on supports (n),
fastened to the uprights (u) of the framing, within about 2|
feet of the outer periphery of the table, and at such a height above
it, that the triangular distributing tables (c), that introduce the
material close within its rim, have a fall of at least 20�. The
bottom of the circular trough, from the point where a launder ( k )
introduces the material from the classifier? i.e. just at the centre
of the curve?,is saddle-backed at a fall of about \ inch per
foot, which prevents the stuff from settling. Up the centre of


the mouth of the launder (k) a small movable tongue of wood is
fixed to distribute the material equally towards both sides of
the saddle. There are generally four?sometimes five?square
openings ( bbbb) through the outer rim at the bottom of the trough,
also provided with tongues, to regulate the outflow of the material
on to as many triangular distributing tables (c 1 '' 11 ? lll ? ) : the
relative positions of the openings being such that one is near
each end of the trough, and the other two or three, as the case
may be, are placed respectively at equal distances from these and
between each other. As regards the triangular distributing
planes (c), they are fastened with their pointed ends by means of
bolts and eyes underneath the trough, whilst their lower edges
have hook-like strips of sheet-iron attached, by means of which
they hang firmly on the inner rim of the main dear-water trough
(d), presently to be described. This arrangement, though insuring
a fixed position of the planes, yet permits their easy removal in
cases of access to the table being required. They are, as usual,
constructed of pine-boards, to which oblong, wooden, distributing
buttons are fixed (see Fig.) j but they have, for the more equal
distribution of the material, attached to their lower edges either
pieces of sheet-iron with serrated lips, or are provided harrow-like
with a number of thin iron spikes (as in Fig.). The width of
these lower edges, which are concentric with the table, is one-
sixteenth of the circumference of the latter? i.e. each supplies two
of the thirty-two segments at a time.
The main Clear-water Trough (d), constructed of boards or
sheet-iron, is likewise circularly bent, and rests horizontally 3-4
inches above the circumference of the table on flat iron supports,
projecting from the uprights (w) of the framing. Its inner rim
lies just within the rim of the table; the outer one touches the
uprights, and is attached to them. It commences radially abreast
of one of the ends of the feeding-trough (a), just with the first
distributing plane (c 1 ), but it extends four segments beyond the
last distributing plane, (c lv- ) at the opposite end of the trough ( a ),
and encompasses in all twenty-four segments of the table. It is
constantly and in regulatable quantity kept supplied with clear
water by means of a tap (b). The amount required for concentra-
tion runs from the trough on to the circumference of the table
through open cuts (c I *, e 11 ', e m \ e IV ?) in its inner rim, inches
deep, and as wide as suffices for the supply of two segments
of the table. For the equal distribution of the water sheet-iron


plates, deeply serrated on both edges, are fixed in front of these
cuts (indicated by dark lines on the sketch). The teeth of the
lower edg-es of the plates stand about l|-2 inches off the surface
of the table, whilst those of the upper edg-es reach to within fl-
inch of the level of the outer rim of the trough. The number
of the places of overflow (c " ? ~I -> IV -) corresponds with that of
the distributing tables ( c ), furnishing- the material, and they are
so arranged, that if, for instance, there are four such tables, as in
the sketch, three overflows (c I *, e ll -, e m ) occupy the centres of the
spaces? i.e. they supply the two middle segments of the four
between these tables, whilst the fourth ( e' y ) lies two segments
beyond the fourth table. Adjoining this last place of outflow, and
communicating by a short spout ( h) with the main trough (rf), a
peculiarly constructed special clear-mater trough (/) commences
and extends horizontally in a flat curve across six segments of the
table to near the inner periphery of the latter, where its end rests
on a strong support (o), projecting from the nearest upright ( u) of
the framing. The outer rim of this trough is even, but the inner
one presents a succession of deep notches or breaks ( see sketch),
and the dark lines ( g) signify the places lower than the rest,
where the clear water flows over serrated sheet-iron plates, that
extend down to within 2 inches of the surface of the .table.
And as they thus have to follow the inclination of the table, whilst
the trough lies level, they become gradually longer towards the
end of the trough. The special purpose, which this trough serves
for the material under notice, is the separation of the pyrites from
the lead-ore. As regards the arrangement for washing this ore otf
the table, it consists of a vertical pipe (*), that by means of a flat
mouthpiece (m), ten lines wide and three lines high, discharges,
under a pressure of 8-9 feet and at a very oblique angle, a stream
of clear water on to the table near its rim. This pipe is closed at
the bottom, and communicates at the top with a reservoir or launder.
It rests on a support ( p ), projecting from the nearest frame-upright
(m), close outside the circumference of the table, and in the centre
of the space between the commencement of the main dear-water
trough (id ) and the end of the special one {f) just described, a spot
coinciding with the centre of the middle one of the three remaining
segments of the table.
For the separate reception of the three kinds of material?viz.,
waste, pyrites, and lead-ore?, that run off the table at its inner
periphery (through the funnel-shaped pipes ( v ) attached to the


contracted ends of the segments), either one circular trough ( t ),
divided by two partitions into three compartments, or else two
separate troughs, one within the other, are used, the outer one of
which is devoted to the waste, whilst the inner one receives the
two kinds of ore into separate compartments by means of two
short, shallow strakes, resting on top of the outer trough. The
positions and lenghts of the respective compartments correspond, of
course, with the number and positions of the segments of the table,
from which waste, pyrites and lead-ore are washed off. The troughs
rest on the foundation bars of the framing, and the compartments
for the three products communicate by holes in their bottoms with
separate launders underneath, that conduct the ore to settling-pits
outside the table and the waste into the main w T aste-channel.
The mode of action of this table is very simple, and its working
requires no manual labor whatever; the machine is, in fact, like the
new percussion-table ?self-acting. The process of concentration
on the two segments (1, 2) of sketch is, for instance, as follows:
Being coated with material by the triangular plane, (c 1 ) they pass,
during the slow rotation of the table, underneath the first overflow
(e) from the main dear-water trough ( d ), and the ore deposited on
them is cleaned from the waste; but, progressing further, they
receive a fresh supply of material from the second distributing table
(c? ), are again cleaned by the second overflow (e 11 ) of clear water,
and after having undergone this double operation twice more, they
progress underneath the special cleaning-trough (/). On account
of the inwardly-bent form of this trough, the numerous streams of
clear water, issuing from it at g g g..., act gradually on nearly the
whole surface of the segments, completely washing off the pyrites
and leaving them coated with pure lead-ore only, which, on further
progression, is also removed by the forcible stream of water, dis-
charged from the mouthpiece (w) of the vertical pipe (i). With
this operation a full rotation of the table is completed, and the
whole process, as regards the two segments, commences again.
But it will no doubt be understood, that every two segments com-
posing the table undergo the same operation in steady regular
succession, and that the concentration is thus continuous, as long
as the table rotates.
The conditions necessary for satisfactory working of the machine
are the following:?
1. The supply of material for four to five simultaneous coat-
ings ought not to exceed o*6-o'7 cubic feet per minute.


2. The solid contents per cubic foot of supply must not
amount to more than 1-1'25 lbs. weight.
3. 2'25-2'40 cubic feet of clear water are required per
minute. ? i.e. 0'75-o'Bo cubic feet for separating the
lead-ore from waste and p} T rites, and I's-I*6 cubic feet
per minute for washing it off the table.
4. The table must not rotate faster or slower than once
every ten minutes? i.e. six times per hour.
Comparative experiments, touching the relative merits of this
machine and the old percussion-table for the treatment of slimes,
have proved that, whilst on the latter an amount of material,
holding 45-50 lbs. weight of solid contents, can per hour be
passed through all stages of concentration to that of pure ore; the
rotating-table accomplishes the same result in like time from a
supply of similar stuff, containing 90-120 lbs. weight of solid
matter ? i.e. it concentrates fully double the quantity in the same
time. The concentrated ore from both machines is equal, as
regards purity, &c., hut, comparing the relative amounts produced,
viz., 80 per cent, by the new and 72 per cent, by the old one from
an equal quantity of material, it follows, that the old table loses
8 per cent, more than the new one.
As regards working expenses, the latter has also an important
advantage over the former; for its supervision can be accomplished
by a boy, whilst the manipulation on the percussion-table requires
a strong and experienced person, whose wages are of course con-
siderably higher, or nearly in the proportion of six to one. The
expenses for working an amount of material with five tons of solid
contents are, for instance, on the old table about twelve shillings,
on the new one a trifle over two shillings. The motive power
required for one of these tables is very small indeed, considering
the size of the machine:?one horse-power is quite sufficient to
turn ten to fifteen of them.
There is a further special advantage connected with the con-
struction and mode of action of this rotating-table, namely, that
with some modification in the arrangement of the supply and clean-
water troughs, &c. and some additions, two different classes of
material can, if required, be worked separately on one and the
same table. For this purpose two of the four triangular distri-
buting planes have to be devoted to each class of stuff. The
supply and reception troughs have to be properly partitioned off,
and there are in addition required one special cleaning-trough


and one pipe for washing- off the ore ?both intermediate between
the two pair of triangular planes?and also double the number of
launders for the supply of the stuff and conveying- the products to
their respective settling- pits.
5. ?Extraction of the Gold from the Concentrated
Orey Matter.
To this process, which yields from 25 per cent, to 30 per cent,
of the total produce of gold, are submitted besides the stuff saved
by the canvas strakes, attached to the g-old-mills, also that classed
as auriferous lead-ore from the side-throw percussion-table; the head
portions of pure ore, obtained from the common one, and those from
the old tyes, here still in use (see treatment of ? Waschgiinge ?).
The process consists in a real washing- operation, that requires much
skill and experience on the part of the workmen, and is executed in
an apparatus called the
? Goldlutte? (Washing-trough).
A strong wooden trough 10-12 feet in length, 16-22 inches
wide and 10-12 inches deep, fixed at an inclination of inches
per foot, but at the same time exactly level transversely. Its upper
end is closed, the lower one open, but contracted to about one-half
by two narrow ledges, projecting from the sides, and there are two
or three small catch-pits in front of it. At the upper end is a small,
rectangular compartment, several inches shallower than the sides
and formed by the insertion of a sliding board across, which is
supplied with clear water by a tap at the back. The peculiar
feature of this apparatus is, that the inner surface of the bottom
board is from the compartment downward roughened by numerous
deep scratches and knife cuts, that run obliquely crossways from
both sides, intersecting each other somewhat like net-wprk. The
washing manipulation in this trough is very similar to that in
a common tye:?From a hopper, fixed close over the head of
the trough, small portions of ore-slime are introduced, and placed
dam-like in front of the partition, and the water, entering simulta-
neously, flows evenly over the rim of the latter and distributes
itself equally over the surface of the ore, carrying it gradually
down the incline ; whilst a workman, stationed at the side of the
trough, sweeps it with a short, soft broom obliquely against the
current, proceeding from the lower end upward from.one side to the
other. Generally, after every half-hour, the thin deposit of ore-


slime remaining on the bottom, whilst only clear water is let to
play over it, is gently brushed against the stream, till the greater
portion of the ore has been washed off. The remainder, especially
that in the numerous scratches of the bottom, consists of very fine,
nearly slimy gold and small globules of quicksilver (lost by the
mill process), intermixed with galena-slime. This is carefully
brushed down the incline into the wooden, scoop-shaped gold-
cleaner, the ? scheidetrog? (described when noticing the alluvial
diggings), held by a second workman in front of the outlet, and
whilst this man cleans the gold and quicksilver in the manner
explained, the other recommences the operation in the trough. The
ore-slime, caught in the pits in front of the trough, is, according to
its auriferous character, worked over once or twice more, generally
in a separate trough, or if too poor, classed with the other ore for
the smelting works. In order to determine, whether the scoop-
shaped gold-cleaner might not advantageously be used entirely by
itself for the extraction of the geld from the ore-slime, a sufficient
quantity of blanket stuff is divided into two equal portions, and
one of these treated in the manner just described, the other by the
gold-cleaner only. The yields of gold stood in the proportion of
73 .* 100 or 27 per cent, in favor of the gold-cleaner. The extra
wages for working the latter amounted, however, to double the
value of the surplus of gold obtained.
Amalgamation of the Gold-slime and Retorting of the
, Amalgam.
After a sufficient amount of the gold-slime has been accumulated
by the former process, it is mixed with a small quantity of quick-
silver, and amalgamated in a cast-iron mortar with a wooden
pestle. Amalgam of this kind, after being well squeezed through
chamois leather or close canvas, contains 40-50 per cent, of gold ?
i.e. nearly 20 per cent, more than that obtained from the gold-
mills; ?a difference that may, perhaps, be explained by supposing
that this amalgam, on account of its quick formation, holds only as
much quicksilver as will bind the particles of gold together without
penetrating, entering, far into their mass; whilst during the
mill process the gold grains are so long exposed to the action of the
quicksilver, that it gradually dissolves them and forms a chemically
constituted amalgam, not alterable by any mechanical pressure.
The apparatus used for retorting the balls of amalgam, obtained


by the last process and from the gold-mills, consists of a small
round furnace, built of firebricks, 4 feet high, with an inner
diameter of 22 inches, and covered at the top by a circular plate
of cast-iron, provided with a round hole in the centre for the re-
ception of a sheet-iron chimney-pipe. The grating of this furnace
has a circular hole in the centre, into which fits the retort, a strong
cast-iron cylinder of 9 inches inner diameter and 15 inches high,
supplied with a stout, tightly-fitting cover and contracting at the
lower end to a short neck, 3 inches wide. This portion is inserted
and tightly fixed with luting into one end of a curved iron pipe,
the other end of which protrudes through the wall of the furnace,
and is connected by a close joint with the upper part of a vertical
pipe of 7 inches inside diameter. This latter pipe is closed at the top
by an iron plate, provided with a wooden plug through the centre,
whilst its lower end opens over a basin standing in a cistern, filled
and kept constantly supplied with cold water during the process of
distilling. The balls of amalgam are placed on a number of cir-
cular sheet-iron trays, about 8 inches in diameter, that, by means
of pipe-like collars, rising from their centres, are slid one on top
of the other over a round iron upright, screwed to an iron tripod
or cross that serves as foot. Thus arranged, the whole is introduced
into the cylindrical retort ; the cover of the retort is then tightly
fixed and carefully luted with a mixture of brickdust and clay;
charcoal is filled into the furnace round the retort; the small iron
chimney is inserted into the top plate of the former, and the
firing commences. Generally about an hour after, the quicksilver
begins to distil into the basin, and in about 2�-3 hours the opera-
tion is finished. After the furnace is sufficiently cooled down, the
tray arrangement is taken out of the retort, and the gold-balls are
brushed clean and sent to the laboratory for refining. The com-
position of this gold is in the average 62 per cent, fine gold and
38 per cent, fine silver.
In order to show the yearly production of ores and metals, and
the extent of the ore-dressing, works of the mining district of
Schemnitz, two tables (prepared by Mr. Franz Fauen) are ap-
pended, the first of which shows the yearly average yield for the
ten years from 1853-62, which is not expected to alter during the
current ten years, whilst the second table gives the number of
establishments, dressing-machines, &c., in operation, and the
number of workmen employed, in the year 1866.

In addition to those given in the table the district possesses other
]5 establishments, containing 30 stamping-mills, with, in all,
327 stamps, 120 tyes and strakes, and 18 common percussion-
tables, that are at a stand-still for want of ore from the respective
mines, till a deep tunnel, the ?Joseph 11. , Erhstollen? is
finished.
It may not be considered out of place, if in conclusion a few
remarks are added, touching the Hungarian mode of gold extrac-
tion and the value, some of the machines described might be for
Victorian gold mining. It will, no doubt, have been observed in
the foregoing description, thafc the extraction of gold at Schemnitz
is rather a supplementary process, the gold being obtained as a
by-product, so to speak, whilst the dressing and concentration of
the lead-ore, &c. is the main object. However, even considered
in that light, it must have created some astonishment, that so small
an amount of gold as 2 dwts. per ton on the average pays extraction
by any special process. The reason for this consists principally in
the economic and attentive mode of working, and the low rate of
wages prevailing for the men and boys, employed in the ore-
dressing establishments, which, though the work is generally paid
by contract, or according to a graduated percentage on the
produce, hardly rises for the men to above 65,, for the boys to
above Is. 6d. per week, but is more frequently lower. At such
a rate of wages, and with the crushing performed for some other
object, I have no doubt quartz reefs, too poor to pay at present
working expenses in Victoria, would yield handsome profits. A
great deal of the success of the Schemnitz gold extraction is, how-
ever, also due to the very efficient construction and working of the
Hungarian gold-mills. Remembering the cheap manner of work-
ing these machines, the large percentage of the gold, that they
extract ?gold too fine to be seen by the naked eye?, and the rather
unfavorable circumstances of its being combined with so heavy an
ore as galena, they must surely be considered excellent amalga-
mators, and ought to work even more advantageously, where the
gold is coarser and its matrix lighter. The (as must be supposed)
unsuccessful trials, that these mills have formerly had in Victoria,
were perhaps made without the knowledge of the required amount
of influx of materia], the number of rotations, and principally of
the special adjustment of the runner?viz., that the knife-like blades
in the bottom ought not to touch the mercury; otherwise it can


hardly be explained, why they should not have come into at least
partial use. As we hear from our goldfields such frequent com-
plaints of a great deal of fine free gold being lost, I think these
mills might certainly deserve a trial. In doing so, it would be
advisable to interpose a certain number of them (depending on the
amount of stuff passing) between the blanket-tables and upper
mercury troughs, which latter should not be abandoned, as they are
admirable appliances, and give very little trouble in working.
The difficulty might however arise, that in the generality of cases
in Victoria the quartz is not crushed fine enough, to insure proper
working of the mills ; and if finer crushing were adopted, it would,
on account of the proportionally smaller quantities of stuff worked
through, perhaps produce a greater disadvantage than the mills
could redeem. This drawback could, however, easily be overcome
by the previous separation of the coarser sand from the crushed
material, after its passage through the troughs, by either of the
two classifiers described (pyramidal boxes or triangular double
troughs), the proper size of which would, of course, depend on
experiment.
The second Schemnitz process of gold extraction from the
blanket-sand ?viz., by the tye-like trough ( goldlutte ) and gold-
cleaner?is, as regards results, certainly effective enough, but
would not be applicable in Victoria, on account of the great
expense for manual labor attached to it ; and the barrel amalga-
mation, generally adopted here, is no doubt preferable.
Touching the fine self-acting classifying and ore-concentration
machines, due to the inventive genius of Mining Councillor von
Eittinger, they perform their work really in an excellent manner,
and I took special care to describe them in detail, as far as I was
able, being impressed with the belief, that they are well adapted for
the saving of the pyrites occurring in our reefs, which no doubt
increases in quantity, the deeper the workings extend, but is at
present more or less lost during crushing. One or other of the
two described classifiers would, under any circumstances, have to
be adopted; for the difference between the specific gravities of
quartz and pyrites being so small ? i.e. quartz about 2?65, iron
pyrites (which generally contains most gold) 4 9, and arsenical
pyrites 6T ?, exact classification is requisite to effect a satisfactory
saving of the latter. With regard to the two new concentration-
machines, viz., the side-throw percussion-tableTind the new funnel-


shaped rotating-table, I am rather in doubt, whether I should prefer
to use them or two splendid machines, used in the Hartz mines for
concentration of fine pyrites and galena sands and slimes; viz., the
self-acting jigging machine , and the conical self-acting rotating-
table, both invented by Mr. Fr. Schell, Inspector of ore-dressing
establishments, and of which, I believe, models exist in the Mel-
bourne Mining Museum. These machines work so excellently upon
a highly quartziferous ore (far more closely resembling the crushing-
stuff from our quartz reefs than the Schemnitz crude-ore), that they
are preferred to the Hungarian machines, which I was told had
been tried. The combination of the self-acting jigging machine
for the coarser classified portion, and of the side-throw percussion-
table for the finer portion, would perhaps be the most likely to
solve the problem of the concentration of the pyrites. And at all
establishments, where these machines and the necessary classifiers
were introduced, it would then be advisable, to apply the Hungarian
mills also for the saving of the fine, free gold from the finer classified
portions. Respecting the stamping-mills, I have no hesitation in
saying, I saw none either in Hungary, the Hartz, or Saxony,
that were equal to the better class of Victorian stamping-machinery,
both as regards fine construction and rapidity with exactness of
action: only the new modification of the battery box for crushing
under water ?viz., IHttinger's Stausatz ?, that is so highly praised
at Schemnitz, claims special attention, and if similarly constructed
boxes have not been used in Victoria, they well deserve a trial.
