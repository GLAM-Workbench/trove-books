TARRANGOWER.
PAST AND PRESENT.
At the commencement of the year 1853, Mount Tarrangower,*
although but twelve miles from the then rising township of
Castlemaine, and the great diggings of Forest and Campbell’s
Creeks, was unknown to most of the inhabitants of those
districts. It is true its rounded top, surmounted by one
conspicuous tree, might be seen towering upward, but other-
wise it attracted little or no attention. However, at the end
of that year, a rumour got abroad that a new gold-field had
been discovered in its neighbourhood, called Bryant’s Ranges,
being situated on a run of a squatter of that name. At this
time new rushes were very common, and everybody’s occupa-
tion seemed to be going to as many as possible, let them be
far or near. Many, therefore, set out in search of this new
El Dorado, and many lost their way in the bush for days ere
they succeeded in finding it. When discovered, on the 11th
December, a Polish captain, named Meschosk (since dead),
known as a great prospector for new gold-fields, was found
working with eight men in a gully at the foot of the Mount,
near to where the Royal Hotel now stands. They were sinking
and slabbing a hole, and not finding payable stuff on the first
bottom, were sinking for a second. The next place opened
was Long Gully, and the two men who had the luck to find
payable gold were Costick and “Windy Jack.” Their claim
was opposite to where the Welcome Quartz Claim now is, and
the gold was obtained at a depth of ten feet. On the dis-
covery, the few that stood round, anxiously awaiting the result,
* Native Name: Tarra-na-gower —Big Rough Mountain.


set up three hearty cheers on seeing the rich prospects of the
first dish, and immediately marked out their claims and began
sinking. Christmas drawing near, they agreed amongst them-
selves that they would spend it in Castlemaine, but on no
account say anything about their discovery. The time arrived,
and off they all started, leaving their claims entirely unpro-
tected, and, as they considered, quite safe. Alas !on their
return some days afterwards, what was their dismay and
disgust at finding their claims had been discovered and worked
out. An extensive rush now took place, and new hills and
gullies were rapidly opened. But the great drawback, as at
most new diggings, was the want of water —only a small
quantity could be obtained at some natural springs ; but it
became necessary, to preserve this water for drinking purposes,
therefore most of the wash-dirt had to be carted to the river
Loddon, a distance of six miles, or Chinaman * or Muckleford
Creeks, an expensive operation in those days, so that only very
rich dirt would pay. However, a good surface hill was dis-
covered (named Growler’s Hill, from the numerous disputes
and fights which took place respecting claims), which turned
out very rich—as much as a pound weight of gold being
obtained from a cart load of dirt. The gully below the hill
also proved very rich, as well as Porcupine, Eaglehawk, Long
Gully, &c. The rush from the first being an extensive one,
the payable ground, as it was then termed, was soon worked
out, and the great Maryborough rush breaking out, fairly cleared
Tarrangower of its population, except a few who were content
with doing well, or making at least a good living.
How, there was one thing in particular which struck the
attention of everybody who visited these diggings, that was
the vast number of quartz reefs running direct north and south
all over the district. Also, upon examination, these reefs were
most of them found to contain gold in greater or less quantities.
Quartz-reefing was then a thing unknown, but still on many
of the surface reefs the gold was so thickly distributed that
women and children might be seen engaged with a hammer
breaking the little nuggets out of the quartz ; this was also a
Sunday’s amusement with many of the diggers, w T ho went
out, as they termed it, to collect a few specimens by way of
curiosity.
* So named from a solitary Chinaman’s grave being found there.


About a year or two after Tarrangower bad been deserted, a
mania arose all over the colony for quartz reefing and crushing,
and great was the rush of diggers and others to obtain claims
on those reefs which were known to contain gold, more espe-
cially those of Tarrangower and Bendigo. So rich did some
of these claims turn out, that, with the rudest kind of crushing
machinery, together with the high charge made for crushing,
loss of gold, and rate of wages averaging from £5 to £7 per
week per man, large, very large fortunes were rapidly made.
But the strangest thing with regard to these reefs was that the
richest were discovered by mere chance. For instance, Lisle’s
Reef, situated on the Mount, was discovered by a man looking
for a horse. Being fatigued, he sat himself down on the grass,
and picking up a piece of quartz, discovered gold in it. Upon
further examination, he found the reef cropping up through
the surface, and many of the stones thickly impregnated with
the precious metal. Acquainting Dr. Lisle with his discovery,
they marked out a claim, and from this claim alone in a few
months was taken about £34,000 worth of gold, and it has
since been worked to advantage by other parties.
Again, the richest claim on Nuggetty Reef, or rather, the
reef itself, was found by a lad named A, Pettitt, while in search
of some working-bullocks which had strayed. This claim has
been worked by Messrs. Chrystal, Pettitt, and Co., the
full extent being only 39 feet 3 inches, the reef at the widest
14 feet, and the present depth 280 feet. From this small
extent of ground over 25,000 ounces of gold has been taken,
and there is every prospect of the claim continuing to yield
richly. It is believed, taking into consideration the small
extent of the ground, that it is the richest claim in the known
world. The greatest yields have been as follows :—2 tons
quartz, SGO ounces gold ;1| tons, 230 ounces gold; and from
one week’s crushing 1250 ounces. The next claim south
(Walker and Co.’s) has also proved immensely rich. From 40
buckets or barely one ton of quartz, 225 ounces of gold has
been obtained; and from 18 buckets, 81 ounces. Other
claims have also turned out exceedingly rich. Many individual
miners have realised fortunes from the numerous reefs through-
out the district, but space will not allow of more than a slight
notice of some of the principal finds.
From the Eaglehaw’k Company’s ground, in February, 1861,
from ten feet square, a patch was taken, the amount of which


was 2000 ounces. The specimens were supposed to be the
richest ever found, one stone, barely 7 lbs. weight, yielding 7 8
ounces. On the same reef, Messrs. Gent and Crisp extracted
from one ton, 330 ounces, Coubrough and Co., and many
others, had also rich claims.
Faull, Rodda, and Co. were about the first reefers on the
celebrated Beehive. From their first claim (Isaacson’s at pre-
sent) they raised a large quantity of stone, from the surface to
the depth of 20 feet, averaging 300 to 400 ounces to the ton.
Their next claim (now Vivian and Co.’s) was equally rich, one
small patch of about six inches yielding nearly 3 lbs. weight
of the precious metal.
Wilson’s Reef, first worked by Wilson and Harris, has also
produced, and is still producing, a large amount of gold.
Wilson and Harris worked the claim for three years, their
quartz averaging 183 ounces, and obtained altogether upwards
of 8900 ounces. These men also had a claim on Swiper’s
Reef, in a portion of which the stone yielded from 30 to 40
ounces to the ton.
German Reef has also turned out a large quantity of gold.
From Faull and Prime’s claim, ten tons (one week’s work)
yielded 270 ounces. Robinson and Co. took up a claim which
had been left after being worked to the depth of 90 feet; in
the space of two years, after paying expenses, they divided the
handsome sum of <£10,563 15s. 4d. Barclay and Co.’s claim
of 40 feet averaged (crushing all) ounces to the ton, or
about £lO,OOO.
One claim on Parkins’ Reef yielded 16 ounces to the ton, to
the depth of 60 feet. There are also numerous other reefs
which have yielded very rich patches, and there is still every
hope and prospect that they will continue to do so.
The first large crushing machine erected on these diggings
was David Chrystall’s, in Long Gully, now Robert Oswald’s.
Some of the machines are at present re-crushing the old tail-
ings, which well, Messrs. Faull and Noel being the first
to set the example. Robinson and Co. are erecting a machine
for that purpose.
Reefing now seeming to be so productive of wealth, and to all
appearance far more profitable and lasting than alluvial mining,
a steady working population began to settle in the district.
The Government had planned out a site for a township, but
somehow the inhabitants and storekeepers chose another, and


soon, in place of canvas and calico tents, rickety stores, and
rough shanties, which are the true characteristics of all new dig-
gings, a well formed township began to arise, shops having
plate glass fronts, and exhibiting articles not only of use but
luxury, well-built and comfortable] hotels, churches, chapels,
schools, and neat wooden cottages. This township, known as
Tarrangower, was rechristened by a lady who gave it the name
of Maldon, which it now bears. A year or two passed away,
and the rich claims on the various reefs were thought to be
nearly worked out, that is, they would not pay small parties
of four or six men. Then suddenly sprang into existence a
mania for public companies, with high-flown prospectuses,
promising unbounded wealth to lucky shareholders. These
companies were mostly formed and brought before the public
by puffing sharebrokers and unscientific miners and engineers.
Small claims known to contain gold were bought up, and large
grants of ground taken. Expensive and in many cases use-
less machinery was erected, and everybody in any way con-
nected with these schemes imagined they were on the royal
road to fortune. As a proof of the extent of speculation at
this time, it is only necessary to state that there were nearly
twenty public companies, represented by a capital of at least
£190,000. But alas, like the great railway mania of 1846,
this dream of unbounded wealth vanished, the bubble burst,
and the day of reckoning came. The true state of things
could no longer be disguised, down, down went the value of
shares, until, at the present time, the most fortunate men in
Maldon are those who do not possess any of those now almost
valueless pieces of paper.
But it is thought by many, and not without reason, that a
change for the better will eventually come, and that in future
the companies will be worked on less expensive principles, and
also that many of the reefs at present unworked, and known
to be auriferous, will ultimately be made to yield gold in suf-
ficient quantities to pay.
Shortly after the discovery of the alluvial diggings of
Maldon proper, various other places in the district were found
to be auriferous, such as Muckleford, Sandy Creek, Nuggetty
Flat, and Bradford ; the two former proving rich, not only in
alluvial gold, but also in numerous reefs, which are still being
worked to advantage.
It may not be uninteresting to know that the first gold-


buyers were Messrs. Jamieson and Moore, and Mr. Alfred C.
Wills, at present warden at the Omeo. The quality of the
gold found throughout the district is good, averaging 23 carats.
Since November 3rd, 1857, to December Bth 1863, the amount
of gold sent down by escort has been 308,562 oz., added to
which four years previous to the escort, when the alluvial dig-
gings were at their palmiest, say, at a moderate calculation,
1,500 oz. per week, or 312,000 oz., and by private hand since
escort was established, at least 400 oz. per week for six years,
or 124,800 oz. Total, 745,362 oz., which, at £4 per oz.,
reaches the enormous sum of £2,981,448.
It is a noticeable feature in the quartz reefs of this district
that crystals are seldom found in them, and when found are
generally small and clear. Yet portions of large quartz
crystals have been found in the alluvial drift, some measuring
seven inches in diameter, and well proportioned, some being
perfectly clear and transparent, and others dark and opaque.
Topaz, beryl, and amethyst of large size and various degrees
of color and purity, have been found in the drift of the gran-
itic portion of the district. In most instances the discoveries
of these crystals and stones are made by the working miner,
and it is to be feared many are lost or thrown away from the
difficulty of ascertaining their true value, and also there being
no museum or classified collection of minerals and precious
stones by which an opinion could be formed by comparison.
Mr. Hornsby, M.8.C., has several valuable specimens in his
possession.
There are few townships on the diggings, especially for its
size, can boast of so many comfortable and substantial dwelling
houses as are here scattered about in every direction. Pretty
little villas and neat cottages, surrounded by tastefully laid-out
gardens, are to be seen on every side ; and it is a pleasure to
know that nearly all of them belong to sober, steady, hard-
working men —men who in the good times worked hard and
saved their earnings, invested them in a piece of land large
enough for their wants, and then established comfortable
homesteads for their wives and families. It certainly would
afford much surprise and pleasure to a person fresh arrived
from the old country, to be taken round and shown many of
these snug retreats, and to tell him that they were the homes
of the steady, hard-working men of Australia. It is indeed a
treat to enter many,of these places, and see the taste displayed,


and the numberless little comforts and luxuries by which they
are surrounded. Many of these cottages belong to Cornish
quartz-reefers, who are nearly all Wesleyan Methodists, and
many staunch teetotallers.
There are many pretty rides and drives in and around
Maldon, but the favourite is decidedly a drive to the Loddon
(Baringhup), a distance of seven miles. This, on a Sunday
afternoon, especially in summer, is the chosen of the upper ten,
who have traps and horses of their own, and also by those who
can afford to hire them. The great attraction seems to be not
only the pleasant ride, but to visit that most good-natured and
jovial of hosts, friend Lawrence, of the Loddon Hotel.
The house and garden is pleasantly situated on the river banks,
and the land around under cultivation. This is also a
rendezvous in summer for amateur fishermen (Loddon cod being
both plentiful and good), and in winter for wild duck shooters.
Agricultural shows and pigeon matches are also held here.
An agreeable drive may also be taken through Sandy Creek
towards Newstead, especially in spring time, when the fragrant
wattles are in full bloom, and the new grass on the ranges fresh
and green.
There is another drive which would doubtless be more
patronised than it is at present if the roads were in better
condition ; this is the road to Castlemaine via Muckleford.
The Orville Hotel, at Muckleford, is a neat comfortable road-
side house, kept by Mr. Creber, an old and much esteemed
resident of the district. The lovers of the gentle art will
mostly find good sport during the summer season in the creek,
which runs near the house, which abounds in black fish, trout
(Australian), and Cray fish.
From the huge granite ranges, which run from the Springs
through Nuggetty, some fine views of the distant country
may be obtained.
A walk up the Mount, when the weather is clear and not
too hot, will repay the trouble, as the view from the summit
is very extensive ; but like most Australian scenery there is
too much black looking bush, too little cultivated land, and
an entire absence of lakes or rivers, which in other countries
add so much to the beauty of the scenery. On the summit is
a cairn erected by the Government surveyors. The height of
the Mount above the sea is 1844 feet.
The hills and valleys on every side of Tarrangower are


„ oats ... 734 ... „ 22,945 „

admirably suited for the growth of the vine and cultivation of
the grape. This new branch of industry is making rapid
strides in every part of the colony, and Maldon is not back-
ward in the progress. The cultivation of the white mulberry
tree, for the purpose of rearing the silkworm, it is to be hoped,
will not be overlooked, for, beyond all doubt, silk will in the
course of a few years be a great source of profit to those who
enter upon its production in a systematic and extensive scale.
The ranges are also well adapted for the growth of the olive
tree.
The rich and fertile agricultural division of Baringhup,
Newstead, Muckleford, and Walmer, yield a very fair average
quantity of produce. On Mr. Bromfield’s farm as much as 40
bushels of wheat was obtained from one acre. According to
the report of the Registrar-General, for the year ending 21st
March, 1862, the return is as follows :
Tarrangower, 1862,
Number of occupiers, 49 ; acres under cultivation, 9357.
Acres under wheat ... 1247 .
„ oats ... 734 .
Produce ... 25,098 bushels
Total in cultivation ~. 2538 acres
Since the above, a considerable extent of fresh land has
been cleared and brought under cultivation. There is evi-
dently some mistake in the above return as to vines, as it is
well known there are at least 200,000 planted in the district;
and how these can flourish in so small an area as one acre is
rather difficult to imagine.
REMINISCENCES OF THE GOOD OLD TIMES.
The following anecdotes, which are strictly true in every
particular, the writer hopes may afford some amusement, and
be considered nJI altogether out of place.


Old Jack Spree, as he was called, was, as his name indicates,
a confirmed drunkard. One day he was found dead in the
cellar of a public house. Now Jack was a married man, and
when seen together with his better-half, it might justly be
said —
‘ 1 Oh, sure a pair was never seen
So justly formed to meet by nature.”
For a considerable time after Jack’s death, his disconsolate
widow daily consoled herself by getting in a state of semi-
intoxication. On meeting one of her friends or any one she
knew, she would stop and address them after the following
style :—“ Ah ! poor old Jack, dear, kind old Jack, where shall
I ever meet with another such a good old soul. Oh ! many’s
the time he would get drunk, and then I would get drunk, and
then we’d both get drunk together, and then he kick me into
a water-hole. Oh ! poor Jack, good, kind old Jack ; I shall
never get another like him, never, never.”
A digger (a hatter) having a good payable claim, used to
knock out two or three loads of wash-dirt, and then have it
carted down to a neighbouring creek. On several occasions
he fancied that the heap in the morning did not look quite so
large as when he left it on the previous evening, although
some pains seemed to have been taken to prevent it being
seen that any had been stolen. However, so convinced was
he of the fact, that he determined to set a trap, and await the
result. Accordingly he had two or three loads of wash-dirt
carted down as usual, and just before knocking off work he
mixed with it, more especially near the surface, about a pound
of finely chopped mutton fat. He then went to the police,
stated his suspicions and what he had done, asking, at the same
time, for one of the police to accompany him on the following
morning. The day arrived, and going out followed by the
policeman at a distance, he first examined his heap, and, as
usual, found it had received a gentle skimming. He then
walked along the creek, carelessly chatting with the diggers at
work, until he came to one w T ell-known bad character who
was engaged puddling in a tub. Just at the moment he came
up the man was in the act of pouring the water out of the tub,
on the surface of which he saw sundry little bits of fat. See-
ing this, he quietly made a signal to his friend, the policeman,
and then turned to the man and said —“ Why, mate, you seem
to have a very greasy sort of a claim from the quantity of fat


I see floating in your tub.” “ Why,” said the man in reply,
stammering, “ the fact is, I always uses tallow candles, and
they gutters so, that’s where them ere bits of fat comes from.”
“ Oh ! indeed, is it ? now, I rather think they come out of my
wash-dirt, which you seem so fond of helping yourself to.”
“What’s that you say?” exclaimed the rascal, making ready
to strike a blow, “ what’s that?”— but his speech was sud-
denly cut short by the appearance of the policeman, so turning
round he started off like a hunted deer. A cry of “ stop thief,”
however, had the desired effect, he was captured, and received
the just reward for his roguery.
Numerous were the frauds practised in early times both in
buying and selling gold. The following are examples:—
There was once a fellow on the diggings known as the
u nobby gold-buyer ” from his showy appearance and style of
dressing. There was one thing about him which would be sure
to strike the most casual observer, and that was his luxurious
and well-oiled crop of curly hair. Now, his manner of
manipulating gold to his own advantage was as follows : —On
a digger entering his office to sell gold, he would first care-
fully examine it, and, if fine, he would pass his fingers first
through his hair, and then handle, or rather finger the gold ;
this he would do several times, chatting away with the digger
in a most agreeable off-hand manner ; he finally weighed the
gold and stated the amount. Perhaps it would happen that
the digger knew the right weight, and would say—“ Why,
when I weighed that gold it was full a pennyweight more than
yon make it.” “Well, my good fellow,” he would reply,
“If you are not satisfied take it elsewhere, I don’t want to
cheat you.” Could the digger have seen him that same even-
ing carefully washing a fine curly wig in a basin of warm
water he would have been able to account for the difference in
the weight.
As the trick could only be played off on fine gold, he had
another always ready for coarse gold. This he would put into the
usual copper scoop and shake it well several times towards the
handle. Now, in this handle was a small trap or slit which
opened with a spring, as soon as the gold was shaken against
it, and by this means a pennyweight or two of gold could be
abstracted.
The following fraud practised in selling gold was told me
one evening in my tent by a man who was my own mate :


“ You know,” said he, “ old P., the storekeeper ? Well, now
I’ll tell you how I did the old boy once. I went into his store
one afternoon just before dark to sell some two or three
ounces of gold ; the old fellow, as you may remember, was
very short-sighted and slow in his movements; well, I
emptied the gold out of the bag into the scale, and while his
back was turned towards me I managed to slip a six-penny-
weight weight into the scale under the gold. He then weighed
it, and then told me how much he made it. I said, all right,
Mr. P., please give me the cash, for I’m in a great hurry. He
immediately handed me over the amount before taking the
gold out of the scale ; and I left the store, and you may be
sure did not show my face there again for some time. That
wasn't a bad dodge, was it ? Did the old boy nicely out of a
note.” I need hardly say I parted company with my honest
(?) mate as soon as I could find an excuse for doing so, but not
before he had played some of his tricks on me.
The landlady of an hotel, well-known for her kind and
generous disposition, being visited one day by a tribe of black
fellows and their lubras, took compassion on one of the young
women, whose only clothing consisted of an old blanket held
together by wooden pins. Pitying her unfortunate condition,
she ran into her room and brought out an old gown, which she
gave her. Immediately she received the garment with every
token of delight, she coolly began, before the landlady and
assembled diggers in the bar, to unpin the blanket, which she
let fall on the ground, and there stood in a state of nature, a
perfect model of an Australian Venus. The various effects of this
unlooked for exhibition on those present I need not describe.
A keeper of an hotel on the diggings, having a tree whose
branches overhung and endangered his house, made an engage-
ment with some black fellows to lop off some of the branches.
They agreed to do it, but demanded something to eat and drink
before they began, To this the landlord thoughtlessly agreed,
and finding that they still objected going to work, asked them
the reason. “Blackfellow no fool, no work when belly full.”
So the landlord had to wait until they again got hungry and
thirsty, before they would lop off a single branch.
At the commencement of the diggings, a digger was one day
puddling at his tub, when he was surrounded by a party of
blackfellows, who had evidently never before seen the operation
of gold-washing, and could not form the slightest idea as to


what the man was doing. Watching him attentively until he
shovelled the dirt out of his tub, rocked it through his cradle,
and then threw away the hopperings, they burst out into a
roar of laughter, one exclaimining—“ Well, white man one
great big fool, wash stones, and then throw them away.”
A reefer of the name of Faull, at present residing in the
district, had his attention drawn, through finding a speck of
gold, to some tailings near to where an old tent had stood, in
the neighbourhood of Wilson’s reef. He collected them to-
gether, picked up the floor of the tent, had the lot crushed,
and obtained upwards of 18 ounces of gold. He was greatly
laughed at and quizzed at the time for doing such work, but
few knew the result of his simple labours.

Tarrangower Times. —This local journal was established
March 9, 1858, by Messrs. Wright and Ralston. It was
originally published in an unpretending form of modest
dimensions. During the first quarter it was so extensively
patronised, that the proprietors were induced to increase it to
its present size, a full-sized demy sheet. At the beginning of
the year 1860, it passed into the hands of the present pro-
prietors, Messrs. Howliston, Tate and Co. It has been the
means, as many of the old residents can fully testify, of bene-


filing the district to a great extent, and as an up-country journal
ranks highly.
Churches and Chapels.
All denominations of Christians are well represented in the
district. The members of the Church of England have a sub-
stantial and commodious stone building, which is exceedingly
well attended since it has been under the ministration of the
Rev. C. Searle. The Wesleyan body have the honor of
being (as they usually are) the founders of the first place of
worship at Tarrangower. Their first chapel was a small
calico tent pitched under a tree, where some ten or a dozen
persons met on Sundays for the purpose of prayer. A tea-
party was proposed and got up, and with the proceeds they
erected a brick building. The number of their members
increasing, a substantial stone building was erected on Eagle
Hawk Flat; these two, however, not affording sufficient
accommodation, and the market-house having frequently to
be used on special occasions, a subscription was set on foot,
and the splendid chapel in Fountain-street was built and
recently opened. This building is by far the handsomest in
Maldon, in fact there are very few digging townships can
boast of so beautiful a place of worship. The Roman
Catholic Church is open for divine service every Sunday, but
there is no resident priest. The Presbyterians possess a neat
and commodious wooden building. The Baptists, Welsh
Independents and others, have also places of worship, all of
which are well attended.

German Club-house and Gymnasium , Eaglehawk. —President,
F. E. M. Courtin, Esq., J.P.; treasurer, Dr. Kupferburg; secre-
tary, Otto Praed.
Maldon Hospital, Chapel-street. —Architect, D. R. Drape ;
builders, Messrs. Hornsby and Brisco and T. Calder; presi-
dent, R. C. Mackenzie, Esq., P.M.; vice, F. E. M. Courtin, Esq.,
J.P. ; trustees, Messrs. J. Warnock, J.P., Hutton, Robinson,
Ormond, and Polsue; committee, Messrs. A. C. Seymour, D.
Hutton, F. Maddocks, R. Braddon, H. K. Grant, J.P, F. F.
Morris, and A. D. Ellis; treasurer, J. Ormond; honorary
secretary, H. J. Ellar; honorary medical officers, Drs. Kupfer-
burg and Pattinson; resident dispenser, Mr. L. C. Payne ;
matron, Mrs. Payne; collector, J. G. Moon. This building is
situated on a fine breezy hill, a short distance from the town-
ship. The first hospital erected was of wood (now the private
residence of the dispenser), and the first patient admitted was
Richard Kennedy, on August 31, 1859.* This building being
found too small, a Government grant w r as obtained, and funds
raised by subscription, amateur performances, concerts, &c.,
and a new brick edifice erected. The foundation stone w r as
* It is rather a singular fact, that Richard Kennedy was the first
man who purchased a ticket for the Hospital, and the first patient
admitted. He met with a severe accident, together with a man
named Boyd, from the sudden explosion of a blast in a claim on
Linscott’s Reef.


laid byR. C. Mackenzie, Esq., the warden (with masonic honors),
who was presented on the occasion with a handsome silver
trowel, bearing the following inscription : —“ Presented to R.
C. Mackenzie, Esq., P.M., and President of the Hospital, by
the Committee of Management, on the occasion of laying the
foundation stone of the Hospital, Maldon, June 25, 1860.”
There being no female ward, another wing was last year added,
together with bath-rooms, &c. As a proof of the interest
taken by the residents of Maldon for the welfare of this most
useful institution, at a fancy fair given last year in aid of the
funds, the handsome sum of nearly £7OO was realised. Every
possible attention is shown the patients by Mr. Payne, the
resident dispenser, and the medical gentlemen attending ; and
it is to be hoped that storekeepers, diggers, and others, will
continue to support so valuable an institution. The visiting
days are Sunday, Tuesday, and Friday, from two to five
o’clock p.m.
Rifle Corps. —Ever since the first initiation of the volunteer
movement in Victoria the stalwart men of Maldon have
evinced an earnest desire to participate therein. In conse-
quence of the Government having decided not to authorise or
subsidise any new corps in districts not immediately connected
with Melbourne by rail, the martial ardor was, for a time,
obliged to remain quiescent. Eventually, however, the
Maldonites consented (sooner than lose all chance of taking
part in the defence of the colony) to become, for the time
being, a contingent to the Castlemaine corps, under Lieutenant
Colonel Bull. An association was formed, and through the
kindness of the volunteer authorities in lending arms, and the
indefatigable exertions of Mr. R Page, of the Royal Hotel, as
an honorary drill instructor, the members of the association
became so efficient as to be gladly accepted by Lieutenant
Colonel Bull, as a company of the North-Western Battalion.
The company is at its full strength of 75, and there are many
supernumeraries willing and anxious to fill up the first
vacancies. The following is a list of the officers ; —Captain
C. Ogilvy; Subaltern, H. K. Grant; Sergeants, R. Page, J.
Tate, and J. M‘Farlane; Corporals, R. A. Poole, J. Anderson,
J. W. Wright, andH. Franklin; Hon. Secretary, H.Ellar.
Garrick Club. —President, R C. Mackenzie, Esq., P.M. ;
Vice-President, R. Braddon. This society of Dramatic
Amateurs has been established upwards of six years. Their


first performance took place at the Kangaroo Theatre, for the
benefit of the Castlemaine Hospital. Up to the present time
they have given twenty-eight representations, and have been
the means of enriching the funds of both Castlemaine and
Maldon hospitals, and also relieving the wants of private
individuals, who, by sickness or accident, have fallen into
distress. The receipts of these performances amount to nearly
<£looo. Recently two other clubs have been formed ; one the
Odd Fellows’ Dramatic Society, and the other an Opera
Company. The former have given two or three most suc-
cessful entertainments, but the Opera Company may be said
to have eclipsed all by the admirable manner in which they got
up and performed an original opera, written by T. C. Cooper,
Esq., J.P., with new music composed by Herr Gollmick.
This entertainment was given to aid the funds of the
Athenaeum, and drew such a crowded and enthusiastic audience
that a second performance was given, with equal success. It
is not too much to say, that the dramatic art, as represented
by the Maldon amateurs, is very far superior to that to be met
with in far larger townships in the colony. Maldon can also
boast of a Choral Society, conducted by Herr Gollmick, and
there are occasionally very attractive concerts given by the
scholars of Trinity Church School, under the leadership of
Mr. Johnson.
Cricket. —There are two clubs at present at Maldon : one,
the Maldon United Club—honorary secretary, W. Dearden ;
the other, the Nuggetty—honorary secretary, D. Chrystall.
The clubs have been established about seven years, and
number several expert players, but from want of united and
continuous practice they have not been always so successful
(excepting last season) as could be wished, but they have ever
deserved and secured the good opinion of all for their hospi-
tality. Their excellent and liberal caterer for some years past
has been Mr. E. Ellis, of the Kangaroo hotel, who has pur-
chased the right of the refreshment stand on the Maldon Oval.
The ground is in excellent condition for play, thanks to the
liberality of the lovers of this noble sport.
Mineral Spring. —Maldon possesses a fine mineral spring
on Eaglehawk, the water of which, according to the analysis
of that high authority, Professor M‘Coy, possesses exactly the
qualities of the Spa waters of Germany. This water has been
administered with beneficial effects in the Hospital, and doubt-


less such a spring in any part of Europe would be fully
appreciated, and would cause a second Bath or Harrogate to
rise in its vicinity. It is this water which is constantly sup-
plied, fresh and clear, to the baths.
Horticultural Society. —President, J. Warnock, Esq, J.P. ;
honorary secretary, A. D. Ellis. This society, which has only
been recently established, held its first show in the Market -
house on the sth December, and, taking all things into consi-
deration, was a great success, and promises well for the future.
Royal Oaks. —In commemoration of the marriage of the
Prince of Wales, two young oaks, the produce of acorns picked
up in Windsor Park by Mr. A. Aldridge, and presented by
that gentleman to the town, were planted by Mesdames War-
nock and Mackenzie in the Borough Reserve. The oaks,
which are thriving vigorously, received the names of Alexandra
and Albert Edward.
Bands. —Within the present year two bands were established,
one brass, the other fife and drum. The . brass band,
under the able superintendence of Mr. Richard Cowling, con-
sisted of sixteen members, who have on several occasions given
a taste of their quality by the able manner they already per-
form some very attractive pieces of music. It is to be hoped,
during the summer months, that they will hold weekly con-
certs in the market-house similar to those given in Castlemaine.
Mr. Cowling having recently left the district, the band is now
under the leadership of Mr. Burrows. The fife and drum
band have become incorporated with the Rifle Corps, and will
doubtless be the means of adding, by its musical attraction,
many to its ranks.
The Race Course. —Situated about two miles from the town-
ship, near to Porcupine Plat. Races are held regularly every-
year during the months of December or January. They
were much better attended formerly than they are at present,
and the sport at the last meeting was very indifferent. Mr.
Poole, of the Brighton Hotel, usually caters for the public,
and always gives satisfaction.
Conveyances. —There are two coaches running between the
Township and Castlemaine every morning at 9 o’clock a.m.,
returning from the Railway Station at about 3 p.m. Both
receive a liberal share of patronage, as their owners, who are
the drivers, are old residents and much respected. The mail
from Maryborough passes through every afternoon for Castle-


maine, at half-past five, leaving Castlemaine for Maryborough
at about eleven. There are also conveyances (Green’s and Cop-
ley’s) running between the Township and Eaglehawk.
Five Brigade, Alaldon possesses both a Fire Engine and
Brigade, but, fortunately, their services are seldom required.
Reservoir,— For domestic and mining purposes, is capable of
containing nine million gallons of water.
Tarrangower Bathing Company.— Baths, Eaglehawk. Board
of Management—Chairman, F. E. M. Courtin, Esq., J.P. ;
Committee, Messrs. Morris, Ellar, A. C. Seymour, and Dn
Kupferberg. These baths are exceedingly well patronised
during the summer season.
Cemetery. —Trustees Gazetted 7th day of January, 1861,
contained in Gazette of 15th January, 1861, p. 82. Trustees,
R. C. Mackenzie, Esq., P.M., F. E. M. Courtin, Esq., J.P.,
James Warnock, Esq., J.P,, Henry Barclay, David Watt, John
Gallagher, Hugh Smith, and W. Falla Smith. The cemetery
is situated about half a mile from the Springs, on the road to
Nuggetty. At present four acres are enclosed, but the Govern-
ment Grant to the trustees comprises 20 acres. Previous to
its being fenced in, and having a resident sexton, persons were
allowed to dig graves where they chose ; the consequence of
which is that graves are scattered about in all directions, and
without the slightest regard to regularity. Rough stone and
bush fences w r ere also erected which greatly disfigured the
general appearance of the place. Since, however, it has been
in the hands of the trustees, and they have received the usual
Government Grant, no grave is allowed to be dug before the
payment of the usual fees, and permission given, excepting in
cases of destitution. The ground is also being laid out in walks
and sections, the old stone and bush fences removed, and the
graves made up and put in order.
One of the chief things which marks Tarrangower as a
diggings of early date are the number of graves scattered about
on hills and in gullies. In Fountain-street are the remains of
rather an extensive burial place, and many of the present
inhabitants have built their dwellings over or in close proximity
to the last home of former residents. But the most romantic
and beautiful spot of this description is situated on a hill,
above the Springs Hotel; there are two or three graves shaded
by evergreen wattle trees, and there repose in peace the bodies
of some of the original pioneers of this gold-field.
