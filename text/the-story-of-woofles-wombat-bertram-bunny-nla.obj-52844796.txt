THE STORY OF
WOOFLES WOMBAT
&
BERTRAM BUNNY


The Story of Woofles Wombat
and Bertram Bunny
W/’OOFLES was a young
wombat, who lived in a
little house he had dug for him-
self, in a bank at the side of
the road.
A little further down the
road, lived Bertram Bunny, in a
little house that he had dug for
himself.
Woofles was really a very
nice young wombat, but his
mother had always taught him
to keep himself to himself. So
when he went for a walk of an
evening, and saw Bertram also
going for a walk, he pretended
not to notice him. Because after
all, Bertram WAS only a rabbit,
and you never know, with
strangers.
As for Bertram Bunny, he
used to giggle at Woofles be-
hind his back, but really, he
would have loved to have been
friends.




One fine evening, when Woofles was
strolling along, humming a little song, whom
should he see but Mr. Dingo. What was
worse, Mr. Dingo saw him!
“Ah ha!” said Mr. Dingo, licking
his lips, “There’s nothing I like bet-
ter for my supper, than a nice fat
young wombat!”
Poor Woofles turned and ran for
his life, but it was no good. His
short fat little legs would not go fast
enough, and in one bound, Mr.
Dingo had caught up with him.
“Not so fast, not so fast,”
chuckled Mr. Dingo, “You’re
coming home with me.” And he
opened his great big mouth, and
showed all his sharp teeth.


Just at that moment, Bertram Bunny
peeped out from behind a tree.
“Yah!” squeaked Bertram. “Silly
old Dingo. Dingo can’t catch me.”
“I’ll eat this wombat, and catch you
too ” growled Mr. Dingo.
“He he he! You can’t catch me.
Just try” giggled Bertram. And he
ran right underneath Mr.
Dingo, and tickled his tummy
with his ears.
“Alright, I WILL catch you
and eat you too,” shouted Mr.
Dingo. And forgetting all
about Woofles, he ran after
Bertram as hard as he could.
But Bertram was a very good
runner (he had won first prize
in the school sports), and in no
time, he had left Mr. Dingo far
behind.






And Bertram would say, "Yes,
but we could do with a drop of
• »»
ram.
Then Woofles would go home,
and think, “I’d like to ask him in to
tea, but I don’t suppose he’d come.”
And Bertram would walk slowly
along, thinking, "That Wombat is a
stuck up chap.”
Meanwhile, Woofles hurried
home as fast as he could.
"Well, Bertram Bunny is
very brave, anyway,” he said to
himself, as he made a cup of tea.
After that, whenever Woofles
met Bertram, he would bow polite-
ly, and say, "Good evening, fine
weather we’re having.”


When winter came, Woofles caught
a bad cold, and it was too wet for him
to go for walks.
One night, he had looked at all
his picture books, and he was feeling
very lonely. Suddenly, he heard a
loud knock at the door, and a voice
called, “Let me in!”
Quickly Woofles opened the door,
and in tumbled Bertram Bunny. But
before Woofles could shut the door again, Mr. Dingo had pushed
his way in too I
“Now I’ve got you both,” he snarled.
“Quickly, down this little passage,” cried Woofles.
“I’ll soon get you out of there,” said Mr. Dingo, as he put his
head in the passage after them.
Woofles waited until Mr. Dingo’s head was right over him, then




he bucked as hard as he could. BANG - went Mr. Dingo’s head
against the low roof of the passage.
Well that was the end of Mr. Dingo. He was only too glad
to get outside and go home.
As for Bertram and Woofles, they sat down together, and had
cocoa and hot buttered toast. And Woofles was never lonely again,
because Bertram came to live with him.
