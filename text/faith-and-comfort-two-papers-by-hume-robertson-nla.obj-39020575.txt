FOREWORD
By
The Countess of Darnley
This little book, which Captain
Hume Robertson is sending out
with a deep and reverent desire
to bring comfort to the sad and
bereaved, carries a far wider signi-
ficance.
It seems to be a closing down of
the old idea of morbidity about
death, and opening wide the door
of wider vision, which surely the
days of suffering and anguish call
aloud for to-day. The gates of


death are now never closed—the
souls of hundreds of thousands are
passing over to the Other Side,
daily, hourly; and although our
finite vision is limited, yet we may
rest assured the spiritual side of
death, or, more correctly speaking,
the new-born life of the spirit of
the departed, becomes a more real-
istic mystery, if one may use the
term, an awakening of our senses
to the comfort and conviction of
the words of our Saviour in John
xiv., verses 1 and 2.
If we had an absolute belief in
our religion we could never doubt
the fact of life after death, nor
could we grieve as “those who
6


have no hope” for those who cross
to the Other Side of life.
The Spring comes year by year
—the resurrection of nature; the
trees put on their leaves, the bulbs,
heralded by the snowdrop, come to
perfection—a parable sung of our
own resurrection from the dead.
Yet within the soul of all, even
the doubter and unbeliever, is the
yearning for a wider life, a longing
for a deeper knowledge than the
life here can give.
The imperfect has to be made
perfect in our natures, and in all
branches of art and science; and
the shortness of the span of man’s
Foreword


life gives not the time needed—so
we look to Eternity for the solution,
and we “lay up our treasures where
moth and rust do not corrupt.”
Let us take to our comfort
this effort, then, of Captain Hume
Robertson to direct our loving,
longing eyes to the Beyond, resting
assured that
“God nothing does, nor suffers aught
to be —
But what thou wouldst, if thou couldst
see the end as He. ,,

FOREWORD
By
Rev. Archibald Fleming, D.D.
Captain Hume Robertson asks
me to write a foreword to this
little book. To the Australian
Forces, this heroic and beloved
chaplain, who has dared and suf-
fered so much with them and
for them, needs no introduction;
he is already at home in their
hearts. And he will quickly be
held in a like affection and in-
timacy by those who read this
modest, singularly endearing broch


ure on the subject of so-called
Death and Immortality. So doing,
he will indefinitely widen the
circle of those who are in his
debt. For there are casualties of
the broken heart as well as of the
lacerated body. These too cry out,
in their pain and helplessness, for
First Aid; and Padre Robertson,
with an infinite tenderness and the
skill of a heart’s physician, brings
it. The cruel wound of the battle-
field may go on to canker and death
if it is not skilfully and quickly
cleansed and bound from the first;
on the other hand, given such care,
it passes to healing, convalescence,
and health. It is so with the
Faith and Comfort


wounded soul. The news of bereave-
ment hurts cruelly; it mangles; it
crushes. And at once there is the
septic risk—the risk of embittered
outlook, despair, rebellion; the risk
of moral festering and soul fever
—if the Good Physician, or one
who speaks for Him, and with His
accent, and employs His gentle
touch, be not quickly by. But, when
and where he comes—speaking the
right word, applying the right balm,
telling the old, high legend of con-
quered death, and of life and immor-
tality brought to light-—then and
there, slowly but surely, the wound
heals healthily, the dazed soul sees
steadily once more, and faces life
Foreword


believingly again; and in due season
this one-time “casualty” is back in
the fighting line—doing and daring
all in patience for Duty, Righteous-
ness, and God. It all depends on
being in time; and therein lies the
virtue of Padre Robertson’s “First
Aid.” God bless him in the bring-
ing of it to the multitude who need
it in these devastating days!

I.
Faith
The war is testing us. We are
being tried as with fire. There
have been days when all things
seemed rushing into the dark;
happy are those who know that
“the dark still is God.” The war
tests the faith of the individual.
Some have already lost faith. The
cruelty of the war or the loss of
one they held most dear has em-
bittered their souls. Doubtless,


when the people of Judea, the race
chosen of God, were utterly broken
by Babylon; when God’s Holy
Temple, their pride and glory, was
profaned and laid in ruins; when
those who survived the destruction
of Jerusalem were carried away
captive into Babylon, it appeared to
them either that Jehovah was in-
ferior to the gods of their con-
querors, or that He had cast them
off and was untrue to His promises.
Time showed that God had His
wise purposes, and that the suffer-
ing of the Jews was necessary for
the preservation of the nation’s
faith, and that it should continue
to be the medium of the progressive
Faith and Comfort


Revelation of God. God has used
our nation in a wonderful way for
the spread of the Gospel, in the
cause of justice and liberty, and for
the advance of civilisation. We
believe He still has in the future
great duties and tasks for us in
relation to the coming of the King-
dom of Jesus Christ; but for these
duties and tasks we must be made
fit. This war is the beginning of
the acceleration of the coming
of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ.
Heavenly watchers hear the tramp
of the Hosts of the Lord; they see
the gleam of the silken banners of
the triumphant King; they hail the
dawn of the glad day when right-
Faith


eousness shall cover the earth as the
waters cover the face of the deep.
Those who have laid down their
lives in this great struggle against
one enemy of the Kingdom, mili-
tarism, know the Kingdom iscoming.
How happy are they that they have
been permitted to serve! Gladly
they watch the war burning up false
ideals of life, loosening the fetters
of social superstitions, and deepen-
ing the realisation of human brother-
hood. They rejoice to see men and
women who before lived selfishly
giving themselves to selfless service.
We above all generations are com-
passed about with a great cloud
of witnesses.
Faith and Comfort


To be content to suffer and see
others suffer, to lose what is dearer
than life, for Christ’s sake and the
Gospel’s—for the coming of the
Kingdom—!!!- will our faith stand
the test ? or is our religion a name
and our daily prayer, “Thy Kingdom
come,” a mere word? Should we
have prayed, “ ‘Thy Kingdom come,’
but not if I am to suffer; Thy will
be done/ provided that my ideas of
what is necessary for my nation
and for humanity be not outraged’ ”?
But you say, “If only I knew that
this was the beginning of the end
of the coming of Christ’s Kingdom,
I should be content; that such
abomination and desolation should
Faith


be let loose upon the world is too
terrible.”
There are terrible evils in the
world, and terrible must be the
remedy. We have prayed, “Thy
Kingdom come.” “By terrible things
in righteousness wilt Thou answer
us, O God of our salvation.” God
knows, and He will work. We
must believe. It is the testing time
of our faith. Jesus warns us that
His coming is to be accompanied
by terrible things. Each new up-
rush of the Kingdom throughout
the past centuries was marked by
te rible things. The early persecu-
tions of Rome, the sack of Rome
by the Goths, the taking of Con-
Faith and Comfort


stantinople, the Reformation—all
these great epochs in the history
of the Kingdom were fraught with
sacrifice and suffering. There is
no progress save through sacrifice.
The Cross of Christ is its symbol,
and the Kingdom comes through
the Cross. The call to-day is for
Faith—a Faith that spurs endeavour,
a Faith that refuses to be moved,
a Faith that looks up to God as
the Supreme Ruler of the Universe
and humbly awaits His will. The
Kingdom comes; then watch and
work for its coming; and to work
is also to pray.

“Let not your heart be troubled;
ye believe in God, believe also in me.
“In my Father’s house are many
mansions; if it were not so, I would
have told you; for I go to prepare a
place for you. And if Igo and pre-
pare a place for you, I come again,
and will receive you unto myself;
that where I am there ye may be
also.”
“Whosoever liveth and believeth
in me shall never die.”
“Come, ye blessed of my Father,
inherit the kingdom prepared for
you from the foundation of the
world.”


“For me to live is Christ, and to
die is gain.”
“But I am in a strait betwixt the
two, having the desire to depart and
be with Christ: for it is very far
better.”
“And I heard a voice from heaven,
saying unto me, Write, Blessed are
the dead which die in the Lord from
henceforth; yea, saith the Spirit, that
they may rest from their labours; for
their works follow with them.”
“And his servants shall do him
service: and they shall see his face;
and his name shall be on their fore-
heads. And there shall be night no
more; and they need no light of lamp,
neither light of sun; for the Lord
God shall give them light; and they
shall reign for ever and ever.”
Comfort


“There is nc Death! What seems so is
transition.
This life of mortal breath
Is but the suburb of the life Elysian,
Whose portal we call Death/'
“It is not death to die,
To leave this weary road,
And 'midst the brotherhood on high
To be at home with God.
It is not death to bear
The wrench that sets us free
From dungeon chain, to breathe the air
Of boundless liberty.
It is not death to fling
Aside this sinful dust,
And rise on strong, exulting wing,
To live among the just.”
When the early Christians buried
their dead they dressed themselves
f
in white and rejoiced that their
loved ones were with the Lord and
Master. They believed the words of
Faith and Comfort


St. Paul that it was very far better
to depart and to be with Christ.
Our ideas of death are influenced
by the mournful character of our
burial ceremonies and by the diffi-
culty we experience in disassociating
the personality and the body through
which it manifests itself. The hearse
with nodding plumes, the black
garments, all the accompaniments of
a funeral, add to its natural sadness.
Some of the words of an ordinary
burial service give the impression
that the body is the person and
that the person remains in the
grave until the resurrection morning.
Little children are frequently led
into a room where a corpse lies in
Comfort


the strange stillness of death; they
kiss for the last time the cold face
of what they believe is the one they
loved so dearly, who is to be put
into a hole in the ground. Can we
wonder that the average child grows
up with a morbid, haunting, and
quite un-Christian fear of death?
It is only by a continual and
insistent training of our minds and
imaginations that the effect of early
impressions can be counteracted,
and we are able to realise that the
body is not the person, and that
“I” does not mean the body in
which we live, but the immortal
spirit.
Faith and Comfort


We do not bury people; we bury
their cast-off bodies. Cemeteries
are not “sleeping places” where the
dead lie. Graves do not hold those
we love. A grave is sacred to us
because it contains what once en-
shrined a human soul, but for the
departed it has no interest and no
association. In our natural desire
to keep alive the memory of one
who has left us we erect monuments
which in the course of years we
seldom see. The memory of the
departed is poorly enhanced by
such monuments, however costly.
The money thus sunk is a national
waste, being unproductive: if it had
been used in endowing a bed in a
Comfort


hospital or increasing the capital
funds of some charitable institution
or missionary society, it would not
only be a memorial in perpetuity
but also in benefaction.
The Parsees are more Christian
in this respect. They erect no such
monuments, but every year on the
anniversary of the death the family
meet and in memory of the deceased
give to some charitable object. I
feel confident that those who fell
on the fields of Flanders or else-
where in the wide area of our
military operations would much
rather that the loving tribute to
the memory of their heroism should
take the form of succour to the
Faith and Comfort


living than a gravestone, which in
a comparatively few years will fall
into disrepair. The simple cross
with its ineffaceable inscription that
the War Office provides sufficiently
marks each grave, in ground truly
consecrated by the sublime sacrifice
of the fallen.
If we would realise that we do
not bury our dear ones, we should
never think of them as lying in a
far-away, in, it may be, an unknown
grave, or even in one of our be-
wildering stone - studded burial-
grounds. They are not there, but,
freed from the restrictions of this
material world, they delight in a
freedom, gladness, and glory of
Comfort


those who know that to depart
and be with Christ is very far better.
Their lot is very far better than the
fulfilment of worldly hopes and
desires, far better than the tender
affections and sweet joys of an
earthly home; and how much
far better than the temptations,
struggles, and uncertainties of the
present life, than the field of war
and all that it entails!
The blessed nature of the life
enjoyed by those who pass to the
presence of Christ is described in
Scripture in rich Eastern imagery.
Ideas of the spiritual realm can
only be conveyed to us, and that
Faith and Comfort


imperfectly, in terms of things with
which we are familiar. We must
content ourselves with the promise
of Jesus that where He is there
shall we be also. Our sorrow for
ourselves on account of our loss
should be more than assuaged by
the knowledge that they are with
our Lord and Saviour.
Death is God's messenger sent
to summon us to the heavenly
banqueting - house—or it may be
said to be the door through which
we pass from comparative darkness
into the eternal light, from the
mystery of this life into the fuller
knowledge of God’s loving purposes.
It matters little to those who pass
Comfort


if God’s messenger comes sudden
and swift, and the summons be by
bullet or shell —better so than a
long term of suffering and weak-
ness.
Yet if this is God’s plan for
some of us. He has His gracious
purpose. Life’s school has hard
lessons. There are those whose
future sphere of work in the spirit-
ual realm is such that they must
be prepared by pain and suffering,
just as gold is refined by fire, or
steel that is to be fashioned into
a pen or some other instrument for
special work is sorely tried before
it is ready for its high purpose.
Faith and Comfort


Many of our brightest and best
in the high promise of youth have
been summoned by God because
He has need of them.
It is not for us to speak as if
they had been too early removed
from this earthly life; they have
entered upon a more gracious and
blessed fulfilment of bright promise
than that held in a long tale of
earthly years.
Those who have died for the
Kingdom on the field of battle have
been called to follow the footsteps
of Him who died for us all, that
whether we wake (live here) or
sleep (pass beyond) we should live
together with Him.
Comfort


Thrice blessed they, forgetting self,
Who gladly take the cross,
Symbol of death for life, of life through
death.
And enter life crowned with immortal
asphodels.
For them though weep we may—
For did not Jesus weep?—
We will rejoice and smiling say,
“ Thanks be to God that they thus

At a Church Assembly sym-
pathetic reference had been made
to the sad loss sustained by a
member of the court, a celebrated

the call of the Empire, had gone

“Where your treasure is, there

Rutherford (1600-1661), famous for
his wonderful letters, to the Lady
Earlstoun wrote: “Let your children
be as so many flowers borrowed
from God. If the flowers die or
wither, thank God for a summer
loan of them, and keep good neigh-
bourhood to borrow and lend with
Him. Set your heart upon heaven,
and trouble not your spirit with this
clay-idol of the world, which is but

vanity and hath but the lustre of the
rainbow in the air which cometh
and goeth with a flying March
shower.” In a letter to the Lady
Gaitgirth he said: “Take no heavier
lift of your children than your Lord
alloweth. Give them room beside
your heart, but not in the yolk of
your heart where Christ should be:
for then they are your idols, not
your bairns. If your Lord take
any of them home to His House
before the storm come on, take it
well ; the owner of the orchard
may take down two or three apples
off his own trees before midsummer
and ere they get the harvest sun,
and it would not be seemly that
Faith and Comfort


His servant, the gardener, should
chide Him for it. Let our Lord
pluck His own fruit in any season
He pleaseth: they are not lost to
you, they are laid up as well, as
that they are coffered in heaven
where our Lord’s best jewels lie.”
In a letter to Mrs. Hume, Ruth-
erford speaks of the death of her
husband: “I know that the disput-
ing of your thoughts against his
going thither, the way and manner
of his death, the instruments, the
place, the time, will not ease your
spirits except ye rise higher than
second causes and be silent because
the Lord hath done it; if we
measure the goings of the Almighty
Comfort


and His ways, the bottom whereof
we see not, we quite mistake God.
He is far above our ebb and narrow
thoughts. There hath been too
little of your love and heart in
heaven. And believe it, it is in-
comprehensible love that Christ
saith, Tf I enjoy the glory of my
Father and the Crown of Heaven
far above men and angels, I must
use all means though ever so
violent to have the company of
such a one for ever and ever/ ”
Never as to-day should such words
be proclaimed upon the house-tops,
never more than in this present
time do we need to have our
affections drawn Heavenwards.

Harry Lauder in the March Strand
Magazine writes: “ When the
Germans killed my only son,
Captain John Lauder, on 20th
December, 1915, they killed every
spark of ambition, every hope for
the future, that was burning within
my breast. It was for my boy, my
son John,that I had worked, travell-
ing thousands and thousands of
miles. My son John was more to
me than anything else in the wide
world. From the day he was born
until the day of his death he was
my one pride and my one joy
.... As he grew up I spent my
happiest moments with him. . . .
We were more like two friends
Comfort


than like father and son, and to
have spared his life I would gladly
have taken his place on the battle
field. ... It was on New Year's
Day of 1916 that the news came
to us of John’s death at the front.
.... I heard a terrible cry from
the front of the house. I was
stunned for a moment, then my
head began to swim because of
the awful fear that clutched at my
heart. No! No! No! I said to
myself, God wouldn’t be so cruel.
He simply couldn’t take my boy.
But when I saw my wife’s face I
knew. . . . For days I burned my
brain with sickening and despairing
thoughts, and asked of what use
Faith and Comfort


indeed were all my labours, all my
toil, during all these years. At
times the raging agony at the
realisation of my loss was almost
too much. At times, too, during
those first days, I almost ques-
tioned the justice and wisdom of a
God who would allow such a thing
to happen. And then, one day, it
suddenly came to me as if in a
revelation that I had not made use
of something in which I had always
believed. ... While the pain and
grief had been blinding my eyes,
God had been waiting patiently
for the first sharp agony to pass
away, and when it did He gently
lifted the veil from my eyes and
Comfort


showed me the promised land be-
yond. I mean that suddenly I
realised that I had not seen the
last of John, and that we were
sure to meet in another world.
Oh, that I could convey to you the
healing balm that that thought
was to my soul! I would that I
could picture the joy of the thought
that I was to see my John again
at some future date, just as if he
had simply been on a long journey
and was waiting for his mother
and me to come to him.
“And that is what every father
and mother who loses a son must
do—have strong, unbreakable faith
in the future life, in the world
Faith and Comfort


beyond, where you will see your
son once again. Do not give way
to grief, as I did. Instead, keep
your gaze and your faith firmly
fixed on the world beyond, and
regard your boy’s absence as though
he were but on a long journey.
By keeping your faith you will help
to win this war. For if you lose
it, the war and your own personal
self are lost.”
Many, like Harry Lauder, have
found that comfort comes not in
remembrance of dear departed days
or in the recollection of the sweet
love we prized, but in the knowledge
that those days still are ours and
are to be again, that love lives
Comfort


on unchanged, as true and as
tender. Instead of repining at our
temporary loss, should not we
rather praise God that He blessed
our lives with such love, even
although He had so soon to
summon His dear gift back to
His Treasure-house ?
“If thou shouldst call me to resign
What most I prize, it ne’er was mine;
I only yield Thee what is Thine;
'Thy will be done/”
What I have written I have
written out of deep sympathy, with
a desire to comfort those whose
hearts have been pierced as with
a sword. Yet true consolation
comes from the ministrations of
the Holy Spirit of God. Our
Faith and Comfort


Heavenly Father has all tenderness
for His children. The Lord Jesus,
although throned in glory, knows
our human weakness and sorrow,
and the Holy Spirit is to take of
the things of Jesus and show them
unto us. It is His blessed office
to assure us of the love of the
gentle, sympathising Saviour. He
who died for us upon the Cross
would win us to Himself. His love
is a seeking and saving love, the love
of One who, having suffered himself,
has perfect sympathy. He knows we
cannot understand: He asks us to
trust His love. He says to us, as
He said to St. Peter: “What I do
thou knowest not now, but thou
Comfort


shalt know hereafter.” Open your
heart to His dear love, and to you
will be revealed a secret of the
Lord, namely, that in loving, Christ-
like sympathy with and helpful,
selfless service for others who, like
you, have suffered and sorrowed,
you will find an anodyne for your
poor wounded heart, a glad sur-
cease for your troubled soul.
Work for the Kingdom, and you
will not doubt its coming. Show
something of the love of the Lord
Jesus to others, and you will know
comfort of his love for you.

FLOWER OF YOUTH
LEST Heaven be thronged with grey-beards
hoary,
God, who made boys for His delight,
Stoops in a day of grief and glory
And calls them in, in from the night.

Our skies have many a new gold star.

faces,
New-waked from dreams of dreadful things
They walk in green and pleasant places
And by the crystal water-springs
Who dreamt of dying and the slain.
And the fierce thirst and the strong pain.
Dear boys! They shall be young for ever.
The Son of God was once a boy.
They run and leap by a clear river
And of their youth they have great joy.
God who made boys so clean and good
Smiles with the eyes of fatherhood.

Now Heaven is by the young invaded;
Their laughter’s in the House of God.
Stainless and simple as he made it
God keeps the heart o’ the boy unflawed.
The old wise Saints look on and smile.
They arc so young and without guile.

Oh, if the sonless mothers weeping,
And widowed girls could look inside
The glory that hath them in keeping
Who went to the Great War and died,
They would rise and put their mourning off,
And say: ‘Thank God, he has enough !”

OBIT. 8TH DECEMBER, 1921.




THE CHURCH’S FAREWELL
TO HUME ROBERTSON.
We buried Hume Robertson last Friday;
but the spirit of the man is not buried. No
minister of our Church was ever more be*
loved. We never saw so many ministers at
a brother minister’s funeral. There were not
less than sixty, and there may have been
more. The majority, of course, were Pres-
byterian ministers, but every Protestant de-
nomination in Brighton was represented.
But if ministers loved him, his people adored
him. The record of his long absences through
war service and sickness is also a record of
loyalty on his people’s part of loyalty and
love to the end. At the funeral service the
Church was decorated with a profusion of
flowers, while wreaths were there in such
abundance that the suggestion of an im-
pcrishably fragrant influence was irresistible.
The Moderator presided. The Rev. Hugh
Kelly (minister in charge) and the Rev. John


Sinclair led the congregation in prayers.
These tenderly and lovingly expressed our
mingled thoughts of thankfulness for a
beautiful life, and sorrow for a separation
that means for us so much of loss and grief.
The Rev. Hugh Jones (Moderator of Pres-
bytery) read St. Paul’s greatest words of
consolation, and the climax of a never-to-be-
forgotten service was Mr, Murdoch’s address.
This splendid tribute of Hume Robertson’s
friend and comrade touched all hearts, and
we are pleased to be able to reproduce it
herewith.
Hume Robertson lies near the entrance
at the Brighton Cemetery.
The service was short and of Presbyterian
simplicity. Through it all there was the
same proud grief and glad confidence-grief
for our loss, confidence that our friend has
passed to some grander adventure, some
nearer fellowship with Jesus. He has solved
pain's problem. We wait and pray and
work. For him It is very far better.


HUME ROBERTSON.
(By the Rev. P. J. Murdoch, M.A.)
This man, whose death we mourn to-day,
whose release from pain we rejoice in, was
a man very greatly beloved—so deeply be-
loved that any attempt to sketch his character
must disappoint his friends. Yet some such
attempt I must make, and I ask your pardon
for its inadequacy.
Hume Robertson had a genius for friend-
ship. He made friends wherever he went,
and he retained them. He retained them
by maintaining friendly intercourse and doing
friendly acts. He took a great deal of trouble
to do that. And he took trouble because of
his friendly spirit. Friendliness was an innate
disposition. He was very keen about his
work; very keen about his games; bat
throughout work and game the human
interest persisted —the friendly hand was
feeling for the hand of a friend. And this


friendliness was thoroughly catholic. Men
of his own profession and men outside of it,
lawyers, doctors, soldiers, wise men and
foolish men, women as well as men —all
were grist to his mill. All were embraced by
his goodwill, and all felt his spell. And so it
comes about that there are few men in our
community whose death would be felt by so
many to be a personal loss. We deeply mourn
the loss of the community, and the loss of
the Church; but for all of us and for a
multitude of others there is something more
intimate. We are experiencing a personal
bereavement.
I think I am right in making this genius
for friendship the central characteristic of
Hume Robertson; but there were other
characteristics —characteristics that made his
friendship immensely valuable. One of these
was the gallant spirit he bore. We saw that,
of course, when, at an age that would have
made it impossible for most men, he volun-
teered as a Chaplain, went through years
of service with the colours, and suffered
grievous wounding. We saw it, too, in
connection with his last illness. But there


was more than that. He bore this spirit
throughout life. He faced life and the world
and death ‘‘breast and back as either should
be.” He was, indeed, something of an
adventurer. That was one reason why he
was so keen a traveller. But it was not in
travelling only that the spirit appeared. All
life was for him an adventure, and he loved
that aspect of it.
Then, he was richly gifted with humour.
That was a constant delight to his friends
and to himself. It brightened many weary
times and relieved pain. It did far more
than that. It enabled him to see men and
things in the proportion of their importance.
It saved him from reckoning himself or other
men bigger than they were. He could see
them in the perspective of history.
Along with these characteristics we should
mention his untiring industry. As I have said,
he knew well that he was not one of the
biggest men in the world. He was quite safe
from any foolish vanity of that kind. But
he knew equally well that there were some
things he could do and some things he was
set to do. And these things he would do
at whatever cost of toil. No man in our


Church was keener to do the work that
had been given him to do.
Another thing that helped him immensely
in his work and in his friendships was the
naturalness of his goodness. No one who
knew him well could doubt that he was
animated by the Spirit of Christ. A deep
religious conviction and religious purpose
were the supreme realities of his life. Every-
thing was touched by that Divine influence.
It sent him into the Ministry of the Gospel;
it shaped and inspired all his work; and had
power over all his intercourse. Yet he did not
speak much about religion to his friends,
He never put on religion like a garment. It
was an innermost power, working out from
the depths of his character, where it had its
throne. The Spirit of God, so far as it
was given to him, was incarnated, that is
it was wrought into the manhood of Hume
Robertson.
All this, then, and much more, he brought
to friendship, and all this he gave to Christ.
The characteristics I have referred to appear
in his public work. He was, perhaps, more
conscientious than interested in the routine


of Church courts; but he did his share
of it faithfully. In large questions of
ecclesiastical policy he was keenly interested,
and his counsel was always worthy of close
attention. He brought to every problem an
able and thoroughly independent mind —a
mind very well informed and trained to see
things in their proportions. It was, I think,
the social aspects of the Church’s work that
engaged his mind most deeply. If there was
any way in which the Church could guide
the community clear of social perils, he was
sure to recognise the opportunity and lead
the Church along that path. His interest
in men and women ruled his ecclesiastical
efforts.
Of Mr. Robertson’s work in the congre-
gations over which he had charge, you know
much more than I, Nevertheless, Ido know
something. I was sent up by my Presbytery
to Castlemaine to prosecute the call of
Brighton Beach, and I saw the deep love
his people there bore for him, and their
great unwillingness to lose his services. And
then I have been familiar with the long
story of your devotion to him. Here, then,
are two congregations that have loved him


with a quite extraordinary affection. A great
deal can be inferred from that. lam sure
you ail recognised that he did his very
best for you. And you knew that his best
was far better than most men could do. I
am sure that his wide reading made his
sermons interesting. lam sure that he was
diligent in visiting, especially in visiting the
sick and the lonely. And you found that
he gave his mind efficiently to congregational
problems. But there was something beyond
all that. I think I shall be right if I speak
again of his genius for friendship. Here
was a man who was sure of the Gospel
of God's love, and lived by it, and who
was constantly offering it to you through
the medium of friendship. His genuine
goodwill was manifest. He was your
friend, and he gave himself in his
friendship. He would work with you, talk
with you, laugh with you, play with you,
and in it all he was a frank, interesting,
gallant man; but he was always something
more, and had more to give. His friendship
embraced Jesus Christ, and the biggest thing
he had to give, and always wished to give,
was the key to the door of that higher
friendship.


Hume Robertson’s earthly history is ended;
but we are sure his life goes on. He rests;
and we are glad of that. But rest cannot
be all for such a spirit. With rest in his
heart, he will surely have some high adventure
to pursue. And he will be compassed with
friends, and, above all will penetrate ever
deeper into the supreme friendship. We leave
him quite confidently in that guardianship.
