Towns and Dwellings.
The Colony of Fiji comprises ail islands, rocks, and
reefs lying between latitudes 15° and 22° S., and between
longitudes 177° W. and 175° E. It lies about 1,800
miles to north-east of Sydney and 1,200 north of Auck-
land. The Tongan, or Friendly, Islands lie 180 miles
to its south-east, and Samoa, 500 miles to its north-
east, while the French colony of New Caledonia lies
about 700 miles to its west. The number of islands
forming the Colony has been variously stated at from
200 to 500, but this number includes uninhabited rocks
and islets, and only about 80 in all are inhabited.
, rlie Dependency of Rotuma, which forms a portion of
this Colony, consists of all the islands, rocks, and reefs
that lie between latitudes 12° and 15° S., and between
longitudes 175° and 180° E.
The total area of the Colony, including Rotuma, is
7,435 square miles.
* In this Report, Fijian words and proper names are spelt
phonetically As, in some cases, they would be spelt somewhat
differently if written by a Fijian, a table of these words is given on
page 58, showing both the phonetic and Fijian methods of spelling,

A


The more important islands of Fiji are hilly, even
mountainous, rising more or less abruptly, from the
shore, to a height of 4,000 or even 4,500 feet. The
hills are mostly composed of old volcanic lavas. On
the south-eastern side the islands are covered with
dense forests. The lower lands are more lightly
timbered, and apparently have, at a not very distant period,
all been under cultivation. The soil is almost everywhere
deep, easily worked, and especially rich in humic acid.
The northern and north-western sides of the larger
islands are characterised by comparative absence of forest
lands. The hills and plains are covered with long reeds,
or grass, and are dotted with clumps of Casuarina and
Pandanus trees.
The formation of the group appears to be both
volcanic and coral. At the present time, however,
there are no active volcanoes, although extinct craters
are numerous, and are found in Kandavu, the Ping
Grold Islands, and elsewhere. No traces of recent
volcanic outbursts are to be found, nor any streams of
lava or solfaras, though hot springs exist in Yiti Levu,
Yanua Levu, Ngau, and Kandavu. In nearly all the
islands the decomposed volcanic rocks have formed a
peculiarly rich and fertile soil, which affords nourishment
to a most luxuriant vegetation.
The country is well watered. Frequent rains keep
alive the sources of innumerable small streams, which
feed the larger rivers, of which there are many in Yiti
Levu. In Yanua Levu the rivers are not so large,
though numerous*
The Piver Beiva in Yiti Levu, the most important
river in Fiji, is formed by the junction of the Wainimbuka
and Wainimala. On its banks are numerous sugar and
other plantations. It flows into the sea in Lauthala Bay,
8 miles east of Suva, in the form of a delta; one of its
mouths is close to Kamba, 3 miles below Mbau. For
6 miles from the mouth the banks are covered by
mangrove swamps; after that, for about 20 miles up
stream, they are of sandy clay, 3 to 15 feet high, and


under cultivation of sugar cane, tbence they are high
and forest-clad. The Eewa has many tributaries, but
there are only four of importance. These are the
Wainimala, Wainimbuka, Waindina, and Waimanu, the
first two forming, at their junction near Yunindrala,
the Eewa main river, some 40 miles from the sea.
The Wainimala, like the Waindina and Waimanu,
rises in the high range which traverses the middle of
the island from north to south, culminating in Muani
Vatu. This river is very shallow, full of rapids, and only
navigable, even by the smallest boats, for about 3 miles.
The Waindina flows into the Eewa some 32 miles
from its mouth.
The Waimanu joins the Eewa some 12 miles from its
mouth.
The Wainimbuka drains the western and southern
slopes of the northern and eastern coast range.
The Singatoka , the next most important river in
Yiti Levu after the Eewa, rises in the centre of the
island. It is formed by the junction of certain lesser
streams and has many unimportant tributaries. In its
upper course it runs through deep gorges in the most
mountainous part of the island, but afterwards traverses
extensive valleys, while sandy hills are found near its
mouth.
The Mha river rises near Randan vatu, and, flowing
in a north-westerly direction, falls into the sea at Mba
Point. The banks for the first. 7or 8 miles from
mouth are merely mangrove swamps. After this, the
banks are of sandy clay, 4 to 10 feet high, and chiefly
under sugar-cane cultivation. There is a trestle bridge
at Mba, which has a span of 250 feet, and is 10 feet above
tlge river at high water, and 20 feet broad. It was built
by the Colonial Sugar Eeflning Company for their light
railway.
Opposite Earawai Mill there is a ford, the direct
crossing being about 50 feet long, and 2 to 4 feet deep at
low water, with a shingle bottom. The approach on the
left bank is very gradual. The right bank is 20 feet high,
but a cutting has been made to facilitate traffic.


There are many other rivers in Viti Levu, but none
are navigable for more than a few miles from their
mouths; of these the principal are the Navua, Tavua,
Samambula, Nasinu, Tamavua (which is the source of the
Suva water supply), Lami, Yisari, Teindamu, Waindalithi,
Nandi, and Sambeto.
Besides those in Yiti Levu, there are innumerable
rivers throughout the islands of the Fiji group, but the
only one of importance is the Lambasa in Yanua Levu.
Its banks are mangrove swamps for 7 miles from mouth,
thereafter sandy clay 6 to 15 feet high under sugar-cane
cultivation. It is crossed by one trestle bridge of 50-feet
span for the light railway between Lambasa and the sugar-
cane plantations which supply the sugar factory there
with material. There are no fords on this river.
Out of the large number of islands composing this
possession only some 80 are inhabited. Of these, Viti
Levu is the most important, from the fact that Suva, the
capital of the Colony, is situated on its south-eastern
coast. This island is the largest of the group, being
4,112 square miles in area. It is intersected with
mountain chains, the most mountainous part being the
northern central portion of the island known as the Tholo
District, in which there is a range called Koromboya, the
highest peak of which is Toma-ni-ivi (Mount Yictoria),
which is 4,555 feet high.
From the Koromboya range one offshoot, the highest
point of which is Koromba, or Pickering Peak (3,550
feet), runs in a south-westerly direction, practically to
the sea, while another offshoot runs nearly due south
till it reaches Muani Yatu, its highest point (4,000 feet),
whence it takes a south-easterly direction to the sea,
near Suva.
In the north-west of Yiti Levu, there is another
group of mountains, the highest point of which is Mount
Evans, 4,018 feet high.
The east coast is all mountainous, but no great heights
are attained.
Next to Yiti Levu in point of size comes Vanua
Levu , which lies to its north-east. Its area is 2,432


square miles. It is traversed from end to end by a range
of mountains, the main slope of which drains to the north-
west, with peaks between 3,000 and 4,000 feet high.
These mountains, being covered with dense forests along
their watershed, intercept the south-east trade winds, and
consequently leave the greater part of the island to the
north and west subject to long continued drought. On
the south coast, in Savu Savu Bay, are the hot springs
of Waikama, in which natives frequently boil yams and
other vegetables in a few minutes.
The coast line is all mountainous, but no very great
heights are reached. In the centre of the island, there
is a chain, which runs 17 miles in an easterly direction ;
thence it runs almost in a semicircle in a north-westerly
direction, reaching the coast near Mount Avuka. It
attains its highest point at Mount Thurston, 3,124 feet,
while the highest point on the island is Koro Mbasanga
(3,437 feet).
On Taviuni , the third island in point of size, having
an area of 217 square miles, there is a mountain range,
running from South Cape in a north-easterly direction,
its highest peaks being Des Yoeux Peak, 3,920 feet,
and Ngalau, 4,040 feet. The slopes of this range are
well adapted for agriculture, and, consequently, many
Europeans have settled on the island.
Kandavu , the south- westernmost island of the group,
is thickly populated, and is celebrated for its forests of
Kauri pine, which, in former times, used to provide
material for numbers of the large Fiji canoes. Its area
is 124 square miles. It is a mass of mountains, the
range following the shape of the island, the highest
peaks being Mount Washington, 2,750 feet, and Mount
Challenger, 2,130 feet.
Another island of importance is Ovalau, the chief
town of which, Levuka, was, until recently, the capital
of the archipelago. It is very nearly circular in
form and about 7 miles across, and is very mountainous,
rising to an elevation of 2,000 feet, and presenting, in


this small area of 43 square miles, all the features of
a great mountain system.
Rotumciy which was discovered by H.M.S. “ Pandora”
in 1793, lies some 400 miles to the north of Yiti Levu, in
latitude 12° 30' S. and longitude 177° 10' E. It is
seven miles long and three miles broad, and its area is
about 9,000 acres. Its principal export is copra.
Lying to the north-west, and some two to four miles
from the shore, are three small islets, Hattana, Hoflua,
and Waya. Of these, only the last named is inhabited,
and contains only one small village.
Among the other is lands of the group, are the Loma-
Loma s Yasawa , and Lau (Windward) islands, but
they are of lesser importance.
Lakes are found among the mountains on many
of the islands, but are of insignificant size.
All the larger islands are densely wooded, especially
on the 66 weather ” side, but in many localities the forests
have been cleared and been replaced by plantations.
Owing to the wooded nature of the country troops
operating there are liable to be ambushed or surprised.
The European towns are described under the
sub-heading “ Harbours.”
The Fijian centres of habitation, whether in coastal
towns, riverside villages, or th« remote districts of the
interior, are, in most cases, clean, healthy, and decidedly
attractive.
The larger towns are usually built round roomy
squares, and it is within this public place that the usual
village amusements take place and other more important
business is transacted. These towns were formerly often
fortified, with one or more earthen ramparts, faced with
stones, and surmounted by a stockade or fence of bamboo,
or cocoa-nut trunks, the whole being surrounded by a deep
moat. In many places, traces of these fortifications are
still to be found, notably in the interior of Yiti Levu,
where a typical example of a Fijian stronghold exists at
Fort Carnarvon.


The native houses, unlike those of New Guinea, are
not usually raised on piles, but on foundations, often
several feet in height, composed of coral and gravel.
The houses are substantially built of hard, durable
timber; the ground plan is generally rectangular ; the
ridge pole rests on long end and intermediate posts, and
the sides are supported by upright struts, which, as well
as the posts, are sunk in the ground. Between these are
reeds, fastened by strong cords of fibre, sennit, and wild
vine. The roof is thatched, sometimes with the leaf of the
sugar cane, but more frequently with grass and the
leaves of wild plants. In most cases the sides also are
thatched. A house is provided for each family, and the
girls sleep in separate quarters. In the chief provincial
towns there are churches, school houses, native court
house, club houses, and gaols.
The three ports of entry of the colony in order of
importance are Suva, Levuka, and Lautoka.
Suva Harbour , on the south coast of Yiti Levu is
about 2 miles long from E. to W. and from \ to 2 miles
broad, and is capable of accommodating the largest ships.
Its wharf, called Queen’s, has berths alongside for vessels
of 12, 14, and 26 feet draught respectively. A green
light is shown from the wharf over the harbour.
O #
A coal hulk is moored in 10 fathoms off the wharf,
and about 500 tons can be stored on board. Coaling can
proceed at all times.
The town of Suva, which is the capital of the colony
of Fiji, and principal seat of trade, has an excellent water
supply conveyed from the mountains. Its principal
thoroughfare is Victoria Parade, nearly a mile long.
The town possesses a Town Board, Town Hall (in
course of construction), two social clubs, Masonic
Lodges, Chamber of Commerce, an Agricultural and
Industrial Association, rifle, cricket, and tennis clubs,
several public parks, Botanical Gardens, a Roman
Catholic Cathedral, churches of the Church of England,
Wesleyan, and Presbyterian denominations, two banks,

and many stores and warehouses. It has also a custom
house, post office, hospital, lunatic asylum, prison.
Supreme Court, Magistrates’ Court, Public School and
other Government buildings, and a library with over
2,C00 volumes.
Levuka harbour on the east side of the island of Ovalau,.
comes next in importance to that of Suva ; it is about
tL mile broad and can accommodate ships of the largest
size. It possesses a wharf called the Queen’s W harf,.
400 feet in length. Vessels drawing 18 feet of water can
lie on the north side of it, and those drawing 12 feet on
the south side; there is also a berth for a vessel drawing
18 feet alongside the V-shaped addition to the wharf, on
the south side. A green light, visible for 2 miles, is
shown from the head of the wharf.
The town of Levuka, which consists of one long
street, called Beach Street, extends along the beach,
and occupies almost the whole of the level ground of
Ovalau, The dwelling-houses are perched on the rocky
mountain side above the town, and are approached by
steep winding paths or steps over rocky slopes. The
site was incapable of extension, so that the removal of
the official capital to Suva, where there is ample space
for a considerable town and suburban population, and;
ready access to the interior of the largest of the islands,,
was fully justified.
Levuka possesses three churches, a custom house,,
post office, two hotels, a bank, Masonic and other lodges,
two schools, and a good water supply. There are two
bathing places on the Totongo, and Waitovu, Falls
respectively.
Lautoka , the third port of entry, which is situated
on the north-west coast of Viti Levu, possesses a fine
deep water wharf.
Besides these three, Fiji possesses many other
harbours throughout the group, but no wharves or
disembarking facilities exist, and landing would nave to
be done in boats. They include :
(a) In Viti Levu.— Serua Harbour, Handronga
Harbour, Yunaniu (or Granby) Harbour,
Nukulau in Lauthala Bay, and Mba river.


(, h) In Vanua Levu. —Mbua (or Sandalwood Bay)
where supplies including cattle and sheep can
be obtained, Savu Savu Bay, Mali (Lambasa),

Judging by the census of 31st March 1901, the
approximate population of Fiji on 31st December 1902
must have been :

53,815
121,925
The decrease in the native population during 1902
was 454, the birth rate being 38*6 per 1,000, and the
death rate 43*7. The death rate of infants under one
year old was 24 per cent, in 1902, as opposed to 72 per


cent, in 1893, which is a very marked improvement, there
is, however, little doubt the native population is steadily
decreasing. In 1859 it was estimated at 200,000,
and by present statistics it is now under 100,000.
In 1875 the population suffered severely from the
ravages of measles, a disease up to then apparently
unknown in Fiji. It was introduced into the country
by H.M.S. “ Dido,” and it is believed that about 40,000
natives perished.
The European population of Fiji consists principally European,
of traders, plantation owners, and Government officials.
The Indian population consists of immigrants, Mans,
imported for labour on the sugar plantations, owing to
the incapacity of the native Fijians for this work. Ihe
first batch of these coolies was imported in 1879, and
they are now imported on an average of some 1,500 per
annum The average cost of introduction during the past
five years is 15/. 9s. lie/, per adult. The labourer is re-
cruited in India through the usual emigration agency
system, and comes to Fiji for 10 years, five of which he
spends in the service of the employer to whom he is mden-
Cured, and the second five as a free man, working where
he pleases. At the end of ten years he is entitled, with his
wife and family, to a free passage to India at the expense
of general revenue. The male Indian coolie is paid
Is. a day, and the female 9 d., finding their own food.
They receive free quarters and medical attendance.
The experiment has proved fairly successful, but die
Indian influx has certainly increased crime. The Indian
coolie is described as treacherous and untrustworthy,
with a pronounced tendency to go to law on every
opportunity.
Labour also has been imported from the .New Polyne-
Hebrides and Solomon Islands. These labourers, termed sians.
Polynesians, are indentured for a period of three years
only ; during this time they receive 3/. to 61. per annum,
as wao'es, in addition to food, clothes, accommodation,
and medical attendance. At the expiration of their term
of service, they are free to return home or re-engage by
the year at a wage of some 10/. to 12/. per annum.


In the cocoa-nut and banana plantations they are pre-
ferred to the Indian coolies, hut not for work in the
sugar fields.
The Fijians, although they regard immigrants, both
Indian and Polynesian, with suspicion and dislike, are
most friendly and hospitable towards Europeans. They
are a dark coloured, frizzly haired, bearded race, being
quite as tall and muscular as the finest of the western
Papuans, but much superior to them both in regularity
of feature and in degree of civilisation. They exhibit,
however, in some parts, signs of intermixture with the
Polynesians of Tonga and Samoa, who long ago established
colonies in the Fiji Islands, and have, to some extent,
modified both the customs and language of the aborigines ;
yet they remain undoubted Melanesians, and dilfer from
their eastern neighbours, not only in their scanty dress,
but in using the bow and arrow and making pottery,
neither of which are Polynesian practices. The dwellers
by the sea are of far finer physique than the tribes in the
mountainous districts.
Fijians are all expert swimmers, and show extra-
ordinary powers of endurance in the water.
The Fijians are cleanly in their habits and are very
particular about their personal appearance. Their dress
is of the scantiest, consistent with decency. They do not
load themselves with ornaments like the more savage
Melanesian tribe, but some of the women are tattooed.
The head and hair dressing of the Fijian is an object
of wonder and admiration to strangers, and on no other
part of his person does the native expend so much time,
pains, or skill. The hair is strong and wiry, and so
dressed that it will retain the position in which it is
placed, even when projecting to a distance of 6or 8
inches, according to the taste, social rank, district, or age
of the wearer. The length, shape, and colour of it vary ;
jet black, blue-black, ashy white, and several shades of
red prevail, but bright red, and, above all, flaxen tints
are the favourites, especially amongst the young and
women. One, two, or three cords of twisted hair (tombe)
fall from the right temple in young girls and women,
and it the privilege of the husband to cut these off


on marriage. The cleaning of the head is carried out by
a process of liming, after which the hair is bleached,
plastered and carefully combed, which occupies a good deal
of time, and the origin of the Fijian pillow is due to the
desire to preserve this magnificent head-dress at night.
The inhabitants of the Fiji group, though formerly Character,
addicted to inter-tribal warfare and faction fights, are
now, outwardly at least, docile and law-abiding subjects.
Their pursuits are agriculture, fishing and canoe Occupa-
building. The men spend their time in gardening, sailing, tlon-
and the heavier form of work, such as house-building, but
they are not energetic, and often take weeks to do what
could be done in as many days; the women are really the
hewers of wood and drawers of water. Nature has pro-
vided them with every necessity, both in food and raiment,
and their ambitions are few. They lead a careless, lazy
life, planting sufficient food for their feasting, entertaining,
and ceremonial occasions which form quite a part of their
national life.
The Fijians were formerly most pronounced cannibals, Food,
and human flesh was, till two generations ago, one of their
greatest luxuries, nor do they appear to have been at all
particular in their methods of obtaining it, for though
enemies and slaves were the usual victims, yet, rare
occasions, even relatives and friends have been sacrificed
to gratify this taste, which, mainly owing to the
missionary teachings, has now quite died out.
Their food at present consists mainly of vegetables,
but pigs and turtle are greatly appreciated. These are
roasted in open ovens called “ lovos,” which are holes
dug deep in the ground and filled with stones, made
red-hot by burning timber. The pigs and turtles, stuffed
with taro and yams, are covered with a thick layer of leaves
and placed in the oven. Then a covering of earth, some
four inches thick, is laid over everything. When the
steam penetrates the earth it is taken as a sign that the
food is cooked, and the contents of the oven are distri-
buted in green plaited baskets made of cocoa-nut palm
leaves. In ordinary life the cooking utensils consist of
earthenware pots with, occasionally, vessels of European


manufacture, but the oven is used when much cooking
has to be done.
The national drink is Yanggona, an infusion of Piper
Methysticum, commonly known as Kava, and. the
drinking thereof is frequently attended with much
ceremony. The proceedings are begun by the chief’s
herald, who shouts out at the top of his voice“ Yanggona.”
To this the assembled people reply “Mama” (chew it).
At this signal, the younger men, or young girls, of
the chief’s retinue, cutting portions of the yanggona root*
commence to chew it, and when sufficiently masticated,
throw it into the “ tanoa” (or yanggona bowl) and pour
water on it, gradually straining it. The form, ceremony,
and skilfulness of the particular man or girl who is
straining the yanggona, the number of times he or she
passes it through the fibre, the regularity in the number
of twists that are given it, and the nicety with which the
strainer finally wipes round the edges of the tanoa,
followed by the announcement that it is ready, which is
notified by giving three claps of the hands, followed by the
dispensing of it, and the final exclamation of “ Matha ”
(dry), when the bowl is quaffed, and the usual clapping of
hands, may be noticed in houses of the veriest commoners
as much as in that of a great chief, and are indicative of
deeply engrained customs, that time has not obliterated.
There is also a curious custom called the Yilavilairevo,
or firewalking, performed by one tribe only, which is
thus described by Mr. Allardyce in a lecture on Fiji
which he gave at the Colonial Institute on 17th
December 1903:
The circular earth oven around and through which
the natives walk is about twenty-five feet across. It is
dug out in the first instance to a depth of between two
and three feet, and then large logs of wood are stacked
up in it to a height of several feet above the level of the
ground. Some of these tree trunks are as much as
fifteen and twenty inches through. Stones, varying in
size from six inches to two feet across, are placed between
the logs and on the top, and the fire is kindled about
twelve hours before the firewalking takes place. Prior


to performing the ceremony such charred logs as remain
on the top of the stones are removed by long incombus-
tible rope vines, and the rough surface of the oven is
levelled. The temperature at the edge of the oven is
about 120° Fahr., while, on the one occasion when
a thermometer was suspended immediately over the
stones, it registered 282° Fahr., when the solder melted.
When the master of the ceremonies considers that the
oven is sufficiently levelled, the natives walk over it
bare-footed, and after doing so show no sign of having
passed through this extraordinary ordeal.
A physican, Mr. Fulton, in a paper on this subject,
states that he examined one of the men who was about to
walk across; his pulse was normal, bis feet rather cool, as
if they had been immersed in water, but showing no other
signs of preparation, and the soles were not callous.
After the walking the feet were still rather cool and in
no way scorched. The heat, he says, was great, though
the stones had ceased to glow. The temperature at the
edge of the oven was about one hundred and twenty
degrees, and more than double this over the stones.
They are basalt, and Mr. Fulton attributes the marvel
to the bad conducting power of that rock, which makes
it possible for a man to walk barefoot across, as his feet
are so short a time in contact with each stone. One or
two white men have w r alked through in shoes, without
burning the leather. This was at Raratonga (Cook
Islands), where a somewhat similar ceremony is
performed.
In former days polygamy was a recognised institution
among Fijians. As a rule the practice was restricted
almost exclusively to chiefs and men of wealth, for the
common people could not afford the luxury. To the
number of wives there was no limit. Now, however,
the old order of things has passed away, and the full
privileges of the English marriage law are enjoyed
throughout the Colony. These seem to commend
themselves to all, and the divorce court is rarely
resorted to.
Fijians nowadays are disinclined to have large
families, wdiich may account in part for the decreasing


population. Infantile mortality, however, is a still more
serious factor. Children after attaining the age of five
or six years are, as a rule, well nourished and cared
for, take abundance of outdoor exercise, are trained in
sports and industrial pursuits, and receive religious and
secular education.
The Fijians according to recent reports possess no
rifles. In the disturbances in 1876 they used what are
described as muskets, with which they inflicted some
loss on the Armed Native Constabulary.
Their other weapons are spears, slings, clubs, bows
and arrows, most of which are larger and heavier than
those of other Pacific Islanders, corresponding to the more
warlike character and greater strength of the people,
whose method of fighting is in close order, with great
noise and shouting.
Until the advent of the European missionaries, the
religion of the Fijians consisted of a sort of ancestor
worship. They had priests and temples, a complex
mythology, and a firm belief in a future state. The
priests possessed great power, being much consulted as
soothsayers. The temples were elaborately constructed,
surrounded by a walled enclosure, and sometimes built
on stone terraces. Human sacrifices were offered, and
superstition was rife.
Now the entire native population acknowledge
Christianity and the authority of the British Govern-
ment, and appreciate their beneficial influences. This
great change was mainly affected by the Wesleyan
missionaries, who commenced work in Lakemba,
in the eastern part of the archipelago, in 1835. The
struggle was a severe one, and many missionaries laid
down their lives for the cause.. Eventually King
Thakombau, himself a confirmed cannibal, was converted,
human sacrifices were abolished, and at the present
moment there is a church and school in nearly every
village. Though probably, in the majority of cases, this
Christianity is not of a very high standard, yet, taking
the previous state of things into consideration, the

progress made is remarkable, and the success of
missionaries in Fiji is probably unparalleled. The
Wesleyan missionaries work largely by means of native
teachers and ministers, in training and instructing whom
the time of the European staff is chiefly occupied.
All the children go to school, and almost all can read
and write. Throughout the group of islands the education
of the natives is entirely provided for by the Wesleyan
and Roman Catholic missionaries.
In 1902 the former had 1,383 schools with 2,638
teachers and 24,261 scholars, while the Roman Catholics
had 161 schools with 200 teachers and 1,890 scholars.

Native medical practitioners are educated at the
Colonial Hospital for a period of five years; then, after
passing various examinations, they are sent into their
own provinces, and do useful work.
The Fijian language belongs to the Oceanic or
Malayo-Polynesian type of human speech. It is not a
single language peculiar to the group generally, but is
modified, within certain limits, in perhaps over fifteen
different dialects. The distinctions in places are con-
siderable, so much so, indeed, that the speech of a hill
man from Viti Levu would be quite unintelligible in
Kandavu.
. Tiie Mbauan language, spoken in Tai Levu (Mbau
being the native capital), is the classic one of the group,
and possesses a copious vocabulary.
* Vide also Appendix 8., page 56.
i 31256.


Native literature is a modern growth, the outcome
of the efforts of European Wesleyan missionaries. The
Old and New Testaments have been translated, and,
at the present time, elementary works on various
branches of general knowledge are being published, while
a native Government paper called the 66 Na Mata,” an
entirely Fijian production, edited by the Native Com-
missioner, and published at the Government Printing
Office gives monthly to the natives all the news of the
outside world.
As the Fijian has progressed, his internal government
has been brought more into line with English institutions;
and the personal supervision by European officials, magis-
trates, and others, has regulated the progress, industry,
and happiness of the people.
The population, at the census of 1901, numbered
2,230, of which two-thirds are Wesleyans, and the
remainder Roman Catholics. The natives are of quite a
different type to the Fijians, resembling Malays more
than any other race. They are comparatively light
coloured, with long straight hair, and speak an entirely
different language to that of the Fijians.

Climate and Health.
Climate and Seasons—Temperature—Rainfall—
Winds—Earthquakes—Magnetic Variation—
Local Time —Health—6th Company R.E.-
Sanitation—Hospitals—Asylums.
Situated as isolated land masses of no great size, and
exposed to the constant and beneficent action of the
trade winds, the Fiji Islands are on the whole healthy
for the tropics.
Although on the weather side of the islands the
atmosphere is humid, and the vegetation profuse in
growth, while on the lee side the air is drier and the
soil more or less barren, yet there is no great corre-
sponding difference of temperature. January, February,
and March are, as a rule, the hottest months, July and
August the coolest. During 1902 the highest tempera-
ture in the shade at Suva was 94 (on April sth and fithj,
and the lowest was 58 (on September 7th).
The total rainfall at Suva in 1902 was 102*35 inches ;
the greatest daily rainfall being 7 'O6 inches on February
23rd ; it is undoubtedly heavier in other islands, but no
other measurements have been taken.
The rainfall extends over the whole year. From
June to the end of October is the period of least rain,
the heavier rains falling in the hot season, a great advan-
tage from an agricultural point of view, but the rainfall is
uncertain and variable. Since 1862, the thickly wooded
hills round Levuka have been cleared, and, in consequence,
the number of rainy days, though not the rainfall, has
been materially reduced. Before the clearing was effected,
the rain used to come in showers, which sank into the
ground, and refreshed the vegetation, whereas now it
descends in torrents and runs off the ground, carrying
awTiy loose soil and doing great damage.

During the winter months (April to November) the Winds,
prevalent winds are from the east-north-east to south-east.
From November to April north winds are often ex-
perienced, and in February and March heavy gales and
hurricanes are liable to occur. They usually begin from
north-east, pass round to north and north-west, from which
quarters they blow with the most violence; then veering
to westward they moderate. They generally last two or
three days, and are accompanied with heavy rains; the
inundations and the silt brought down by the rivers being
often very destructive to cotton, coffee, and other planta-
tions. These hurricanes, which are a great drawback to
the island, are sometimes called cyclones, and may occur any
time from December to April, but March is considered
the most dangerous month. They are occasionally
accompanied by a tidal wave, which causes considerable
damage.
Earthquakes are of infrequent occurrence. They are Earth-
said to usually take place in the month of February, but quakes,
are seldom severe, though several shocks may follow
rapidly on each other.
In 1900 the magnetic variation at Suva was 9° 40' Magnetic
east, and nearly stationary. variation.
The local time at Suva (which place is 11,000 miles Local time
from London) is 11 hours 55 minutes in advance of that
of Greenwich.
The climate may be said to be cool for the tropics, Health,
and the country remarkably free from zymotic or endemic
diseases. Paludal fevers appear to be unknown, and
dysentery is the only disease to which Europeans are
particularly liable ; but the enervating climate induces
affections of the nerves, rendering periodical changes to
a temperate climate necessary, more especially in the case
of women. No serious epidemic occurred during the year
1902, though influenza and dengue fever were common
at certain seasons. Every precaution has been taken to
prevent the introduction of bubonic plague. The
destruction of rats was encouraged by the payment
of 3d. for each one killed.


The European population at 31st December was
estimated at 2,548. The deaths during 1902 numbered
32, being at the rate of 12*55 per mille.
Prior to the arrival of the 6th Company, Royal
Engineers, in September 187 5 £ (vide Appendix A., p. 54),
there were no means of ascertaining how the climate would
affect men who had come out direct from England. The
following “ table of hospital admissions ” certainly shows
a high percentage of sickness, but it must be borne in
mind that, owing to an incorrect belief in the salubrity
of the climate, many men were sent out who were unfit
to serve at a tropical station, and also that the months of
January and February 1876 were particularly unhealthy
for Fiji.

tively are paid from public funds to the Town Boards of
Suva and Levuka.
There is a hospital at Suva maintained by Govern-
ment. It is under the charge of a resident medical
officer assisted by five European nurses, the whole being
supervised by the chief medical officer. During 1902
there were 1,198 patients treated, of whom 127 were
Europeans. The revenue for the year amounted to
2,250/. 12$. 2d., and the expenditure (including the
salary of the resident medical officer) to 3,025/. 7s. 7 d.
There are also six provincial hospitals established by
Government for the treatment of native Eijians. They
are under the charge of provincial medical officers and
are maintained by Government from public funds,
assisted by small grants from the funds of the provinces
benefited. In two provinces hospitals have been erected
by the natives at their own expense. They are under
the charge of a Government medical officer and are
assisted by a grant in aid from public funds. A pro-
vincial hospital has been established on the island of
Roturaa. It is under the charge of a medical officer
who is also Resident Commissioner.
The lunatic asylum at Suva is under the charge of a
European warder. The chief medical officer is
superintendent. During 1902 there were 15
admissions and 10 discharges and 1 deaths, leaving 21
inmates on 31st December. Revenue 232/. 17s. o d.,

There is regular steam communication with the

journey}, three or four times a month ; Auckland (4 days
journey), fortnightly, in connection with the San Francisco
mail service. In addition to this, Suva is a port of call
for the Canadian-Australian Royal Mail Line of steamers,
which ply between Vancouver and Sydney via Honolulu,
Suva, and Brisbane.

Owing to the insular nature of the Colony, the
principal means of inter-communication is by sea.
There is daily communication, by means of steam
launches, between Suva and the sugar districts of
Eewa and Navua, also a weekly service from Suva to
Lautoka via Levuka and Mba.
Communication between the various islands is main-
tained by a steamer, and a fleet of 134 small vessels, most
of which (88) are owned by natives who are acquiring
a large number of European-built boats, though canoes
are still used to a certain extent. These latter are
rapidly disappearing.
Suva is connected with Great Britain by “ all-British
lines ” owned by British companies—
(1) via Fanning Island—Victoria (Vancouver)
Canada.
(2) via Norfolk Island Brisbane Perth Cocos-
Keeling Islands Kodriguez Mauritius
Zanzibar —Aden—Egypt—Malta—Porthcurno.
(3) via Norfolk Island Mongonui Nelson
Sydney, then as in (2).
Postage to the United Kingdom and India, and to
Colonies and Protectorates which have adopted the penny
post agreement, is I d, per \ oz.; to the A-UStralian
Colonies, 2 d. per \ oz.; to other countries in the Postal


Union (which this Colony entered oii Ist September
1891) 2 \d. per \ oz.
Internal postal rates—l d. per oz.; newspapers, Id.
A parcel post with the United Kingdom was esta-
blished in June 1890. The rate is Is. for the first lb.,
and BcZ. per lb. afterwards.
Letters from England, sent via Sydney, reach Fiji
in about 50 days; letters via San Francisco or Vancouver
in about 31 days.
A telegraph line has lately been constructed between
Suva and Levuka. The route selected is from Suva
overland to Kamena, a distance of about 22 miles;
thence to Mbureta, on the island of Ovalau, by cable, a
distance of 11| miles, and thence overland to Levuka,
a distance of about 13 miles.
A telephone line of 105 miles, from Suva to the
north of Viti Levu, connects the centres of the sugar
industry and chief Government stations. The line runs
—Suva, Kausori (sugar factory), Kandurulolo (magis-
trate station), Viria, Vatuvula (magistrate stations),
Kumbumakita (hospital), Nandarivatu (garrison Armed
Constabulary), Koromboya, Mba, and Lautoka (sugar
factories).
Few roads fit for wheeled traffic exist outside the
municipal boundaries of Suva and Levuka. A good
metalled road leads from Suva to Nausori, which is the
headquarters of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company,
and another from Suva to Rewa. Round the various
sugar factories at Lautoka, Lambasa, Mba, Penang, and
Kavua, there are also short stretches of road, fit for
wheeled traffic. Otherwise the roads are merely bridle
tracks, which abound throughout all the islands. There
are suitable camping grounds alongside of these paths,
with ample supply of water and wood, and native villages
are to be found at short intervals.
There are no railways in Fiji with the exception
of a few miles of light railway, used by the sugar
refining companies at their various centres. These


railways have a 40-inch gauge, and the rolling stock
consist of two or three small locomotives, with 50 to
150 trucks of 2 tons burden each, at each place.
There are a few navigable rivers in the Fiji group.
The most important of these is the Rewa , which is
navigable for punts, boats, and flat-bottomed steamers for
about 30 miles. It is some 400 yards broad at the
village of Rewa but narrows down to some 50 yards at
the point where navigation ceases. Its depth is 4to
30 feet. The rate of the current during the dry season
is 4 to 6 miles per hour, but in the wet season it increases
up to 10.
The Rewa is liable to flood, and the tidal influence
is felt 26 miles from the mouth, after which point good
drinking water is obtainable.
There are no bridges over the Rewa, which is
nowhere fordable, but at Nausori, 16 miles from the
mouth of the river, there is a cable pontoon, owned by
Grove in men t, which is capable of conveying three or four
vehicles, or 100 men. The crossing takes from sto 15
minutes.
From the latest returns there are at present on
this river :—•
4 passenger launches (10 to 16 tons).
20 to 40 cane punts (30 tons each).
Many sailing cutters (5 to 20 tons).
6 to 10 tugs (steam).
A vessel drawing 8 feet can cross the bar, and proceed
up the river, at high water spring tide.
The Wainimala , a tributary of the Rewa, being very
shallow and full of rapids, is only navigable, by the
smallest boats, for about S miles.
The Singatoka is navigable for small flat-bottomed
punts for some 30 miles. It is 50 to 100 yards broad, and
4to 20 feet deep. A dangerous bar obstructs its mouth,
which cutters can only enter at high tide, and even then,
if there is much northerly swell, the entrance (which
is rendered still more difficult by two patches of rocks),
is impracticable.


During the rainy season the rate of current is about
5 miles per hour; in the dry season, 2 to 3 miles an
hour. Tidal influence is felt for some 15 miles up
stream.
The Mha river is navigable for punts, boats, and
flat-bottomed steamers for about 12 miles up stream.
Its breadth is from 200 yards to 50 yards at the
point where navigation ceases. In flood, this river rises
13 feet above normal, its usual depth being from 10 to
30 feefc. The rate of the current isdry season 2 miles
per hour, rainy season 6 miles per hour. Tidal influence
is perceptible for 20 miles up stream, after which point
good drinking water is procurable.
The boats on this river are one steamer of 30 tons, two
steam launches for towing purposes, six 30-ton punts,
several cutters 5 to 10 tons.
The Lamhasa , in Yanua Levu, is navigable for punts
and flat-bottomed steamers for a distance of 12 miles.
The boats at present on this river consist of one steam
launch, four 30-ton punts, and a few cutters. It is 75 to
50 feet broad and from 6to 30 feet deep. The current
flows at the rate of 4 miles an hour in the dry, and
6 miles an hour in the rainy season, while tidal influence
is perceptible up to 14 miles from the mouth.
For land transport purposes, the Armed Native
Constabulary, stationed in the mountains.at Nandarivatu,
keep a few pack bullocks, capable of carrying a load of
200 lbs., but otherwise no pack animals are procurable.
There is no vehicular transport as, except in the
vicinity of the sugar factories and Suva, the nature of
the roads is not suitable.
Native carriers are available in very large numbers.
They are described as excellent and indefatigable, and
capable of carrying 40 lbs. to 60 lbs., but packages for
transport should not exceed 40 lbs. in weight if any
distance is to be covered. The daily wage of these
porters is Is. 6d, to 2s.


There were some 2,400 horses in the Colony in 1903,
nearly all European owned, but very few riding horses
can be bought. Prices range from 20 to 50/.
For water transport, cutters can be bought at rates
varying from 50/. to 250/. according to tonnage.
Punts, iron or timber, cost up to 600/. according to
tonnage. Native boats cost 1 per linear foot.

The
of sugar for 1902
export
shows
an increase of
4,154 tons as compared with 1901, but the value has
considerably decreased, owing to the fact that during


the year the value, as declared for statistical purposes,
was reduced from 12/. to 7/. 10s. per ton.
Colonial distilled spirit, the export of which has
dropped from 158,224 gallons in 1900, and 137,937
gallons in 1901 to 29,299 gallons in 1902, seems likely
to disappear from the staple products, owing to the
high duties imposed by the Commonwealth, the large
distilleries at Nausori Mills having since been closed.
The export of copra is increasing, and is likely to
do so more rapidly in the near future, when the large new
areas which are annually planted out under Government
supervision come into bearing. Peanuts have been ex-
tensively planted of late, and candle-nuts grow freely all
over these islands.
The four products, sugar, copra, green fruit, and
colonial distilled spirit, made up over 98 per cent, of
the export trade of the Colony in 1902. The principal
minor exports are beche-de-mer, turtle-shell, peanuts,
maize, cocoa-nuts, and pearl-shell. Cocoa, coffee, limes,
ginger, and spices can all be grown in the Colony. The
cultivation of cocoa has lately attracted some attention,
and there are now some 200 acres under cultivation.
The value of pearl-shell exported during 1902 was
790/., turtle-shell, 1,278/., and beche- de-mer, 3,404/.

The cultivation of sugar cane forms the staple
agricultural industry of the Colony. Of the five sugar
mills in the Colony, three are owned by the Colonial
Sugar Eefining Company, Limited, of Sydney. A
fourth mill has been erected by this company at
Lautoka, # on the island of Yiti Levu, which commenced
crushing in June 1903. The total area of land under
cane cultivation in the Colony is estimated at 27,279
acres, from which were produced 337,163 tons of cane.
* This brings the number up to 6, but there are at present no
particulars of the daily output of this mill.

Navua 2,356 acres were cultivated, producing 45,863
tons of cane, valued at 22,873/.
The cultivation of Para rubber is being systematically
extended, and spices are also being widely planted, while
tobacco may claim an established position as an
agricultural product, a fair portion of the native taxes
being paid in it. It does not yet form an export,
though it is expected to do so very shortly, as the largest
firm of tobacco and cigar manufacturers in New Zealand
have recently opened a branch establishment in Suva.
After many years of experiment the principal growers in
Yiti Leva have succeeded in producing the fine Sumatra
leaf, used for the outer wrapping of cigars, and this
may become a valuable export. At present the locally
grown tobacco is made up into cigars, cigarettes, and
smoking tobacco for local consumption, which is
considerable.
The agricultural implements of the Fijians are few
and simple ; the ground is dug with long pointed sticks
and hoes made of turtle bone or oyster shell, and, when
broken up, is weeded by hand. Iron and steel tools are
replacing these primitive implements. Before American


axes and other steel tools were introduced, the natives
used stone axes; for knives, they used shells and split
bamboos ; plaited cords of fibre and wild vines were
substitutes for nails, and, even now, these home made
articles have not been entirely superseded.
The following are the average rates of wages: Wages,
carpenters, painters, coopers, blacksmiths, 14$. per day ;
overseers, 80/. to 200/. per annum, with quarters.
There is a botanic station at Suva, from which Botanic
economic plants are distributed free of charge. During station.

Europeans mainly depend on imported food supplies,
while natives live principally on the products of food
plantations, but also purchase imported food.
Vegetables of many sorts thrive and are cultivated in Food pro-
Fiji. They comprise Indian corn, tea, tobacco, pea-nuts, ducts and
rice, sugar cane, coffee, breadfruit, yams, ndalo, or taro, supplies,
(the Fijian “ staff of life ”), arrowroot, tapioca, sago, and
pepper, while fruits comprise bananas, pineapples, custard
apples, papaws, alligator pears, citrons, lemons, limes,
shaddocks, guavas, tamarinds, oranges, grenadillas, cocoa-
nuts, plantains, pomegranates, and melons.

under cultivation:—

There are also very large areas of native cultivation,
which for the most part consist of foodstuff plantations.
In addition to the vegetable products referred to
under agricultural industries, the following commercial
vegetable products are found:—Cotton, ramie fibre,
chincona, candlenut, croton and castor oils, turmeric,
ginger and nutmeg; timber of all sorts is comparatively
plentiful, while there are many plants, &c., which yield
material for native clothing, mats and baskets, cordage, &c.
The dense vegetation of the islands is thoroughly
tropical in character. On some of them are extensive
areas of cocoa-nut palm plantations, many of which are
European owned. Sandalwood is now practically non-
existent, but there are many species of cone-bearing
trees, from one of which, called the “ Ndakua,” a good
deal of resin was at one time obtained, but this tree,
like the sandalwood, is now becoming more or less scarce.
The Yesi and Ndilo trees are much used for building.
Mangroves are largely found on the swamps by the
sea shore, and other trees are the Yaivai, Ndamanu, Fijian
boxwood or Mbuamhua. There is a timber light as cork,
known to the natives as the Kara, and the Wiriwiri is
but little heavier. There is also the excellent timber
tree, Ndakua salusalu, resembling Kauri pine, whilst
tavu tavu furnishes the best timber for piles sunk in
the ground. Bamboos and sago palms exist in large
quantities ; the ironwood tree (casuarina) flourishes, and
on the mountains, at an elevation of 2,000 feet, hollies
are found; there are also many varieties of flowering
plants and variegated shrubs.
Domestic animals and birds comprise horses, cattle,
sheep, pigs, goats, and poultry. Horses are imported
from New Zealand, and Australia, and do fairly well.
The pur© Hereford breed of cattle, imported from
Australia and New Zealand, thrive well on some of the
inlands, where there are now large herds.
Horses, mules, and oxen are used on the sugar estates
for ploughing, and the native Fijians are being encouraged
to use bullock transport for their produce, &c.


Sheep, which are imported from New Zealand, do
not do well, owing to the profuse vegetation.
Pigs originally imported, do very well and are
numerous, but are not allowed in the native villages.
Goats and poultry thrive and are plentiful.
In 1903, the foJlowing were in existence in the
Colony :

Birds comprise varieties of wild duclk, parrots, pigeons,

the golden dove species.
Lizards are plentiful. Snakes, bo)th land and water
exist, but are few in numbers and apparently innocuous.
Beetles, butterflies, and moths are plentiful in all parts
of the group, as are other varieties of iinsect life, including
sandflies, mosquitos, scorpions, centipedes, fireflies, ants,
and common flies. The ordinary animal pests, such as
the tsetse fly, tick, and rinderpest, are unknown.
The marine fauna are extensive im variety and unsur- Marine
passed in beauty. A marvellous number of fish of all fauna,
shapes, sizes, and colours are found among the coral
areas of the group. Sharks abound, but there are no
alligators in the rivers or creeks. There are a few
oyster beds in some parts of the group, but the oysters
are large, and of inferior quality. Crabs and prawns are
plentiful, while crayfish are frequently met with in
certain districts. Turtles abound at certain times of
the year.


CHAPTER VI.
Historical.
Discovery and Early Voyages—-
European Settlements —Annexation by Great
Britain —Native Troubles —Rotuma.
Fiji and its surrounding islands were discovered by
Tasman, in 1643, during his famous voyage, in which
he discovered New Zealand and Tasmania. The next
known visitor to these islands was Captain Cook in
1773; and Bligh, after the “Bounty” mutiny, passed
by them in 1789. Dumont d’Urville, in 1827, made a
detailed reconnaisance of the archipelago, and in 1840
Captain Wilkes, of the American exploring expedition,
made a tolerably complete survey.
Early in the nineteenth century a number of convicts,
who had escaped from New South Wales, succeeded in
establishing themselves on Yiti Levu, and, being desperate
and well armed men, managed to acquire a considerable
amount of power among the murderous cannibals living
on the island. Partly through their assistance it came to
be recognised that a lucrative, if somewhat dangerous,
trade was possible, and boats began in some numbers to
visit the archipelago to obtain trepang, sandal wood, and
other products.
A few years later a small colony of Australians
settled in Levuka, and received fresh additions from time
to time, and about the same date, in 1835, the Wesleyan
missionaries began to work in this archipelago, and met
with considerable success.
In 1859 Thakombau, the most powerful chief of Fiji,
offered the sovereignty of the islands to Great Britain.


This offer was finally declined in 1862. About that
time the demand for cotton, owing to the American
market being closed by the civil war, led to an influx of
Europeans into Fiji, for the purposes of cotton cultiva-
tion. In June 1871 certain Englishmen set up a Fijian
Government with the principal chief, Thakombau, as
king. A constitution was agreed upon, and a Parliament
elected. The Parliament and Government soon drifted
into mutual hostility, and the Ministry latterly governed
without the aid of Parliament.
The question of annexing Fiji had been agitated in Annexa
Australia and England since 1869, and, in August 1873, tion by
Lord Kimberley commissioned Commodore Goodenough,
commanding the squadron on the station, and Mr. E. L.
Layard, the British Consul in Fiji, to investigate and
report on the matter. They reported, on the 21st
March 1874, that the native chiefs, with the assent of
the Europeans living in Fiji, had made an offer of the
cession of the sovereignty of the islands, but the terms
of the offer were not acceptable. Consequently, Sir
Hercules Robinson, the Governor of New South Wales,
was despatched to Fiji in September 1874 to negotiate.
This mission was completely successful, and the
sovereignty of the islands was ceded to Great Britain by
Thakombau, Maafu, and the other principal chiefs in a
deed of cession dated the 10th day of October 1874.
A charter was shortly afterwards issued by the Crown
forming the islands into a separate colony, and providing
for their government.
Sir Hercules Robinson acted as first Governor, but
the Colony was administered by Mr. Layard till the
arrival of Sir A. H. Gordon as the proper Governor.
He was sworn in at Levuka in September 1875, and on
the 23rd of the same month the colonial steamer
“Egmont” arrived, having on board three officers of
Royal Engineers, one officer A.M.D., with 62 non-
commissioned officers and men of the 6th Company R.E.,
also a large quantity of machinery, stores, and provisions,
and on the 29th of* the same month they and the stores
were landed and located in Levuka.


In 1873, 1874, and 1876 small punitive expeditions
were undertaken against certain cannibal tribes, living
in the eastern and western highlands of Yiti Levu.
These were all successfully carried out by the Armed
Native Constabulary, the final expedition in 1876 resulting
in the entire pacification of the island. It was conducted
by Lieut. Knollys, 32nd LX, who succeeded in disarming
the opposing tribes. Since then no further punitive
expeditions have been necessary, and the islands have
continued to prosper and make steady progress.
This island was discovered by H.M.S. “ Pandora” in
1793, but did not come under British influence till 1879
when the three principal Eotuma chiefs offered the
islands to Great Britain, and they were annexed on
the 13th of May 1881.

Government of Rotuma.
The Fiji Islands form a Crown colony, administered Admini
by a governor and an executive council of four official stratum
members. The laws are regulated by a Legislative Council,
which consists of the Governor, ten officials, and eight
non-official nominated members, of whom six are elected
and two (the Native members) selected by the Governor
from names submitted to him by the great council of
chiefs.
A large share of self-government has been conceded Native
to the natives. Their village and district councils are govern
recognised, and have been improved, and supplemented ment *
by an annual meeting of the high chiefs, and represen-
tatives from each province, which is presided over by the
Governor, and is called the great council of chiefs.
The regulations recommended by these bodies have,
however, to receive the sanction of the Legislative
Council before acquiring the force of law.


The Colony is divided into 17 provinces (Matanitus),
each under the control of a European Commissioner, or
a Roko Tui (Chief Native Officer).
The provinces of Fiji, their Rokos, and official
headquarters are: —

These three provinces consist of practically
the whole of the mountainous interior
of Yiti Levu (27 districts). They have
<| no hereditary or principal chief, but are
j ruled by European Commissioners, who
exert a certain amount of influence
through the petty chiefs of each district


Each province is divided into “ tikinaor districts.
The head officer of the district is termed a Mbuli, and
has under him the chiefs of Towns, and a number of
minor officials. The Mbuli presides over the monthly or
bi-monthly district meeting, while the Chief of the Town
presides over the Village Council. This latter generally
holds a meeting once a month. The Eoko is the head of
the province, and is alone responsible to the Governor
for its administration. All the Rokos meet his Excellency
in annual conclave, for the discussion of native affairs.
The legal code in force is arranged to meet the
special exigencies of the country. Breaches of native
regulations are dealt with entirely by native magistrates
in°the native courts, except the more serious offences,
when native magistrates sit with European,

The Imperial Loan bears no interest and has hitherto
been repaid at the rate of 1,040/. ss. Id. per annum.
Arrangements for the acceleration of the rate of repay-
ment are now under consideration. The remainder of
the public debt consists of debentures bearing interest
at 4J per cent. A sum of 1,500/. per annum is applied
to the redemption of these debentures. The interest on
debentures so redeemed is applied to the further reduction
of the debt.
A considerable portion of the revenue (in 1902 over Taxation
19,000/.) is raised from the taxation of natives. The
following is the method adopted :
Once every year the provinces are severally assessed
by the Legislative Council for a fixed amount of tax,
which is delivered in the form of produce consisting
of sugar cane, copra, tobacco, yanggona, cotton, maize,


trepang, and occasionally green fruit and yams. These
articles are disposed of as follows :
Sugar cane is sold to the sugar mills under contracts,
which are generally entered into for a term of years ; copra
is sold by public tender annually, at a fixed price per ton
for all that is received; tobacco, maize, and other pro-
ducts are sold by tender, or by public auction, according
as the quantity from time to time is contributed, and
the state of the market will allow, or renders expedient.
The provincial Board of Assessment, consisting of
the Mbulis, presided over by the Boko, distributes the
tax among the different districts. There is then a further
subdivision among the different villages by the district
Boards of Assessment, each presided over by its Buli.
The amount and kind of produce paid by each province
and district is recorded, and, should the total value in
any case exceed the amount of the assessment, the surplus
is returned in the form of money.
The legal tender currency, and the only coin in
circulation, is British sterling: The amount of coin in
circulation is estimated at 70,000/. There is no Govern-
ment note issue. The Bank of New Zealand has
branches at Suva and Levuka, and the Bank of New
South Wales a branch at Suva.
The Governments of the following Powers are repre-
sented by consuls at Suva: the German Empire, Sweden
and Norway, and Italy, while that of the United States
of America is represented, both there and at Levuka, by
a commercial agent.
The distance of Botuma from the seat of govern-
ment, the infrequency of intercommunication, and the
fact that the inhabitants differ entirely from Fijians in
language, and in polity, necessitate a government on
other lines than that of the Colony generally. A
European Commissioner resides on the island, and is,
subject to the Governor of Fiji, the chief executive
and judicial authority in Botuma. The Commissioner’s
Court, except in capital cases, takes the place of the
Supreme Court of Fiji, and there are two native
stipendiary magistrates, who have jurisdiction in minor
cases.


The island is divided into seven districts, over each of
which a chief, appointed by the Governor, presides. The
framing of local laws is entrusted to the Rotuma
Regulation Board, consisting of the Resident Com-
missioner, the chiefs, and magistrates, whose enactments
are subject to the approval of the Legislative Council of
Fiji. The post of Resident Commissioner has now been
amalgamated with that of Provincial Medical Officer.

The local organised forces of Fiji consist of (a)

The Volunteers were raised in 1899, under Ordinance
No. X. of 1898 (dated 19th November), as amended by
Ordinance No. 11. of 1902 (dated 12th April).
The object of this force is :
(1) To repel invasion.
(2) To quell local disturbances. 4
The force may be called out for actual military
service by the Governor, should he have cause to
anticipate invasion or disturbances, and be kept under
arms as long as required. During the period the force
is called out, it shall be considered to be on “actual
military service,” and subject to the Army Act, Part 1.,
while any member of the force, neglecting to come out
for duty, unless physically incapacitated, may be pro-
ceeded against as a deserter, under the provisions of
that Act.
As regards the discipline of the force, when not on
actual military service, the Commandant may, subject to
the approval of the Governor, discharge any member, not
an officer, or disrate a non-commissioned officer, and the
Governor, on recommendation of Commandant, may
discharge any member of the force.


The force is at present organised in a battalion of
4 companies, and the establishment laid down is as
follows :
Officers. Other Ranks
# Staff 5 2
Companies - 12 200
The strength of the force on 31st December 1903,
was 200 all ranks, including 30 cadets.
The Governor may, at any time, increase the number
of Medical Officers, or Sergeant Instructors, and there
may be always two supernumerary 2nd Lieutenants in
the force, who can be temporarily attached to any
company until they are absorbed.
Officers are appointed and commissioned by the
Governor.
To enlist in the force (in which, service is perfectly
voluntary) the following qualifications are necessary :
(a) To be a British subject.
( b ) „ between 18-45 years of age.
(c) „ physically fit.
( d ) „ of wholly European descent.
Cadets may be enrolled in cadet companies with the
written consent of their parents between ages of 14
and 18.
The rate of pay while on actual military service is
settled by the Governor, and pensions are granted to
officers and men of the force, if disabled, and to widows
of officers and men killed, on actual military service.
The force is armed with the Martini-Enfield ’303
rifle.
As regards the dress of the non-commissioned officers
and men, they have a ceremonial dress of white, and a

service dress of khaki, of the ordinary infantry pattern
(For officers’ uniform see Appendix C.)
The training consists of weekly drills and a musketry
course.
The Armed Native Constabulary is a military corps,
and not a police force, the Colony being policed by quite a
distinct and purely civil body. It was first raised in the
troublous times of King Thakombau. In those days the
battalion is said to have been at one time 1,400 strong.
This force has been employed in punitive expeditions
in 1873, 1874, and 1876, against the cannibal tribes in
the eastern and western highlands of Yiti Levu.
In 1876, under command of Lieutenant L. F. Knollys,
32nd L. 1., the Constabulary completely subdued and
disarmed these tribes, who resisted with considerable
tenacity and skill. Lieutenant Knollys’ reports indicate
that the Constabulary displayed the greatest bravery on
many occasions, attacking fortified caves and stockades
with great resolution and determination, and also showed
considerable discipline
The force is regulated by Ordinance No. 5 of 1889
(12th November), as amended by Ordinance No. VIII.
of 1890 (dated 6th December), which also provides for its
discipline.
It is organised in two companies, and the establish-
ment, which from time to time is laid down by the
Legislative Council, at the end of 1903 was: —
5 European officers.
1 „ Sergeant-Major.
5 native officers.
2 „ Chaplains.
109 other ranks.
The force was then 1 native officer and 1 “ other
ranks ” below establishment.
The European officers are commandant, deputy-
commandant, adjutant, paymaster (and quartermaster),
and one other European officer, also a European
sergeant-major, while the native lieutenants, chaplains,


and surgeon-lieutenants are all 6i ratus ” or noblemen,
with hereditary titles.
The headquarters are at Suva, the capital of the
Colony, and a large detachment is stationed in the
interior at Nandarivatu. The garrison there is responsible
for the peace of the wild highland tribes, and has been
most usefully employed in the construction of roads,
bridges, telephone lines, &c. No man under 5 feet
7 inches, with a chest girth of less than 36 inches
and weighing less than 148 lbs., is admitted into the
force, the average height of which is at present 5 feet
9 inches. There is no definite reserve, but, as the period
of service is only three years in the ranks, many addi-
tional trained men, who have completed their three years’
service, are available. Officers are appointed by the
Governor.
The force is recruited by voluntary enlistment, but
under provisions of Clause o, Ordinance No. 5, of 1882
(whereby the force is regulated), if the numbers of
officers and constables, determined by resolution of the
Legislative Council, are not enrolled by voluntary
engagement, then every unmarried male Fijian, of
sound bodily constitution, and being between the ages
of 17 and 40, shall be liable to serve ; and, by Clause 6 of
above Act, the Governor in the event of necessity, may,
by proclamation, declare the number of constables
required for service from each constabulary district of
the Colony. On publication of this proclamation every
male Fijian, between ages of 17 and 40, in any district
named in the proclamation, shall be liable to serve as a
constable for one year, the ordinary period of enlistment
being for 3 years. The men are enrolled by the Mbuli of
their district.
The annual rates of pay are as follows :
- 450/. per annum, tees, and quar-
ters.
tDeputy-commandant 25/. per annum, and quarters.

The Constabulary are armed with the Martini-Enfield
• 303 rifle, and for uniform, the men wear white “ sulus ”
in the native fashion, which are somewhat like Highland
kilts, and also resemble the national costume of Greece
and Albania. Their tunics are of blue with red facings,
and they also have a red Kamarband. (For officers 5,
uniform see Appendix C.)
The Armed Native Constabulary are practically
regular troops. They are under proper discipline, and
their training consists of daily drills and a musketry
course.
There are three Rifle Clubs in Fiji, two being at
Suva, and one at Levuka, with a combined total of 207
members (in 1901), the majority of whom were Volun-
teers. Members of these clubs, other than Volunteers,
are not necessarily available for the defence of the
Colony.
The Police force in the towns of Suva and Levuka
has an establishment of 4 European officers, 1 European
sergeant, and 36 Fijians, which establishment was
complete at the end of 1903. This force is regulated by
Ordinance No. 30 of 1876, and is purely a civil one. It
is armed with the Martini-Enfield ‘303 rifle, and its train-
ing consists of daily drills.
* Also receives pay as Inspector of Police,
r Also receives pay as Paymaster and Quartermaster of Police.


In addition to the above there are the Rural Police,
consisting of four European sergeants, 13 native sergeants
and 45 native and Indian constables under the control ot
the magistrates in the various districts.
There are two prisons, one at Suva and one at Leyuka,
under the charge of the Superintendent of Prisons.
There is also a gaol at each magistrate’s station. All
prisoners serving sentences exceeding three months, and,
in the case of certain adjacent districts, one month, are
sent to Suva prisons. The total number of prisoners com-
mitted to Suva and Levuka prisons during 1902 was 833
Prisoners are employed on public works, roads, and as
boats’ crews.
The cost of the police department for 1903 was
1,937/. 10s. 3d. _ ... ~ i
The Volunteers represent about 68 per mille ot tne
entire European population, and about 111 per mille of
entire male European population ; tkeir cost tor 1903
was 648/. 9s. Id., or about 3/. 3s. per head all ranks.
The Armed Native Constabulary excluding Europeans
represent *097 of entire population, arid 17 of entire male
population excluding Europeans; their cost for 1903 was
2 277/. 12.9. Id., or about 19/. per head all ranks.

for 1903 was 4,863/. 11s. od or about 10c/. per head of
entire population.


APPENDIX A.
The 6th Company Royal Engineers in Fiji.*’
The Colony of Fiji was ceded to England in October*
1874, and it then become necessary to consider how
Public Works, Surveys, &c. could best be carried out.
It was known that skilled European labour was scarce
and expensive, and it was therefore decided to send out a
Company of Royal Engineers to form the nucleus of a
Public Works and Survey Department.
The 6th Company, Royal Engineers, consisting of
2 officers and 62 men, with an Army Medical Officer
attached, was accordingly placed under orders, and
embarked early in July, 1875. Major F. S. Pratt, R.E.*
was also ordered to Fiji to take up the appointment of
Surveyor General, and was given local rank of Lieut.-
Colonel.
The arrangements regarding the pay, clothing, &c.*
of the officers and men, as between the War Department
and the Colony, were, broadly speaking, as follows.
The War Department undertook to defray the charges
for regimental pay, clothing, equipment, and food, while
the Colony paid the working pay of the N.C.O.s and
men, and the Colonial allowances of the officers.
The above arrangements were to hold good until the
31st March 1879, after which date the Colony, if the
services of the company should be still required, were
to bear all charges.
The company, on arrival, had, as their first work*
the erection of their own barracks, workshops, <fec., but
were soon employed on Public Works and Surveys
generally. No very large engineering works were
undertaken, as the Colony was poor, and funds could
not be made available for any but small essential ser-
vices. A good deal of survey work was carried out in
* Compiled from a paper on this subject by Colonel N. M.
Lake, R.E., who was the Subaltern of the Company.


connection with the proceedings of the Land Commission
and amongst the Public Works undertaken were roads,
bridges, sea walls, wharves, &c.
After the company had been two years in the Colony
the question of their retention for the full period of the
arrangement above referred to, came up for consideration.
It was generally recognised that the amount of skilled
labour furnished by the company was out of proportion
to the resources of the Colony and that many of the men
were not employed to the fullest advantage. The
Governor consequently recommended that the head-
quarters of the company should return home and that
a detachment of 15 selected N.C.O.s and men, under the
Subaltern Officer should remain behind to carry on the
limited amount of work that the Colony could afford to
undertake. The recommendations were approved, and
the headquarters of the company, under the Captain,
with Colonel Pratt and the Medical Officer, were sent
home in December, 1877.
The detachment which was left behind remained in
the Colony until the 31st March 1879, when it returned
home. The reasons for its recall were briefly as follows.
As previously stated, the whole of the charges for pay,
clothing, &c., would, after the 31st March 1879, fall
upon the Colony, and it was doubtful, having this in view,
whether the retention of the men in the Colony would be
any real economy. The Governor, however, was anxious
that some of the men, who had done especially good work,
should remain in the Colony and these took their discharge
and obtained good appointments. The balance of the
detachment, 6 N.C.O.s and men, under the Subaltern
Officer, who, since the departure of Colonel Pratt had
been Acting Surveyor General, embarked for England
on the Ist April 1879.
