ERRATA.
EXPLANATORY HANDBOOK ON THE INCOME TAX
ASSESSMENT ACT 1936.
The final paragraph on page 183 of the Handbook reads as follows ;
“ Provided that every alteration-or addition which has the effect
of imposing any fresh liability, or increasing any existing liability,
shall be notified to the taxpayer affected, and, unless made with his
consent, shall be subject to objection”.
The paragraph quoted above is shown in the Handbook as forming
portion of section 50 (1) of the 1922-1934 Act, whereas in fact it forms portion
of section 37 (1) of the 1922-1934 Act. The correction of the error will
entail the following alterations in the Handbook :
The figures “ 37.—(1.) ” to be inserted on page 183 before the word
“ provided ” in the paragraph quoted above.
The figures “ 50. —” to be inserted on page 185 before the figure “ (2.) ”
in the first line of that page.
The figures “ 37 (1) ” to be inserted on page 6 before the figures
“ 50 (1) ” appearing in the line on that page now reading “ 185
Objections 182 50 (1)”.


PREFACE.
THIS handbook is not intended to be a complete'commentary on
the Income Tax law. The comments and explanations are
restricted to the differences between the Income Tax Assessment Act
1936 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1922-1934.
The sections of the 1936 Act are printed in their sequence on the
left-hand pages of the handbook, and, on the right, are set out the
corresponding sections of the previous Act. Owing to this arrange-
ment, the sequence of the previous Act has necessarily been broken,
and in order that the meaning of many of the sub-sections and para-
graphs may readily be understood, the introductory words of some
sections have been repeated several times. Any such repetitions of
introductory words have been shown in italics.
Brief footnotes are given explanatory of such of the new provisions
as differ in any substantial way from the terms of the previous Act.
The explanatory notes are printed in reduced type.
The sequence of the sections in the Act follows the arrangement in
the model Bill of the Royal Commission in order to achieve uniformity
with the States. This arrangement itself is a matter of considerable
importance, as it is designed to help the taxpaying public, as well as
officials of the various Departments, as often as they may he called
upon to refer to Commonwealth and State Acts, by automatically
providing a ready reference to comparable sections.
An effort has been made by the Royal Commission in the drafting
to make each section clear and concise, and to avoid, so far
as the technicalities of an Income Tax Act will permit, sections
or sentences of undue length, which present difficulties of interpretation.
Although there are 266 sections in the 1936 Act, as contrasted with
100 sections in the previous Act, both the Acts contain approximately
the same number of pages of printed matter. The larger number
of sections in the 1936 Act is due to the breaking down of some of
the longer and more involved sections of the previous Act into shorter
self-contained sections for greater facility in reference and
interpretation.
The references in the marginal notes throughout the 1936 Act
to the comparable sections in the previous Act have been omitted in
this handbook, for the reason that the provisions of the previous Act
have been printed in full.
R. EWING,
Commissioner of Taxation.
31st August, 1936.

Act.
(B) The words “out of its profits” have

dividend should not include a return of

Definitions.
■mount credited to them as shareholders ”
were inserted to make it clear that a
“ distribution ” refers to amounts credited
as well as amounts paid.


“income from personal exertion” or “income derived from
personal exertion” means income consisting of earnings,
salaries, wages, commissions, fees, bonuses, pensions,
superannuation allowances, retiring allowances and retir-
ing gratuities(A), allowances and gratuities received in the
capacity of employee or in relation to any services
rendered ( B >, the proceeds of any business carried on by the
taxpayer either alone or as a partner with any other
person, any amount received as a bounty or subsidy in
carrying on a business (C), the income from any property
where that income forms part of the emoluments of any
office or employment of profit held by the taxpayer, and
any profit arising from the sale by the taxpayer of any
property acquired by him for the purpose of profit-making
by sale or from the carrying on or carrying out of any
profit-making undertaking or scheme, but does not
include—
(a) interest, unless the taxpayers’ principal business
consists of the lending of money, or unless the
interest is received in respect of a debt due to
the taxpayer for goods supplied or services
rendered by him in the course of his business; (D)
or
(b) rents or dividends;

means all income not being income from personal exertion;
“ income tax ” means the income tax imposed as such by any
Act as assessed under this Act;
“ liquidator ” means the person who, whether or not appointed

the winding-up of a company;
“live stock” does not include animals used as beasts of
burden or working beasts in a business other than a
business of primary production ;( E )
“ mortgage ” includes any charge, lien or encumbrance to secure
the repayment of money ;(B)
(A) The definition as re-drafted makes
it clear that “ retiring ” qualifies both allow-
ances and gratuities. The reference in the
previous Act to amounts “ not paid in a lump
sum ” has been deleted, as it is considered
that retiring allowances and retiring
gratuities should be treated as income from
personal exertion, whether or not they are
paid in a lump sum. Five per centum of
allowances and gratuities received in a
lump sum still remains assessable income,
vide section 26 ( d).
(B) These words are designed to include
secret commissions. It has been held that
allowances in the nature of secret com-
missions were not subject to taxation under
the previous Act, as they are not made to
a person in the capacity of an employee.
The person receiving them is seldom an
employee of the donor. There is no good
reason why such amounts should not b"
treated as assessable income.


“ Income from personal exertion ” or “ income derived by any
person from personal exertion ” means income consisting
of earnings, salary, wages, commission, fees, bonuses,
pensions, superannuation allowances, retiring allowances
and gratuities not paid in a lump sum, allowances received
in the capacity of employee, and the proceeds of any
business carried on by the taxpayer either alone or as a
partner with any other person, and any income from any
property where the income forms part of the emoluments
of any office or employment of profit held by the individual
and any profit specified in paragraph ( ha) of the defini-
tion of “ Income ”, but does not include interest, unless
the taxpayer’s principal business consists of the lending
of money, and does not include rents and dividends;
“ Income from property ” or “ income derived from property ”
means all income not derived from personal exertion;
“ Income tax ” means the income tax imposed as such by
any Act as assessed under this Act;
“ Liquidator ” means the person who, whether or not appointed
as liquidator, is the person required by law to carry out
the winding-up of a company;
“ Mortgage ” includes any charge, lien, or encumbrance to
secure the repayment of money upon which interest is
payable, and any collateral or supplementary agreement,
whether in writing or otherwise, and whether or not
it be one whereby the terms of any mortgage are varied
(C) These words make the intention of
the law clear that such receipts are to be
treated as personal exertion income.
(D) Under this definition, interest
received in respect of trading debts will be
treated as income from personal exertion,
and not as income from property as
under the previous Act.
(E) This definition continues the previous
Commomvealth practice except in regard to
live stock used as working beasts and
beasts of burden by primary producers. In
their case, the difficulty of identifying these
animals and also the necessity of account-
ing for any sale of the possible natural
increase, make it desirable in the interests
of simplicity to bring working beasts and
beasts of burden into the live stock schedule.
(F) The second portion of the definition
of “ mortgage ”, as set out in the previous
Act, has, in the 1936 Act, been transferred
as sub-section (5) of section 261, to which
it relates.


“non-resident” means a person who is not a resident of
Australia; (A)
“ paid ” in relation to dividends includes credited or
distributed;
“ partnership ” means an association of persons carrying on
business as partners or in receipt of income jointly, but
docs not include a company ;(B)
" person ” includes a company;
“previous Act” means the Income Tax Assessment Act 1922,
and when considered in relation to any time means that
Act, or, if it has been amended, that Act as amended as in
force at that time;
“ primary production ” means production resulting directly
from the cultivation of land or the maintenance of animals
or poultry for the purpose of selling them or their bodily
produce including natural increase, and includes the
manufacture of dairy produce by the person who produced
the raw material used in that manufacture ;(C)
“ relative ” means a husband or wife or a relation by blood,
marriage or adoption ;( E )
“ resident ” or “ resident of Australia ” means—
(a) a person, other than a company, who resides in
Australia and includes a person—
(i) whose domicile is in Australia, unless the
Commissioner is satisfied that his per-
manent place of abode is outside Aus-
tralia; or
(ii) who has actually been in Australia, con-
tinuously or intermittently, during more
than one-half of the year of income,
unless the Commissioner is satisfied that
(A) The terra “ non-resident ” has been
substituted throughout the 1036 Act for the
term “ absentee ” as used in the previous Act.
(B) Following the recommendation of
the Royal Commission on Taxation that the
purpose for which a partnership is formed
should not be the deciding factor in deter-
mining its bona fides, but that the test
should be whether, in fact, the partnership
is bona fide or fictitious, that part of the


or supplemented, or the due date for the payment of
money secured by mortgage is altered, or an extension
of time for payment is granted;
“ Absentee ” means a person who is not a resident of

the income derived from those assets, and which in the
opinion of the Commissioner was created for the purpose
of relieving that person from any liability which would
have arisen under this Act if the trust had not been
created, but does not include a company;
“ Person ” includes a company;
“ Previous Act ” means the Income Tax Assessment Act 1915
and when used in relation to any time means that Act
as in force at that time;
** Absentee “.
“ Resident ” or “ Resident of Australia ” means—
(o) a person, other than a company ■who resides in
Australia and includes a person—
(i) -whose domicile is in Australia unless the
Commissioner is satisfied that his per-
manent place of abode is outside Aus-
tralia ; or
(ii) -who has actually been in Australia, con-
tinuously or intermittently, during more
than one-half of the financial year in

business, it is income from property ;(A)
“ taxable income ” means the amount remaining after deduct-
ing from the assessable income all allowable deductions;
“taxpayer” means a person deriving income ;(B)
“ trading stock ” includes anything produced, manufactured,
acquired or purchased for purposes of manufacture, sale
or exchange, and also includes live stock;(°)
“ trustee ” in addition to every person appointed or constituted

Commonwealth Aet was the only one that
did not provide for imprisonment for this
offonee.


18. (1.) Any person may, with the leave of the Commissioner,
adopt an accounting period being the twelve months ending on some
date other than the thirtieth day of June. His accounting period
in each succeeding year shall end on the corresponding date of that
year, unless with the leave of the Commissioner some other date is
adopted.

income derived from Great Britain, where
the pound is also the unit of account, some
taxpayers have claimed the right to express
their income in British currency. The
matter is important beeaii'C of tin- present

Australian pounds.

sub-section accepted from any person returns made up in respect
of the accounting period any references in this Act to the year in

(B) “ Stock-raisin’; ” lias been deleted
from the paragraph, as it might be held to
give exemption to such bodies as racing
clubs. Pastoral interests are adequately
covered in the clause as it stands.
The reference to the carrying on of a
business by the association has been
deleted, as it might be held that societies,
such as agricultural societies, were taxable
on the income derived from their agricul-
tural shows. This was never the intention
of the law.

particular fund is being applied for the purpose for
which it was established—
(i) a provident, benefit or superannuation fund
established for the benefit of employees;
(ii) a fund established by -will or instrument of trust
for public charitable purposes; and
(iii) a fund established for the purpose of enabling
scientific research to be conducted by or in
conjunction with a public university or public
hospital;

Act 1920-1934, and wounds and disability pensions of
the kinds specified in sub-section (2.) of section sixteen
of the Finance Act 1919 of the United Kingdom;
(l) the income received by way of periodical payments in the
nature of alimony or maintenance, by a woman from her
husband or former husband: Provided that for the
purpose of making such payments the husband, or
former husband, has not divested himself of any income
producing assets, or diverted from himself income
upon which he would otherwise have been liable to
tax ;( B )

(A) Paragraph ( e) of sub-section (1) of
section 14 and sub-section (2) of section
14 —see page 65 —have been deleted because
the substance of both provisions is ade
quately covered by two other provisions in
the 1936 Act, viz.:—
(1) section 3, which continues the
taxation benefits conferred bj
the Commonwealth Debt Con
version Act and the Common
wealth Inscribed Stock Act ii
respect of Commonwealth loan
interest, and
(2) section 45, which continues the
taxation benefits conferred by
the same two Acts upon divi
dends (paid out of Common-
wealth loan interest) which were
previously exempted from tax.

which it was established;
(f) the income of any fund established for the purpose of
enabling scientific research to be conducted either by
or in conjunction with a public university or public
hospital to the extent to which the Commissioner is
satisfied that the income of the fund is being applied
for scientific research so conducted; and

decree, judgment, order or deed of separation which provides that the
husband shall periodically pay specified moneys to the wife shall not
be liable to be assessed in respect of those moneys.

primary production in the Northern Territory of Australia by a
resident of that Territory prior to the first day of July, One thousand

wealth loans are no longer Commonwealth
war loans, nor is there any prospect of
future Commonwealth loans being declared
free of Commonwealth income tax.
(B) This provision prevents double
taxation, and places payments in the nature
of alimony and separation allowance on
the same footing. The amount paid will
not be allowed as a deduction to the payor,
neither will the recipient be taxable on it.
The proviso excludes eases where a
husband or former husband creates a
trust to secure payments to be made to
the wife or former wife, and thus indirectly
obtains relief from taxation on that part
of his income payable to his wife or former
wife. In such circumstances, the recipient
will be the person taxed in respect of the
income from the trust.
(C) The definition of “ primary produc-
tion ’’ contained in section 5a (2) of the
previous Act is set out in section 6 of the
1930 Act dealing with definitions.


(n) the income derived by a resident of any Territory or
Island in the Pacific Ocean, other than New Zealand,(A)
which is governed, controlled, or held under mandate
by the Government of any part of the British Empire,
or by a condominium in which any part of the British
Empire is concerned, from the sale in Australia, by or
on behalf of that person, of produce of the Territory or
Island of which he is a resident;
(o) the income derived by a person from the working of a
mining property in Australia or in the Territory of New
Guinea principally for the purpose of obtaining gold,
or gold and copper, provided that in this case the value
of the output of gold is not less than forty per centum
of the total value of the output of the mine;( B )
(p) income derived by a bona fide prospector from the sale,
transfer or assignment by him of his rights to mine for
gold in a particular area in Australia or in the Terri-
tory of New Guinea. For the purpose of this paragraph,
“ bona fide prospector ” means a person, other than a
company, who has personally carried out the whole or
major part of the field work of prospecting for gold in
the particular area, or who has contributed to the
expenditure incurred in the work of prospecting and
development in that area, and includes a company
which has itself carried out the whole or major part of
such work;(C)
(A) The words -l other than New
Zealand ” have been inserted to make the
intention of the law clear that New
Zealand is not to be regarded as an island
in the Pacific Ocean for the purpose of the
exemption.
(B) The exemption in regard to divi-
dends contained in section 14(1) (la) has


(ii) maintenance of animals or poultry;
(iii) mining; or
(iv) fisheries,
and includes dairy produce manufactured by the
person who produced the raw material used in the
manufacture of that produce; and
( h ) “income derived from primary production” means
income which is derived directly and in the first place
from primary production.
14.—(1.) The following incomes, revenues and funds shall he
exempt from income tax: —
(n) the income derived by a resident of any Territory or
Island in the Pacific Ocean which is governed, con-
trolled, or held under mandate by the Government of
any part of the British Empire or by a condominium
in which any part of the British Empire is concerned,
from the sale in Australia by or on behalf of that
person of produce of the Territory or Island of which
he is a resident;
(la) the income derived by a person from the working of a
mining property in Australia or in the Territory of
New Guinea principally for the purpose of obtaining
gold, or gold and copper provided that in this case
the output of gold shall not be less than forty per
centum of the total value of the output of the mine—this
exemption shall extend to dividends paid by a company
out of such income;
(o) Income derived by a hona fide prospector from the sale,
transfer or assignment by him of his rights to mine for
gold in a particular area.
For the purpose of this paragraph “ hona fide pros-
pector ” means a person who has personally carried out
the whole or major part of the field work of prospecting
for gold in the particular area and includes any person,
other than a company, who has contributed to the expen-
diture incurred in the work of prospecting and develop-
ment in that area;(o)

considered that the exemption was not
justified.


( q ) income derived by a resident from sources out of Australia,
where that income is not exempt from income tax in the
country where it is derived, or where the taxpayer is
liable to pay royalty or export duty in any country
outside Australia in respect of goods from the sale of
which the income is derived. For the purposes of this
paragraph, a taxpayer shall be deemed to be liable to
pay royalty or export duty in any country outside
Australia if he satisfies the Commissioner that he sold
the goods in that country to another person for export
from that country, and that the price for which the
goods were sold was less, by the amount of the royalty
or the export duty, as the case may be, tlian the price
which the taxpayer could have obtained from the sale of
the goods outside that country ;(A)
(r) income derived by a non-resident from sources wholly out
of Australia;

(i) any fund or association maintained by a religious
institution; or
(ii) any company the whole of the shares of which
are held by or on behalf of a religious
institution,
where the fund or association is maintained, or the com-
pany was formed and is carried on, for the sole purpose
of insuring property belonging to the religious institu-
tion, and where the profits arising from the fund, or
derived by the association or company, are devoted to
that sole purpose or to the purposes of the religious
institution. (C)
24.—(1.) Where any income is exempt from income tax, the
exemption shall be limited to the specified or original recipient of
the income, and shall not extend to persons receiving payments
from that recipient, although the payments may be made wholly or
in part out of that income.l ls )
2. The exemption of any income from income tax shall not exempt
any person from furnishing any return or information which is
required by the Commissioner, or from including in his return such
information as is prescribed, or as is required by the Commissioner.
Limitation of*
exemption.
(A) This provision has been altered
to remove an anomaly which has beer
brought under notice as existing in con
nexion with the copra trade of the Man
dated Territory of New Guinea.
The actual exporter is obliged to pay an
export duty to the Government of the Man
dated Territory, and hence he was entitled
to the exemption granted by section
14 (1) (q) of the previous Act.
The actual exporter, however, usually
depresses his purchase price for the copra
by the amount of the export duty, am!
thereby transfers the burden of the duty tc
the producer. The provision will extend


SECTION 3.—EXEMPTIONS.
23. The following income shall be exempt from income tax :
* * * *
(s) the income of —
(i) any fund or association maintained by a religious institution ; or
[ii] any company the whole of the shares of which are'held by or on
behalf of a religious institution,
where the fund or association is maintained , or the company was formed
and is carried on, for the sole purpose of insuring property belonging to
the religious institution, and where the profits arising from the fund,
or derived by the association or company, are devoted to that sole purpose
or to the purposes of the religious institution.
Explanatory Note:—
Section 23 (s) of the Principal Act provided for the exemption of the income of a
company which was formed and carried on for the sole purpose of insuring property
belonging to a religious institution.
As drafted the exemption would not apply if a company, although not formed
for the purpose mentioned, had in fact carried on business in accordance with the
conditions therein set out. Section 3of the Amending Act deletes paragraph (s)
of section 23, leaving the exemption to be determined in accordance with the usual
.practice of the Taxation Department that where the income belongs in effect to a
religious institution the exemption will be granted under section 23 (e).




(g) income derived from sources outside Australia—
(i) by a resident of Australia to the extent to which
that income is, in the opinion of the Com-
missioner—
(l) not exempt from income tax in the
country in which the income was
derived; or
(2) derived from the sale of any produce
which is chargeable in the hands of
the person deriving that income with
royalty or export duty by the Govern-
ment of any country outside Aus-
tralia ; and
(ii) by a person who derives income from sources in
Australia which is subject to exemption under
paragraphs ( g ), ( h ), (I) or (p) of this sub-
section ;(B)
15. With respect to income which, under the last preceding
section, is exempt from income tax, the exemption shall be limited
to the persons specified in that section and shall not extend to the
salaries and wages of persons employed by such persons, although
such salaries and wages may be paid wholly or in part out of the
income, revenues or funds so exempt.

section do not apply in those circumstances

exemption to shareholders in respect of
dividends paid out of exempt income.


Division 2. —Income.
Subdivision A. —Assessable Income Generally.
25. —(1.) The assessable income of a taxpayer shall include—
(а) where the taxpayer is a resident—
the gross income derived directly or indirectly from all
sources whether in or out of Australia; and
(б) where the taxpayer is a non-resident —
the gross income derived directly or indirectly from all
sources in Australia,
which is not exempt income. ( A )
(2.) Interest (except interest paid outside Australia to a non-
resident on debentures issued outside Australia by a company) upon
money secured by mortgage of any property in Australia shall be
deemed to be derived from a source in Australia.
26. The assessable income of a taxpayer shall include —
(a) profit arising from the sale by the taxpayer of any
property acquired by him for the purpose of profit-
making by sale, or from the carrying on or carrying
out of any profit-making undertaking or scheme;
(b) beneficial interests in income derived under any will,
settlement, deed of gift or instrument of trust;
(c) the amount of any annuity, excluding, in the case of an
annuity which has been purchased, that part of the
annuity which represents the purchase price to the
extent to which that price has not been allowed or is not
allowable as a deduction in assessments for income tax
under this Act or any previous law of the Common-
wealth ;
( d ) five per centum of the capital amount of any allowance,
gratuity or compensation where that amount is paid in a
lump sum in consequence of retirement from, or the
termination of, any office or employment, and whether
so paid voluntarily, by agreement or by compulsion of
law: Provided that this paragraph shall not apply
in respect of any amount paid or credited by a private
company which under any provision of this Act is
deemed to be a dividend paid to the recipient;(°)
Gross Income

sources.
Certain items of
assessable
Income.
(A) This provision appears in the defi-
nition of assessable income in section 4 of
the previous act.
(B) Interest paid or credited to a person
as a depositor or debenture holder of a
company is assessable income under the
general interpretation of the word
“income”. Paragraph (6) of section 10 of
the previous Act has, therefore, been deleted
as unnecessary, but an exception of certain
interest has been set out in section 25 (2)
of the 1936 Act.


4. “ Income ” includes—
(o) interest upon money secured by mortgage of any property
in Australia; and
4. ‘‘lncome ” includes—
(ba) any profit arising from the sale by any person of any
property acquired by him for the purpose of profit-
making by sale or from the carrying on or carrying
out of any profit-making undertaking or scheme.
16. The assessable income of any person shall include—
(b) interest paid or credited to him as a depositor or debenture
holder of a company ;(B)
(c) beneficial interests in income derived under any will,
settlement, deed of gift or instrument of trust;
4. "Income” does not include—
(d) in the case of an annuity which has been purchased—
that part of the annuity which represents the purchase
price to the extent to which that price has not been
allowed or is not allowable as a deduction under the
provisions of this Act or of any Act repealed by this
Act;
•16. The assessable income of any person shall include—
(/) five per centum of the capital amount of a retiring allow-
ance or gratuity which is paid in a lump sum;
(C) The provisions of this paragraph
have been extended to include the taxation
of amounts received as compensation for
the termination of employment, as it is
considered that the consideration received
in such circumstances should be treated in
the same manner as retiring allowances and
gratuities. The proviso relates to amounts
received under the conditions set out in
section 109.


(e) the value to the taxpayer of all allowances, gratuities,
compensations, benefits, bonuses and premiums allowed,
given or granted to him in respect of, or for or in rela-
tion directly or indirectly to, any employment of or
services rendered by him, whether so allowed, given or
granted in money, goods, land, meals (A) f sustenance, the
u.se of premises or quarters! 2 ) or otherwise; Provided
that this paragraph shall not apply to any allowance,
gratuity or compensation which is included in the last
preceding paragraph or which under any provision of
this Act is deemed to be a dividend paid to the recipient;
(/) any amount received as or by way of royalty;
( g ) any bounty or subsidy received in or in relation to the
carrying on of a business, and such bounty or subsidy
shall be deemed to be part of the proceeds of that
business ;( c )
(h) the amount of any fee or commission received for procur-
ing a loan of money ;( D )
(») any amount received as or by way of bonus other than a
reversionary bonus on a policy of life assurance; and
(i) any amount received by way of insurance or indemnity
for or in respect of any loss—
(i) of trading stock which would have been taken
into account in computing taxable income; or
(ii) of profit or income which would have been assess-
able income,
if the loss had not occurred, and any amount so received
for or in respect of any loss or outgoing which is an
allowable deduction. ( E )
27.—(1.) The interest on loans raised in Australia, after the
thirty-first day of December, One thousand nine hundred qnd twenty-
three, by the government of.any country or dominion out of Australia,
or by any authority constituted by or under any law of any such
country or dominion, and received directly or indirectly by a resident,
shall be deemed to be derived by him from a source in Australia, and
shall be included in his assessable income. ( F )

(A) The word “meals” has been in-
cluded to cover allowances received in the
nature of board. It was thought that
allowances in “ sustenance ” as set out in
the previous Act covered meals supplied, hut
the High Court has determined otherwise.
It is to be remembered that the cost of
such meals is an allowable deduction to
the employer.
(B) The section has been amended to
assess an employee in respect of the rental
value of a residence provided by an
employer for the use of the employee.
Under the previous Act, an employee was
not liable in respect of such an allowance for
residence or quarters unless a specific
deduction on that account was made from
his salary or wages or unless the employee
had the right to let the premises and thus
convert the advantage into money. It Is
considered that income tax should be based
upon the true remuneration of employment,
including subsidiary benefits arising out of
such employment.
It is to be noted that the value to be
assessed is the value to the taxpayer. In
the case of a residence this would normally
he the annual rental value. In the absence
of evidence of rental value a reasonable
percentage of the capital value would be
adopted. If a residence in excess of the
requirements of the employee were provided,
the full rental value would not be assessed,
but only the amount which represented the
value to the employee.
In regard to quarters the value fixed
under arbitration awards will, generally
speaking, be adopted.
The proviso refers to amounts received
under the conditions set out in section 109.


( g ) all allowances, gratuities (except retiring allowances and
gratuities paid in lump sums), bonuses and premiums
whether in money or goods or sustenance or land
allowed, given or granted to a person in respect of or for
or in relation, directly or indirectly, to any employment
or service of such person to the amount of the value
of such allowances, gratuities, bonuses and premiums
respectively; and
( d ) money derived by way of royalty . . .
(d) money derived by way of .. . bonus . . .
25. A deduction shall not, in any case, be made in respect of any
of the following matters; —
(c) any loss or expense which is recoverable under any
contract of insurance or indemnity;
(C) In the definition section, bounties
have been included as income from personal
exertion. The inclusion of bounties in
paragraph (g) is intended to make
it clear that such bounties are assess-
able income, and further, that they are
to be deemed to be part of the proceeds of
the business and subject to the same
apportionment (if any) between Australia
and ex-Australia as the proceeds of the
business are subject to.
(D) This paragraph provides for the in-
clusion of procuration fees as assessable
income. A provision is also included in
section 67 to allow a deduction of expen-
diture incurred in borrowing money used
for the production of assessable income.
Procuration fees have been held to bo
capital expenditure, but there is no good
reason why they should not be treated for
taxation in the same manner as interest
paid in connexion with the borrowing of
money.
(E) The provision in the previous Act in
section 25 (c) was in the negative form, a
deduction not being allowed of a loss
covered by insurance. It is considered
preferable to allow a deduction in the ordi-
nary course of a loss which is otherwise
allowable, whether or not covered by in-
surance, and to bring to account as income
any amount received by way of insurance
in respect of that loss.
(F) This section repeats the substance of
section 5 of the Taxation of Loans Act
1923, which latter section is repealed by
section 2 of the 1930 Act.


(2.) For the purposes of this section, a loan shall, be deemed to
have been raised in Australia if subscriptions to the loan were invited
in Australia by public advertisement, by the issue of a prospectus,
or otherwise.
Subdivision B.—Trading Stock.
28. (1.) Where a taxpayer carries on any business, the value,
ascertained under this sub-division, of all trading stock on hand at
the beginning of the year of income, and of all trading stock on hand
at the end of that year shall be taken into account in ascertaining
whether or not the taxpayer has a taxable income. ( A )
(2.) Where the value of all trading stock on hand at the end of
the year of income exceeds the value of all trading stock on hand at
the beginning of that year, the assessable income of the taxpayer shall
include the amount of the excess.
(3.) Where the value of all trading stock on hand at the begin-
ning of the year of income exceeds the value of all trading stock on
hand at the end of that year, the amount of the excess shall be
an allowable deduction.
29. The value of live stock and of each article of other trading
stock to be taken into account at the beginning of the year of income
shall be its value as ascertained under this or the previous Act at the
i>nd of the year immediately preceding the year of income. (A)
30. (1.) Where the value of live stock at the beginning of the
year of income, as ascertained for the purpose of assessment to income
tax under the law of a State, differs from its corresponding value as
ascertained under the last preceding section, and it appears to the
Trading stock

Value at

Where
Commonwealth
and State
values differ.
(A) Sections 28 and 20 effect an altera-
tion in the assessment of Primary Pro-
ducers, in that they make it compulsory
for all live stock on hand at the beginning
and at the end of a year to be brought to
account. The previous Act in section 16 (aa)
permitted a Primary Producer to elect t<
omit from his stock on hand all natural in-
crease bred by him until such natura'
increase was disposed of. There is a very
limited number of taxpayers who
have so elected to omit the natura'
increase, and the recommendation of
the Royal Commission was that the
provision be deleted from the Common-
wealth Act in the interests of simplicity
and uniformity. The change over will not
involve the Primary Producers concerned
in any increase of income, as any amount
included in an assessment in respect of
such live stock on hand at the end of the
year will bo offset by a corre^noudim


16. The assessable income of any person shall include—
(o) profits derived from any trade or business and converted
into stock-in-trade or added to the capital of or in any
way invested in the trade or business:
Provided that for the purpose of computing such
profits the value of all live stock (not being live stock
used as beasts of burden or as working beasts), and
trading stock (not being live stock), not disposed of at
the beginning and end of the period in which the income
was derived shall be taken into account except where
the person otherwise elects, as provided in paragraph
( aa ) of this section:
(i) Provided that the value adopted in relation
to any article of trading stock as the value of
of that article as at the end of the period in
which the income was derived, shall, for the
purposes of the assessment of the person’s
income derived in the next succeeding period,
be deemed to be the value of that article as
at the commencement of that next succeeding
period; and
(ii) Provided that the value adopted in relation
to any live stock, as the value of that live
stock, as at the end of the period in which the
income was derived, shall, for the purposes
of the assessment of the person’s income
derived in the next succeeding period, be
deemed to be the value of that- live stock as
at the commencement of the next succeeding
period:
amount in respect of the number of similar
live stock on hand at the beginning of the
year. Provision is made in section 35 for
this class of Primary Producer to select r
value for such natural increase within the
limits from which he could have previously
made a selection.
Beasts of burden and working beasts
must be taken into account in the live
stock schedule by all live’ stock owners
engaged in primary production (see note
(e) to section G on page 15). In those cases
where the animals in question have pre-
viously been included in the depreciation
schedule, the opening value will be their
written down or depreciated value —vide
section 29. If the animals are natural
increase not previously included in the
depreciation schedule, they should be
brought to account in the live stock
schedule in the same manner as other
natural increase owned by tbe taxpayer.


Commissioner that, if those values were equal, the corresponding
values would remain equal in subsequent years, the taxpayer may,
subject to this section, take his live stock into account at the beginning
of the year of income at a value equal to its corresponding value
under the law of the State. ( A )
(2.) Where the value at which that live stock is taken into account
at the beginning of the year of income exceeds the value as ascer-
tained under the last preceding section, amounts in the aggregate
equal to the excess shall be included in the assessable income of the
taxpayer of one or more of the years being the year of income and the
four years next succeeding that year.
(3.) Where the value of live stock as ascertained under the last
preceding section exceeds its value as taken into account at the
beginning of the year of income, amounts in the aggregate equal to
the excess shall be deducted from the assessable income of the tax-
payer of one or more of the years being the year of income and the
four years next succeeding that year.
(4.) The amounts referred to in sub-sections (2.) and (3.) of this
section and the years in respect of which they are to be taken into
account, shall be such amounts and years as are agreed upon by the
taxpayer and the Commissioner, and unless and until those amounts
and years are so agreed upon, this section shall not apply to the
assessment of that taxpayer.
31. The value of each article of trading stock (not being live
stock) to be taken into account at the end of the year of income shall
be, at the option of the taxpayer, its cost price or market selling value
or the price at which it can be replaced.
32. The value of live stock to be taken into account at the end of
the year of income shall be, at the option of the taxpayer, its cost
price or market selling value, and where a taxpayer does not exercise
his option within the time and in the manner prescribed, the value so
to be taken into account shall be the cost price :(E)
Value at end of
year of Income,
Value of lire
stock at end of
year of Income.
(A) Owing to the varying provisions of
Commonwe-alth and State Laws regarding
the method of treating live stock for assess-
ment purposes it will be obvious that the
values of the live stock on hand at the time
the new Act came into force must in most
eases be different for Commonwealth and
State returns. In order to get the values
into line without prejudicing the taxpayer
or one of the Departments concerned, it
was necessary to formulate some arbitrary
provision to effect the desired result. This
has been done by allowing the taxpayer
himself to decide which of the two values,
the Commonwealth or the State, he desires
to retain. If the decision means that in
one of the returns the taxpayer writes up
the_ value of his live stock on hand at the
beginning of the year and thereby reduces
his income, the provision is that there shall
be added to his income in the assessment
of the one Department affected, an amount
equivalent to the increase in such live
stock value. This amount can bo spread
over one to five years in such instalments
as he and the Commissioner may agree
upon. If the difference is small, the tax-
payer will probably desire the adjustment
completely made in one year. Similarly if
the decision means that the taxpayer writes
down the value of his live stock and thereby
increases his income, a corresponding
deduction is to be conceded over the same
period of years.
In this way the values of live stock
on hand at the inception of the Com-
monwealth and State uniform Acts can
he brought into lino without prejudicing
either the revenue or the taxpayer.


For the purposes of this paragraph “ Value ” means—
-16. (a) (i) in the case of trading stock (not being live stock)
—the actual cost price or market settling value
of each article of trading stock, or the price
at which each article of trading stock can be
replaced, at the option of the person in respect
of each article:
16. (a) (ii) in the case of live stock (not being live stock used
as beasts of burden or as working beasts) —the
cost price or market selling price at the option
of the person which shall be exercised by notice
in writing signed by him and delivered by him
It is to be noted that this provision is not
a compulsory one, but is left optional to
the taxpayer. If he prefers to continue
with the present arrangement whereby both
he and the Department are bound to keep
two sets of live stock accounts for Com-
monwealth and State purposes he is at
liberty to do so. He may, of course, prefer
to maintain two differing sets of values
temporarily, till such time as the varying
number of his live stock makes the tran-
sition an easier one. The onus is placed
entirely upon the taxpayer to decide
whether he wants the simplification and
uniformity in his return by adopting one
set of figures.
(B) The only variation from the previous
practice made in this section is a provision
that if the taxpayer fails to exercise his
option, the Department adopts the cost
price. This is the value that most tax-
payers elect. In the administration of euch
sections as this a great deal of time and
postal expense has been wasted because of
the indifference of taxpayers to Depart-
mental communications. The provision
inserted will automatically bring any
delay to a definite conclusion by imposing
a time limit. See regulation 5.
In the case of taxpayers who have made
an election under the previous Act as to
the basis of valuation of their live stock,
the section does not give them any auto-
matic right to a new election, as, under
section 33, where live stock has been pre-
viously taken into account the basis then
adopted must be continued, unless altered
with the leave of the Commissioner.


Provided that, where a taxpayer satisfies the Commissioner that
there are circumstances which justify the adoption by him of some
value other than cost price or market selling value for the whole or
part of his live stock, he may, with the leave of the Commissioner,
adopt that other value. (A)
33. A taxpayer shall not, except with the leave of the Commis-
sioner, adopt a basis of valuation of his live stock taken into account
at the end of the year of income different from the basis on which the
valuation of his live stock was made when it was last taken into
account at the end of a previous year, whether under this or the
previous Act. ( B )
34. —(1.) The cost price per head of natural increase of any
’ class of live stock of a taxpayer shall be—
(a) where the cost price of natural increase of that class has
been previously taken into account under this Act by
the taxpayer—the cost price per head at which natural
increase of that class was last taken into account unless,
with the leave of the Commissioner, the taxpayer selects
another cost price ;(°) and
( b ) where the cost price of natural increase of that class has
not been previously taken into account under this Act
by the taxpayer —the cost price selected by him within
the limits prescribed in respect of live stock of that
class. ( D )
(2.) Where a taxpayer does not so select within the time and in
the manner prescribed he shall be deemed to have selected, as the
cost price, the lower of the prescribed limits. ( E >

natural Increase.
(A) This is a now provision .which makes
it possible for a taxpayer with the Com-
missioner’s consent to adopt a value other
than cost or market. The occasion for this
only arises in particular circumstances;
e.g. a trust estate where, for trust
accountancy purposes, probate values have
to be retained; or a taxpayer, adopting a
uniform standard value.
(B) This is a now provision to give
greater elasticity than previously existed for
a taxpayer to change his basis of values. An
occasion for such a change might arise
when a partnership is created and the
various members desire to change from
market to cost, or vice versa. Provided
(he Commissioner is satisfied that the reason
is a genuine one and that the revenue will
not be prejudiced by the change, the neccs-
iiary leave would bo readily given.
(C) This section also gives greater elas-
ticity than did the previous Act by making
it possible in the future for a taxpayer to
change his selected value for natural
increase with the Commissioner’s consent.
The consent would not be withheld unless
revenue would be prejudiced by the change-
(D) The effect of this paragrapli is to give
every live stock owner who did not elect to
omit natural increase and who has adopted
cost price as the basis of valuation, the
right of a new selection for the cost price
of any future natural increase. A new
range of values has been agreed upon by
the Commonwealth and State representa-
tives of the Taxation Conferences with a
view to obtaining uniformity between the
Commonwealth and States. The previous
and new ranges as affecting the Common-
wealth taxpayers are:—


at the office of the Commissioner on or before
the prescribed date.
Provided also that any option exercised in
pursuance of this sub-paragraph for the pur-
poses of an assessment for the financial year
beginning on the first day of July One
thousand nine hundred and twenty-four or any
subsequent year, shall be irrevocable and shall,
if the person, in the notice of his option, so
requires, apply to the assessment of his income
tax for the financial year beginning on the
first day of July One thousand nine hundred
and twenty-three and shall apply to the assess-
ment of the person’s income derived in the
period in respect of which the option is
exercised and to assessments in respect of all
subsequent periods;
16. (a) (ii) The cost price in relation to natural increase of
live stock shall be the value per head of the live stock selected by
the person within the limits prescribed and the value so selected shall
be used for the purposes of the assessment of the financial year
beginning on the first day of July One thousand nine hundred and
twenty-three and of all subsequent years:

The new ranges have now been prescribed
by regulations (regulation 5 (3.) ). The pro-
visions in sections 32, 33 and 34 are clastic
enough to permit of any primary producer
using a value for his natural increase even
lower or higher than the limits prescribed,
when the facts are such that a lower or
higher price can be established. In the
case of stud live stock it has always been
the practice of the Department to concede
a higher value where such is asked for.
Nothing in this section is to be taken
to override section 29, which provides for
the value at the beginning of tho year of
income to be the closing value of the im-
mediately preceding year. The new elec-
tion of a cost price applies only to natural
increase born during and after the first
year of income to which the 1930 Act
applies.
Live stock owners who un.ler the previous
Act elected to omit natural incrca-e and
adopted cost price as the basis of valuation
are provided for under section 35 (2) {&)
and section 35 (3).
(E) The need for the insertion of this
time limit is the same as explained in
the notes to section 32. Page 49.


35. —(1.) Where under the previous Act, a taxpayer elected to
omit from the account of his stock-in-trade the value of natural
increase of his live stock, the value of the natural increase omitted
in pursuance of that election and on hand at the beginning of the
first year to the income of which this Act applies, shall be taken
into account in ascertaining the value of trading stock on hand at the
beginning of that year. (A)'
(2.) The value at which natural increase shall be so taken into
account shall be—
(a) where the taxpayer had exercised under the previous
Act an option to value live stock at market selling
price—the market selling price as at the beginning
of the year;
( b ) where the taxpayer had exercised under the previous
Act an option to value live stock at cost price—a value
per head selected by the taxpayer, within the limits
prescribed, as cost price for natural increase under the
previous Act, by regulations in force immediately
preceding the commencement of this Act, or where he
does not so select within the time and in the manner
prescribed—the lower of those prescribed limits.
(3.) The value per head ascertained as the cost price of natural
increase under paragraph (6) of sub-section (2.) of this section
shall, unless altered with the leave of the Commissioner, apply also
to natural increase of the first year of income to which this Act
applies and of all subsequent years:
Provided that the value per head of natural increase of the first
year of income to which this Act applies and of all subsequent years
shall not be less than the lower of the limits prescribed under this
Act in respect of the value to be selected as the cost price of natural
increase.
36. (1.) Subject to this section, where the whole or any part
of the assets of a business carried on by a taxpayer is disposed of
by sale or otherwise howsoever, whether for the purpose of putting
an end to the business or any part thereof or not, and the assets
disposed of include any property being trading stock, standing or
growing crops or crop-stools, the value of that property shall be
included in his assessable income, and any person acquiring that
Omission of
natural increase
under previous
Act.
Disposal of
business. a
(A) Tin l reason for tlie insertion of this
section is explained in the notes to sections
28 and 29. It is intended to place the
primary producer, who previously did not
take the natural increase into account, on
the same footing for future years with the
primary producer who did. Since he has
now to bring his natural increase to account,
provision has been made to give him a
deduction for natural increase brought
forward at the time of changing over,
since to include in the assessment natural
increase on hand at the end of the
year without at the same time giving
a deduction for the natural increase on
hand at the beginning of the year, would
"result in assessing such a primary pro-
ducer on more than a normal year’s income.
As far as possible, however, he is to be
put in no bettor position than the primary
producer who formerly did bring his natural
increase to account. If. under the previous
Act, his election was, for his other
live stock, to use the cost price, the range
of values from which his selection is to
be made for natural increase, is limited


16. (aa) Notwithstanding anything contained in paragraph (a)
of this section, an owner of live stock may elect to
omit from the account required by that paragraph the
value of all natural increase of live stock owned by
him, and born during the year in which the income
is derived, and shall not be assessed for income tax
in respect of that natural increase except to the
extent to which he has disposed of it. The owner
of the live stock shall give notice of his election, in
writing, in the prescribed form signed by him, and
deliver it at the office of the Commissioner on or
before the prescribed date. The election' specified in
any notice given in pursuance of this paragraph for
the purposes of an assessment for the financial year
beginning on the first day of July One thousand nine
hundred and twenty-four or any subsequent year
shall be irrevocable, and shall, if the owner in the
notice of his election so* requires, apply to the assess-
ment of his income tax for the financial year begin-
ning on the first day of July One thousand nine
hundred and twenty-three and shall apply to the
assessment of income derived in the period in repect
of which the election is made and to assessments for
all subsequent periods. Any live stock acquired by
any person by the natural increase of his stock, which
natural increase ifae person nas elected to omit from
the account required by paragraph (a) of this section,
shall not be brought to account until the year in
which that natural increase of the live stock so
acquired is sold or otherwise disposed or by the
person;
16. ( h ) in the case of any person who sells or otherwise disposes
of to another person (otherwise than by way of
testamentary disposition)
(a) either as a whole or in separate parts, the
whole of the assets of a business carried on
by him, for the purposes of putting an end
to the business; or
to ‘the same range that existed under
the previous Art. lie is not to be
given the option of any further
selection from the new range of cost prices
for natural increase as is the ca r e of other
live stock owners. The value of the
natural increase of the first year of income
to which the 1030 Act applies is not, how-
ever, to be less than the lower of the new
range of values.
If his election under the previous Act was
to use market values and not the cost
price, he is to continue with market values
for all his live stock, including natural in-
crease previously omitted.
It will still, however, be permissible for
him under sections 32 and 34 to alter his
selected value for the cost price of natural
increase born after the commencement of
the new Act or to alter the basis generally
of the value for all his live stock, for any
good and sufficient reasons, if the Com-
missioner approves of the change, as
explained in the notes to the preceding
sections.


property shall be deemed to have purchased it at the amount of that
value. ( A )
(2.) Where a taxpayer, after the beginning of the first year to
the assessment of the income of which this Act applies, sells the
whole of a business carried on by him—
(а) for the purpose of putting an end to that business; or
(б) in consequence of the acquisition or resumption of land,
used by him for that business, under the provisions of
any Act or State Act which contains provisions for
the compulsory acquisition or resumption of laud,
the value of any live stock included in the sale, being natural
increase bred by him which was on hand at the beginning of that
first year, and which was, in the opinion of the Commissioner,
ordinarily used by him in that business for breeding purposes, shall
not be included in his assessable income, and no deduction shall be
allowed to him in respect of any such live stock, and no such live
stock shall be taken into account in computing his taxable income.( B >
(3.) For the purposes of this section, the value of any property
or live stock shall be —
(а) the price specified in any contract of sale or arrangement
as the price at which it was disposed of; or
(б) if a price is not so specified in any such contract or
arrangement—
(i) the market value of the property or live stock on
the day of the disposal; or
(ii) if in the opinion of the Commissioner there is
insufficient evidence of the market value on
that day—the value which in his opinion is
fair and reasonable.
(A) Tlie variations from the previous
Act covered by this section are:—■
(i) Growing crops and crop-stools are
brought into the category of
trading stock in the case of sale
or disposal. This results in the
purchaser obtaining a deduction
lor the purchase price as well as
the vendor being taxed upon it.
(ii) Assets in the nature of trading
stock disposed of by testamen-
tary disposition are specifically
dealt with in section 37.
(iii) In a business of primary produc-
tion working beasts and beasts
of burden are treated as trading
stock—see definition of “ live
stock ” in section 0.
(iv) The exemption relating to profits
made on the sale of live stock
used for breeding purposes is
withdrawn.
The removal of the exemption under (iv)
above is in accordance with the recom-
mendation of the Royal Commission, which
gave vorj' serious consideration to this item
of the exemption in the interests of Com-
monwealth and State uniformity. The
Royal Commission pointed out that when
breeding stock is sold in the ordinary
course of business, the proceeds of the sale
are included in the taxpayer’s assessable
income in the usual manner. The exemp-
tion of profit on the sale of breeding stock
sold for the purpose of putting an end
to a business, or a part of a business, rests
on the argument that the breeding stock
is equivalent to plant, and that when the
breeding stock is sold, the proceeds repre-
sent the realisation of a capital asset. To
this the Royal Commission replies that
when the breeding stock is purchased, the
purchase cost is allowed as a deduction;
similarly in the case of breeding stock,
which is bred by the taxpayer, he receives
a deduction of the working expenses of the
station property incurred in rearing live
stock. The view of the Royal Commission
is that live stock possesses the

36.—(1.) Subject to this section, where the whole or any part of the assets of a
business carried on by a taxpayer is disposed of by sale or otherwise howsoever,
whether for the purpose of putting an end to the business or any part thereof or not,
and the assets disposed of include any property being trading stock, standing or
growing crops or crop-stools, the value of that property shall be included in his
assessable income, and any person acquiring that property shall be deemed to have
purchased it at the amount of that value.
(2.) Where a taxpayer, after the beginning of the first year to the assessment
of the income of which this Act applies sells the whole of a business carried on by
him
(a) for the purpose of putting an end to that business ; or
(b) in consequence of the acquisition or resumption of land, used by him for
that business, under the provisions of any Act or State Act which
contains provisions for the compulsory acquisition or resumption
of land,
the value of any live stock included in the sale being natural increase bred by him
which was on hand at the beginning of that first year, and which was, in the opinion
of the Commissioner, ordinarily used by him in that business for breeding purposes,
shall not be included in his assessable income, and no deduction shall be allowed to
him in respect of any such live stock, and no such live stock shall be taken into
account in computing his taxable income.
(3.) For the purposes of this section, the value of any property or live stock
shall be—
(a) the 'price specified in any contract of sale or arrangement as the price at
which it teas disposed of; or
(b) if a price is not so specified in any such contract or arrangement —
(i) the market value of the property or live stock on the day of
the disposal; or
(ii) if in the opinion of the Commissioner there is insufficient
evidence'of the market value on that day—the value which
in his opinion is fair and reasonable.
Explanatory Note:—
This amendment gives effect to the adoption of a recommendation by Sir David
Ferguson, Chairman of the Eoyal Commission on Taxation.
The amendment made to the lease provisions to exclude wholly or partly from
assessable income the consideration received for the sale or surrender of leases of
Crown land would, if the amendment to section 36 (3.) had not been made, provide
a means for the evasion of tax.
Section 36 (3.) as it stood, without the amendment, bound the Commissioner
on a walk-in walk-out sale to the allocation by the parties of the purchase
money. As the consideration for the lease will be either wholly or partly
non-assessable income, there would he a strong temptation to allocate in the contract
a high price for the lease, thereby reducing the assessable proceeds from the sale
of live-stock. The amendment to section 36 (3.) obviates this risk of loss of revenue.




(&) part of the assets of a business carried on by
him, for the purpose of putting an end to
a part of the business; or
(c) any assets of a business, carried on by him,
for any purpose not mentioned in the last
two preceding sub-paragraphs,
and the assets so sold or disposed of included any
trading stock or live stock (not being live stock which,
in the opinion of the Commissioner or a Deputy
Commissioner, were ordinarily used by that person as
beasts of burden or as working beasts)
(1) if an amount has been specified in any contract
of sale or in any other arrangement as the
price at which such trading stock or live
stock was sold or otherwise disposed of—
the amount so specified;
(2) if an amount has not been specified in any
contract of sale or in any other arrangement
as the price at which such trading stock or
live stock was sold or otherwise disposed
of —
the market value of the trading stock
or live stock ruling on the day on which
the sale or other disposal was made; or
(3) if the provisions of item (1) of this paragraph
are not applicable, and the Commissioner is
of the opinion that there is no evidence or
that there is insufficient evidence of the
characteristics of a fixed asset and a trad-
in" asset, and though an animal may be
acquired primarily for breeding or wool-
growing purposes, its ultimate sale is by no
means a minor consideration. No justifica-
tion therefore exists for a continuance of
the concession, as in all cases the full cost
of every head of stock purchased or reared
has been allowed as a deduction, and the
recommendation of the Royal Commission
is that the proceeds of breeding stock sold
upon the realization or discontinuance of
a business, from any cause whatsoever,
should be included in the assessable income
of the taxpayer. The profit on the trading
stock realized by a merchant in similar
circumstances is not exempted from taxa-
tion. The State Ministers in conference
all supported the recommendation of the
Royal Commission.
The elasticity provided by the revised
live-stock sections has been made possible
only on the assumption that the ultimate
profit or loss on the sale of live-stock would
ho brought to account.
(B) This sub-section provides a limited
continuation of the present concession of
exempting the profit on the sale of
breeding stock disposed of for the
purpose of putting an end to a business.
The concession is limited in its application
to live stock used for breeding purposes,
which are the natural increase bred by the
taxpayer and on hand at the beginning of
the first year to which the 1930 Act applies.
The insertion of the sub-section is to
remove any hardship which might
be caused to a grazier who, by
reason of the selection of a low value for
natural increase in the light of the past
exemption, might be assessed on an exces-
sive income in one year, as the result of a
clearing-out sale. The sub-section will cease
to have any effect so soon as the natural
increase on hand at the beginning of the
first year are no longer in existence, or
have been sold by the taxpayer. Sections
34 and 35 give a taxpayer the right of
selecting a higher value for future natural
increase if he desires if.

who has so sold or disposed of assets for the purpose
of putting an end to the whole of a business carried
on by him, or in consequence of the acquisition or
resumption of land, used by him for a business carried
on by him, under the provisions of any law of the
Commonwealth or a State which contains provision
for the compulsory acquisition or resumption of land,
shall not include any amount in respect of any live
stock, included in the assets so sold or disposed of
which, in the opinion of the Commissioner or a
Deputy Commissioner, w r ere ordinarily used by that
person for breeding purposes except that, when such
live stock includes sheep in the wool, there shall be
included in the assessable income of that person the
amount which, if the provisions of sub-sections (2.)
and (3.) of section seventeen of this Act were applied,
would be or would be deemed to be the price or value
of flic wool as r’islinct from the sheep, (A) but not ex-
ceeding the excess, if any, of the sale price of the sheep
in the wool over the value at which those sheep were
brought to account at the end of the year imme-
diately preceding that in which the sale took place or,
if they were purchased after the end of that year,
over the purchase price of those sheep:
Provided further that, notwithstanding anything
contained in this section or in section twenty-three of
this Act, no deduction shall be allowed'to any person
on account of live stock sold or disposed of by him
in respect of which, by virtue of the last preceding
proviso, any amount has been excluded from his
assessable income.

devolve by reason of his death, and those assets include any property
being trading stock, standing or growing crops, or crop-stools, the
value of that property shall, subject to this Act, be included in the
assessable income derived by the deceased up to the date of his death,
and the person upon whom the property devolves shall be deemed

(A) This section sets out more spocili-
cally than did the previous Act the pro-
visions for the value of trading stock to
be taken into account on the death of a
taxpayer. The market, i.e., the probate,
values are to be applied to the closing
values of trading stock in the return of
the deceased taxpayer, and the probate
values are also to be used as the opening
values for the trustees and beneficiaries.

other manner in the case of a disposal otherwise than by sale as
the price or value at which the sheep have been sold or disposed

specified, the sale price shall be deemed to be the market value of
similar sheep off shears ruling on the day on which the sale or
disposal was made, or, if the Commissioner is of the opinion that
there is no evidence, or that there is insufficient evidence, of such
market value, the sale price shall be deemed to be the amount
which, in the opinion of the Commissioner, fairly represents that
market value.
(3.) The sale price of the wool as distinct from, the sheep shall
be or shall be deemed to be the difference between the sale price
of the sheep as distinct from the wool as ascertained in accordance
with the provisions of sub-section (2.) of this section and—
(a) in the case of a sale —the sale price of the sheep in the
wool; or
(5) in the case of a disposal otherwise than by sale —the
market value of the sheep in the wool ruling on the day
on which the disposal was made as ascertained by the
Commissioner, or, if the Commissioner is of the opinion
that there is no evidence, or that there is insufficient
evidence, of such market value, the amount which, in
the opinion of the Commissioner, fairly represents that
market value.

(B) Sections 38 to 40 "were inserted in the
Act for the purpose of standardization with
the States, and to make explicit what was
previously implicit in the Commonwealth
law. The insertion of these sections brings
into existence no new principle or practice,
since the previous Commonwealth principles
applied for determining the quantum of
taxable profit were governed by the various
Court decisions in leading cases, to which
these sections have been made to conform.
(C) This section follows the recommen-
dations of the Royal Commission for the
purpose of determining when a non-resident
trader, operating through an agent, should
be regarded as carrying on business in Aus-
tralia. Under the various State Taxation
Laws the non-resident trader is held liable
for tax in this manner on all the sales made
through the instrumentality of his agent.
It is considered equitable that the non-
resident trader, operating through a branch
established in Australia, should be in no


SECTION S.—DEVOLUTION ON DEATH.
37.—(1.) Where the assets of a business carried on by a taxpayer devolve by
reason of his death, and those assets include any property being trading stock,
standing or growing crops, or crop-stools, the value of that property shall, subject
to this Act, be included in the assessable income derived by the deceased up to the
date of his death, and the person upon whom the property devolves shall be deemed
to have purchased it at that value.
(2.) For the purpose of the last preceding sub-section, the value of the property
so to be included shall be the amount which would have been included in respect
of that property in the assessable income of the deceased' person, under the last
preceding section, if he had not died but had disposed of the property on the day of
his death for the purpose of putting an end to the whole of a business carried on by
him and without any price being specified in any contract or arrangement:

more disadvantageous position as regards
taxation, than the non-resident trader
operating through an agent whether resi-
dent or transient. The previous Common-
wealth practice, though not expressly set
out in the law, depended upon two out of
the following three factors occurring in
Australia:—
(o) Place of contract,
(6) Place of delivery,
(e) Place of payment.
The Commonwealth test was laid down
during the war to meet the difficulties of
Australian representatives of Empire busi-
nesses trading with Australia in competition
with foreign countries. It was based upon
decisions of the English Courts. It is quite
obvious that by arranging for two out of
three factors to take place outside
Australia, taxation could be avoided, and
for this reason the teat of “ instrumen-
tality ” adopted by the States is considered
preferable.


42. In any case, not specified in the preceding sections of this
subdivision, where—
(a) by reason of the manufacture, production, or purchase of
goods in one country and their sale in another;
(Z>) by reason of successive steps of production or manufac-
ture in different countries; or
(c) by reason of the making of contracts in one country and
their performance in another,
or for any other reason whatever, a question arises whether any, and
if so what part, of any profit is derived by a person from sources
in Australia, the question shall be determined in accordance
with the regulations, or if there is no regulation applying to the
case, shall be determined by the Commissioner.
43. —(1.) The assessable income of a taxpayer shall include any
profit derived by him in the year of income which, under the pro-
visions of this subdivision, is derived or deemed to be derived in Aus-
tralia and the proceeds of any sale to which this subdivision applies
.shall not otherwise he included in his assessable income.( A )
(2.) No amount taken into account in ascertaining any such profit,
and no expenditure incurred directly or indirectly in or in relation to
any such sale, shall be an allowable deduction.
Subdivision D. — Dividends.
44. —(1.) The assessable income of a shareholder in a company
(whether the company is a resident or a non-resident) shall, subject
to this section —
(а) if he is a resident—include dividends paid to him by the
company out of profits derived by it from any source;
and
(б) if he is non-resident—include dividends paid to him by the
company to the extent to which they are paid out of
profits derived by it from sources in Australia,
(2.) The assessable income of a shareholder shall not include
dividends —
(a) received from a company that does not carry on business
in, or derive income from sources in, Australia;
(b) paid wholly and exclusively out of one or more of the
following:—(B)
(i) income derived from sources outside Australia,

previous Act is or has been assessable income
of the company;

their performance in another,
or for any other reason whatever, income is derived partly from,
sources outside Australia, the question whether any, and if so what
part, of the income is derived from sources outside Australia shall
be determined in accordance with the regulations, or, if there is no
regulation applying to the case, shall be determined by the Commis-
sioner.

Rebate on
dividends.
46. (1.) Subject to this section, a shareholder shall be entitled
to a rebate in his assessment of the amount obtained by applying
to that part of the dividends which is included in his taxable income
a rate equivalent to—
(a) the rate of tax payable by him on income from property;
or
(b) the rate of tax payable by companies for the year of tax,
whichever is the less.
(2.) In determining the rate of rebate any special property tax
shall not b? taken into account. (A)
(3.) The part of the dividends so included in the taxable income
of the shareholder shall be the amount remaining after deducting
from the amount of dividends included in his assessable income
deductions allowable to him under this Act from income from
dividends.
(4.) A shareholder in a company which is a co-operative company
within the meaning of Division 9 of this Part shall not be entitled
to a rebate in his assessment in respect of dividends paid to him
by that company. ( B )
47. —(1.) Distributions to shareholders of a company by a
liquidator in the course of winding up the company, to the extent
to which they represent income derived by the company (whether
before or during liquidation) other than income which has been
properly applied to replace a loss of paid-up capital, shall, for the
purposes of this Act, be deemed to be dividends paid to the share-
holders by the company out of profits derived by it.
(2.1 Those distributions shall, to the extent to which they are
made out of any profits or income, be deemed to have been paid
wholly and exclusively out of those profits or that income.
Division 3. —Deductions.
48. In calculating the taxable income of a taxpayer, the total
assessable income derived by him during the year of income shall
be taken as a basis, and from it there shall be deducted all allowable
deductions.
49. Where by this Act it is provided that any deduction shall be
made successively from two or more classes of income, the deduction
shall be set off against the income of the first of those classes, and
if it exceeds the income of that class the excess shall be set off against
the income of the second class, and so on until either the deduction
or the income of the last of those classes is exhausted.

(A) Special property tax is not taken
into account because, in the Rates Act, in
which the special property tax is imposed,
provision is made to prevent double taxa-
tion in respect of that tax—not by a rebate
but by exempting a shareholder from the
special property tax in respect of that part
of his taxable income which represents in-
come upon which the special property tax
was paid in the hands of a company.
This treatment is possible because the
rate of the special property tax is a flat
one —a fixed percentage—whereas normal
tax is assessed at a graduated rate. For
normal tax purposes, therefore, dividends
must be taxed to the shareholder at the


SECTION 6.—REBATE ON DIVIDENDS.
46.—(1.) Subject to this section, a shareholder shall be entitled to a rebate
in his assessment of the amount obtained by applying to that part of the dividends
which is included in his taxable income a rate equivalent to —
(а) the rate of tax payable by him on income from property or
(б) the rate of tax payable by companies for the year of tax,
whichever is the less.
[2.) In determining the rate of rebate any special property tax shall not be taken into
account.
Explanatory Note:—
This amendment removes one of the special property tax provisions from
the Principal Act.




16ab. —(1.) A shareholder shall be entitled to a rebate in his
assessment of the amount obtained by applying to that part of the

shall not be taken into account.
(3.) The part of the dividends so included in the taxable income
of the shareholder shall be the amount remaining after deducting
from the amount of dividends included in his assessable income the
deductions allowable to him under this Act from income from
dividends.
16b. — (1.) Amounts distributed to shareholders of a company
by a liquidator in the course of winding up the company, to the
extent to which they represent income derived by the company
(whether before or during liquidation) other than income which has
been properly applied to replace a loss of paid-up capital, shall, for
the purposes of this Act, be deemed to be dividends paid to the
shareholders by the company.
(2.) Any amount deemed, under the last preceding sub-section,
.to be a dividend, shall, to the extent to which it represents any
income or profits specified, in paragraph (b) of sub-section (2.) of
section sixteen aa of this Act be deemed, for the purposes of that
sub-section to be a dividend paid wholly and exclusively out of
that income or those profits.

50. Where the assessable income is derived from more than one
of the following classes of income, that is to say, income from personal
exertion, income from property other than dividends, and income
from dividends, the following provisions shall apply to all allowable
deductions except the statutory exemption:—
(a) where a deduction relates directly to the income from
dividends, it shall be made successively from that
income, from the other income from property, and from
the income from personal exertion;
( b) where a deduction relates directly to the income from
property other than dividends, it shall be made succes-
sively from that income, from the income from
dividends, and from the income from personal exertion;
(c) in all other cases, the deduction shall be made successively
from the income from personal exertion, from the income
from property other than dividends, and from the
income from dividends.
51. (1 .) All losses and outgoings to the extent to which they
are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are
necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of
gaining or producing such income, shall be allowable deductions
except to the extent to which they are losses or outgoings of capital,
or of a capital, private or domestic nature, or are incurred in relation
to the gaining or production of exempt income.(A)
(2.) Expenditure incurred or deemed to have been incurred in
the purchase of stock used by the taxpayer as trading stock shall
be deemed not to be an outgoing of capital or of a capital nature.
Lobsps and
outgoings.
(A) The previous Commonwealth law per-
mitted the deduction of all losses and out-
goings, other than those of a capital nature,
actually incurred in gaining or producing
the assessable income, and prohibited the
allowance of money not wholly and ex-
clusively expended for that purpose.
In the course of carrying on a business,
there is a class of deduction which, although
properly deductible in arriving at the profit
from the standpoint of accountancy, does
not survive the test mentioned in the
previous paragraph. The disallowance
of these deductions has been a source
of irritation to taxpayers generally.
Under this section the taxpayer will
be allowed a deduction of all losses and
outgoings, incurred in gaining or producing
the assessable income, or necessarily in-
curred in carrying on a business for the

other than dividends, it shall be made successively from
that income, from the income from dividends, and from
the income from personal exertion;
(c) in all other cases, the deduction shall be made successively
from the income from personal exertion, from the
income from property other than dividends, and from
the income from dividends.
23.—(1.) In calculating the taxable income of a taxpayer, the
total assessable income derived by the taxpayer shall be taken as
a basis, and from it there shall be deducted—
(a) all losses and outgoings (including commission, discount,
travelling expenses, interest and expenses, and not being
in the nature of losses and outgoings of capital) actually
incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income:

legislative effect to a principle which has
recently been laid down by the High Court
in appeal cases.
There will be some reduction in the field

section both the general allowance and the
general disallowance provisions of the pre-
vious Act.


52. Any loss incurred by the taxpayer in the year of income upon
the sale of any property or from the carrying on or carrying out of
any undertaking or scheme, the profit (if any) from which sale,
undertaking or scheme would have been included in his assessable
income, shall be an allowable deduction.
53. —(1.) Expenditure incurred by the taxpayer in the year of
income for repairs, not being expenditure of a capital nature, (A.) to
any premises, or part of premises, plant, machinery, implements,
utensils, rolling stock, or articles held, occupied or used by him for
the purpose of producing assessable 'income, or in carrying on a
business for that purpose, shall be an allowable deduction.
(2.) Expenditure incurred upon repairs to any premises or part
of premises not so held occupied or used shall not be an allowable
deduction.
54. —(1.) Depreciation during the year of income of any property,
being plant, or articles owned by a taxpayer and used by him during
that year for the purpose of producing assessable income, and of any
property being plant or articles owned by the taxpayer which has
been installed ready for use(°) for that purpose and is during that
year held in reserve by him shall, subject to this Act, be an allowable
deduction.
(2.) In-this section, “plant” includes—
(а) animals used as beasts of burden or working beasts in a
business other than a business of primary production/ 13 )
and machinery, implements, utensils and rolling slock;
and
(б) fences, dams and other structural improvements on land
which is used for the purposes of agricultural or pastoral
pursuits( E ) but does not include improvements used for
domestic or residential purposes.

(A) Expenditure by a taxpayer who
purchases a property in a state of
disrepair, and spends considerable sums in
repairs in order to restore it to a habitable
condition is considered to be expendi-
ture of a capital nature, and if it
had been incurred before purchase, would
have been reflected in the purchase price.
The section excludes as a deduction expen-
diture of a capital nature on repairs, and
the provision thus conforms with the
general scheme of the Act.
(B) Under the previous law, deprecia-
tion was limited to “ Wear and tear ” under
section 23 (1) (c) (i), but not under the
alternative allowance provided by section
23(1) (e) (ii). Obsolescence under the first-
mentioned provision was indirectly allowed,
however, when the plant was disposed of.
As revised, the reference to “ wear and
tear ” has been deleted.
(C) Depreciation was under the previous
Act allowed on plant owned and “ used ”
for the production of assessable income. The
1930 Act extends the allowance to plant
installed ready for use for that purpose,
and held in reserve.

by the taxpayer for the purpose of producing income :

stock schedule on the death or sale of these
animals.
. . (E) The provision in the previous Act
dealing with the depreciation of structural
improvements on land owned and used for
agricultural or pastoral pursuits was
inserted in that Act in 1927 to cover the
following three classes of case: —
(a) owners of land who are personally
using the land for the purposes
mentioned, and who have con-
structed or purchased from a
previous owner, the fences, dams,
&c., on the land;
(b) lessees of land, but only in respect
of fences, dams, &c., constructed
by them during the periods of
their leases; and
(c) owners of such lands, who might
lease them to other persona.
These owners were to be entitled
to charge the depreciation allow


55. In the first calculation of the depreciation to be allowed in
respect of any unit of property, an estimate shall be made by the
Commissioner of the effective life of the unit assuming that it is
maintained in reasonably good order and condition, and the annua)
depreciation per centum shall be fixed accordingly. ( A )
56. —(1.) Subject to this section, the depreciation allowable under
this Act in respect of .any unit of property shall be—
(a) the percentage fixed under the last preceding section, or
under the previous Act, of the depreciated value of that
unit at the beginning of the year of income; or
(b) at the option of the taxpayer (to be exercised within the
time, in the manner, and subject to the conditions
prescribed( B )), the percentage so fixed of the cost of that
unit.
(2.) The deduction allowable in respect of any unit of property
shall not exceed the depreciated value of that unit.
(3.) Where any property has been bought by the taxpayer, no
amount paid by him, which has been allowed or is allowable under
this or the previous Act as a deduction to him from the assessable
income of any year otherwise than on account of depreciation, shall
be deemed to be part of the cost of the property.
57. Where depreciation has been allowed to a taxpayer, whether
under this or the previous Act, in respect of any year prior to the

For the purposes of the deduction, the
Commissioner has ruled in respect of (6)
that a lessee may be deemed to own, during
the period of his lease, the improvements
effected by him. In regard to owners
covered in case (c), however, the 1927
amendment was defective, as the land is not
used by the owner for agricultural or pas-
toral pursuits. This defect is now remedied
in section 54 (2) (6).

purposes of producing income, and, in the. case of a
person carrying on agricultural or pastoral pursuits,

in relation to the deduction of sums under sub-para-
graph (i) or (ii) of this paragraph:—
(1) Where a deduction has been allowed under para-
graph (d) of this sub-section, the Commis-
sioner shall take into consideration the sum
allowed under that paragraph in determining
the sum to be allowed under this paragraph;
(2) In calculating the deduction to be allowed under
this paragraph the estimated life of the unit
of property in respect of which the deduction
is allowable shall be ascertained for the pur-
pose of fixing the diminution in value per
centum of that property. The estimated life
of the unit of property shall be determined
by the Commissioner and shall be his estimate
of its reasonably effective life, assuming it is
maintained in good order and condition;
Provided further that in ascertaining the sum to be
allowed under sub-paragraph (ii) of this paragraph
the Commissioner shall determine the estimated remain-
ing life of the particular property under consideration
and shall, subject to the last preceding proviso, allow
as a deduction in each year of the estimated remaining
life the sum obtained by dividing the cost of the
property by the number of years of its estimated total
life;

58. (I.) Where the depreciated value under this Act of any
property at the beginning of the year of income is higher than its
depreciated value at that time under a State Act relating to Income
Tax, and the Commissioner is satisfied that if those values were equal
the corresponding values in each subsequent year would remain equal,
the Commissioner may allow, in lieu of the depreciation otherwise
allowable, an amount of depreciation calculated as if the depreciated
value at the beginning of the year of income under the State Act had
been substituted for the depreciated value at that time under this
Act. (A)
(2.) Where the last preceding sub-section is applied in any assess-
ment, a further amount of depreciation shall also be an allowable
deduction in that assessment, being an amount determined by the
Commissioner, which shall not be less than one-tenth part of the
difference between those depreciated values at the beginning of the
year to the assessment of the income of which this section is first
applied, provided that the further amount shall not in any case exceed
the amount required to make the depreciated values of the property
under this and the State Act equal.
(3.) Where depreciation has been allowed under this section in
respect of any property in any assessment of a taxpayer, depreciation
shall be allowed under this section in all future assessments of that
taxpayer in which depreciation in respect of that property is allow-
able, until the depreciated value under this Act and tire State Act
are equal.
Depreciation
under
Commonwealth
and State Acts.
(A) This section has been inserted with
a view to the adoption for both Common-
wealth and State taxation purposes of
uniform allowances for depreciation. This
entails the adoption of uniform values for
plant, a uniform method of calculating
depreciation, and uniform rates of deprecia-
tion.
Rates of depreciation are fixed by the
Commissioner, and not by the legislature
itself, and action with a view to the arViv-
ing at uniform rates for Commonwealth
and State purposes has been taken.
In order to bring into uniformity exist-
ing differences of values used in some States
compared with values used for Common-
wealth purposes in respect of depreciation
allowances, the 1936 Act makes provision


23. (1) (e) (ii) (6) In calculating the deduction under this para-
graph in respect of fences the amount of the
value of the fences by reference to which the
deduction should be calculated shall not include
the amount or the sum of the amounts allow-
able or allowed as deductions under sub-
section (la.) of this section in the assessments
of the taxpayer;
(7) Where a taxpayer has, in respect of his assess-
ment for any financial year, exercised his
option under this paragraph, he shall not,
except with the consent of the Commissioner,
have the right to make a further option in
respect of that assessment or in respect of his
assessment for any subsequent financial year:
for the adoption as the depreciated value for
both Commonwealth and State purposes of
the lower of the two values. The difference
between that value and the higher value
previously adopted by the Commonwealth
or the State, as the may be, will be
allowed by the Department concerned as a
deduction by way of a further allowance
for depreciation, the deduction being spread
over a period, as determined by the Com-
missioner, not exceeding ten years.
The adoption of uniform allowances for
depreciation for Commonwealth and State
purposes will considerably simplify the
preparation by taxpayers of the depreciation
schedules furnished with their returns, and
will also facilitate the preparation and
check of assessments.


59. —(1.) Where any property of a taxpayer, in respect of which
depreciation has been allowed or is allowable under this or the
previous act, is disposed of, lost or destroyed (A) at any time in the
year of income, the depreciated value of the property at that time,
less the amount of any consideration receivable in respect of the
disposal, loss or destruction, shall be an allowable deduction.
(2.) If that consideration exceeds that depreciated value, the
excess, to the extent of the sum of the amounts allowed and allowable
in assessments for income tax under this Act and any previous law
of the Commonwealth in respect of depreciation, shall be included in
his assessable income of that year.
(3.) The consideration receivable in respect of the disposal, loss
or destruction means—
(a) in the case of a sale of the property—the sale price less the
expenses of the sale of the property;
(5) in the case of loss or destruction of the property—the
amount received or receivable under a policy of insur-
ance or otherwise in respect of the loss or destruction;
(c) in the case where the property is sold with other assets and
no separate value is allocated to the property—the
amount determined by the Commissioner;
( d) in the case where property is disposed of otherwise than
by sale —the value, if any, of the property at the date of
disposal.
60. —(1.) Where, either before or after the commencement of this
Act, a person has acquired any property in respect of which deprecia-
tion has been allowed or is allowable under this or the previous Act,
he shall not be entitled to any greater deduction for depreciation than
that which would have been allowed to the person from whom the
property was acquired if that person had retained it:
Provided that, where under the last preceding section an amount
is included in the assessable income of the person selling the property,
the person acquiring the property shall be allowed depreciation
calculated on the sum of that amount and the depreciated value o£
the property under this Act at the time of the sale.
(2.) This section shall not apply where the Commissioner is of
the opinion that the circumstances are such that depreciation based
on the actual consideration given should be allowed.
61. Where the use of any property by the taxpayer has been only
partly for the purpose of producing assessable income, only such part
of the deduction otherwise allowable under section fifty-four or
section fifty-nine of this Act in respect of that property as in the
opinion of the Commissioner is proper shall be an allowable
deduction.( E )

(A) Under the previous Act, provision
was made for the allowance of loss on the

disposed of otherwise than by sale. The
new Act extends the deduction to cases in
which the property was lost or destroyed,
contingencies which are not specifically pro-
vided for by the previous Act.

deduction has been made under this paragraph,
sells any property in respect of the deprecia-
tion of which the deduction was made there

of the year in which the sale was effected the
amount (if any) by which the sale price is
less than the depreciated value of the property,
as at the time of sale, as determined in
accordance with this paragraph. If the sale
price exceeds that depreciated value, the
amount of the excess, to the extent of the
total sum of the amounts allowed by the Com-
missioner in any previous assessments, and the
amount, if any, allowable in any subsequent
assessments, of the income of that person in
respect of the depreciation of the property,
shall be brought to account as income of that
year;
(5) If no separate value is allocated to any property
to which this paragraph applies when sold with
other assets, or if such property is disposed of
otherwise than by sale, the Commissioner shall
determine the amount which shall, for the pur-
poses of condition (4) of this paragraph be
deemed to be the selling price of that property;

the person acquiring that property shall not be
entitled to any greater deduction under this

allowed to the person from whom it was
acquired if he had retained it. how-
ever, the person acquiring the property is not
a company in which the transferor is substan-
tially interested as a shareholder, or is not a
company, the shareholding interests of which
are in substantially the same hands as those
of the company from which it was acquired,

cumstances are such that • a deduction under
this paragraph based upon the actual amount
of the consideration given should be allowed,
the deduction calculated on that basis may be
allowed;

gchemo of the Act, depreciation * is
allowed on property used for the pro-
duction of assessable income. Where
property, on which depreciation is allow-
able, is used in part only for the produc-
tlon of assessable income, it is necessary to
provide that a proportionate part only of
the deduction should be allowed,

total assessable income derived by the taxpayer shall be taken as a
basis, and from it there shall be deducted—
(r) debts actually written off as bad debts during the year
in which the income was derived to the extent that it is
proved to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that such

borrowed which is in the year of income, bears to the whole of that
period, shall be an allowable deduction ;( c )
Provided that, if the period for which the money was borrowed

(A) Sub-scction (2) amalgamates the
provisions relating to the cost of main-

Act. No allowance is permitted in respect of
the maintenance of a taxpayer’s wife (or
children under 10 years), notwithstanding
the fact that the wife may devote the whole
of her time to rendering services in her
husband’s business. The husband is
required under the common law to provide
maintenance for his family, and the family
concessional deductions allowed by the Act
arc in recognition of the domestic responsi-
bilities of the taxpayer.
(B) Contributions to pension funds have
been divided in the 1930 Act into two
classes, viz., payments made under a legal
obligation, and voluntary payments.
Payments under a legal obligation
would include the contributions made
by an employer to a pension fund

unless the Commissioner is satisfied that the payments
have been made hona fide in the course of business and

ances for employees as is sufficient under the terms of
the constitution of the fund to provide those benefits,
pensions or allowances for employees who are residents:

for the benefit of employees who are resi-
dents, as required under the previous Act,
but upon the extent to which the contribu-
tion is for the benefit of employees engaged
in the production of the taxpayer’s
assessable income.
Voluntary contributions to pension funds
are provided for in section 78 (6), and are
treated in the same manner as charitable
gifts. A deduction will be allowed, up to
the extent of the not income of the year,
in respect of voluntary contributions to a
pension fund established for the benefit of
employees who are residents, or for the
benefit of dependants of such employees.

Explanatory Note:—
This amendment is designed primarily to extend the deduction of State income
and land taxes to taxes of a similar nature imposed by a Territory of the Common-
wealth.
The opportunity has been taken to improve the structure of the sub-section
by the use of paragraphs.




23. — (1b.) Notwithstanding anything contained in this section
where any person has acquired land, or any estate or interest in
land, carrying standing timber, for the purpose of the felling, removal
and sale of that timber, there shall be deducted from the proceeds
of the sale in any year of timber removed from- the land such pro-
portion of the part of the price paid for the land, estate or interest
which represents the value of the timber standing on the land at
the date of acquisition of the land, estate or interest, as in the opinion
of the Commissioner, is attributable to the timber sold in that year.

tralia by the taxpayer in the year in which the income
was derived:
Provided that, when a taxpayer receives a refund of
the whole or any part of the rates or taxes mentioned in

Act a deduction is allowed of a loss incurred
by the taxpayer through the embezzlement

payer’s business of money which is or has
been included in the assessable income of

in that year in respect of membership of that association, shall be an
allowable deduction, and any such subscriptions, levies or con-
tributions exceeding in the aggregate that amount, shall be an

following amounts: —
(a) ten pounds ten shillings;
( b ) so much of the subscriptions, levies or contributions as
bears to the whole, the same proportion as the losses and

(A) Where the carrying on of the tax-
payer’s business is conditional upon mem-
bership of an association, the previous Act
allowed a deduction in full of the subscrip-
tion paid by the taxpayer. This allowance
is continued in section 73 (1) of the 1930
Act.
In other cases, the previous Act allowed a
deduction of that portion of the taxpayer’s
subscription to a trade, business or pro-
fessional association which is represented
by the cost of activities carried out by the
association, which, if carried out by the
taxpayer himself, would be an allowable
deduction. In order to obviate the neces-
sity for investigating the extent of the
activities of the association in the case of
small subscriptions, section 73 (2) provides
that subscriptions to such associations up
to £lO 10s. shall be allowed in full
without dissection. Only in respect of sub-
scriptions in excess of such minimum will
dissection bo necessary.
It is considered that in the case of the
small annual subscriptions, the tax in-
volved does not warrant investigation into


membership of an association (whether corporate or
unincorporate) unless—
(i) that subscription is expressly allowable as a
deduction under any of the provisions of this
Act;
(ii) the carrying on of a business, or the exercise of a
vocation or calling, from which assessable
income is derived by him is conditional upon
such membership; or
(iii) the association carries out, on behalf of its mem-
bers, during the year in which the assessable
income of the person was derived, any activity
of such a nature that, if carried out by that
person on his own behalf, its expense would be
an allowable deduction to that person under
this Act:
Provided that in a case to -which this sub-
paragraph applies the person shall be entitled
to a deduction of only so much of his subscrip-
tion as bears to the whole of the subscription
the same proportion as the losses or outgoings
so incurred by the association in carrying out
that activity bear to the total losses and out-
goings (not being in the nature of losses and
outgoings of capital) of the association for
that year;
the activities carried on by the association,
and the disallowance of the subscription
causes irritation to taxpayers out of all
projKirtion to the revenue involved.
Sub-section (3) permits a deduction up
to £lO 10s. of subscriptions not other-
wise provided for, which are paid to trade,
business or professional associations. This
provision will permit of a deduction, up
to the amount specified, of periodical sub-
scriptions paid by taxpayers, including
employees, to professional associations and
trade unions.
(B) Although there was no specific pro-
vision in the Commonwealth Act dealing
with election expenses, in practice a deduc-
tion was allowed in the year of elec-
tion of election expenses, not in excess of
amounts prescribed by the electoral
law, incurred by successful, but not un-
successful, candidates for Parliament. The
ntnv section provides that election expenses
shall be allowed as a deduction both to
successful and unsuccessful candidates.


75. Expenditure incurred in the year of income by a tax-
payer engaged in primary production on any land in Australia
in—
(a) the eradication or extermination of animal or vegetable

taking with the government or an authority of a State
for the purchase of wire or wire netting for use in the
construction or alteration of a fence to prevent animal
pests entering upon the land used by him in the
production of assessable income,
the following amount shall be an allowable deduction:—
(c) such amount as the Commissioner is satisfied has been
expended by that taxpayer in the purchase of the wire
or wire netting placed by him in position on the fence in
the year of income and in so placing the wire or wire
netting in position; or

total assessable income derived by the taxpayer shall be taken as
a basis, and from it there shall be deducted—
(g) in the case of a person carrying on primary production
on any land in Australia—expenditure incurred by
him in any of the following operations:—
(i) Eradication or extermination of animal or
vegetable pests from the land;
(ii) The destruction and removal of timber, scrub or
undergrowth indigenous to the land; the
destruction of weed or plant growth detri-
mental to the land; the preparation of the
land for agriculture; ploughing and grassing
the land for grazing purposes; and the drain-
ing of swamp or low-lying lands, where that
operation improves the agricultural or grazing
value of land so drained.
For the purposes of this paragraph
“ primary production ” means the production
resulting directly from—
(1) the cultivation of land; or
(2) the maintenance of animals or poultry
for the purpose of selling them or
of selling their bodily produce
including natural increase of the
animals or poultry;
(la.) Notwithstanding anything contained in paragraph (a) of
the last preceding sub-section, any person who is liable to render a
return of income for the purposes of this Act, and who proves to
the satisfaction of the Commissioner that—
(o) he is carrying on agricultural or pastoral pursuits in a
district which is subject to the ravages of animal pests;
and
(6) that he has expended money for, or entered into a contract
or undertaking with the Government, or an authority,
of a State for, the purchase of wire or wire netting for
use in the construction or alteration of a fence to
prevent animal pests entering upon the land used by
him in the production of assessable income,

is satisfied has been expended by the person in the
purchase of the wire or wire netting so placed and in
placing it in position on the fence; or

netting under a contract or undertaking with the
Act. The definition of “ primary production ” is set out in section 6. Pare 16.

the wire or wire netting in position on the fence.
77. —(1.) Where a loss is incurred in the year of income by a
taxpayer in carrying on in Australia a business the income from
which, if any, would be exempt income (which business is, in this
section, called “ the exempt business ”) that loss shall be an allowable
deduction. (A)
(2.) In calculating the amount of that loss, no deduction may be
made which would not have been an allowable deduction if the income
(if any) had been assessable income.
(3.) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, where a
deduction allowable under this section has been made from the
income of any of the three years next preceding the year of income,
profits derived by the taxpayer from the exempt business in the year
of income shall be included in his assessable income, provided that
the amount so included shall not exceed the amount, if any, by which
the deductions so made from the income of those three years exceed
the profits included under this sub-section in the assessable income
of those years in respect of those deductions.
78. —(1.) The following shall, to an extent in the aggregate not
exceeding the amount of income remaining after deducting from
the assessable income all other allowable deductions except the
deduction of losses of previous years and of the statutory exemption,
be allowable deductions; —( B )
(a) Gifts of the value of one pound and upwards made by the
taxpayer in the year of income to any of the following
funds, authorities or institutions in Australia:—
(i) a public hospital;
(ii) a public benevolent institution;
(iii) a public fund established and maintained for the
purpose of providing money for public
hospitals or public benevolent institutions in
Australia, or for the establishment of such
hospitals or institutions (°), or for the relief of
Lora to deriving
exempt Income.
Gifts nad
contributions.
(A) Section 2(i (1) of the previous Act
permitted the deduction of a loss incurred
in carrying on any business in Australia,
including a business the income from which
is exempt—such as a business of primary
production in the Northern Territory or of
gold-mining in any part of Australia. In
the 1930 Act losses in deriving exempt
income are provided for in section 77 (1).
It is considered that the rule under sec-
tion 26 of the previous law of offsetting
losses against income derived from the
exempt business, is the proper rule. This
phase of the law was carefully examined
by the Royal Commission on Taxation, and,
in reporting upon it, the Royal Commission
pointed out that persons in receipt of
exempt income have already had the
benefit of not being taxed on it, so that
it is not unreasonable to stipulate that
they should not receive a further conces-
sion at the expense of the general taxpayer
by ignoring this exempt income when con-
sidering the deduction to be allowed for
losses they have sustained. Sub-section (3)


Government, or an authority, of a State—of the amount
paid by him, in respect of that wire or wire netting,
in the year in which the income is derived, as purchase
money or interest thereon and the amount (if any)
expended by him in that year in placing the wire or
wire netting in position on the fence.
23.—(1.) In calculating the taxable income of a taxpayer, the
total assessable■ income derived by the taxpayer shall be taken as
a basis, and from it there shall be deducted—
(7i) (ii) gifts of One pound and upwards made out of the
assessable income derived during the year in which
the gifts are made to public charitable institutions in
Australia, to public universities in Australia or to
colleges affiliated therewith or established by the Com-
monwealth, or to a public fund established and main-
tained for providing money for the construction or
maintenance by or on behalf of the Commonwealth,, a
State or a Territory of the Commonwealth, of a public
memorial relating to the war which commenced on the
fourth day of August One thousand nine hundred and
fourteen, if the gifts are verified to the satisfaction of
the Commissioner.
therefore provides that where losses have
been allowed under the section, any profits
derived in the three next succeeding years
from the exempt business should be
included in the assessable income to the
extent of the losses previously allowed
against assessable income.
(B) The previous test that payment must
be made out of the assessable income of the
year is removed in the 1930 Act, in view
of the comment of the Royal Commission
on Taxation that a gift to a charity is not
usually decided upon with any immediate
reference to the question whether assessable
income, exempt income or capital fundi
are to be used for that purpose. Under
this section, the deduction will be allowed,
from whatever source the payment is made
up to the amount of the net income of
the year.
(C) The words “or for the establish-
ment of euah hospitals or institutions ”
have been added to cover gifts in cases
where the hospital or institution is not at
the time of the gift established.


persons in Australia (A-) who are in necessitous
circumstances;
(iv) a public authority engaged in research into the
causes, prevention or cure of disease in human
beings, animals or plants, where the gift is
for such research, or a public institution
engaged solely in such research ;(B)
(v) a public university or a public fund for the
establishment of a public university;(°)
(vi) a residential educational institution affiliated
under statutory provisions with a public
university, or established by the Common-
wealth; and
(vii) a public fund established and maintained for
providing money for the construction or main-
tenance of a public memorial relating to the
war which commenced on the fourth day of
August, One thousand nine hundred and
fourteen.
(6) Sums which are not otherwise allowable deductions and
which are set apart or paid by the taxpayer in the year
of income as or to a fund to provide individual personal
benefits, pensions or retiring allowances for employees
who are residents and are engaged in his or any business
or class of business, or dependants of such employees, if
the rights of the employees or dependants to receive the
benefits, pensions or retiring allowances are fully
secured. (B)
(c) Sums which are not otherwise allowable deductions, and
which are paid by the taxpayer during the year of
income as retiring allowances or pensions to persons who
are or have been employees or dependants of employees,
where such persons are residents, to the extent to
which in the opinion of the Commissioner those sums are
paid lona fide in consideration of the past services of
the employees in any business of the taxpayer. (F)
(A) The words “ in Australia ” have been
added in the last two lines of the para-
graph in order to make the intention of
the law clear.
(B) The paragraph has been extended in
the 1930 Act to include gifts to public
institutions, under the conditions men-
tioned.
(C) The paragraph has been extended to
include gifts in cases where the university
is not, at the time of the gift, established.
(D) As contributions to the Repatriation
Authorities have now practically ceased, it
is considered that there is no useful pur-
pose served by retaining the provision set
out in section 23 (1) (ft) (i) of the pre-
vious Act.
(E) See note, referring to section (10.

For the purposes of this sub-paragraph—
“ Affiliated college ” means a residential educa-
tional institution affiliated under statutory
provisions with a public university;
“ Public charitable institution ” means a public
hospital, a public benevolent institution and
includes a public fund established and main-
tained for the purpose of providing money for
such institutions or for the relief of persons
in necessitous circumstances:
(ft) (i) contributions made to the Department of Repatriation
or to any public authority for the purpose of being
handed over to the Department of Repatriation :( D )
Provided that the value of the contribution if in kind
shall be verified to the satisfaction of the Commissioner;
(p) so much of the assessable income as the Commissioner is
satisfied has been donated by the taxpayer for research
into the causes, prevention or cure of disease in human
beings, animals or plants, to any authority in Australia
which the Commissioner is satisfied is a public authority
engaged in such research;
23. (1) O) Provided also that if the Commissioner is satisfied
that any part of the assessable income of a person has
been so set aside or paid by that person to provide
individual personal benefits, pensions or retiring allow-
ances to employees (who are residents) in any business
or class of business, the person setting aside or paying
the sum shall be entitled to deduct it;
(F) Under the previous law, there was no
specific provision for the deduction of pen-
sions paid to individual employees, and not
to a pension fund. It was the practice of
the Commissioner to allow a deduction of
pensions and retiring allowances paid to
employees where it was an established
practice in the business for such payments
3924.-4
to be made, but not otherwise. Specific
provision is now made for the
deduction of pensions and retiring allow-
ances paid to employees or dependants of
employees, where the Commissioner is of
opinion that the payments are made bona
fide in consideration of the past services of
the employees in the taxpayer’s business.


(d) Calls on shares in a mining company or syndicate carry-
ing on mining operations in Australia for gold, silver,
base metals, rare minerals or oil, or in any company
carrying on afforestation in Australia as its principal
business. (A)

gift in kind —(B)
(o) unless it was purchased by the taxpayer within twelve
months immediately preceding the making of the gift;
or
(b) to an extent greater than the sum paid by him for the gift.
79. The following amounts (in this Act called “the concessional
deductions ”) shall be allowable deductions where the taxpayer is a
resident:—( c >
(a) The sum of fifty pounds in respect of the spouse of the
taxpayer, or where the taxpayer is a widower, in respect
of a female relative having the care of any of his
children who are under sixteen years of age, if the
spouse or relative is a resident and is wholly maintained
by the taxpayer. For the purpose of this paragraph,
the spouse or relative shall be deemed to be wholly
maintained by the taxpayer if the separate net income
derived from all sources by the spouse or relative in the
year of income does not exceed fifty pounds and the tax-
payer contributes to the maintenance of the spouse or
relative, and not otherwise;(D)
Conceoslonat
deductions.
(A) As in the ease of charitable gifts,
the reference in section 23(1) (t) of the
previous Act to payments out of the
assessable income has been deleted, and the
test of payments up to the amount of the
net income of the year has been substituted.
The proviso to the previous section is
embodied in a general provision dealing
with double deductions, set out in section 82.
(B) The allowance as a deduction of
gifts in kind was under the previous Act
limited to gifts acquired out of the assess-
able income of the year. With the removal
of that test, provision is now made under
the .1930 Act for the allowance of gifts
in kind purchased within twelve months
preceding the making of such gifts.
(C) The Koval Commission on Taxation
expressed the view that the concessional
deductions granted in recognition of
domestic responsibilities affect the great
majority of taxpayers, and absence of

tal assessable income derived by the taxpayer shall be taken as
basis, and from it there shall be deducted—
(t) so much of the assessable, income as is paid in calls on
shares in a mining company or syndicate carrying on
mining operations in Australia for gold, silver, base
metals, rare minerals or oil, or in any company carrying

Provided that, when any such shares are acquired
and sold in circumstances which cause the proceeds
of sale to be assessable income, the amount allowable
as a deduction in respect of the cost of acquisition of
those shares or in respect of their value at the com-
mencement of the.period in which the sale was made
shall not be greater than the excess (if any) of that
amount over the amount or the total of the amounts
allowed or allowable as deductions under this paragraph
in respect of calls paid by the taxpayer upon those
shares;
23. (1) (h) (ii) “ Gift ” means a gift in the form of money or a
gift in kind when the Commissioner is satisfied
that the donor has used part of his assessable
income of the year for the acquisition of the
gift;
uniformity between Commonwealth and
(State practice in regard to them accounts
for many of the complexities which con-
fuse taxpayers. Section 79 was designed
with the object of achieving as large a
measure of uniformity as possible with the
States, in regard to the nature, conditions
and amounts of the concessional deductions,
so far as the revenue requirements
permitted.
■ (D) In the interests of uniformity, the
|I93G Act provides for a deduction by the
Commonwealth of £5O in the case of a wife
wholly maintained by her husband (or
vice versa). The spouse shall be deemed
to be wholly maintained if the separate net
income of the spouse does not exceed £5O
per annum, and the taxpayer contributes
to the "maintenance of the spouse. The
deduction is also extended to a widower
who wholly maintains a female relative
for the purpose of caring for his children
under sixteen years of age.


Provided that, if that spouse or relative is wholly
maintained by the taxpayer during part only of the year
of income, the deduction allowable shall be such part of
the sum of fifty pounds as, in the opinion of the
Commissioner, is reasonable in the circumstances;
(b) The sum of fifty pounds in respect of each child who is a
resident and is under the age of sixteen years at the
beginning of the year of income and is wholly main-
tained by the taxpayer .-(A)
Provided that, where a child is born during the year
of income, or attains the age of sixteen years during the
year, or is wholly maintained by the taxpayer during
part only of the year, or is only partially maintained by
him during the whole or part of the year, the deduction
allowable shall be such part of that sum as, in the
opinion of the Commissioner, is reasonable in the
circumstances;
(c) Payments not exceeding fifty pounds in the aggregate
made by the taxpayer in the year of income to any
legally qualified medical practitioner, nurse or chemist,
or public or private hospital, in respect of any illness of
or operation upon the taxpayer or his spouse or any of
his children under the age of twenty-one years, if the
spouse or child is a resident;< B )
( d ) Payments not exceeding twenty pounds in the aggregate
made by the taxpayer in the year of income for funeral
and burial or cremation expenses arising out of the
death of his spouse, or of any of his children under the
age of twenty-one years, if the spouse or child was, at
the time of death, a resident, to the extent to which
those expenses are not recouped to him by any society
or and
(A) The previous allowance in respect of
children is continued. Where a child was
wholly maintained for portion of the year
only a proportionate amount of the deduc-
tion was under the previous Act allowed
by the Commissioner. The 1930 Act pro-
vides for the continuance of a propor-
tionate deduction in such circumstances,
and also where the child is only partially
maintained during the whole or part of the
year.

tion of medical expenses was limited to
taxpayers whose net income did not exceed

(ii) not exceeding in the aggregate the sum of Twenty
pounds as is paid by him to any undertaker for
funeral and burial expenses arising out of the
death of the wife of the taxpayer or of any
of his children under the age of twenty-one
years.
For the purposes of this paragraph “ net income ”
means the residue of the assessable income of the tax-
payer after allowing all other deductions allowed by this
Act except the deductions under section twenty-four
and paragraph (g) of sub-section (1.) of this section;
£9OO. In accordance with the recommenda-
tion of the Royal Commission, the income
limitation is removed by this paragraph

expenses incurred by the taxpayer up to a
maximum of £5O.

widows’ or orphans’ funds, or to any friendly
society, for the personal benefit of the tax-
payer or of his spouse or children.

(A) Under the previous Commonwealth
law the deduction for life assurance pre-
miums was limited to a maximum amount
of £5O, and insurance must have been
effected in Australia. The deduction for
payments to a Superannuation Fund was
limited to a maximum amount of £lOO and
the fund must have been established in
Australia. There was also, in the case of
payments to superannuation funds, an
income limitation of £BOO.
Based on the recommendation of the
Royal Commission the 1936 Act provides
that these payments shall be aggregated
and treated as one allowance with a fixed
maximum, the maximum being fixed at

the year in which the income was derived on the insur-
ance on his own life or that of his wife or children

his wife or children or in respect of any fidelity
guarantee or bond which the taxpayer is required to
provide in the exercise of his business:
Provided that in no case shall any deduction be
allowed under this paragraph beyond the sum of Fifty
pounds in the aggregate or for any premium or sum paid
in respect of any insurance, annuity or other provision
effected outside Australia;
23. (1)
(g) payments not exceeding One hundred pounds in the
aggregate made for the personal benefit of the taxpayer

also been removed.
The territorial limitation previously
placed on these payments imposed a hard-

that income and the net exempt income of that year, and the amount
of the loss shall be deemed to be the amount of such excess.< B >
(2.) So much of the losses incurred by a taxpayer in any of the
four years next preceding the year of income as has not been allowed
as a deduction from his income of any of those years shall be allow-
able as a deduction in accordance with the following provisions:—
(a) where he has not in the year of income derived exempt
income, the deduction shall be made from the assessable
income;
(fc) where he has in that year derived exempt income, the
deduction shall be made successively from the net
exempt income and from the assessable income;
(c) where a deduction is allowable under this section in respect
of two or more losses, the losses shall be taken into
account in the order in which they were incurred:
Provided that, if the Governor-General by proclamation so directs,
the period of three years shall, as on and after such date as is specified
in the proclamation, be substituted for the period of four years
specified in this sub-section.(°)
(3.) In this section “net exempt income” means—
(o) where the taxpayer is a resident —the amount by which his
exempt income derived from all sources exceeds the sum
of the expenses (not being expenses of a capital nature)
incurred in deriving that income, and any taxes payable
in respect of that income in any country outside
Australia; and
( b) where he is a non-resident—the amount by which his
exempt income derived from sources in Australia
exceeds the sum of the expenses (not being expenses of
a capital nature) incurred in deriving that income.
(A) tiee explanatory note to section 154
(page ICO).
(B) Under the previous Commonwealth
law a taxpayer who in any year suffered a
business loss was permitted to carry that
loss forward for a period not exceeding four
years, subject to its being set off firstly
against any exempt income derived during
those years. The net assessable income of
any of the four years subsequent to the
loss was then reduced by the loss thus
ascertained. A person who was in receipt of
rents, interest, dividends or other income
of an investment character, was not
regarded as carrying on a business, and in
such a case the excess deductions over the
income of any year could not be carried
forward.
It was considered that provision should
be made to cover all classes of taxpayers who
may suffer losses which would otherwise be
allowable deductions from assessable
income, and in the 1936 Act the limitation
to persons carrying on a business has been
removed.

the sale of which would have been assessable as income

that person shall be entitled to a deduction of that loss from the net
assessable income (if any) derived by him in that year,
(2.) In addition to any deduction which may be made under the
last preceding sub-section in respect of any loss, a taxpayer shall be
entitled to a deduction of any similar loss, or of part of any similar
loss, incurred by him in any of the four years next preceding the year
in which the income was derived, if, on account of the insufficiency
of net assessable income in those years, no deduction of that loss, or
(as the case may be) of that part of that loss, is allowable, under this
section, in assessments for financial years preceding that for which the
assessment is made:
Provided that—
(o) if a deduction is allowable in respect of two or more losses,
the losses shall be taken into account in the order in
which they were incurred; and

would have been allowable as a deduction in an assess-

(C) Page 98. The carrying forward of
losses is not at present the law in all States.
In the interests of uniformity, State Minis-
ters in conference have agreed as to the
equity of the provision and have undertaken
to recommend to their respective Govern-
ments its adoption. The view was taken,
however, that it would be a sufficient allow-
ance if the losses were carried forward for
a period of three years. It was also con-
sidered that from the point of view of the
primary producer the acceptance of an
unqualified three year period by all Go-
vernments (or by a majority of the
Governments) would, on balance, he a
decided advantage to them. The proviso


incurred and income derived on or after that date, or
' on or after the commencement of the accounting period
substituted for the financial year commencing on that
date under sub-section (3.) of section thirty-two of this
Act, and no amount of loss, incurred prior to the first
day of July One thousand nine hundred and twenty-
six or prior to the commencement of any accounting
period substituted under sub-section (3.) of section
thirty-two of this Act for the financial year commencing
on that date, shall be taken into account under sub-
section (8.) of section thirteen of this Act in ascertain-
ing the excess of allowable deductions for the year in
which the loss was incurred, which would not have
been allowable as a deduction in the assessment of
income derived (prior to that date or that commence-
ment) in any financial year or accounting period
subsequent to the year or period in which the loss was
incurred, if the provisions of this section had been so in
force and had so applied.
(2a.) Where in any year a person who has made a loss to which
this section applies derives income which for any reason is not liable
to be assessed, the amount deductible under this section, from the net
assessable income of the year in which that income was derived, shall
be —
(a) if the person is not an absentee—the amount by which the
total sum which would otherwise be deductible under
this section exceeds the income which is not so liable,
after deducting from that income, in any case in which
there is a business loss which is attributable to sources
outside Australia (not being a loss which is allowable
as a deduction under this section) the amount of that
loss; and
(b) if the person is an absentee—the amount by which the
loss exceeds the income derived from sources in Aus-
tralia which is not so liable.
(3.) If any loss, or a part of any loss, or the aggregate of any
losses, in respect of which a deduction is allowable under this section,
exceeds the net assessable income from which the deduction is to be
made, the deduction shall be allowed to the extent of that income.
(4.) Any deduction under this section shall be made in the first
instance from the net assessable income from personal exertion. (E)
to sub-section 2, therefore, provides for the
issue of a proclamation reducing the
period of four years to three years, the
understanding being that such a proclama-
tion will not be issued unless all States
agree to the provision for the carrying
forward of losses, and until such agreement
has been implemented by legislation.
(D) Sub-spction (4) makes it clear that
the deduction does not extend to losses
from which the taxpayer has been released.
(E) The provision in sub-section (4) of
section 2G of the previous Act is, in the
193 d Act, covered in section 50 (c).


81.—(1.) The following amount (in this Act called “the
statutory exemption ”) shall be an allowable deduction to any person
other than a company;—< A >
(а) the sum of Two hundred and fifty pounds, less One pound
for every Two pounds by which the income exceeds Two
hundred and fifty pounds, or
(б) where the income does not exceed Two hundred and fifty
pounds, the amount of the income.
In this sub-section “ income ” means the residue after deducting
from the assessable income all other allowable deductions.

exemption.
(A) Under tlie 1930 Act the statutory
exemption is allowed to non-residents as
well as to residents, both in respect of
normal tax (sub-section (1)) and special
property tax (sub-section (3)).


(5.) 'Where, in calculating the deduction under sub-section (1.)
of this section for the purpose of ascertaining, in accordance with
paragraph (a) of sub-section (1.) of section twenty-nine of this Act,
the income of a partnership, any amount of loss made by the partner-
ship in any year is not deducted by reason of the insufficiency of net
assessable income, the share of each partner in that amount shall,
for all purposes of this section, be deemed to be a loss made by him
in that year.
(6.) For the purposes of this section, unless the contrary intention
appears—
(а) “ net assessable income ” means the income by reference to
which the deduction under section twenty-four of this
Act would, but for the deduction allowable under this
section, be calculated;
(б) “loss” means—
(i) in the case of a business the income (if any) of
which would, in the opinion of the Commis-
sioner, be apportionable between sources within
and sources outside Australia and the proceeds
(if any) of which would be assessable only to
the extent that they were derived from sources
within Australia—so much of the loss sus-
tained as, in the opinion of the Commissioner,
is attributable to sources within Australia; or
(ii) in the case of a business carried on wholly or
partly outside Australia the income (if any)
of which derived from sources outside Australia
would be taxable in part only under this Act
—so much of the loss which is attributable to
sources outside Australia as, in the opinion of
the Commissioner, is proportionate to the part
of the income which would be so taxable,
and shall be calculated without taking into account any
Federal income tax paid or payable by the taxpayer.
24.—(1.) The following amount (in this Act called “the statu-
tory exemption ”) shall be a deduction allowable under this Act to
any person other than a company or an absentee:—
(a) the sum of Two hundred and fifty pounds, less One pound
for every Two pounds by which the income exceeds Two
hundred and fifty pounds; or
(5) where the income does not exceed Two hundred and fifty
pounds, the amount of the income.
In this sub-section “ income ” means the residue after deducting
from the assessable income all other deductions allowable under this
Act.

(2.) The deduction of the statutory exemption shall be made
successively from the income from property other than dividends,
from the income from dividends and from the income from personal
exertion.
(3.) The preceding provisions of this section shall not be applied
in calculating the amount of the taxable income subject to special
property tax, but, for the purpose of making that calculation, there
shall be deducted (where the taxpayer is not a company) from
that part of the assessable income derived from those sources which
remains after all other deductions allowable under this Act have
been made, the amount of that part or the sum of Two hundred
and fifty pounds whichever is the less.
82. —(1.) Where in respect of any amount, a deduction would but
for this section be allowable under more than one provision of this
Act, and whether it would bo so allowable from the assessable income
of the same or different years, the deduction shall be allowable only
under that provision which in the opinion of the Commissioner is
most appropriate. (A)
(2.) Where the profit arising from the sale of any property is
included in the assessable income of any person, or where the loss
arising from the sale is an allowable deduction, and any expenditure
incurred by him in connexion with that property is an allowable
deduction under this Act or has been allowed or is allowable as a
deduction in assessments under the previous Act, that expenditure
shall not be deducted in ascertaining Hie amount of the profit or
loss.(B)
Division 4.—Leases.
83. In this Division( c )
“ lease ” when used in relation to a premium means the lease
granted, assigned or surrendered, or where the premium
is for or in connexion with any goodwill or licence means
the lease of the land to which such goodwill or licence is
attached or connected;
“ lessor ”, when used in relation to any time, means the person
at that time entitled to the reversion;
“ net premium ” means the amount ascertained by deducting
from a premium the allowable deductions directly relating
thereto;
Double
deductions.
Definitions,
(A) Section 51 allows a deduction of
all losses and outgoings not being of, or in
the nature of, capital, which are incurred
in gaining or producing assessable income,
or which are necessarily incurred in carry-
ing on a business from which assessable
income is derived.
This general provision is followed by
other provisions which allow deductions in
respect of expenditure on repairs to income-
producing property, commission on the
collection of income, rates and taxes, &c.
Some, at least, of the deductions speci-
fically provided for, are covered by the
general terms of section 51, and it is for
the purpose of ensuring that expenditure
deductible under the specific provisions is
not again deductible under the general pro-
vision, that section 82 (1) is necessary.
(B) Sub-section (2) of section 82 applies
to cases where profit or loss results from
the realization of property acquired for


SECTION 9.—STATUTORY EXEMPTION.
81.—(1.) The following amount (in this Act called “ the statutory exemption ”)
shall be an allowable deduction to any person other than a company:—
(a) the sum of Two hundred and fifty pounds, less One pound for every
Two pounds by which the income exceeds Two hundred and fifty
pounds, or
( h ) where the income does not exceed Two hundred and fifty pounds, the
amount of the income.
In this sub-section “ income ” means the residue after deducting from the
assessable income all other allowable deductions.
(2.) The deduction of the statutory exemption shall be made successively from
the income from property other than dividends, from the income from dividends,
and from the income from personal exertion.
(3.) The preceding provisions of this section shall not be applied in calculating the
amount of the taxable income subject to special property tax, but, for the purpose of making
that calculation, there shall be deducted (where the taxpayer is not a company) from that
part of the assessable income derived from those sources which remains after all other
deductions allowable under this Act have been made, the amount of that part or the
sum of Two hundred and fifty pounds whichever is the less.
Explanatory Note: —
This amendment removes one of the special property tax provisions from the
Principal Act.




(2.) The deduction of the statutory exemption shall be made
successively from the income from property other than dividends,
from the income from dividends and from the income from personal
exertion.
(3.) Where special property tax is imposed upon the taxable
income derived from any sources by any person (other than a
company or absentee) the preceding provisions of this section shall
not be applied in calculating the amount of the taxable income
subject to that tax but, for the purpose of making that calculation,
there shall be deducted, from that part of the assessable income
derived from those sources which remains after all other deductions
allowable under this Act have been made, the amount of that part or
the sum of Two hundred and fifty pounds whichever is the less.
25a. Where, in respect of property of any person from the use
or ownership of which assessable income may be derived, any
expenditure is incurred by that person in connexion with the acquisi-
tion or use of that property and a deduction in respect of that
expenditure has been allowed or is allowable under any other provision
of this Act, and the whole or any part of the proceeds of the sale of
that property is assessable as income of that person, no deduction shall
be allowed from the proceeds so assessable in respect of the expendi-
ture so allowed or allowable.

purposes of profit-making. For instance
a person may acquire real property for
purposes of re-sale at a profit. It may
be two or three years after purchase before
a satisfactory offer is received from the
property. In the meantime, the taxpayer
may be receiving rent from the property
and paying interest on money borrowed _to
purchase the property, and also paying
rates and taxes, and expending money on
repairs.
The interest, rates and taxes, and repairs
would be allowable deductions from the
rental income, and when the property was
so!d, section 82 (2) would apply to prevent
the interest, rates and taxes, and repairs,
being again deducted, when arriving at the
profit arising from the re-sale of the pro-
perty.
(C) The definitions are inserted as a
drafting medium to simplify and to
abbreviate the sections that follow.


“ premium ” means any consideration in the nature of a
premium fine or foregift payable to any person for or in
connexion with the grant or assignment by him of a lease,
or any consideration for or in connexion with the sur-
render of a lease, or for or in connexion with any goodwill
or licence attached to or connected with land a lease of
which is granted, assigned or surrendered; and where any
of the foregoing considerations is payable in more than
one amount each such amount shall be deemed to be a
premium; ( A )
“ term of the lease ” means the length of time which the
lease has to run from the date when the premium is
received, and in the case where the premium is received
for or in connexion with the surrender of a lease, the
length of time which the lease would have had to run
at the date of such receipt if it had not been surrendered:
Provided that, in the case of a perpetual lease to which
this Division applies, that length of time shall be deemed
to be One hundred years.
84. —(1.) The assessable income of a taxpayer shall, except in
eases in which the next succeeding sub-section applies, include, in
addition to rent, any premium received by him in the year of income,
and any consideration so received for or in connexion with his assent
to any grant or assignment of a lease.( B >
(2.) Where a lease from the Crown of land used for primary
production is assigned or surrendered by the taxpayer, and the lease
was acquired by him before the sixth year prior to the year of income
in which it is so assigned or surrendered, the amount of the net
premium received by the taxpayer as consideration for or in connexion
with the assignment or surrender shall be included in his assessable
income:
Provided that the amount of any net premium (or if, in respect of
the transaction, there are more net premiums than one—the sum of
the net premiums) so included shall not exceed the total of the amounts
of deductions allowed under this Act and any previous law of the
Commonwealth to the taxpayer in respect of the lease. (°)
Premiums
Included In
Assessable
income.
(A) Premium. —This definition includes
“ any consideration in the nature of a
premium ” as well as money. The previous
Act in section 16 (d) contained similar
words, but in addition made special pro-
vision to limit the taxation of am' pre-
mium in the form of shares to a person
who has a controlling interest in the com-
pany, and where those shares are sold or
transferred within two years. The absence
of these latter provisions in the 1930
Act makes the taxation of “ shares ”
dependable upon whether they are or are
not “ consideration in the nature of a
premium ”, irrespective of the former
limitations. The taxation of any shares as
a “premium ” in the recipient’s assessment,
nowever, correspondingly entitles the payor
to a deduction in his assessment.

SECTION 10.—PREMIUMS INCLUDED IN ASSESSABLE INCOME.
84.—(1.) The assessable income of a taxpayer shall, except in cases in which
the next succeeding subsection applies , include, in addition to rent, any premium
received by him in the year of income, and any consideration so received for or in
connexion with his assent to any grant or assignment of adease.
(2.) Where a lease from the Crown of land used for primary production is assigned
or surrendered by the taxpayer, and the lease was esquired by Mm before the sixth year
prior to the year of income in which it is so assigned or surrendered, the amount of the
net premium received by the taxpayer as consideration for or in connexion with the
assignment or surrender shall be included in his assessable income:
Provided that the amount of any net premium {or if, in respect of the transaction,
there are more net premiums than one —the sum of the net premiums) so included
shall not exceed the total of the amounts of deductions allowed under this Act and any
previous law of the Commonwealth to the taxpayer in respect of the lease.
Explanatory Note:—
Sub-section (2.) of section 84 was inserted in the Principal Act as a special
provision relating to Crown leases of land used for primary production.
At the time of the insertion of this provision in the Principal Act it was decided
that the general question of the taxation of the proceeds from the sale of Crown
leases should be referred to Sir David Ferguson, Chairman of the Royal Commission
on Taxation.
Sir David Ferguson’s report was tabled in the House of Representatives on
18th September, 1936.
Arising from the adoption of the recommendations made in that report the
Government decided to exclude Crown leases from the application of the general
leasehold provisions and to deal with them separately in a new section. (See Section
14 of the Amending Act which inserted the new section 88a in the Principal Act
(infra, pp. 10 and 11).)
The amendment made to section 84 is necessary to give effect to the proposal
to embrace all matters relating to taxation of Crown leaseholds in the separate
section.




16. The assessable income of any person shall include—
(d) and any amount received by way of premium, fine or
foregift or consideration in the nature of a premium,
fine or foregift demanded and given in connexion with
a lease, or by way of consideration for the assignment or
transfer of a lease, or for goodwill or a licence in respect
of a business carried on on the leased property, or for
surrendering a lease, goodwill or licence, and shall also
include, where that amount or any part of that amount
is paid by a company in the form of shares in that
company to a person who has a controlling interest in
that company and where those shares are sold or trans-
ferred by that person during the unexpired period of
the lease calculated from the date when those shares
were received or taken, or within a period of two years
after that date, whichever period is the lesser—the
amount for which the shares were so sold or transferred:
Act is substantially contained in the defini-
tion of “ premium ”
(C) Section 84 (2) was an amendment
inserted in the Act during its passage
through Parliament in order to provide
that the profit on the sale of a lease of land
from the Crown used for primary produc-
tion which was acquired before the sixth
year prior to the year of income
should not he taxed beyond the amount
of the deductions allowed to the taxpayer
in past years in connexion with the lease.
The Commonwealth Treasurer, in accord-
ance with his announcement to Parliament,
has since asked Sir David Ferguson, as
Chairman of the Royal Commission on
Taxation, to re-examine the leasehold pro-
visions of the Act with a view to furnishing
a further report on the advisability or
otherwise of retaining the amendment as a
permanent provision, both in the interests
of the Commonwealth and of the States.

85.—(1.) Where any premium is, under sub-section (1.) of section
eighty-four of this Act, included in the assessable income of a tax-
payer of the year of income, and —
(а) the premium is received for or in connexion with the
assignment or surrender of a lease, or for or in con-
nexion with the goodwill or a licence attached to or
connected with land the subject of a lease assigned or
surrendered, and the taxpayer has paid any amount—
(i) to acquire that lease or the goodwill or licence
attached to or connected with that land; or
(ii) where the lease assigned or surrendered is a lease
of land—in eifecting improvements on that
land; or
(б) the taxpayer has paid any amount for the surrender to
him of a lease, goodwill or licence for the purpose of
granting or assigning the lease, goodwill or licence for
or in connexion with which the premium was derived,
and the whole or any portion of that amount has not been allowed
or is not allowable as a deduction in assessments for income tax under
any other provisions of this Act or under any previous law of the
Commonwealth, the amount which bears the same proportion to the
amount which has not been so allowed as the premium included in
his assessable income bears to the total of the premiums received or
to be received by him for the grant, assignment, surrender,
goodwill or licence in respect of which the premium was so included,
shall be an allowable deduction. (A)
(2.) Where any premium is, under sub-section (1.) of section
eighty-four of this Act, included in the assessable income of
a taxpayer in respect of property to which he has succeeded upon
the death of another person, the taxpayer shall be entitled to the
deduction to which that other person would have been entitled,
under this section, if he had lived and the premium had been included
in his assessable income and there had been allowed or were allowable
as deductions in assessments for income tax, under any other pro-
visions of this Act or under any previous law of the Commonwealth
the same deductions as have been so allowed or are so allowable to the
taxpayer in addition to any deductions that in fact have been or are
so allowed or allowable to that other person.( E >
(3.) Where any premium is paid to a taxpayer for or in connexion
with the grant by him of a sub-lease, or for or in connexion with the
goodwill or licence attached to or connected with land the subject
of a sub-lease so granted, and is, under sub-section (1.) of
(A) This sub-section re-enacts, but in dif-
ferent arrangement of phraseology, the
previous provisions of the Commonwealth
law for determining the deductions to be
set off against the premium income.
(E) The omission of this provision in
the 1936 Act is explained by the note to
the definition of “premium” (section 83).
(C) The repetition of this provision in the
1936 Act was not deemed necessary. Sec-
tion 23 (p) of the 1938 Act specifically
exempts from taxation the income derived
by a bona fide prospector from the sale,
transfer or assignment of his rights to mine
for gold.
(D) The wording of this provision is
necessarily repeated in the previous Act in
section 25{i) (a). Both of these provisions


SECTION 11.—DEDUCTIONS.
85. —(1.) Where any premium is, under sub-section (1 .) cf section eighty-four
of this Act, included in the assessable income of a taxpayer of the year of income,
and—
(а) the premium is received for or in connexion with the assignment or
surrender of a lease, or for or in connexion with the goodwill or a
licence attached to or connected with land the subject of a lease
assigned or surrendered, and the taxpayer has paid any amount —
(i) to acquire that lease or the goodwill or licence attached to or
connected with that land; or
(ii) where the lease assigned or surrendered is a lease of land —in
effecting .improvements on that land ; or
(б) the taxpayer has paid any amount for the surrender to him of a lease,
goodwill or licence for the purpose of granting or assigning the lease,
goodwill or licence for or in connexion with which the premium was
derived,
and the whole or any portion of that amount has not been allowed or is not allowable
as a deduction in assessments for income tax under any other provisions of this Act
or under any previous law of the Commonwealth, the amount which bears the same
proportion to the amount which has not been so allowed as the premium included in
his assessable income bears to the total of the premiums received or to be received
by him for the grant, assignment, surrender, goodwill or licence in respect of which
the premium was so included, shall be an allowable deduction.
(2.) Where any premium is, under sub-section ( 1 .) of section eighty-four of this
Act, included in the assessable income of a taxpayer in respect of property to which
he has succeeded upon the death of another person, the taxpayer shall be entitled
to the deduction to which that other person would have been entitled, under this
section, if he had lived and the premium had been included in his assessable income
and there had been allowed or were allowable as deductions in assessments for income
tax, under any other provisions of this Act or under any previous law of the
Commonwealth the same deductions as have been so allowed or are so allowable to
the taxpayer in addition to any deductions that in fact have been or are so allowed
or allowable to that other person.
(3.) Where any premium is paid to a taxpayer for or in connexion with the grant
by him of a sub-lease, or for or in connexion with the goodwill or licence attached
to or connected with land the subject of a sub-lease so granted, and is, under sub-
section (2.) of




Provided that if that person has paid any amount to
acquire that lease, goodwill or licence or, if that lease is
a lease of land, in effecting any improvements on the
leased land or for the surrender to him of a lease, good-
will or licence for the purpose of granting, assigning or
transferring that lease, goodwill or licence and the whole
or any portion of that amount has not, in the assess-
ments of the income of that person, been allowed as a
deduction, under the provisions of this Act or of any
Act repealed by this Act, he shall be entitled to a
deduction in his assessment of an amount which bears
the same proportion to the amount which has not been
so allowed as the amount included in his assessable
income, under the provisions of this paragraph in
respect of that lease, goodwill or licence, bears to the
total amount of the consideration for the grant assign-
ment or transfer of that lease, goodwill or licence:
Provided further that this paragraph shall not apply
to—
(i) an amount paid by a company in the form of
shares in that company except to the extent
provided in this paragraph ;(B)
(ii) any amount of income specified in paragraph
(o) of sub-section (1.) of section fourteen
of this Act; or(C)

or a lease with a right of purchase ;( D )
in the previous Act are now covered by the
wording in section 89 of the 1930 Act by
the altered arrangement in the drafting.
(E) This is a new provision in tire Com-
monwealth law in the interests of uni-
formity. It is considered equitable that a
beneficiary, who succeeds to the ownership
''f a lease through the death of a parent,
'-3 is generally the case, should be entitled
to the same deductions in respect of tb«
lease as the parent would have been had
he remained alive. A corresponding pro-
vision already existed in the previous Act
as regards other items of possible deduc-
tions for a lease to which a beneficiary
succeeds —vide section 83 (4) of the 1936
Act and section 25 (i) of the previous Act
(second proviso).


section eighty-four of this Act, included in the assessable inconu
of the taxpayer of the year of income, and he has paid any amoun;
to acquire the lease of the premises the subject of the sub-lease ot
the goodwill or licence, so much of the total deductions to wind
be would but for this sub-section be entitled in respect of that amount
during the period for which that sub-lease is granted as bears to
those deductions the same proportion as the premium includeq
in his assessable income bears to the total of the premiums
received or to be received by him for the grant of that sub-lease or
for the goodwill or licence shall be an allowable deduction, and he
shall not during that period be entitled to any further deduction in
respect of that amount otherwise than under this sub-section.(A)
(4.) Where a net premium is, under sub-section (2.) of section
eighty-four of this Act, included in the assessable income of a tax-
payer, the deductions which would have been allowable under this
section had the full amount of the premium been included under
sub-section (1.) of that section in the assessable income of the tax-
payer, shall be taken into account only for the purpose of ascertaining
the amount of the net premium.
> 86.—(1.) Where a premium which exceeds the sum of the allow-
able deductions directly relating thereto, and in respect of which the
term of the lease is not less than twenty-five complete months, ii
included in the assessable income of a taxpayer, the following pro
visions shall apply for the determination of a notional income, for the
purpose of any Act whereby a rate of tax upon the taxable income
of a taxpayer is fixed by reference to a notional income:—(B)
(o) Where the taxable income exceeds the net premium, or th«
sum of the net premiums, if there are more than one
of the premiums so included, the notional income of the
taxpayer shall be the amount obtained by deducting
the net premium or the sum of the net premiums, as
the case may be, from the taxable income, and adding
to the result the amount or amounts ascertained by
Notional Income
of a taxpayer
deriving a
premium.
(A) The provisions of section 1G ( il ) of
the previous Act did not technically permit
of a corresponding deduction to section
85(1) to the lessor, to be set against a
premium received by him for a sub-lease,
even though the lessor might have paid a
substantial premium for the mesne lease
out of which the sub-lease was granted.
Briefly put, section 85 (1) provides for a
deduction in the case of an assignment or
transfer of a lease. Section 85 (3) pro-
vides for a deduction in the case of a grant
of a sub-lease.
(B) The section is designed to apply an
average rate of tax to the premium income.
The general averaging provisions of the
previous Commonwealth Act gave the bene-
fit of an average rate to premium income
based upon the average income of the tax-
payer over five years. With the removal
of the general averaging provisions from all
except Primary Producers, there was need
to devise an alternative average rate unless
the taxpayer (as in the provisions of most
of the previous State Acts) was to be left to
pay on his premium income, together with
his ordinary income, at the current rate
applicable to the total income of the
particular year. Provision has therefore
been made to divide the net premium by
one-half the number of years of the lease,
in order to get what is described as a
“ notional income ” for rating purposes.
If the net premium were assessed in the
year of receipt at a rate ascertained by
dividing the net premium by the total
number of years of the lease, an adjustment


section eighty-four of this Act, included in the assessable income of the
taxpayer of the year of income, and he has paid any amount to acquire the lease of
the premises the subject of the sub-lease or the goodwill or licence, so much of the
total deductions to which he would but for this sub-section be entitled in respect
of that amount during the period for which that sub-lease is granted as bears to
those deductions the same proportion as the premium included in his assessable
income bears to the total of the premiums received or to be received by him for the
grant of that sub-lease or for the goodwill or licence shall be an allowable deduction,
and he shall not during that period be entitled to any further deduction in respect
of that amount otherwise than under this sub-section.
{4.) Where a net 'premium is, under sub-section (2.) of section eighty-four of this
Act, included in the assessable income of a taxpayer, the deductions which would have
been allowable under this section had the full amount of the premium been included under
sub-section (1.) of that section in the assessable income of the taxpayer, shall be taken
into account only for the purpose of ascertaining the amount of the net premium.
Explanatory Note:—

would properly require to be made for
rating purposes in each subsequent year of
the lease in order that the rate on the
taxpayer’s “ other income ” should be based
on the sum of the “ other income ” of the
year plus the year’s quotient of the pre-
mium. Otherwise the taxpayer in receipt
of a premium would have received a con-
cession putting him in a better position
than the lessor, whose rent was received
periodically and not commuted In a
premium.
The method adopted in the section has
been arrived at for both Commonwealth
and State purposes in order to achieve sub-
stantial justice as between tax payable in
respect of premiums and that payable in
respect of other classes of income, whilst at
the same time permitting the premium
being dealt with once and for all. It goes
into the assessable income of the year of
receipt only and subsequent assessments
are not affected. Examples showing the
working of this principle are given here-
under.
No provision is made in the section for
ascertaining a notional or average income
when the period of the lease does not exceed
two years,, as in such cases it is not thought
that there is any particular hardship in
applying the actual rate of tax appropriate
to the premium for such a limited period.
There are very few leases under two years,
for which premiums are payable, but should
such a case occur, it would always be
possible for a lessor to spread his pre-
mium by receiving instalments in each of
the two years.
Example A. — (Illustrating ease under
Section 86 (1) (a).)
£
Assume the premium for a ten
years’ lease was .. .. 2,000
Deductions directly relating
thereto .. .. .. 400
Net premium .. .. 1,600
Other income—lnterest .. 200
Net income .. .. 1,800
Statutory exemption .. ..
Taxable income .. 1,800
For the purpose of ascertaining the rate,
the net premium would be deducted from
the taxable income, and one-fifth of the
net premium added in lieu. The position
would then be:—
£
Taxable income .. .. 1,800
less Net premium .. .. 1,600
200
add One-fifth of £1,600 .. 320
Notional income for rate
purposes only .. 520
Example B. — (Illustrating case under
section 86 (1) (6) (i).)
Shows the application of the rule to more
complex facts: —
(a) Assume premium £lO,OOO received
for four years unexpired period of
a lease.
(b) Assume £6,000 was paid two years
earlier when the original lease for
six years was acquired.
(c) Then £4,000 represents the propor-
tion of the original £6,000 paid
which is attributable to the four
years unexpired term of the lease.
This £4,000 is a deduction allowable
under section 85 of the Act, as
directly relating to the premium
of £lO,OOO received.
(d) Assume other deductions directly
relating to the sale of the lease
are:—
£
Legal expenses and
stamp duty .. 50
Commission .. 250
(e) The “net premium” then would
be:—
£
(a) 10.000
less (c) £4,000
(n) £3OO .. .. 4,300
£5,700
Assume the taxpayer has other income of
£2,000, and that there are other deductions


allowable under the Act of £2,200. The
taxable income would then be—
£ £
Net premium .. .. 5,700
Other income .. .. 2,000
Deductions applicable to
other income .. 2,200
Excess deductions .. 200
Taxable Income .. 5,500
(F) It is necessary here to take the
number of months in the unex-
pired period of the lease (four
years) as per (a), viz., 48
months, and divide this by 24
{vide section 80 (1) (6) (i)). The
quotient is 2.
(g) The “Notional Income” would then
be ascertained under sub-section
80 (1) (6) by dividing £5,500 by
the quotient as per (p)
i.e. £5,500 2 = £2,750.
The taxpayer would therefore be
assessed on £5,500 at the rate
applicable to an income of £2,750.
Example C.— (Illustrating case under
section 80 (1) (6) (ii).)
(a) Assume premium £12,000 received for
four years unexpired period of a
lease—£l2,ooo.
(b) Assume £9,000 was paid two years
earlier when the original lease for
6 years was acquired.
(c) Then £6,000 represents the proportion
of the original £9,000 paid which
is attributable to the four years un-
expired term of the lease. This
£6,000 is a deduction allowable under
section 85 of the Act as directly
relating to the premium of £12,000
received.
(d) Assume other deductions directly
relating to the sale of the lease are—
Legal expenses and stamp
duty .. .. 50
Commission .. .. 300
(e) The “net premium” of this lease then
would be—
'£ £ £
(a) .. .. 12,000
less (c) .. 6,000
(n) .. 350
6,350
5,650
(f) Assume premium of £3,000 f
received for a five years’
lease of another property.
(0) Assume deductions directly
relating to the sale of this
lease are—
Legal expenses and £
stamp duty .. 25
Commission .. 75
(h) The net premium of this lease
then would be—
£
(f) .. .. 3,000
less(c) .. .. 100
2,900
8,550
(1) Assume loss on business £
carried on by tax-
payer .. .. 1,400
Concessional deduc-
tions .. .. 100
1,500
Taxable income .. 7,050
(j) The notional income would then be
ascertained by—
(i) Apportioning the taxable in-
come between the net pre-
miums in proportion to their
amounts—
Lease (a) 5650
X 7050 = 4659
8550
Lease (f) 2900
X 7050 = 2391
8550
£7050
(ii) These amounts are then to be
divided by one-twenty-
fourth of the number of
complete months in each
lease, viz.:—
24
Lease (a) 4659 X = 2329
48
24
Lease (r) 2391 X = 056
60
£3285
The taxpayer would therefore be assessed
on a taxable income of £7,050 at the rata
applicable to £3,285.




dividing each of the net premiums by one twenty-fourth
of the number of complete months in the term of the
lease.
(6) Where the taxable income is less than the net premium, or
the sum of the net premiums if there are more than one
of the premiums so included, the notional income shall
be—
(i) where there is only one of those premiums—the
amount ascertained by dividing the taxable
income by one twenty-fourth of the number of
complete months in the term of the lease; and
(ii) where there are more than one of those premiums
the sum of the amounts ascertained by appor-
tioning the taxable income among the net
premiums in proportion to their amounts, and
dividing the amount so apportioned to each net
premium by one twenty-fourth of the number
of complete months in the term of the lease.
(2.) This section shall not apply in any case—
(a) where the taxpayer is a company, except where, in respect
of the premium, it is assessable as a trustee; or( A )
( b ) where the provisions of Division 16 of this part are applied
in the assessment of the taxpayer.( B )
87.—(1.) Where improvements, not subject to tenant rights, have
been made upon any land by any person as consideration for the
grant to him of a lease of that land, or by a lessee of the land who was
required to make them under the provisions of the lease, or who made
them with the written consent of the lessor, the following provisions
shall apply:—(°)
(a) There shall be included in the lessor’s assessable income
of the year in which the improvements have been made,
and of each year thereafter until and including the year
in which the lease expires, an instalment of the estimated
value to the lessor of such improvements as at the
expiration of the lease. The instalments shall be equal
in amount and shall be such that, if received at the
commencement of each of those years they would, with
interest at the rate prescribed, accumulate to a sum
equal to the estimated value:
Value of
Improvement*
Included In
assessable
income.
(A) This section is inserted because it
was not necessary to provide for any
average rate of tax for companies, since a
flat rate is applicable to them.
(B) Neither will primary producers, in
whose interests the present averaging pro-
visions based on a 5-years’ income are
retained, in sections 149 to 158 of the
1936 Act, require any other average rate.
(C) This is a now provision in the Com-
monwealth Act based on the recommenda-
tion of the Royal Commission. A deduc-
tion is given in section 88 (2) in the cir-
cumstances specified, for money expended
by a lessee in effecting improvements on
leased land, and as such improvements are
regarded as inuring for the benefit of the
lessor, it is considered only equitable that
where a special deduction is allowed to the
lessee, the lessor should be assessed on the
value to him of the improvements as at the
expiration of the lease. The section, how


ever, will not apply to improvements
effected under leases entered into prior to
the commencement of this Act.
The following is an example illustrating
how the annual instalment will be ascer-
tained :
(a) Assume lease expires 15 years hence.
(b) Assume value of improvements at
the expiration of the lease is
found to be £30,000.
(c) Rate of interest as prescribed is
5 per cent, (regulation 8).
The sura which, if invested annually at
5 per cent, per annum would amount to
£1 at the end of 15 years, is £.044,135 (see
table in the Second Schedule to the Regula-
tions).
Amount of the instalment to be included
in the lessor’s assessable income for each
of the fifteen years would be—
£.044,135 X £30,000 = £1,324.


Provided that, where in the year of income, a person
is the lessor for part only of a year, a proportionate part
of the instalment shall be _ included in his assessable
income.
(Z>) Where, in the opinion of the Commissioner, the instalment
cannot be satisfactorily determined, the value of the
improvements at the expiration of the lease shall be
included in the lessor’s assessable income of the year
in which the lease expires .
(2.) This section shall not apply where the agreement under
which improvements were made as consideration for the grant of a
lease was entered into before the commencement of this Act or where
the lessee is required to make the improvements under the terms of
a lease entered into before such commencement, or where the improve-
ments are made in pursuance of a consent given before such commence-
ment or in any of the cases specified in sub-section (3.) of the next
succeeding section.
88.—(1.) Where a taxpayer has paid any premium in respect of
land, premises or machinery used for the purpose of producing
assessable income, and in the year of income—
(a) he is the lessee of the land, premises or machinery; or
(&) in the ease of a premium paid for the surrender of the
lease, he would have been the lessee had the lease been
transferred to him and he had not been entitled to the
reversion,
(A)
a proportionate part of the amount of that premium, arrived at by
distributing that amount proportionately over the period of the lease
unexpired at the date when the premium was paid, shall be an
allowable deduction.
Deductions to
lessee.
(A) Paragraph (hi of section 88 (1)
deals with the case of a premium paid for
the surrender of a lease. There was
already a deduction for this in the
proviso to section 10 (d) of the
previous Act, which is repeated in section
8.") (1) of the 1936 Act, hut that deduction
is only given in respect of a premium


SECTION 12.—VALUE OF IMPROVEMENTS INCLUDED IN
ASSESSABLE INCOME.
Provided that, where in the year of income, a person is the
lessor for part only of a year, a proportionate part of the instalment
shall he included in his assessable income, two or more persons have
been lessors for successive periods the instalment shall be included
in the assessable income of the last of those lessors.
Explanatory Note :
Section 87 (1.) of the Principal Act provides that a lessor of land on which
improvements have been effected by the lessee shall he assessed on an annual
instalment of the estimated value of the improvements at the date of expiration
of the lease.
The proviso to Section 87 (1.) was designed to apply in the year in which a sale
of the reversion was made. In the year of sale the annual instalment was assessable
pro rata to the vendor and the purchaser.
It has been found upon examination that the proviso in that form applied
also in a manner in which it was not intended to apply, viz., in a year in which sale
was not made but the lease existed for part of the year only.
It is only in rare instances that leases expire on 30th June in any year, so that
in most cases in the first and last years of the lease, the lessor would be lessor for part
only of the income year. In those cases the intention of section 87 (I.) (a) was that
the lessor be assessed on a full annual instalment (calculated on the number of income
years affected) to complete the assessment to him of the total amount of assessable
income contemplated by the section. Under the proviso to section 87 (1.), however,
portion only of the annual instalment could he assessed to the lessor in the first and
last years of the lease.
Section 12 not only corrects this flaw in the proviso but also simplifies its
application. By providing that in any year in which two or more persons have
been lessors the instalment shall be assessed to the last of the lessors, the liability
for assessment in the year of a sale of the reversion is definitely fixed upon the
purchaser. In so fixing the liability the apportionment of the instalment as between
vendor and purchaser is avoided.
Generally speaking, the purchaser may not be regarded as being unfairly treated
as, in the great majority of cases, the vendor in the first year of the leiase will have
home in a somewhat similar way an additional liability to assessment.
Moreover, the purchaser will be aware of his liability when arranging the terms
and conditions of his contract and will have the opportunity of taking the liability
into account.
It is considered further that, as the reversion rests with the purchaser, liability
to assessment in respect of the improvements on the leasehold land should also rest
with him.
SECTION 13.—DEDUCTIONS TO LESSEE.
Bg. *********




25. A deduction shall not, in any case, he made in respect of any
of the following matters: —
{») any wastage or depreciation of lease or in respect of any
loss occasioned by the expiration of any lease:
Provided that where it is proved to the satisfaction
of the Commissioner that any taxpayer (being the lessee
under a lease, or the transferee or assignee of a lease)
has paid any amount by way of royalty, bonus, fine,
premium or foregift or consideration in the nature of a
fine, premium or foregift for a lease, or a renewal of a
lease, or by way of consideration for the assignment or
transfer of a lease, of premises or machinery used by the
taxpayer for the production of income, including, in
either class of case, a sum which is attributable to the
assignment or transfer of goodwill or of a licence, the
taxpayer shall be entitled to a deduction from his
assessable income of the sum obtained by dividing the
amount so paid by the number of years of the unexpired
period of the lease at the date the amount was so paid
or if, after the date of such payment, the lease was
owned by the taxpayer during part only of the year in
which the income was derived, that part of the sum so
obtained which bears the same proportion to that sum
as that part of the year bears to a year, but so that the
aggregate of the deductions so allowed shall not exceed
the sum so paid if paid after the thirtieth day of June,
One thousand nine hundred and fourteen, or the part
of the sum so paid which is proportionate to the
paid for the surrender of a lease
for the purpose of assigning that lease.
The deduction in this section is to amortize
over the unexpired period of the lease the
premium paid for the surrender of the
lease, if the property is retained for the
purpose of producing assessable income.


“(2.) Where a taxpayer, who in the year of income is a lessee of
land used for the purpose of producing assessable income has, either
before or after the commencement of the lease, incurred expenditure
in making improvements not subject to tenant rights on that land,
and such improvements—
(а) have, under an agreement entered into after the commence-
ment of this Act, been made as consideration for the
grant to him of that lease;
(б) are improvements which he was required to make under the
provisions of that lease; or
(c) have been made with the written consent of the lessor given
after the commencement of this Act,( A )
a proportionate part of the amount of that expenditure arrived at by
distributing that amount proportionately over the period of the lease
unexpired at the date when the expenditure was incurred, shall be an
allowable deduction. In calculating the deduction under this' sub-
section, expenditure in excess of the amount, if any, specified in the
agreement for the lease, or in the lease, or in the lessor’s consent,
shall not be taken into account.
(3.) The provisions of the last preceding sub-section shall not
apply in any case—
(a) where the lease is a lease of land to a company from an
individual or from a company to an individual, and the
individual directly or indirectly controls the voting
power of the company;
(h) where the lessor is a trustee of the land for the lessee, or
the lessee is a trustee of the land for the lessor; or
(c) where the Commissioner is of the opinion that, in con-
sequence of the terms and conditions of the lease or of
any other circumstances, the lessor is in substantial
control of the operations of the lessee.
(4.)Where any taxpayer succeeds to any lease or share therein
upon the death of any person who has paid such premium or expended
such money, he shall be entitled to the same deduction, or part thereof
proportionate to his share in the lease, as that person would have
been entitled to under this section had he lived.
89.—This Division shall not apply to any lease from the Com-
monwealth or a State, being a perpetual lease without revaluation,
or a lease with a right of purchase.
Not to apply
to certain
eases.
(A) In addition to a deduction for
improvements which the lessee is required
to make under the terms of the lease, a
deduction is now provided under this
section for improvements made with the
written consent of the lessor.
As under section 87 the lessor will be
assessable on the value to him of the


(2.) Where a taxpayer, who in the year of income is a lessee of land used for
the purpose of producing assessable income has, either before or after the
commencement of the lease, incurred expenditure in making improvements not
subject to tenant rights on that land,-and such improvements—
(o) have, under an agreement entered into after the commencement of this
Act, been made as consideration for the grant to him of that lease ;
(b) are improvements which he was required to make under the provisions
of that lease ; or
(c) have been made with the written consent of the lessor given after the
commencement of this Act, - ’
a proportionate part of the amount of that expenditure arrived at by distributing
that amount proportionately over the period of the lease unexpired at the date when
the expenditure was incurred, shall be an allowable deduction. In calculating the
deduction under this sub-section, expenditure in excess of the amount, if any,
specified in the agreement for the lease, or in the lease, or in the lessor’s consent,
shall not be taken into account.
(3.) The provisions of the last preceding sub-section shall not apply in any case—
(a) where the lease is a lease of land to a company from an individual
or from a company to an individual, and the individual directly
'or indirectly controls the voting power of the company; pr
(b) where the lessor is a trustee of the land for the lessee or the lessee is a trustee
of the land for the lessor; or
(c) where the Commissioner is of the opinion that, in consequence of the
terms and conditions of the lease or of Sny other circumstances,
the lessor is in substantial control of the operations of the lessee
or the lessee is in substantial control of the operations of the lessor.
Explanatory Note: —
Section 88 (2.) of the Principal Act provides for a deduction to a lessee of the
cost of improvements effected by him under the provisions of the lease. Section
88 (3.) provides that the deduction shall not be granted in certain specific types of
cases where, in effect, the lessor is in substantial control of the operations of the
lessee. Paragraph (6) of the sub-section specified the case where the lessor is a trustee
of the land for the lessee or the lessee is a trustee of the land for the lessor.
The limitation specified in paragraph (b) of the sub-section would prevent tie
allowance of a deduction in future assessments in those cases in which the deduction
has been enjoyed in the past by a beneficiary who entered into his lease and building
covenant with the trustee in a perfectly bona fide manner and without intent to gain
any particular taxation advantage.
Where a beneficiary, who takes a lease from the trustee and makes
the improvements, is a life tenant in the trust estate, he should not be
deprived of the deduction. The only case which requires serious consideration
is the case where the lessor and lessee are in effect the same person under the cloak
of a trust which, in most instances, would be found to be a device to evade taxation.
Such a case is, to some extent, met by paragraph (c) of sub-section (3.) of section
88 which has the effect of excluding from the right to the deduction the case “ where
the Commissioner is of opinion that in consequence of the terms and conditions'
of the lease or of any other circumstances the lessor is in substantial control of
the operations: of the lessee ”.
248.-2


It was considered -that if there were added the wordsor the lessee is in
substantial control of the operations of the lessor ”, the paragraph would sufficiently
guard against all the mifechief of any real importance that was aimed at by paragraph
(b) of the sub-section which could then safely be omitted. An amendment to this
effect has therefore been made. ■ ■' >
The amendment gives effect to a recommendation by Sir David Ferguson who
inquired into this matter.
SECTION 14. —CROWN LEASES OF LAND USED FOR PRIMARY
PRODUCTION.
88a —(1.) Except as provided in this section, the provisions of sections eighty-
four, eighty-five, eighty-six, eighty-seven and eighty-eight shall not apply to a lease
from the Crown of land used for primary production.
(2.) Where a lease from the Crown of land’used for primary production has been
assigned prior to the beginning of the first year to the income .of which this Act
applies and more than one premium in respect of that assignment is payable, the
assignor shall be subject to the same liability to tax, and the assignee shall be entitled
to the same right of deduction, in respect of any premiums paid during that or any
subsequent year, as they would have been if this section had not been enacted.
(3.),Where after the beginning of the first year to the income of which this
Act applies a taxpayer assigns a lease from the Crown of land used for primary
production, and the taxpayer has been allowed any deduction under this Act or any
previous law of the Commonwealth in respect of that lease, if the premium or sum
of the premiums for of in connexion with that assignment together with all
deductions so allowed, exceeds the premium or sum of the premiums paid by him
for the lease, together with the expenses directly incurred by him in effecting that
assignment (which expenses shall not otherwise be an allowable deduction), the
excess, to an amount not exceeding the sum of those deductions, (in this section
called the “assessable amount ”) shall be taken into account in the following
manner :
(a) Where the whole premium (or sum of the premiums, as the case may
be) is received by him in the year of income—the whole of the
assessable amount shall be included in his assessable income.
(b) Where part only of the sum of the premiums is received by him in
the year of income—a proportionate part of the assessable amount
shall be included in his assessable income.
(4.) Where a taxpayer, who in the year of income is the lessee from the Crown
of land used for primary production for the purpose of producing assessable income,
has, prior to the first day of January, One thousand nine hundred and thirty-seven,
paid any premium for or in connexion with the assignment to him of the lease, a
proportionate part of the amount of that premium, arrived at by distributing that
amount proportionately over the period of the lease unexpired at the date when the
premium was paid, shall be an allowable deduction.
(5.) Where a taxpayer, who in the year of income is the lessee from the Crown
of land used for primary production for the purpose of producing assessable income,
has incurred expenditure in making improvements, not subject to tenant rights,
which, prior to the first day of January, One thousand nine hundred and
thirty-seven, he was required to make under the provisions of the lease, a
proportionate part of the amount of that expenditure, arrived at by distributing


that amount proportionately over the period of the lease unexpired at the date
when the expenditure was incurred, shall be an allowable deduction. In calculating
the deduction under this sub-section, expenditure in excess of the amount, if any,
specified in the lease shall not be taken into account.
(6.) Where, upon the death of any person, a taxpayer succeeds to any lease
from the Crown of land used for primary production, or any share therein, the
following provisions shall apply
(a) In ascertaining the assessable amount for the purposes of sub-
section (3.) of this section—
(i) any premium paid by the deceased person for the lease, or
part thereof proportionate to the taxpayer’s share in the
lease ; or
(ii) any deduction allowed to the deceased person under this Act
or under any previous law of the Commonwealth in respect
of that lease, or part thereof proportionate to the taxpayer’s
share in the lease,
shall be taken into account as if the premium (or the. part thereof)
had been paid by or the deduction (or the part thereof) had been
allowed to the taxpayer.
(b) Where the deceased person had paid any premium as specified in sub-
section (4.) of this section or incurred any expenditure as specified
in sub-section (5.) of this section, the taxpayer shall be entitled to
the same deduction, or part thereof proportionate to his share in
the lease, as the deceased person would have been entitled to under
this section had he lived.
Explanatory Note :
The general question of the taxation of Crown leaseholds has been previously
referred to in the explanatory note to Section 10 of the Amending Act.
In his report on this question Sir David Ferguson recommended, in effect, that
Crown leases of land occupied for purposes of primary production should he treated
in the same manner as freeholds. As a consequence of the acceptance of this
recommendation the proceeds from the sale of a Crown lease would he treated as a
receipt of capital and not as income assessable to income tax. Similarly, the purchase
price of a Crown lease would not be allowable as a deduction in arriving at the taxable
income of the purchaser of the lease.
A further conclusion reached by Sir David Ferguson was that where the vendor
of a lease had received deductions in respect of any premium paid by him for the
lease, so much of the proceeds as represents the aggregate amount of the deductions
should be brought into his assessable income.
Sub-section (1.). This is a drafting clause.
Sub-section (2.). The provisions are not applicable to Crown leases assigned
prior to Ist July, 1935. With regard to transactions entered into prior to that
date any instalments of a premium received by the assignor of a lease will be assessable
income and the premium paid by the assignee will be an allowable deduction.
Sub-section (3.). This provision is designed to meet the case of a taxpayer
who, subsequently to Ist July, 1935, sells a Crown lease of land used for primary
production. As the taxpayer will have been allowed deductions in respect of any
premium paid by him, it is provided that he be assessed on the premium received
by him, but to no greater extent than the deductions allowed to him.

Sub-sections (4.) and (5.). The object of these two sub-sections is to provide for
the taxpayer who, prior to Ist January, 1937, purchases a lease or incurs
expenditure on improvements, not subject to tenant rights, on leasehold land.
Under the two sub-sections a proportionate deduction will be allowed annually to the
taxpayer in respect of the expenditure incurred by him either in purchasing the
lease or in effecting the improvements on the leasehold land.
Leasehold transactions entered into after the Ist January, 1937, will not be
subject to the provisions of these two sub-sections. The time allowed will provide
sufficient opportunity to taxpayers and their agents to acquaint themselves with
the amended provisions of the law.
Sub-section (6.). In this sub-section provision is made to meet the case of the
person or persons who succeed to a leasehold estate upon the death of another person.
The effect of the sub-section is that the beneficiary will be assessed on the same
amount and allowed the same deductions as the deceased person would have been
had he lived.

basis, and from it there shall be deducted — l

covenanted to be made on improvements on land by a
lessee who has no tenant rights in the improvements.
The deduction under this paragraph shall be ascertained
by dividing the amount (not exceeding the sum specified
in the covenant) expended on the improvements by the
lessee by the number of years in the unexpired period
of the lease at the date the improvements were effected.
This paragraph shall not apply in any case where
there is a lease of land to a company from any indi-
vidual, or from a company to any individual, who
directly or indirectly controls the voting power of the
company, or in any other case in which the Commis-
sioner is of the opinion that, in consequence of the terms
and conditions of the lease or of any circumstances
asociated with the lease, the lessor is in substantial
control of the operations of the lessee;

Provided further that where any taxpayer succeeds
to any lease or share therein as a beneficiary upon the
death of any person, or in the course of the administra-
tion of the estate of any person, who, in the opinion of
the Commissioner, has paid for that lease any amount
of the nature specified in the first proviso to this para-
graph, the taxpayer shall be entitled to the same
deduction or part thereof (proportionate to his share
in the lease), as that person would have been entitled
to under that proviso had he lived:
25. (») The provisoes of this paragraph shall not apply—
(o) to any lease from the Commonwealth or a State being a
perpetual lease without revaluation or a lease with a
right of purchase; or
(5) to entitle a company to a deduction in respect of any
amount paid by the company to any person in the
form of shares in that company, except where the
shares have been sold by that person, and the sale price
is, by virtue of paragraph ( d ) of section sixteen of this
improvements as at the expiration of the
lease, the provision in respect of improve-
ments effected with the written consent of
the lessor will not apply but only where
the consent of the lessor is given after the
commencement of the 1936 Act.


Division s.—Partnerships.
90. In this Division—< B )
“ net income ” in relation to a partnersip, means the assessable
income of the partnership, calculated as if the partnership
were a taxpayer, less all allowable deductions except the
concessional deductions, the statutory exemption, and
losses of previous years;
“ partnership loss ” means the excess, if any, of the allowable
deductions, except the concessional deductions, the
statutory exemption and losses of previous years, over the
assessable income of a partnership, calculated as if the
partnership were a taxpayer.
91. A partnership shall furnish a return of the income of the
partnership, but shall not, except as provided in this Division, be
liable to pay tax thereon.
92. —(1.) The assessable income of a partner shall include his
individual interest in the net income of the partnership of the year
of income, and his individual interest in a partnership loss incurred
in the year of income shall be an allowable deduction.
(2.) The exempt income of a partner shall include his individual
interest in the exempt income of the partnership of the year of
income.
93. (1.) In calculating the net income of a partnership or
a partnership loss for the purpose of assessing any partner’s share,
the partnership shall be deemed to have exercised or failed to exercise
all options and rights to select a value for live stock -under this Act
in the same manner as the partner has in fact exercised or failed
to exercise those options and rights, and the partnership shall not,
as a partnership, be entitled to exercise any such option or right. (°)

(A) The omission of this sub-section in
the 1936 Act is explained by the notes to
the definition of “premium” (section 83).
(B) These definitions were inserted for
the simplification of the drafting. They
bring into existence no new principle or
practice.
(C) Section 93 specifically provides for
the options and elections under the various
sections to be made by the indivi-
dual partner and not by the partner-
ship. It is, of course, practicable for each
partner to exercise the option in the
same manner and thus obtain one
and the same basis of valuation for

pany shall be entitled to a deduction under the first
proviso to this paragraph in respect of the amount
paid by the purchaser of those shares as if it were an
amount paid by the company as specified in that
proviso ;(A)
29.—(1.) A partnership shall be liable to furnish a return in
respect of the income of the partnership but shall not, except as
provided in this section, be liable to pay tax, but each partner shall
be assessed in his individual capacity in respect of—
(o) his individual interest in the income of the partnership
which, if the partnership were liable to pay tax, would
have been the income of the partnership remaining:
after allowing all the deductions under this Act, except
the deductions under section twenty-four and under sub-
section (2.) of section twenty-six, together with
( h ) any other income derived by him separately, and
(c) his individual interests in the income derived by any other
partnership:
the partnership, but the elasticity of this
section takes away any possible complaint
by one partner that he is prejudiced by
the exercise of another partner’s decision.
Under the previous Act, there was not
uniformity in this matter, and in some
cases the partnership and in others the
partners exercised the options. If at a
future date two persons, each of whom
had previously exercised the option
in a different manner, go into partner-
ship, either nr both of them may in
the interests of uniformity apply for leave
of the Commissioner to exercise afresh the
options and rights to select values for live
stock.


(2.) The fact that a taxpayer has entered into a partnership, or
that any variation has taken place in the membership of any
partnership of which the taxpayer is a member shall not—
(а) affect any option or any right to select a value for live
stock previously exercised by him under this Act; or
(б) confer upon him any right to alter .any such option or
value without the leave of the Commissioner.
(3.) Where, in respect of a partnership formed before the com-
mencement of this Act, a basis of valuation of live stock of the
partnership had, before that commencement, been accepted by the
Commissioner for the purposes of the previous Act, nothing in this
section shall be deemed to vary, or require the variation of, that
basis of valuation unless or until there is an alteration in the
membership of that partnership. (A)
94.'—(1.) Where a partnership is so constituted or controlled, or
its operations are so conducted, that any partner has not the real
and effective control and disposal of his share of the net income of
the partnership, the Commissioner may assess the additional amount
of tax that would be payable if the share of that partner, or of all
such partners if more than one, had been received by the other
partner, if only one, or divided between the other partners, if more
than one, in proportion to their respective interests in the partnership,
and had been added to and included in his or their assessable income,
and the partnership shall be liable to pay the tax so assessed. < B )
(2.) Where the provisions of this section are applied to a share of
the net income of a partnership, that share shall not be included in
the assessable income of any partner.
(3.) For the purpose of this section, but without limiting its
application, a partner shall be deemed not to have the real or effective
control and disposal of any money received by him which is applied
to meet the private or domestic obligations of any other partner.
Partner not
In receipt and
control of shari.
(A) This sub-section, in effect, provides
that the basis of valuation adopted by a
partnership under the previous Act is not
in any way to be affected by the pro-
visions in sub-sections (1) and (2).
Section 33 provides for the continuation of
whatever basis of valuation was adopted
under the previous Act (e.g. market
or cost), unless a change is made with
the Commissioner’s consent. Where the
partnership elected the basis of cost
price, the new range of cost prices for
future natural increase will of course be
open for the election of the individual
partner under section 34 (1) (6).


Provided that where in a partnership formed after the thirteenth
day of September One thousand nine hundred and fifteen any
partner is not a taxpayer and the Commissioner is not satisfied that
that partner is in receipt and control of his share of the income, the
partnership shall be assessed and liable, on behalf of that partner,
for income tax on his individual interest in the income of the partner-
ship under paragraph (a) of this section, at the rate which would
be applicable to a taxable income equal to the income of the partner-
ship remaining after allowing the deductions allowed under this Act.
(2.) Where the Commissioner is of opinion that a partnership
between husband and wife or between two or more husbands and
any or all of their wives, or between relatives by blood, marriage or
adoption, was formed or has been varied for the purpose of relieving
any member thereof specified by the Commissioner from any liability
to which he would have been subject under this Act if the partnership
had not been formed, and that that purpose is effective in the year
in which the income was derived or where there is a trust which
is a partnership as defined in section four of this Act, the partnership
shall be assessed as if it were a single person without regard to the
interests therein of any of the partners or to any deductions to which
any of them should be entitled under this Act, and shall—
(a) if there is only one such member or if it is such a trust—
be deemed to be an individually owned partnership; or
(b) if there are two or more such members—be deemed to be a
severally owned partnership.
(B) As stated in the note referring to
the definition of “partnership” in section
G, it lias been decided that the purpose for
which a partnership is formed should not
be.the deciding factor in determining its
bona fides, but that the test should be
whether, in fact, the partnership is bona
3924.-5
fide or fictitious. Section 29(2) of the
previous Act has therefore been deleted
from the 1936 Act and the proviso to
section 29 (1) revised. The income of a
family partnership, which is not a bona
fide one, will still be assessed to the partner-
ship.


Division 6.—Trustees.
95. In this Division, “ the net income of a trust estate ” means the
total assessable income of the trust estate calculated under this Act as
if the trustee were a taxpayer in respect of that income, less all
allowable deductions —
(a) except the concessional deductions and the statutory
exemption; and
(h) except also in respect of any beneficiary who has no
beneficial interest in the corpus of the trust estate, or in
respect of any life tenant, the deduction of such of the
losses of previous years as are required to be met out
of corpus.
96. Except as provided in this Act, a trustee shall not be liable as
trustee to pay income tax upon the income of the trust estate.
97. —(1.) Where any beneficiary is presently entitled to a share
of the income of a trust estate and is not under any legal disability,
his assessable income shall include that share of the net income of
the trust estate.
(2.) The exempt income of any such beneficiary shall include his
individual interest in the exempt income of the trust estate, except to
the extent to which that exempt income is taken into account in
calculating the net income of the trust estate.
98. Where any beneficiary is presently entitled to a share of the
income of a trust estate but is under a legal disability, the trustee
shall be assessed and liable to pay tax in respect of that share of the
net income of the trust estate as if it were the income of an individual,
and were not subject to any deduction other than the concessional
deductions which would have been allowable to the beneficiary if he
had been assessed in respect of that share, and the statutory
exemption. ( A )

preceding sub-section applies shall be at such rates as are declared
by the Parliament.
(4.) Any member of a partnership to which sub-section (2.) of
this section applies shall not be assessed, under the provisions of sub-
section (1.) of this section, in his individual capacity in respect of his
individual interest in the income of that partnership.
31.—(1.) A trustee, other than a trustee of a trust which is a •
partnership as defined by section four of this Act, shall not be liable
to pay tax as trustee, except as provided by this Act, but each
beneficiary who is not under a legal disability and who is presently
entitled to a share of the income of the trust estate shall be assessed
in his individual capacity in respect of—
(o) his individual interest in the income of the trust estate,
which if the trustee were liable to pay the tax in respect
of the income of the trust estate, would have been the
income of the trust estate remaining after allowing all
the deductions under this Act, except the deduction
under section twenty-four and, where the beneficiary has
no beneficial interest in the corpus of the estate, except
the deduction under section twenty-six in respect of any
loss which is required to be met out of the corpus;
together with
(5) any other income derived by him separately; and
(c) his individual interests in the income derived from any
other source.
31. —(2.) A trustee shall be separately assessed and liable to pay
tax in respect of that part of the income of the trust estate which if
the trustee were liable to pay tax in respect of the income of the
trust estate, would have been the income of the trust estate, remaining
after allowing all the deductions under this. Act, except the deduction
under section twenty-four, and

tion has been rectified in the re-draft of

or on that part of that net income as the case may be, as if it were
the income of an individual, and were not subject to any deduction
other than the' statutory exemption.
100. —(1.) The assessable income of any beneficiary who is under
a legal disability, and who is a beneficiary in more than one trust
estate, or derives income from any other source, shall include his
individual interest in the net income of the trust estate or estates.
(2.) There shall be deducted from the income tax assessed against
such beneficiary the tax paid or payable by any trustee in respect of
that beneficiary’s interest in the net income of the trust estate.
101. For the purposes of this Division, where a trustee has a
discretion to pay or apply income of a trust estate to or for the benefit
of specified beneficiaries, a beneficiary in whose favour the trustee
exercises his discretion shall be deemed to be presently entitled to the
amount paid to him or applied for his benefit by the trustee in the
exercise of that discretion.( A )
102. — (1.) Where a person has created a trust in respect of any
income or income-producing assets, and he has a power, whenever
exercisable, to revoke or alter the trusts so as to acquire a beneficial
interest in the income derived during the year of income, or the
assets producing that income or any part of that income or of those
assets, the Commissioner may assess the trustee to pay income tax,
under this section, and the trustee shall be liable to pay the tax so
assessed. ( B >

(A) In many cases whore no person is
presently entitled to the income ot a trust
estate, the beneficiaries contingently
entitled are children, and the trustees have,
either under the trust instrument, or the
general law, power to expend or advance
money, for the maintenance, education and
advancement in life of the infants. Where
this power is exercised, it is considered
that so much of the income as is applied
for the purposes mentioned in respect of
each child should be treated as income to
which that child is presently entitled, and
taxed to the trustee accordingly. This is
provided for in section 101, which is an
extension of the provisions set out in sec-
tion 31 (4) of the previous Act.
(B) Section 102 has inserted in
the Act on the advice of the Eoyal
Commission. Section 93 of the previous


31. —(3.) A beneficiary who is under a legal disability, and who
is a beneficiary in more than one trust estate, or derives income from
any other source, shall be assessed in his individual capacity in
respect of—
(а) his individual interest, upon which the trustee is liable to
be assessed under sub-section (2.) of this section, in the
income of each trust estate;
(б) any other income derived by him separately; and
(c) his individual interests in the income derived from any
other source:
Provided that there shall be deducted from the tax assessed
against the beneficiary the tax paid by any trustee in respect of the
"beneficiary’s interest in the income of a trust estate.
(4.) For the purposes of this section, where by any deed, will or
settlement a trustee is required to hold the income of a trust fund
in trust for the beneficiaries specified therein in such manner as he
in his absolute discretion thinks fit, a beneficiary in whose favour the
trustee exercises his discretion shall be deemed to be presently
entitled to the amount of the income of the year paid to him by the
trustee in the exercise of his discretion under the deed, will or
settlement.
Act went a certain distance to pre-
vent evasion of tax by contracts,
agreements or arrangements, which are
not bona fide. But the Royal Commis-
sion considers that no person, by the crea-
tion of a trust, should be able to avoid
taxation just as and when it suits him, by
retaining a power of revocation over the
property claimed to have been transferred.
It is an inalienable right of every person
to transfer his property at will and thereby
reduce his taxation, but where the settlor
has the power of revocation which he can
exercise in respect of the income of any
year, evasion of tax is to be frustrated
by making the trustee liable for the
additional tax the settlor would be liable
to pay if the property had not been so
transferred.


(2.) The amount of such tax shall be the amount by which the
tax actually payable on his own taxable income by the person who
created the trust is less than the tax which would have been payable
by him if he had received so much of the net income of the trust
estate as is attributable to the beneficial interest which he had power
so to acquire, in addition to any other income derived by him.
(3.) Where this section is applied to the assessment of the income
of a trust estate or part thereof derived in the year of income, no
beneficiary shall be assessed in his individual capacity in respect of
his individual interest in the income or part to which this section has
been so applied, and the trustee shall not be assessed in respect of
that income or part otherwise than under this section.

103.— (1.) In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears— •
“ distributable income ” means the amount obtained by deduct-
ing from the taxable income of a company all taxes, which,

which would have been a sufficient distribution.
31a.— (2.) For the purposes of this Division—
(o) a company shall be deemed to be a company in which the
public are substantially interested if shares of the
company (not being shares entitled to a fixed rate of
dividend, whether with or without a further right to

tributable income.
104.—(1.) Where a private company has not, before the expira-
tion of nine months after the close of the year of income, made a
sufficient distribution of its income of the year, the Commissioner
may assess the aggregate additional amount of tax which would
have been payable by its shareholders if the company had, on the
last day of the year of income, paid the undistributed amount as a
dividend to the shareholders who would have been entitled to
receive it, and the company shall be liable to pay the tax so assessed.
(2.) Where there is more than one class of shareholders of the

amount to and by each of any companies, trustees or partnerships
interposed between the private company and that person, the Com-
missioner may also, in addition to any other tax assessable under this
Division, assess the additional amount of tax, if any, which would
in that event have been payable by that person, and the private
company shall be liable to pay the tax so assessed.
(2.) If any company so interposed between the private company
and that person is not incorporated in Australia, and the Commis-
sioner is unable to ascertain the identity of that person, or the part
of the amount which he would have received, the Commissioner may
assess the additional amount of tax, if any, which would have been
payable if the company so interposed had only one shareholder,
and the private company shall be liable to pay the tax so assessed.
106.— (1.) Where the total amount of dividends paid by a

31d. —(1.) Where in relation to any private company there is
an undistributed amount, and any person (not being a company,
trustee or partnership) would, otherwise than as a shareholder of
the private company, have received a part of that amount if there
had been successive distributions of the relative parts of that amount
to and by each of any companies, trustees or partnerships interposed
between the private company and that person, the Commissioner may,
in addition to any tax assessed under section thirty-one b of this
Act assess the tax and additional tax, if any, which would in that
event have been payable by that person, and the private company shall
be liable to pay the tax and additional tax so assessed.
(2.) If any company so interposed between the private company
and that person is not incorporated in Australia, and the Commis-
sioner is unable to ascertain the identity of that person, or the part of
the amount which he would have received, the Commissioner may
assess the tax or aditional tax, if any, which would have been payable
if the company so interposed had only one shareholder, and the
private company shall be liable to pay the tax or aditional tax so
assessed.

calculating the undistributed amount, be deemed to be a dividend
paid out of the taxable income of the year of income.
(2.) For the purpose of calculating the excess—
(а) any part of the company’s taxable income of that period
upon which it has paid or is liable to pay tax under
this Division, or under section twenty-one of the
previous Act, or under Division 2 of Part 111. of that
Act, shall he deemed to be a dividend paid by the com-
pany during that period; and
(б) any dividend or part of a dividend paid out of that part
of the company’s taxable income shall he deemed not
to be a dividend.
107. A person shall be entitled to a rebate of the amount by
which his income tax is increased by the inclusion in his assessable
income of—
(a) dividends paid to him by a company; or
(Z>) amounts in respect of dividends paid by a company to
any company, trustee or partnership interposed between
that person and the company paying the dividends
where the dividends are paid wholly and exclusively out of any
amount or amounts in respect of which, under this under
section twenty-one of the previous Act or under Division 2 of Part
111. of that Act, the company paying the dividends has paid or is
liable to pay tax.( A )
108. —(1.) If any amounts are advanced or any assets distributed
by a private company to any of its shareholders by way of advances or
loans, or any payment is made by the company on behalf of, or for
the individual benefit of, any of its shareholders, so much, if any, of
those advances loans or payment, as in the opinion of. the Commis-
sioner, represents distributions of income shall, for all purposes of
this Act, be deemed to be dividends paid by the company to those
shareholders out of profits derived by it.
(2.) Where the amount of any advance, loan or payment is
deemed, under the last preceding sub-section, to be a dividend paid
by a company to its shareholders, and in any year subsequent to
that in which the dividend is so deemed to be paid, the company
sets off any dividend distributed by it in that subsequent year, in

(A) Section 31f adequately provided for
the proper rebate where the distribution
was made direct to the shareholder by a com-
pany paying tax under section 31b. It did
not provide, however, for any rebate where
there had been successive distributions
through companies, trustee 1 ! or partnerships
interposed between the company making the
distribution and the ultimate individual
recipient, where the provisions of section
31d had been applied.
This anomaly has been rectified in sec-
tion 107 of the 1930 Act. If there is any
company, trustee or partnership inter-
posed between the company paying tax
under section 105 and the individual
shareholder, then paragraph (6) of sec-
tion 107 applies to grant the rebate.

undistributed amount, be deemed to be a dividend paid out of the
taxable income of the year of income.
(2.) For the purpose of calculating the excess—
(а) any part of the company’s taxable income of that period
upon which it has paid or is liable to pay tax under this
Division or under section twenty-one of the Income Tax
Assessment Act 1922 as in force at any time at which,
prior to the commencement of this section, the company
so paid or so became liable to pay tax shall be deemed to
be a dividend paid by the company during that period;
and
(б) any dividend or part of a dividend paid out of that part of
the company’s taxable income shall be deemed not to be
a dividend.
31f. A shareholder of any company shall be entitled to a rebate
of the amount by which his income tax is increased by the inclusion
in his assessable income of—
(o) so much of the dividends paid to him by the company
before the commencement of this section as is paid out
of any amount or amounts in respect of which the com-
pany has paid or is liable to pay tax under this Division
or under section twenty-one of the Income Tax Assess-
ment Act 1922 as in force at any time at which, prior to
the commencement of this section, the company so paid
or so became liable to pay tax; and( A >
(6) dividends paid to him by the company after the commence-
ment of this section wholly and exclusively out of any
such amount or amounts.
31g.— (1.) If any amounts are advanced or any assets distributed
by a private company to any of its shareholders by way of advances
or loans, or any payment is made by the company on behalf of, or
for the individual benefit of, any of its shareholders so much, if any
of those advances, loans or payment as, in the opinion of the Com-
missioner, represents distributions of income shall, for all purposes
of this Act, be deemed to be dividends paid by the company to those
shareholders.
(2.) "Where the amount of any advance, loan or payment is
deemed, under the last preceding sub-section, to be a dividend paid

Mutual Insurance Associations formed to
conduct on behalf of their members the
business of insurance other than life
assurance.
The decisions of the Courts applicable to
mutual associations are to the effect that
the contributions of members of the associa-
tion are not income of the association in
the absence of a specific provision to the
contrary. As these associations are in
active competition with other companies
transacting this class of business, it is
considered that they should be liable to
taxation on the net income derived by them


22. In connexion with income derived from mining operations
(other than coal mining) carried on in Australia, the following
provisions shall apply:—
(a) the return required by this Act to be made by the person
deriving the income in the first place shall show the total
income so derived during the accounting period in
respect of which the return is compiled;
(&) the capital expended by the person carrying on the mining
operations in necessary plant and development of a
mining property from which income has been received
(less the distributed and undistributed income derived
by that person prior to the financial year for which
income tax is being levied) shall be divided by the esti-
mated number of years during which payable mining
operations may be expected to continue under normal
conditions, and the quotient thus obtained shall, in addi-
tion to any other deductions allowed by this Act, be
deducted from the income;
(c) as an alternative to the deduction allowable by the last
preceding paragraph, there shall, at the option of the
taxpayer, be deducted so much of the income of the
accounting period as is expended in that year for
development or is appropriated for development (the
cost of which is not deductible under section twenty-
three of this Act) and for new plant:
Provided that any of the money so appropriated
which has not been expended for that purpose at the end
of the year in which it was appropriated shall be liable
to tax as income of that year;
Provided further that no deduction under paragraph
( e) of sub-section (1.) of section twenty-three of this
Act shall be allowed on any new plant to which this
paragraph applies.

(B) The general provisions of the
previous Act regarding the special deduc-
tions allowed to Mining Companies for
plant and development have not been
changed. As these provisions give a
special deduction in respect of plant and
machinery, a further deduction for depre-
ciation on such plant and machinery is
, not allowable. The previous Act contained a
drafting defect in excising the depreciation
allowance only from plant coming under
the second of the alternative clauses. This
is corrected in section 124 of the 1938 Act.

(3.) Where a company establishes, to the satisfaction of the
Commissioner, that a person can enforce payment, without any
deduction under this section, of interest on any such money secured by
debentures, or on money lodged at interest with it, this section shall
not apply in respect of the interest paid or credited to that person.
(4.) This section shall not apply to interest paid or credited to a
company which is carrying on business in Australia, and which has
a public officer duly appointed under this Act, unless the Commis-
sioner, by notice in writing to the company paying or crediting the
interest, directs that the section shall so apply. f°)

tax upon the total amount so paid or credited in respect of those
debentures at the rate of tax which would be applicable if that
amount were the taxable income of one individual.

(A) Section 20 (2) (h) (ii) of the pre-
vious Act provided for the taxation of
interest on money raised by debentures and
used in Australia. If the money is used
in acquiring assets for use in Australia,
e.g. the purchase of plant or trading stock,
it is obvious the section should have equal
application. Section 125 (I) (o) of the
1936 Act therefore includes specific wording
for this purpose.
(E) The allowance of the statutory
exemption was extended to non-residents
under section 81, and as a corollary, under
section 125 (1) provision has been made,
in the ease of interest payable by a com-
pany to individual non-residents, for the

which the money is raised by debentures is one

the laws of the Commonwealth or of a State.
Provided that a company shall be entitled to deduct and retain

(C) This section modifies the provisions
of the previous Act, by regarding a com-
pany' which is carrying on business in
Australia with a duly appointed public
officer as a resident for the purposes of
this Pivision, even though the Head
Office and control may be out of Australia.
Such a company brings all interest receiv-
able to account in its taxation return:
but without the modification inserted by
this section, the company would still be
liable for taxation on this interest, even
though it suffered a loss in a particular
year in its ordinary trading transactions.


(2.) The company may deduct and retain for its own use from
the amount payable to any person who is a holder of any of those
debentures an amount bearing the same proportion to the amount
of tax payable by the company under this section as the interest
payable to that person bears to the total interest payable in respect
of those debentures.
(3.) Where the Commissioner is satised that that person is not
liable to furnish a return, he shall refund to him the amount of tax
paid by the company in respect of his debentures.
127. Where the company pays tax under this Division on any
interest, and that interest is included in the, assessment of the
person to whom it was paid or credited, the proportionate amount
of tax paid by the company in respect of the interest shall be deducted
from the total tax payable by that person.
128. Where in any financial year interest is paid by a company in
respect of which it is liable under this Division to pay income tax,
the company shall be liable for income tax on that interest to the
extent to which it would have been so liable if an assessment had
been made in respect of that interest at the date when it was paid.( A >
Division 12.—Oversea Ships.(°)
129. Where a ship belonging to or chartered by a person whose
principal place of business is out of Australia carries passengers,
live stock, mails or goods shipped in Australia, five per centum of
the amount paid or payable to him in respect of such carriage,
whether that amount is payable in or out of Australia, shall be
deemed to be taxable income derived by him in Australia.
130. The master of the ship, or the agent or other representative
in Australia of the owner or charterer, shall, when called upon by the
Commissioner by notice in the Gazette or by any other notice to
him, make a return of the amount so paid or payable.

(A) This Section removes some of the
difficulties experienced by a taxpayer
(usually a Bank) in paying taxation at the
source on the class of interest described.
To save vexatious adjustments with
clients, irrespective of whether an altera-
tion in the rate of tax is an increase or
a decrease, it is considered more satisfac-
tory to provide for this deduction at the
source to be made at the rate of tax
operating at the time when all such
interest is paid. The limitation of the

amount which bears the same proportion to the amount paid by the
company under paragraph (c) of this sub-section as the interest
payable to that person bears to the total interest payable in respect
cf those debentures:
20. —(2.) Provided further that, where the Commissioner is
satisfied that the holder of debentures payable to bearer is a person
who is not liable to furnish a return, the Commissioner may refund to
that person the amount of the tax paid by the company in respect
of the debentures of that person:
Provided further that where a company pays tax under this sub-
section on any interest and that interest is also included in the
assessment of the person to whom it was paid or credited the propor-
tionate amount of tax paid by the company in respect of the interest
shall be deducted from the total tax payable by that person;
20. —(2.) Provided further that, where in any financial year any
debentures are redeemed, or any money lodged at interest is with-
drawn, the rate of tax payable by the company in respect of the
interest paid thereon during that financial year shall be the rate
which would have been payable by the company in respect of that
interest if an assessment had been made in respect thereof at the date
upon which the debentures were redeemed, or the deposit withdrawn,
as the ease may be.
20. —(3.) A company, notwithstanding any contract, agreement,
or arrangement entered into by it, may, with the approval of the
Commissioner, charge pro rata the amount of the tax actually paid
by it against those beneficially interested in the income of the
■company. (B)

person shall, when called upon by the Commissioner by notice pub-
lished in the Gazette or by any other notice to him, make a return of
the full amount payable to the owner or charterer (whether such
amount be payable in or beyond Australia) in respect of the carriage
of the passengers, live stock, mails and goods.

thereon as agent for the owner or charterer and shall be liable to pay

132. The master, agent, or representative, as agent for the owner
or charterer, may be assessed upon the taxable income and shall be
liable to pay the tax assessed.
133. —(1.) Where the assessment is made on the agent or
representative, and the tax is not paid forthwith upon receipt of
notice of the assessment, the master shall be liable to pay the tax.
(2.) This section shall not, so long as any tax for which the master
becomes liable under this section remains unpaid, relieve any other,
person to whom notice of assessment has been given in respect of
that tax, from liability to pay the tax remaining unpaid.
134. Where any person is liable to pay tax under this Division,
the Commissioner shall give notice to him of the assessment, and he
shall forthwith pay the tax.
135. A collector or officer of customs for any State or Territory
of the Commonwealth shall not grant a clearance to the ship until he
is satisfied that any tax which has been or may be assessed under this
Division has been paid, or that arrangements for its payment have
been made to the satisfaction of the Commissioner.

136. Where any business carried on in Australia —
(a) is controlled principally by non-residents;

which is held by or on behalf of non-residents; or
(c) is carried on by a company which holds or on behalf of
which other persons hold a majority of the shares in a
non-resident company,
and it appears to the Commissioner that the business produces either
no taxable income or less than the amount of taxable income
which might be expected to arise from that business, the person
carrying on the business in Australia shall, notwithstanding any other
provision of this Act, be liable to pay income tax on a taxable income
of such amount of the total receipts (whether cash or credit) of the
business as the Commissioner determines. ( A )

controlled principally by persons resident outside Australia, and it
appears to the Commissioner that the business produces either no

the business in Australia shall be asessable and chargeable with
income tax on such percentage of the total receipts (whether cash

proper.

Division 15.—Insurance with Non-Residents.
141. In this Division —
“ insurance contract ” means a contract or guarantee whereby
liability is undertaken, contingent upon the happening
of any specified event, to pay any money or make good
any loss or damage, but does not include a contract of
life assurance;
“ insured event ” means an event upon the happening of
which the liability under an insurance contract arises;
“ insured person ” means a person with whom any insurance
contract is entered into by an insurer;
“ insured property ” means the property the subject of an
insurance contract made or given by an insurer;
“ insurer ” means any non-resident who undertakes liability
under an insurance contract.
142. —(1.) Where an insured person, whether a resident or non-
resident, has entered into an insurance contract with an insurer,
and the insured property at the time of the making of the contract
is situate in Australia, or the insured event is one which can happen
only in Australia, the premium paid or payable under the contract
shall be included in the assessable income of the insurer, and shall
be deemed to be derived by him from sources in Australia, and,
unless the contract was made by a principal office or branch estab-
lished by the insurer in Australia, this Division shall apply to that
premium. ( A )
(2.) Where an insured person who is a resident has entered into
an insurance contract with an insurer, and an agent or represen-
tative in Australia of the insurer was in any way instrumental in
inducing the entry of the insured person into that contract, any
premium paid or payable under the contract shall, wherever the
insiired property' is situate, or the insured event may happen, be
included in the assessable income of the insurer and shall be deemed
to be derived by him from sources in Australia, and, unless the
contract was made by a principal office or branch established by
the insurer in Australia, this Division shall apply to that premium.

was deemed to be assessable income derived
from sources in Australia by the absentee.
There was a weakness in the section, how-
ever, in that, provided the ab-entee com-
pany is carrying on in Australia an insur-
ance business in a branch office, premiums
received from persons in Australia in
respect of insurance effected abroad with
the head office of the Company, and not
through the local branch, were not assess-
able in Australia.
By effecting insurances directly with a
person in Australia, an absentee com pa m
should not be relieved of liability for taxa

were transacted through its local branch.

(2.) The insurer shall be deemed, in respect of the premiums,
to have derived in any year a taxable income equal to ten per
insurances effected “ with any person in
Australia ”. The section was originally
introduced to tax ex-Australian under-
writers in respect of Australian business
undertaken by them in competition with
companies established in Australia. The
section in the previous Act would have
applied, however, to insurances entered into
by a person in Australia direct with an

which was not in Australia, and which it
was not intended to bring to Australia.

The provisions as now revised apply to—

amount of such premiums:
Provided that, where the actual profit or loss derived or made
by the insurer in respect of such premiums is established to the
satisfaction of the Commissioner, the taxable income of the insurer
in respect thereof, or the amount of the loss so made by him shall,
subject to this Act, be calculated by reference to receipts and
expenditure taken into account in calculating that profit or loss.
144. The insured person and any person in Australia acting on
behalf of the insurer shall be the agents of the insurer, and shall be
jointly and severally liable as such for all purposes of this Act. If
either of those persons pays or credits to the insurer any amount in
respect of the insurance contract before arrangements have been
made to the satisfaction of the Commissioner for the payment of any
income tax which has been or may be assessed under this Division
in respect to that amount, that person shall be personally liable to
pay that tax.
145. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, no such
premium shall be an allowable deduction to the insured person

missioner for the payment of any income tax which has been or may
be assessed in respect of that premium.

Provided that, where the actual profit or loss derived or made by
the insurer in respect of those premiums is established to the satis-
faction of the Commissioner, the taxable income of the insurer
or the amount of the loss so made by him shall, subject to the other
provisions of this Act, be calculated by reference to receipts and
expenditure which were taken into account in calculating that profit
or loss.
(3.) The insured and any person in Australia acting on behalf
of the insurer shall be the agents, and shall be jointly and severally
liable as such, for all purposes of this Act of the insurer, and if either
of those persons pays or credits any amount in respect of that
contract to the insurer before arrangements have been made to the
satisfaction of the Commissioner for the payment of any income tax
which has been or may be assessed under this section in respect of
that amount, the person paying or crediting that amount shall be
personally liable for payment of so much of the income tax, if any,
as is or may become payable by the insurer on ten per centum of that
amount.

“the insurer”) who is not carrying on in Australia an insurance

through any other representative empowered to receive and deal
with premiums under such contracts on behalf of the insurer, that

shall furnish to the Collector of Customs for transmission to the
Commissioner a copy of the Customs entry for such goods and shall

goods as is prescribed.

section (1.) of this section satisfies the Commissioner that, on account
of special circumstances, it is necessary that the rate of tax payable
by him under this section should be ascertained at the time when
premiums are paid to him, the Commissioner mav direct that the tax


financial year shall be calculated at the rate which would have been
payable if an assessment had been made in respect of those
premiums at the date when they were paid.
148. Where a pdrson carrying on the business of insurance
(other than life assurance) in Australia reinsures risks with another
person carrying on a similar business, but not in Australia—
(a) so much of the premiums received on those risks as is
credited or paid to such other person; and
(b) only so much of the losses on those risks as relates to the

13.—(2). In assessments of tax for the financial year beginning
on the first day of July, One thousand nine hundred and twenty-two
and subsequent years, the rate to be applied to the taxable income
of a taxpayer shall be ascertained by calculating the amount of tax
that would, under the Act by which the rates of income tax are
declared, be payable:—(A)
(i) where the taxable income consists wholly of income from
personal exertion —upon a taxable income from personal
exertion equal to the average income, and dividing that
amount of tax by the average income;
(ii) where the taxable income consists wholly of income from
property—upon a taxable income from property equal
to the average income, and dividing that amount of tax
by the average income;
(iii) where the taxable income consists partly of income from
personal exertion and partly of income from property—
upon a taxable income from personal exertion equal to
the average income, and also upon a taxable income
from property equal to the average income, and dividing
these respective amounts of tax by the average income.
The amounts so obtained shall be the rates of tax on
income from personal exertion and income from
property respectively which shall be charged on the
amount of income from personal exertion and the
amount of income from property respectively contained
in the taxable income of the taxpayer:
Provided that this sub-section shall not apply to the taxable
income of a company except income in respect of which it is assessable

(A) This Division temporarily re-enacts i
in toto the previous provisions as regards
the averaging of 5 years’ incomes for the
purpose of ascertaining the appropriate
rate of tax to be applied to the taxable
income. By section 157, however, the
averaging provisions are to terminate
as regards all classes of taxpayers
other than primary producers. This
is in accord with . the recommendation
of the Royal Commission. While the
evidence submitted to the Commission was
generally in favour of the retention of the
averaging provisions for the primary pro-
ducers, the retention was admitted to
be a very doubtful benefit, if not a

any taxpayer means the average of his taxable incomes of the years
(in this section called “ average years ”) beginning with the first
average year and ending with the year next preceding the financial
year for which the tax is payable.
(3.) The first average year shall be the fifth year before the
financial year for which the tax is payable—except in the cases in
which the subsequent provisions of this section provide for the first
average year being a later year.
(4.) The first average year shall not be earlier than the year
beginning on the first day of July One thousand nine hundred and
twenty.

the income of the year which would otherwise be the first average
year was greater than his taxable income of the next succeeding year,
the first average year shall be the first year, subsequent to the first-
mentioned year, in which the taxable income of the taxpayer was less
than his taxable income in the next subsequent year.

counted as an average year, and the provisions of this section shall

Provided that in the case of any loss which is deductible under
sub-section (1.) of section twenty-six of this Act the following
amounts shall not be taken into account under this sub-section in
distinct disadvantage, to other classes of
taxpayers. As, however, the disadvantage
has mostly been suffered by taxpayers
during recent years of depression, it is con-
sidered only equitable to retain the
advantage of the averaging provisions
for all classes of taxpayers during the
recovery period up to and including the
income year ending 30th June, 1937, that
is the year of tax ending 30th June, 1938,
before the recommendation of the Royal
Commission is given effect to.

including a change in the investment of assets from which assessable

income has been permanently reduced to an amount which is less
than two-thirds of his average taxable income, he shall be assessed,
and the provisions of this Division shall apply to the income there-
after derived by him, as if he had never been a taxpayer before that
year.
(2.) For the purposes of this section, “average taxable income”
means the average taxable income by reference to which the tax-
payer’s rate of tax would be calculated apart from the provisions of
this section, if there were excluded from his assessable income of the
average years any income received by him from sources from which
he does not usually receive income.

Assessment Act 1922-1934, sub-section (8)
of section 13, does not contain the negative,
but, in the proviso to that sub-section,
losses -which are deductible under section
26 of that Act are not again taken into
account for the purposes of the averaging
provisions. Thus this proviso in the
1922-1934 Act prevents, in effect, a double
allowance, but the use of the negative in
section 154 of the 1930 Act renders the
retention of the 1922-1934 proviso unneces-
sary.
It is to be noticed, however, that the use
of the negative in section 154 of the 1930
Act does vary the provisions of the pre-
vious Act in respect of deductions of a
concessional nature, such as charitable
gifts, allowances for children, &c.
Under the previous Act deductions of a
concessional nature and the statutory
exemption forming part of the excess of
allowable deductions over the assessable
income were not taken into account in


ascertaining the excess of allowable deductions for the year in which
the loss was incurred—
(а) where the taxpayer did not derive any assessable income
in that year—the amount of the loss which is deductible
under sub-section (1..) of section twenty-six of this Act:
or
(б) where the taxpayer derived assessable income in that
year—the excess of the amount of the loss which is
deductible under sub-section (1.) of section twenty-six
of this Act over the net assessable income as defined in
that section.
(9.) Where a taxpayer establishes that, owing to his retirement
from his occupation, or from any other cause (but not including a
change in the investment of assets from which assessable income was
derived into assets from which the taxpayer derives income which is
not liable to be assessed under this Act), his taxable income has been
permanently reduced to an amount which is less than two-thirds of
his average taxable income, he shall be assessed, and the provisions of
this section shall thereafter apply, as if he had never been a taxpayer
in a previous year.
For the purposes of this sub-section, “ average taxable income ”
means the average taxable income by reference to which the tax-
payer’s rate of tax would be calculated apart from the provisions of
this sub-section, if there were excluded from his assessable income of
the average years any income received by him from sources from
which he does not usually receive income.
arriving at losses to be recouped, but prior
to 1930 were both taken into account in
calculating the average income for rating
purposes. In 1930 the statutory exemption
provision—section 24 of the previous Act
—was amended in order to exclude the
statutory exemption from the excess of
deductions for averaging purposes. The
section as then amended has been repeated
in substance in the 1936 Act in section 81.
In conformity with the principle applied
in 1930 in respect of the statutory exemp-
tion, section 154, in addition to preventing
a double allowance in respect of losses, pro-
vides that no minus quantity in respect of
deductions of a concessional nature shall
be taken into account for the purposes of
the averaging provisions.
(A) This provision was embodied in
section 13 (2) of the previous Act.


(2.) For the purposes of this section, “ primary producer ” means
a person who carries on in Australia a business of primary production.
(3.) For the purpose only of determining whether a person is
carrying on a business of primary production, a beneficiary in a trust
estate shall, to the extent to which he is presently entitled to the
income or part of the income of that estate, be deemed to be carrying
on the business carried on by the trustees of the estate which produces
that income.
(4.) If in respect of any year in which this Division applies
only to taxpayers who are primary producers, a taxpayer who has in
previous years been a primary producer does not carry on business
as a primary producer, the provisions of this Division shall apply to
the income thereafter derived by him as if he had never been a
taxpayer before that year.

not at least two average years, and shall not apply to the taxable

Explanatory Note
Section 159 of the Principal Act provided for a rebate to a non-resident taxpayer,
in respect of income taxed both in the Commonwealth and in the United Kingdom.
It has come under notice that a taxpayer, under the Income Tax laws of the
Commonwealth and the United Kingdom, may be deemed to be a resident of both
countries in respect of the same year; for example, a resident of Australia visiting
England and residing there more than six months. In that event he would have
been liable for income tax on his Australian income both in the Commonwealth and
the United Kingdom.
It is considered that the resident of Australia should be placed in as advantageous
a position as the non-resident in regard to relief from double taxation, and by section
fifteen of the Amending Act the limitation of relief to non-residents has been removed.




shall be entitled to a rebate of tax upon that amount of income at a
rate -which shall be ascertained as follows:
(i) In the case where the amount of income is liable to tax
under this Act and in the United Kingdom, and the
Commonwealth rate is greater than one-half of the
British rate —
(а) where the Commonwealth rate is greater than the
British rate, the rate of rebate shall be one-half
of the British rate;
(б) where the Commonwealth rate is not greater than
the British rate, the rate of rebate shall be the
excess of the Commonwealth rate over one-half
of the British rate:
Provided that no rebate shall be claimable
under this paragraph with respect to any
amount of income to which the next following
paragraph is applicable;
18.—-(1.)
(ii) In the case where the amount of income is liable to tax
under this Act and in a State and in the United King-
dom, and the sum of the Commonwealth and State rates
is greater than one-half of the British rate, the propor-
tion which the Commonwealth rate bears to the sum of
the Commonwealth and State rates shall be ascertained,
and the rate of rebate shall be that proportion of the
following rates; —
(a) Where the sum of the Commonwealth and State
rates is greater than the British rate —one-
half of the British rate;
( b ) Where the sum of the Commonwealth and State
rates is not greater than the British rate—the
excess of the sum of the Commonwealth and
State rates over one-half of the British rate.
(2.) In this section the following expressions, in relation to an
amount of income, have the following meanings:—
(а) “ Commonwealth rate ” means the rate ascertained by
dividing the total amount of income tax paid or payable
for the year by the taxpayer (before the deduction of
rebate granted under this section) by the amount of the
total taxable income in respect of which the tax paid or
payable under this Act has been charged for that year;
except that, where the tax is charged on an amount other
than the ascertained amount of actual profits, the rate of
tax shall be as determined by the Commissioner;
(б) “State rate” has a corresponding meaning in relation to
the income tax paid or payable on the amount of income
under the law of a State; and
(c) “ British rate ” means the appropriate rate of the tax in
the United Kingdom upon the amount of income.


(c) “British rate ” means the rate at which tax is paid under
the law of the United Kingdom on the amount of
income.
(4.) In this section, a reference to a State shall be read as
including a reference to a Territory which is part of the
Commonwealth.
(5.) For the purposes of this section, a certificate issued by or on
behalf of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue in the United King-
dom shall be receivable in evidence to show—
(a) what is the rate at which tax has been paid under the law
of the United Kingdom; and
(b) the particular amount of income which is liable to tax
under this Act on which tax has been paid under the
law of the United Kingdom.
160. —(1.) Where the taxable income of an individual includes
income derived by him from a business carried on by him either alone
or as a partner with any other person, and the rate of tax payable
by him upon his income from personal exertion exceeds the rate of
tax payable by companies for the year of tax, a rebate of tax shall
be allowed in his assessment of the amount arrived at by applying
a rate equal to the difference between those rates of tax to fifteen
per centum of the income so included in his taxable income.( A )
(2.) In this section, “ business ” means a business which from
its nature and character requires the retention in the business of
not less than fifteen per centum of the taxable income of each year.
(3.) This section shall not apply in any case by reason only of
the existence of any one or more of the following facts: —
(a) The amount set aside, appropriated or written off the value
of assets in the accounts of an individual in respect of
depreciation, exceeds the amount, if any, allowable under
this Act in respect of depreciation of those assets.
Rebata lo

income.
(A) Section 30 of the previous Act has
been redrafted to express its original inten-
tion, which had to be departed from in
certain directions as the result of the
judgment of the late Sir Leo Cussen of the
Victorian Supreme Court in the case of
Kiddle v. Commissioner of Taxation,
(1932) 2 A.T.D. 185.
One effect of the judgment was that the
word “ income ” appearing in sub-section
(2) of the previous section had no relation
to assessable or taxable income as ascer-
tained in accordance with the Act, but
meant income in the ordinary accountancy
sense. The position that resulted was that
a person could claim the benefit of the sec-
tion if it w-as necessary for him to retain
in the business some part of his “ income ”
in the ordinary sense of the word, even if
the part of that income which he had to
retain was not part of his taxable income,
and was therefore not subject to tax.
To overcome this, sub-section (2) now
requires the retention of not less than
fifteen per centum of the taxable income.
A further effect of the judgment was that
in ascertaining the amount of the rebate,
the rate of tax payable by the person in
respect of the business income should be
regarded as the rate of tax which would
be payable on that income by the person
if it w r ere his only income.
The rate of tax thus ascertained was
always less than the actual rate payable if
the person concerned had other income, and
the effect of the judgment in this respect
was that the rebate allowable was less
than was intended. Sub-section (1) has,
therefore, been redrafted to ensure that the
rebate shall be calculated with regard to
the full excess of the actual rate over the
rate payable by companies.


(2a.) In this section, a reference to a State shall be read as includ-
ing a reference to a Territory which is part of the Commonwealth.
(3.) For the purposes of this section a certificate issued by or on
behalf of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue in the United
Kingdom shall be receivable in evidence to show—
(o) what is the appropriate rate of United Kingdom tax, and
( b ) the particular amount of income which is liable to tax
under this Act and in the United Kingdom.
30.—(1.) Where an individual derives income from a business
carried on by himself or in partnership with other persons, and his
rate of tax on that income exceeds the rate imposed on the taxable
income of a company, he shall be entitled to a rebate in his assessment
of a sum equal to the amount by which his tax on fifteen per centum
of that income exceeds the tax that would be payable on that percen-
tage of that income, at the rate imposed on the taxable income of a
company.
(2.) In this section “business” means a business which from its
nature and character requires for its efficient working the retention in
the business of some part of the income of each year.
Rebate In

business Income.
A new sub-section (3) has been inserted
to clarify the intention of the section.
The original object of the provision, which
was incorporated in the law by the Income
Tax Assessment Act 1922, was to grant the
concession provided by the section to a very
limited class of business, which, being fully
capitalized, was bound to appropriate part
of its taxable income for the purpose of
preserving its assets at their original
value.
The provision was never intended to
grant the concession, at the expense of
other taxpayers, to a person entering upon
a business with the use of borrowed money
and retaining his taxable income in order
to pay off his indebtedness, and so build up
his capital. But a recent decision of the
Board of Review (would extend the benefits
of the section to such a case.
Hitherto, the section has been applied
almost exclusively to pastoral propositions,
where natural increase of live stock must
be retained to replace worthless animals,
and so enable the assets of the business to
be maintained at their effective strength.
The section as amended will not have the
effect of depriving primary producers of the
benefit of the section in those types of cases
where the section was previously being
applied.
Under paragraph (a) of sub-section (3),
retention of proceeds of a business under
the heading of depreciation shall not be a
cause for the application of the section to
a case, because the law already provides
for complete exemption by way of deduc-
tion in each assessment of the part of the
taxpayer's gross receipts that represents
the permissible provision for depreciation
of plant and machinery. No further con-
cession, by way of reduction in the rate of
tax on any part of the taxable income, could
be justified or permitted in such a case.


( b) It is necessary to retain taxable income to meet expenditure
of such a nature as would be, if and when incurred, a
deduction under this Act from assessable income.
(c) It is necessary to retain taxable income to repay borrowed
money.
(d) It is necessary to retain taxable income to increase capital.

scribed form to be endorsed on or annexed to the return setting
out such information as to the sources available for the compilation of
the return as is prescribed. ( A )
(2.) Every person carrying on business who does not furnish with
his return an agent’s certificate shall furnish particulars in the
prescribed form, endorsed on or annexed to the return, setting out
such information as to the sources available for the compilation of
the return as is prescribed. ( B )
166. From the returns, and from any other information in his
possession, or from any one or more of these sources, the Commis-
sioner shall make an assessment of the amount of the taxable income
of any taxpayer, and of the tax payable thereon.
167. If—
(a) any person makes default in furnishing a return; or
( b ) the Commissioner is not satisfied with the return
furnished by any person; or
(c) the Commissioner has reason to believe that any person
who has not furnished a return has derived taxable
income,
the Commissioner may make an assessment of the amount upon
which in his judgment income tax ought to be levied, and that
amount shall be the taxable income of that person for the purpose
of the last preceding section.
168. (1.) The Commissioner may at any time during any year,
or after its expiration, make an assessment of the taxable income
derived in that year or any part of it by any taxpayer, and of the
tax payable thereon. (°)
(2.) Where the income, in respect of which such an assessment
is made, is derived in a period less than a year, the assessment shall
be made as if the beginning and end of that period were the
beginning and end respectively of the year of income.
169. Where under this Act any person is liable to pay tax, the
Commissioner may make an assessment of the amount of such tax.( D )

(A) The Koval Commission recommended
that provision should be made for the
registration of tax agents, and that regis-
tration should be effected either by the
Commonwealth or by the States. As it
would be more convenient to have the
supervision of tax agents undertaken in
the States, and as some of the States
already provide for registration and other
States propose to make similar provision,
Commonwealth action is not necessary.
Experience has shown, however, the need
to provide in the Act for agents to furnish
a certificate setting out information (see
regulation 33) as to the sources available
for the compilation of the return. Such
a provision will tend to greater accuracy,
nnd greater care being exercised in the
furnishing of returns. A penalty is pro-
vided under section 228 for failure to sign
the certificate, or for furnishing a false
certificate.


35. From the returns and from any other information in his
possession, or from any one or more of these sources, the Commis-
sioner shall cause assessments to be made for the purpose of
ascertaining the taxable income upon which income tax shall be
levied.
36. If—
(а) any person makes default in furnishing any return; or
(б) the Commissioner is not satisfied with the return made by
any person; or
(c) the Commissioner has reason to believe that any person
(though he may not have furnished any return) is a
taxpayer,
the Commissioner may cause an assessment to be made of the amount
upon which, in his judgment, income tax ought to be levied, and the
person assessed shall be liable to income tax thereon, excepting, so
far as he establishes on objection that the assessment is excessive.

(B) In the case of persons in business
who do not employ a taxation agent, sub-
section (2) requires particulars to be fur-
nished of the sources available for the
compilation "of the return.
(C) This section sets out in a separate
provision the substance of that portion
of sub-section (2) of Section 33 of the
previous Act which refers to the making
of special assessments.
Sub-section (2) permits of trading
stock on hand being brought to account in
an assessment for a period of less than
a year, in the same manner as it would bo
brought to account if the period were a
full year.
(D) This is a drafting provision inserted
to obviate repeated specific reference to the
power of the Commissioner to make an
assessment wherever throughout the Act,
a person is made liable to pay tax.


170.— (1.) The Commissioner may, subject to this section, at any
time amend any assessment by making such alterations therein or
additions thereto as he thinks necessary, notwithstanding that tax
may have been paid in respect of the assessment. ( A )
(2.) Where a taxpayer has not made to the Commissioner a
full and true disclosure of all the material facts necessary for his
assessment, and the Commissioner is of opinion that there has been
an avoidance of tax, the Commissioner may—
(а) where he is of opinion that the avoidance of tax is due to
fraud or evasion—at any time; and
(б) in any other case —within six years from the date upon
which the tax became due and payable under the
assessment,
amend the assessment by making such alterations therein or additions
thereto as he thinks necessary to correct an error in calculation or a
mistake of fact or to prevent avoidance of tax as the case may be.
(3.) Where a taxpayer has made to the Commissioner a full and
true disclosure of all the material facts necessary for his assess-
ment, and an assessment is made after that disclosure, no amend-
ment of the assessment increasing the liability of the taxpayer in
any particular shall be made except to correct an error in calcula-
tion or a mistake of fact; and no such amendment shall be made
after the expiration of three years from the date upon which the
tax became due and payable under that assessment.
(4.) No amendment effecting a reduction in the liability of a
taxpayer under an assessment shall be made except to correct an
error in calculation or a mistake of fact; and no such amendment
shall be made after the expiration of three years from the date
upon which the tax became due and payable under that assessment.
(5.) Where an assessment has, under this section, been amended
in any particular, the Commissioner may, within three years from
the date upon which the tax became due under the amended assess-
ment make, in or in respect of that particular, such further amend-
ment in the assessment as, in his opinion, is necessary to effect such
reduction in the liability of the taxpayer under the assessment aa
is just.
(6.) Where an application for an amendment in his assessment
is made by a taxpayer within three years from the date upon which
the tax became due and payable under that assessment, and the
taxpayer has supplied to the Commissioner within that period all
information needed by the Commissioner for the purpose of decid-
ing the application, the Commissioner may amend "the assessment
when he decides that application notwithstanding that that period
has elapsed.
Amendment of
Aiieiameot*.
(A) One of the chief criticisms in the
past in respect of amended assessments has
related to amendments due to an altera-
tion in the interpretation of the law. The
1930 Act provides that no assessments shall
be re-opened on a point of law (except, of
course, as the result of the determina-
tion of an objection lodged by the tax-
payer). Under sub-scetiona (2), (3) and
(4), no amendment shall be made except
to correct an error in calculation or a mis-
take of fact, or, in cases where there has
betij a non-disclosure of information result-
ing in an avoidance of tax, to prevent such
avoidance.


SECTION 16.—AMENDMENT OF ASSESSMENTS.
170.—(1.) The Commissioner may, subject to this section, at any time amend
any assessment by making such alterations therein or additions thereto as he thinks
necessary, notwithstanding that tax may have been paid in respect of the
assessment.
(2.) "Where a taxpayer has not made to the Commissioner a full and true
disclosure of all the material facts necessary for his assessment, and the Commissioner
is of opinion that there has been an avoidance of tax, the Commissioner may—
(а) where he is of opinion that the avoidance of tax is due to fraud or
evasion—at any time; and
(б) in any other case—within six years from the date upon which the tax
became due and payable under the assessment,
amend the assessment by making such alterations therein or additions thereto, as
he thinks necessary to correct an error in calculation or a mistake of fact or to prevent
avoidance of tax as the case may be.
Explanatory Note:—
This is a drafting amendment to delete the first of the two references to the
opinion of the Commissioner.




37.—(1.) The Commissioner may, subject to this section, cause
to be made all such alterations in or additions to any assessment as
he thinks necessary in order to insure its completeness and accuracy,
notwithstanding that income tax may have been paid in respect of
income included in the assessment:
(la.) An alteration in or addition’to an assessment may be made
under this section—
(a) where the Commissioner is of opinion that there has been
an avoidance of tax and that the avoidance is due to
fraud or evasion—at any time;
( b ) where the Commissioner is of opinion that there has been
an avoidance of tax in the assessment owing to the
failure or omission of the taxpayer to keep books,
accounts or records from which the income of the tax-
payer might reasonably be ascertained, and that the
avoidance is not due to fraud or evasion—within six
years from the date when the tax payable on the
assessment was originally due and payable;
(c) in any other case —within three years from the date when
the tax payable on the assessment was originally due
and payable:
Provided that where as the result of an alteration or addition to
au assessment any fresh liability is, or has been, imposed on the
taxpayer a further alteration or addition may be made within three
years from the date upon which the tax became due and payable
under the amended assessment, but only for the purpose of adjusting
that liability by way of reduction.
(ba) where an application for an alteration in his assessment
is made by the taxpayer within three years from the
date when the + x payable on the assessment was
originally due .d payable, and the taxpayer has
supplied to the Commissioner, within that period, all
information needed by the Commissioner for the pur-
pose of deciding the application—at any time; and
Alteration of
asaesament.
The introduction of the test of non-
disclosure of information makes unneces-
sary the test of failure to keep proper
accounts, as set out in section 37 (1a) (6)
of the previous Act. For practical pur-
poses, the Taxation Department is largely
in the hands of the taxpayer, who is the
person, and the only person, in the position
to submit the full facts in order to permit
of an accurate assessment being made.
Full disclosure of the facts will materially
assist the Department in reaching finality
in its assessments, and under sub-section
(3), where such disclosure has been made,
the assessment is definitely closed after the
exniration of three years.


(7.) Nothing contained in this section shall prevent the amend-
ment of any assessment in order to give effect to the decision upon
any appeal or review, or its amendment by way of reduction in any
particular in pursuance of an objection made by the taxpayer or
pending any appeal or review.
(8.) Where—
(a) any provision of this Act is expressly made to depend
in any particular upon a determination, opinion or
judgment of the Commissioner; and
(&) any assessment is affected in any particular by that
determination, opinion or judgment, ■
then if, after the making of the assessment it appears to the Com-
missioner that the determination, opinion or judgment was
erroneous, he may correct it and amend the assessment accordingly
in the same circumstances as he could under this section amend an
assessment by reason of a mistake of fact.f-*-)
(9.) Notwithstanding anything contained in this section, when
the assessment of the taxable income of any year includes an
estimated amount of income derived by the taxpayer in that year
from an operation or series of operations the profit or loss on which
was not ascertainable at the end of that year owing to the fact
that the operation or series of operations extended over more than
one or parts of more than one year, the Commissioner may at any
time within three years after ascertaining the total profit or loss
actually derived or arising from the operation or series of opera-
tions, amend the assessment so as to ensure its completeness and
accuracy on the basis of the profit or loss so ascertained.
171. —(1.) Where a taxpayer has duly furnished to the Com-
missioner a return of income, and no notice of assessment in respect
thereof has been served within twelve months thereafter, he may
in writing by registered post request the Commissioner to make an
assessment. ( B )
(2.) If within three months after the receipt by the Commis-
sioner of the request a notice of assessment is not served upon the
taxpayer, any assessment issued thereafter in respect of that income
shall be deemed to be an amended assessment, and for the purpose
of determining whether such amended assessment may be made, the
taxpayer shall be deemed to have been served on the last day of
the three months with a notice of assessment in respect of which
income tax was payable on that day.
172. Where by reason of any amendment the taxpayer’s liability
is reduced, the Commissioner shall refund any tax overpaid.
Where no
notice of
assessment
served.
Refund of t&z
overpaid.
(A) There was no express power under
the previous Act for the Commissioner to
alter or vary a determination once made,
and acted upon, such as, for example, the
amount of depreciation allowable as a
deduction. Sub-section (8) will provide for
an assessment which is based on a deter-
mination of the Commissioner being
amended in the same circumstances as an
assessment may be amended by reason of a
mistake of fact.
(B) In practice, the Department concen-
trates on the examination and assessment of
returns which disclose a taxable income.


37. (3.) Notwithstanding anything contained in this section,
where an assessment for any financial year includes the estimated
amount of taxable income derived by the taxpayer, during the pre-
ceding financial year, from an operation or series of operations the
profit or loss on which was not ascertainable at the end of that
preceding year owing to the fact that the operation or series of
operations was carried on during a period which extends over more
than one, or parts of more than one, financial year, the Commissioner,
upon ascertaining the total profit or loss actually derived or arising
from the operation or series of operations, may, at any time, cause
that assessment to be altered so as to ensure its completeness and
accuracy on the basis of the profit or loss so ascertained.
37. —(2.) When any alteration in an assessment has the effect of
reducing the taxpayer’s liability the Commissioner may refund the
taxpayer any tax overpaid.
and the revision of non-taxable returns is,
in many cases, deferred. As a result,
assessments are at times issued in respect
of these returns at a much later date.
The final examination of all non-taxable
returns concurrently with taxable returns
would result in a considerable increase in
departmental expenditure. Section 171
will, however, cover special cases, and will
permit of the fixing of a time limit for
the issue of any assessment after the
date of the taxpayer’s request.

document. ( B )
177. (1.) The production of a notice of assessment, or of a

sioner, or a Deputy Commissioner, purporting to be a copy of a

of the assessment and (except in proceedings on appeal against
the assessment) that the amount and all the particulars of the,
assessment are correct.
(2.) The production of a Gazette containing a notice purporting
to be issued by the Commissioner shall be conclusive evidence that
the notice was so issued.
(3.) The production of a document under the hand of the Com-

porting to be a copy of a document issued by either the Commissioner,
Second Commissioner, or a Deputy Commissioner, shall be conclusive
evidence that the document was so issued.
(4.) The production of a document under the hand of the Com-
missioner, Second Commissioner, or a Deputy Commissioner, pur-

removed The period of 60 days has been
uniformly adopted for this and associated
sections so as to do away with the con-
fusion caused by the varying periods for
different purposes.
(B) The deposit for an appeal or refer-
ence to the Board of Review has been fixed
at £l. There was under the previous
Act no deposit demanded for an
appeal to a Court, but in the case
of a reference to the Board of Review’,
the Regulations prescribed a minimum
of fl and a maximum of £5O, the
calculation being based upon 1 per cent, of
the amount in dispute, according to the
circumstances of the type of case involved.
It is considered that the simple prescrip-
tion in the Act itself for a fixed deposit of
£1 will be sufficient to prevent frivolous
or unreasonable appeals or references, and
save the Department from the work of pre-
paring and transmitting unnecessary cases
The matter of refunding or retaining the
deposit is made automatic, being dependent
upon a reduction being secured ’n *he


(2.) The Commissioner shall consider the objection, and may
either disallow it, or allow it, either wholly or in part.
(3.) The Commissioner shall give to the objector written notice
of his decision on the objection.
(4.) A'taxpayer who is dissatisfied with the decision of the Com-
missioner, Assistant Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner may
within thirty days after the service by post of notice of that
decision—
(o) in writing, request the Commissioner to refer the decision
to a Board of Review for review; or
(6) in writing, request the Commissioner to treat his objection
as an appeal and to forward it either to the High Court
or to the Supreme Court of a State.
(5.) The Commissioner may in any case in his discretion and
upon reasonable cause being shown by the taxpayer, extend for a
further period not exceeding thirty days (a) the period of forty-two
days mentioned in sub-section (1.) of this section and (6) the period
of thirty days mentioned in sub-section (4.) of this section.
51.— (1.) Where a taxpayer has, in accordance with the last
preceding section, requested the Commissioner to refer a decision
to a Board of Review, the Commissioner shall, if the taxpayer’s
request is accompanied by a deposit of such amount as is prescribed
for the particular class of case, refer the decision to the Board not
later than thirty days after receipt of the request.

or unreasonable, order the forfeiture of the whole or part of the

assessment.
(C) This section gives further time to
the Commissioner for forwarding references
to the Board of Review. There was no time
limit fixed by the previous Act for forward-
ing an appeal to a Court, but 30 days was
fixed for a reference to the Board of
Review. In practice'the time limit of 30
days was found quite inadequate, since the
Deputy Commissioner in a State was re-
quired to prepare and forward the case to
the Commissioner in Canberra for transmis-
sion to the Board. The 30 days did not give
the Commissioner time for any reference
back to the Deputy Commisisoner or to the
taxpayer for examination of any fresh
aspect or the collation of further informa-
tion. Such action is frequently necessary
in the interests of the taxpayer as well as
of the Department. If, within GO days, the
case has not been transmitted and if the
taxpayer feels prejudiced by the delay,
the section provides for 60 days’ notice to
be given for the transmission of the objec-
tion. Before the Commissioner can be com-
pelled to comply with this demand, how-
ever, the taxpayer on his part must furnish
all information required for the purpose
of clarifying the issues before the Court
or the Board.


Grounds ol
objection and
burden of proof.
190. Upon every such reference or appeal—
(a) the taxpayer shall be limited to the ground stated in
his objection; and
( i) the burden of proving that the assessment is excessive
shall lie upon the taxpayer.(A)
191. If the assessment has been reduced by the Commissioner
after considering the objection, the reduced assessment shall be
the assessment to be dealt with on the reference or appeal.
192. A Board of Review shall have power to review such
decisions of the Commissioner, Second Commissioner or a Deputy
Commissioner as are referred to it under this Act.
193. (1.) For the purposes of reviewing such decisions, the
Board shall, subject to this section, have all the powers and functions
of the Commissioner in making assessments, determinations and
decisions under this Act,(B) and such assessments, determinations and
decisions of the Board, and its decisions upon review, shall for all
purposes (except for the purpose of objections thereto and review
thereof and appeals therefrom) be deemed to be assessments, deter-
minations or decisions of the Commissioner.
(2.) The Board shall not have power to review decisions of the
Commissioner relating to the remission of additional tax except
decisions relating to the remission of additional tax imposed by
section two hundred and twenty-six of this Act where the addi-
tional tax payable, after the making by the Commissioner of his
decision, exceeds—
(а) in any ease to which sub-section (1.) of that section
applies—the greater of the following amounts, namely,
the sum of One pound or an amount calculated, in
respect of the period commencing on the last day
allowed for furnishing the return or information and

tion is furnished or the day upon which the assessment
is made whichever first happens, at the rate of ten per
centum per annum of the tax assessable to the taxpayer;

Powers of
Board.
(A) This sub-scr.tion repeats, in effect,
though in more direct words, the pro-
vision in section 39 (1) (6) of the previous
Act-see page 179 —that, on appeal, the
assessment shall be prima facie evidence ol
its correctness.
(B) The High Court hold in the ease of
Jolly v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation,
(1935) 53 C.L.R. 200, that the Board of
Review had power to review the discretion
of the Commissioner in regard to the remis-
sion of penalties. Prior to that judgment,
both the Commissioner and the Board had
considered that the Act did not permit such
review by the Board.


51.—(2.) A taxpayer shall be limited on the review to the
grounds stated in his objection.
51a. —(3.) A taxpayer shall be limited, on the hearing of the
appeal, to the grounds stated in his objection. _
51. —(3.) If the assessment has been reduced by the Commis-
sioner after considering the objection, the reduced assessment shall
be the assessment to be dealt with by the Board under the next
succeeding sub-section.
51a. —(4.) If the assessment has been reduced by the Commis-
sioner after considering the objection, the reduced assessment shall
be the assessment appealed from.
44.— (1.) A Board of Review shall have power to review such ;
decisions of the Commissioner, Assistant Commissioner or Deputy
Commissioner as are referred to it by the Commissioner under this
Act and, for the purpose of reviewing such decisions, shall have all
the powers and functions of the Commissioner in making assessments,
determinations and decisions under this Act, and such assessments,
determinations and decisions of the Board, and the decisions of the
Board upon review, shall, for all purposes (except for the purposes
of sub-section (4.) of section fifty and sub-section (6.) of section
fifty-one of this Act) be deemed to be assessments, determinations or
decisions of the Commissioner.
(2.) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, a deter-
mination made by the Board under section twenty-one of this Act
shall not be invalidated by reason of the fact that it is not made
within the time prescribed by that section.
Power* of
Board.
To permit the right of review in regard
to the many minor cases of penalties that
are dealt with as a matter of administra-
tion under the Act would be to overload
the work of the Board and cause unneces-
sary congestion of work for the Department
as well as the Board.
However, in regard to the more serious
3924.-7
penalties that are generally imposed for
omissions of income, the Government
decided to permit of the review by the
Board cf-the discretion of the Commissioner
in all cases where the penalty remaining,
after the exercise by the Commissioner of
his discretion, exceeds ten per centum per
annum of the tax involved.


respect of the period commencing on the last day allowed
for furnishing the return and ending on the day upon
which the assessment in respect of the omitted income or
excessive deduction is made, at the rate of ten per
centum per annum of the difference between the tax
properly payable by the taxpayer and the tax that would
be payable if it were assessed upon the basis of the
return furnished by him.

for the opinion of the High Court upon any question of law arising
on the appeal.

remit the case with its opinion to the Court below, and may make
such order as to the costs of the case stated as it thinks fit.

Explanatory Note: —
Section 218 of the Principal Act repeated the provisions of section 65 of the
1922-1934 Assessment Act. It was found, however, that the section did not’ give
full power to the Commissioner to accept or require payment of tax by instalments.
As this method of payment of tax is, in some cases, to the advantage both of the
taxpayer and the Taxation Department, provision has been made by section 17
of the Amending Act empowering the Commissioner to collect tax by instalments
from a person owing money to the taxpayer.

(A) Difficulty lias been experienced in
the past in issuing assessments and collect-
ing the tax on royalties rcceir-ed by non-
residents from persons in Australia. Large
sums are paid to non-residents in respect
of royalties on copyrights, machinery, &c.,
used by taxpayers in Australia in the pro-
duction of their income. These royalties
form part of the manufacturing expenses of
the taxpayer using that machinery, &c.,
and are frequently not shown separately
in the accounts submitted to the Depart-
ment. Section 250 will ensure that par-
ticulars of royalties payable to non-resi

proportion to the tax as the share of the taxable income
of such other person bears to the whole of the taxable
income ;

tax under this section may sue therefor in any court of
competent jurisdiction as money paid to the use of the

As to the liability to tax of the non-
resident in respect of such royalties, the
law is not altered, and, as in the past, will
be determined under the general law on the
subject.
(B) Section 92 of the previous Act has

the thirteenth day of September, One thousand nine hun-
dred and fifteen —shall not be valid to impose on the
mortgagor the obligation of paying income tax to any
greater amount than the amount (if any) which would
have been payable by the mortgagor if his taxable
income consisted solely of a sum equivalent to the
amount of interest to be paid under the mortgage with-
out taking into account any income tax payable on that
interest; and
(б) if the mortgage was entered into after that date —shall be
absolutely void.
(2.) A covenant or stipulation in a mortgage, whether entered
into before or after the commencement of this sub-section, which
has or purports to have the purpose or effect of including in or adding
to the interest payable, in any specified circumstances, by the
mortgagor, any amount in respect of income tax payable by the
mortgagee upon the interest to be paid under the mortgage, shall be
void to the extent only to which it has or purports to have that
purpose or effect.
(3.) Where, in any mortgage, provision is made for the reduction
of the rate or amount of interest in the event of prompt payment of
the interest or in any other circumstances, and for the rate or amount
of such reduction to be diminished by or in proportion to any amount
of income tax payable by the mortgagee the portion of the provision
which provides for that diminution shall be void, and the reduction
of the rate or amount of interest shall take effect as if the portion
of the provision which provides for that diminution had not been
inserted.
Covenant by
mortgagor
to pay tax.
(A) The words “ as against the Coinmis-
gioner, or in regard to any proceeding under
this Act” have been inserted in the section.
The absence of this limitation in the pre-
vious Act made the section operate in a
manner which was not intended. By way of
illustration, the case of de Romero v. The
Executors of Hordern’s Estate, decided by
the High Court in 1932, 48 C.L.R. C 49,
may be quoted. The testator had covenanted
in a separation deed to pay his wife the

or purports to have the purpose or effect of imposing on the mortgagor
the obligation of paying income tax on the interest to be paid under
the mortgage—
(a) if the mortgage was entered into on or before the thirteenth
day of September One thousand nine hundred and fif-
teen —shall not be valid to impose on the mortgagor the
obligation of paying income tax to any greater amount
than the amount (if any) which would have been
payable by the mortgagor if his taxable income consisted
solely of a sum equivalent to the amount of interest to be
paid under the mortgage without taking into account
any income tax payable on that interest; and
(b) if the mortgage was entered into after that date—shall be
absolutely void.
(2.) A covenant or stipulation in a mortgage, whether entered
into before or after the commencement of this sub-section, which has
or purports to have the purpose or effect of including in or adding to
the interest payable, in any specified circumstances, by the mortgagor,

the interest to be paid under the mortgage, shall be void to the
extent only to which it has or purports to have that purpose or effect.

of the rate or amount of interest in the event of prompt payment
of the interest or in any other circumstances, and for the rate or
amount of such reduction to be diminished by or in proportion to any
amount of income tax payable by the mortgagee, the portion of the
provision which provides for that diminution shall be void, and the
reduction of the rate or amount of interest shall take effect as if the
portion of the provision which provides for that diminution had not

Covenant by
mortgagor
to pay tax.
State income tax, and to refund and repay
to her any such tax which she might pay
in respect of such annuity. An action
brought by her against his executors to
recover an amount of tax paid by her was
dismissed on the ground that the covenant
was one to alter the incidence of the tax,
and was therefore void,
Under the amendment contracts between
parties for one or the other to carry the
tax will be void only so far as the taxation
authorities are concerned.


(4.) Any provision in a mortgage by or under which it is pro-
vided that any income tax payable by the mortgagee, or any portion
thereof, shall or may be taken into account for the purpose of fixing,
measuring, or calculating the rate of interest payable under the

extent to which it provides for income tax to be so taken into account
(but not otherwise), be void, whether the provision be in the form
of a covenant or agreement to pay interest, or a proviso or a stipula-
tion for an alternative, substituted, or reduced rate of interest in lieu
of a higher rate payable by the mortgagor pursuant to any such
covenant or agreement, or otherwise.
(5.) For the purposes of this section, “mortgage” includes any
charge, lien or encumbrance to secure the repayment of money, and
any collateral or supplementary agreement, whether in writing or
otherwise, and whether or not it be one whereby the terms of any
mortgage are varied or supplemented, or the due date for the pay-
ment of money secured by mortgage is altered, or an extension of
time for payment is granted.(A)

SUPPLEMENT TO EXPLANATORY HAND-
BOOK ON THE INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT
ACT 1936.
This Supplement is explanatory of the amendments made to
the Principal Act by the Income Tax Assessment Act (No. 2)
1936.
(Issued under the Authority of the Commonwealth Treasurer,
Hon. R. G. Casey. M.P.)
Dated the 31st DECEMBER, 1936.
By Authority:
L. F. Johnston, Commonwealth Government Printer, Canberra.


PREFACE.
The most important subject covered by the amendments made to the Principal
Act by the Income Tax Assessment Act {No. 2) 1936 is that of Crown leases of land
used for primary production.
During the passage of the Principal Act through Parliament in May of this
year, the Treasurer undertook to refer this subject to Sir David Ferguson, Chairman
of the Royal Commission on Taxation, for further inquiry and report.
Sir David Ferguson duly submitted his report to the Treasurer and the
recommendations made and conclusions reached by him as the result of his inquiry
have been embodied in the Act.
The opportunity was also taken to make other minor amendments to the
Principal Act which were considered to be either necessary or desirable.
To the extent to which the provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act {No. 2)
1936 affect the States as well as the Commonwealth, they represent provisions which,
in the interests of uniformity, the States have been asked to adopt as far as the
framework of their Acts necessitates.
R. EWING,
Commissioner of Taxation.

INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT ACT
(NO. 2) 1936.
No. 88 of 1936.
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM SHOWING THE AMENDMENTS
MADE TO THE INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT ACT 1936, BY
THE INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT ACT (No. 2) 1936.
The words printed in italics are words omitted from the Principal Act.
The words printed in black type are words inserted in the Principal Act.
SECTION I.—SHOET TITLE AND CITATION.
1. This Act may be cited as the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936.
This Act may be cited as the Income Tax Assessment Acts 1936.
SECTION 2.—DEFINITIONS.
6. In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears
*****
“ special property tax ” means the further income tax, if any, imposed as a
percentage of that part of the taxable income of any person which is
attributable to income derived by him
(o) from property;
(b) by way of interest, dividends, rents or royalties, whether derived
from personal exertion or from property; and
(c) in the course of carrying on a business, if the income is of such a
class that, when it is derived otherwise than in the course of
carrying on a business, it is income from property ;
Explanatory Note:—
Consequent upon the Government’s decision to remove the special property
tax, the references in the Principal Act to that tax have been deleted. Other
references to the special property tax appear in sections 46, 81 and 253 of the
Principal Act.
SECTION 3.—EXEMPTIONS.
23. The following income shall be exempt from income tax :
* * * *
( s) the income of —
(i) any fund or association maintained by a religious institution ; or
(ii) any company the whole of the shares of which are held by or on
behalf of a religious institution,
where the fund or association is maintained, or the company was formed
and is carried on, for the sole purpose of insuring property belonging to
the religious institution, and where the profits arising from the fund,
or derived by the association or company, are devoted to that sole purpose
or to the purposes of the religious institution.


Explanatory Note:—
Section 23 (s) of the Principal Act provided for the exemption of the income of a
company which was formed and carried on for the sole purpose of insuring property
belonging to a religious institution.
As drafted the exemption would not apply if a company, although not formed
for the purpose mentioned, had in fact carried on business in accordance with the
conditions therein set out. Section 3of the Amending Act deletes paragraph («)
of section 23, leaving the exemption to be determined in accordance with the usual
practice of the Taxation Department that where the income belongs in effect to a
religious institution the exemption will be granted under section 23 (e).
SECTION 4.—DISPOSAL OF ASSETS OF A BUSINESS.
36. —(1.) Subject to this section, where the whole or any part of the assets of a
business carried on by a taxpayer is disposed of by sale or otherwise howsoever,
whether for the purpose of putting an end to the business or any part thereof or not,
and the assets disposed of include any property being trading stock, standing or
growing crops or crop-stools, the value of that property shall be included in his
assessable income, and any person acquiring that property shall be deemed to have
purchased it at the amount of that value.
(2.) Where a taxpayer, after the beginning of the first year to the assessment
of the income of which this Act applies sells the whole of a business carried on by
him—
(o) for the purpose of putting an end to that business; or
(6) in consequence of the acquisition or resumption of land, used by him for
that business, under the provisions of any Act or State Act which
contains provisions for the compulsory acquisition or resumption
of land,
the value of any live stock included in the sale being natural increase bred by him
which was on hand at the beginning of that first year, and which was, in the opinion
of the Commissioner, ordinarily used by him in that business for breeding purposes,
shall not be included in his assessable income, and no deduction shall be allowed to
him in respect of any such live stock, and no such live stock shall be. taken into
account in computing his taxable income.
(3.) For the purposes of this section, the value of any property or live stock
shall be—
(a) the price specified in any contract of sale or arrangement as the price at
which it was disposed of; or
{b) if a price is not so specified in any such contract or arrangement —
(i) the market value of the property or live stock on the day of
the disposal; or
(ii) if in the opinion of the Commissioner there is insufficient
evidence of the market value on that day—the value which
in his opinion is fair and reasonable.
Explanatory Note:—
This amendment gives effect to the adoption of a recommendation by Sir David
Ferguson, Chairman of the Royal Commission on Taxation.
The amendment made to the lease provisions to exclude wholly or partly from
assessable income the consideration received for the sale or surrender of leases of
Crown land would, if the amendment to section 36 (3.) had not been made, provide
a means for the evasion of tax.


Section 36 (3.) as it stood, without the amendment, bound'the Commissioner
on a walk-in walk-out sale to the allocation by the parties of the purchase
money. As the consideration for the lease will be either wholly or partly
non-assessable income, there would be a strong temptation to allocate in the contract
a high price for the lease, thereby reducing the assessable proceeds from the sale
of live-stock. The amendment to section 36 (3.) obviates this risk of loss of revenue.
SECTION S.—DEVOLUTION ON DEATH.
37.—(1.) Where the assets of a business carried on by a taxpayer devolve by
reason of his death, and those assets include any property being trading stock,
standing or growing crops, or crop-stools, the value of that property shall, subject
to this Act, be included in the assessable income derived by the deceased up to the
date of his death, and the person upon whom the property devolves shall be deemed
to have purchased it at that value.
(2.) For the purpose of the last preceding sub-section, the value of the property
so to be included shall be the amount which would have been included in respect
of that property in the assessable income of the deceased person, under the last
preceding section, if he had not died but had disposed of the property on the day of
his death for the purpose of putting an end to the whole of a business carried on by
him and ivithout any price being specified in any contract or arrangement:
Explanatory Note:—
This amendment is consequential upon that made to section 36 (3.) above.
SECTION 6.—REBATE ON DIVIDENDS.
46.—(1.) Subject to this section; a shareholder shall be entitled to a rebate
•in his assessment of the amount obtained by applying to that part of the dividends
which is included in his taxable income a rate equivalent to—
(o) the rate of tax payable by him on income from property ; or
(6) the rate of tax payable by companies for the year of-tax,
whichever is the less.
(2.) In determining the rate of rebate any special property tax shall not be taken into
account.
Explanatory Note:—
This amendment removes one of the special property tax provisions from
the Principal Act.
SECTION 7.—RATES AND TAXES.
72. —(1.) Sums paid in Australia by the taxpayer in the year of income for rates
which are annually assessed or for State or Federal land tax or for State income tax
(other than taxes which are deductible under section seventeen of the Estate Duty Assess-
ment Act 1914-1928) for which the taxpayer is personally liable shall be allowable
deductions.
(1.) Sums for which the taxpayer is personally liable and which are paid in
Australia by him in the year of income for—
(a) rates which are annually assessed ;
(b) Federal land tax or land tax imposed under any law of a State or of
a Territory being part of the Commonwealth ; or
(c) income tax imposed under any law of a State or of a Territory being
part of the Commonwealth
(other than taxes which are deductible under section -seventeen of the Estate Duty
Assessment Act 1914-1928) shall be allowable deductions.


Explanatory Note :
This amendment is designed primarily to extend the deduction of State income
and land taxes to taxes of a similar nature imposed by a Territory of the Common-
wealth.
The opportunity has been taken to improve the structure of the sub-section
by the use of paragraphs.
SECTION B.—GIFTS, CONTRIBUTIONS ETC.
78. —(1.) The following shall, to an extent in the aggregate not exceeding the
amount of income remaining after deducting from the assessable income all other
allowable deductions except the deduction of losses of previous years and of the
statutory exemption, be allowable deductions: —
**********
(d) Calls 'on shares Calls paid by the taxpayer in the year of income on
shares owned by him in a mining company or syndicate carrying
on mining operations in Australia for gold, silver, base metals,
rare minerals or oil, or in any company carrying on afforestation
in Australia as its principal business.
Explanatory Note: —
This is a drafting amendment intended to clarify the intention of the sub-section.
SECTION 9.—STATUTORY EXEMPTION.
81.—(1.) The following amount (in this Act called “ the statutory exemption ”)
shall be an allowable deduction to any person other than a company :
(a) the sum of Two hundred and fifty pounds, less One pound for everj^
Two pounds by which the income exceeds Two hundred and fifty
pounds, or
(b) where the income does not exceed Two hundred and fifty pounds, the
amount of the income.
In this sub-section “ income ” means the residue after deducting from the
assessable income all other allowable deductions.
(2.) The deduction of the statutory exemption shall be made successively from
the income from property other than dividends, from the income from dividends,
and from the income from personal exertion.
(3.) The preceding provisions of this section shall not be applied in calculating the
amount of the taxable income subject to special properly tax, but, for the purpose of making
that calculation, there shall be deducted (where the taxpayer is not a company) from that
part of the assessable income derived from those sources which remains after all other
deductions allowable under this Act have been made, the amount of that part or the
sum of Two hundred and fifty pounds whichever is the less.
Explanatory Note: —
This amendment removes one of the special property tax provisions from the
Principal Act.
SECTION 10.—PREMIUMS INCLUDED IN ASSESSABLE INCOME.
84. —(1.) The assessable income of a taxpayer shall, except in cases in which
the next succeeding sub-section applies , include, in addition to rent, any premium
received by him in the year of income, and any consideration so received for or in
connexion with his assent to any grant or assignment of a lease.


(2.) Where a lease from the Crown of land used for primary production is assigned
or surrendered by the taxpayer, and the lease was acquired by him before the sixth year
prior to the year of income in which it is so assigned or surrendered, the amount of the
net premium received by the taxpayer as consideration for or in connexion with the
assignment or surrender shall be included in his assessable income:
Provided that the amount of any net premium (or if, in respect of the transaction,
there are more net premiums than one—the sum of the net premiums) so included
shall not exceed the total of the amounts of deductions allowed, under this Act and any
previous law of the Commonwealth to the taxpayer in respect of the lease.
Explanatory Note: —
Sub-section 2 of section 84 was inserted in the Principal Act as a special provision
relating to Crown leases of land used for primary production.
At the time of the insertion of this provision in the Principal Act it was decided
that the general question of the taxation of the proceeds from the sale of Crown
leases should be referred to Sir David Ferguson, Chairman of the Royal Commission
on Taxation.
Sir David Ferguson’s report was tabled in the House of Representatives on
18th September, 1936.
Arising from the adoption of the recommendations made in that report the
Government decided to exclude Crown leases from the application of the general
leasehold provisions and to deal with them separately in a new section. (See Section
14 of the Amending Act which inserted the new section 88a in the Principal Act
(infra, pp. 10 and 11).)
The amendment made to section 84 is necessary to give effect to the proposal
to embrace all matters relating to taxation of Crown leaseholds in the separate
section.
SECTION 11.—DEDUCTIONS.
85.—(1.) Where any premium is, under sub-section (1.) of section eighty-four
of this Act, included in the assessable income of a taxpayer of the year of income,
and—
(a) the premium is received for or in connexion with the assignment or
surrender of a lease, or for or in connexion with the goodwill or a
licence attached to or connected with land the subject of a lease
assigned or surrendered, and the taxpayer has paid any amount —
(i) to acquire that lease or the goodwill or licence attached to or
connected with that land ; or
(ii) where the lease assigned or surrendered is a lease of land —in
effecting improvements on that land; or
(b) the taxpayer has paid any amount for the surrender to him of a lease,
goodwill or licence for the purpose of granting or assigning the lease,
goodwill or licence for or in connexion with which the premium was
derived,
and the whole or any portion of that amount has not been allowed or is not allowable
as a deduction in assessments for income tax under any other provisions of this Act
or under any previous law of the Commonwealth, the amount which bears the same
proportion to the amount which has not been so allowed as the premium included in
his assessable income bears to the total of the premiums received or to be received
by him for the grant, assignment, surrender, goodwill or licence in respect of which
the premium was so included, shall be an allowable deduction.


(2.) Where any premium is, under sub-section (I.) of section eighty-four of this
Act, included in the assessable income of a taxpayer in respect of property to which
he has succeeded upon the death of another person, the taxpayer shall be entitled
to the deduction to which that other person would have been entitled, under this
section, if he had lived and the premium had been included in his assessable income
and there had been allowed or were allowable as deductions in assessments for income
tax, under any other provisions of this Act or under any previous law of the
Commonwealth the same deductions as have been so allowed or are so allowable to
the taxpayer in addition to any deductions that in fact have been or are so allowed
or allowable to that other person.
(3.) Where any premium is paid to a taxpayer for or in connexion with the grant
by him of a sub-lease, or for or in connexion with the goodwill or licence attached
to or connected with land the subject of a sub-lease so granted, and is, under sub-
section (2.) of section eighty-four of this Act, included in the assessable income of the
taxpayer of the year of income, and he has paid any amount to acquire the lease of
the premises the subject of the sub-lease or the goodwill or licence, so much of the
total deductions to which he would but for this sub-section be entitled in respect
of that amount during the period for which that sub-lease is granted as bears to
those deductions the same proportion as the premium included in his assessable
income bears to the total of the premiums received or to be received by him for the
grant of that sub-lease or for the goodwill or licence shall be an allowable deduction,
and he shall not during that period be entitled to any further deduction in respect
of that amount otherwise than under this sub-section.
{4.) Where a net 'premium is, under sub-section (2.) of section eighty-four of this
Act, included in the assessable income of a taxpayer, the deductions which 'would have
been allowable under this section had the full amount of the premium been included under
sub-section ( 1 .) of that section in the assessable income of the taxpayer, shall be taken
into account only for the purpose of ascertaining the amount of the net premium.
Explanatory Note:—
The amendments to section eighty-five are consequential upon the amendment
made to section eighty-four.
SECTION 12.—VALUE OF IMPROVEMENTS INCLUDED IN
ASSESSABLE INCOME.
87.—(1.) Where improvements, not subject to tenant rights, have been made
upon any land by any person as consideration for the grant to him of a lease of that
land, or by a lessee of the land who was required to make them under the provisions
of the lease, or who made them with the written consent of the lessor, the following
provisions shall apply :
(a) There shall be included in the lessor’s assessable income of the year in
which the improvements have been made and of each year thereafter
until and including the year in which the lease expires, an instalment
of the estimated value to the lessor of such improvements as at the
expiration of the lease. The instalments shall be equal in amount
and shall be such that, if received at the commencement of each
of those years, they would, with interest at the rate prescribed,
accumulate to a sum equal to the estimated value:


Provided that, where in the year of income, a person is the
lessor for part only of a year, a proportionate part of the instalment
shall be included in his assessable income, two or more persons have
been lessors for successive periods ihe instalment shall be included
in the assessable income of the last of those lessors.
Explanatory Note :
Section 87 (1.) of the Principal Act provides that a lessor of land on which
improvements have been effected by the lessee shall be assessed on an annual
instalment of the estimated value of the improvements at the date of expiration
of the lease.
The proviso to Section 87 (I.) was designed to apply in the year in which a sale
of the reversion was made. In the year of sale the annual instalment was assessable
pro rata to the vendor and the purchaser.
It has been found upon examination that the proviso in that form applied
also in a manner in which it was not intended to apply, viz., in a year in which sale
was not made but the lease existed for part of the year only.
It is only in rare instances that leases expire on 30th June in any year, so that
in most cases in the first and last years of the lease, the lessor would be lessor for part
only of the income year. In those cases the intentipn of section 87 (1.) (a) was that
the lessor be assessed on a full annual instalment (calculated on the number of income
years affected) to complete the assessment to him of the total amount of assessable
income contemplated by the section. Under the proviso to section 87 (1.), however,
portion only of the annual instalment could be assessed to the lessor in the first and
last years of the lease.
Section 12 not only corrects this flaw in the proviso but also simplifies its
application. By providing that in any year in which two or more persons have
been lessors the instalment shall be assessed to the last of the lessors, the liability
for assessment in the year of a sale of the reversion is definitely fixed upon the
purchaser. In so fixing the liability the apportionment of the instalment as between
vendor and purchaser is avoided.
Generally speaking, the purchaser may not be regarded as being unfairly treated
as, in the great majority of cases, the vendor in the first year of the lease will have
borne in a somewhat similar way an additional liability to assessment.
Moreover, the purchaser will be aware of his liability when arranging the terms
and conditions of his contract and will have the opportunity of taking the liability
into account.
It is considered further that, as the reversion rests with the purchaser, liability
to assessment in respect of the improvements on the leasehold land should also rest
with him.
SECTION 13.—DEDUCTIONS TO LESSEE.
gg *******
(2.) Where a taxpayer, who in the year of income is a lessee of land used for
the purpose of producing assessable income has, either before or after the


commencement of the lease, incurred expenditure in making improvements not
subject to tenant rights on that land, and such improvements—
(a) have, under an agreement entered into after the commencement of this
Act, been made as consideration for the grant to him of that lease ;
( b ) are improvements which he was required to make under the provisions
of that lease ; or
(c) have been made with the written consent of the lessor given after the
commencement of this Act,
a proportionate part of the amount of that expenditure arrived at by distributing
that amount proportionately over the period of the lease unexpired at the date when
the expenditure was incurred, shall be an allowable deduction. In calculating the
deduction under this sub-section, expenditure in excess of the amount, if any,
specified in the agreement for the lease, or in the lease, or in the lessor’s consent,
shall not be taken into account.
(3.) The provisions of the last preceding sub-section shall not apply in any case—
(a) where the lease is a lease of land to a company from an individual
or from a company to an individual, and the individual directly
or indirectly controls the voting power of the company; or
(b) where the lessor is a trustee of the land for the lessee or the lessee is a trustee
of the land for the lessor; or
(c) where the Commissioner is of the opinion that, in consequence of the
terms and conditions of the lease or of any other circumstances,
the lessor is in substantial control of the operations of the lessee
or the lessee is in substantial control of the operations of the lessor.
Explanatory Note:—
Section 88 (2.) of the Principal Act provides for a deduction to a lessee of the
cost of improvements effected by him under the provisions of the lease. Section
88 (3.) provides that the deduction shall not be granted in certain specific types of
cases where, in effect, the lessor is in substantial control of the operatiops of the
lessee. Paragraph ( h) of the sub-section specified the case where the lessor is a trustee
of the land for the lessee or the lessee is a trustee of the land for the lessor.
The limitation specified in paragraph ( b ) of the sub-section would prevent the
allowance of a deduction in future assessments in those cases in which the deduction
has been enjoyed in the past by a beneficiary who entered into his lease and building
covenant with the trustee in a perfectly bona fide manner and without intent to gain
any particular taxation advantage.
Where a beneficiary, who takes a lease from the trustee and makes
the improvements, is a life tenant in the trust estate, he should not be
deprived of the deduction. The only case which requires serious consideration
is the case where the lessor and lessee are in effect the same person under the cloak
of a trust which, in most instances, would be found to be a device to evade taxation.
Such a case is, to some extent, met by paragraph (c) of sub-section (3.) of section
88 which has the effect of excluding from the right to the deduction the case “ where
the Commissioner is of opinion that in consequence of the terms and conditions
of the lease or any other circumstances the lessor is in substantial control of the
operations of the lessee ”.
It was considered that if there were added the words “ or the lessee is in
substantial control of the operations of the lessor ”, the paragraph would sufficiently


guard against all the mischief of any real importance that was aimed at by paragraph
(b) of the sub-section which could then safely be omitted. An amendment to this
effect has therefore been made.
The amendment gives effect to a recommendation by Sir David Ferguson who
inquired into this matter.
SECTION 14.—CROWN LEASES OF LAND USED FOR PRIMARY
PRODUCTION.
88a —(1.) Except as provided in this section, the provisions of sections eighty-
four, eighty-five, eighty-six, eighty-seven and eighty-eight shall not apply to a lease
from the Crown of land used for primary production.
(2.) Where a lease from the Crown of land used for primary production has been
assigned prior to the beginning of the first year to the income of which this Act
applies and more than one premium in respect of that assignment is payable, the
assignor shall be subject to the same liability to tax, and the assignee shall be entitled
to the same right of deduction, in respect of any premiums paid during that or any
subsequent year, as they would have been if this section had not been enacted.
(3.) Where after the beginning of the first year to the income of which this
Act applies a taxpayer assigns a lease from the Crown of land used for primary
production, and the taxpayer has been allowed any deduction under this Act or any
previous law of the Commonwealth in respect of that lease, if the premium or sum
of the premiums for or in connexion with that assignment together with all
deductions so allowed, exceeds the premium or sum of the premiums paid by him
for the lease, together with the expenses directly incurred by him in effecting that
assignment (which expenses shall not otherwise be an allowable deduction), the
excess, to an amount not exceeding the sum of those deductions, (in this section
called the “ assessable amount ”) shall be taken into account in the following
manner :
(a) Where the whole premium (or sum of the premiums, as the case may
be) is received by him in the year of income—the whole of the
assessable amount shall be included in his assessable income.
(b) Where part only of the sum of the premiums is received by him in
the year of income—a proportionate part of the assessable amount
shall be included in his assessable income.
(4.) Where a taxpayer, who in the year of income is the lessee from the Crown
of land used for primary production for the purpose of producing assessable income,
has, prior to the first day of January, One thousand nine hundred and thirty-seven,
paid any premium for or in connexion with the assignment to him of the lease, a
proportionate part of the amount of that premium, arrived at by distributing that
amount proportionately over the period of the lease unexpired at the date when the
premium was paid, shall be an allowable deduction.
(5.) Where a taxpayer, who in the year of income is the lessee from the Crown
of land used for primary production for the purpose of producing assessable income,
has incurred expenditure in making improvements, not subject to tenant rights,
which, prior to the first day of January, One thousand nine hundred and
thirty-seven, he was required to make under the provisions of the lease, a
proportionate part of the amount of that expenditure, arrived at by distributing


that amount proportionately over the period of the lease unexpired at the date
when the expenditure was incurred, shall be an allowable deduction. In calculating
the deduction under this sub-section, expenditure in excess of the amount, if any,
specified in the lease shall not be taken into account.
(6.) Where, upon the death of any person, a taxpayer succeeds to any lease
from the Crown of land used for primary production, or any share therein, the
following provisions shall apply :
(a) In ascertaining the assessable amount for the purposes of sub-
section (3.) of this section—
(i) any premium paid by the deceased person for the lease, or
part thereof proportionate to the taxpayer’s share in the
lease ; or
• (ii) any deduction allowed to the deceased person under this Act
or under any previous law of the Commonwealth in respect
of that lease, or part thereof proportionate to the taxpayer’s
share in the lease,
shall be taken into account as if the premium (or the part thereof)
had been paid by or the deduction (or the part thereof) had been
allowed to the taxpayer.
(b) Where the deceased person had paid any premium as specified in sub-
section (4.) of this section or incurred any expenditure as specified
in sub-section (5.) of this section, the taxpayer shall be entitled to
the same deduction, or part thereof proportionate to his share in
the lease, as the deceased person would have been entitled to under
this section had he lived.
Explanatory Note :
The general question of the taxation of Crown leaseholds has been previously
referred to in the explanatory note to Section 10 of the Amending Act.
In his report on this question Sir David Ferguson recommended, in effect, that
Crown leases of land occupied for purposes of primary production should be treated
in the same manner as freeholds. As a consequence of the acceptance of this
recommendation the proceeds from the sale of a Crown lease would be treated as a
receipt of capital and not as income assessable to income tax. Similarly, the purchase
price of a Crown lease would not be allowable as a deduction in arriving at the taxable
income of the purchaser of the lease.
A further conclusion reached by Sir David Ferguson was that where the vendor
of a lease had received deductions in respect of any premium paid by him for the
lease, so much of the proceeds as represents the aggregate amount of the deductions
should be brought into his assessable income.
Sub-section (1.). This is a drafting clause.
Sub-section (2.). The provisions are not applicable to Crown leases assigned
prior to Ist July, 1935. With regard to transactions entered into prior to that
date any instalments of a premium received by the assignor of a lease will be assessable
income and the premium paid by the assignee will be an allowable deduction.
Sub-section (3.). This provision is designed to meet the case of a taxpayer
who, subsequently to Ist July, 1935, sells a Crown lease of land used for primary
production. As the taxpayer will have been allowed deductions in respect of any
premium paid by him, it is provided that he be assessed on the premium received
by him, but to no greater extent than the deductions allowed to him.

If the consideration for the sale of the lease is received in one year, the assessable
amount will be included in the assessable income of that year. If, however, the
assessable amount is received in instalments in two or more years, such
amount will be included pro rata in the assessable income of the years in which the
instalments are received.
The following examples illustrate the operation of this sub-section:—
Example A. —Where the “ excess ” exceeds the deductions allowed in respect of
the lease.
Assume 1. £lO,OOO premium paid for a ten years’ lease.
2. £4,000 deduction allowed in four years at the rate of £l,OOO
per annum.

Example C. —Where there is no “ excess ”.

Applying the formula set out in sub-section (3.) of section 88a—
Sub-sections (4.) and (5.). The object of these two sub-sections is to provide for
the taxpayer who, prior to Ist January, 1937, purchases a lease or incurs
expenditure on improvements, not subject to tenant rights, on leasehold land.
Under the two sub-sections a proportionate deduction vail be allowed annually to the
taxpayer in respect of the expenditure incurred by him either in purchasing the
lease or in effecting the improvements on the leasehold land.
Leasehold transactions entered into after the Ist January, 1937, will not be
subject to the provisipns of these two sub-sections. The time allowed will provide
sufficient opportunity to taxpayers and their agents to acquaiht themselves with
the amended provisions of the law.
Sub-section (6.). In this sub-section provision is made to meet the case of the
person or persons who succeed to a leasehold estate upon the death of another person.
The effect of the sub-section is that the beneficiary will be assessed on the same
amount and allowed the same deductions as the deceased person would have been
had he lived.
SECTION 15.—REBATE IN CASE OF DOUBLE AND TREBLE TAXATION.
159.—(1.) Where an amount of income derived from sources in Australia is
included in the taxable income of a non-resident taxpayer, and income tax is paid by
the taxpayer on that amount of income under the law of the United Kingdom but not
under the law of a State, and the Commonwealth rate is greater than one-half of the
British rate, the taxpayer shall be entitled to a rebate of tax of the sum obtained
by applying to that amount of income a rate which shall be—
(a) where the Commonwealth rate is greater than the British rate—one-
half of the British rate; and
( b) where the Commonwealth rate is not greater than the British rate —the
excess of the Commonwealth rate over one-half of the British rate.
(2.) Where an amount of income derived from sources in Australia is included
in the taxable income of a non-resident taxpayer, and income tax is paid by the
taxpayer on that amount of income under the law of the United Kingdom and under
the law of a State, and the sum of the Commonwealth and State rates is greater
than one-half of the British rate, the proportion which the Commonwealth rate
bears to the sum of the Commonwealth and State rates shall be ascertained, and the


taxpayer shall be entitled to a rebate of tax of the sum obtained by applying to that
amount of income a rate which shall bear that proportion to the following—
(a) where the sum of the Commonwealth and State rates is greater than
the British rate —one-half of the British rate; and
{b) where the sum of the Commonwealth and State rates is not greater than
the British rate —the excess of the sum of the Commonwealth and
State rates over one-half of the British rate.
Explanatory Note i
Section 159 of the Principal Act provided for a rebate to a non-resident taxpayer
in respect of income taxed both in the Commonwealth and in the United Kingdom.
It has come under notice that a taxpayer, under the Income Tax laws of the
Commonwealth and the United Kingdom, may be deemed to be a resident of both
Countries in respect of the same year; for example, a resident of Australia visiting
England and residing there more than six-months. In that event he would have
been liable for income tax on his Australian income both in the Commonwealth and
the United Kingdom.
It is considered that the resident of Australia should be placed in as advantageous
a position as the non-resident in regard to relief from double taxation, and by section
fifteen of the Amending Act the limitation of relief to non-residents has been removed.
SECTION 16.—AMENDMENT OF ASSESSMENTS.
170. —(1.) The Commissioner may, subject to this section, at any time amend
any assessment by making such alterations therein or additions thereto as he thinks
necessary, notwithstanding that tax may have been paid in respect of the
assessment.
(2.) Where a taxpayer has not made to the Commissioner a full and true
disclosure of all the material facts necessary for his assessment, and the Commissioner
is of opinion that there has been an avoidance of tax, the Commissioner may—
(а) where he is of opinion that the avoidance of tax is due to fraud or
evasion—at any time ; and
(б) in any other case—within six years from the date upon which the tax
became due and payable under the assessment,
amend the assessment by making such alterations therein or additions thereto, as
he thinks necessary to correct an error in calculation or a mistake of fact or to prevent
avoidance of tax as the case may be.
Explanatory Note: —
This is a drafting amendment to delete the first of the two references to the
opinion of the Commissioner.
SECTION 17.—COMMISSIONER MAY COLLECT TAX FROM PERSON OWING
MONEY TO TAXPAYER.
218. —(1.) The Commissioner may at any time, or from time to time, by notice
in writing (a copy of which shall be forwarded to the taxpayer at his last place of
address known to the Commissioner), require—
(а) any person by whom any money is due or accruing or may become
due to a taxpayer;
(б) any person who holds or may subsequently hold money for or on
account of a taxpayer;
(c) any person who holds or may subsequently hold money on account
of some other person for payment to a taxpayer; or
(d) any person having authority from some other person to pay money
to a taxpayer,


to pay to him, forthwith upon the money becoming due or being held, or within such
further time as the Commissioner, Second Commissioner, or Deputy Commissioner
allows, the money or so much thereof as is sufficient to pay the amount due by the
taxpayer in respect of any tax and of any fines and costs imposed upon him under
this Act. the Commissioner, either forthwith upon the money becoming due or being
held, or at or within a time specified in the notice (not being a time before the money
becomes due or is held) —
(i) so much of the money as is sufficient to pay the amount due by the
taxpayer in respect of any tax and of any fines and costs imposed
upon him under this Act, or the whole of the money when it is equal
to or less than that amount; or
(ii) such amount as is specified in the notice out of each of any payments
which the person so notified becomes liable from time to time to
make to the taxpayer, until the amount due by the taxpayer in
respect of any tax and of any fines and costs imposed upon him
under this Act is satisfied,
and may at any time, or from time to time, amend or revoke any such notice, or
extend the time for making any payment in pursuance of the notice.
(2.) Any person who fails to comply with any notice under this section shall
be guilty of an offence.
Penalty: Fifty pounds.
(3.) Where the amount payable to the taxpayer by the person so notified is less
than the amount due by the taxpayer, that person shall pay to the Commissioner in
reduction of the amount so due the amount payable by that person to the taxpayer.
Explanatory Note: —
Section 218 of the Principal Act repeated the provisions of section 65 of the
1922-1934 Assessment Act. It was found, however, that the section did not give
full power to the Commissioner to accept or require payment of tax by instalments.
As this method of payment of tax is, in some cases, to the advantage both of the
taxpayer and the Taxation Department, provision has been made by section 17
of the Amending Act empowering the Commissioner to collect tax by instalments
from a person owing money to the taxpayer.
SECTION 18—DEDUCTION OF SPECIAL PROPERTY TAX FROM
PREFERENCE SHAREHOLDERS.
253. A company which has paid or is liable to pay special property tax may
notwithstanding anything contained in its memorandum or articles of association, or
in any other document or agreement, deduct from any dividends payable to the preference
shareholders of the company an amount equal to the amount of special property tax
which it has paid or is liable to pay upon taxable income distributed to its preference
shareholders.
Explanatory Note:—
This amendment removes one of the Special Property Tax provisions from the
Principal Act.
SECTION 19.—APPLICATION OF ACT.
Explanatory Note:—
Section 19 provides that the amendments shall apply to assessments for the
current financial year, which is the first year to which the Principal Act applies.
By Authority: L. F. Johnston, Commonwealth Government Printer, Canberra.
