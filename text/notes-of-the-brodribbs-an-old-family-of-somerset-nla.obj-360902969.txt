PREFACE.
These notes of the Brodribb families require little preface.
More than half a century ago, I was at Glutton, visiting my Uncle Thomas
James Brodribb, then an old man of nearly 70. He dwelt there, in an old-
fashioned house, built in 1 702 by his great grandfather, John Brodribb. The
date 1702 is on the gable-front, the year in which the latter married and
brought home his bride to the newly-built house, which was successively occu-
pied by his son Uriah (born 1725); then by his grandson, Thomas (my grand-
father, born 1764; and finally by his great-grandson (my uncle, Thomas James
Brodribb, born 1794), at whose death in 1870 it passed away from the family.
It appears that in consequence of a law-suit about 90 years ago the
Brodribbs were required to trace their pedigree to John Brodribb, above-men-
tioned. When visiting my uncle, I learned that this pedigree was in his pos-
session, and I gladly copied it as a matter of interest. It then began with
John Brodribb, and ended with the children of Thomas Brodribb—
four generations. During the ninety years or so that have since
elapsed, other generations have been add°d; and by the re-
search of my dear kinsman, the late Mr. U. Bower Brodribb, of Highgate,
among the wills in the Registry at Wells, the name of the father of John
Brodribb has been added, thus bringing down the line of direct descent from
the time of Charles 1., instead of from Charles 11. Another esteemed kins-
man, Mr. Arthur Aiken Brodribb, now of Yattendon, Berkshire, has from
various sources given me notes of bygone Brodribbs, which I have copied into
this record. ,
In 1864, I emigrated from England to Victoria, where, except for a visit
to Europe, in 1913-14, I have since resided. I remember many tombs of my
kindred in the Glutton Churchyard; they were very near the church; and, on
my visit therein 1913, I learned with deep regret that they had long ago
removed to make way for the extension of the church, only one of such tombs,
that of Matthew Brodribb remaining. In another place, I give a copy of the
inscriptions on it. The earliest forms of the family name were Baketrepe (or
Baketerpe), Baggedrip, Baudrip, Brodrip. The important branch of the
Brodrepps, country squires of South Maoerton, Dorset, from the reism of
James 1., came also from Somerset; they died out :‘n the 18th Century. These
Brodrepps, though originating from Somerset, and presumably of the same
ancestry, were not apparently allied in the 17th Century to my branch; but
their genealogy is fully given in Hutchison’s History of Dorsetshire, a work
contained in the Melbourne Public Library.
This record and the genealogies which follow are here printed by direc-
tion of myself and my kinsman, Mr. Francis Kenric Brodribb. of Brisbane, as
a matter of interest to present and future generations of Brodribbs.

ORIGIN AND EARLIEST MEMBERS OF THE BRODRIBB FAMILY.
See Collinson’s History of Somersetshire, Vol. 3, pp. 91-3.
Bawdrip is a village near Bridgewater, in Somerset, anciently Bagetrepc.
It was held in William the Conqueror’s days by Walter de Douai.
In the time of Edward I. (1272-1307), Richard de Conteville held a knight’s
fee in the village of Bagdripe of Hugh, Lord Lovel of Castle Carey, which fee
was some time held by a family who assumed their name from the place, and
are supposed to have been the progenitors of the family of Brodrepp, of South
Maperton (Dorset), and other families of that name situated in different parts
of the kingdom.
The earliest forms of the name are Bagetrepe, Baggedripe, Baudrip and
Brodrip. As early as the thirteenth century, the form Brodrib is found.
The earliest recorded member of the family seems to be Robert de Bake-
trepe, or Baketerpe, who held lands at Bawdrip in the time of Henry 11. (1154-
nSg).
Robert de Baggedrippe, in 1291, gave to the church of St. Athelwin of
Athelney, the church of Baggedrip (sic), belonging to him jure patronatus,
and William de Baggedrippe, his son, ratified the grant. ,
Adam de Baudrip had lands also at Bawdrip, likewise at North Petherton;
temp. 38th year of Edward I. (about 1300).
John de Baudrip, Lord of the Manor, in the 43rd year of Edward 111.
(about 1350), granted to Sir John Combe, Knight, a yearly rental of £2O, to
be paid out of all his lands and tenements in Bawdrip and Washford.
This John de Baudrip bore on his seal a cross argent between four shel-
drakes proper.
The said Sir John Combe, who died c. 1363, was then seized of two parts
of the manor of Bawdrip, with the reversion of the third part, which Orengia
Brodrip held in dower of Richard, son and heir of Michael Seymour, as of his
manor of Castle Carey.
William Baudrip, Esquire, son of Thomas Baudrip, in the 3 7th year of
Henry VI. (about 1459), released to John Wroughton, Esq., of Broad Hinton
(Wilts), all his right to the manor of Bawdrip, and to his lands at Washford,
Walpole, Stretchill, Chedzoy and Chilton.
About the latter part of Queen Elizabeth’s reign, David Kemys, Esq., ci
Kevanmably, in the country of Glamorgan, married Katharine, daughter of
Sir William Baudrip. Their grandson. Sir Michael Kemys (1642) was the
first baronet of that line. ('Burke’s History of the Commoners, Vol. IV., p.
184). N.B.—Name in diverse forms—-Camoes, Camys, Cameis, Kemys,
Kemmis—a Norman name on the roll of Battle Abbey.

According to Bardsley’s “Dictionary of Names,” it is a local name, de-
rived from Bawdrip, near Bridgewater. The second syllable, drip, is sup-
posed to be the word thoroe, thrup, thrip—a village or hamlet akin to the
Dutch Dorp and the German Dorf.
The first syllable I cannot explain, but it may mean Elder tree, which
according to Ernest Weekly’s “Romance of Names,” is in old English called
Bawtry or Bawtree. If so, it might mean the village or hamlet by the Elder
trees. Bardsley remarks that in this name, and in that of Broderick, the
first R. in intrusive, not ha.vine existed in its early forms. The three earliest
instances of the intrusive R appear to be:—
1260 Robert Brodrib.
1327 Peter Brodribbe.
1363 Orengia Brodrip.

NOTES OF LATER BRODRIBBS DOWN TO THE 17th CENTURY.
Furnished by Mr. Arthur Aiken Brodribb, November, 1913.
1. In the year 1260, Robert Brodrib appeared in the return made of the
demesne tenants of Glastonbury Abbey. (Notes and Queries, June 8, 1912).
2. In 1327, Peter Brodribbe was one of the tenants living within the
boundary of Glaston Twelve Hides. (Ibid).
3. From 1472 to 1496 Tohn Broderybbe was rector of Shilgate, Exmoor.
(List of Somerset Incumbents.)
4. In 1581, Thomas and William Brodrybbe, from Somerset, matriculated
respectively at Oriel and Magdalen Colleges. (Oxford University Register.)
c. In 1588, in the Muster Roll for the defence of Somerset, in the time
■of the Armada, William Brodribbe, of the town of Glastonbury, supplied “a
pair of breastplates, seven bows, seven sheafs of arrows, one sword, a dagger
and twelve bills.” (Somerset Record Society, Vol. XX., p. 294.)
6. In 1620 was proved the will of Isabel Brodrib, with a bequest to Wells
Cathedral.
In 1622 appears the following entry in the Order Book of Corpus Christi
College, Cambridge:—“ltem proposita quaestione, an aliquid fuerit in ludo
scenico Dmi. Brodrib quod justam offensam Dmi. Bacon de Verulam posset in-
currere, responderunt omnes et singuli quod nihil ejusmodi in illo ludo fuisse
(sic).”
N.B.—“Dominus” (Sir, Mr., Lord) was the official title wherewith mem-
bers of the University designated each other when addressing them or when
speaking of them in Latin. We cannot imagine what was the phrase in
■“Dominus” Brodrib’s play which might give offence to Dominus Bacon (Francis
Bacon, Viscount Verulam). The ex-Lord Chancellor Bacon the previous year
had been accused of taking bribes, being punished by imprisonment and a
fine of £40,000; but the fine was remitted and the imprisonment limited to
two days’ duration. The translation is “Also the question being put as to
whether there was anything in Dominus Brodrib’s play which could give real
-offence to Dominus Bacon of Verulam, one and all declared that there was
nothing of that kind in the play.
8. In 1631, John Brodribb administered to the will of George Ellis. (These
17th century instances are innumerable.)


(Mostly from Burke’s General Armory, 1878.)
1. John de Baudrip (c. 1350) bore on his seal a cross argent, between four
sheldrakes proper. (Collinson’s History of Somerset.)
2. Francis Broderip, Esquire (Gower Street, Bedford Square, London).
Gules, a cross couped, or, oetween tour barnacle fowls, argent. Crest—demi-
griffin salient;
3. Broderip, of Copington Manor, near Bridgewater, bore the same as
4. Brodrepp, of South Maperton (line extinct). Gules, a cross argent,
between four swans proper (nearly the same as No. 1).
5. Bawdripp, Broderip, Brodribb. Gules, three swans close, argent
Crest: in a cap or, 3 roses gules, slipped and leaved vert.
6. Bawdrip, Broderip, Brodribb. Gules, on a fess argent, two lioncels
azure rampant; three cross-crosslets fitchee argent in the middle chief and
the dexter and sinister bases respectively; and three escallop shells argent
in the sinister base and in the dexter and sinister chief respectively. Crest:
Demi-griffin proper, rampant. These are the arms which tradition assigns to
my branch of the Brodribbs, though not recognised as such by the Heralds’
College. It may be noted that they are similar to another escutcheon re-
corded in Burke’s Armory under the name of Bawrip (? Bawdrip) (See No. 7).
To my knowledge, there is no mention made elsewhere of such a name as
Bawrip.
7. Bawrip (supposed error for Bawdrip). Gules, on a fess argent, two
lions passant azure. Over all a pale per saltire argent and sable; in the
dexter chief two escallops; in the sinoister base, a cross-crosslet fitchee of the
second; in the sinister chief two cross-crosslets; in the dexter base, one
of the last.
I am unable to say whether this escutcheon is heraldically correct.
It may be noted that Christopher Morgan, whose daughter and co-heiress,
Mary, married Richard Brodrepp, c. 1608, bore the crest of a griffin salient.

REPUTED ARMORIAL BEARINGS.


TOPOGRAPHiCAL HOTES.
Bawdrip, a village near Bridgewater, Somerset, from which the Brodribb
Broderip, Brodrepp families took their name.
Brockley, a parish 9 miles S.W. of Bristol.
Cameley (in Domesday Book, Cameley), a village near Glutton, some of its
houses being in the hamlet of Temple Cloud.
Chelwood. near Chew, anciently Celeworte, then Chelworth,. and ultimately
Chelwood, a little village near Glutton.
Chew, a little river, which from the Mendip Hills runs into the River Avon,
gives its name to Chew, Chewton, Chewstoke (in Domesday Book, Chewe-
stock) and Chew Magna. The last was once a large and populous parish
with a busy cloth industry.
Glutton, the home of my branch of the Brodribbs until 1870; mentioned in
Domesday Book as Clutone. It lies 10 miles from Bristol, 12 miles from
Bath, and 10 miles from Wells. The ancient family of the Grevilles in
very early times owned most of the land there; subsequently their suc-
cessors, the Earls of Warwick, just as at present.
Compton Dando, a village on the River Chew; 7 miles from Bath, 7 miles from
Bristol, named from its owners.
Hallatrow, in Domesday Book, Hel'getrev (holy village), is a subdivision of
High Littleton Parish. The Gurneys (Gournai) held the land in the time
of Edward 111. (1327-1377); Wm. Gore Langton recently.
Harptree, East Harptree and West Harptree are villages lying a little farther
form Bristol, and nearer to Wells, partly on the north side of Mendip (in
Domesday Book called Harpetre). It came into possession of Wm. de
Perceval, one of the Conqueror’s barons under the Bishop of Coutance; and
this baron assumed the name of Baron of Harptree.
High Littleton, a village about a mile away from Glutton.
Woollard, a hamlet in the parish of Campton Dando.
The foregoing villages have generally fertile agricultural land, and in
some of them much coal mining is carried on.
These topographical details are taken from Collinson’s History of
Somersetshire, published in 1791, by subscription. The list of subscribers,
very large, is headed by the King. Among them are William Brodribb, Esq.,
Mr. Edward Broderip, Wells, and Mr. William Broderip, Bristol.
