Patch sat outside the farm
gate feeling very sad. No one seemed to like
him any more. Mrs. Legs, his mistress, had driven
him from the house with angry words, and all
because of that stupid
poodle who had come to stay.
At least Patch wouldn't

met Mr. Legs, who held a
well-chewed hot water bottle in one
hand, and
threatening stick in the
other. His voice sounded awfully
angry, and Patch ran round to the
back of the barn, where he hid in
some hay, all the time keeping
one eye on watch for his master. After

seeing a ball lying in the yard, he
thought he'd have a game with it.
First he barked at it a few times, and then
sniffed it, but as soon as he did this, the ball

Out on the road everything
looked very big and frightening.
but Patch soon forgot his fear
when he met a friendly
tortoise going for a walk. The

soon said goodbye and trotted off by himself.
Presently he

After this they both started to chase rabbits
in a field, but the rabbits disappeared quickly
down their burrows. Patch, trying to follow
of them, got his nose stuck
firmly in one of the holes.
