NOW, Frankie, off you go to
market! ” said Mummy
Fox, one fine morning. “ Don’t
forget the shopping-list, will you
dear ? ”
“I never forget, Mum!” boasted
Frankie. “ Trust me ! ”
But, alas, pride goes before a fall!
Frankie crammed the piece of paper
into his pocket so hastily that it fell
out again in no time !
“ Well, I never ! Trust you,
indeed ! ” laughed Mummy Fox,
putting the list into Frankie’s pocket
herself “ Now, remember, don’t
stop to play with Kenny Kangaroo
this morning,” she added. “ I need
the shopping done- quickly, don’t
forget, because I have a lot of cooking
to do for tomorrow.”
“Trust me, Mum ! ” cried
Frankie again, skipping to the gate.
But, do you know, the merry little
Fox did forget his Mummy’s words
the moment he started off to the
village, for Frankie was keeping a
sharp look-out for Kenny Kangaroo,
his chum, who lives in another cottage
further along the lane.
Now Frankie and Kenny were
the best of friends, really, but they
did love to play tricks on each other.
Luckily, the little fellows never turned
cross or sulky, for it was all in good
fun.
“Ah—ha! There’s Kenny now!”
cried Frankie, suddenly spotting his
chum. “ I’ve got a fine idea ! ”
With that, Frankie raced along
the lane till he reached the next stile.
And when Kenny Kangaroo
came along, there sat Frankie, looking
ever so sad, with one of his shoes
lying on the ground !




“ Well, I’ll go hippitty-
hop ! ” cried Kenny. (All the
Kangaroo family said that when
they felt surprised!) “ What’s
the matter, Frankie ? Why
haven’t you got your shoe on ?”
“ Oh, it seems much more
comfortable when it’s off ! ”
sighed Frankie—which was
quite true.
“Ah! That means your
shoe is too tight, I expect,” said
Kenny, looking very wise.
“ Would you like a piggy-back
to market ? ”
“ Oh, Kenny, you are
kind ! ” cried Frankie, for that
was just what he did want.
And, picking up his basket and
shoe, the artful little joker
climbed on his chum’s back.
“ Oof ! Poof ! ” panted
Kenny, after carrying Frankie
for quite a way. “ I couldn’t —
whew !—go hippitty—puff—hop
now ! ”
“ Then let us rest,” smiled
Frankie. “ I say, Kenny, just
look at those lovely apples on
Farmer Bull’s tree ! I wish I
could get you some—but I don’t
feel able to climb a tree just
now. Isn’t it a pity that you
Kangaroos can’t climb at all ! ”
“Ho!” cried Kenny,
proudly. “ Let me tell you, my
fine Fox, that we noble Kang-
aroos don’t need to climb trees,
anyway! I’ll soon show you how
we get apples! ”
Kenny set Frankie down.
Then he gave a huge kangaroo-
jump into the air, and with one
swish of his long tail, he knocked
a shower of juicy apples off
the tree !
“ How very clever of you,
Kenny ! ” chuckled Frankie,
packing the apples quickly into
his basket.
Just then, the young imps
heard stern Farmer Bull coming.




“ Ha, ha ! ” laughed Frankie.
“ That will take you about a month,
old slowcoach, at the rate you are
working ! ”
“ Nonsense ! ” grunted Peter
Porker. “I’d like to see you do it
any faster, young Frankie ! ”
That was quite enough for
Frankie! In the twinkling of an
eye, the little Fox jumped off
Kenny’s back and climbed right to
the top of the shed. Once again
Frankie had forgotten all about his
Mummy’s shopping. And he also
forgot that he was supposed to have
a ‘ bad foot ’!




“ Well, I’ll go hippitty-hop ! ”
said Kenny to himself. “So Frankie
hasn’t got a sore foot after all, and he
has made me carry him all for nothing
—and get the applet, too! Very well,
Master Frankie—ver-ree well! Now
it’s my turn to play a trick on you, my
fine Fox ! ”
So Kenny waited patiently until
the green paint had been dabbed
all over the shed. This did not take
long, thanks to Frankie’s busy tail,
and suddenly the little Fox remem-
bered his Mummy’s shopping.
“ Oh, dear, I must hurry to the
village ! ” he cried. “ But I simply
can’t go shopping with a bright green
tail! Everyone will laugh at me !
Whatever shall I do ? ”
“ Wash your tail under the pump,
duffer ! ” cried Kenny. “ Peter will
get you a towel and some soap, won’t
you, Peter ? ”
“ Yes, certainly, ” said good-
natured Peter, trotting into the mill
with a smile.
“ Thank you! That’s fine! ” cried
Frankie, when Peter came back with
soap and towel. The little Fox ran to
the pump-tank and dipped his bright
green tail into it.
However, it so happened that the
pump would not work very well, so
Frankie had to go off to another pump,
where there was only a bucket to wash
in. But that proved slow work, too,
and at last, Kenny Kangaroo shook
his head sternly at Peter Porker.
“I say, Peter, I do think you
might help Frankie a bit more after
the nice way he has helped you ! ”
cried Kenny. “You might at least


'Mr*

pump some more water for him.”
“Eh ? Oh, I am sorry—l never
thought! ” cried Peter, who was
rather a simple lad. “Yes, I’ll go
and help Frankie at once.”
Peter trotted up behind Frankie,
and then grasped the pump handle.
But, horrors ! In his eagerness,
poor Peter worked the pump-handle
so hard that up gushed a great torrent
of water! It missed the bucket and
flew all over Frankie Fox, drenching
him from head to foot!
“Ow ! Help ! Fire ! Ship-
wreck ! ” yelled Frankie, falling
backwards into the bucket. “ Save
the women and children first.!
Where’s my umbrella ! ”
“ Oh, trotters ! ” gasped Peter;
and he was so surprised that he kept
on pumping away while Frankie got
wetter and wetter, and Kenny Kang-
aroo quietly hopped away, laughing
to himself.
What a to-do there was then !
Luckily, a Fox does not come to much
harm from a wetting, and, as the sun
was hot, Frankie did not really mind
at all. But, of course, he made a
tremendous fuss, and scolded poor
Peter up hill and down dale.
“ I never knew such a clumsy
Porker in all my born days! ” cried
Frankie, severely. “ Hullo, what is
Kenny up to now ? ”
At that, moment, Kenny came
back into the yard, carrying a plank
of wood. “ I’m going to help Peter
mend the windmill,” he said, loftily.
“But you had better trot off to the
shops, Frankie. I know you’re not
good at mending things, are you ? ”






“ Ha, ha, ha ! Look at poor
Frankie now ! ”
It was Kenny Kangaroo’s turn to
laugh this time, and he roared ! He
knew that you could always make
Frankie Fox do something if you first
told him he could not do it!
“ Oh, Frankie, you do look all
stuck up! ” laughed Kenny. “ Can’t
you climb down from a poor old
windmill ? ”
“ You think you’re funny, don’t
you ? ” puffed Frankie, as Kenny ran
away, still laughing fit to burst his
sides.
“Well, I don’t think it’s funny,”
said Peter Porker, in his solemn way.
“It looks very dangerous to me,
Frankie. Why don’t you climb
down ? ”
“Because I’m caught up ! ” gasped
Frankie. “ I c-can’t. . .Oh, my ”
Crack! With a loud snapping-
sound, the old sail broke to splinters
under him. Down went Frankie ;
down-down-down!
“ Don’t forget your bad foot,
Frankie ! ” shouted Kenny, popping
his head out of a window.
“ He-e-e-elp ! ” was all Frankie
could squeal, as he whizzed through
the air.
Now isn’t it lucky that a fox can
fall a long, long way without hurting
himself at all! Indeed, Frankie, for
all his fright, could have landed quite
safely on his four paws if it had not
been for Mrs. Porker’s clothes-line,
which was stretched across the yard.
Twang-g-g ! hummed the line,
snapping in two as Frankie fell right
on it. Next moment, the little Fox
went plop into a great wash-basket
full of clothes, while all the washing




on the line flapped around him !
“ Frankie Fox ! Oh, you bad
boy! ” cried Mrs. Porker, running
out of the mill in a great state.
“ What were you trying to do ?—jump
over my clothes-line, I’ll be bound !
Now you just mend it, and hang up
all the washing again ! ”
“Ow ! Yes, ma’am! Certainly,
ma’am! ” squeaked Frankie. “ Trust
me, ma’am! ”
Thanks to the wash-basket, he
was not hurt one bit. And no sooner
had he mended the line, and hung up
all the clothes, than his chums came
into the yard again. Percy Porker
was pushing a barrow with a sack of
flour in it. - But Kenny was sitting
the barrow, still laughing fit to split!
“ All right, Kenny, you’ve won
all the tricks to-day,” grinned Frankie,
like a good sportsman. “ But I’m in
a fine pickle now ! ” he added, sadly.
“ I promised Mummy I’d fetch the
shopping back quickly. Now I’ll be
awfully late, all through your tricks! ”
Peter Porker gazed solemnly at
the chums.
“You chaps are always playing
tricks on each other, and I can’t
understand you ! ” he said, shaking
his head. “ But you have helped me,
Frankie, so now I’ll help you ! ”
With that, the good-natured Peter
got his father’s car out, and drove the
happy chums to the shops. And
although Peter drove very slowly,
the old car got Frankie home nice and
early after all !
“ Oh, Frankie, I am pleased with
you! ” cried Mummy Fox, when
Frankie gave her the shopping.
“ You’ve been very quick and you
haven’t forgotten a single thing ! ”
“ Ha, ha ! Always trust me.
Mum ! ” laughed Frankie Fox. And
off he went to play another little joke
on his good friend, Kenny Kangaroo !
