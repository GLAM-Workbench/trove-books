PREFACE.
JT had long been the wish of the late Mr. Ramsay of Kildalton to
print the more important documents of his charter-chest, but
it was not till shortly after the appearance of Mrs. Ramsay’s Stent
Booh of Islay that his resolve took definite form. It soon, however,
became evident that the volume would prove of but limited interest,
partly on account of the scantiness of the documents, partly because
they were almost entirely legal or statistical. Moreover, the oldest
document was dated 1614, the year of the advent of the Campbells of
Calder : there was nothing to represent the earlier and more stirring
period when the island was under the sway of the Clandonald. The
loss of the older writs was due to a long series of disasters
incident to the stormy history of the island. As early as 1542, and
again in 1558, we hear of the wholesale destruction or plunder of Islay
charters. Between 1639 and 1650, during the Montrose troubles, the
Laird of Calder’s charter-chest was carried about between Edinburgh,
O 7
Stirling, and Glasgow, and was even lost for a time. Many papers
had strayed to Cawdor Castle, the ancestral seat of the Islay lairds,
before Campbell of Shawfield acquired the island and removed the
residue to his house at Woodhall. When Mr. Ramsay entered into pos


session he had permission to take a number of these documents to Kil-
dalton : what remained at Woodhall perished soon after in the fire
which destroyed that mansion. The Kildalton collection is thus but
a remnant of a remnant.
For these reasons it was deemed advisable to go afield and gather what
documents could be found in private and public collections. Since this
search began, the scheme of the book has been enlarged. The papers have
been arranged, not in subject-groups as in the original plan, but in chrono-
logical sequence ; translations have been appended to all documents not in
the vernacular; and an historical introduction, notes, appendices, and a
full index have added weight and perhaps some usefulness to the bulky
volume. One deep regret remains, that Mr. Ramsay did not survive
to see the fulfilment of his cherished design, towards which the
antiquarian enthusiasm of Mrs. Ramsay and the active sympathy
of Sir Arthur Mitchell, Mr. J. R. Findlay, and Dr. Joseph Anderson
had already contributed so much. Since her husband’s death Mrs.
Ramsay has continued her interest in the work, and to her we are
indebted for its completion.
The majority of the documents, excluding those in the Kildalton chest,
have been found in the General Register House, Edinburgh, in the Den-
mylne and Balcarres Collections in the Advocates’ Library, at Cawdor
Castle, and in the Record Offices at London and Dublin : others are
taken from the Collections of the Duke of Argyll and Mr. Fraser-
Mackintosh, and the libraries at Lambeth Palace and the Vatican.
Some papers which have been printed before, at length or in abstract,
have been included in order to make the record of the island as
complete as possible: of these the greater number have appeared in
the extracts from the Denmylne MSS. in Pitcairn’s Criminal Trials,


Cosmo Innes’s Thanes of Cawdor, and the Register of the Privy Council,
edited by Professor Masson, Historiographer-Royal.
The volume concludes with the early decades of the eighteenth century,
when the romantic period of Islay history had passed away. The docu-
ments of later date in the Kildalton chest have only the commonplace
interest of accounts of factory or deeds of wadset, but a few which deal
with the industrial development of the island after the ’Forty-Five have
been placed in the Appendix. There is already ample material for the
domestic history of Islay during later times in the Stent Booh, which
covers the period from 1718 to 1843.
In the making of a book such as this, which refused to be defined in
scope, and threatened to be as careless of time, promoter and editor have
relied on a wide co-operation. It is my pleasant duty to convey the
thanks of Mrs. Ramsay and family to those who have kindly placed the
documents in their possession at my disposal, and in especial to the
Duke of Argyll, the Earl of Cawdor, and Mr. C. Fraser-Mackintosh,
and to Dr. Cochran-Patrick for inquiries concerning the family docu-
ments of the Earl of Antrim; and to express my gratitude to
Mr. Clark, of the Advocates’ Library, and Dr. Dickson, of the
General Register House, for facilities and advice in consulting the
manuscripts in their keeping. I owe a more personal debt to Mr. York
Powell, of Christ Church, Oxford, for translating the extracts from the
Norse Sagas, and to Mr, T. G. Law, of the Signet Library, the late Dr.
W. F. Skene, the late Mr. Hector Mac Lean, Balligrant, and Mrs. Maturin
for the solution of sundry difficulties : with which pleasant indebtedness
I would link my deep obligations to the late Mr. Donald Gregory’s invalu-
able History of the Western Highlands and Isles of Scotland. Most of
the transcripts from the Denmylne Collection have been made by the


Rev. Walter MacLeod, to whom I am indebted for not a few
suggestions ; Mr. D. Nichol Smith has kindly read the proofs ; and
Mr. George F. Black has provided the Index. Lastly, I would thank
Mr. Sommerville Greig, W.S., whose assiduous interest has made more
easy my attempt to carry out Mr. Ramsay’s munificent design.
In the Addenda, on page 559*, will be found an additional letter
of Bishop Andrew Knox, printed from the original in the Laing
Collection in the University of Edinburgh, and a description of the
engravings of the four seals, which were inserted when the greater part
of the volume was printed off.
A request to the reader to look kindly on errors is made seriously
and in no conventional manner, for I am deeply conscious that there
must be many shortcomings in a book of this kind, crammed with
facts from so many sources, and so long in the making.
G. GREGORY SMITH.

INTRODUCTION.




INTRODUCTION.
mHE earliest references to the island of Islay are in the hazy narrative
of the Irish chroniclers, where it appears, first, as part of the plunder
of the mysterious Firbolg (p. 1, n.), and thereafter, in the fifth century,
as the adopted home of a branch of the family of the great Ere, son of
Eachach, The story of this settlement (p. 2) is too circumstantial to be
altogether mythical, and it is not difficult to identify the names of
the small colonies with those of districts on the modern map. Of the
history of this community during the next four centuries there is nothing
on record beyond a few picturesque glimpses in the pages of Adam-
nan : how St. Cainneach by dint of prayer recovered his staff on Island
Texa (p. 437), how Lugne Mocumin was made prior of the northern islet
Naomb (p. 438), how Feredach, a rich man of Islay, treacherously
murdered the noble Piet Tarain, who had sought his protection by the
advice of St. Columba, and how the murderer died soon thereafter (ib.).
Between this act of poetic justice and the coming of the Norse rovers we
hear of nothing but the ominous earthquake which troubled the island
in the spring of 740 (ib.).
The Norse had harried the coasts of the Sudreys, and Ketil Flatnef had
settled there, before the coming of Harold Harfagr about 870 ; but with
the conquest by the latter of all the western islands as far as Man really
begins the history of the island. The reader will find in the Appendix a
record of the Viking raids in the West which preceded the sack of the
island by Magnus Barefoot described on p. 4. The Norse connection


with the island is implied rather than expressed, though we find Paul,
son of Thorfinn, associated with it about 1064, and the father of Godred
Crowan called Harold the Black of Islay (p. 439). More specific
references are the expulsion of Gil-Adoxnnan, son of Somerled, from
the island in 1083, and the death of Godred Crowan there- in 1095.
During the second expedition of Magnus Barefoot, in 1098, the island
was pillaged and burnt by the Norse.
“ There was smoke over Isla, when the prince’s men were increasing the conflagrations.”
So runs the line in Bjorn, probably the first mention of the island in
verse. The islanders fared little better at the hands of Magnus during
his third expedition in 1102—3, of Cadwallader in 1135, and of Uspak-
Hakon in 1230. A quaint account of the doings of Hakon and his men
in Islay-Sound will be found on p. 8. The last important event in the
story of the Norse subjugation took place in August 1263 (p. 9), when
the island was surrendered to Hakon IV. of Norway.
“ The swift-spoken Norwegian king held eastward
In his glorious galleys into the Sudreys :
Angus gave up the spoil of war,
Isla to the keen king.”
Three years later the temporal power of the Norse in the West came to
an end by treaty with Alexander HI. (p. 441).
From Angus who had “ given up the spoil of war ” sprang the line
of the Lords of Isla, the Lords of the Isles and Earls of Boss, and the
House of Isla and Kintyre, who ruled in the island till the seventeenth
century. The involved story of the rise of this family is beyond our
present purpose, and there would be little to add to the account in
Donald Gregory’s invaluable History of the Western Highlands and
Isles} Their connection with the island is first established by the
succession of Reginald (p. 5, n.), son of Somerled, who had in 1160
obtained in Norway, from King Inge, the title of King of the Sudreys.
Reginald’s son Donald succeeded to. the lands of Islay and Kintyre,

probably bolding the former, as his father and grandfather had done,
of the Norwegian Crown. His son was the foresaid Angus of the Saga,
known as Angus Mor by the Sennachies, and styled in the records “ de
Yla ” or “de Insulis,” indifferently with the head of the younger
branch of the MacEuaris of Bute. Angus, by the treaty of 1266, trans-
ferred his island allegiance to the King of Scots. He died in Islay in
1294 (p. 441). His son Angus, known as Angus Oig, threw in his lot
with the Bruce, chiefly through opposition to his kinsman Alexander
of Lorn, who was a partisan of the Comyn and his friends. He
was rewarded by Bruce with a part of Alexander’s lands of Jura,
Coll, Tiree, Durror, and Glenco, and the Crown lands of Kenalban
(Morvern) and Ardnamurchan; and he seems to have shared the
lordship of Lochaber with Roderic or Euari Mac Alan (p. 12, n.).
Through the subsequent forfeiture of Roderic in 1325 for insubordina-
tion (p. 442) he became the most powerful chief in the West;
but he did not enjoy his influence long, for he died in Islay in the
following year. His son John, who had never been loyal to the house
of Bruce, openly proved his allegiance to Edward Baliol by an inden-
ture made in 1335 (pp. 12—13), in which Baliol granted him his patri-
mony, though he qualified his gift with the timid phrase quantum in
se est. On the restoration of David 11. in 1341, John was deprived of
his lands in Islay, which may or may not have been conveyed to Angus
Maclan of Ardnamurchan (p. 14, n.); but he made such spirited
resistance that David, anxious to show a united front in the conflict
with England, granted him a charter of the island and other lands
on 12th June 1343 (pp. 14—15). A brief note on his subsequent career
till his death at Ardtornish in Morvern will be found in the footnote
there. He was a friend to the clergy, and through them earned the
title of “ Good John of Isla.” He gave liberally to the abbey of lona,
and, in his own island, repaired the fabric and enriched the ceremonial
of the chapels of Orsay and Finlagan, He was the first to use the style
“ Lord of the Isles ” (Dominus Insularum), which he had adopted soon


after the death of his brother-in-law Ranald Macßuari in 1346. 1 By
a second marriage, with Margaret, daughter of Robert the High Steward,
he had three sons, the eldest of whom, Donald, succeeded as second Lord
of the Isles. He had divorced Amie, the sister of Ranald Macßuari,
and, by collusion with the Steward, had altered the succession to the
Lordship of the Isles in favour of the children of the second marriage. 2
Of Donald’s connection with the island we have an interesting record
in the Gaelic charter granted by him, in 1408, to Brian Yicar M°Kay or
M'Gee. A full account of this document, the earliest Gaelic charter
extant, is given in the footnotes on pp, 16—19, and an exact reproduc-
tion accompanies the text. There is a peculiar interest in the vigorous
signature of the warrior chief, which is scarcely symbolic of the bar-
barism which was overthrown three years later- at the battle of Harlaw.
The first witness, John Macdonald, is probably the grantor’s brother,
the Tanister, not his nephew, as suggested by Mr. Cosmo Innes (p.
18, n.). He had received from Donald sixty merklands in Islay, and
had added, by his marriage with Marjory Bisset, the lands of the Glens
in Antrim ; and he assumed in 1400 the title of “ Lord of Dunivaig and
the Glens,” the familiar style of his more famous descendants of the
Clandonald South. He endeavoured, at the instigation of MacFinnon,
to increase his possessions at the expense of his brother, but he found
the Lord of the Isles too strong, and was compelled to seek his
pardon with picturesque ceremonial at his brother’s residence at Kil-
choman (p. 19, n.), Donald died in Islay in 1428, and the lordship
passed to his son Alexander, whose struggle with James I. is a familiar
passage in the national history. So, too, is that of Alexander’s son John,
fourth and last Lord of. the Isles, whose final forfeiture was accomplished
in 1493 (p. 25, n.). His intermediate pardon and restoration in 1476
(p. 19) was of little moment in the history of the island, for he had
to reckon with the unceasing dissension caused there by his illegiti-
mate son Angus, the “ bold and forward ” man who had taken an active
1 Gregory, p. 27 and footnote. 2 lb., pp. 29-30. See Genealogical Tables.


part in the insurrection of 1461. Angus’s wife, a daughter of Argyll,
lived in the island; and it was there that the Earl of Athole kid-
napped her young child Donald Dubh, and where the enraged Angus,
in turn, confined for a year the Earl and Countess, whom he had carried
off by force from the chapel of St. Bride (p. 22, n,). After the death of
Angus at Inverness in 1490, and of his father, the last Lord of the Isles,
in 1498, among the monks of Paisley, the history of the island centres
in the House of Isla proper. The Tanister lived on till 1427, when
he fell by the hand of a James Campbell, who had received a
commission from the King for his arrest. Thus early had
the Campbells and Macdonalds discovered how much they hated
each other; and the interference of Argyll in the misdoings of the
brawler Angus, referred to above, is an early hint of a subtle
policy which was ultimately to complete the ruin of the Macdonalds
in their island home. The House of Isla was continued in Sir Donald
Balloch, who played some part in the struggle of the Lord of the Isles
and Earl of Ross with the Crown; thereafter, in his son John, who died
young ; and again, in his grandson John, known as Cathenach, who was
in possession at the time of the forfeiture of the Lordship of the Isles.
This forfeiture changed the relationship of many of the western clans ;
and it is in this, as well as in the hot-headed rebellion of Sir John which it
inspired, that we find the explanation of the long list of charters and
documents dealing with the island at this period (p. 24 et seq.). Sir John
was in favour at Court, but King James’s determination to retain the castle
of Dunaverty so enraged him that he defiantly forced the keep and hung
the body of the governor over the walls in sight of the King’s ships.
By the advice of Argyll, Maclan of Ardnamurchan was chosen to
avenge the insult. He captured Sir John and his sons John, John Oig,
and Donald in their island dwelling at Finlagan and hurried them off
to Edinburgh, where they suffered on the Boroughmuir. Alaster and
Angus Reach, his remaining sons, fled to the Glens in Ireland, and seem
to have remained in hiding till after the battle of Flodden, though


tradition holds that Alaster was reconciled, and assisted his father’s
captor in the slaughter of Sir Alexander of Lochalsh. 1 This Maclan,
who had been at feud with his kinsman Sir John Cathenach concerning
the lands of Sunart, received from the Crown, in 1494, a charter of
certain lands in Islay which he had formerly held of the Lord of the
Isles (pp. 24—5). He was rewarded for his speedy overthrow of Sir
John and his renunciation of certain rights in Kin tyre with the exten-
sive lands detailed in the Crown charter on pp. 28—30, —the preamble of
which gives an account of his services in Islay,—and also in the ratification
in 1505 printed on p. 31. In the following year he received the addition
of the lands of Balletarsin, Termachagan, and Proag (p. 32). The
small estate of Torlissay, which had been held by Hector Maclean of
Duart, was regranted by the Crown in 1496 to Lauchlan Maclean, his
natural son. Hector himself had an interest in the island, for in March
1517 he received a general acquittance for the ferms with which he had
made intromission since the death of James IV, (p. 35); and he was
looking forward to a more intimate connection with the Macdonald
patrimony. Argyll, of course, came forward in the interest of law and
order. He was “ bot ane puyr baron of the realm,” and “ sen the feild
“ of Floudon ” had been at great expense in defending the King’s
lands against the troublous men of the Isles (p. 33, n.). He sought to be
made lieutenant, and the Lords of Council empowered him during three
years to “ cans God and Haly Kirk be obeyit within the saidis landis,
“ our Soverane ansuerit according to his rentale, and justice ministrat.”
Remissions were to be granted, except to Donald of the Isles {i.e.,
Donald Dubh) and to the Clandonald. If the sons of the executed
chief of Islay would give good pledges, the Lord Governor was “ for pitie
“ to gif to thaim sum support,” such as had been given by the King’s
Grace to Angus of the Isles, otherwise the Lieutenant was to proceed
with all rigour (p, 35). In 1519 Argyll secured the ward and relief
of John Maclan, then deceased, including among other things the bailiary
1 Gregory, p. 108,


of his lands and the keeping of the castle of Dunivaig(p. 35, n.), and, in
May of the following year, he strengthened his hold on the island by
a bond of gossipry which the fugitive Alaster or Alexander made
with Argyll’s relative Sir John Campbell of Calder before a dispro-
portionate number of Campbell witnesses (pp. 35-7). Sir John obtained
the service of Macdonald and “ all the brance of the Clandonyll ”
for five years for the grant of forty-five merklands in Islay, besides
other favours in Colonsay and Jura. Alaster was to give security
that none of the Clanlan, or others dependent on Sir John, should be
troubled by him. Calder thus steps rather suddenly into the politics of
the island ; and he strengthened his footing by another bond made about
the same time with Maclean of Duart. After the five years had elapsed
the Council passed an Act, in 1528, that no infeftments were to be made
by the Islesmen without the consent of the Council and of Argyll, which
so irritated the Clandonald of Islay and the Clanlean of Duart that they
threatened a united rebellion. This meant, of course, the intervention
of Argyll and his henchman Calder, A mission having failed, orders
were given, on 6th September 1529, for the pursuit of Alaster (p, 38);
but before the Lieutenant had his levies ready the Islesmen made
voluntary surrender. Colin, Earl of Argyll, died in 1530, and his
son Archibald succeeded to his official honours and to the maintenance
of the traditional family policy of “the danting of the His” (see
his offers for the reduction of the South Isles, pp. 39—40). Alaster,
however, sent in his submission to the Council, which was accepted
on certain conditions specified in an Act of Council of 7th June
1531 (pp. 40—1). This reconciliation pleased ill the ardent Lord of
Argyll, who proceeded to prefer a bill of complaint against the island
chief for “ sindry great faltis ” done to him and his friends. Alexander
presented a vigorous reply to the charges, and concluded his defence as
follows :—“ And, gif the Kingis Graice, my Soverane Lord and Maister,
“ will gif power or command to me or ony uther gentilman of the His
“ that his Hienes will gif credence to rais the men of the His to cum to


“ his Hienes to pas in England in oisting or ony uther pairte in the
“ maynland within this realme, I sail mak gude we sail bring mair gude
“ fechtand men to do his Grace honour, plesour, and service na the said
“ Erll sail do. And, gif the said Erie will contempne the Kingis
“ Graces auctorite, his Hienes gevand command to me and his pouer
“ liegis of the Ilis, we sail caus and compell the said Erie to dwell in
“ ane uthir parte of Scotland nor in Ergile, cjuhair the Kingis Grace
“ may gett ressoun of him. And, further, thair is na persoun in the
“ Ilis that hes offendit to the said Erie or ony utheris in the Lawland
“ hot I sail caus him cum to the Kingis Grace to underly his lawis and
“ to pleis his Hienes and the pairty be ressoun, siclike as utheris Law-
“ land men dois, the brokynes and heirschip of the Ilis being considerit
“ maid be the said Erlis fader, the Knycht of Caldour, and Gillespy
“ Bane, his brother ” (p. 43). This was especially galling to Argyll,
but it was worse to be summoned to Court by King James and, after
some irritating enquiry, to be committed to prison. Perhaps worse still,
that at his liberation, shortly thereafter, he should be deprived of his
offices in the Isles, and that in some of these Alaster should be his
successor (p. 41, n.). Matters had indeed taken a turn when James Y.
sent gifts of good English bows to the quondam rebel and his son Angus
(p. 43, n.).
The story of the island from this time on till 1563 is uneventful. In
the autumn of 1558 the English Lord Sussex hovered round the coast
with hostile intent, but the stormy seas which had saved the island
before, and would cause English mariners serious trouble at a later and
more memorable expedition, defeated the purpose of the English Queen
(pp. 66—7). In July 1535 Allan Maclean, brother of Duart, received
the nonentry of the five merkland of Knockranisale &c. (p. 45); in
January of the following year Hector, younger of Duart, had a charter of
Torlissay (p. 46, ante p. xxxvi.), and in 1542 was infefted in the Islay
lands named in the charter on pp. 48—9 (see also the documents on pp.
53—58). The Maclean interest thus grew, till in 1563 it showed itself


in first distinct antagonism to that of the house of Dunivaig. Mary had
in 1545 given a charter to James Macdonald of Dunivaig of a consider-
able number of lands in Islay, which with others in Kintyre and
Colonsay formed the Barony of Bar (pp. 50—3), and she added, in 1554,
the foresaid lands of Knockranisale &c. (p. 59), which had been held by
Mac Neill of Gigha until his resignation in favour of the Lord of Dunivaig
(pp. 54, n., 59, n.). Again, in 1558, a charter by Francis and Mary re-
granted to Macdonald the Islay lands of the Barony of Bar, with the
addition of Kilcalumkill, for his worthy services against the English
forces in the "West Isles and in the North of Ireland (p. 62); and
further favours were conferred in 1562 and 1563 by the tack of additional
lands detailed in the documents on pp, 67—70. Thus re-established in the
ancestral estates, Macdonald turned his attention to the intrusion of the
Macleans. We have the first indication of what was to prove the bitterest
of clan feuds in the order of the Privy Council for an examination of the
writs of the two families regarding the possession of the Rinns (p, 70).
In the vicissitudes of Islay lordship many a legal document had come to
grief. The preambles of the charters of 1542 and 1558 bemoan their
wholesale destruction (pp. 49, 62). Macdonald relied, however, on
the proof of witnesses, and, as Maclean did not appear, found it easy
to persuade the Council that his claim was just (p. 72). This was
not to be the ending of the matter; but it took twenty-two years
before the quarrel was complete. After the date of the decision
of the Council there are two documents in favour of the Macdonalds,
the one a charter of novodamus to Archibald, son of James Mac-
donald (p. 7 2), and the other a letter of tack, including the castle of
Lochgorm, to James and his wife, Agnes Campbell (p. 73). Towards
the close of 1565 James Macdonald was slain in conflict with Shane
O’Neill in the north of Ireland, whither he had gone on account
of his family connection with the Glens, 1 His brother, Sorley Buy,
who narrowly escaped destruction at the same time, was kept captive
1 Gregory, p. 199 et seg.


for a while, but signalised his liberation by seizing the Irish estates, of
which he had the charge during his brother’s lifetime, and to which Angus,
James’s younger son, should have succeeded with the Islay patrimony.
Angus inherited the grudge against the Macleans: the relief by
his kind uncle from the cares of Irish chieftainship made each Islay
acre the dearer. In 1578 he and his friends, “ with certane forayne
“ ennymeis of Irland,” who were, according to the story of Maclean of
Duart, stirred up by Colin, Earl of Argyll, committed some serious
oppressions upon Maclean’s lands in Islay; and in December of that
year, with the aid of two hundred men sent by the Earl, he invested
the castle of Lochgorm (p. 74), probably with the intention of forcing
the renewal of the expiring tack, which, as we have seen, had been
given to his father fifteen years before. The Privy Council again
interfered and ordered both parties to keep the peace during the
investigation into the causes of controversy (pp. 74—5). The Earl,
doubtless, had had more to do with this diversion in the north of the
island than the young Angus, who, curiously enough, about this time
married Maclean’s sister (pp. 74, n., 79). Perhaps John, Bishop of the
Isles, had not the same confidence in the influence of the Privy Council
or of the young bride, for in June and December 1580 he made sepa-
rate contracts with Macdonald and Maclean (pp. 75-8). “ Quhow
“ sone the said reuerend father,” runs Macdonald’s bond, “ chansis
“he way of law to comprys ony landis or heretageis pertening
“ to Lauchlane M c Clayne of Doward within the boundis of Hay or
“ Kyntir, we sail delywer to the said reuerend father thankfull payment
“ of the sowmes . . . and tak of him ane just infeftment of the
“ saidis landis, as men of law can devyse ” : in the other, Maclean, just
as Macdonald, is to support the bishop in his rights, and in especial
in his possession of Ballifoill and the grange of Kilmeny in Islay. The
Bishop’s will tells the sequel to these overtures with the laird of Duart
(p. 77, n.), A renewal to Angus of the tack, including the castle of
Lochgorm (p. 78), hastened on the crisis, and in April 1585 the Privy


Council found it necessary to interfere once more and to order
the lieges of at least three shires to assist Angus in the “ pretendit
quarrelis movid agains him he his nychbouris ” (ib.), and at the same
time to summon Maclean of Duart to Edinburgh (p. 79, n.).
An untoward incident, probably early in 1586, set the clans by the
ears. Donald Gorm of Sleat had set out to visit his kinsman Angus,
and was driven by stress of weather on the island of Jura, which, like
Islay, acknowledged the double lordship of the Macdonalds and Macleans.
Their landing on Maclean territory might not have been misconstrued, had
not two renegades, who had, a quarrel with Gorm, made a sudden night
raid on Maclean’s cattle, in the hope that the Clanlean might think that
the visitors had come with hostile intent. Their design succeeded, and
the infuriated Lauchlan swooped down on the Macdonalds by night and
slew nearly threescore of them. Angus no sooner heard of this mis-
adventure than he hurried off to Skye to endeavour to appease the
insulted Donald, who had himself escaped with difficulty, and to force
Lauchlan Maclean to be reconciled. He returned by the island of Mull,
and, against the advice of friends, proceeded to the Castle of Duart.
Sir Lauchlan was in no hospitable mood and kept him prisoner till he
promised to renounce his title to the Einns of Islay. The gloomy
prospect of detention in Duart compelled Angus to accept the disgrace-
ful terms, which included the delivery of his son James and his brother
Ranald as pledges. Angus returned to Islay thirsting for revenge,
but resolved to set about the compassing of it by policy, rather than
by an appeal to arms which would hazard the lives of his heir and his
brother. Ere long Maclean arrived in Islay to obtain possession of the
coveted Einns : Eanald had been left in fetters at Duart, but the young
James accompanied him. He took up his abode at the ruinous castle of
Lochgorm, which his clan had seen in better days, but Angus pressed
him to come to his house at Mullintrea, where greater comfort and
better fare were to be had. The suspicious Maclean at first refused,
but after a time yielded to repeated invitations, which were full of


brotherly love and promises of carousal (p. 82). He arrived at Mulliu-
trea on a day in July 1586 with his nephew James and a following of
eighty-six clansmen. Courtesies passed, and the chiefs “ banquetted all
that day.” At night Maclean retired with his pledge and his men to
a long house at some distance from the village. Angus had mean-
while made arrangements for the gathering of his friends at nine
o’clock, and, when all was ready, placed a guard of three or four hun-
dred round his guest’s lodging. Angus himself called upon Maclean
at the door, offering him his “ reposing drink,” which “ wes forgottin to
“ be given him befor he went to bed ” ; but Maclean replied that he
did not wish it at that time. “ Although,” said Angus, “it be so, yit
“it is my will that thou aryse to come furth to receive it.” Maclean
saw resistance impossible and came forth with his young nephew
“ between his shoulders ”as a measure of protection. On the child’s
entreaty Angus stayed his sword and ordered the chief to be removed to
a secret chamber. The lives of the other clansmen were saved, but two
who refused to leave the house were burnt to death. One of these was
Macdonald Terreagh, one of the miscreants who had begun the troubles
on the shore of Jura. As soon as news of this disaster had reached
Duart, Allan Maclean sent a false rumour to Islay that Angus’s brother
had been executed, the subtle object of the lie being to enrage Angus
against Sir Lauchlan and so clear the way for his succession at Duart.
The trick wellnigh succeeded, for the Macleans in Islay were systematically
beheaded in couples, but Sir Lauchlan, partly by the intervention of the
Privy Council, was ultimately released, in return for the delivery of
Ranald Macdonald and certain Maclean pledges (pp. 84, 86—7).
According to Sir Robert Gordon’s account, Angus went thereafter
on a visit to the Clandonald of Ireland, and Maclean invaded the
island, burned far and wide, and pursued the Macdonalds who had
assisted at his disgrace. Macdonald returned from Ireland, and
“ ranged ” through the Maclean estates in Tiree and Mull, while Sir
Lauchlan proceeded to the Macdonald lands in Kintyre, and vied


with his foe in slaughter and pillage. The Account of the Clan
Maclean makes no mention of Macdonald’s absence in Ireland, and,
with obvious exaggeration, tells how Sir Lauchlan slew “ all the men
“ capable of bearing arms belonging to the Clandonald in Islay, drove
“ Angus within his castle of Dunivaig, and departed only on obtaining
“ a gift of one-half of Isla ” (p. 85, n.). A different complexion is put
upon the story in the Act of Council of 16th April 1587 (pp. 86-7).
There Macdonald seems to have obtained the upper hand so effectively
that the Crown felt constrained to order the release of his prisoners, and
to command peace till the matters in dispute were again investigated.
The charter to Hector Maclean, younger of Duart, of the lands of
Skerrols &c., formerly part of the Abbeylands of lona, and of the de-
tached tenement of Nerrabols, formerly held by the monastery of Derry
(pp. 88-93), does not imply any special favour to his family, for they
had been held by his grandfather Hector of the Commendators of lona
and Derry. A few days later a full remission was granted to Angus
Macdonald and his kin for their violence towards the Macleans, and
another to the Macleans for their part in the troubles; and both
chiefs, on the strength of these pardons, repaired to Edinburgh.
Maclean was at once indicted for his harrying in Islay and Gigha,
but he surrendered unconditionally to the King’s will; and Angus,
who was similarly charged, was wise enough to do the same. After
a brief incarceration in the Castle. of Edinburgh and the infliction
of a fine they were set at liberty (pp. 85, 95). One of the conditions
imposed upon them was their personal appearance on a certain day,—a
pet method of discipline of James VI, in his increasing difficulties in the
Highlands and Isles. The King was chiefly concerned about his rent, in
the payment of which the chiefs had shown an irritating remissness.
An Act of Parliament on sth June 1592 (p. 96, n.) and an order of the
Privy Council three days later (pp. 96—7) were passed by way of
reminder, but the Islesmen, distracted by the troubles in Ireland, showed
little heed. James Macdonald, w T ho had been detained in Edinburgh


since his father’s visit, was sent, in 1596, to urge Angus to give his
obedience (p. 97, n.). In May a proclamation was issued to the fencibles
in the West to prepare for an expedition. This had the desired effect
on Maclean; but, as Angus still held out, Sir William Stewart was
appointed Lieutenant, and preparations were hurried on for a campaign.
The levies were on their way and Sir William had probably reached
Islay (p. 98, n.) when James Macdonald arrived in Edinburgh with
a letter from his father containing his submission and a surrender of
his lands in favour of his said son (pp. 98—9). The Council showed
scant respect to his proposals and declared the King’s will to be
that James should remain at Court, that Angus should remove from
Kintyre and Gigha, that he should keep good order in Islay, Colonsay,
and Jura, and that before Christmas day he should appear with his
eldest son, or his natural son Archibald, or should deliver up the castle
of Dunivaig to the Lieutenant. Which being done, his Majesty
“ sail declare his perfyte and haill will anent the haill landis pre-
“ sentlie possest be the said Angus or his kin and freindis, how
“ mekle they sail retene of the same, and upoun quhat conditionis ”
(p. 100).
For the issue of these negotiations we must pass to the meeting of
the Privy Council, described in a letter of John Skene (pp. 103—105). It
appears that Angus’s kinsman, James Macdonnell (MaeSorley) of Dun-
luce, the head of the Clandonald South in Ireland, had been urged
by King James to assist his Lieutenant, and had been promised high
reward (p. 101, n.). Whereupon the said James wrote a long letter
to his Majesty hinting that a gift of the Scottish estates of Angus
would be most acceptable, and showing, after his own way, that he
had the best right to them (pp. 101—2, 104). He created a good
impression in Edinburgh, chiefly, according to Skene, because he was
“ verey temperat of his mouth,” but James wisely refused his petition,
though he resolved to show him some favour. Gossip had it that
he was to have Inchgarvie in the Firth of Forth, for the quaint


reason that “it is ane ile within the sey,” and the next best thing to
Islay. Argyll, too, was in Edinburgh, watching the course of events.
As it was his interest to oppose Dunluce, he gave his support
to Angus, already at feud with his Irish cousin (p. 98, n.). His kins-
man Calder had strengthened his connection with the island by signing
a bond of friendship with Angus in 1591—2, and he had bought the
neighbouring island of Gigha from Angus in 1590 (p. 97, n.). The
disinterestedness of this friendship for the lord of Dunivaig was to be
made clear ere long. Lastly, there was Angus himself, who, after
attending the Lieutenant’s court in Kintyre, had come to Edinburgh in
1597 to learn definitely the terms on which he was to make his peace
with the Crown. From the draft on pp. 102—3, and the letter on
p. 104, we learn the conditions. As he had not paid any rent since
his liberation from Edinburgh Castle, the Council refused to make a
particular declaration of the King’s will until he found caution for
these debts, removed from Kintyre as well as from the Rinns of
Islay now set in tack to Maclean of Duart, delivered up the castle
of Dunivaig before the 20th of May, and sent his second son
Angus as a pledge for the fulfilment of these conditions. Angus,
in short, was to confine himself to the south and south-west of
the island, and to leave the coveted portion of the Rinns to his old
enemy, Sir Lauchlan Maclean. After signing this document, Angus
departed for Islay early in 1597 in no amiable mood. Once in Islay,
he took no thought of his promises, till his son James arrived from
Edinburgh to persuade him to make them good.
James Macdonald’s errand of peace was rudely interrupted. Family
troubles had arisen among the Macalasters of Loupe, and the kinsmen
of Islay were drawn into the dispute. Angus and James took opposite
sides, and the latter attacked and set fire to the paternal house of
Askomull in Kintyre, to the sore peril of Angus, whom he took prisoner,
and so conducted himself that the Council were compelled to call out
the fencibles. Meanwhile the feud with the Macleans had broken out
9


again, for Maclean, not satisfied with the recovery of the Rinns, had
planned designs on the rest of the island. His arrival on Nave Island
in the north and his landing in Islay with a force of 260 fighting men,
for the ostensible purpose of possessing himself of the Rinns, drew Sir
James from Kintyre to the island, where he made a hurried levy. Mac-
lean, it seems, had been instigated by James MacSorley to overthrow the
kinsman whose lands he had himself coveted (p. 106, n.). Overtures
were attempted, Sir James offering half the island on the old tenure of
personal service to the Clandonald, According to the Account of the
Clan Maclean, each family was determined to possess a piece of ground
near Portaskaig, which was useful as a landing-place ( ib .). Maclean
would not yield and marched against the Macdonalds. A desperate
fight took place on sth August (1598) at the head of Loch Gruinart;
both clans lost heavily and Maclean was slain (p. 107). The treachery
at Duart had been avenged, and by the sword of the nephew whose
young intercession had stayed the Macdonalds’ anger at the long
house by Mullintrea. Sir James had not, however, seen the last of the
Macleans, for the young chief, Hector Oig, accompanied by Lochiel and
others, attacked him at Benbigrie or Ben Bige and forced him into
Kintyre. For three days the island was ravaged by the Macleans
(p. 107, n.).
These proceedings must have appeared peculiarly odious to James
VI., whose reputation as a peacemaker among nations must yield to
his greater fame, acknowledged by his contemporaries but unknown to
us till lately, as a disciplinarian of quarrelsome families or unruly clans.
His endeavours to procure obedience in Islay had been abortive ; expedi-
tions had been cancelled or had failed to find an active enemy, and the
Lords of Dunivaig had promised much, but had forgotten their obliga-
tions too soon. He had reason to be exasperated with the islanders :
they, on the other hand, had reason to say that their restlessness was
not entirely the result of an innate love of brawling. We have seen
how the Argyll and Calder interests had affected events in the island.


Within a year after the fight at Gruinart Sir James appeared at Court
with certain proposals for the future peace of the island (pp. 111—12),
which, unlike previous overtures, were referred by the Council to the
Comptroller for his opinion. Yet we hear nothing of the completion
of this promising arrangement. The next document, dated 16th June
1601 (pp. 111—4), is a lengthy commission to the Duke of Lennox
to establish order among the Islesmen, who “ delytis in nothing els bot
“in blud, thift, reif, and oppressioun.” What caused this sudden turn
we cannot state with certainty, but we may make a guess which, in the
light of subsequent events, is perhaps as near the truth as historical infer-
ence can be. It seems probable that it was brought about by the in-
fluence of Argyll and Calder, who worked together so to stir up dissensions
among the Macdonalds that King James, heartily sick of the whole business,
might be disposed to grant the island to their more loyal keeping.
In the proposals submitted to the King in 1599 Sir James was to
take over the lordship of Dunivaig and was to give his aged father
a competent liferent. It would not be difficult for Argyll to rouse the
old chief against this arrangement, even if the attack on Askomull
had been forgiven. Calder, on the other hand, perhaps ostensibly
in virtue of his band of friendship, prompted Sir James to pursue
his course, and was doubtless aided to this end by his sister Margaret,
now the wife of the young Lord of Dunivaig. The diminished
popularity which Angus enjoyed after his liberation by his son (p.
448) and the bitter memories of his treatment made it easy for
him to believe a report circulated in 1603 that the impetuous Sir
James was plotting against him. Accordingly he set about to have
him apprehended and, when he succeeded, had him sent by Campbell
of Auchinbreck to the safer keeping of Argyll. 2 The Council were
no sooner informed of the arrest of the young chief than they
ordered him to be brought before them at Perth in 1604. From
Perth he was passed on to Blackness Castle, and shortly thereafter,

because of an endeavour to escape, was removed to the Castle of
Edinburgh.
Angus had now to be dealt with. The series of documents from
p. 115 onwards show how this was done ; first, a letter to him and Mac-
lean of Duart, dated 20th September 1603, to deliver up their fortalices to
the Earl of Argyll, to whom were given “ some speciall directionis anent
“ the materis of the lies” (p. 115, n.); secondly, a commission to the
Earl, on 20th October following, to pursue the rebel Macdonalds and others;
thirdly, in July 1604, an Act requiring the King’s tenants in Islay to
find caution for their rent; fourthly, on 13th June 1605, an order to
Angus, his son Angus Oig, and others to appear personally and to exhibit
their charters and writs ( ih .); and fifthly, on 27th June following, a
specific order for the delivery of Dunivaig to Robert Hepburn, Lieutenant
of the Guard. That month the west country levies were ordered to
meet at Loch Kilkerran on 25th July, and in August a commission was
granted to Lord Scone. At a court held by him in Kintyre, Angus
appeared and paid his arrears of rent and gave as a pledge his natural
son Archibald, to whom the barony of Gigha had been granted in March
1599 (pp. 108—9). Angus backed up his payment of arrears by an act
of caution (10th February 1606) for the maintenance of a royal garrison
in Dunivaig and for their peaceable possession of the same (pp. 116-8);
and on Bth September added yet another to the list of proposals which
the Crown had received from its troublesome vassals in Islay (pp. 118—9).
He was moderate in his demands; with pardonable pride he referred to
the fact that he had paid all his dues ; he was willing to “ set forwart
“ and assist sic reformation of the barbarite of thir cuntreis ... as it
“ sail pleas his Hines best to dewyse.” 1 Two days later he addressed a
letter to the King, now in England, complaining that he had not received
an answer to the proposals sent in June 1605 and had been refused
licence to appear before his Majesty, and adding these words, —“ beseiking
“ your Majestic for the cause of God to respect my aige and puir estait,
1 The old man’s signature is reproduced on p. 119.


“ and to lat me knaw your Hienes awin mynd, signit with your Majesteis
“ awin hand.” It must have been about this time that the undated peti-
tion from the tenants of Islay, printed on pp. 450—1, was sent up in favour
of the aged Macdonald and his son Sir James. It may have been drawn
up at the instigation of the old man ; at all events, its tone argues that
the Macdonalds and their friends had begun to take seriously the prospects
of exile.
This testimonial was not likely to weigh much with the Council. They
had had no small trouble with the Macgregors, and in their anger saw
little distinction between “ that infamous byke of lawless limmers ” and
other self-willed Highlanders or Islesmen. Sir James Macdonald had
endeavoured in 1606 to escape from Edinburgh Castle, and Archibald
of Gigha, referred to above, had made good his escape from Dumbarton
in March 1607 (p. 121, n.). When, therefore, Argyll made, about this
time, his claim for reward for services against the Clangregor, and requested
a gift of the lands of Kintyre, he knew he was not asking the impossible.
The Council record that they had been unable to come to any certain
conclusion with Angus and his son ( ib .), and proceed, after a denun-
ciation of the Clandonald as the “ strangest piller of all the broken
“ Hieland men, quha nevir in any aige wer civill, bot hes bein the
“ scoolemaisteris and fosteraris of all barbaritie, savaignes, and crueltye ”
(p. 121), to approve of the gift of Kintyre to the Earl. The infeftment
was passed on 30th May 1607 ; 1 and the Earl was very near having Islay
too (p. 122).
Sir James sent a humble letter to the King from Edinburgh Castle,
praying forgiveness for his attempted break of ward and promising
obedience; but it availed nothing, especially as a rumour came in July
that Angus and his friends had amassed considerable forces and a number
of galleys for an attack by sea and land (p. 122, n.). On 12th August
the Earl of Argyll received a commission of justiciary for six months
(p. 122, n.), but he was unable to do much, and Alexander Oig, then gover-
1 See the Register of the Privy Council, xi. p. 164, n.


nor of Dunivaig, bid defiance to his demand to surrender the castle, —for
which offence, however, the Council pardoned him soon thereafter (p. 129).
Another attempted escape by the restless Sir James in December roused
the Council to greater activity. Andrew, Lord Stewart of Ochiltree, and
Andrew, Bishop of the Isles, Were empowered, on Bth March 1608, to
confer with Angus Macdonald and Hector Maclean anent their obedience.
On the 10th, orders were given for the meeting of the western fencibles
at Islay on Ist June, afterwards postponed till Ist July (p. 123, n.),
and on 14th April a commission was issued to the Bishop, Lord Ochiltree,
and the Comptroller to report before the 20th of May the Islesmen’s
answers to certain queries. Their demands, printed on pp. 123-4, n.,
are more exacting, and are a foretaste of the new Crown policy in the
Isles, to be ultimately formulated in 1610 in the Statutes of Icolmkill.
After some squabbling as to the chief command, Ochiltree set out and,
having been delayed for a time at Ayr, arrived on 2nd August near
Dunivaig, in the road of Island Texa. His force consisted of about 900
men, with two English ships and a pinnace and two Scots ships and ten
barks (p. 131). The narrative of his dealings with Angus Macdonald and
Hector Maclean will be found in the letters, reports, and footnotes on
pp. 130-7. With the aid of the Bishop he secured the obedience of
Angus and his friends, who handed over the castle of Dunivaig to a
garrison consisting of a captain and twenty-four soldiers. Maclean also
surrendered, and the castle of Lochgorm was destroyed by the Commis-
sioner, Courts were held in the island, but small discipline had to be done
beyond the imprisonment of some Irish rebels who had been lurking
there. Ochiltree then proceeded to Mull to secure the complete obedience
of Maclean at his chief castle. Thither a number of the Islesmen repaired
to hear the King’s will. As they did not show themselves as ready to
surrender their castles as Angus had been, the Lieutenant had to rely on
the persuasive power of the Bishop. He invited them to a sermon on
board the Moon, and afterwards to dinner. “In end,” we are told, “he
“ sayis to thame that thay must stay, becaus the same wes his Majesteis
“ will ; and, taking up saill, bringis thame with him.” How strikingly like


the ruse of the Northmen in Islay-Sound in 1230, but with the added
romance of the good Bishop’s sermon! That the story is no mere fig-
ment, and that the Bishop was somewhat conscience-stricken by his con-
duct, is proved by the rambling letters which he wrote to the King
immediately thereafter (pp. 133-6, 134, n.). Angus Macdonald had
been allowed his liberty, but the goodly company who had been caught
on the Moon were brought to Edinburgh in October 1608 (p. 136).
The Council had now their opportunity for legislation: Sir James
Macdonald in the Castle of Edinburgh, and Hector Maclean of Duart,
Donald Gorm of Sleat, the Captain of the Clanranald, and others in Black-
ness, Dumbarton, or Edinburgh. So a commission was appointed, that the
work, “ hithertillis so endles,” might be brought to a conclusion. They
had frequent conferences with the captives : see the offers made by the
Laird of Duart, in which he undertook to keep rule in his Islay
lands, provided that the King made the remaining lands of Islay
answerable (p. 138). Old Angus could not keep away; indeed,
Lord Ochiltree was ordered to present him, his sons Alaster and Ronald,
and Coll Macgillespic, in order that the Commissioners might improve
the opportunity of obtaining their capitulation (p. 137, n.). Angus
wished to be sent back, as he alleged he had not the means to live
in Edinburgh, but, after a second interview on 12th May, he was sent in
safekeeping to Blackness Castle. On the next day the crowning act in
the policy of awing the Islesmen took place in the trial of the notorious
Sir James Macdonald for past offences and attempted break of ward. A
brief account of that trial will be found in the footnote of pp. 138-9.
Sir James was found guilty, partly through the evidence of Argyll, and
was sentenced to death. For some mysterious reason of State, perhaps
for that elaborated in the History of the Western Islands, 1 his life was
saved, and he was yet to “drink” many a pipe of tobacco with the
Castle warders.
After an interview with the King, and a readjustment of arrangements
on his return to Edinburgh, the Bishop of the Isles set out for the West
1 Page 328.


to make a survey and to introduce a respectable polity among the evil-
doers. Angus Macdonald and Hector Maclean accompanied his Lordship,
the former closely bound by promises of hearty concurrence, backed up
by heavy caution from Argyll and Ochiltree. The Bishop was successful
in his negotiations, and the famous Band and Statutes of Icolmkill was
signed by the peace-loving chieftains. Macdonald agreed to reduce his
household to six gentlemen, and Maclean, who, however, dwelt chiefly
in Mull, to eight. The warrant to the Comptroller to pay for ten marts
and to send £2OO in silver to the garrison at Dunivaig (p. 143) shows
that the King had at last overcome opposition in the island. Nay, he
could afford to be generous, and Angus’s date of appearance in Edin-
burgh was extended, and a recent Act against trade with the island
rescinded with much protestation, in order to make it easier for the chief
to pay his rental to the Exchequer (p. 144, n; see also p. 147, n.). The
Bishop, as an acknowledgment of his fitness to administer the West,
was appointed Steward of the North and South Isles, and was granted
a liferent of the Castle of Dunivaig, which he was to make the centre of
his movements (pp. 144-7). Lord Ochiltree handed over the castle to
the Bishop in August 1610, and the island lapsed into a peace consistent
with the episcopal presence.
Between July 1610 and New-Year’s day 1612 there is nothing on
record but another of those dutiful visits of Angus and his neighbours to
the Privy Council at Edinburgh ; but on the latter date, after having been
at least a month in the capital, he signed a renunciation of his lands in
Islay in favour of Campbell of Calder, for the sum of six thousand merks
(pp. 148-9). The intimation comes rather suddenly, and at a time when
Angus was on his best behaviour. His years may have been telling on
him, and the anxious Campbells may have been importunate. Sir James,
still a prisoner in Edinburgh Castle, heard the news with dismay, and
did not hide his feelings from Mr. John Bollock, a friend of Calder. “He
“ sayis,” writes Mr. John to the latter, “he man content him selff to ly
“ still as a puir prissoner and abyid all patientlie, and dar undertak
“ nothing for want of freindschip ; whiche, justlie or injustlie, he blames


“ your M. much that my lord Argyll sould haue tane your M. from his
“ cours, but your M. knavvis bayth for quhat occasioun ye do it. ... I
“ did declaire unto him that in respect he had bene dealing be uther
“ meanis nor your M. in his awin earand, that quhateuir did fall furth
“ hereftir concerning his landis or ony uther thing belonging unto him,
“ both he micht be frie off his promese maid to your M., and your M. of
“ all promese maid to him, Sa soone as he hard this he sayis, ‘ I blame
“ ‘ the Erll of Argyll as much as him self of that, but for his one sisteris
“ ‘ cause and hir barnes I wold he wold tak some dealing to ther well in
“ ‘that mater’” (p. 151). This conversation is important: it marks the
ending of the band of friendship between Calder and the Macdonalds, and
it is the first note, excepting the protest at the trial in 1609, of direct
accusation against the Earl of Argyll. Calder was not, however, to get
Islay so easily. A letter to him from his agent James Mowat, dated 11th
September 1612 (pp. 152-3), shows that a hitch had occurred, and that
Calder’s representatives had been compelled by the Lords to renounce his
tack in favour of Angus, by virtue of some backhand. The transaction took
place in St. Giles’s Kirk, in presence of Angus and Sir Ranald MacSorley.
This Sir Ranald, the younger brother of the well-mannered Sir James of
Dunluce, had impressed the Council as favourably as his brother when he
had come to Edinburgh to obtain the coveted island, but he met with better
success. Through the influence of the brother of Lord Abercorn he
obtained the tack, while Calder’s law-agents were delaying (pp. 152, 155).
Shortly after this the aged Angus died ; where and when we cannot say.
He left his lands in the hands of a brother of his hated cousin in Ireland,
and his son in prison under sentence of death. The Campbell had been
thwarted, but only the Sound lay between him and the richer lands of
Islay. The old man could not have foretold how fate would unravel the
tangled web.
Unfortunately the Irish laird made himself very unpopular within less
than six months, by exacting dues from the tenants for pasturing their
cattle on the waste lands of the island, by demanding quarterly pay-
ments from the honest weavers and shoemakers and twelve pence for
h


each cow received in marriage dowry, and by compelling the people to
have their actions settled according to the form and custom of Ireland.
They were sorely oppressed, too, by vagabonds and sorners, and therefore
demanded from the Council to be freed from the tyranny of “ foreyne and
“ strange lawis.” The Council at once proceeded to rectify this abuse, to
the satisfaction of the islanders, and in September, James Primrose,
Clerk of Council, remarks, in his jottings on the State of the Isles, that
“ sensyne thair hes bene nothing hard among thame ” (p. 155).
Seven months later the worthy Clerk of Council put on record the
distressing news that in March Dunivaig had been surprised by a
“ vagabound fellow,” Ranald Oig, a reputed son of the late Angus, and
four or five companions (pp. 156-7). They had climbed the outer wall
by ladders, had rushed in in the early morning at the opening of the
gates, and had expelled the Bishop’s brother and two or three servants who
were in charge. It was further reported that young Angus Macdonald,
brother of Sir James, having heard of this assault, had sent the fiery cross
throughout the island summoning the inhabitants to an attack on the
castle, and that Ranald had held out for six days, during which he had spent
all the Bishop’s store of powder and bullet, and had in end escaped from
a back-gate to a six-oared boat with much of the Bishop’s property. The
Council, who had received this information from Sir James, resolved to
postpone decision till they had heard from Argyll or the Bishop. Mean-
while they were in correspondence with the King about the cancelling of
Sir James’s sentence of forfeiture, as a preliminary to the consideration of
a petition for release, in which the prisoner promised to find caution not
to repair to Islay without royal permission (p. 157, n.). The mind of the
Council, however, soon changed. Their suspicions of Angus’s dutiful
professions had grown into the conviction that the whole affair had been
planned by him. Angus’s refusal to surrender to the Bishop was to
them proof of disloyalty, and his slaughter of Ranald’s men and his im-
prisonment of Ranald himself was construed into a precaution against the
discovery of his plot. Accordingly, the Bishop received commission to
regain the castle, by force if necessary (pp. 157-9). As Sir James had


given the first ■ hints of this, mysterious escapade, the Council natur-
ally doubted his disinterestedness. He was put in irons, and the
Captain of the Guard and the Clerk of Council received instructions to
“ rype ” his person and coffers. It might have gone hard with him had
any compromising papers been found ; but nothing was discovered except
two letters written that day to his mother and brother, in the latter of
which he counselled obedience and the surrender of the castle. After
further search they found a letter from Angus Oig, stating that he had
offered the castle to the Bishop’s brother, who had refused to take it off
his hands. The Council thereupon sent an order to Angus to deliver the
castle to the Bishop within six days, and to hand over Ranald MacAllaster
to him, that he might be brought to Edinburgh for punishment
(p. 160).
The Bishop set out for the West with remissions to Angus Oig and
others, on condition of the surrender of Dunivaig within twenty-four
hours (pp. 161-163); but he tarried so long by the way that Secretary
Binning was constrained, when urging greater activity, to “ mix ” one of his
letters “ with sum bitternes” (pp. 163-5, 165, n.), which had a wholesome
effect on his lordship, though he took an early opportunity of protesting
against it as “ ane verie byitiug lettre” (p. 169). He landed in Islay on
19th September, in the hope that the Lairds of Sleat and Ardincaple, whom
he had sent on before, had been able to mitigate the rebels’ humour (p. 170).
On the morning of the 21st he realised the hopelessness of his mission.
We may quote his own words :—“ Donald Gorme, comeing to me, gave
“ up commoning and utter refusell to delyver the house any maner of
“ way. And immediatlie aftir theme the greittest nomber of the name of
“ Clan Donald of that yle, 'both of the taikeris of that house and suche as

“ ing of bluid and greittare inconvenientis it behovit me to yeild and so
“ to chuse out of our company my nevoy, the laird of Eanfurlie, and my
“ sone Mr. Thomas, whome they have taikin with theme to the castell of
“ Dunavaig. Whairby,” adds the Bishop, “ your Lordshipis may perceave
“ how traitourouslie I have bein oft desaiffit be that pesteferous clan, how
“ hard my caice is many wayis, and in what trouble my freindis are cum
“in be my cair to serve the Kingis Majestie” (p. 171). The good
man had forgotten all about his sermon on the Moon. Full as the
letter is from which we have quoted, we do not get the whole story
of his misfortunes. What passed between him and the islanders is made
clear by the contract with Angus Oig and his friends printed on pp.
166-9. The condition imposed on the Bishop, and for the readier fulfil-
ment of which John Knox and Mr. Thomas Knox were taken as pledges,
was that he should get the King’s consent to—(l) a seven years’ tack of
the Crown lands in Islay (then possessed by Sir Eanald MacSorley of Dun-
luce) to Angus Oig Macdonald, for the yearly duty of eight thousand
merks ; (2) the delivery of Dunivaig and all the Bishop’s rights of the
same to the said Angus ; (3) a tack to the said Angus of all the Church-
lands, especially the twenty-five merkland formerly possessed by his father
Angus and now in the hands of Sir Eanald MacSorley ; (4) a seven years’
tack at the old rent to Eanald Mac James, Angus’s uncle, of the 17 merks
6s, Bd. land then in his possession; (5) a seven years’ tack to Coll
MacGillespic and the said Eanald of the Churchlands at present held
by them, and in especial the 16s. 8 A lands of Eadadell; and further, that
he should endeavour to obtain a remission under the great seal to Angus
Oig, Eanald Mac James, Coll MacGillespic, Sir Eanald MacSorley, and others
all their past crimes. The pledges were to be kept in safety in Dunivaig,


or in “ suclie utlicr places being competent for honest men to leive into.”
If the Bishop could not, after serious endeavour, procure these favours, he
might have back his pledges for such ransom as might be agreed upon;
and all expense incurred in obtaining tacks and remissions was to be repaid.
According to the verbal communication of Bryce Semple, an accredited,
messenger from the Bishop, the demands of the islanders had expanded
into a nineteen years’ tack of Islay for eight thousand merks, to be held
of the Bishop on good security (p. 174), Yerily a “ pestiferous ” people,
and a sad plight for the Steward of the Isles, North and South ! The
resolution shown by the islanders is remarkable: a postscript to the
Bishop’s letter tells us that they had backed up their action at Dunivaig
by building a fort in a loch, and had manned it and stored it with victuals
(p. 172). In the same postscript we have an explanation of the defiance
in the words of Angus Oig, said before many witnesses, “ that he gat
“ directione from the Erll of Argyle to keip still the house, and that he
“ suld procure him theirfoir the haill landis of Yley and house of Duna-
“ vage to himself.”
The Council were dismayed at this unexpected crisis. The King had
to be consulted post-haste, for to yield to the dictation of the rebels was
a dangerous precedent, on which his Majesty might be tempted to
make some vigorous remark. They told him at the same time that they
had conferred with the Laird of Calder about the suppression of the
rebellion and had asked him to undertake the business. He had
demurred at first, because his preference might gain him the grudge of
some powerful noblemen, and because the presence of the Bishop’s
pledges in Islay made the task exceedingly difficult; but he had yielded
to their proposition, on condition that his Majesty would furnish a few
cannon, two cannoneers, and other two men “ expert for battering of
“ houses.” He would call out his own men, but, if the campaign were
long drawn out, he would require additional assistance (pp. 174-5).
That Calder should have been summoned at this juncture is not surprising.
He had not been altogether in the background since the death of Angus
Macdonald. Before the end of June he had made an offer for the


island of 8000 merles yearly and a fine of £2OOO, and had sent in some
general proposals for the reduction of the Isles “to civilitie and profit ”
(p. 161). The Council were not sure that his offer, good as it was,
might not be increased, or that he was in thorough earnest. and Sir
Gideon Murray’s letter of 6th August shows that he had held back
because the Council proposed to deal only with Islay at that time (p.
162). The Council’s go-between, Archibald Campbell, who had moved
Calder to accept the feu of Islay, had persuaded him to come forward to
the aid of the Council in its difficulties (p. 172). It may here be noted
that Secretary Binning referred to Calder s offer as “ far abone any thing
“ that any responsall man of qualitie did evir offer” (p. 172). He may
■have had in mind the second proposal from Angus, also for 8000 merks.
The islander was, of course, not a responsible man, though his offer may
have induced some of the Council to hope that Calder would bid higher
(p. 161). Further, it seems probable that the second offer from Angus,
communicated by Bryce Semple, was due to hints of Calder’s activity
and of the sum which he was prepared to promise.
Calder’s intervention far from pleased Bishop Andrew, who was
sorely grieved about his son and nephew. He eased his mind to John
Murray of the Bedchamber in these significant words;
“ trubill that is done to me and [my] friendis is becaus of Archibauld
“ Cambellis diligence to procure the iyll of lyla to the Lard of Cadell, of
“ the wiche thai ar certanlie informit. The wiche, if it tak effect, will
“ breid grit trubill in the lylles, far moir nor all the fyn and dewete of
“ the lyles of Scotland will afford thir many yeiris, and in the meantym
“be the wrak of my freindis. Nather can I, or any man who knowes
“ the estait of that cuntre, think it ather good or profitabill to his
“ Majestie or this cuntrie to mak that nam gritter in the lyles nor thai
“ ar alleredie, nor yit to rut out one pestiferous clan and plant in one
“ lytill bettir” (p. 176). He would solve the problem by colonising
the island, as had been done in Ulster, with which there had always
been frequent intercourse. But, for the present, because it was difficult
to trust the islanders in any matter, he would advise a “ sycht of


“ forces ”as a sedative against rebellion. He gave bis plans in detail,
even the names of the captains. With 200 men he would effect his
purpose: or his Majesty might send a ship of war. Diplomacy was,
however, to crown the victory. “Albeit I must alwayes deall,” he
writes, “ for the releive out of thais vilanes handis of my narrest
“ freindis, yit I am nowayis obleist to do tham grit good, who hes
“ kyitht tham seifs to hawe nather feir of God, . . . nor yit fayth or
“ trewth to thair nychtbour ” (p. 177). This is an advance since
the merry day on the Moon. We hear of no troublings of conscience ;
but what will not a bishop do for his kin fallen among a deceitful people ?
King James’s letter to the Deputy of Ireland on 14th October warns us
that the turmoil had begun. He was ordered to send 200 soldiers under
an experienced commander, with such artillery as could be spared from
the Irish forts, with petards and all other necessaries to bombard Duni-
vaig, whose walls, his Majesty had been informed, were six and thirty feet
thick. Campbell of Calder was named as lieutenant, and the Deputy’s
forces were to be under his orders (pp, 177-9). Eight days later the
Council wrote to the Deputy to the same effect (pp, 182-3) and issued a
number of important orders (pp. 179-90), including instructions and a
commission of lieutenancy to the laird of Calder, a proclamation for
armed musters in the western mainland, an order to Angus Oig and his
accomplices to surrender the castle within six hours, a proclamation of
pardon to such inhabitants of the island .as were not concerned in the
capture of the castle and might have been forced to cast in their lot with
the rebellious Angus, and an order that all persons whose names might
be sent in writing to the Council by the Lieutenant should appear per-
sonally in Edinburgh. The importance of the expedition was well
impressed on the Lieutenant by the Council: all things were to be in
such excellent order that his Majesty’s English companies might have no
cause for unfavourable comment. The Lords at Edinburgh then, as
during the visit of the King to Scotland in 1617, were keenly jealous of
the honour of their country when strangers were about. The merchants
of Glasgow were to furnish “goode drinking heir, yf it may be haid,” or


in its stead “ good aill that will keepe well.” There was some point in
bidding the Lieutenant be careful that the islanders treated the strangers
respectfully, for English soldiery was a novelty on these shores. The
boatmen of the island were to cease from their trading and to keep all
their lumfads, scouts, and hidings at the disposal of the troops
(p. 186).
The Council was proceeding too hastily for the Bishop of the Isles.
On the morning after their long sederunt, he wrote another letter,
“frivolus” he modestly calls it, to John Murray, asking him to inquire
of his Majesty what part he was to take in the expedition. “ Being that
both Inglische and Scotische are to be thair,” he wrote, “ and that also, if
“it pleas God, I must be, what schalbe my credeit amangis tham?”
Having thus stated the danger threatening his authority from the ap-
pointment of Calder, he reverted to his homilies on the “ fals generation
“ and bludie pipill,” and repeated his intention to be their slave
for a time, though it was only to serve his own ends. He was still unre-
conciled to the intervention of the Laird of Calder, and inclosed a
petition by Sir James Macdonald from which he saw “ ane ware
“ ease way to satisfe his Majestic for the contempt and purge the
“land of that pipill” (pp. 192-3). Sir James’s offers had probably
been written early in the month, and may have been suggested by
rumours of what the Council intended to do at their meeting on the
22nd. The document, which is printed on pp. 191-2, may be here
epitomised. First, he requested a seven years’ tack at an annual rent of
8000 merks. Secondly, he offered, should the King decide to keep the
island in his own hands, to make it worth ten thousand merks yearly,
and, with the gift of one year’s rent, to depart with his kin and buy land
in Ireland or elsewhere. Meanwhile he would go with the Bishop to the
island to recover the castle and pledges without expense torhis Majesty,
or he would return to ward within forty days. If successful, he and
his brother were to have permission to go to Court and kiss hands. He
promised, moreover, to bring Ranald MacAllaster and Ranald Macdonald
Vallict to Edinburgh and to put Coll MacGillespic in irons. His young


son was to be left as a pledge, to die if Sir James should fail. Thirdly,
he offered, without any condition of land or money, to leave the country,
and with his Majesty’s permission to present himself for service to the
Estates of Holland. He would secure caution, to the amount of 5000
merks each, from a number of responsible men, including the Bishop,
the Earl of Tullibardine, Lord Burleigh, and even Campbell of Calder.
The Council were certainly anxious about the pledges, but they would
have none of the aid offered from Edinburgh Castle. A proclamation
was made on 26th October, declaring his Majesty’s commiseration for
the islanders, “ yf yitt in tyme thay will repent thame of their treasounable
“ and foolische proceidingis,” and promising pardon to any man who would
deliver one of the pledges in safety or a rebel of his own rank, and
even to Angus Oig himself, on condition of the surrender of the Castle,
the pledges, and two important rebels (p. 194). Meanwhile Chancellor
Dunfermline had resolved to send a private agent, one George Grahame,
who spoke Gaelic, to effect the liberation of the Bishop’s son and
nephew, Grahame’s warrant, as certified by the deluded Angus Oig and
Coll MacGillespic, is printed on pp. 195-6. The promises were so ample
that the islanders readily handed over the prisoners to Grahame, early in
November, and sent, too, the keys of Dunivaig. The Chancellor boasted
in a letter to John Murray of the way in which he had “ allured ” Angus
to surrender without committing the Council to any conditions. The
pledges were saved just in time, for Angus had threatened that, “gif
“ onye seige came from his Majestie to that hous, thay sould be sett ouir
“ the wals to kep the first shoittis ” (p. 234). More was to be heard of
this ruse when the islanders were examined in Edinburgh, and we can
leave discussion of it for the present.
Throughout November the military preparations progressed. The
Irish officials were sorely perplexed about the impregnable fortress against
which they were to send their artillery (p. 197). On 25th November
all was ready, a hoy with two cannons and a culverin of brass, —fair and
precious pieces, with which Sir Oliver St. John parted almost in tears
(p. 231, n.), smaller artillery on board two ships of war, and a bark with
i


provisions. The two hundred foot-soldiers were shipped at Carrickfergus
and Derry, Sir Oliver Lambert was placed in command, with Captains
Crawford, Parkins, and Button as under-officers (pp. 231, 236). The
übiquitous Archibald Campbell, who had brought news of Calder’s pre-
parations in order to hasten on the Irish companies, returned to Scotland
with Sir Oliver (p. 232). The Council at Edinburgh resolved to send a
petard to blow up the gates of Dunivaig, and instructed the Treasurer-
Depute to make trial of the engine on some gate in the Castle of
Edinburgh “ quhair most commodiouslie and with least dangeir the same
“ may be usit.” The experiment may at least have afforded a fresh
topic for Sir James and the Castle warders, when they smoked together
in the weary afternoons.
Just before the departure of the troops from Ireland, and while the
Scottish forces w r ere hastening towards Islay, a charter, under the
Great Seal, of the lands and island of Islay was granted at Newmarket
(21st November 1614) in favour of Sir John Campbell of Calder and his
heirs. The Laird had at last obtained his heart’s wish, perhaps as an
inducement for greater expedition against the “ broken men ” of the island,
more probably because he had advanced his offer to the sum of 9000
merks of annual rent. The lengthy document, with its interesting list
of Islay lands, is given in extenso on pp. 199-227 of this volume. A
precept of sasine was granted on the same day (p. 231). What Sir
James Macdonald thought of this we shall soon hear.
Sir Oliver Lambert arrived in Islay-Sound on 14th December 1614.
He was informed by the people of Jura that the Laird of Calder had
returned home after eight days’ delay in two waste islands off Islay
and had dispersed his men, and that the Castle of Dunivaig had been
surrendered to Grahame in the name of the Chancellor (p. 240). Never-
theless he resolved to carry out his instructions and despatched a
summons to surrender before giving the order to land (p. 236). Angus
Oig sent a reply on the same day, that, had he not already given
up the castle to the Chancellor and Council of Scotland, he would have
willingly obeyed him or any other holding his Majesty’s warrant. “If


“ ye doubt of this,” he added, “ send me your awin secretar, or anie
“ uther that can reid, and I shall let him sie my warrand frome the
“ Counsell desyring me to keip this castell wnto the tyme that his
“ Maiesties will wilbe declairit to me” (p. 237). Lambert, in a second
letter, expressed his doubt that he should have been sent on such a fool’s
errand (p. 237), but despatched Captain Parkins to examine the docu-
ment, and at the same time to take note of the strength of the
fortifications. The captain brought back the copy certified by Angus
Oig and Coll MacGillespic, referred to above, which Captain Lambert
would not believe to be the work of so grave a councillor as the Lord
Chancellor, neither in tenor nor in phraseology. During this parley word
came from the Laird of Calder that he was hurrying to Islay; and the
English forces awaited him for three weeks on the shore of Jura in cold
tempestuous weather, while Captain Button, on board his Majesty’s ship
the Phoenix , spent his time in a continual curse against broken cables and
drawn anchors. Calder arrived on sth January and arranged for an
assault on Dunivaig on the 9th, but he and Lambert had not reckoned
with the rough weather and the difficulty of landing cannon on such a rocky
coast. In Lambert’s long letter from the camp of Dunivaig, printed on
pp. 240-6, we have a detailed account of their troubles. On the 13th
the hoy was safely anchored in the road under Island Texa, and, on the
advice of the pilots, the Phoenix was brought round; but another storm,
which lasted for two days and a half, so buffeted Captain Button that
Lambert had to dismiss him to the. open. On the 23rd the Phoenix
found a haven and fair weather at the land-locked Leodamais to the west,
and Captain Button sent his long-boat and another to tow the hoy into a
creek for the purpose of landing the cannon. This spot had been found
with difficulty, and it was exposed to the fire of the castle. Till the 30th
the soldiers and mariners were busy unshipping their ordnance, timber,
and munition, and tugging them to their camp half a mile distant, —
Angus Oig all the while cheering them on with a generous cannonade,
which killed Captain Crawford and a Highlander and sorely wounded an
English soldier. During these tedious operations Eanald Mac James


Vic Donald sent in his submission to Calder, and in a band, dated at
Balnacbtan on 24th January, undertook to surrender the fortalice on the
island of Loch Gorm before the 28th (p. 239). The besieging party finished
their platform and completed their camp by the 31st, and on Ist February
opened fire on the gate-tower on the outer rampart facing the north. 1
The cannons were then directed against the high southern wall of the
building to the left of this entrance; a gap was made ere long, and the
castle port was exposed to the fire of the English musketeers. In the
after-part of the day the royal troops had forced the spikes and battle-
ments on the northern front with the intention of undermining the outer
rampart; but the rocky ground rendered this impossible, and Lambert
turned his cannon on the eastern side against the staircase and the wall
by the well. The operations were renewed early next morning, and the
wall soon fell down. Thereupon, about seven o’clock, the besieged sent
a boy with a letter requesting a parley, which was granted on condition
that Angus should come out to the camp. This, after some delay, he did.
He repeated the story of the Chancellor’s mission, “ with much other
“ idle stuffe and imaginations infused into them by Grymes (Grahame).”
He was told that nothing would be accepted but humble submission or the
delivery of Coll MacGillespic and some others for whom he desired remis-
sion ; but to no avail. “ Then wee questioned,” writes Lambert, “ whether
“he were of power to deliuer the howse or noe. He said yis, soe that all
“ might be remitted, and not otherwise. Wee rebuked his follie, and bad
“ him be packing. * Well, then,’ replied Aggnus, ‘if you both will stand
“ ‘ for me to his Majestic, I will come away and bring as many with me
“‘ as will submitt themselues to his Majesties mercie ’ ” (p. 244). The
Lieutenant promised to do his best for Angus, in the hope that dissensions
might thereby arise, and Angus, having agreed to return, re-entered the
castle. But the counsel of friends soon changed his mind, and he sent
back the soldier who had accompanied him, with the message that he
would not go back on the Lieutenant’s conditions. Calder and Lambert,
irritated at the unprofitable silence of their cannon for two hours and a

half, gave orders for the assault, which was carried out with such
vigour that the inner rampart, the well, and the buildings up to the
higher rock of the castle proper were soon a confused heap of ruins.
Again Angus sent to ask for a conference. The Lieutenant refused; Angus
might come when he liked, and with such following as he chose, but
meanwhile the bombardment would continue. The cannons were turned
on the outer walls, so that the troops might effect an easier entrance, and
lodge there in order to prevent escape by land. Shortly afterwards,
Angus, accompanied by his wife, Coil’s wife, and a few others, left the castle,
and the firing was stopped by the Lieutenant’s orders. Lambert feared
the rest might escape by sea, but Captain Button, who had rowed round
the walls throughout the previous night, advised him to look to his own
side. Yet the mariner was overconfident, for, in the interval of parley
with Angus, who protested that his friends were willing to submit, Coll
and a few men launched a boat by the archway to the west and made
good their escape, despite the musketry fire from a landward rock close
by. They landed five miles round, sank their boat, and dispersed. The
Lieutenant was chagrined at the escape of Coll, and sent a search-party
in pursuit. Angus had made the best of a bad job, and was perhaps
confident that the Chancellor’s warrant might bring him mercy.
Lambert despatched a companion letter to the King, telling less
about the expedition and much concerning the unruly nature of the
able-bodied warriors he had encountered, and giving, despite his hard-
ships from storms and rocky coasts, a flattering account of the fertility
and capacity of the island (p. 248), as well as high praise of Calder,
whose delays and unnecessary courtesies to the rebels he had apparently
forgotten. The laird remained at Dunivaig for some days. The convey-
ance of the island, in accordance with the charter of 14th November, was
completed in due legal form on 6th February (p. 239), in happy ignorance
of the fact that the Bishop of the Isles had complained that sundry
ecclesiastical lands had been conveyed away as if they had been temporal
lands and that his Majesty had ordered more circumspect proceeding
in future (p. 239,n.). Calder sent, on Bth February, a report of his success


to the Earl of Somerset, Lord Chamberlain of England ; but this document
has not been discovered (p. 249). On 20th April he had the satisfaction
to receive letters of approbation of his services and full remission for all
the havoc he and his friends had done in overpowering the “ infamous
“ tribe” of the Clandonald (pp. 255-9).
Proclamations were issued against Coll MacGillespic and other fugi-
tive Macdonalds (p. 249, n.), but the active part of this business was
practically over. The Council were now to devote themselves to the
examination of the prisoners and to endeavour to clear up the mystery
surrounding the doings of George Grahame. Grahame had been in
London, and so, too, had Archibald Campbell, but their accounts were so
contrary that King James wrote to Secretary Binning ordering the
examination of Grahame and the rebels of Dunivaig in Edinburgh and a
searching inquiry into the whole business. His Majesty had been struck
by a statement by Angus, that he would reveal “ an important secrete
“ upon some greate one,” and the Council were therefore at once to find the
truth “ withoute favour, feede, or respecte of any person whatsover ” (p.
250). Chancellor Dunfermline was strangely uneasy at this turn of
events, not that he was guilty, for he had had too “ lang apprentisage
“and training” in his Sacred Majesty’s school of honour to have committed
“ sua lourd ane faulte.” See his dutiful protestations to his Majesty in
his letter of 16th March (pp. 251-3).
The examination of Angus Oig and his companions who had been
brought to Edinburgh and lodged in the Tolbooth was conducted on 23rd
May by a committee of the Council, consisting of the Secretary, the
Treasurer-Depute, and the King’s Advocate. The lengthy depositions
and cross-examinations will be found on pp. 263-83, 294-303, 320-1.
Angus Oig had made a deposition at Dunivaig in March (p. 270), to the
truth of which he swore in presence of the examining Lords. He
explained his capture of the pledges as an act done in sudden anger,
because the Bishop had taken Donald Gorme, the natural son of Sir
James Macdonald (p. 267). This Donald, it seems, had been the
instigator of Eanald Oig to capture the castle, as he had heard that


“ the ile of Ila was to be gevin away be his Majestic, and that his
“ freindis was to be turnit out of the same ” (p. 265). The chief part of
Angus’s evidence is concerned with George Grahame, who at his first
meeting with Angus had stated that he had been sent with a warrant
from the Chancellor and Council to obtain possession of the Castle and the
pledges (p. 268), and that the paper had been written by the Chancellor
(p. 273). By Graham’s persuasion he had acquiesced and had handed over
the prisoners and the keys, but Graham would not take them, on the plea
that he had not a sufficient force to keep Dunivaig, and, further, in virtue
of an alleged power from the- Council to appoint a governor, had made
Angus Oig constable and had ordered him to deliver the castle to no
one till the decision of the Council should have been sent (p. 269). Even'
if the Lieutenant should have come and should have demanded his
surrender, he had been instructed to “miskene him absolutely” till
further orders were sent (p. 270). Grahame had even shown his
authority in a practical way by giving “some evill language” to a herald
who had been sent to demand submission, and had recommended Angus
not only to stay him but to slay him if he should have persisted in
the execution of the summons. The herald, he had told Angus, was no
King’s herald but an emissary of Calder, who “wald gett als mony
“ herauldis for money as hee pleasit to imploy in suche charges”; and
if troops came from Ireland they would not be sent by his Majesty, but at
the instigation of Calder’s friend, Archibald Campbell {ib.). When the
Lieutenant and Oliver Lambert had come, Angus had written to the
Chancellor expressing his astonishment at being troubled in that way,
but had received no answer from him, though he had had one from
Grahame (p. 274). The Council next turned their attention to the
possible implication of Sir James Macdonald in these rebellious
proceedings, but Angus denied that he had received any counsel
from his brother except to surrender the castle to those who should
be sent by his Majesty ( cf. the report of the Captain of the Guard,
ante, p. Iv). Angus’s reply to the question which had interested
the King so much, whether he knew that any great man had been


connected with the business, may be given in the vivid words of his
deposition:—
“ Being duelland in Arros 1 in the last sommer after the intaldng of the house,
“ and being accustomat sometymes for his recreatioun to talc a hacquebute and to
“ shoite at foullis, and being one day upoun the feildis with his hacquebute in his
“ hand, he persavis ane boit approtcheing neir the shoir; and the deponner past to
“ the shoirsyde to see who wes in the boit, and thair wes within hir Ewne
“ M°Writtie, who duellis in Gya, ane auld man of lx yeiris. And the deponner
“ haueing askit of him what newis he had, quhairfra he wes come, and yf the Erll
“ of Ergyle wes gone oute of Kintyre, the said Ewne ansuerit that the Erll wes
“ gone oute of Kintyre, and that the said Ewne his earand thair wes to the
“ deponner. And he said to the deponner that Malcolme M c Neill, uncle to Hector
“ M c Neill of Tawneishe, had directit the said Ewne to the deponnair to tell him,
“ that, he being in Kyntyre with the Erll of Ergyll, he hard some conference and
“ speeche in the Erlis house and company anent the taking, detening, and delyuerie
“ of the house of Dunnyvaig, and he hard the Erll say that he wes feared that this
“ deponner and his freindis wald gif ouer the house, and, yf thay did it and gaif
“ over the house, that it wald turne to thair utter wrak. And the said
“ Malcolme haueing askit of the Erll yf he might reveill that to the deponner,
“ the Erll ansuerit that he might without skaithe or perrell reveill the same,
“ and said that he had purpoislie spokin these wordis to the effect the same
“ might be reveillit and tauld to the deponner; and that the Erll desirit the
“ said Malcolme outher to go in persone, or then to direct some trustie freind
“to reveill and tell this to the deponner. Deponis, forder, that about ane
“ moneth afoir the Erll of Ergyll his last comeing to Kyntyre, Hector M c Keill
“ in Carskeyigh in Kyntyre send ane lettre to the deponner with Donald M c Connoyll
“ in Ha, desiring the deponner to appoint some tryist and meeting with him in the
“ He of Cara quhair thay might confer togidder, for he had some message fra the
“ Erll of Ergyll to the deponner whilk he wald reveill and showe to him at meeting.
“ And the deponner returnit bak ansuer with the said Donald, and appointit the
“ tyme and place of thair meeting to be in the ile of Cara. And the deponner at
“ the appointit tyme for the tryist send ane boit to the ile to see yf Hector had
“ keept tryist, bot Hector come not thair” (p. 275).
Perhaps this was not just the answer which the Committee expected.
We shall hear more of another great man who had dealings with the
coveted island. The statement of the other Islay prisoners is in general
1 Four miles to the east of Dunivaig.


corroboration of Angus’s account of Grahame’s proceedings. Hector
M c Caus added some details regarding Grahame’s treatment of Angus’s
letter to the Chancellor (p. 278), and Katherine Campbell, wife of Angus,
told, among other things, that she had heard Grahame say that “ Archibald
“ Campbell haueing informit his Majestic that the haill housses in the
“ ile of Ila being brint and destroyit, the goodis reft and slane, and the
“ poore inhabitantis so beggerit be the violence of the Clandonald as
“ thair wes no cloithis left upoun thame, bot the ile alluterlie distroyit
“ and layed waist, that thairby he movit the Kingis Majestic to so grite
“ anger that in his wraith he had gevin his commissioun to the Laird of
“ Caddell and Sir Olipher Lambert to persew thame within the house,
“ but, gif thay wald deliver to the said George Grahame the house and
“ pledgeis, that my Lord Chancellair wald do for thame and be cautioun
“ for thame,” and so on, in the terms of the alleged warrant (p. 282).
Robert Winrahame, Islay Herald, appeared, too, in the strange position of
witness for the rebel Angus, and gave a graphic account of the insults
which he had received at the hands of Grahame and his tools (pp. 279-80).
The examination of Grahame did not begin till 14th June, and
dragged on even till 6th July, for the Council, as we shall see, had
suddenly found themselves face to face with an Islay problem much more
difficult and more urgent. Grahame’s line of defence seems to have been
to negative nearly every statement made by Angus Oig and his friends.
He had never said that the instructions were inspired by the Chancellor,
or that they were written by him; he had not advised the islanders to
withstand Calder; and he had not thwarted the herald. When confronted
with Campbell of Hanna and Campbell of Aberurchill he gave them the
lie direct. The Secretary on one occasion told him plainly that he was
“ ane leud leier,” and the other Councillors seem to have taken much the
same view when they threatened that, if he halted any longer “by
“ concealing any reason or circumstance of any parte thereof, and so
“ draw upon him selfe the punishment eyther of his awne waywardness
“ or of an other manis offence . . . , the nexte wilbe a warrant to putte
“him in the boote” (p. 304). The “other man” was undoubtedly
k


Chancellor Dunfermline. Much as his wily emissary had prevaricated,
much as he himself had protested his innocence, he it was who had
deceived Angus Oig and his friends. We need not credit him with the
details of the trick. It was probably Grahame’s own desperate ingenuity
which scrawled the meaningless word “ Cathedrall ” at the foot of the
document (p. 298), a word so perilously like “ Cancellar,” the customary
abbreviation of “ Cancellarius,” that more than Angus Oig or the Laird of
Aberurchill might have been deceived. But the general plan of deception
was Dunfermline’s. He was anxious to have the credit of having rescued
the Bishop’s kin, and he employed the unprincipled Grahame to carry out
the work. Promises might be made, even instructions might be drawn
up, but they were not to have his authority : in this light we must read
his letter of protest to the King. Why was it that he thus lent himself
to a course of action as near the worst type of political lying as his
minion’s “ Cathedrall ” was to “ Cancellar” ? The evidence taken before the
Committee of the Council casts some light on this. When asked “yf he
“ delt with Coline Campbell [of Aberurchill] willing him to deale with
“ the Laird of Cadell to sell Ha to my Lord Chancellair,” he denied that
he had had any conversation with Colin concerning the Lord Chancellor,
but admitted “ that he conferrit with Coline to deale with the Laird for
“ selling of Ila to the deponner him selff, and he wald gif Cadell x m merkis
“ for his bargane, and he wald gif to Coline j m lib. for making of the
“ bargane ” [ib.). Truly an heroic offer for George Grahame, and thoroughly
consistent with the Chancellor’s fee of 1000 merks in ready money for
all his trouble in the dirty business ! The Chancellor had in 1610
become cautioner for Hector Maclean (p. 147, n.), and in 1612 had
been instrumental in cancelling Calder’s tack of Islay from Sir James’s
father (p. 152). In brief, we suspect his policy at Dunivaig was to
advise rebellion, as Argyll had done before, to get Calder to do the work
of subjugation, and, with the honour of having saved the lives of the
pledges, to persuade Calder, by such influence as he might command, to
surrender the coveted tack. Other two men are named in his agent’s
meagre confessions, the one, the Bishop of the Isles, who, still distressed


about his kin, had recommended to Grahame “ the cairfull doing of the
bussynes” (p. 298), the other, Sir James Macdonald, with whom
Grahame said he had had no dealings whatever (p. 297). With regard
to the latter Grahame may have lied, for the Chancellor might have
implicated Sir James to good purpose ; but the persistent evidence as to
the chiefs innocence is one of the most positive features of the whole
business.
On the day after Grahame’s last examination Angus Oig and his
associates were put on trial for the capture of Dunivaig and its detention
against Campbell of Calder, ■ and, b} ? the unanimous verdict of a
jury of Edinburgh tailors and bakers, received sentence of death. On
the next morning (Bth July) they were hanged at the Market Cross.
The people, Calderwood tells us, thought it hard that the Islesmen should
have been so treated, and that George Grahame should not have been
“ troubled by the Counsel or any other” (p. 319, n.). Dunfermline
would naturally not care to risk the scaffold-confessions of a disappointed
minion.
Angus Oig and his friends had been put to a very serious disadvantage
by the turn in events since their arrival in Edinburgh. The island
had been undisturbed since the conclusion of the campaign. Coll
MacGillespic had one day returned to Taxa, but, not venturing to cross
to Islay, had sent some of his men over to confer with friends. See the
interesting account by one of his associates of their doings since the
escape from Lambert’s musketeers, printed in the footnote on pp. 263-4.
Even Sir Ranald MacSorley had been forbidden to go to the island on any
pretext whatever before the Ist of July, and had been ordered, if any
Islay dues were outstanding, to sue for them in the Courts at Edinburgh
(p. 262). Humbled as the Macdonalds were, they were yet to make a
final struggle for the recovery of their island home.
On the 23rd of May, after Angus Oig had been handed over for the
night to Andrew White, jailer of the Tolbooth, and when the Council
clerks were writing letters to eight other Western chiefs, ordering
their appearance before the examining committee, Sir James Macdonald


escaped from the Castle of Edinburgh ! With the aid of Macßanald of
Gargavach and other friends he found easy passage to Newhaven, and
was already over the ferry and beyond Burntisland before the startling
news reached the unsuspecting Council. The fugitive continued north-
wards through the lands of Lochaber, where the Earl of Tullibardine’s
men pursued him hard. He lost his horse and clothes, and would have
been caught, had not the “ sudent medesin,” as he humorously calls the
hot pursuit, given him unusual nimbleness and endurance (p. 291 &c.).
He rounded on Islay by Ardnamurchan, Rum, and Eig, where he was
met by Coll MacGillespic with ceremonious rejoicing. 1 On 23rd June,
exactly one month after his escape from the Castle of Edinburgh, he
landed in sight of the ancestral castle of Dunivaig.
Sir James’s natural longing to be free had grown to a passion since the
legal victory of Calder. He tells us so in the stirring correspondence which
he found time to write during his dangerous circuit to the West. But
he adds, as a more cogent reason, that the Laird had said to several people
that “ how soever my tryall past anent the erand of Dwnoveg, yett he had
“ ane warand, in his avin keiping, past be his Majeste, quhilk the Consall
“ novayis did sie, commanding, immediatly efter the presenting thairof,
“to putt me to exsecutione butt farther proses” (p. 285); and he is
careful to explain to the Council that it was no mere desire to rebel
which had prompted him to break ward. He repeats the same in his long
letters to the Earl of Tullibardine, the Bishop of the Isles, the Earl of
Caithness, and the Earl of Crawfurd, —all on the same day ; and in his
second letter to the Earl of Caithness he gives the names of those who had
heard the threat, including Calder’s familiar, James Mowat (p. 289). He
breathes his hatred against the Campbells “ wha crawis ever to fish in
“drumly watters” (p. 287). “I knaw Calder and the Cambellis wilbe
“ buissie,” he adds, “ to seik imployment of service aganes me ; bott the
“ same sail nott be neidfull, for your lordschip [Earl of Caithness] and my
“ Lord Secrettar may better bring me to that quhilk salbe most to his
“ Majeste commodite and be quyetnes of the contre without bestowing oney

“ chargis nor all the Cambellis liveand may or can do by his Majesteis
“ fors” (p. 289) : and yet again, in sterner note, “ I wow to God, or I
“ lieve the centre, I, and moir nor I, sail ether lose our lyfes, or than I
“ sail, God willing, lieve ane rememberance to my onfreinds, —I mein only
“ sik of the Cambellis as wilbe my onfreinds, —that ittsalbe hard of when
“ both they and I is deid and gone, I hop to thair small commodite ”
(p. 290). We can admire this defiance in the face of terrible odds. It
would be difficult to find in the most romantic records a letter equal
to that printed on pp. 290-1, in which, with delightful literary art,
he confides to the Earl of Crawfurd his deepest thoughts and feelings.
Defiance and obedience, the longing for freedom and solicitude for his
books or his watch, the venom of clan hatred and the tender regard for
his friends the warders or his dearer Margaret, an ironical quip at the
hurry of his pursuers make, in their strange medley, a richer human docu-
ment than we should expect from a prison-bred islander, whose kin were
nothing but lawless savages in the eyes of a buffeted Council. “ I heir
“maney of the keipers of thatt Castell ar putt in ward for my braik” he writes
during his rough journey to the West, “ bott, as God sail judge me, thair
“ was nane of the keipers of that Castell that ever I thocht to mak prive
“to my desing. I protest to God I love the gud constable and all thatt
“is thair. I haitt none of thame, bott I culd nott bott love my self
“beter”; and, perhaps, his books at Edinburgh, which even the
hardships of flight could not bid him forget. Later, he laments the
capture during the onset at Athole of some volumes which he had taken
with him, —the “ Three Conversions of England,” Philip on the Contro-
verted Heads, a chronicle, and other tomes, —strange baggage for a scurry
for dear life through the rough Highland glens. The rightful Duke of
Milan had not sighed more for the friendship of his books in his mis-
fortunes.
The Council scarcely realised how much trouble was brewing. In a
leisurely way they issued a commission for the pursuit of the fugitive
(p. 283, n.), and on Bth June obtained ceremonious assurance from Calder
that he would see to the peace of the island and the safe-keeping of Duni


vaig (p. 292). A fortnight later they were still discussing the business,
and Calder remained in Edinburgh making proposals. Meanwhile the
Secretary had obtained Macdonald’s letters from the loyal Earl of Tulli-
bardine, to whom Sir James had entrusted them for delivery to his
friends (p. 293). The Council were not perturbed : they would only say
that Sir James had shown his allegiance to the King in a very strange
way and could expect no answer to his petition as long as he consorted
with rebels. They turned again to the examination of George Grahame,
and, by way of interlude, promised a reward of £SOOO for Sir James,
dead or alive, and another of 5000 merks for Coll MacGillespic (p.
296, n.). But, as details of the advance on Islay came in, they bestirred
themselves, sitting nearly the whole of the 20th, and again on the 22nd,
in discussion of what they had come to call the “ appeiring rebellioun of
Sir James M c Coneill ” (p. 303, n.). In a letter from the faithful Tulli-
bardine, dated 24th June, they got word that the rebels were off to
Islay; but, added his lordship, “if the cuntrie be upone thair gaird, as
“ thei suld, I think thei sail not profeitt mekill” (ih. ). That very
morning Dunivaig fell into the hands of the Macdonalds (p. 306).
Sir James, Coll MacGillespic, and their men, to the number of four
hundred, had hidden near the castle. When the captain, Alexander
Macdougall, and twelve of his little garrison of forty ventured out one
day, the Macdonalds made a furious attack, slew the captain and three
or four of his men, and pursued the rest of the little band within the
outer rampart, who escaped to the inner yard and closed the gate.
The Macdonalds laid siege and, after twelve hours, took the well, the outer
tower, and the two ramparts, fired the inner gate, and killed not a few of
the garrison, with the loss of a soldier and a boy and two men wounded.
At ten next morning the castle surrendered, and Alexander Campbell,
known as the Prior of Ardchattan, and his companions, were allowed to
depart (p. 316). The Prior, in hurrying off, received hard usage from
the brother of Maclean, from whom he had naturally expected better
treatment than from the Macdonalds. After his escape, he met Sir
James’s wife, who told him that Donald Gorme, the Captain of the


Clanranald, the Macleods, and even the Macleans, had joined her husband
(pp. 322, 324). In the list of the names of those who betrayed the
castle to Sir James are two of the Clanlean (p. 307, n.). A few
weeks later the alarmed Prior heard that Macfie of Colonsay had cast
in his lot with Macdonald and was transporting his cattle to Islay
(p. 325). The castle had probably not been carefully repaired since
the battery of Lambert’s cannon, and so had been an easy prey to
Sir James. He did not, it seems, set great store on it as a defence,
but resolved to prepare for emergencies by fortifying the island in Loch
Gorm. Six score men were daily at work building an earthen rampart
twenty feet thick; and a number repaired the old defences at Downand
(pp. 322-3). While superintending these operations, Sir James found
time to renew his correspondence with the Council and his friends. See
the six letters written from Islay during the first four days of July. He
repeats the reasons for his escape, and shows, even to Secretary Binning,
that he has abated none of his fury against the Campbells. “My lord,”
runs his postscript, “if his Majestic be not willing that I sail be his
“ Heighnes tennent in Ila, for Goddis cause let his Majestic hauld it in
“ his awin hand; for that is certane, I will die befoir I sie a Campbell
“posses it” (p. 310). He would not have meddled with the castle if it
had been in royal keeping, or in the hands of the Bishop, or even deso-
late ; but he found it in the power of those who sought his life and
lands and oppressed the “ puir island ” that they might lay it waste
rather than make it yield the King’s rent (p. 312). By the end of the
month Sir James’s position was well established. All Islay was with
him, and his clansmen were received with acclamation in Kintyre (p.
325, n.). From the head of Loch Kilkerran, whither he had gone for a
time, he sent out the fiery cross calling on all between Tarbert and the
Mull to take their holdings from him as their chief (p. 326, n.). His son
was left in command at Dunivaig to look out for the coming of hostile
ships, and the redoubted Coll was appointed captain of the huge earth
dyke on the island in Loch Gorm (p. 326).
The Council had received the first news of the capture of Dunivaig on


the morning of the 30th and had written off post-haste to his Majesty
(p. 308). They were in no good humour with the Earl of Argyll and his
friends, from whom the maintenance of good order in the island and
adjacent mainland was expected. Argyll’s absence had undoubtedly
been in favour of the Macdonald cause. “ The rebelis dispairis of any
“persute,” writes the Laird of Taynish, a month later, “and allures
“ many to follow thame be assuring thame of Argyles death. So Argyles
“ lang stay makis all thair pryde to increas ” (p. 325, n.). The
Council, after urging the King to send the Earl and his friends home
with all diligence, hurried through a number of proclamations and
commissions against the rebels (p. 308, n., et seq.). King James replied
on the 24th, intimating the appointment of the Earl, with power to take
order for the “ full and final ” pacification of the Western Isles (p. 324),
and four days later sent a missive of milder tenor, forbidding unnecessary
spoil in the island, and ordering the good treatment of those tenants who
might have fled through fear or taken up arms through compulsion ( ih .).
Sir James had ample time in Kilkerran or Kin loch to continue his
correspondence with his neighbours (p. 327-8) or his musings on Philip’s
“ Controverted Heads,” now that the harder task of convincing the royal
troops seemed to be indefinitely postponed. Argyll tarried, to the sore
vexation of the Council. Secretary Binning had been cheering the poor
Prior of Ardchattan and the Laird of Taynish with the early arrival of his
Lordship and his troops (p. 328). “We everie night expect the Erie of
“ Argyles cuming to this towne ” he wrote from the capital on 4th
August; but the Council on that very day had to give interim commis-
sion to the Laird of Auchinbreck (zb.). We get some clue to the
dangerous delay in the documents epitomised in the footnote on p. 331,
where we have a glimpse of Council jealousies, and of the lurking suspi-
cion of the Earl’s disinterested conduct, of which we have already had
some hints. Though King James solved the problem by associating with
the Earl, at his own request, a select number of the Council to act as
advisers, —somewhat explained away by a later letter (p. 331, n.), —
Secretary Binning was not to be baulked of the pleasure of giving the


Earl a “ biting ” letter, such as bad spurred the slow endeavour of the
Bishop of the Isles (pp. 331-3). He made no secret of his irritation at
the Earl’s unnecessary demand for a select committee, and taunted
him for his delay. The Earl was to have more jibes from him yet; but
he took his own time, though in his letters he would appear to be an
enthusiast. The Council issued their commission and instructions to him
on 22nd August; but the watchers on Dunivaig had full six weeks to
wait before his ships hove in sight.
There is a break in the rush of documents after Binning’s letter to the
Earl: in the next, dated 11th October, we are in the midst of the cam-
paign in the West. The Earl had arrived at Duntroon in the early days
of October. Finding that Sir James was in camp with nine hundred and
seventy men near the shore facing the Isle of Cara, on the friendly lands
of Largie, and that his vessels were at that island, he sent the Laird of
Raray (brother of the slaughtered Captain of Dunivaig), Campbell of
Calder, and others, with seven or eight hundred men, to surprise the rebels’
ships by night. He himself, with a like number, made a detour by the
east coast of the peninsula, and in the evening encamped at Tarbert,
ten miles from the Macdonalds. Ranald Mac James, the chief’s uncle, had
been sent that night to stop the passage there, and Coll MacGillespic, with
a body of sixty men and three boats, had pounced on the Kilberry lands,
and made captive the laird, Colin Campbell. Argyll’s unexpected
arrival put the Macdonalds to flight,—Coll, with his prisoner, by the
coast towards Gigha, thereafter upwards along Kintyre, till his vessels
were taken and some of his men killed; Ranald Mac James, with the
remnant of the Macdonalds, towards Islay, whither they were chased by
Calder within shot of Dunivaig. Sir James, thus bereft of his captains
and his men, fled. Argyll entered his camp, and hearing that he had
gone out of Kintyre to the island of Rachlin, off Ireland, turned north-
wards to Jura, where he encountered the royal ships the Charles and
the Cran and an artillery hoy which had been sent to support him.
The news that Sir James had crossed over from Rachlin to Islay
brought the Earl and the royal ships down to harbour of Leodamais,
I


the scene of Captain Button’s hard exploits. In two days the troops
were landed and safely encamped. Sir James lay to the West, at the
point of the Rinns, over against the island of Orsay. His object seems to
have been to escape in his boats to the North Isles, but the proximity
of the royal vessels made this impossible. He therefore requested a
truce for four days, which the Earl granted on condition that Dunivaig
and the fort in Lochgorm should be surrendered within twenty-four
hours. Coll, however, refused these terms, —though the Earl tells us he
had a secret message from him that he was willing to hand them over, —
and the Earl prepared to make a sea-attack by night on Sir James’s camp
with a force of one thousand men. The armed boats rowed ahead in
the moonlight, but as they passed the headland of the Oa they saw
beacons fired to warn Sir James of their approach. When they were
within six or seven miles of Orsay, Sir James took to his boats, sorely
against the will of his clansmen, who, knowing that no mercy would
be shown to them, declared their wish to die fighting by their chief.
But the counsels of Macßanald, the son of Sir James MacSorley, pre-
vailed, and the disappointed Macdonald, with an Irish company of forty,
loosed for the open on their way towards Donegal. Coll offered to sur-
render next day on condition that his life should be spared, which
Argyll accepted, because his troops were sick and provisions were
scarce (p. 350). The forts were delivered over to Calder, who received
from the Earl, at Dunivaig, on the 11th, a formal grant of the escheat
of the Clandonald in the island (p. 335). The Earl left the island
a few days later, and landed at Kilkerran, in Kintyre, on the 16th
(p. 346, n.). He was again at Dunivaig on the 29th, lingering for news
of Sir James, who, according to hearsay, was with his aunt, the Lady
Tyrconnel, in the north of Ireland, and was about to present himself to the
Deputy (p. 341). Argyll had sent news of his campaign to Secretary
Binning on the 13th and 29th, afterwards expanded in his official report
and that of his assistant, Archibald Campbell (p. 346 et seq.). Binning’s
replies are amusing. “ Your Lordships letters have cum heir with gud
“ speid,” he writes on the 16th, “ bot ane paket sent from this to Court


“ upon the 12 of this instant contenit adverteisment from my Lord
“ Chancellor to Court of all that your lordships letter of the 13 hes now
“ brought to me, quhilk I sail signifie to Court with all convenient
“ diligence, expecting better nowells be your lordship next adverteisment,
“ quhilk I pray God to send”; and then he proceeds, with a suspicion of
irony, to gossip about the death of Lady Arabella Stewart and affairs in
France (p. 337). Again, in a letter to Argyll’s factotum, Archibald
Campbell, he remarks, in cynical vein, that “ since Sir James and his sone,
“ with M°Rannald and his sone, and Glengarries sone, and M c Sorle, ar all
“ escaped, and Coll pardoned, • I know not quhat ringleaders these ar
“ whome ye wryt ye ar to bring in” (p. 340). Argyll perhaps suspected
the Secretary’s criticism, for he added these words, in a postscript to his
second letter, —“ This day I half causit execute nyne of the principalis
“ and leaderis. ... I hoip now dayly to be busie in executioun whill his
“ Hienes rebellis be brocht to ruine ” (p. 342). Argyll arrived in Edin-
burgh on 20th December, and laid his report before his critics on the
following day. We can imagine that it was Binning who, to be quits
with the Earl for his irritating indifference, asked him what he had done
with the carefully enumerated nine hundred threescore and ten rebels;
but no one excelled Sir Alexander Hay, Lord Clerk Register, in his pithy
innuendo in a letter to John Murray of Lochmaben, just before the
meeting with the Earl. “By many it is thoght,” he wrote, “ that, if
“ goodewill did secunde the dewtye which they ar bound to do, thir
“ frequent iyland employmentis wald not occurre so often. . . . When
“ thir employmentis ar so profitable in present pay, and a preparatioun
“ for making suite at Courte for service done, how easie a mater it is to
“ haif some of these unhallowed people with that unchristiane language
“ readye to furneis fresh wark for the tinker; and the mater so caryed
“as that it is impossible to deprehende the plotte ” (p. 345). The forcible
expression of this feeling is important: it is not the careless imputation
of Lowland Lords sick of the harryings in the West and the long
sederunts with George Grahame: it is not unexpected, after the hints
of preceding years.


The rebellion was at any rate crushed; and the Council were not long
in settling accounts with the stragglers. 1 Sir James’s hurried parting
was to be a long farewell; the waters round Orsay on that moonlight
night had surely moaned the sad Ha til mi tulidh of Macdonald exile.
His friend Coll might, in years to come, when stricken with age, resnatch
Dunivaig for a moment from the Campbells’ keeping, but his struggle
would be unavailing, and his miserable death would seal irrevocably
the doom of his race. Sir James may have gone with Some hope of
return and revenge; he had not gone to humble himself at the feet
of the Deputy of Ireland, as Argyll had given out, but to seek the pro-
tection of certain Jesuit friends in the town of Galway, and by their
aid to make his escape to Spain. When we next hear of him, in 1618, he
is in Flanders in the yet merrier company of the Catholic fugitive the
Earl of Argyll 2 , —a fitting finale to the romantic story of a century’s plot
and counter-plot! Throughout all the intrigue regarding the island the
Lords of Argyll appear as men far superior in political insight and diplo-
macy to the rough-and-ready islesmen around them. Connection with the
Court and residence in the Lowlands and in England had emphasised
this natural astuteness, and had developed, at all events in Archi-
bald, the seventh Earl, a conscious superiority, even contempt of his
western neighbours. Sir James Macdonald, on the other hand, who
stands out in marked contrast with the rest of his race, would have
proved a fair match for the Campbell in the game of politics had circum-
stances, been more favourable; and it is with regret, literary at least, that
we see the dash and defiance and the cultured promise of the young chief
blotted out in the commonplace reconciliation of exile. The Council
could not change their policy after the endless trouble which the islanders
had caused them, not even after the suspected Argyll had been proclaimed
a traitor. Though the King pardoned Sir James, and gave him a pension
in England, and even wished him to return to Scotland, the Council, in their
1 See The Register of the Privy Council, vols. x.
and xi.

vol. xi. pp. 468, 507.


wisdom, put obstacles in the way, and the chief lingered on in seclusion
till his death in London in 1626 (pp. 368, 375, nn.). Full as our informa-
tion is regarding the last struggle of the Macdonalds in Islay, it may be
that we have not discovered the whole secret of Sir James’s enterprise. It
would not be astonishing were some connection proved with the Catholic
ferment of the times and that the energetic Scots mission at Douai had
taken some advantage of the political crisis. The Jesuit martyr, John
Ogilvie, had come to Edinburgh in the summer of 1614, had gone to
London on some mysterious business at Court, had met a man from the
West and had returned to Edinburgh, had privately visited Sir James
Macdonald in the Castle, had gone, later, to Glasgow, had been bound for
Kin tyre on the supposed errand of buying horses, but had just then
fallen into the clutches of Archbishop Spotswood. Had he met the
crypto-catholic Argyll during his visit to Court ? Was it only of Philip’s
“ Controverted Heads ” that he had talked with Sir James in the Castle ?
What took this amateur horse-dealer to Kintyre ? Perhaps only for a
reason similar to that which sent his fellow-missionar, Pobert Philip, to
the country of Sir James’s prison-friend, the Catholic Lord Maxwell—
to save the souls of dependants, naturally disposed to be influenced by
their master’s fate. So, too, at his interview with Lady Maxwell in Glasgow
he may have spoken only of the consolation of religion. We should be
wary to attach too much political importance to the wanderings of the
impolitic Ogilvie, but this strange concatenation of events, the con-
temporary distrust of Argyll, and the Earl’s ultimate open confession of
the Catholic faith and association with the quondam rebel justify the
suspicion, even if future research prove it groundless. 1
It remained now for Sir John Campbell to enjoy his hard won posses-
sion ; but the prospect was gloomy. Though he was not to be troubled
by lawlessness, beyond an occasional inroad of sorners or masterful
beggars on his tenants’ lands (p. 361), he was to find that the promised

of the Privy Council (vol. x.), and the Editor’s
article on John Ogilvie in the Dictionary of
National Biography.


duty was a serious burden, and that the Council were the strictest of
creditors. His cares began at once with a dispute with the Bishop of
the Isles, probably about the inclusion of certain Church-lands of which
the latter had already made complaint to the King (p, 352, ante p. Ixv).
It may have referred to the lands in Islay, which of old formed part of
the temporalities of the Abbey of lona but had latterly been annexed to
the See of the Isles by Act of Parliament. The dispute was, however,
practically settled by July 1617, when the Bishop made formal renunciation
of all rights to the lands of Islay, except the tenandry of Lossit. This,
too, was secured to the Calder family, though not till 1626 (pp. 374-5),
when it was surrendered by Mr. Thomas Bollock, advocate, who had
received it by charter in 1617 from the Bishop and the newly-constituted
Chapter of the Isles (pp. 353-8). 1 The financial problem was much more
troublesome. The first hint of difficulties is in a letter from the laird’s
agent, James Mowat, in March 1618, wherein we hear that the Treasurer-
Depute had been calling attention to the unpaid taxation. The island
had naturally suffered much. Captain Wood had told Secretary Binning
in November 1615 that the land had been mightily spoiled and the tenants
almost undone (p. 343). Mowat did his best for his client, though it
was hard work amid rumours that even in the North the Calder finances
were not prosperous; and the friendly Laird of Alter endeavoured to hush
them by saying that his worship lived so quietly and honestly, looking
after his own affairs, and in retirement from the Court (p. 363). There
was respite for a time, and Calder turned his attention to strengthening
his position in the island. He obtained bands of obedience from a ,
number of the tenants, who stated in legal form that their association
with the Clandonald in the past had been by compulsion and through
fear of their lives. These documents are unfortunately printed in
abstract, but, even as they stand, they are of considerable genealogical
interest, if only because of the division into septs or family groups (p.
364). The prospect of increasing the rental by mining had opened
up some years before. In 1616 Archibald Primrose had received
1 The lands included in the tenandry are described on pp. 354-5.


a patent for working copper and lead in the island, as well as in Mull,
Skye, and Lewis, but the proposal was too general to be of much
practical value. Three years later Primrose had a report drawn up
about the lead ore in the island, but little came of it (p. 365). Calder
was thinking seriously of the matter, and had been advised to invite
some Englishmen to develop both the mines and the fishing (p. 367),
and had even gone so far as to offer a grassum of 15,000 merks
to the Crown for a tack of the mines for nineteen years. The Crown
officials, however, did not take kindly to the proposal. The matter was
probably soon forgotten: at least it is not till fifty years later, and again
about 1720, that we hear of any serious attempt to work the minerals
(pp. 456-467). Meanwhile Calder’s financial struggle continued. He
had been put to the horn on 22nd May 1618, and in March 1619
arrangements were being made to grant his escheat and liferent
to his kinsman, Donald Campbell, the lands of Islay being excepted
in order to make the Laird more “ mindfull ” of his duties (p. 365).
The watchful Mowat, however, discovered that Donald was involved
in some troubles, and he secured the insertion of his own name in the
gift (p. 366, and n.). He cheered the Laird with news of the King’s
goodwill, and pointed out how profitable it might be to stimulate it by
his presence at Court. Matters were as bad as ever in the spring of 1620
when Mowat was informed by the Lords that, as Calder had not paid
his rent for two years, they would make over his liferent and escheat, in
all probability, to the Lady Home. The agent pled with some success,
and wrote off to Calder to send some money, or some excuse, and to be
careful to give his best thanks to those Councillors who had befriended
him (p. 368). Mowat was in England in September 1621 watching his
client’s interest at Court. Sir James Macdonald had returned from
abroad, and Coll MacGillespic had already professed his desire to become
a dutiful subject (p. 366, n.), —not the best of news to the embarrassed
Laird, even though Parliament had just ratified his charter of 1614
(pp. 369-70). About this time the Laird’s creditors had conferred
together, and William Campbell of Brachlie, a younger brother of the


Laird, had been appointed chamberlain of the island for the collection
of the Crown rents. The ominous omission of all mention of Islay when
Calder resigned his estates to his son John, known as the Fiar, in 1622,
on the occasion of the latter’s marriage (p. 371, n.), finds its commentary
in a letter from Mowat in the following spring. The Laird, it seems,
had already made known his desire to sell the island, and not a few had
been making offers, including even the Clandonald in conjunction with
the Earl of Mar (p. 370). The transaction was not, however, carried
out, and the island was resigned in favour of his son in July 1626
(p. 372) and a charter granted in the following month (p. 374) ; and
the outlying Church-lands of Lossit, which had been in the hands of
Mr. Eollock, advocate {ante, p. Ixxxii), were, about the same time, secured
to the Fiar (pp. 374-5). The old Laird lived on till 1653 in retirement,
varied by little, till his second marriage to Dame Elizabeth Douglas
who had a “ maintenance ” for herself, beyond homings for debt or
the pleasurable realisation of certain family nicknacks to his more beloved
second son Colin. 1
The first public duty which the Fiar was called upon to perform was
to expel his uncle William, the chamberlain, who had been taking advan-
tage of his position to reason the “ ignorant inhabitants ” of the island
into Eoman Catholicism. The Council had issued a general warrant to a
number of lairds, including the Fiar, against the repair of Jesuits to their
bounds, but Mr. William had been singled out for special condemnation and
summary ejection (p. 371). The exile of kinsmen, even if Catholics, was not
part of the Fiar’s policy. During his short lairdship he strengthened
the Campbell interests in a remarkable way. We have already seen how
the tenandry of Lossit had been acquired: w r e have now to note the
addition, in February 1629, of the lands of Knockranisale, Ardararicht,
Ardelesyne, and Argarie. They were a part of the barony of Gigha,
which had been held by Archibald, a natural son of Angus Macdonald.
His son John was seised in them in May 1627 (p. 376), but was pre-
vailed upon to sell them to the Fiar two years later (pp. 380-1). There
1 See the Thanes of Cawdor, pp. 278, 281, 282, 313.


remained the hereditary Macbeth estate of Ballinaby, Areset, How, and
Saligo; that, too, was surrendered, but into the hands of another Camp-
bell, Lord Lome (p. 383). The Fiar gave portions of his extended
patrimony to kinsmen : “ peopled the said ylland with a number of his
“ awne freinds” are his own words (p. 385). A glance at the list of
names in the valuation of the teinds in 1636 will show that all the
heritors, with the exception of the tenant of Balleharvie and Octocor-
uoch, were Campbells (pp. 388-90). There was, therefore, less prospect
of success for a belated offer from the Earl of Antrim to purchase the
island (p. 378) than there had been for the former proposals from Dun-
luce {ante, p. xliv). The Macdonalds, whether Scottish or Irish, were not
to expect to return to Islay. The last blow was threatened in the demolition
of the castle of Dunivaig. The King had advised Sir John Campbell to
dismantle what remained after the rebellion, but he had not ventured
to do it, partly on account of the unsettled state of the island, partly
because he had no other place of residence. It was always a source of
danger when the Laird was out of the island, as in the summer of 1630,
when a “ fearefull,” though unsuccessful, assault was made upon it by
some islesmen during the absence of the Fiar in Edinburgh (p. 385). As
the presence of a number of well-disposed Campbells in the island was
not a sufficient guarantee against sudden turmoil, and as the Fiar had
intended to build “a more commodious house for his awne dwelling,
“ and in a more proper pairt of the yle,” the Council sanctioned the
destruction of the ruinous fortress (ib.). The resolution, however, does not
seem to have been carried out, for we hear of the castle offering a stout
resistance in 1647, though it had soon to surrender for lack of water
(p. 400). The well had probably been beyond repair since the battery
in 1614.
The Fiar’s career was abruptly closed in the autumn of 1639. He had
not been on good terms with his father after his second marriage, nor,
if the scandal told by Spalding in his Troubles be believed, 1 with his own
wife, the daughter of the evergreen translator of Rabelais, Perhaps we

m


find the explanation of this unhappiness in the symptoms of mental ill-
ness which had developed in the beginning of 1637. We hear of errands
to Islay by physicians throughout 1638 (pp. 452-3). The malady
was found to be incurable; and at an inquest at Forres on 19th September
1639 the Fiar was proved to be hopelessly insane. He seems to have
remained on in seclusion in the island, receiving an occasional visit from
Dr. O’Conochar of Lorn, till his death in June 1654. His son Colin
being a child, his brother Colin was entrusted with the management of
the estates. The young boy’s rights were secured in due legal form
(pp. 391 et seq.), but he did not live to enjoy his lairdship. He died
at Irvine while a student at Glasgow University, sometime between 1647
and 1650 (p. 392, n.).
Colin Campbell’s tutorship extends from 1639 to his death in Septem-
ber 1642. The scraps of information regarding the island during his
brief authority deal chiefly with the gathering religious troubles in
Scotland and the rebellion in Ireland. The Tutor, like Argyll, was a
staunch adherent of the Puritan party. 1 Eoyal ships had been in the
Sound of Islay in June 1636 (p. 453), but it was not till 1639 that the
island was affected by the national stir. The Tutor’s accounts show that
in that year he bought a quantity of ammunition, probably for the fort
in Loch Gorm, in which he had a small paid garrison of six men, four
boys, and one woman, under John Campbell, son of the Prior of Ard-
chattan (ib.). In 1641 he continued his warlike preparations, spending
£531 in the purchase and repair of a galley, and other sums on ammu-
nition, including a contribution to the Marquis of Argyll (ib.). Beyond
a journey to Kintyre in January 1641, to take order with some of the
Clandonald, he seems latterly to have remained in the island in strict
surveillance of such tenants as might be affected by the general spirit of
restlessness among the Western clans. His younger brother, George,
latterly of Airds, undertook the active part of assisting in the cam-
paign in the North of Ireland in 1642. He complains, in a letter written
on 4th July, that the Irish captains were much troubled by the coming
1 See Thanes of Cawdor, p. 297.


of bands of unruly Islay folk, 1 and appeals strongly to his brother to
send over honest men, who will be a credit to his companies (p. 394).
He had, however, a more serious personal complaint, which hints that
his brother had found the administration of the island a hard task “It
is not eneughe,” he writes, “ to thame that hes banist me of Ilia to doe
“ quhat they did to my self, bot to say that they will scarr and flie and
“ missuse the gentilwoman and lay waist the landis of the Laird of
“ Calder that payis deir dewteis for it now a dayis. Quherfoir I intreat
“ yow latt me not haue cause till give up your name and compleine for
“ the same till betteris, and that your name be not slanderit heiranent”
(p. 395). The gentlewoman was his wife, Janet, daughter of Campbell
of Dunstaffnage, but the reference to her treatment “as a widow ”
during his absence, and to his own misfortunes, is somewhat vague.
The death of the Tutor on 12th September 1642 summoned the un-
happy George to Islay, to protect the interests of young Calder (p.
396, n.). The difficulties of lairdship increased. The sending of drafts to
Ireland (pp. 394, 396, n.) and the inroads of anti-Covenanting Highlanders
(pp. 396, n., 397) so obstructed agriculture and destroyed the stock-
markets that the Campbells were once more unable to pay the Crown
rent. There is a blank in the account-books of the Tutor from 1643 to
1649, the latter being described as the “first year of the compter his
intromissioun efter the wasting of the landis.” The united revenue of
Islay and Muckairn had been over £20,000 per annum, but in 1651 it
scarcely exceeded £2,000 (p. 397, n.) There was therefore some reason
for the petition of the Laird and the Marquis of Argyll for the remis-
sion of their unpaid duties (pp. 396-7, 398).
The chief interest of these troubles centres round the disciplinary visits
in 1647 of General Lesley, the Covenanting leader. The adventurous
spirit of Coll MacGillespic Keitache, the right arm of Sir James Mac-
donald in his last struggle, had descended to his more notorious son,
Allaster M c Coll Keitache, or “ Colkitto ”, lieutenant-general to the Marquis
of Montrose. He was the more strenuous against the Marquis of Argyll
1 See the list of Islay names on p. 395.


on account of the inherited hatred of the Campbells, but his animosity was
embittered by a recent feud in Colonsay. Old Coll had succeeded to the
lands of his unfortunate ally Malcolm Macfie {ante, p. Ixxv), but the
Campbells had picked a quarrel with him and had sent him packing. 1
Colkitto’s influence with Montrose’s Highlanders was such that he with-
drew them to serve his own purposes in the West, —an action which was
the cause of the disaster at Philiphaugh. He turned towards Kintyre and
Islay and soon put the unhappy Tutor in straits. Dunivaig, not yet
a hopeless ruin, was invested by two hundred men, over whom he placed
his aged father; and a little island, probably Orsay, where Sir James had last
held out, was garrisoned by some Highlanders, under a natural son. Leslie
swooped down to the rescue of the Campbell lands, drove Colkitto from
Dunaverty, and crossed over to Islay (p. 400). Dunivaig offered a stout
resistance but had to yield because of the lack of water. Captain O’Neil,
Donald Gorme, and the other officers were allowed to depart on condition
that the rank and file were transported to France. Old Coll did not fare
so well. He had forgotten the cunning of former days, and had ventured
out on parole, before the surrender, to speak with his old friend the
Captain of Dunstaffuage. He was traitorously made prisoner, tried by
Argyll’s sheriff-depute, George Campbell, and thereafter hanged from the
mast of his own galley laid across the high rocks at Dunstafihage. 2
The bastard was left to himself in his “ litle skurvie ile ”, as the triumphant
Sir Thomas Turner called it, and Leslie’s troops retired after their easy
victories to Jura and Mull. So faded the afterglow of the Macdonalds’
hopes. We hear nothing of the doings of the Campbells. Had the
Tutor had the literary turn of Sir James Macdonald, we should have
hoped yet to find something concerning the rude rebellion of Colkitto
and his friends, or even a hint as to how the brain-sick Fiar took the
tumult in his domain.
Eeferences to the island during the period of the Commonwealth are
very scanty and relate chiefly to the garrisoning of the island. The
Scottish Parliament had passed an Act, in February 1649, continuing a
1 Gregory, p. 413.
2 1h., p. 414.


small garrison of thirty-five in the island, but relieving the Tutor of the
expense of maintenance (p. 401, and n.). The Tutor seems, however, to
have found the troops to be a serious burden, perhaps because the state of
public finance had made the Act a dead letter. Accordingly in 1652 he
negotiated with the English forces for their removal. That summer the
island was visited by Lieutenant-Colonel Cottrell and some English soldiers
to make a military survey and to take special note of the state of Dunivaig.
The account-books testify that they “ did behaif thaim selfiis discreitlie
towardis the countrey ” and received for their courtesy the present of
an ox as a mark of the Tutor’s goodwill (p. 454). Next year an English
transport stopped at the island on its way to the North Isles and received
a like gift for a like forbearance (ib.). In January 1658 a certain Colonel
Nathaniel Whetham was granted the revenue of some unnamed lands
in the island till he had obtained the sum of £1624, 15s. due for his
services to Oliver Cromwell’s government (p. 401). He received this
gift in exchange for the rent of the Abbey of Inchaffray; but it is
probable the Restoration interrupted the worthy man’s financial scheme.
From the Restoration onwards the documents are chiefly formal. Old
Sir John had survived till 1654, fourteen years beyond the untimely
death of his son Colin. Hugh, the eldest son of Colin, the first Tutor,
was now the heir, and a series of documents, beginning on p. 403,
signify his assumption of lairdship from the hands of Tutor George ;
who was to live on till 1685. He received infeftment in his Islay estate
on 10th May 1662 (p. 412, n.). The lands were managed by his uncle,
James of Kilbrandan, whose time was peacefully spent in selling cattle
and in horse-breeding, in superintending the building of the new house
at Killarow, and in looking after the blackcock and deer (p, 414, n.).
The cattle business, always the staple of the island from the earliest
times, seems to have been on an extensive scale, for we find that he sold,
in 1680, one thousand three-year-old oxen and cows. The interest in the
lead-ore had revived, but, as before, it did not get further than reports
(ib.). This commercial peace remained undisturbed till the Revolution,
In the insurrection of 1679 a number of Islay men were employed for a


short time against the rebels in Lorn, Appin, and Mull, and gained the
goodwill of their commander as the “ prettiest, boldest, and sickerest men
he hade” (p. 416, n.); but it was not till 1685, however, that the island
was seriously involved in the Covenanting troubles. The young Earl of
Argyll, son of the great Marquis, having escaped to Holland after his trial,
had remained there till the spring of that year, when he set out from
Amsterdam on his memorable expedition to the Western Islands of Scot-
land. He arrived at Islay on 14th May 1685. The story of his proceed-
ings there will be found in the narrative of his companion, John Erskine
of Carnock, in the footnote on p. 418, and need not be here transcribed
in less vivid language. We have in this description an interesting
glimpse of the laird and his new house at Killarow. Calder, for once,
was not in political unison with the Lord of Argyll, though we have nothing
more definite than Erskine’s statement that he did “ what lay in his
power to hinder the people’s rising with Argyll.” His examination on
Ist September of the tenants who had associated themselves with his
kinsman (p. 417, n.) was a necessary judicial ceremony, somewhat half-
hearted and dilatory. “ His family alliance and interest, as well as his
“ religious leanings, and those of his wife,” says Mr. Cosmo Innes, “ were
“ all in favour of the Revolution. Like a large proportion of the Scotch
“ gentry, however, he was opposed to the ‘ Incorporating Union,’ and we
“ may conjecture that disgust with that unpopular measure, and some
“ natural compunctions for the old famity, whose faults were in part for-
“ gotten, induced him, on the Queen’s death, to support the foolish rising
“of ’15.” 1 In his petition to the Chancellor and the Privy Council,
printed on pp. 416-7, he asserts his loyalty, but his statement in the
preamble,—that, when the rebellion broke out, he had offered to go to Islay,
or to send his son to take order for the obedience of the people and the
payment of the Crown duties and his own rents, but that their Lordships,
“upon better consideratione,” did not think fit to admit the same, —seems to
hint that the Council had suspicions of his protestations, probably because
of the rebellion of the allied house of Argyll. The prosperity of the island
1 Thanes of Cawdor, p. xlii.


must have suffered from these random manoeuvres; for we find that Sir
Hugh resolved to risk sending a drove of cattle to the distant and
uncertain markets in England, rather than to leave them at the mercy
of his enemies (p. 419, n.).
On 13th November 1688 Sir Hugh resigned the lands of Islay and
Jura to his heir Alexander and his wife, Elizabeth Lort, and disponed
all his property on 23rd October 1691, with the reservation of a life-
rent, from which, however, the Islay lands were exempted. The charter
under the Great Seal followed on 10th February 1693 (p. 419, n.).
The young laird’s policy seems to have been to acquire the lauds which
had been parcelled out to kinsmen by his predecessors, as the lands of
Glassens, held by Alexander Campbell (pp. 419-20), of Torrabolls and
Persabus, held by Neil Campbell (p. 421). The mining schemes
still proved attractive, but the practical result was meagre. In June
1693 he obtained permission to establish two annual fairs near his
new house at Killarow (p. 419). The next reference to the island and
its laird is the curious list of funeral charges incurred in September 1697
after Sir Alexander’s untimely death. The thousand pounds and more
spent on whisky and tobacco and brandy, sweetmeats and fowls, at this
festive mourning give an exaggerated impression of the popular grief and
the flourishing state of the Calder treasury.
Sir Alexander’s successor, Gilbert, in whose name a tack of the teinds
of the island was granted in 1699 (p. 423), died when young, and the
estates passed to his brother John, who was served heir to his father
on 4th April 1717 and received a tack of the teinds in February 1721
(p. 424). In November of that year we hear that proposals by Daniel
Campbell of Shawfield to purchase the island were being seriously
entertained. The details of these overtures will be found in the corre-
spondence on p. 424 et seq. The result was the grant of a wadset of
the island in the autumn of 1723 (p. 429) and thereafter, in July
1726, of a disposition of all Calder’s rights to the laird of Shaw-
field, in whose family the superiority of the island remained till
the middle of the present century.


Of Campbell of Shawfield’s lairdslup it is not our present purpose to speak.
A few legal documents dealing with that period are printed at the end
of the text, and a number of papers concerning the mines, fishing,
packet-service, and other improvements about 1760 will be found in the
Appendix; but the fullest story of the life in the island must be ex-
tracted from the formal minutes of the Stent Book , which covers the
period from 1718 to 1843. All is orderly compared with previous
times: the commonplaces of parochial ambition and discipline have
succeeded to the turmoil of clan-feuds and the dignity of campaigns.
This is perhaps interesting as showing the transition from the bankrupt
days of the Campbells of Calder to the modern prosperity of the island,
but it lacks the romance of the earlier times when allegiance was sworn
to the restless chiefs of the Clandonald.

Translation.
Then King Magnus set forth with his company to Isla: he made war there, and burnt;
and when he had won that country, then he went south under Cantire, and made war there
on both countries, both upward [east] on Scotland, and outward [west] on Ireland. He went
thus in a warlike manner all the way south to Man, and made war there as elsewhere. So
says Bjorn,—
The swift king bore the shields wide over the links of Sandey;
There was smoke over Isla, when the prince’s men were increasing the conflagrations. 1

to the Sudreys written early in the thirteenth cen-
tury:—Hie (Magnus) sine mora coadunari fecit
classem centum sexaginta navium, et ad Orcades

1 The notices of the family of Somerled about the
beginning of the thirteenth century give us some
glimpses of the island. Somerled’s son Reginald
obtained it with other lands. On the death of
his elder half-brother Somerled, he became tutor
to his nephew John, and “had several bickerings
with Dugall of Lorn, his brother, about the Isles
of Mull. . . . When John passed the years of his
minority he desired his uncle Reginald to send a
party with him to apprehend Muohdanach who
held the lands of Moidart and Ardnamurohan, who
always assisted Dugall against his uncle Reginald.”
In the attack, Muchdanach was slain. Reginald,
who desired only his arrest, was so wroth that
John saw fit “to ask no more of his father’s
but the lands of Ardnamurchan and Glassridh in
Argyll and twenty pound lands of Isla, which his
uncle granted him ” ( Macdonald MS. — Coll, de rebus
Alban., p. 288). Reginald’s son Donald succeeded
him in the lands of Isla and Kintyre, and was the
founder of the Macdonalds of Isla. His other son,
Euari, was the founder of the Macruaries of Bute.
Gregory notes the fact that both the Macdonalds
and Macruaries used the territorial surnames of “de
Yla ’’ and “de Insulis ” ( Highlands and Western
Isles, p. 18, footnote).

1 Munch reads “Terras Abberade in Yle.”
Inability to identify this name, and the omission
of “de,” prompted the suspicion that some mis-
take was made by the original scribe or by the
later copyist when expanding the contractions,
and that the reading was “Terras dblatie ,” the
abbeylands. The contracted form of the word in
the MS. appears to read “ Abbad,” which favours
the version given in the text, and states a histo-
rical fact. Mr Hector Maclean cannot think of
any place-name in the island which could corre-
spond to Munch’s reading. Strange to say, in a
rental of the year 1561, the lands of Muckaim and
Camusnanesserim are grouped together with the
lands of Ardneiv in Isla, as holding of the abbot
of lona. But Ardneiv would bo a very violent
interpretation of “Ahbad.”

Translation,
Innocent, bishop, servant of the servants of God, to his beloved sons, Celestine, abbot
of St. Columba of the island of Hy, and his brethren, now or to come, professing the
religious life in perpetuity, greeting and apostolic blessing. It is right that the apostolic
protection should be over those who have chosen the religious life, lest, perchance, some
hasty impulse either entice them from their purpose or weaken, which God forbid, the
power of holy religion. Therefore, beloved in the Lord, we grant your reasonable
petitions, and we take under the protection of St. Peter and ourselves, and make secure
by the authority of these presents, the foresaid monastery of St. Columba, in which you
have given yourselves to the service of God; ordaining, in especial, that the monastic
community, which is known to be established in the same place in accordance with the
will of God and the rule of St. Benedict, be preserved inviolate there in all time
coming; further, that whatsoever possessions, whatsoever property in the form of gifts
you may by the law of the land and the church possess, whether by future grants of
pontiffs, the liberality of kings, the endowment of princes, and offerings of the faithful,
or by other lawful means, which you may by divine grace obtain, shall remain firm and
unimpaired with you and your successors. We have thought fit to specify them in
express terms here, as follows, —the place itself in which the foresaid monastery is situated,
with all its pertinents ; the island chinches of Mule, Coluansei, Cheldubsenaig, Chelcenneg,
and He; the islands of Hy, Mule, Coluansei, Oruansei, Canei, and Calue; the lands of
Magenburg, of Mangecheles, of Herilnean, of Sotesdal; the lands of the abbey in Tie, of
Markarna, and of Camusnamesre. Let no one forsooth presume to exact or extort from
you the tithes of your lands which you have cultivated at your own expense, (and) from
which no one has hitherto received aught, or from the sucklings of your flocks. We
ordain, besides, the right of sepulture in that place to be free, so that no one may thwart
the devout desire and last will of those who have set their minds on being buried
there, unless they happen to have been excommunicated and are under interdict, or are


public usurers; reserving, nevertheless, the privileges of those churches to which the
bodies of the dead by right belonged. On the death of you, now abbot of that place,
or any of your successors, let no one be put in authority by any subtle scheming or
violence, but only him whom the brethren, or the wiser part of the brethren, have in
the fear of God and by the rule of St. Benedict nominated for election. But, as a
sign of this protection received from the Holy See, you shall pay annually a free
offering of two bezants to us and to our successors. We ordain therefore that no one
whatever shall be allowed rashly to disturb the foresaid place or to spoil its possessions and
retain, lessen, or by any persecution abuse what has been taken; but that all things
belonging to those for whose rule and support they were granted be preserved whole, to
be of use in the fullest manner, —reserving the authority of the Holy See, and the
canonical jurisdiction of the bishops of the diocese. If, therefore, in future, any
ecclesiastic or layman knowing the tenor of this our constitution shall endeavour to do
rashly in opposition to it, and, after a second or third warning, do not make good his
offence by giving proper satisfaction, let him be cut off from his privileges of authority and
honour, and let him know that he stands condemned by divine judgment for the iniquity
he has done, and let him be denied the most sacred body and blood of God and our Lord
and Redeemer Jesus Christ, and let him be given over to strict retribution at the last
judgment. May the peace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all those who do His will in
that place, so that here they may reap the fruits of a good life, and before the severe
Judge receive the reward of eternal peace. Amen. Amen. Amen. Given at Agnani,
under the hand of John, subdcacon and notary of the Holy Roman Church, the fifth day
before the Ides of December, the seventh Indiction, the year of the Incarnation 1203, and
of the pontificate of Pope Innocent 111., the sixth year.

After that they came together with all their forces south into Isla-sound. There were
there Ospac’s two brethren, Duggall [Dubhgal] and Dungadh [Donnchadh], and third was
the chief whose name was Sumarlidhi [Somarled], a kinsman of theirs, and they had a
great company. They bid the Northmen to a feast, and they had plenty of wine. It was
told the Northmen that all would not be void of treason, and therefore they would not go
to the feast. Each side gathered their company together, for neither side trusted the other.
Duncan slept aboard the ship of his brother Ospac. A little later the Northmen made an
onslaught upon the Sudreymen and slew Somarled, and many men with him. They took
Duggal prisoner, and set him in fetters. Few of the Northmen fell King Ospac was not
at this, and when he became aware of it, he hastily got his brother Duncan away, but his
brother Duggal he took under his own protection. Now they gathered a company over the
Islands, and got altogether eighty ships; and sailed south by the Mull of Cantire, and so
east to Bute.

Sennaohies, was the sou of Donald of Isla [ante,

in 1266 (see Appendix), Angus became a vassal of
the Scottish Crown.

Translation.
Then men came from Duggal to the king; and said that Margadh and. Engus [Angus] of
Cantire wished to give up the lands that they held, and offered the King their followers’
service. But the King [Hacon] gave them answer, that he would not make war there, if
they came into his power [ie., gave themselves up to him] by the morrow before high day
[noon]; “But if they are not come in, I let my men invade and make war.” With that


the messengers went back. But the king then provided men for the attack, so that two
parts [two-thirds] of the host were to go. But the morning after Margadh came in under
the king’s power, and put all that he had into his possession. A little later Angus came
and gave his service in under the king’s power. King Hacon therefore promised them both
to get them peace from the King of Scots, if there were peace made between the kings
[Hacon and the King of Scots], Then they gave King Hacon hostages and swore oaths to
him. Then King Hacon made them letters for his own men whom he had appointed to
make war on the headland [Cantire] that they should cease from warring: and ho laid a
tribute upon the headland, ten hundred beasts over and above what was taken in war before.
Angus and he made peace on these terms, that he gave up the island of Isla into the king’s
power, but the king gave him the island on the terms that the chiefs of the men of the
Sudreys held of him before. As it is said in the Raven’s-talk:
The swift-spoken Norwegian king held eastward
In his glorious galleys into the Sudreys ;
Angus gave up the spoil of war,
Isla to the keen king.
After that 1 King Hacon sailed down from Malasey [Lamlash] and lay the night over
under Herrey [Arran], and thence along Sandoy [Sanda], and so to the Mull of Cantire,
and came about the night north under Gudhey [Gigha], and thence he sailed west into Isla-
Sound, and lay there two nights. He laid a tribute on the island, 300 beasts; it was to he
paid part in meal and cheese; and he left men there to receive it. King Hacon sailed
thence, Sunday in the winter nights [first days of winter], and met such a great storm and
darkness or fog that scarce one ship held with whole sails, and from many all was carried
away. Then the king put into harbour at Kiarbarey [Kerrera], and men went between
him and King John [over a peace], but yet nothing came of their meetings. 2
1 i.e., after the fight at Largs.
2 The later fortunes of Angus (1265) are thus
described in the Magnuss Saga (Haconar Sonar,
ch. 4., ed. Vigfusson, p. 364; Fms. x. 1589): —
“King Magnus [Hacon’s son] went in the spring
south to Bergen, and came there after Easter.
Then he sent to Scotland Bishop Gilbert and Sir
Askatin, as the King of Scots had asked him. They
went first to England south to Lynn. There was
at that time great strife in England. That sum-
mer Simon Montfort was killed. The bishop and
his monk then went northwards to York, and were
there for a while. In the fall when Ogmund Crow-
dance and his company came to the Orkneys, and
the Soots had gone to take tribute off the Caithness
people, there came upon them Lord Dufgall as they
were coming back, and slew many of them, and took
the wealth that they were taking with them. He
slew the lawman [perhaps sheriff) of the Soots there.
That summer the Scots went out into the Sudreys
with a host, and Angus in Isla then came in under
the Scots, and many more of them that had
followed King Hacon when he was in the Sudreys.
They all went south to Man, and forced Magnus,
their lord, to enter into oaths with them. But
Lord Dufgall was on his guard and aboard of his
ship, and they got no hold upon him.”
Angus Oig of Isla (son of Angus Mor) was
a partisan of Robert the Bruce (see a Charter by
Robert I. to him of the Isle of Isla, &c., referred to
in Robertson’s Missing Charters , p. 41), and was on
that account in frequent conflict with Alexander, a
son of Angus Mor, and his allies, the Macdougals,
who laid claim to the island of Mull. The fol-
lowing anecdote is taken from the Macdonald
MS. (p. 290); —“At the time when Macdougall
went to Isla, thinking to surprise Angus, Lord of
the Isles, he sent a spy before him to know where
Angus then was. There was a countryman plough-
ing near the harbour, and the Lord of the Isles


VI.—INDENTURE BETWEEN EDWARD BALLIOL AND JOHN OF THE ISLES
GRANTING TO THE LATTER THE ISLAND OF ISLAY AND OTHER LANDS
ON CONDITION OF HOMAGE.¹

walked for his recreation after the plough. The
spy knew him immediately. They asked him
whither he was going, and whence he came 2 He
answered, he was lately of MacdougalTs followers,
but that he was now seeking another master.
Macdonald desired him to ask his master, when he
would see him, if the little black horse would
overtake the great red horse, for himself was black,
and Macdougall red-haired. Macdougall being
informed of this by the spy, left the country that
same night, but continued always to molest
Macdonald and the family of Ardnamurchan,
until the time of John, Lord of the Isles.” After
the forfeiture of Alexander of Lorn, Angus Oig was
rewarded with some of his lands. (See Robertson’s
Index, p. 2, Nos. 51, 52, 54.) Shortly before his
death he had become one of the most powerful
chiefs in the West.
1 This indenture was ratified by Edward at
Aukeland on sth October 1336. (See Rotuli
Scotiae, 1., p. 463.) John of Isla, unlike his father,
Angus Oig, had never been loyal to the house of
Bruce. This contract marks the definite allegiance
of John to Balliol, and his break with the later
traditions of his house. The phrase quantum in se
est would seem to imply that Balliol was not over
confident in his possession of the lands which he
conveyed to John.

[This] indenture made at the town of Perth, on Thursday 12th September, a.d. 1335,
between the most excellent Prince Edward, by the grace of God, King of Scots, on the
one part, and John of the Isles, on the other part, declares that the said Lord King has
surrendered, as far as is in his power, to the foresaid John for his good and praiseworthy
service done to him and to be done in the future by him and his heirs, the island of Ysle,
the land of Kentyre, the land of Knappedoll, the island of Gythe, the half of the island of
Dure, the island of Golwonche (Colonsay), the island of Mulle, the island of Sky, the island
of Lewethy (Lewis), the land of Kenalbadon and of Ardmurcon, to be held by the said John,
his heirs and assignees. The said Lord King has also granted to the same John the ward-
ship of Loghaber till the majority of the son and heirs of David of Strabolgy, last Earl of
AtholL For which foresaid conditions, however, the foresaid John of the Isles binds him-
self and his heirs to be liegemen and vassals of the said Lord King and his heirs for ever,
and himself, his friends, and his heirs, whomsoever, to pursue all his enemies and rebels,
whenever, wherever, and however he may. And, for guarantee of the faithful fulfilling
of all these promises, the said John shall swear upon the host, the altar chalice, and the
missal. Moreover, the said John is willing and grants that, if the foresaid Lord King wish
to have a hostage or hostages from him, for further security, his kinsman or his kinsmen
nearest in blood, being minors, shall be delivered up to the said Lord King when occasion
permits, because the said John has not yet a son or heir lawfully begotten of his body.
Further, the foresaid Lord King is willing and grants that whenever he has an heir legiti-
mately begotten of his body the said John shall be godfather to the said heir.

dominum Eegem Anglie.”

1 John of Isla, who had preferred to hold of
Balliol {ante, p. 12), was, on the restoration of
David 11. in 1341, deprived of his lands in Isla
and other parts ; and Angus Maolan, head of the
house of Ardnamurchan, received a charter for
some of them. (See Gregory’s History, p. 26,
where he refers to a charter in the Haddington
Collections, which the Editor has not been able to
identify.) The infeftment does not seem to have
been made, probably on account of the spirited
resistance offered by John and his friends.
David, being anxious to have a united kingdom
for the struggle with England, granted the above
charter to the rebel, who henceforth resisted all
English intrigues. Towards the end of the reign
John had become so negligent in the payment of his
taxes that David 11. was compelled to send a large
force against him. He capitulated at Inverness on
15thNovemberl369. (See the Articles of Submission
printed in the App. of Vol. 11. of Tytler’s History
and Robertson’s Index, p. 108, No. 27.) He is
known as “Good John of Isla,” probably on
account of his benefactions to the Church in the
Isles. We read in the Macvurich MS. that
“ho made donations to Icolumcille in his own
time, and it is he also that covered the chapel of
Elan Eorsay and the chapel of Elan Finlagan
. . , with all their appropriate instruments for
order and mass and the service of God, for the
better upholding of the monks and priests this
lord kept in his company.” Donald, his son and
successor, was also “an entertainer of clerics and
priests and monks in his companionship, and he
gave lands in Mull and in Isla to the monastery of
I, and every immunity which the monastery of I
and from his ancestors before him. ” (See Skene’s
Celtic Scotland, 111. App., p. 402.)

1 This charter was first brought under public
notice by the late Dr Reeves; Bishop of Down, in
a paper read to the Royal Irish Academy on 12th
January 1852 ( Proceedings , vol. v. p. 230). He
gave a transcript and translation, differing little
from the version and translation given above,
which appear among the Facsimiles of the National
MSS. (vol. ii. No. 59). “The name MacAodh,”
he says, signifies “ son of Hugh, and is pro-
nounced in Scotland, as well as the south of
Ireland, according to the provincial sound of the
syllable Aodh, Mackay; but in the middle of
Ireland, Mackew ; and in Ulster, Magee. The
family which bore it was akin to the Mac Don-
nells, and was commonly known as 1 Macgee
of the Rinns of Isla ’ ” (Of. Collect, de Fetus
Albanicis, p. 27). The Macdonald MS. mentions a
“Macgee of the Rinds of Isla ” among the followers
of Donald Ballooh in his engagement with the Earl
of Mar and Mackintosh [ibid., p. 310). “When
the MacDonnells sought a permanent footing in
Ireland, the Magees followed their fortunes, and
obtained a settlement on the north-east coast of
the county of Antrim. The tradition of the
family, as stated by John Magee, the owner of the
present document [1852], is, that his ancestor,
John Magee, w’ho was cousin to Somhairb Boy
Mao Donnell, came to Ireland with that chieftain
to assist him in wresting the Route and Glynns
from the MacQuillins ; and that, having rendered
important services to him at the battle of Aura, he
received, as a reward, the four quarter-lands of
Ballyukin, and two adjacent to Aura, in the parish
of Culfeightoine, which continued in the possession
of the family until the time of the present represen-,
tative’s grandfather.” Mr Hector Mac Lean, Bally-
grant, informs the Editor that the descendants of
Brian Vicar Mac Kay are still numerous in the island.
“There are,” he says, “ two forms of the surname
Mac Kay there —MaeAoidh and MaeAidh. The
former distinguishes the descendants of MacAoi na
Hanna, the representative of Brian Vicar Mac Kay
(Mac Kay of the Rhinns), who exchanged his lands
in the Oa for the Rhinns. South of the townland
of Nerrabus is Gleann MagAodh, a name which
commemorates MacAoi na Ranna.”
The document was ultimately purchased by the
Treasury, and deposited in the General Register
House. The family were loath to part with it,
believing that by it they might still assert their
right in the island. As they had kept it buried in
a box, it was rotten and nigh illegible when it
arrived in Edinburgh. It is now, thanks to Dr
Dickson’s care, in much better condition ; and,
though difficult to read without re-agents, is
sufficiently well preserved, especially in the sig.
natures, to make its reproduction practicable. The
accompanying illustration is an accurate facsimile
by photo-lithography without any manipulation of
the text. The letters within square brackets in the
printed text are supplied from an old transcript,
also preserved in the Register House. Mr Mac Lean
remarks that the Gaelic of this charter approximates
to that of South Kintyre rather than to present

sway of the Macdonalds there and in Kintyre
there were scarcely any dialectal differences between

In the name of God. Amen. I, Macdonald, am granting and giving eleven marks and

him for ever and ever, for his services . . 2 to myself and to my father before me;
and this on covenant and on condition that he himself and they shall give to mo, and to

brehon, the judge’s son, but has now assumed the
commonplace form of Brown. Fergus Macßeth is
believed to be one of the family of Macbeth or
Bethune, from time immemorial hereditary leeches
as weU as sennachies or chroniclers of the family
of the Isles . . . This very charter was probably
written by Fergus, for it will be observed that the
writing of it resembles that of his signature, and
that he subscribes his name without further desig-
nation, while the other witnesses subscribe by a
mark, each, however, using a different sign. Hugh
M c Kay, whose mark has some resemblance to the
figure of an ancient plough, though his name is
differently written from that of the grantee—nearly,
indeed, as now pronounced—was probably a kins-
man of his.” With regard to the name of the second
witness, Mr Hector Mac Lean informs the Editor
that the surname Brown was in his younger days
Maca’bhuithain, a corruption of Mam'bhrithinn,
i.e., son of the judge. “This name,” he says,
“ seems to correspond to the Irish surnames iPßreen,
and Macbrayne, which have the same meaning.
Brown is now Gaelicised, and was so in my
youngest days. Many of the name came to the
island from the Low Country within the past cen-
tury, and have no claim to be considered descendants
of the Brithcamh Ileach (the Isla Judge).” In 1618
a number of the Clan Breghoun were living in and
around Laggan (see the Band of Obedience to the
Laird of Calder of that date). Some interesting
documents relating to the Macbeths, the hereditary
leeches, are printed further over.
1 John Mor, or John the Tanister, second son of
John (the Good) of Isla, by his second marriage,
received from his brother Donald 120 merklands in
Kintyre, and 60 merklands in Isla as his share of
his father’s lands. By his marriage with Marjory
Bisset he added the lands of the Glens in Antrim.
In 1400 he is styled “Lord of Dunyvcg and the
Glens.” ( Botuli Scotiae 11., 155.) John Mor
seems not to have been content with his Scottish
share, and at the instigation of MacFinnon and
his kinsman, the Green Abbot Finnon (by whose
daughter he had a natural son called Ranald Bain,
founder of the House of Largy), quarrelled with his
brother. “Now John and his party could not
withstand the forces of his brother; so, leaving
Kintyre, he went to Galloway. Macdonald
follow'ed them. John went from Galloway to
Ireland, and remained in the Glens. Donald
returned to Isla. John More and his faction,
seeing that both they themselves and their interest
were like to bo lost, unless Macdonald pardoned
himself, and spared the rest for his sake, thought
it their best course to go to Isla, where Macdonald
resided in Killcummm. Upon John More’s coming
in his brother’s presence, and prostrating himself
on the ground, his brother rose and took him up
and embraced him kindly. . . , MacFinnon, being
found guilty and convicted, was hanged, and the
Abbot was all his lifetime confined at Icolumkill,
his life being spared, because he was a churchman ”
(Macdonald MS., Coll, dc rebus Alban., p. 303).
John Mor was the founder of the Clan lan Vor,
one of the most powerful branches of the family of
the Isles. His lands passed in succession to his son,
Sir Donald Balloch (1427), and to his son John.
surnamed Cathanach, who was head of the elan,
and held the foresaid lands in Isla at the date of
the final forfeiture of the Lordship of the Isles.,
The lands in Kintyre had been alienated in 1476.
“The Clan lan Vor was known also as Clandonald,
from its celebrated chief, Donald Balloch ; whilst,
to distinguish it from the race of Hugh of Sleat,
the appellation Clandonald South w r as employed.
The chiefs were usually styled Lords of Dunyveg
and the Glens” (See Gregory’s Highlands and
Islands, p. 63). For a notice of the house at Kil-
cummin, see Orig. Par. Scot. 11., 275.

in the Insurrection of 1461, refused to consent to
arrangement concerning the Lordship of the Isles.
He raised a faction, chiefly among the Clandonald,
against his father, and became involved in certain
feuds. The Macdonald Sennachy calls him “a
bold, forward man, and high-minded,” and in
justification relates a story of his conduct in
Isla towards his father, who “very much dimin-
ished his rents by his prodigality” (See Coll,
de reins Alban., p. 315). The success of his
assault on the Mackenzies forced the Crown to
give commissions against him to the Earls of

ultimately driven from Ross back to the Isles,
where he continued, despite the friendly endeavours
of the royal commissioners, to foment the strife
between his followers and those of his father,
which culminated in his victory at the battle
of the Bloody Bay near Tobermory. Some little
time after this conflict “the Earl of Athole,
being provided with boats by Argyll, crossed
over privately to Isla, where Angus Ogg’s lady,
daughter of Argyll, was, and apprehended Donald
Dubh, or “The Black,” a child of three years
of age, and committed him prisoner to Inch
Chonnil, . . where he remained in custody until
his hair got grey. Yet Angus Ogg, Donald
Dubh’s father, was still advised by the Earl of
Angus and Hamilton to hold out and maintain
his rights.” ( Macdonald MS., Colled, de rebus
Alban., p. 317.) Angus thereupon proceeded
to Athol in a warlike manner, and, breaking
sanctuary at the Chapel of St Bride, carried off
the Earl and Countess of Athol to Isla. The
Macdonald Sennachy quoted above denies the breach
of sanctuary, though he admits that “ his father’s
curse seems to have lighted on this man.” His
journey to Isla was very disastrous to him and his
followers ; and he became so superstitious as to its
meaning, that he liberated his prisoners, without
seeking the restoration of his son. The Macdonald
MS. says he kept them a year in the island. Angus
was ultimately murdered at Inverness, probably be-
fore the year 1490. (See Macdonald MS. in Collect,
de rebus Alban, passim ; Gregory’s Highlands and
Islands, p. 51, &e.) We have here an early indi-
cation of the interference of the Argyll family.
Further evidence as to the opposition of that
family, and of the Campbells of Calder, to the
Macdonalds and neighbouring islesmen, will appear
ere long.

Abstract.
James, &c. In our Parliament holden at Edinburgh on 27th November 1475, we decreed
certain processes of forfeiture against John of Isle, sometime Earl of Eoss and Lord of tho
Isles, for his acts of treason against us and our kingdom ; nevertheless, on account of the
urgent request of our dearest consort, Margaret, Queen of Scotland, and our Parliament now
sitting, we have restored, and by these presents do restore, our said cousin to his honours
and dignities and to his good fame, and altogether remove from him every mark of infamy
incurred by his said conduct. Moreover, calling to mind the near relationship of the said
John to us, and being unwilling to deprive him and his heirs of the lands and posses-
sions formerly held by him, we, with the consent of the Estates of our said Parliament, and
at the request of our said consort, have anew made, and by this present charter have created,
the said John a lord and baron of Parliament, to be called in all time coming Lord of the
Isles: and also have given and granted, and by the tenor of this charter do give and grant,

recover the Earldom of Ross, made by Alexander,
son of his brother Celestine, who had become his
heir by the death of his son John (named in
Charter of 1476) without issue. James IV., there-
after, resolved upon the final forfeiture of the
Lordship of the Isles. This was effected in the
Parliament hold in May 1493. (See Gregory’s
Highlands and Islands, p. 55.) The Act of
Forfeiture is not extant, hut the present charter
proves that it had been passed. The later history

XII. —CHARTER BY JANES IV. TO JOHN MAKKANE OF ARDNAMURCHANE

1 This charter, which is given here by
permission of the Duke of Argyll, has been fre-
quently referred to, notably by Gregory, but it
does not seem to have been printed. Its historical
interest, and the fact that it is not in the Eegister
of the Great Seal, warrant its appearance in
extenso.
2 This service, which is made a reason for further
grants to Makkane in Isla, was performed in the
island towards the end of 1494. “During the
time that Domhnall Dubh had been in custody
there was a great struggle among the Gaoidheal
for power, so that MaoCeaain of Ardnamurchan
almost destroyed the race of Eoin Mor, son of Eoin
of He and of Ceanntire. Eoin Cathanach, son of
Eoin, son of Domhnall Ballooh, son of Eoin llor,
son of Eoin, son of Aongus Og, Lord of the race of
Eoin Mor, and Eoin Mor, son of Eoin Cathanach,
and Eoin Og, son of Eoin Cathanach, and Domh-
nall Balloch, son of Eoin Cathanach, were treacher-
ously taken prisoners by MacCeain on the island
of Fionnlagan in lie; and he conveyed them to
Duneidin, and a gallows was erected for them at
that place which is called Baramuir, and they were
executed, and their bodies buried in the church of
Saint Francis, which is called Teampal Nua (New
Church) at this time. There were none left of the
children of Eoin Cathanach but Alasdair, son of
Eoin Cathanach, and Aongus Reach, who were
hiding in the Glens of Erinn.” {Macvurich MS.
in Celtic Scotland, iii. p. 404.) See also the Mac-
donald MS. {Coll, de Rebus Alban., p. 324), and
Treasurer’s Accounts (ed. Dickson), pp. 238-9.
The arrest and execution of the Isla men was a
punishment for the hanging of the governor of
Duuaverty in the sight of the King ; and Maolan
was chosen, by the advice of Argyll, to inflict it.
He was a kinsman, and at the time was at feud with
lan Cathanach concerning the lands of Sunart.
In the same year (1499) he received a charter
granting him the disputed lands in Ardnamurchan.

more able to do on account of the imprisonment
of Donald Dubh (see Gregory’s Highlands and

ANENT HIS SURRENDER.
A NENT the articulis and desiris proponit and gevin in be Sir Johnne

1 On I2th Nov. 1528 the Council passed an im-
portant act dealing with the Western Isles {Acta
Domin. Coneilii, xxxviii. f. 190). The King being
informed that “divers personis inhabitantis the
Ilys and ferme landis annexit and adjacent thairto,
quhilkis labouris privatlie for new infeftment, and
sum hes optenit new infeftmentis quhilkis may
retume to the gret scaith of his Hienes baith
anentis his propir landis and his casualiteis, with-
out the samyn be wisly considirit and forsene to
be for the wele of his Grace and realme,” the Lords,
therefore, ordain “that in tyme to cum na infeft-
mentis be maid to ony personis inhabitantis the
Ilis and ferme landis pertenand thairto hot be the
aviso of our Soverane Lordis Counsale and of
Colyne, Erie of Erglle, his louetenent in tha
pairtis . . . ; and siclike all new infeftmentis
laitlie past to be of nane avale.” One of the
results of this act was the insurrection of the
Clandonald of Isla, who were joined by the
Macleans in their attack on the lands of the Earl.
Matters soon became so serious that the Lieu-
tenant found it necessary to ask for fuller powers
from the Council. It is interesting to note, in the
document printed above, the further connection of
the Laird of Calder with the aifairs of the Western
Islands.

selves before the King and undertake to keep good
rule and pay their rents.
2 Archibald, Earl of Argyll, seems to have taken
ill the submission of Alexander of Isla, and to have
endeavoured to compromise him in the eyes of the
King. He accordingly preferred a number of charges
against him. King James, after the date of the
above statement, found occasion to summon the
Earl, and, having satisfied himself that the Earl’s
conduct was not disinterested, committed him to
prison. He was liberated shortly after, but he was
deprived of his offices in the Isles. Some of these
were given to Alexander of Isla. (See Gregory,
Highlands and Isles, p. 142; also, the State
Papers quoted there).

to remane in this tonne to ansuer to his complaynt. And I have remanit
heir continualy thir xiiij dayis last bipast daly to ansuer to his said bill;
and, becaus he perfitlie knawis that his narratioun is not nor may not
be previt of verite, he absentis him, and bydis away, and will not cum to
follow the same. And sen sa is that his narracioun is all wranguis and
feynyeit maid upoun' me without ony fait of verray malice as said is, as
manifestly apperis, becaus he will not cum to persew and verify the
samin, I ansuer to the poyntis of his bill in this wis.—ln the first, I
understand that na persoun hes jurisdictioun of the Lordschip of the Ills
bot my maister the Kingis Graice alanerly. And, insafer as his Hienes
gaif command and power to my sympilnes at my first incuming to his
Graice at Striveling, 1 I haif oheyit and done his Hienes commandis in
all poyntis and fulfillit the tenour of all his actis maid in Striveling in
every poynt, as I wes commandit. And, gif it pleis his Graice to com-
mand me to gif his malis and dewiteis of his landis and Lordschip of the
Ylis to ony persoun, the samyn salbe done thankfully eftir my power.
And, insafer as the said Erie allegit that I did wrang in intrometting and
uptaking of the malis and dewiteis of the His, he failyeit thairin, becaus
I did nathing in that behalf bot as I wes commandit be the Kingis Graice,

Forther, my Lordis, I at your Lordschipis command hes remanit in
this tounc thir dayis last bipast dalie reddy to ansuer to the said Erie in
ony thing he had to lay to my charge to my greit coist and expensis.
He, as I am informit, is past in the Ilis with all the folkis that he may
gett and with all the men that the Erie of Murray may caus pas with
him for heirschip and distructioun of the Kingis Grace landis of the Ilis,
and for slauchter of his pouer liegis duelland thairin; quhilk, as I traist,
is done without his Graces avise, licence, auctorite, or consent. And, gif
sa be, the hale fait is maid to his Hienes, considering baith the land and
the men and the inhabitaris thairof ar his awne; -and wele it is to be
presumit that his Graice wald gif na command to distroy his awne men
and landis.

And, gif the Kingis Graice, my soverane lord and maister, will gif
power or command to me or ony utlier gentilman of the Ilis that his
Hienes will gif credence to rais the men of the Ilis to cum to his
Hienes to pas in Ingland in oisting or ony uther pairte in the mayn-
land within this realme, I sail mak gude we sail bring mair gude
fechtand men to do his Grace honour, plesour, and service na the said
Erie sail do.
And, gif the said Erie will contempne the Kingis Graces auctorite,
his Hienes gevand command to me and his pouer liegis of the Ilis,
we sail caus and compell the said Erie to duell in ane uthir parte of
Scotland nor in Ergile, quhair the Kingis Grace may gett ressoun of
him.
And, further, thair is na persoun in the Ilis that hes offendit to the
said Erie or ony utheris in the Law! and hot I sail caus him cum to the
Kingis Grace to underly his lawis and to pleis his Hienes and the pairty

simulatioun.
And, further, my Lordis I have fulfillit your Lordschipis command
and bidden ay in this towne and kepit the day that your Lordschipis

On 13th Oct. 1539, 8 Flanders bows and 4 Scottish
bows, at 8s each, were sent by the King to Allan,
brother of Maclean of Dowart. These entries are
interesting, not only because they throw light on
the relations of James V. to his island liegemen,
but also because they emphasise the reputation
of the western archers. In the “roll” of soldiers
shipped at Loch Kilcherran, 11th to 28th Dec.
1627, under Alexander M c Nachtane for service in
the French war, there is a number of names of
archers, many of whom in all probability hailed
from Isla. —See the Morton Papers and Gregory’s
paper in Arch. Scotica, iii. p. 254.
1 The MS. reads “ the yle of Ylay and Yley.”

Abstract.
James, &c.—Know, because we, having completed our twenty-fifth year, and issued our
general revocation, are surely informed that the following lands belonged hereditarily to
the late Hector M'Clane, grandfather of Hector M c Clane, senior, at the time of his decease,
and that charters, instruments of sasine, and other evidents of the same by which his heirs
should have entry to the same were burned and destroyed by the late Angus, Earl, chief
of the Isles 1 , at the time of the deadly feud between him and the foresaid late
Hector, so that the late Lauchlan M'Clano, son and heir of the foresaid late Hector
M'Clane, could not at all obtain heritable entry, &c. thereof, as heir to the said Hector,
but that the said lands have from his death remained always in our hands, we, neverthe-
less, by no means wishing that the foresaid Hector M'Clane, son of the foresaid Lauchlan
and grandson of the said Hector, and his heirs should be disinherited through the loss of
the foresaid evidents concerning the foresaid lands, but with deliberate intention to secure
l An explanation of the vagueness of Angus’s
title will be found in the history of the events
referred to in the footnotes on pp. 21 and 25. One
of the charges preferred by him against his father
was the gift of lands to the Macleans and others
{see Gregory’s Highlands and Isles, p. 51).
G


them in the same for the good service done and to be done to us by them, have by our free
will and royal authority granted anew to the said Hector M c Clane of Howard in liferent and
to Hector M'Clane, his son and heir-apparent, [certain] lands in the island of Mull, together
with the .£2O, 6s. Bd. lands of old extent following, —viz.: the quarter land of Schynnerll,
the quarter land of Cowll, the quarter land of Arehallich and Borland, the quarter land of
Corspellane, the quarter land of Garrynsay and Kylnalen, the quarter land of Garbols and
Dowach, the quarter land of Hall, the quarter land of Robols and Kepols, the quarter land
of Skanlastill, the quarter land of Killelegan and Skanlastill, the half of an eighth part of
the lands of Meglyne, the half of an eighth part of the lands of Owo, an eighth part of
the lands of Bols, and the 6s. Bd. lands of Skanlastill, with mills, &c. of all the forcsaid
lands, lying in the island of Islay. Moreover, we confirm all right, title, &c. in the same,
which we, our ancestors or our successors may have, to the foresaid Hector M'Clane, junior,
and his heirs named in a charter of tailie granted by us to him of the lands and barony of
Howard [despite all claims on account of the forfeiture of the Lord of the Isles, or any
escheat, alienation, bastardy, or neglect of service] : To bo holden in fee in time coming
to the said Hector, senior, in liferent, and his said son and his heirs as in the said charter
of tailie, as parts of the said barony. In witness whereof, &c. At Falkland, 12th November
1542, and the thirtieth year of our reign.

Abstract.
Mary, &c.—Know, whereas our letters, hy advice of the Lords of our Council, were
directed to William Hardy, messenger, our sheriff in that part, declaring that, whereas
the said Lords have ordained letters to be directed to distrain the moveable goods on the
ground of the twenty pound lands of Geya, the 16 marklands in Kyntire, and the 5 marklands
lying in Ylay, called Knokrenissale, Ardarracht, Ardalesne, and Argare, from the Mull to
Alta-Synnooh, for the past dues of the same, annually for the space of the last 60
years or thereby, and, in the event of the failure of the said moveables, to distrain the land
for the said ferms, &c., to the amount underwritten, and to cause Hector Makclane,
natural son of the late Alan M'Clanc, brother of Hector Makclane of Dowart, and the
said Hector, his curator, for his interest, to be paid, according to the gift of non-entry of
the said Hector granted formerly, for the said lands and five marklands of Islay during the
H


said period, annually, 60 stones of cheese called caschenauuif, in equal halves of meal and
cheese, 8 marts, 8 carcases of mutton, 8 geese, and 8 fowls, the price of each boll of barley
annually before the death of our dearest father being 2 marks, and after his decease 3
marks, the price of a stone of cheese 4s, a stone of meal 3s, a mart 345, each sheep ss, a
goose 12d, a fowl 4d On 29th May following 1 our said sheriff appeared at the
market cross of Terbert, and there caused the court to be lawfully constituted, and Neill
MacNele, the alleged possessor of the foresaid lands, and all others having interest to be
summoned to appear before him, and to hear the foresaid lands lawfully apprised for the
said Hector and his said curator by Mr Archibald Makgilwray of Kilcomman, their pro-
curator. The said Archibald appeared and produced to the assize certain letters of gift of
non-entry, ferms, &c., of the said lands to the said Hector Makclane, natural son of the late
Alane (ante, p. 53), together with a certain decree of the Lords of Council declaring the
said lands to be in our hands since the decease of the late Malcolm Maknele, alleged
possessor of the same, by reason of non-entry for the space of 60 years, and ordaining the
ferms, &c. to belong to us and the said Hector, our donator; also, another Council decree
of liquidation of the annual value and profits of the same. And the assize, having con-
sidered the matter with care, apprised the said lands in Islay which had yielded in dues,
&c., annually, during the said time, the sum of £37, 2s Bd, or with the dues of the other
lands £237, 17s Bd, for the sum of £16,611, 18s 4d, and gave £B4O, 2s 10d as fee to
our said sheriff for the apprising; and they found that the said lands are held of us by
service of ward and relief: We therefore have given and granted &c. all and each the said
lands &c., to be held to Hector Makclane, his heirs and assignees, of us and our successors
in fee and heritage for ever, as the foresaid Neill Maknele or his predecessors held or
possessed them before the said apprising; the foresaid Hector, &c., rendering to us and
our successors the rights and services of the said lands with their pertinents, as by custom
before the said apprising. And, despite this our infeftment, we will and grant &c., that
the said Neill Maknele &c. shall have full and free right of ingress and egress in and to
the said apprised lands, whenever he or they shall pay to the said Hector the foresaid sums
for which they were apprised, provided that he or they shall make payment within 7
days for the ferms, &c. of the said lands to be possessed meanwhile by the said Hector,
&c., in payment of the said principal sum and of the expenses of our infeftment, which
we will to be rated at the lowest, as by Act of Parliament ordained. In witness whereof,
&c. At Edinburgh, 23d June 1553, and the 11th year of our reign.

of the Macdonndls of Antrim (p. 45), suggests that
Macdonald’s writs had been destroyed at his house
of Saddell by the Irish Deputy during his raid in
the West. The date of Sussex’s expedition was,
however, some months later than the present
grant. See p. 66.

Abstract.
Francis and Mary, by the grace of God King and Queen of Scots, Dauphin and
Dauphiness, &c. Know that we, understanding that our loved Janies M'Connell of
Dunnyveig and Glennis and his predecessors have enjoyed all and each the lands, &c.
underwritten, with their pertinents, and that they have been in possession of the same
from time beyond memory of man; and that all their ancient evidents, charters, precepts,
instruments of sasine, and other writs are burned, destroyed, and lost by war and other
causes; wherefore, and for the good, faithful, and free service done and to be done to us
and our kingdom of Scotland by the said James M'Connell against our old enemies of
England in the defence of our said kingdom and its liberties, as well within the same as in
Ireland, willing that the said James shall by no means be disinherited from the said lands or
in any manner suffer scathe in them or in any part of them, but rather that he and hislieirs
underwritten shall be made sure in the same in all time coming,—have given and granted,
&c., to the foresaid James M'Connell and his heirs withinnamed and his assignees [certain]
lands in South and North Kintyre, in Colonsay, in Jura, and in Islay. [lt will be noted
that the list of Islay lands is as in the earlier charter (ante, p. 50), with the addition of the
\6s SOtlands of Kilcallumkill.'] Moreover, for the foresaid reasons, we grant, &c. to the
said James M'Connell, his heirs, &c., all the said lands, &c., together with all right, title, &c.
which we, our predecessors, or our successors have, &c., in or to the said lands, or any part of
them, the ferms, profits, and dues of the same of whatever years and terms bygone by reason
of the forfeiture of the late John, Lord of the Isles, &c., renouncing the same in favour of the

2 This is an early indication of a serious feud
between the Clandonald and Clanlean. We have
already referred to a quarrel between one section of
the Clandonald under Angus of Isla and Maclean
of Duart about a century before this date {ante, p.
49). “Of the early details of the feud,” says


probatioun, writtis, and documentis as athir of tbame will use, for preving
of the richt, titill, interes, and clame of rycht quhilk thai pretend to haif

XXXV.— DECREE BY THE PRIVY COUNCIL, ALLOWING THE CLAIM OF
JAMES MACDONALD OF DUNIVAIG TO THE RINNS OF ISLAY.

Secreit Counsall, understanding how in the moneth of Julij last

versie standand betuix thame for the rycht and kyndes of the landis of
the Rynnis in Hay, the mater wes than continewit to Sanctandrois day
thaireftir following, and bayth the partis commandit to compeir personalie

instant, and the parteis commandit to compeir personalie; nevirtheles
the said Hector hes nawyise comperit bot be his writtingis hes excusit
him, allegeand himself unabill to travell be ressoun of his infirmitie.
The Lordis of Secreit Counsall, in respect of the comperance of the said
Gregory (p. 191), “which was aggravated by
previous disputes regarding the island of Gigha,
little is found in the usual sources of information.
The isles of Mull, Tiree, and Coll were invaded by
the Clandonald of Isla, assisted by its kindred tribe,
the Clandonald of Sleat (Reg. of Privy Seal, xxxi.
f. 48); and it may be supposed that the Macleans
and their allies were not backward in similar
hostilities.” As to the disputed rights in Islay,
see the extract from Sir Robert Gordon’s History
on p. 79.


James M c Conill, defendar, qulia producit divers witnesis, as said is, and
wes reddie all utherwyise to mak cleir probatioun of bis kyndnes to the
saidis landis of the Eynnis of Hay, decernis that the said Hector M°Clanis
clame and persute of the saidis landis sail ceis unto the tyme that the
said James be lauchfullie warnit agane and his ressonabill expensis, to

and declaratioun sail serve for a plane condempnatour gevin aganis him,
annulland his rycht and kyndnes to the saidis landis of the Eynnis of
Day, and he sail nevir be hard to move actioun, questioun, or pley thair-
foir in tyme cuming.

XLV.— NARRATIVE OF THE FEUD BETWEEN THE CLANDONALD AND THE
CLANLEAN AND OF THE EVENTS WHICH CAME TO PASS IN THE
ISLAND OF ISLAY.
A fourth commotion 2 wes in the Western Yles in Scotland, which did
thus aryse and happen betueen Angus Mackdonald of Kintyre and
Sir Laughlan Macklain of Duart in Mull, whose sister the said Angus had
mareid. This warr, which fell furth at this tyme betueen these two races
of people (the Clandonald and the Clanlain), wes prosecuted to the
destruction almost of both their families,
Donald Gorme Mackonald of Slait, trawelling from the yle of Sky
to visit his cousin, Angus Mackonald of Kintyre, landed with his
train in ane yland called Juray or Duray, which pairtlie apperteyned
to Angus Mackonald, and pairtlie to Sir Laghlan Macklain. And, by
chance, he fortuned to land in that pairt of the yland which apperteneth
to Macklain, being driven in thither by contrary winds; wher they were
no sooner on shear, hot Mackonald Tearreagh and Houcheon Mackgillespick 4
(tuo of the Clandonald who had latelie fallen out with Donald Gorme)
arryved their also with a company of men. And, vnderstanding that
Donald Gorme wes their, they secreitlie took away by night a number of
1 An order is given on the same day to Lauohlan
Maclean of Duart and others to appear before
the Council to answer “tuitcheing the gude reull
and quietnes of the Ilis and Hielandis,” under
pain of rebellion.
2 Sir Robert Gordon has been describing other
feuds in the kingdom which were as “a popular
seiknes and infection through all the land,” the
people “finding the king young, and his officers so
sleughfull and negligent in their function.”

cattell out of that pairt of the iland which apperteaned to Macklain ; and
so they retire agane to the sea, thinking therby to stur vp a tumult in the
iland against Donald Gorme, by making the Clanlain to beleive that this
wes done by Donald Gorme his men, which fell out accordinglie. For
Donald Gorme and his company, lying at a place in the iland called Inver-
chuockwrick, 1 wer suddently invaded vnawars vnder silence of the night
(neither suspecting nor expecting any such interteynment) by Sir
Laughlane Macklain and his tryb the Macklain, who had assembled ther
whole forces againes them. Macklain killed that night about thriescore
of the Clandonald. Donald Gorme himselff escaped by going that night
to sleip in a ship that lay in the harbor. Heirvpon, ther arose great
troubles betuein the Clandonald and the Clanlain, which did not end
vntill the death of this Sir Laghlane Macklain, who wes slain afterward
by Sir James Mackonald, his owne sister’s sone, and the sone of the forsaid
Angus, the yeir of God 1598.
Angus Mackonald hearing of this lamentable accident which happened
betuein his brother-in-law, Sir Laghlan Macklain, and his cousen Gorme,
he taketh journey into the Yle of Sky, to visite Donald Gorme, and tosie
by what meanes he could work a reconciliatioun betuein him and Macklain
for the slaughter of Donald Gorme his men at Inver-Chuoack-wrick.
After that Angus had remained a whyle in the Sky with his cousen, he
taketh journey homeward into Kintyre ; and in his return, he landed in
the Yle of Mule, and went to the castle of Duart, Macklain his principall
duelling in Mulle, against the advyse and opinion of his tuo brethren, Coll
Mack-James and Reynald Mack-James, and of his cowsen, Reynald Mack-
Coil, who did earnestlie persuad him to the contrarie, desireing him to
send some gentleman of his train vnto Macklain, to declare vnto him how
he had sped with his cousen Donald Gorme, and how far he wes inclyned
to a reconciliation vpon a reasonable satisfaction. Bot Angus trusted so
much to his brother-in-law, Sir Laghlan Macklain, that he wold not
hearken vnto ther councell; whervpon his tuo brethren left him. Bot his
cousen, Renald Mack-coil, accompanied him to Duart, wher Angus and all
his company wer perfidiously taken prissoners by Sir Laghlan Macklain,
1 Innir-Chnoohd-Breachd. —Account of the Clan Maclean, p. 50.


the nixt day after ther arry vail, Eenald-Mack-coll only escaping, and that
verie hardlie. Angus wes deteyned their in captivitie vntill he did yeild
to renunce his right and title to the Einnes of the yle of Yla, which
properly apperteyned to the Clandonald, and had been by them given in
possession to the Clanlain for ther person all service. Angus wes forced to
condiscend vnto all Macklane his demands, or els their to end his dayes.
And, for performance of what wes desired, Angus wes vrged to give his
eldest sone, James Mackonald, and his brother, Eenald Mack-James, to
remain as pledges at Duart vntill Macklain should get the title of the
Einnes of Ila maid over vnto him. And so the pledges being delyvered,
Angus had his libertie.
Angus Mackonald receaveing this wrong at Sir Laughlan Macklain his
hands besyd that which his cousen Donald Gorme had befor receaved at
Inwer-Chuock-wrick, he went about by all meanes to revenge the same ;
and the better to bring his purposed revenge to passe, he vseth a policie,
by way of invitation, which happened thus. Macklain haveing gottin the
tuo pledges into his possession, he taketh journey into Ila to get per-
formance of w T hat wes promised vnto him by Angus Mackonald. He
leaveth Eenold Mack-James one of the pledges, fettered in prisson in his
castell of Duart, and careith James Mackonald, the other pledge, along
with him in his voyage. Being arryved in the ile of Yla, he encamped at
Ellan-Logh-Gorme, a ruynous castle, lying vpon the Einnes of Yla, which
fort wes then latelie in the possession of the Clanlain. Thervpon Angus
Mackonald took occasion to invite Sir Laghlane Macklain to come to
Mullintrea or Mullindhrea (a duelling-place which Angus had in the yle
of Yla, weill furnished), seing he wes better provyded ther of all kynd of
provision then Macklain culd be. Bot their wes so litle trust on either
syd, that they did not now meit in freindship or amitie, bot vpon ther
owne guard, or rather by messingers one from another. And true it is
(sayeth John Colwin, in his manuscript) 1 that the ilanders are of nature
verie suspicious, full of invention against ther nighbours by whatsoever
way they may get them destroyed. Besyds this, they are bent and eager
1 See p. 86, n.
L


in taking revenge, that neither have they regaird to persone, tyme, aige,
nor cause, and ar generallie so addicted that way, as lykwise are the most
pairt of all Highlanders, that therein they surpasse all other people what-
soever.
Angus Mackonald, as I have said, meditating perpetuallie vpon revenge,
which wes ingendered with such rancour in his heart, that he pretermitted
no invention how he might compasse Macklain his overthrow, sendeth to
Macklain, intreating him earnestlie to come vnto him to Mullintrea ; that
he should be so welcome as he culd mak him; that they should mak merrie
so long as his provision culd last, and, when that wer done and spent, he
should goe with him to his camp. For this custome also the ylanders
have, that, when one is invited to another’s hous, they never depairt so
long as any provision doth last; and, when that is done, they goe to the
nixt, and so from one to one vntill they mak a round from nighbour to
nighbour, still careing the maister of the former familie with them to the
nixt house. Macklain his ansuer to Angus his messinger wes, that he durst
not adventur to goe vnto him for mistrust. Angus then replyed that he
neided not mistrust, seing he had his sone and his brother alreadie pledges,
whom his freinds might retain in ther custodie vntill his returne ; and
that, for his owne pairt, he did intend nothing bot to continue in all
brotherlie love and affection towards him. Then SirLaughlane Macklain
seemed to be voyd of all suspition, and resolveth to goe vnto Angus his
hous. He careid with him James Mackonald, the pledge, his owne
nephue and the sone of Angus, whom he keiped alwise in his own sight,
thereby to save himselff from danger, iff any injurie should be offered vnto
him. To conclude, he came to Mullintrea, accompanied with four-score
and six of his kinsfolks and servants, in the moneth of Julie 1586 yeirs;
wher, at their first arryvall, they were maid welcome with all courtesie,
and sumptuouslie banquetted all that day. Bot Angus, in the meantyme,
had premonished all his freinds and weillwillers within the yle of Yla to
be at his house the same night at nyne of the clock, for he had concluded
with himselff the verie first night of ther arryvall. So Macklain, being
lodged with all his men in a long house that wes somewhat distant from


other houses, took to bed with him his nephue James, the pledge befor-
mentioned, with whome he never pairted. Bot within one hour therefter,
when Angus had assembled his men, to the number of thrie or four
hundred, he placed them all in order about the house wher Macklainthen
lay. Angus himselff came and called vpon Macklain at the dore, offerring
him his reposing drink, which wes forgottin to be given him befor he went
to bed. Macklain ansuered that he desired non e for that tyme. ‘ Although,’
sayeth Angus, ‘it be so, yit it is my will that thou aryse to come furth
to receive it.’ Then began Macklain to apprehend his danger, and so did
aryse with the pledge James betuein his shoulders, thinking that, iff
present killing wer intended against him, he wold save himselff so long as
he culd with the boy; who, seing his father Angus with a naked suord,
and a number of his men in lyk maner about him, cryed with a loud
voyce for mercy to his vnele Macklain, which wes granted; and Macklain
wes presentlie removed to a secreit chamber till the nixt morning. Then
Angus called to the remanent within, so many as wold have their owne
lyves to be saved, that they should come furth, Mackonald Terreagh and
another, whom he named, onlie excepted. Obedience wes maid by all
the rest; and these tuo, fearing the danger, refused to come furth; which
Angus perceaveing commanded incontinent to put fyre into the house;
which wes done, wher the tuo men wer pitifullie brunt to death. This
Mackonald Terreagh wes one of the Clandonald of the north-west iles, and
wes not onlie ane assister of the Clanlain against his owne tryb, bot also
wes the beginner of all these trubles ; the other wes a verie neir kinsman
to Macklain, 1 and of the oldest amongst the Clanlain, renouned both for
counsell and manhead.
After that the report of Sir Laughlane Macklane his taking came to the
ile of Mulle, Allane Macklain and some others of the tryb of Macklain
caused a fals rumor to be spred in the ile of Ila, that Renald Mack-James,
the other pledge which Angus Mackonald had given to Macklain, wes
killed at Duart in Mulle by Macklain his freinds ; which report wes raised
by Allane Macklain, that therby Angus might be moved to kill his

prissoner, Sir Laghlane Macklain,' and so Allans himselff might
succeed to his place and possessions, being the neirest in lyne to him
nixt his children, who wer verie young as yit. And indeid it wrought
this effect, that how soon the report of Kenald his death wes heard by
the Clandonald in Ila, the prissoners wer pitifullie used; for Macklain his
freinds and followers wer by coupls beheaded the dayes following by
Coil-Mack-James, the brother of Angus Mackonald. Bot Macklain
wes preserved alyve, and escaped at this tyme, being destinyed to end
his dayes afterward in the same island in a conflict betuein him and
James Mackonald, the sone of Angus, the pledge befor-mentioned, and
Sir Laghlane his owne sister’s sone, as, God willing, shall be shewen at
lenth. 1 . . .
The report of this fact at Mullintrea wes careid to the Earle of Argyle,
who immediatlie assembled his freinds to get Macklain out of Angus
Mackonald his power; bot, perceaveing that they wer not able to doe it
either by force or fair meanes, they thought necessar to complain to the
King. His Majestie directed charges and summonds to Angus Mackonald
by a herald at armes, commanding him to restore Macklain into the hands
of the Earle of Argyle ; bot the messinger wes interrupted, and the haven
stopped wher he should have taken shipping toward Yla, and so returned
home. Yit, with exceiding travell maid by the freinds of Argyle, and
many strick conditions granted by Macklain to Angus, Macklain wes at
last exchanged for Reynald Mack-James, the brother of Angus and pledge
aforsaid. And, for performance of such conditions as Macklain promised
vnto Angus at his releasment, he gave his owne sone and the sone of
Mack-cloyd of Herres, with divers other pledges, to Angus Mackonald;
who thervpon went into Ireland, vpon some occasion, to visite his cousens
the Clandonald of the Glenns in Ireland; which Macklain vnderstanding,
he invaded Ila, and brunt a great pairt of the same, and pursued those
who were at his taking with Angus, regarding neither the saiftie of the
pledges which he had given to Angus, nor his faith given in the presence
of the freinds at his delyverance.
1 See the account dated August 1598.


Angus Mackonald, returning out of Ireland, wold not stur the pledges,
who wer innocent of what wes done in his absence. 1 Yit, with a great
preparation of men and shipping, he went into the yles of Mulle and
Tirhie, invading these places with great hostilitie; wher, what by fyre,
what by suord, and what by water, he destroyed all the men that he
culd overtak, and all sort of heists that served for domesticall use and
pleasure of man, and finallie came to the verie Bin-More in Mulle, 2 and
ther killed and chased the Clanlain at his pleasure; and so revenged him-
selff fullie of the former injuries which wer done to him and to his tryb.
Whilst Angus Mackonald wes thus ranging in Mulle and Tirhie, Sir
Laglane Maklayn went into Kyntyre, who spoilled, wasted, and brunt a
great pairt of that cuntrey ; and thus for a whyle they did continuallie
vex one another with slaughters and outrages, to the destruction almost
of their cuntries and people. . . .
It is a certane rule that a fault growes greater by oversight and for-
givenes; for iff transgressors be punished in due tyme, the prince doth not
onlie his duetie in executing of justice to the great contentment of the
offended persone and good exemple to posteritie, as a mirror of his good
lyff, bot also he gives a terror to all offenders to behave themselves weill
for fear of vigorous punishment. It is better for a commounwealth to
have few lawes weill keipt than to have many good lawes evill executed
and farr worse obeyed. I have told yow at lenth the proceedings of these
ylanders, who efter this wer written for by the King, and subtillie trained
vnto Edinburgh the yeir of God 1591, and wer committed both to ward
within the Castell of Edinburgh, wher the King, according to equitie,
reasone, justice, and good policie, should have put them to a tryall, and
have them convicted for such crymes committed by them both against the
law of God and man. They wer, notwithstanding, remitted frie to passe

tion of Macdonald’s absence in Ireland. Maclean
and his allies, it is said, proceeded to Isla, slew “all
the men capable of bearing arms belonging to the
Clandonald in Isla,” and compelled Macdonald to
seek shelter in Dunaomabhaig (Dunivaig). Maclean
raised the siege on the intercession of his sister, the
wife of his enemy, and retired on obtaining a grant
of “the one-half of Isla” (pp. 58-9).

1 An interesting companion-account will be found
in the Historic and Life of King James the Aczi (Bann.
Club, pp. 217-222) written a few years before Sir
Robert Gordon’s Genealogy, by John Colville or
Colvin (1542 1-1605), referred to on p. 81. Internal
evidence shows that Sir Robert must have had the
Historic before him when hewas compiling his book,
though he has not followed it in its partisanship with
the Clan Maclean. His account, moreover, is fuller,
more specific in its details, and, from what we know’
from other sources, much more reliable. In the
Historic Maclean is said to visit Macdonald in
Kintyre, instead of Islay ; and no reference is made
to the dispute about the Rinns. Gordon’s details
are quite in agreementwith the evidence of the Privy
Council Records. During that visit, Maclean,
according to the Historic, was accompanied by 45
clansmen. The escape of Maclean is thus
described (p. 221), —“And when the day came that
Maclayne sould have bene brocht furth, miserablie
to have maid his tragicall end, lyk unto the rest, it
pleasit Angus to lowp upon his horse, and to cum
furth for joy and contentatioun of mynd, evin to
se and behauld the tyrannicall fact with his awin
eyis. Bot it pleasit God, wha mearcifullie deilis
with all man and disappoyntis the decrees of the
wicked, to disapoynt the intent for that day also,
for he was not sa sone on horse, bot the horse
stumhlit, and Angus fell of him and hrak his leg,
and so was careit hayme.”
Reference has been made in previous footnotes to
the Account of the Clan Maclean, by a Sennachie,
London, 1838. The story of the feud is professedly
that found in certain MSS. at Duart Castle. It
agrees in the main with the version given above ;
its points of difference, excluding statements of
obvious partisanship, are chiefly those of the
Historic.
Spotswood has closely followed the Historic
in his account of the fend. “Macklain,” he
says, “by his education on the Continent had
learned civility and good manners, and living
aocordinglie was in great respect both with his own
people and all his neighbours about. Mackoneil
out of an emulation made many quarrels to the
other, and in end laid a plot to murther him”

1 The holla majoris mensure or large boll was
used in the Isles at no distant period. It con-
tained five firlots ; while the small boll or 101 l heag
contained only three firlots. When rents were paid
by the latter measure, the tenant added by custom
a crear or two pecks to each 101 l heag. — Colled,

Abstract.
James, &c. Whereas, being informed that, on account of the deadly feud long since begun
and carried on between Angus M c Dowgall (M c Coneill) of Donyveg and his friends, and
Lauchlan M'Clane of Dovert and his friends, many great acts of rapine, murder, fire-raising,
and oppression have been committed on each side, therefore of our special grace, &c., we
remit to the said Angus M c Coneill of Dunyveg, Donald Gorum of Slait, Eannald M c Conneill
of Sinyrhie, brother of the said Angus, Coll M c Conneill, his brother, Archibald M c Konneill of
Macherireauch, Archibald M c Conneill of Rowinefellin, Alexander alias Allaster M°Allaster

1 A similar remission was passed on 20th March
1588-9 in favour of the above-mentioned Lauchlan
Maclean of Duart and his friends for their part in
the lawless proceedings in the West, notably for the
assault and burning of the islands of Rum, Canna,
and Eig, and the slaughter of John Angus, son of
Mr John Angus, John Mahane, and other islesmen
in November proceeding, but with a certain reserva-
tion, in these words :—‘ ‘ proditoria traditione in per-
onam S. D. N. Regis, arte parte eonsilio proditorie
combustionis et sufilationis sulphuric pulvero
Hispanice navis, hominum et provisionis in eadem
existentium apud insulam de Mull in meuse [blank)
ultimo elapso perpetratis tantummodo exceptis”
[Register of the Privy Seal, lix. f. 87, a).
These are the remissions referred to by Sir
Robert Gordon in the passage printed ante, p. 85,
and also in the Historic of King James the Sext, p.
222. The chiefs went to Edinburgh on the strength
of the acts of pardon, but were imprisoned for
a time in the Castle. That the Council may have
meditated some such subtle course, —in the case of
Maclean at least, —seems obvious from the reserva-
tions in the remission just quoted, for the offences
there named were brought into prominence at
the trial January 1590-1 (see next document).
The Crown was hard pressed for money, and
chose this dishonourable course as a means to
obtain it.


of Eist, and their kin and friends, all rancour, pursuit, and action which we may have con-
ceived or may have against them for whatsoever slaughters, &c., committed hy them against
the said Lauchlan M'Clane of Dovart or any of his kin or friendship in time past, and for
all crimes and actions which may follow thereupon or may be imputed to them or any of
them; and also for all actions and crimes heretofore committed by the foresaid Angus and
his kin and friends. At Halieruidhous, 26th March 1588, and the 21st year of our reign.

DONALD GORME FOR THEIR OBEDIENCE AND PAYMENT OF THEIR
RENTS.
r pHE charge re-narrates the dealings with Angus M'Coneill and
Donald M c Coneill Gorme of Slaitt since their release from Edin-
burgh Castle and the conditions imposed upon them, refers to the
1 On sth June 1592, an act was passed “ anent the
inohedience of personis possessouris of the Kingis
propre lands of the Hielandis and Ills,” whereby
Angus Macdonald of Dunivaig and Glens and
Lauchlan Maclean of Duart wereordered to give their
obedience personally before Ist August following,
otherwise it should be lawful for his Majesty to pro-
nounce his will against them, to wit, “the foir-
faltour of thair lilfis, landis, and guidis, and to exe-
cute thairplegis to the death,” because “of thair lait
avowit contempt and inobedience.” —Acts of Parlia-
ment, iii. p. 561.


Act of Parliament passed after their non-compliance (ante, p. 96, n.),
and concludes by ordering the issue of letters “ chargeing the saidis

1 On 13th January 1591-2 a bond of friendship
was arranged between John Campbell of Calder
and Angus Macdonald of Dunivaig, “ having
respect to the auld frendship of bluid and kynd-
nes euir betuix our housis and maist speciallio be-
tuix our selfis to this present, and at the plesour
of God to continew amangis us for our tymis, and
ane remembrance to our posteretie to continew in
the sam.” They are to maintain and assist each
other against all, the King and the Earl of Ergyll
alone excepted ( Cawdor Charter Chest ; Thanes of
Cawdor , p. 191). Calder had bought the island of
Gighafrom Angus in 1590 (ibid.).
2 See an interesting letter to Calder from James
Wardlaw, his law-agent in Edinburgh, concerning
his promise anent Angus Macdonald and Donald
Gorme (Thanes of Cawdor, pp. 194-5).
3 The registered act of surety will be found in
fall in the Denmylne MSS. (34. 2. 17) if. 2, 3. It
is signed by Angus Macdonald, Donald Gorme, and
John Campbell. Mr James Wardlaw, advocate,
who is a witness to the signature, is empowered to
appear as procurator and to seek registration.
Another copy is preserved in the same volume
(ff. 145-6). The act of surety for Lauchlan
Maclean “for payment of the mails of his proper
landis in the Ilis” will be found on f. 142. The
act of Council was ratified by Parliament in Juno
following, and an act of forfeiture was passed in
1594 (Hist, of James the Sext, p. 330); but the
chiefs remained restless, on account of the Irish
troubles (see Colville’s Letters, pp. 117, 152, 173,
269, 273, 274, 277). In 1596 Angus’s son James,
who had been detained in Edinburgh as a hos-
tage, was sent to persuade the Isla chief to sur-
render. In May the King issued a proclamation

LI.— JAMES MACDONALD APPEARS BEFORE THE PRIVY COUNCIL, PRESENTS
A LETTER FROM HIS FATHER SURRENDERING HIS LANDS IN HIS
FAVOUR, AND HEARS THE KING'S WILL REGARDING HIS FATHER AND
HIMSELF.
'J'HE quhilk day in presens of the Kingis Majestie and Lordis of his

undirly and fulfill quhatsumevir thingis salbe prescrivit and appointit to
be done be thame, thair kin, freindis, tennentis, and servandis to his
Majestie to the uttermost of thair poueris. Lyke as the said James
summoning the lieges to join him in an expedi-
tion to the West. Maclean and others thereupon
submitted, and Maclean received a grant of Angus’s
lands in Isla (see pp. 101 and 106). Angus still
held out, and on 3rd August 1596 Sir William
Stewart, Comraendator of Pittenweem, received com-
mission as Lieutenant in the Isles and Highlands
with power to levy men to the number of 1000. The
Acta of the Privy Council from 12th August on-
wards record impositions of taxation in different
parts of the country for this service. The next
document gives the sequel.
1 Meanwhile the expedition proceeded, for this
submission had not reached the ears of the Lieu-
tenant. In a letter dated Glasgow,j22nd Oct. 1596,
William Stewart of Houston tells the Lord Secre-
tary how, on account of lack of money, he has sent
Eobert Stewart to Kintyre, to be met there by
Johnne Stewart of Astok, “be quliais advyse he is
to try the obedience of Angus M c Connell and the
rest of the inhabitantis of the cun trie. ” “At the
time of my wrytting to his Majestie,” he says,
“ I gat sic adverteisment quhilk brocht into my
mynd the auld saying ‘he had mister of ane lang
stalkit spone that souppis kaill with the devill.’ I
have done quhat I may upone necessitie, as your
lordship may sie, to advance his service, and luikis
for obedience onlie. Yit lam suirlie adverteissit
that Angus hes his haill forces togiddir in Yla that
he may mak upone pretence to reveng his parti-
cular against his cussingis in the Glenis of Ireland;
but, knawing assuiritlie his falset and craft, and
not certane of his intentione, and being suire that
he hes sent ane secreit and craftie fallow to his sone
James, quha past by heir sence the wrytting of this
letter, thairfoir I haif writtin to his Majestie, as he
tendiris his awin honour and the obedience in this
turne, that his Majestie will cans tak gude attend-
ence to the said James and haif ane trustie seruant
of his Heines awin to beir him company at all tymes
day and nycht without occasione of suspitioune,
untill the tyme we try assuirdilie thair intentione in
obeying or not” {BalcarresPapers, vi. 74). “Upon
the bruit of this expedition,” says Spotswood, “ the
principals of the Isles did all submit themselves
offering obedience to appear before the King at the
time his Majesty should appoint. So that expedi-
tion ceased, the Colonel going no farther than Ila,
where he remained a few days, and took assurance
for their appearance ” (p. 416, ed. 1677). On 11th
November 1596 the Lieutenant presented his report
and received his exoneration.

Majestie unto the tyme he obtene his Hienes speciall licence to that

tioun quhairof in particular his Hienes superseidis, quhill the thingis
abonewrittin be fulfillit.
1 The summary treatment of Angus Macdonald’s
proposals is striking. The Council naturally
disregarded the conditions drawn up by a man
whose lands were already forfeited to the Crown,
and proceeded to state “the will of the King” in
plain terms. (See subsequent documents for the
final declaration of duties required by the Crown
to he’performed by Angus.) Angus’s son Sir James
did not forget the offers made in the above letter
when, in 1598, he opposed his father, and ulti-
mately assumed the headship of the clan (see note
p. 105).

LV. —NARRATIVE OF THE TROUBLES IN ISLAY, WITH AN ACCOUNT
OF THE BATTLE AT LOCH GRUINART AND OF THE DEATH OF SIR
LAUCHLAN MACLEAN. ³
mmS yeir of God 1598 Sir Laglilane Macklain wes slain in tlie ile of
Ila by his owne sister-sone, Sir James Mackonald, the eldest sone of
Angus Mackonald of Kintyre; all which proceeded from ambition and
revenge, thus.—Sir Laghlan Macklain haveing some credet at Court, his
covetous ambition, with a desyre of revenge, thrust him one to dame the
inheritance of the whole ile of Ila, whereof he had some time yeirs befor
1 Angus was now to confine himself to the south
of the island, and to retire from theßinns, recently
acquired by Maclean, and the castle of Dunivaig.
2 An indication of the schemes of the house of
Argyll, afterwards elaborated by the Earl and
his kinsmen Campbell of Calder. Under the
cloak of friendship, they sought to serve their
own ends by making the reconciliation of the
Crown with the Macdonalds impossible. (See
later documents).
3 Angus had returned to the West early in 1597.
As he did not seem inclined to fulfil the con-
ditions imposed, his son Sir James was sent in
the hope of persuading him to make good his
promises. Meanwhile troubles broke out among
the Macallasters of Loupe. Father and son
took opposite sides; and the strife reached its
climax in the barbarous assault by the latter on
his father’s house of Askomull in Kiutyre (see
Pitcairn’s Criminal Trials, iii. 5, and Gregory’s
History, pp. 281, 282). The subsequent conduct of
Sir James, as head of his clan, compelled the Privy
Council in June 1598 to issue a proclamation for an
advance into Kintyre. Despite the fact that in
August Sir James had received a royal letter ap-
proving his recent conduct in Kintyre (Pitcairn,
iii. 9), preparations were pushed forward, and the
King signified his intention of leading the levies.
On 25th August, however, commission was given to
the Duke of Lennox, the change being probably
caused, as Gregory suggests, “by news received,
in the course of the month of August, of a conflict
between the Macdonalds and Macleans,” an account
of which is here printed. We have no record to
tell whether the expedition took place; it is pro-
bable that the levies were soon disbanded, and that
the Crown devoted its attention, from a distance, to
the internecine strife in the island.
o


obtaned and purchased a new gift by his credet at Court, being alwyse
hither! o the possession and inheritance of the Clandonald; all which
Macklain did now think to bring casalie to passe, Sir James Mackonald,
the just inheritor thereof, being young, and his father Angus Mackonald
being aged. So Macklain assembleth his whole tryb and ther assisters,
and in warlyke maner invadeth Ila, to take possession thereof by vertue
of his new right; which, when Sir James Mackonald vnderstood, he con-
veined his freinds, and came lykewise into that same island, to interrupt,
iff it were possible, the proceedings of his vnkynd vncle Macklain ; wher
such as did love them both and desyred the peace of the cuntrey did
mediat a long tyme betuein them, and took paines in essaying to aggrie
them. Sir James yeilded to give his vncle the half of the yland dureing
his lyff, although he had no just title therto, provyding he wold acknow-
ledge the same to be holdeu as his progenitors (the Clanlain) had alwise
the Rinnes of the said ile of Ila, that is, for ther personall service to the
Clandonald. And, moreover, he offered to submit the controversie to any
indifferent freinds Macklain pleased to choyse; and the King’s Majestic
to be oversman. 1 Bot Macklain, runing headlong to his owne mischeiff,
much against the opinion of his freinds, who advysed him to the contrary,
did refuse all offers of peace, vnles his nephue wold then presentlie resigne
vnto him the title and possession of the whole Hand. Whervpon they
did both resolve to feight, though Sir James wes far inferior in number.
Thus there ensued a cruell and sharp battell at the heid of Loch-greinard 2
in Ila, couragiouslie foughten a long tyme on either syd. Sir James in
the begining caused his vantguard mack a compas in fashion of a retrait,
thereby to get the sun at ther back, and to tak the advantage of ane hill
which wes hard by, and which Sir Laghlane Macklain indevoared to
1 According to the Account of the Clan Maclean
the matter in dispute was the definition of the
boundaries of their estates “at a certain farm on
the seaside, called Portaskaig, which, from its
convenience as a landing-place, was deemed of
considerable importance by each party” (p. 86).
2 Maclean, his sons Hector Oig and Lachlan Gig,
and 600 followers, landed at Ellain-Niarahh (or
Navei sland) off Gruinart, and then proceeded with
260 men to Gruinart {ibid. p. 87). There is a
reference to the conflict in a letter, dated 7th August
1598, printed in Colville’s Letters (Bann. Club) p.
289. James Maksorle, we are told, had sent 400
“Ireland men ” to Isla, “quha wer the prinoipall
executaris of this oonspiracie.”


possesse. In end, Sir James liaveing gottin first tlie possession of that
hill, he repulsed the enemies vantguard, and, forceing ther main battell, he
quyte overthrew them. Macklain wes their slain, with fourscore of the
cheiff men of his kin, and tuo hundred commoun souldiers lying deid
about him. His sone, Laghlan-Barrogh-Macklain, being dangerouslie
wounded, wes chased with' the rest of his men to their boats and
weshells. Sir James Mackonald wes also wounded at this conflict, and
hardlie recovered afterward. Ther were slain of the Clandonald about
threttie, and above thriescore wounded. So wee sie that ambition,
reuenge, and covetousnes hasteneth destruction, which did thrust Mac-
klain headlong to seik his owne rwyne; and the warr begun by him
without reasone the yeir 1585 ended now this yeir 1598 by his death. 1
Sir Laghlan Macklain hath thrie responses from a witch befor he vnder-
took this journey vnto Hay; first, advysing him to be awarr to land in
that iland vpon a Thursday ; nixt, that he should not drink of the water
of a well besyd Groinard ; and, thirdlie, that one Macklain should be slain
at Groynard. The first he transgressed vnwillinglie, being driven into the
iland of Ila by a tempest vpon a Thursday; the second he transgressed
negligentlie, haveing drunk of that water befor he wes awarr; and so he
wes killed ther at Groinard, as wes foretold him, hot doubtfullie. Thus
endeth all these that doe trust in such kynd of responces, or doe hunt
after them.
This broills and vproars did so move the King against the Clandonald,
that, his Majestie afterward finding the inheritance both of Kintyre and
Ila to be at his owne disposition, he gave all these lands to the Earle of
Argyle and the Campbells; whervpon proceeded the troubles that arose
since in these pairts betuein the Campbells and the Clandonald, the yeirs
1614, 1615, 1616; from whence the vtter ruyn of the Clandonald in
Scotland did spring.
1 The Account of the Clan Maclean (pp. 94, 95)
tells of further trouble in the island which
followed immediately on the succession of Hector
Oig, son of Lauohlan Maclean. The young chief,
accompanied by Mac-Dhonnuil-Duy of Lochiel, the
chief of the Clancameron, the chief of the Mackin-
nons, Macleod of Dunvegan, and Macneill of Barra,
attacked Sir James Macdonald at Benbigrie or Ben
Bige and routed him, Sir James was compelled to
flee to Kintyre and to leave Isla at the mercy of the
Macleans. For three days they ravaged the island.
(See also Gregory, pp. 285-6).

LXIV.— CONCERNING THE EARL OF ARGYLL’S CLAIM TO KINTYRE AS A
MEANS FOR HOLDING THE CLANDONALD IN CHECK; WITH A REFER-
ENCE TO A FORMER OFFER ANENT ISLAY.
. . fTIHE mater demandit is the gift of the landis of Kintyre 1 ; quliairin it
wald be rememberit how small or na proffeitt they evir importeit
to the King, his Majestie often tymes being driven to put the cuntrey to
greitar chairges in the spaice of thrie or four yeir for getting in of the rent
thairof, quhilk is nocht greit, than mycht half doubled the pryce and
utter valew of the haill land.
The dispositioun of it to the Erie of Ergyle will embark him in
actioun aganis the Clandonald, being the strangest piller of all the
broken Hieland men, quha nevir in any aige wer civill, bot hes bein the
scoolemaisteris and fosteraris of all barbaritie, savaignes, and crueltye,—
hes evir from the beginning bein addictit nocht only to rebellioun within
this.continent land and the iles, bot evir wer assisteris of the northerne
Irische people, duelling in Ireland, in all thair rebellionis. Now, this
nobleman in actioun of blude being enterit with the said Clandonald,
nocht only will he procuire thair rwitteing out and utter suppressing, bot
upoun that same respect will evir be ane feir to those in the northe of
Ireland to rebell, haveing ane enemye lyand sa neir to thame; quha,
besyides that dewty quhilk as ane nobleman and his Majesties subject he
is bund unto, will, upoun his former embarking aganis the said Clan-
donald, preis be all meanis to suppres thair doingis.
1 The gift of Kintyre was a reward for the Earl’s
services against the Clan Gregor. In a letter from
the Privy Council to the King, dated 19th June

1 In December 1607, Sir James Macdonald had
made another unsuccessful attempt to escape from
Edinburgh Castle. He was tried on that charge,
among others, on 13th May 1609 (q.v.).
2 Two days before, Andrew, Lord Stewart of
Ochiltree, and Andrew, Bishop of the Isles, were
empowered to meet with Angus Macdonald of Dun-
yvaig and Hector Maclean of Duart, confer with
them anent their obedience to his Majesty, and
ascertain what surety they would give. They
were to report to the Council by 15th April follow-
ing. On 12th April proclamation was made pro-
roguing the meeting of the fenoibles till July Ist
(vol. viii. p. 72); and two days later (14th), the
Lords of Privy Council issued a commission to
Andrew, Bishop of the Isles, Andrew, Lord Stewart
of Ochiltree, and Sir James Hay, Lord of Bewlie;
Comptroller, to confer, when and where they
pleased, with Angus Macdonald of Dunyvaig and
Hector Maclean of Duart ‘anent the effairis of the
Yllis,’ and to report ‘thair ansueris and offeris ’
to the Council by 20th May. Their instructions
were (1) to propose to Macdonald and Maclean
that they should find caution for payment of the


urgent and weglitie effairis, ressavit some continewatioun and delay thir
yeiris bypast, whereby the rebellious and insolent personis inhabitants
within the saidis Yllis, upoun hoip of impunitie, and upoun a fals imagina-
tioun and consait apprehendit be thame that his Majestic had bene for-
getfull of thair rebellious cariage, hes tane the bauldnes to continew in
thair wicked and unhappie trade of leveing, committing barbarous
murthouris and utheris villanyes, every ane upoun another, without feir
of God or reverence of the law ; as alsua they withhauld frome his Majestic
his rent and patrimonie dew to his Heynes furth of the saidis Yllis, and
ar avowed enemeyis to the treade of fischeing quhilk the peciable sub-
jects of the in-cuntrey wald intertenye within the saidis Yllis, to the
honnour, weill, and benefite of the haill kingdome. And now, his Majestic
haveing resolved no langer to delay this expeditioun, hot to advance and
set the same ford wart this present yeir, his Majestic finding himselff
boundin thairunto in honnour and conscience, seeing it hes pleasit God
to airme his Majestic with pouer and force be sea and land to suppres
and trede under all and quhatsumevir rebellious lymmairis within ony
pairt of his Majesteis impyre and dominionis, his Heynes for this effect
hes given ordour and directioun that some of his Majesteis foirceis and
garisoun in Irland, with schipping and galayis weill providit and furneist
with munitioun, poulder, and bullet, salbe sent to the saidis Yllis, and to
meit in Yla and some pairt of the North Yllis upoun the first day of
Junii nixttocum, and thair to prosequute his Majesteis service according
as they salbe directit be his Heynes Lieutennentis and Commissionairis
to that effect. And, becaus the executioun of this service in that princelie
and substantious forme quhilk is requisite will require some forder forceis
King’s rents ; (2) that they and their followers
should be answerable to the laws; (3) that they
should deliver to his Majesty all their houses of
defence and ‘ crannakis ’ in the Isles ; (4) that they
should renounce all jurisdiction hitherto usurped
by them over the King’s subjects, and should live
in future as private persons, obedient to the ordin-
ary sheriffs, bailies, justices, and other ministers of
the law ; (5) that they should content themselves
with such lands as his Majesty should design, and
under such form as he should appoint; (6) that
they should destroy their ‘birlingis, limfadis and
galleyis,’ reserving only such as should be necessary
for transporting his Majesty’s dues and for other
necessary uses ; (7) that they and their freinds, ‘ at
leist sa mony of thame’ as were or should be ‘found
of abilitie,’ should ‘ putt thair bairnis and childrens
to the scoolis’ as the Council should appoint; (8)
that they should forbear wearing any kind of
armour (especially guns, bows, and two-handed
swords) except only one-handed swords and
targes.

Heynes thairfore is moved to imploy the assistance and forceis of his

and by the tenor of these presents do remit, to Alexander Oig M'Coneill the rancour of our
mind, royal suit, and all action or cause which we have conceived, held, or do hold against him,

transgressions, and offences done and committed by the said AJexander at any time past

nouther Glasgow, Galloway, the steuartrie of Kirkcudbrycht, nor the
gritest parte of the baronis of Renfrew hes be ony of thair presenceis
acknowlegeit his Majesteis proclamatioun, yitt I haif putt my hand to

the castell of Dimyvaig, the secund of this instant a little efter the sone-
setting,—in nomber of veshell tuo Inglishe shippis, the one under the con-
duct of Sir Williame Sanct Johnne, callit ‘The Advantage,’ quha behavis
himselff verie cairfullie and honestlie in all occasionis of this service, the
other under the governament of Owne Wenne, ane followar of the other
with ane pynnage, with other tua Scottis schippis of my awne, togidder
with ten barkis. Immediatlie, ankeris being cassin, I causit proclamatioun
be maid that no man sould pas to the schoir nor ressett nane frome the
schoir without speciall licence gevin be me to that effect. Upoun the thrid,
airlie, Angus M c Coneill and some of his speciall freindis come to schoir and
desirit acces for conference with me ; whiche I refusit quhill forder I hard
of thair obedyence. And, to try the same, I directit my Lord Bischop of
the Yllis furth to speeke thame; quha, efter conference with the said
Angus, fand him in his wordis very conformable to his former promissis,
bot, being tuicheit in speciall with the delyverie of the house, seamed to
schift some thing and to cast the burdyne thairof upoun his sone Alexander,
quha for the present absentit himselff. The quhilk being reportit to me
be the said Bischop, I directit him bak agane to assure thame, without
present delyverie of the house, that I wald lay presentlie seadge thairto.
Off the whiche sa sone as thay wer informed, and seeing me mak pre-
paratioun thairto, the said Alexander come furth of the house for confer-
ence with my Lord Bischop ; who, without conditioun, offerrit himselff in
all humilitie in my will, and- promeist to my Lord Bischop in taikin
thairof to delyver the house to me upoun the morne, —whiche wes
the ferd day befoir ten houris befoir none, —desiring my Lord Bischop
to assure me of the same, and to crave licence of conference with me
to his fader and himselff in the meantyme; whiche I planelie refusit
quhill efter delyverie of the house. The whiche thay did the hour foirsaid;
and, the same being ressavit be my servitouris, and thay and all thairis
excludit, the castell then being maid sure in my keeping, I grantit licence
to Angus, and Alexander his sone, with uther tuo of his best freindis, to
come aboarde of my awne shipp ; quhair thay all in ane voce with all
humilitie offerrit to performe quhatsoevir thing the said Angus had


promeist or subscryvit of befoir. This turne being done, my secund cair
wes to mak diligente searcbe to know yf ony of the Yrishe rebellis had
arryvit in the yle. And, for this effect, haveing sent searcheouris in all
pairtis of the ile, I apprehendit twa of Odoharty his disperat company;
and I haif committit thame in the castell of Dunyvaig in yrnis ; whome
I sail keepe quhill I heir forder of your Lordshipis directionis. As for
thair ressettaris, I haif putt thame under caution to compeir befoir me
quhat tyme I pleis call for thame. And, heiring a brute that thair wes
some ma come lykwayes to this ile, I not onlie sent certane of my awne
sojouris, hot Alexander Oig, to mak inquisitioun for thame; whome I
find verie diligent and cairfull in that service and in all utheris my
imploymentis. I am alsua informed that some of thame ar gone to
Kintyr; quhairfoir it salbe goode that your Lordships write to the Erll
of Ergyle thairanent, as I haif done alreddy. And in the meantyme I sail
not be cairles to watche all thir boundis, conforme to your Lordshipis last
letter. Quhill this wes in doing, I appointit ane court to the nynt of this
instant, and causit some come in that could best gif up dittay for
preparatioun to the same ; hot fand verie few plaintis or dilaitit personis
worthy punisment. Soone efter, upoun that same day that I ressavit
the Clan Donnald, as said is, M c Clane send tua commissionaris craving
my licence to resorte to the camp for conference with me in quhat
maner I wald prescryve unto him; the whiche being grantit unto him,
accompanyed with fyve or sex of his freindis, he come abuirde of my
awne schip upoun the fyft day, accompanyed with his cosine the
Laird of Coull, and M°Kynnell; and, after offeris of all kynd of dewytie
and obedyence to his Majesteis lawis, I continewit all ansuer geving
him quhill I come to his awne cun trey of Coull. Sensyne I haif
haldin courte upoun this instant in Yla, not far from the castell, —quhair

LXXI.— LETTER FROM ANDREW KNOX, BISHOP OF THE ISLES, TO THE
KING ANENT THE PROCEEDINGS IN THE WEST, AND CRAVING REMISSION
OF HIS DUTIES THERE.
"pLEAS your Sacreit Majestic—
According to your Hieehnes derectioun, as your Majesteis Lieuten-
nent haith laitlie visitat your Hechnes West lylandis, whair also the
1 Lord Ochiltree informs us, in a letter dated
Duart in Mull, 18th August 1608, that he left
Islay on the afternoon of 14th August, and arrived
next day at Duart in Mull, after a very stormy
passage. The English galley could not have
weathered it, “yf it had not pleasit God to have
gevin hir lucke to anker in the Sound of Yla.”
After speaking of his work in Mull, he says, “ in
executing of that part of my commissioun in
destroying of lumfaddis, birlingis, and heyland
gallayis, I find this cure grite difficultye, that, in
respect of the grite nomber of those veshellis
quhilkis ar intertenyit upoun the mayne schoir
quhilkis ar so offensive to the Ylismen that, unles
thay keepe the lyke to counter thame with, thay
can not eshew thair oppressioun: nouther can I
justlie spuilyee thame thairof, unles the lyke ordour
he tane with those that ar upoun the maneschoir
opposite to the West and North Yllis.” He accord-
ingly requests a commission to destroy the vessels
in the mainland, and also “all sic housis upoun
the mayne schoir appertening to ony YUismen, or
that may he ane ressett to ony fugitive rehell oute
of the Yllis ” (Royal Letters, 1601-1612, p. 153 ;
Register of Privy Council, viii. p. 523).


cheif men of your Majesteis North Isles did also meit his Lordschip, with
such obediens to thais your Heichnes lawes practisit be his Lordschip, as
the testemoneis recordit will heir sufficient record, so have I, being evir
in cumpanie with his Lordschip, faythfullie writtin the trew historic of

of the whiche dyvers perhaps may be presentit to your Majesteis secreit 1

Lieutennent and Admirall hes kythit thair curage, visdome, and ernist

2 The Bishop had written to his Majesty on 27th
June 1607, protesting that an account of the state
of the Western Islands, “togidder with the oaussis
of the inordinat leiving of that pepill,” was strictly
true, “ bothe be sicht and experience.” He had
heard that the King “wes moved to doubt of the
veritie of sum assertiones ”, and asks for investiga-
tion, by commissioners if necessary, for his justifica-
tion, “albeit a litill tyme hes and will try farther
the undoubted treuth of every point thairof.”
(Letter in Denmylne Collection, 33. 3. 12 (1597-
1609), pointed in Original Letters relating to Eccles;
Affairs (Bann : Club), i. p. 94.)

cessouris may rejoiss in the lyk be the future rigne of your Heichnes
a The story of the treatment of the Western chiefs
will be found in the Cronickill of the Kingis of Scot-
land (Mait. Club, p. 176). After narrating the
story of thd expedition and its doings in Mull, the
writer proceeds :—“And quhan he had tane suir
conditionis off Angus M°Coneill, that he suld enter
at ane certaue day befoir the Counsell, heaffand, as
said is, resauit his hous [Dunivaig] and mannit the
same, as also his eldest sone being in ward in the
Castell of Edinburgh, he sufferit him to go frie.
The rest of the principallis being not so willing to
rander thair housis, nor to mak suirittie for thair
entrie, he, be the awys of the Bischop of the Yllis,
callit Mr Andro Knox, callis thame into ane ser-
mound in the Kingis schip callit the Mone, quhair,
efter the same, he mowit thame to dyne. Bot in
end, he sayis to thame, that thay most stay, beoaus
the same wes his Majesteis will; and taking wp
sail!, bringis thame with him . . . and com to Air
the thrid day of October, bringing tham all with
him to Edinburgh ; and presentis thame to the
Counsell, quha committis thame in ward, quhill
the Kingis will suld be knawine. And efter ane
sohort speace, thay war releiffit under suiritty
to pey the by-run dewitteis and be obedient in tyme
euming and also to entir befoir the Counsell at ane
peremptour day assignit to tname be the Counsell.
Bot the hous of Ylla, callit Doniwyik, wes keipit be
the Lord Uchiltrie to the Kingis wse.” The part
which the Bishop had played will thus explain his
uneasiness. The trick at Mull was an unconscious
repetition of the ruse in Islay-sound in 1230 {ante,
p. 9).

LIEUTENANCY OF THE ISLES.
mHE quhilk day in presence of the Lordis of Secrite Counsale com-
peirit personalie Andro, Lord Stewart of Uchiltrie, his Majesteis
lieutenant and justice in the Yllandis of this realme, and maid his reporte
unto the saidis Lordis anent the forme of his procedure upoun the pointis
of his commissioun of lieutennandrie, as follows :
In the first, he declairit that, according to the first point of his com-
missioun, he causit wairne the capitanes and chiftanis of clanis in the
YUis to compeir befoir him to rander thair obedience, and that Angus
M c Coneill of Dunyvaig, Hector M°Clayne of Dowart, Donnald Gorme of
Slate, Donnald M°Allane M°Ean of Ylantyrum, capitane of the Clan
Rannald, Lauchlane M c Clan, brother to the said Hectour, Alexander
M c Cleud, brother to Eorie M c Cleud of Dunveggane, Allane M'Clayne,
sone to Charlis M c Clane of Ardgoure, Neill M c llduy and Neill M'Eory,
servitouris to the said Hectour, come all in to him frelie and of thair awne
accord, without promeis, band, conditioun, or assuirance, and in maist
humble and submissive maner randerit and offerit thair obedience to his
Majestic and to the said Lieutennent as his Heynes officeair. And
declairit that he had all thir personis, except the said Angus M'Coneill,
heir with him in this burgh of Edinburgh, and promeist to enter thame
before the saidis Lordis the morne at sevin houris in the moirning. And


vanceing of grite sowmes furth of oure cofferis boith heir and there; yit
so far is this worke from being brogbt to ane point of perfectioun as we
perceave litle or nothing as yit done thairin. But of any manis travellis
hethirtill taikin in that busynes by all appeirance the Bischop of the Illis
his last joirney doeth cary some lykliehood and schew of some good
succes within the boundis of his diocye; and, becaus he doeth now intend
a new jorney unto these pairtis, and that it is expedient that he sould be
assisted and countenanceid with all suche pouer and authoritie as in suche
a case is fitting, we haif thairupoun granted unto the said Bischop lyfrent
gift of the keiping of the house of Duniveg for his greater securetie the
tyme of his resorting in that cuntrey; and thairfore you ar to direct
summair chairges aganis the present keipairis and detenaris of that house
that they mak present deliverie of the same to the said Bischop or to
any suche uther as salbe frome him directit to ressave the same in his
name, and that thay also deliver upoun inventorie all suche poulder,
bullet, musket, and other warfar provisioun as wes left unto thame for
keiping of the same house. We haif also exped to the said Bischop and
his deputis to be appointed by him a gift of the stewartrie of the whole
files, boith west and north, willing you to authorise the same boith by
chargeis and proclamatiounis whiche salbe in any sorte requisite. And,
becaus some acclameing pouer of jurisdictioun over those files in tyme
past have not maid muche farder use of there offices then upoun that
cullour sometymes to oppres the inhabitantis, nochtwithstanding all these
Illis, at least most pairt, be of oure propertie, over whiche no uther officer
bot our awne stewart sould have jurisdictioun and power, you ar thairfore
to inhibite and dischairge all and quhatsumevir officeris other than oure
stewart and his deputis foirsaidis to use, exerce, and usurp any jurisdic-
tioun in any of these Illis, upoun quhatsumevir pretext or challenge to
be maid by thame that the same do lye within schirefdome quhairof thay
haif the heritable graunte. And becaus it haith bene informed unto us
that muche of the disobedience for not appearing before you haith pro-
ceidit in these Ilsmen of there too summarie citatioun, since bothe thay
are so far distant, the seas ar to be crossed, and the uncertantie of the
T


windes ar suche as all of tliame ar verie just causes for thame to sute
some langer tyme in their summonds : in whiche regaird it is oure plea-
soure and will that in all citationis, either before you, the Lordis of
Sessioun, or the Justice Generali, of ony of these Illismen heirafter, that
suche of thame as dwell in ony of the West lies and will before the first
of November nixt appoint a domicill in the toun of Rosa in Buite, and
suche of the North lies as befoir the same tyme will appoint the lyke in
the burgh of Invernes, and wilbe content that a citatioun maid at these
placeis by thame appointed salbe als sufficient as gif it were at thair awne
dwellingis, and sail betuix and that tyme caus a note to be broght of these
domicillis to the clerk of Counsell and ane other double thairof to the
keipair of the signet, none of these so doing salbe heireftir chairged
upoun lesse space then threscore dayis. And you ar to gif directioun for
that effect, and to publische the same by proclamatioun. And heirwith
we ar to will and desyre you by proclamatioun also to dischairge all
commissionis of lieutennandrie whiche at ony tyme heirtofoir have been
graunted by us within the boundis of these lies, and to tak the chairge
and directing of all materis that concerne that busynes to your selves.
And, in so far as the said Ilesmen, in a court haldin be the said Bischop
at Icolmakill, have bound thameselffis to performe dew obedience to us
and our authoritie, and to keip peace and quietnes in the cuntrey, undir
suche panes and penalties as we sould be pleased to enjoyne, as also have
with the said Bischopis consent set doun and maid suche statutis and
ordouris among thameselves as we cannot hot allow of: thairfore we ar
to will and desyre you to consider the same, and to caus engrosse and
register both band and statutis of court in the buikis of Prevey Counsell,
and in your discretionis to add and enjoyne suche penalteis for the
breache and contraveyning of the said bandis and statutes as salbe most
fitt and expedient for oure service and the keiping of our peace in those
boundis. And, becaus the said Bischop of the lies doeth intend at his
awne cost and chairges to visite those Illis this sommer, and haith aggred
with one Johnne Masoun of Kingsline to go thither with him with thrie
schippis weill furnished, and haith desyred that he may haif ample and


lairge commissioun to boitb of tbame, as gif tliay wer directed frome us
and at our cliairgcs to persew all outlawis fugitive and dissobedient per-
sonis, to tak and apprehend thame and present tbame to justice, with all
suche ample and lairge clauses as by thame salbe demaundit, and whiche
you in reasoun do think may be graunted, we ar thairfore to desyre you
to expeid the same, that so boith thay thameselffis and otheris by their
example may be encuraged to suche worthie interpryses And
so, leaving the care of all these thingis unto you, we bid you richt
hairtelie fairwele. From our Court at Thetforde the aucht of Maii 1610.

TAMES R.
Right trusty and right welbeloved cosen and counsellour, and
right trusty and welbeloved counsellouris, wee greete you well:—
Having considered the greate paynes and travelles of Andrew, Byshoppe
of the lies, taken in reducing of that rude people to some order
and acknowledgement of our authority, whereby he hath not only dis-
charged the dewty of a faithful byshoppe, but likewise of a good servant
to us; and forasmuch as he, to his greate charges, keepeth our castle of
Dunivaig in Hay sufficientlie provided with men and victualles, whereby
wee are not onlie releved of the expenses formerlie bestowed by our
comptroller for the keeping of the same, but also all occasions of trouble
are taken away, and the seedes of discorde choked before they take
roote : It is therefore our pleasour that yee caus that pension which wee
granted unto him oute of the dewtyes of our lies be dewlie payed unto
him, as well for the termes bygone, if any be resting, as yearlie in time
coming, conform to his provision thereunto And, becaus divers
principal! Highland and lies men, by a title acquired from us by vertew
of the acte of annexation, do enjoy a greate parte of the church landes
belonging to his byshoprik, it is our speciall pleasour that yee sette no


parte of our patrimonie in the saidis lies eyther in feu or lease to any of
the said Highland or lies men, especiallie to Hector Macklane of Dowarte,
til they renounce all such church landes as they enjoy by vertew of the
said acte of annexation. And, lastlie, becaus the Abacie of Ecolmekille
and Priorie of Archattan were, in respeete of the smallnes of the rent of
the Byshoprik of the Isles, commonlie given in commendam to the
byshoppes thereof, and the saidis Abbacie and Priorie being both as yet
with our croune by vertew of the acte of annexation, it is our speciall
pleasour that yee dissolve them both from our aforesaid croune, and by
a speciall acte of the nexte ensewing Parliament annex the same ad
perpetuam remanentiam to the Byshoprik of the lies. And, all these
premisses recommending to your speciall care and diligence, wee bid your
farewell. At our pallace of Whitehalle, the 24th of Februarie 1612,

son of Sorleybuy, brother of James Macdonald of
Dunivaig and Glens. Sorleybuy had managed the
Antrim estate, and ultimately assumed the title to
the exclusion of Angus, son of James. Angus was
now dead (see p. 155), and Sorleybuy’s son, having
obtained a tack of Islay from James VI. {Of. p. 152
and p. 155 with foot-note), was in possession when
the above action took place.

1 On 24th August 1614 the Book of Sederunts
records—“ane missive frome his Majestie anent
Sir Rounald M c Soirle” (Register of the Privy Coun-
cil, x. p. 267). We do not know its contents, but
we may imagine it referred to a heritable grant of
the island. See Gregory, p. 348, and reference to
letter in Denmylne Collection (Bth June 1613).
2 A contemporary document on the Houses in
the Isles begins its description of the “strenthis”
in the West Isles thus :—“ In Ila ane house callit
Dunivaig, perteaning to Makooneill; Lochgurmont
perteaning also to him, situat within ane loch, and
usurped be Makcleane.” The paper is undated,
but it was found enclosed in Primrose’s Informa-
tion, and, though in a different hand, seems to be of
the same date.


LXXXVI.— INFORMATION RECEIVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CAPTURE OF
DUNIVAIG BY RONALD OIG MACDONALD, AND OF ITS RECAPTURE BY
ANGUS OIG MACDONAVLD.
mHE House of Dunyveg in Yla, being possessed and keeped be the
-L Bischop of the Yles his brother and two or three servandes,- the
same house hes bene of late surprysed and tane be one Ronald Oig,
aledgeand to be bastard sone to vmquhile Angus M c Coneill of Dunyveg,
whom the said Angus did neuer in his tyme acknowlege to be his sone.
This Ronnald, being a vagabound fellow without ony certane residence,
come latelie to Yla, and, finding the house to be but slenderlie keeped,
resolued to surpryse and tak the same. And, for this effect, he and his
complices, being four or fyve in nomber, retered thame selues to ane
wood neare by the house, whair thay made some ledderes, and with thame
one day airlie in the morning thay clam the utter wall, keeped thame
selues obscure whill the yettes were oppined, and then they took the
house, and patt the Bishopes folkes oute thereof. The reporte whereof
comeing to young Angus M°Coneill, laufull brother to Sir James, who wes
within sex myles of the house for the tyme, he immediatlie, according to
the countrie fassioun, send the fyre crose athorte the countrey, warning all
the countrey people who wer affected to his Maiesteis obedience to ryse
and concur with him in the recouerie of the house; and so he, with such
assistaunce as come to him, inclosed the house. Thay within held good
for sex dayes, being weellprouyded with pulder, hint, and bullett, whereof
thay fand good store in the house; and thay were prodigall aneugh in
bestowing the same vpon the beseagares. Bot, in end perceaueing that
thay war not able to keepe the house, thay in the night eshued at a bak yett
in a litle boat with sex oares which lay at the castell, and took with
them such goodes as thay fand in the house. Angus followed thame;
bot what farder has fallen oute, is not as yitt come to the Counselles
knowledge. Sir James M c Coneill is the Counselles informar in all this
busynes; and, as he sayes, his brother hes offered to delyuer the house
bak againe to the Bishopes servandes, who refuised to ressaue the same.
