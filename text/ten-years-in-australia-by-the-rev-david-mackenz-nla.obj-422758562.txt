PREFACE TO TEE FIRST EDITION.
It is the custom of authors to assign, in what is called a Preface,
the reasons which induced them to appear before the Public. The
only reason which I think it necessary to assign for the following
publication, is my belief that a residence of ten years in New South
Wales has enabled me to gather such information as may be of some
use to intending emigrants.
It is true that there has already issued from the press a host of
books on this colony; but some of these hooks contain but very little
information that would be of practical use to the emigrant on his
arrival here, while others of them, half filled with politics and private
squabbles, were evidently written by men who either had some selfish
ends to serve, or who never had any long or real experience of a
bush life.” It would be vain in me to insinuate that lam able to
supply this deficiency. I will merely say that my only object is, to
give a full and faithful statement of what this colony now is, and of
the prospects which it holds out to the different classes of
emigrants.
The materials for the following pages were gathered during my
travels for the last ten years through all parts of Australia; and I can
confidently add, that in thus detailing my own practical experience, I
have no interests except those of truth to promote.

AUSTRALIA IN 1851.
The greater part of Mr. Mackenzie’s, work is occupied with his
experience in New South Wales, one of the several colonies into which
Australia is divided, hut as throughout that country the climate, as
regards agricultural produce, is nearly the same, the occupations of
the colonists and the laws and customs the same, experience in one
colony applies to all, with certain exceptions, which it is the object
of these introductory pages to point out.
The emigrant who seeks employment in hired labour will find, in
all the colonies of Australia, a demand for shepherds, ploughmen,
gardeners in vineyards, dairymen and women, horsekeepers, bul-
lock drivers, domestic servants, and a limited number of mechanics.
The capitalist will find his best investment in cattle and sheep,
unless he is experienced enough to venture on mining speculations ;
and for everything in the shape of rural pastoral life, Mr. Mackenzie’s
experience will be found a sufficient guide.
CONSTITUTION OF THE AUSTRALIAN COLONIES.
In addition to New South Wales, there are three independent
colonies, founded in Australia at various periods. Western Australia,
commonly known as Swan River; Victoria, or Port Philip; and South
Australia,
GOVERNMENT OF AUSTRALIA.
TJndee. an Act passed in the session of 1850 (13 and 14 Victoria,
cap. 59), the colonies of New South Wales, Victoria, Van Diemen’s
Land, and South Australia, each received power to form legislative
Assemblies, consisting, two-thirds of members elected by a wide suf-
frage, and one-third appointed by the Governor for the time being,
having control over all internal affairs except the waste lands.

Land, and South Australia, each received power to form legislative
Assemblies, consisting, two-thirds of members elected by a wide suf-
frage, and one-third appointed by the Governor for the time being,
having control over all internal affairs except the waste lands.


WESTERN AUSTRALIA
Western Australia was founded in 1829, by one of the Peel
family, after a fashion which ensured its failure. The country was un~
surveyed—even unknown. The emigrants, chiefly of the higher classes,
were entirely inexperienced in the arts of colonial life; every step
they took was marked by ignorance of the A.B.C. of colonization and
bushmanship; and, after enduring fearful hardships, which the assist-
ance of fifty experienced Australian bushmen would have entirely
obviated, they were all ruined. Among other evils, land was granted
by the Home Government in a wildly profuse manner, but, from the
absence of a survey, was not allotted until years after the first settle-
ment of this colony.
But experience has abundantly proved that no matter how wisely
the colony of Swan River had been planned, it must have proved a
failure, for the following reasons :
First, although the climate is singularly genial, perhaps superior
to that of any other part of Australia, there is a very small proportion
of good land within the limits of the original settlement. What
there is lies in small patches in the midst of large tracts of absolutely
irreclaimable waste. Secondly, in addition to the want of cultivable
land, there is a great deficiency of pasture; with pastures equal to
those found in New South Wales and Port Philip, no bad management
could have prevented the eventual success of Swan River, for the
sheep and cattle would have gone on increasing, and an export of
wool and tallow would have been produced to pay for imports and for
immigrants. But the pastures are not only limited in extent, but in
many instances infected by the growth of a plant which is absolutely
poisonous to sheep and horned cattle ; and which horses do not eat.
Thirdly, the remote situation of Swan River not only made imports
costly, but prevented it from enjoying the commercial intercourse of
the settled districts, and rendered the importation of live stock most
difficult and costly. All the stock for Swan River had to be brought
by a long dangerous sea passage, in which, not unfrequently, the whole
live cargo perished. South Australia and Port Philip were largely
supplied overland.
The evil of the injudicious grants of land would have passed away
long since, had there been pasturage for a million sheep, but, for want
of that, or some other staple, the capital of the colony has been drained
away in paying for necessary imports in clothing, tea, sugar, &c.

long since, had there been pasturage for a million sheep, but, for want
of that, or some other staple, the capital of the colony has been drained
away in paying for necessary imports in clothing, tea, sugar, &c.
Attempts have been made to supply this deficiency by various


crops; wheat is unsaleable, although it grows well. The vine, the
fig, and the orange, flourish as luxuriantly as in Southern Europe,
but cannot be raised to compete in the markets close at hand and with
the cheap labour of those districts.
Every year for the last ten years some new discovery is announced,
which is to restore the fortunes of Western Australia ; sometimes in
a new tract of fine land; sometimes a forest of mahogany or sandal
wood; mines of silver, lead, copper, and precious stones have had their
turn, and there is no doubt about coal. But, so far, no means have
been discovered enabling capitalists to profitably employ labourers.
Therefore, although at some future period it is possible that the
fine climate, the valuable ship-building and furniture woods, and other
material resources, assisted by steam navigation, may render Western
Australia a thriving colony; at present, after more than twenty
years’ struggle, the advantages of settlement there, except to a limited
number of labourers, are entirely prospective.
An Association has been recently formed, under Act of Parliament,
termed the Colonization Assurance Land Company, with very ample
and extraordinary powers, which proposes to sell land at the rate of
£1 an acre, and take in payment annual premiums, on the life assur-
ance principle, for the life of the occupier; so that an annual payment
of some ten or twelve pounds per annum would secure the occupation
of 100 acres during life, and freehold after death of the first colonist.
The theory is pretty, but, in reality, only applicable to a state of
society where a crop can always be sold for cash. And that is not the
present state of Western Australia, nor any other Australian Colony.
Western Australia has recently been made a convict colony, to a
limited extent. The convicts are employed on public works, which
are much needed. It is reported that a very fine pastoral country has
been discovered near Sharks’ Bay, to the north of Swan River. Steam
navigation may perhaps cause this new district to be settled, if the
government do not interfere to prevent it.
VICTORIA, FORMERLY PORT PHILIP.
Victoria, called Australia Felix by Sir Thomas Mitchell, and
Philips-land by Dr. Lang, was first taken possession of in 1804, at the
suggestion of the enterprising navigator, Flinders; but the settlement
was abandoned. In 1824, Messrs. Hovel and Hume travelled over-
land from Isew South Wales, and reached Geelong, now the site of a
flourishing town and port of the same name. But, with the exception


crops; wheat is unsaleable, although it grows well. The vine, the
fig, and the orange, flourish as luxuriantly as in Southern Europe,
but cannot be raised to compete in the markets close at hand and with

was abandoned. In 1824, Messrs. Hovel and Hume travelled over-
land from Isew South Wales, and reached Geelong, now the site of a
flourishing town and port of the same name. But, with the exception


of a few flocks in the interior, and a few whaling parties on the
coast, no regular attempt at colonization was made until May 1835,
when a party of Van Diemen’s Land colonists formed themselves into
an association, and sailing across the narrow strait, settled on the
river Yarra Yarra, where the City of Melbourne has since been built.
Ihe Home Government—Lord Glenolg being then Colonial Minis-
ter —opposed the Port Philip colony in the most determined manner;
although Colonel Arthur, the Governor of Van Diemen’s Land, and
Sir It. Bourke, the Governor of New South Wales, both strongly urged
that the Crown should acknowledge and afford machinery for the
government of the new colony. Had it been possible, tbe settlers
would have been driven back by force of arms. Fortunately, Port
Philip was 16,000 miles from Downing Street. The reports of the
fine land, pasturage and climate of the new territory created an intense
sensation throughout Van Diemen’s Land. In 1837, the Government
were compelled to give way; and when Sir E. Bourke arrived at Mel-
bourne, as it is now called, he found nearly five hundred colonists,
with 150,000 fine-woolled sheep, upwards of 2000 horned cattle, and
150 horses, besides flocks and herds at Western Port and Portland Bay.
The first Government Land Sale took place in June 1837. A
mania, originating in the townland speculations of South Australia,
which will be presently explained, seized the colonists and the emi-
grating public, and by 1840 town and country land, to the extent of
nearly a quarter of a million sterling, had been sold by Government
and re-sold again and again at still more extravagant prices, for what
were considered choice lots, by private individuals. Emigrants
flocked from England : every one wanted to buy land, to buy stock,
to hire labour. More than one hundred ships were unloading in the
harbour at the same time. The wages of common labour were from
6s. to 10s. a-day, and stock doubled, trebled, and quadrupled in price.
From New South Wales overland, and from Van Diemen’s Land by
sea, there was a constant influx of sheep and cattle.
In 1839, Mr. Latrobe was appointed Superintendent. Up to that
time, this important province, distant 600 miles from the seat of Gov-
ernment, was managed by a few custom-house clerks, a couple of
magistrates, and a handful of police. Until a very recent period,
humble names and cheap arrangements have been sufficient to dis-
charge the governmental duties of a large, wealthy, and populous dis-
trict, without soldiers, colonial secretaries, or attorney-generals, or
other arrangements for caricaturing Home Governments.

of a few flocks in the interior, and a few whaling parties on the
coast, no regular attempt at colonization was made until May 1835,
when a party of Van Diemen’s Land colonists formed themselves into
an association, and sailing across the narrow strait, settled on the
river Yarra Yarra, where the City of Melbourne has since been built.
Ihe Home Government—Lord Glenolg being then Colonial Minis-
ter —opposed the Port Philip colony in the most determined manner;
although Colonel Arthur, the Governor of Van Diemen’s Land, and
Sir It. Bourke, the Governor of New South Wales, both strongly urged
that the Crown should acknowledge and afford machinery for the
government of the new colony. Had it been possible, tbe settlers
would have been driven back by force of arms. Fortunately, Port
Philip was 16,000 miles from Downing Street. The reports of the
fine land, pasturage and climate of the new territory created an intense
sensation throughout Van Diemen’s Land. In 1837, the Government
were compelled to give way; and when Sir E. Bourke arrived at Mel-
bourne, as it is now called, he found nearly five hundred colonists,
with 150,000 fine-woolled sheep, upwards of 2000 horned cattle, and
150 horses, besides flocks and herds at Western Port and Portland Bay.

The land and stock mania eventually arrived at its inevitable ter-


xnination: a general smash took place. The merchants in England
suffered severely for their credulity. Many of the Port Philip con-
signees paid for consignments with a schedule in the insolvent court.
The land purchasers were all but universally ruined. But while specu-
lators were ruined, the succulent pasture, the fertile land, and the mild
climate, which distinguish the Port Philip district, remained, and the
sheep and cattle fed and multiplied ; while the more prudent among
the labourers who had earned large wages and saved some money,
bought the stock and bits of land from their mad masters, lived on the
produce, and hired the labour, and sold the surplus in the towns. The
squatters of the interior, although in nominal value their flocks had
deteriorated, still had them, and were able to hire shepherds cheaper
than during the mania. These flocks increased wonderfully, for Port
Philip is one of the finest districts in the world for sheep, and the
exports steadily increased.
This colony may be considered the head-quarters of the squatting
interest, which is one reason of its pre-eminent prosperity. Many of
the squatters there live in a manner which would surprise any who
have not lately been in Australia. The rough life described in the
following pages belongs for the most part to another age, and a very
early period of the colony. In Port Philip, especially, may be met
squatters belonging to all the liberal professions, residing not in bark
huts, and living on chops and damper, but in substantial stone or
brick houses, with all the necessaries, and most of the luxuries of life.
An establishment, where thousands of pounds have been spent in
general improvements, is not uncommon. The English reader will
perhaps be struck to find under this barbarous name almost all the
territorial magistrates and country gentlemen. lie would be sur-
prised to find even in the remoter districts posts arriving regularly
twice a-week, bringing the local journals and letters. He would won-
der to hear of circulating libraries, reading societies, and book clubs.
He would be interested to see these euphoniously named gentlemen
administering the laws of England, attending their magisterial benches,
and interesting themselves in local concerns. He would be astonished
to hear of foxhounds, of hunters in training, and of studs taken out
to exercise as at Melton. Whence comes the wealth which such a
state of things betokens ? *

At the present time, —having never had the aid of a large govern-
ment expenditure, or the puffing publicity of English companies,
like the colonies of South Australia and New Zealand,—Port Philip
district contains upwards of 78,000 inhabitants by last census, six or
seven millions of sheep, half a million horned cattle, and a full propor-
tion of horses and other stock. The export of wool is greater than
from New South Wales, and the whole population is enjoying a high
degree of prosperity, as will bo seen from the statistical table appen-
ded. It is, and always has been, a self-supporting colony, having
never cost the mother country a single shilling, but having con-
tributed large sums to the Emigration Fund of New South Wales.
The amount of immigrants from the Ist of January to the 11th of
September, 1849, amounted to 6828 adults and 2611 children. This
large amount of emigration has, according to the report of the super-
intendent, dated November, 1849, been absorbed without the slighest
influence on the price of labour.
By an Act passed in the Session of 1850, Port Philip has been
erected into a separate province under the name of Victoria. The
colony has now an elective representative assembly, under provisions
which apply to the three groat colonies.
Victoria contains more fertile land near the sea than any of the
other colonies, and great tracts of undulating pastures, lightly tim-
bered, well watered with rivers and deep lagoons.
A chain of mountains running by Port Macedon, Port Cole, and
the Grampians, about sixty miles from the sea, divides the district to
the northward; inland, are boundless, dry, light plains, admirably
adapted for sheep, but not suitable for agriculture. These probably,
like many of the English downs, are destined to sheep pasturage for
ages. To the southward between these mountains and the sea is the
great agricultural district of Port Philip, in this respect presenting a
contrast to New South Wales, where the rich arable land is generally
a hundred or two hundred miles from a port. The richest portions of
Port Philip are to be found near Geelong, Mount Norret, Port Fairy,
and especially on the Wannou. We heard a settler, in delight at
this latter locality, exclaim, “Why, this country was made to order!”
Melbourne, the chief city, and the seat of a bishopric, stands on
two hills, sloping down towards the river Yarra, at a point where the
salt tide ends. To divide the sea from the fresh water a dam has been
built, which forms a pool on the sea side, where steamers, after pad-
dling up the narrow channel leading from the bay, can turn after dis-
charging their cargoes.

The population of Melbourne exceeds twenty-three thousand, and is
daily increasing. It contains the usual public buildings, churches,
and chapels of all denominations, and various institutions, to describe
which would be useless, as in so young and flourishing a colony
changes are taking place perpetually. The Prince’s Bridge, across the
Yarra, has one arch of 150 feet span, and cost £15,000. When a third
Episcopalian Church was required, £1350 was subscribed in one
morning toward £3500. The inhabitants are as liberal as thriving.
Melbourne has a municipal charter, under which its local affairs
are governed by a mayor, four aldermen, and twelve town councillors,
whose discussions are daily recorded in four daily, and two weekly
papers. In the suburbs are a botanic garden and a race-course.
The heads of Port Philip Bay are forty miles from the entrance to
the Yarra river, which is only navigable by steamers and small craft.
The Bay, from twenty to forty miles in breadth, narrows at the heads
to two miles, and has safe anchorage for the largest fleet that ever sailed.
All the shipping of large tonnage has at present to lie at Williams-
town, the bar in the river Yarra preventing vessels of more than four
hundred tons reaching the town, a distance of seven miles. This bar
it is thought can be removed; but a more eligible plan seems to be to
cut a slip canal, a mile and a half across a narrow neck of sand, from
the Yarra basin to the sea. This would enable ships of six hundred
tons to reach the heart of the town; and as the land presents every
facility, it would not he attended with a very great expense.
Melbourne was not originally intended for the chief town; hut the
want of fresh water drove the colonists from Sir Richard Bourke’s
selection of William’s Town on Gellibrand Point.
Brighton and St. Kilda are pretty villages, about six miles from
Melbourne, on the eastern side of Port Philip, in which the more
thriving citizens have villas, where they resort for sea-bathing in
summer.
The distance from Melbourne to Sydney by the road is about 600
miles. The whole way is studded with taverns, of one class or
another, and is constantly traversed by all clssses of passengers on
foot or horseback, and in all kinds of vehicles. The royal mail to
Sydney departs twice a-week, and runs the distance in six days; but
steamers plying to Sydney afford a better mode of transit.
Geelong, situated on the harbour of the same name, on the western
arm of Port Philip, is forty-five miles distant from Melbourne, and
only second in importance to the capital. It contains 7000 inhabi-

Melbourne ; but a bar which has only nine feet of water at high tide,
compels ships to lie six miles off, thus destroying what would other-
wise be a very important harbour; hopes are entertained of being able
to remove this bar, in which case Geelong will go a-head very fast.
Steamers ply several times a-day between Geelong and Melbourne.
The other thriving towns are Portland, on the bay of the same
name, 250 miles from Melbourne; Belfast, or Port Fairy ; and Alber-
ton, the port of Gipp’s Land.
Indications of coal have been found within thirty miles of Mel-
bourne, and in several other districts, but which have not yet been
worked.
Gold has already been gathered in small quantities. An active
search for this metal is now being prosecuted, and experienced geolo-
gists assert that it will be found as plentifully as in New South Wales
or California. In the meantime the chief exports are wool, tallow,
and preserved meats. The exportation of tallow for this year is ex-
pected to exceed £lOO,OOO in value.
Yine-yards have been cultivated with success.
By the last returns, Victoria exports more wool than New South
Wales. For the last five years the arrival of increasing numbers of
immigrants has steadily increased the demand. For great capitalists,
as squatters, for small farmers, and labourers of both sexes, this colony
offers great advantages, as its resources are solid, and of a character to
be developed by steady industry.
Although too many expirees (prisoners whose time has expired)
have been attracted from Van Diemen’s Land, by the great superiority
of this district, still, it cannot be considered as having experienced
the benefits of, or suffered the curse of, the convict system. It was never
used as a penal settlement, and the expirees, above alluded to, were
never sufficiently numerous to affect the population, or to form a party,
as they have in New South Wales. They have always disguised the
fact of their conviction, and been absorbed in the population. It is
but natural to suppose that such of them as have reformed should wish
to leave Van Diemen’s land, the scene of their punishment, and begin
afresh where they were unknown. Many have thus become indepen-

SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
South Australia is one of the most flourishing of British colonies,
although it neither possesses the ample pastures of New South Wales,


nor the agricultural and pastoral resources of Victoria, its principal
port is very inferior either to Port Jackson or Port Philip, and its chief
city, Adelaide, suffers from intense heat and dust, the result of its posi-
tion. But South Australia possesses one of the richest copper mines
in the world, and appearances, which justify the expectation, intimate
that at no distant period, other mines of copper, lead, and silver, will
not only afford employment to labourers, hut profit to other share-
holders, besides the fortunate proprietors of the great Burra Burra
Mine. The wheat of the province is of very fine quality, and horti-
culture has been carried on with great success. The climate at a
little distance from Adelaide is extremely agreeable, and although the
quantity of fertile land in proportion to the utterly barren, is less
than in the other colonies, there is enough to support a population of
some millions. In the number of harbours and navigable rivers the
first colonists were much disappointed. The finest river in the con-
tinent of Australia, the Murray, down which Captain Sturt nnd his
party descended in boats, when he discovered South Australia, ends
on the sea-shore in a shallow unnavigable lake. But from recent
investigations it seems that steam navigation is likely to be rendered
available on this river for upwards of five hundred miles; its banks
are already occupied by squatters and their flocks.
The parties to whom South Australia offers the greatest advantages
are miners, labourers, domestic servants of both classes, a limited
number of mechanics, farmers, and gardeners. Such parties, proposing
buy small lots of land, should cultivate it with their families, with
little or no hired labour. For farming after the English fashion, on the
scale of two or three hundred acres, there is no opening either in South
or any other part of Australia, unless it be on accommodation land,
for supplying vegetables to a large town. To parties inclined for
pastoral pursuits there is less land open in this colony than in the other
two. Capitalists in so thriving a place will find many opportunities of
advantageously investing their money at good interest. To those who
know nothing about mining, it is well to note, that while the shares in
the celebrated Burra Burra mine have increased in value from £5 to
£ 150, out of nearly ninety other schemes, some fifty of which have been
formed into joint-stock companies, not one has yet paid a dividend, and
all but two or three are at a discount. But the history of the colony
of South Australia is well worth the study of every intending emigrant,
as a warning against having anything to do with unknown colonies,
colonizing companies, and paper projects for model settlements in any
part of the world.

If people are compelled by hard necessity to quit the comforts of
civilized Europe, let them proceed to a country where beef and mutton
are already feeding, where crops are already growing, and, at least,
a few experienced colonists are already settled to assist them in their
apprenticeship to the rude life of a settler.
The idea of a colony in South Australia was first started by Mr.
Wakefield, under the shield of Mr. Gouger, in 1831, and after several
attempts an act was obtained in 1834. The principles of this new
colony, as described in a pamphlet written by Mr. E. G. Wakefield,
was to sell land in England to intending colonists, to be selected by
them on landing, at a price which he called a “ hired labour price,”
that is to say, a price so high that labourers should not be able for
two or three years to purchase land; an expedient by which he un-
dertook to make them go on continually working as labourers at wages
so as to enable “society to remain concentrated, engaged in agricul-
ture, preserving the same relations that exists in Europe between
the employer and employed, thus avoiding the dispersion of pastoral
pursuits.”
This “hired labour price,” or “sufficient price,” was to be devoted
to exporting labouring emigrants in pairs, of both sexes, without
children. “It was proposed to transplant, not people merely, but
society for, as Mr. Wakefield said, in the course of one of the many
works he wrote in praise of the scheme, “ Every capitalist going to the
colony will know that his want of labour is sure to be supplied. He
may take the number of servants he can employ along with him,
without cost, beyond the price of his land. What is far more impor-
tant, he will be* able to retain their services until others shall arrive
to take their places. In Canada, New South Wales, and other colonies,
servants taken out by capitalists, under engagement for a fixed period,
invariably quit their masters; because, in all those colonies, every one
can obtain land of his own for a mere trifle. South Australia will
be the first colony combining plenty of labour with plenty of land.”
It was in 1834 that he thus wrote, and the price to the first pur-
chasers was fixed at £Bl for 134 acres of country land and one acre
of town land. It was also a material part of Mr. Wakefield s plan
that a very large number of persons should go out at the same time;
“he would have no bit-by-bit colonization.” His was the very reverse
of the Port Philip colonization, where the sheep, with a few shepherds,
went first, and where the live-stock was always in advance of the colo-
nists. He observes, in the pamphlet before quoted:—“A large body of
colonists, comprising all ranks and conditions, and a sufficient number

Wakefield, under the shield of Mr. Gouger, in 1831, and after several
attempts an act was obtained in 1834. The principles of this new
colony, as described in a pamphlet written by Mr. E. G. Wakefield,
was to sell land in England to intending colonists, to be selected by
them on landing, at a price which he called a “ hired labour price,”
that is to say, a price so high that labourers should not be able for
two or three years to purchase land; an expedient by which he un-
dertook to make them go on continually working as labourers at wages
so as to enable “society to remain concentrated, engaged in agricul-
ture, preserving the same relations that exists in Europe between
the employer and employed, thus avoiding the dispersion of pastoral
pursuits.”
This “hired labour price,” or “sufficient price,” was to be devoted
to exporting labouring emigrants in pairs, of both sexes, without
children. “It was proposed to transplant, not people merely, but
society for, as Mr. Wakefield said, in the course of one of the many
works he wrote in praise of the scheme, “ Every capitalist going to the
colony will know that his want of labour is sure to be supplied. He
may take the number of servants he can employ along with him,
without cost, beyond the price of his land. What is far more impor-
tant, he will be* able to retain their services until others shall arrive
to take their places. In Canada, New South Wales, and other colonies,
servants taken out by capitalists, under engagement for a fixed period,
invariably quit their masters; because, in all those colonies, every one
can obtain land of his own for a mere trifle. South Australia will
be the first colony combining plenty of labour with plenty of land.”
It was in 1834 that he thus wrote, and the price to the first pur-
chasers was fixed at £Bl for 134 acres of country land and one acre
of town land. It was also a material part of Mr. Wakefield s plan
that a very large number of persons should go out at the same time;
“he would have no bit-by-bit colonization.” His was the very reverse
of the Port Philip colonization, where the sheep, with a few shepherds,
went first, and where the live-stock was always in advance of the colo-
nists. He observes, in the pamphlet before quoted:—“A large body of
colonists, comprising all ranks and conditions, and a sufficient number


of each class for the division of labour and combination, on which
depends division of employments, is indispensable, In colonization,
as in war, it is always wise to operate with masses. By a series of
petty expeditions, the social force of the colony would he divided.”
Experience has proved that every one of these colonizing canons
is false. A high price of land will not afford a supply of labour at
European or moderate rates, nor preserve the ranks of society, nor
division of labour. Great armies of colonists landing on a virgin
shore, largely increase the cost and the pains of colonization.
A South Australian Company was formed to purchase land, open
a hank, feed sheep, farm, carry on whaling, and do every thing, on a
splendid scale. The price of land was raised to 20s. an acre, and
before the surveyors could get to work, the emigrants were poured in
upon them by the enthusiastic Commissioners, in July, 1836. People
bought land in 1836, 1837, and 1838, just as they bought railway-
shares in 1845-6. The first arrivals selected their town-acres in
the most favourable sites, cut them into lots, and sold them at
advanced prices, until land, in a mere village of huts and tents,
reached £IOOO an acre, and a wooden house, of the size of six
sentry-boxes, let for £IOO a-year. It has been usual to put blame
on the surveyors, on the two governors, on the home government, on
everyone except the true delinquents, the commissioners, their oracles,
Mr. Wakefield, and the colonists themselves. A great number of
gentleman of the first-class, some of considerable fortune, arrived, after
having made large purchases of land in England, imagining that they
were going to live the life of English country gentlemen, on colonial
estates bought at £1 an acre. Wages immediately rose to an enor-
mous rate, which was inevitable, for, as the commissioners kept selling
land and sending out colonists, labour was wanted for roads, piers,
houses, gardens, public offices, all at the same time, the wealthy and
helpless class all wanted work done, and competed with each other
for it.
Nothing was grown : the colonists were too busy building a town
and speculating, to attend to agriculture. They lived on imported
capital, and produced nothing. The unexpected arrival of herds and
flocks over-land, saved South Australia from absolute famine; as it was,
indifferent horses and cows fetched £IOO each, and sheep £5 a-head.
Wool-growing, the only thing that would have afforded an export,
was neglected. In 1838 there were not 3000 ewes in the colony.
Everybody speculated ; everybody lived extravagantly and genteelly;
and, as long as new colonists, with capital, kept arriving, the game


of each class for the division of labour and combination, on which
depends division of employments, is indispensable, In colonization,
as in war, it is always wise to operate with masses. By a series of
petty expeditions, the social force of the colony would he divided.”

went on. Nothing could he more agreeable or more ruinous than
life in Adelaide, where a crowd of well-educated enthusiasts, instead
of looking after wool-growing, or wheat-growing, concentrated, and
kept each other in countenance with axioms of the new art of
colonization.
The governor, Colonel Gawler, appointed after the recall of the
first governor, Captain Hindmarsh, had a salary of £BOO a-year,
when flour was £lOO a ton, and out of his fortune kept a little court,
where, surrounded by parasites, he deluded himself into the idea that
the luxury so suddenly transplanted into a desert, was real prosperity.
He built a government house, at a cost of £24,000, and made a much-
needed road, of seven miles, across the swamp which lay between the
port and the city, which cost nearly the same sum. It is the fashion
among ill-informed pupils of Mr. Wakefield’s school to attribute the
ruin of South Australia to Colonel Gawler’s extravagance. A silly
and malicious fable. Colonel Gawler spent his own money and the
money of the people of England, and the colony had the benefit of the
expenditure. Without that expenditure, which advertised and puffed
the bubble, it would probably have been abandoned immediately after
his arrival there, and the colonists would never have waited to dis-
cover the copper mine which saved the colony.
At length a pause took place; and then a universal smash. Capi-
talists ceased to arrive, bills could no longer be renewed, or land be
sold. As credits closed, insolvency followed, and, both agricultural
and pastoral pursuits having been neglected by the great mass of the
population, they had nothing to fall back on; they had all been
spending without producing. Colonel Gawler was recalled; bills
were protested, which the government afterwards paid to the extent
of £250,000.
Many re-emigrated, the rest turned their attention to the real
work of colonization labour. Men who had landed with £20,000
were destitute ; men who had landed without a shilling, were in pos-
session of comfortable farms, although very little money.
Captain Grey, now Sir George Grey, succeeded Colonel Gawler,
but his was an easy task, he had all the benefit of the expenditure of
his predecessor;—while the working colonists set to work to produce
something, he applied himself to cut down expenditure. During
Colonel Gawler’s time provisions and every necessary, as well as
wages, were all at enormously high rates. With general insolvency
the demand ceased, everything became cheap, and cheap government
became possible. Very soon cultivation outgrew the demand, and


went on. Nothing could he more agreeable or more ruinous than

farmers had crops of wheat for which there were no customers. The
tenants of the South Australian Companies could not afford to pay-
rent except in kind.
Under these circumstances, in 1844, the colony, having passed
through a crisis, did not thrive, but just vegetated. Men who culti-
vated the soil lived, but could make no money. The only export was
a little wool raised by squatters and by holders of small allotments,
who fed over the unoccupied sections of absentee land purchasers.
Land sale had almost ceased; the payment of the heavy debt due to
the Home Government seemed impossible.
The only staple export of the colony was the much despised wool,
and all the fine stories about concentration, hired labour price, and
balance of labour and capital, were forgotten or cursed in secret by
unhappy colonists ruined by the delusion.
In 1842, the total debts of a colony which was to have been an
illustration of self-supporting colonization, were £400,000, besides
the large capital sunk and lost by enthusiastic colonists. Out of
2000 houses in Adelaide, 650 were totally deserted in that same year;
136 writs passed through the Sheriff’s Court, and owners of hundreds
of acres of land worked their way home before the mast.
When all the inducements holdout to colonists of capital in 1835-6
by Mr. Wakefield in his pamphlets and newspaper articles had failed,
the accidental discovery of a copper mine turned the scale, preventing
South Australia from becoming as destitute as Swan River.
The first mine discovered was the Kapunda. The discoverer, Mr.
Dutton, has written a work on the mines of the colony, in which,
oddly enough, he scarcely mentions the mine which has provided
two-thirds of the total exports of South Australia ever since 1846.
The Burra Burra mine was included in a special survey of 20,000
acres at the fixed price of £20,000, which was purchased, in 1845, by
a union of all parties in Adelaide, commonly called the nobs and the
snobs, who together collected almost every sovereign in the colony to
pay the required sum in due time.
As soon as they had secured the special survey, they agre.ed to
divide it; the officials and gentlemen, or nobs, taking one ten
thousand acres, and the tradesmen, or snobs, the other. A toss up
decided the question; to the snobs fell the half named Burra Burra,
to the nobs the other named Princess Royal, now not worth 25 per
cent, of original shares. Operations commenced on the 29th Sept.,
1845.
In 1850, the whole transactions of the company were balanced up

In 1850, the whole transactions of the company were balanced up


to the 29th Sept., 1849, when it appeared that a capital of £12,250 had
purchased the estate and raised 37,736 tons of copper ore, which
produced in the province £536,486, leaving a profit of £226,661.
In 1850, a profit of £62,000 has been distributed in dividends.
With such a solid source of wealth, added to expenditure of other
mining companies, in some of which the yield of ore is considerable,
although the profits are nil , the colony has gone a-head. To the
exports of copper ore may be added the wool of a million sheep, and
a little tallow.
The South Australian Company, after having lost money in
whaling, agriculture, sheep farming, mining, and other similar expe-
riments, has been able, in some degree, to retrieve its original losses
by the increased value which the mines have given to its building
and some of its agricultural land, and having ceased to be a colonizing
has become an absentee land leasing company.
The city of Adelaide, the seat of a bishopric, is situated in a plea-
sant valley on the river Torrens, a small stream in which children are
sometimes drowned in the rainy season, and over which they can
usually paddle during nine months of the year. It is distant eight miles
from the port, with which it is connected by a macadamized road, over
which cars and omnibuses continually ply. A railroad is in contem-
plation. The population is about twenty-five thousand, distributed
over ground planned out on a very large scale, giving an agreeable
rural air to the streets, which are intersected by fields, trees, and
flower-gardens. A public park forms a sort of boulevard round the
town.
The newspapers, literary institutions, and society of Adelaide, are
above average. The commercial ability of the people excessive, stimu-
lated no doubt by the uncertainty of mining pursuits.
The Burra mine is distant about ninety miles from Port Adelaide,
in a barren district, separated from the Port by a lofty range of hills,
over which there will be some difficulty in carrying a tramway. The
small farmers have reaped a great harvest in carrying for the mining
establishments with their bullock drays. Attempts have been made
to smelt the copper ore on the spot instead of shipping it for that
purpose to Swansea, but the want of fuel has rendered all the attempts
hitherto made unprofitable.
A mine of good coal within an easy distance of Port Adelaide
would be more valuable than even a discovery of gold. An immense
trade with China and India would be created immediately.
Several flourishing German colonies are established in South

Australia, which altogether is one of the safest colonies for the indus-
trious and hard-handed. It has sometimes suffered a little from the
excessive injudicious praises of enthusiastic friends.
There are many pleasant villages in the neighbourhood of Adelaide,
but no ports except Port Adelaide of any importance.
LAND PURCHASE AND LEASE.
Important changes have been made within the last few years in
the terms on which land may be purchased and leased in the three
flourishing colonies of Australia. In New South Wales and Port
Philip, a certain number of lots of land for farms are put up at the
quarterly sales by auction in thirty-acre lots, and accommodation
land near towns in still smaller quantities. In South Australia eighty
acres is the usual size of lot put up for auction in country lands. In
the two first colonies special surveys of twenty thousand acres may be
obtained at £1 an acre. In South Australia special surveys have been
abolished since the discovery of mines; no doubt the same course will
be followed in New South Wales. Small lots of land may be fre-
quently obtained on advantageous terms from private parties, with a
certain credit; but an emigrant, who is wise, will never buy land until
he has [seen it. Leases of land are still more to be avoided, and,
without a clause giving the right of purchase at a fixed price within a
certain time, should not be entertained. But until a man has acquired
a certain degree of colonial experience, he will do better not to meddle
with more land than he can cultivate with his own family.
The Governor of South Australia, Sir Henry Young, reports, that
he does not know one farmer hiring labour, and profitably employing
capital, in the English sense of the term, although there afe a large
number of thriving freehold working farmers. For this and other
reasons, it is better to land quite unhampered by land contracts.
The land required for pastoral purposes was formerly held from
year to year, and under so uncertain a tenure, that the squatters often
lived in a very rude manner, but now a system of leases, for one, eight,
and fourteen years, has been established, with a right of purchasing
at the lowest upset price, and a claim for compensation for unex-
hausted improvements. Under these arrangements the squatters,
many of whom hold the place of gentlemen-farmers and country
gentlemen in England, live in the bush in great comfort, with good
houses, good gardens, and many luxuries.

couples, to be repaid by instalments from the colony. This society,
which is under the patronage of the Earl of Shaftesbury, the Right
Hon. Sidney Herbert, and several other noblemen and gentlemen, sent
out, in the twelve months ending September 1851, three ships, the
Slains Castle, the Blundell, and the Athenian, with about seven hun-
dred emigrants, in enclosed berths, at a cost of about £l2 10s. 6d.
of which the total cost, about five-sixths, was paid by the emigrants,
and the rest lent by the subscribers to this society. The arrange-

ments; and, under certain circumstances, a loan is made to married
couples, to be repaid by instalments from the colony. This society,
which is under the patronage of the Earl of Shaftesbury, the Right
Hon. Sidney Herbert, and several other noblemen and gentlemen, sent
out, in the twelve months ending September 1851, three ships, the
Slains Castle, the Blundell, and the Athenian, with about seven hun-
dred emigrants, in enclosed berths, at a cost of about £l2 10s. 6d.
of which the total cost, about five-sixths, was paid by the emigrants,
and the rest lent by the subscribers to this society. The arrange-
ments secure protection for young single women and friendless
children during the voyage.

In 1848, the land in cultivation amounted to 37,500 acres. A large increase
has taken place since, especially in vineyards.
An extensive German immigration has commenced.
Out of the exports in 1848, £654,938 were the produce of the flocks.
The system of husbandry is wretched, but the soil most fertile. Mr. J. F.
Leslie Forster relates, in his work on Port Philip, that on one of his farms, near
Melbourne, a crop of potatoes was grown in which many tubers weighed upwards
of two pounds. Many plants had a stone weight of potatoes at their root. In
another instance, upon an irrigated piece of ground, the produce was 23 tons
per acre.
In 1849, the exports from all the Australian colonies were £2,880,620; the
imports, £2,889,730.

In the ’y ear 1616, New Holland, which is situated between lati-
tude 10° and 39” south, and longitude 113° and 153° east, was dis-
covered by the Dutch, by whom the western part was then called
New Holland. The whole island, or rather continent, measuring
from east to west about 2,500, and from north to south 2,000 geogra-
phical miles, is nearly the size of Europe. The colony, which forms
the subject of the following remarks, lies along the coast on the east
side of this continent, and generally goes under the name of New
South Wales.
The now occupied part of this colony extends from Moreton Bay
on the north to Port Phillip on the south, including a line of coast of
nearly 1,300 geographical miles, and inlands to a distance of from 200
to 300 miles, thus already embracing an extent of territory equal to
three times that of England and Scotland put together.
In a work like this it is not necessary to enter into the circum-
stances which led to the formation of the colony. Every one knows
that it was originally planned as a penal settlement, and intended
merely as a gaol for Great Britain and Ireland.

Sydney , out of compliment to Lord Sydney, the principal Secretary of
State for the Home Department, who greatly promoted the expedi-

four cows, one stallion, three colts and three mares. This was the
commencement of what is now the most flourishing colony belonging
to the British Crown.
No climate can be more salubrious than that of New South "Wales.
It is the climate for invalids. The air is bracing, pure, and balmy.
The atmosphere, owing to its great capacity for absorbing moisture,
is generally dry. Mr. Martin, a very interesting writer, says on this
subject, “the salubrity of Australia is proverbial. Of a community
of 1,200 persons, only five or six have been known to be sick at a
time; and at some of the military stations seven years have elapsed
without the loss of a man. Old people arrived in the colony from
Europe have suddenly found themselves restored to much of the
hilarity of youth; and I have seen several persons upwards of 100
years of age.” This testimony from Mr. Martin exactly coincides
with what I myself have repeatedly noticed at various periods, and
in different parts of this colony. As Mr. Martin visited Parramatta,
I think it probable that, when writing the above paragraph, he had
in his mind’s eye, among others, the following individuals, whose
obituaries may interest you. I copy them from a collection I made
some years ago for my own amusement. “In 1835, died, at Parra-
matta, Elizabeth Eccles, aged 105. She arrived in the first fleet,
aged 57 ; was bom in 1730, at Stratford-on-Avon. Same year (1835),
at Toongabbee, near Parramatta, Catherine Defihey, in the 100th
year of her age. Died at Seven Hills, near Parramatta, William
Marks, in his 102nd year. This man had been a soldier in the British
army, and fought at the battle of Bunker’s Hill, in the United States.”
Here the fever and ague of North America are unknown. Colonel
Gawler, late Governor of South Australia, speaking of this country,
says, “ I never saw a spot or heard of a climate more calculated to
restore debilitated constitutions.” I have often slept out in the bush
both in summer and winter, under the open canopy of heaven, and
never have felt the least inconvenience from it. But this is nothing
extraordinary; we have here hundreds of bullock-drivers and carriers,
who are for several weeks, in winter as well as in summer, without
ever putting their heads under the roof of a house, sleeping, when
night overtakes them, in the open air, with perfect impunity.

Wales can scarcely be said to have any winters at all. The summer
heat is seldom oppressive, and in Sydney snow and frost are unknown.
The heat of this colony has often heen represented as something very
alarming. I have for many years carefully watched and registered
the degrees of heat, as indicated by my thermometer. The highest to
which the mercury rose in the sun within my recollection was 127
degrees of Fahrenheit. This happened on the 16th January, 1837.
I copy the following note exactly as it stands in my register:—
“ Monday, 16 th January , 1837.—The thermometer at half-past
twelve stood, in the sun, at 127° F.; in the shade, 118°; in the sun,
at half-past four o’clock, p.m., 90°; in the shade, ditto, 86°; in the
house, at eight o’clock, evening, 85°; fall in four hours, 37° F. This
day ended in thunder and lightning.”
“ The weather has been raining, with little intermission, since the
evening of Monday, the 16th January, up to this date, Saturday, 21st
January, 1837.”
The following table, showing the mean, and highest , and lowest
state of the thermometer (in the shade) at Port Jackson Head, New
South Wales, will give a tolerably correct idea of our extreme heat
and cold ;

From the above table it will be seen that at Sydney the average
temperature of our coldest month, viz., July, is 53°, and of our
warmest months, viz., January and February, is 75°. I have lately
seen living, under an overhanging rock near Sydney, an old man, a
native of the Emerald Isle, who informed me that he had lived there
for the last few years in order to save rint, as house rint was too dear
in Sydney, and that he enjoyed better health under the rock than he
ever did in their fine houses.
We are occasionally visited with tremendous thunder-storms, ac-
companied by hailstones of incredible dimensions. I have seen them

From the above table it will be seen that at Sydney the average
temperature of our coldest month, viz., July, is 53°, and of our
warmest months, viz., January and February, is 75°. I have lately
seen living, under an overhanging rock near Sydney, an old man, a
native of the Emerald Isle, who informed me that he had lived there
for the last few years in order to save rint, as house rint was too dear
in Sydney, and that he enjoyed better health under the rock than he
ever did in their fine houses.
We are occasionally visited with tremendous thunder-storms, ac-
companied by hailstones of incredible dimensions. I have seen them
more than an inch in circumference. Lambs are sometimes killed by
them; and the destruction occasioned hy them among birds, fruit-
trees, vineyards, &c., is very great. At one time I have had within


ten minutes no fewer than forty panes of glass broken in my house
by hailstones.
In Sydney we seldom experience frost; hut in the interior of the
colony, water exposed to the night air in winter is found in the morn-
ing to be covered with a layer of ice of the thickness of a penny piece.
This I have often seen on the Hume River. At Argyle, Bathurst,
the upper parts of the Hume River district, and several other places
of elevation, snow frequently falls during the latter half of July and
former half of August. That the appearance of snow in Sydney
would he regarded as a remarkable phenomenon, the following para-
graph, from a Sydney paper of date 30th June, 1836, will show. The
article is headed “ Snowy Tuesday ” :
“ Tuesday last, the 28th instant, will he memorable in the annals
of Sydney, as the day on which its inhabitants were favoured for the
first time with the sight of snow. It reminded us of home more than
anything we had ever seen in the colony. Every flake of snow
seemed to he singing, as it fell, Dulce, dulce dotnum! Home, sweet
home ! The fall was by no means considerable in Sydney, although
it was two inches deep towards Parramatta; it lay for an hour or
more on the tops of houses and in other similar situations ; and the
Sydney boys were seen for the first time in their lives making snow-
balls. The day was very cold throughout. We never felt it so cold
before in Sydney.”
In Sydney and its neighbourhood there occasionally blows a hot
wind, which continues for a few hours, and raises the thermometer
sometimes to 120° Fahrenheit; but is almost invariably succeeded by
what is here called “ a hrickfielder,” which is a strong southerly wind,
which soon cools the air, and greatly reduces the temperature.
Our longest day is from five, a.m., to seven, p.m., or fourteen
hours ; and our shortest day is from seven, a.m., to five, p.m., or ten
hours, reckoning from sunrise to sunset. Our shortest day is the
21st June, and our longest day is the 22nd December.
The very dwelling-houses erected in the interior of this colony
hear testimony to the salubrity of our climate. Some of the wealthiest
settlers live in huts formed of a few slabs placed vertically with sheets
of bark as a roof. These slabs are often placed so widely apart that
a man might thrust his hand through the interstices. And yet with
only this rude accommodation, such is the general healthiness of the
people, that medical practitioners frequently complain that this climate
affords hut few chances for the exercise of their vocation. According
to a high medical authority, consumption is the disease which carries

to a high medical authority, consumption is the disease which carries


off a quarter of the British population. That such should be the fact
will readily be credited by any man living in New South Wales after
having spent some years in Great Britain. It is truly distressing to
listen to the endless chorus of coughing that goes on in the churches
of Scotland during the winter season. It reminds one of Eachel
mourning for her children, and refusing to be comforted. In this
colony there are many consumptive patients, with some of whom I
am personally acquainted, who, according to the opinion of their
medical advisers, have, in all probability, added several years to their
lives by emigrating to Australia.
The soil of Australia is generally poor, and is better adapted for
grazing than for agricultural purposes; but to this rule there are
many exceptions. In various parts of the colony there are extensive
tracts of land remarkable for fertility, yielding during several years
in succession, without any manure, from 30 to 40 bushels of wheat,
or from 50 to 60 bushels of maize, per acre. In the valley of the
Hume River I have seen 300 bushels of wheat raised from eight acres,
and it was the third crop of wheat from the same land without any
manure. I have seen seven successive crops of wheat raised from the
same field, which had never been manured by the hand of man, and
yet the seventh crop averaged 25 bushels to the acre. At Moreton
Bay, 80 bushels of maize (Indian corn) have been repeatedly raised
from one acre. From four to five tons of potatoes per acre are con-
sidered an average crop. Of onions, no less a quantity than 10 tons
have been raised from a single acre of land; and this same acre
would in the same season yield a crop of 50 or 60 bushels of maize
after the onion crop had been secured.
The tobacco plant grows well here ; and you are that there
is no duty on colonial-made tobacco. A large proportion of what is
now used in the colony is raised and manufactured by the settlers ;
and some of it, made on the Hunter’s River, was actually seized in
Sydney by the Custom House officers, who declared it to be American
negrohead! However, on their being convinced of their mistake, the
tobacco thus seized was released. It sells in Sydney at from Is. to
2s. per lb.; while negrohead, on which there is a duty of 2s. per lb.,
sells at 3s. 2d. per lb.
New South Wales is the very soil and climate for the vine; it
grows to great perfection here. The late Sir John Jamieson and
several other landed proprietors made some good wine, and in large
quantities, from the produce of their own vineyards. It must, how-
ever, be admitted that, with perhaps the exception of Cape wine, our

quantities, from the produce of their own vineyards. It must, how-
ever, be admitted that, with perhaps the exception of Cape wine, our


colonial-made wine is inferior to any of our imported wines. This
inferiority is, doubtless, to be attributed to our want of the requisite
skill in the manufacture ; for our grapes are universally allowed to be
of first-rate quality.
Except gardens and orchards, no cultivated land is manured in this
colony. Straw-yards are here unknown : the cattle are all the year
grazing in the forest, and every farmer, living at a distance from
Sydney, burns his straw as so much useless rubbish. lam acquainted
with a wealthy settler on the banks of the Paterson Elver, who built
all his corn-stacks close to the stream, where, having thrashed them
out, he caused all the straw to be thrown into the river, in order to
save the trouble and expense of burning. The newly-arrived emi-
grant will feel inclined to ask, 14 Is the soil of Australia of such a
nature as not to be improved by manure ?” The reply to this ques-
tion is, that though the soil would, beyond all doubt, be greatly im-
proved by manure, yet land is here so cheap and labour so high, that,
until there is a material change in the price of these two commodi-
ties, the present system of throwing away the manure is likely to
continue.
Barley grows well here : oats are also cultivated; but our soil is
rather too warm for this grain. Except in a few elevated situations,
such as Argyle, Bathurst, &c., the soil of New South Wales is also too
warm for apples, gooseberries, and currants.
In our gardens we have, besides several others, the following
fruits and vegetables:—pears, plums, cherries, apricots, peaches,
grapes, nectarines, figs, oranges, and lemons; also carrots, parsnips,
turnips, cauliflowers, asparagus, broccoli, onions, cabbages, potatoes,
pumpkins, rock and water melons, cucumbers, vegetable marrow, and
peas. We have green peas during the whole winter. In the Sydney
market, fruits and vegetables are remarkably cheap. Grapes are now
(March, 1845,) sold here at twopence per lb., and large ripe peaches
at one penny per dozen. But except those whose business or inclina-
tion confines them to the heart of a town, no man in this colony needs
be without a garden, where he may have abundance of all the above-
named productions growing at his door. It has now been clearly
ascertained that all tropical and European fruits grow to perfection in
one part or other of the colony of New South Wales. Yet, though
the soil and climate are thus so extremely favourable for the produc-
tion of fruits and vegetables, it is a singular fact that, throughout the
whole extent of the Australian forest, the white man finds nothing on
which he can subsist. Nature has done much for Australia; but,


colonial-made wine is inferior to any of our imported wines. This
inferiority is, doubtless, to be attributed to our want of the requisite
skill in the manufacture ; for our grapes are universally allowed to be

market, fruits and vegetables are remarkably cheap. Grapes are now
(March, 1845,) sold here at twopence per lb., and large ripe peaches
at one penny per dozen. But except those whose business or inclina-
tion confines them to the heart of a town, no man in this colony needs
be without a garden, where he may have abundance of all the above-
named productions growing at his door. It has now been clearly
ascertained that all tropical and European fruits grow to perfection in
one part or other of the colony of New South Wales. Yet, though
the soil and climate are thus so extremely favourable for the produc-
tion of fruits and vegetables, it is a singular fact that, throughout the
whole extent of the Australian forest, the white man finds nothing on
which he can subsist. Nature has done much for Australia; but,


until the arrival of the English, art has done nothing for her; and,
therefore, the white man who loses himself in what is here called
“the hush,” is really to be pitied. Many have so lost their way, and
perished miserably.

SEED TIME AND HARVEST —TILLAGE, CLEARING AND FENCING.
Our chief crops are wheat, maize (Indian corn), barley, oats, and
potatoes. By a return now in the Colonial Secretary’s office, I find
that the quantity of land in cultivation (exclusive of gardens and
orchards) within the boundaries of the colony of New South Wales
and Port Phillip, in the year 1842, was;—Acres of wheat, 57,533 ;
maize, 26,192; barley, 4,817; oats, 4,235; millet, 99; potatoes,
4,768; tobacco, 223; rye, 473; sown grass, 17,320; Total, 115,660.
The produce of the above quantity of land has for that year been, in
bushels—746,22B wheat; 559,719 maize; 82,624 barley; 81,311
oats; 4,402 rye; 1,201 millet; 11,676 tons potatoes; 2,010 cwt.
tobacco; and 16,676 tons of hay. Wheat may be sown any time
between the Ist day of March and the last day of June. From Ito
1| bushel (varying in quantity according to the quality of the soil) is
enough to sow an acre; the poorer the soil is, the larger is the quantity
of seed required. Until within the last few years, our wheat crops
were very liable to be injured by smut; to prevent whicli, the follow-
ing means, now I believe generally used throughout the colony, have
been found effectual. The day before we intend sowing, we half fill
a cask with water, in which we dissolve a couple of ounces of blue-
stone for every bushel of wheat we intend steeping in it. The wheat
is allowed to remain steeping in this solution from two to four hours,
after which time it is taken out and spread to dry on the floor until
the following day, when it is sown. I have never known any smut
to affect wheat the seed of which has been thus prepared.
Wheat harvest is from November to January; late reaping may
be occasioned by any, or all, of the following causes: late sowing, wet
season, cold soil, southern exposure, or elevated situation. In several
places near the sea coast, such as the Hawkesbury and Hunter’s


until the arrival of the English, art has done nothing for her; and,
therefore, the white man who loses himself in what is here called
“the hush,” is really to be pitied. Many have so lost their way, and

be occasioned by any, or all, of the following causes: late sowing, wet

places near the sea coast, such as the Hawkesbury and Hunter’s


Rivers, to the north of Sydney, the wheat crops are secured before
the end of November; in other words, as in the corresponding latitude
in Judea, “the harvest is past before the summer is ended.” —Jer.
viii. 20.
Reaping is a very different process in Australia from what it is
with you in England. As straw is of very little use here, the wheat
is reaped at the height of two or three feet from the ground, the only
object of the farmer being to secure the ears or grain, and to encumber
his barn with as little as he can of the straw. Such is our fine climate,
that if the crop is ripe and the weather fair, the sheaves may be led
and stacked the very day after reaping. When men are hired to
thrash it, they are usually paid at the rate of 6d. or 7d. per bushel,
without rations. Wheat is now selling at from 2s. 9d. to 4s. per
bushel, weighing upwards of GOlbs. Maize (Indian corn), which is
chiefly used for feeding horses and pigs, is sown in October and
November, and is ripe in May and June. It is sown, or rather planted,
in holes six feet apart, and four or five grains in each hole. It re-
quires, like potatoes, to be hoed at different stages of its progress in
growth. It is generally a very abundant crop, averaging, on good
soil, from fifty to sixty bushels per acre. Maize, as might be expected,
is a scourging crop, and requires very strong soil. The straw or
stalks are of no use whatever to the farmer. Maize is usually the
first crop which the Australian settler raises from his cleared land;
and, as it is reaped in May or June, there is just sufficient time left to
the settler to enable him to sow the same land with wheat, and thus
reap two valuable crops within six or seven months. The knowledge
of this fact, trifling as it is, may be of use to intending emigrants who
wish to lose no time after their arrival in the colony. About five
years ago, when wheat was scarce in New South Wales, maize flour
was very much used. Mixed with an equal quantity of wheaten
flour, it makes very palatable and wholesome bread, far superior to
either the barley or oaten cakes used by the poorer classes in
Scotland.
June is the proper time for sowing oats and barley. Oats are
generally cut green , when the ear is full, and before it begins to ripen,
for hay. There is an immense quantity of this oaten hay sent weekly
to the Sydney market, where it now sells at from £3 to £4 per ton.
Horses thrive well on it, and generally prefer it to lucerne, for which
our soil or climate appears not to be well adapted.
Barley is consumed in large quantities by our distillers and
brewers. It is also found, when cut green, to be an excellent substi-

our soil or climate appears not to be well adapted.
Barley is consumed in large quantities by our distillers and
brewers. It is also found, when cut green, to be an excellent substi-


tute for hay to feed horses kept in the stable. By sowing a patch of
it for this latter purpose at different times of the year, the settler may
always have a bundle of cooling and nourishing green barley for his
horse. Potatoes may he planted at almost any time of the year.
Potatoes that were planted in January, February, March, April, May,
June, October, November, and December, have all yielded good crops.
This is a matter of great importance to the newly-arrived emigrant,
who may have a large family to feed —especially if he is an Irishman.
The late Mr. Shepherd, a scientific and practical gardener, who lived
for many years near Sydney, recommended to plant potatoes in April,
May, or June, for spring crops; and for an autumn crop, to plant
them in December and January. In his garden he used to raise from
ten to twelve tons of potatoes from one acre. lie published a little
work on gardening, containing much useful information, chiefly the
result of his own practical experience. Sweet potatoes are raised
about Moreton Bay, where also yams, arrow-root, and New Zealand
flax are now cultivated. Like potatoes, turnips, onions, and peas may
be sown at any time of the year.
Some of our crops are liable to he injured by blight, smut, cater-
pillars, or weevil. Blight is occasioned by frosts when wheat is in
blossom. Smut may be prevented by the adoption of the means
which I have already described. The only remedy which I have seen
employed against the destructive progress of caterpillars is to plough
a few furrows across their path. The weevil, which is very destruc-
tive to both wheat and maize, is a little insect, which penetrates the
husk, eats the flour, and leaves nothing hut the shell. I have
repeatedly seen my corn-chest rendered one black heap The corn
thus injured is apt to give horses which eat it the “ gripes.”
Ploughing is chiefly done here by bullocks. They arc cheaper,
more easily fed, and go more steadily than horses, io plough half
an acre of heavy ground or about three quarters of light ground, is
considered a good day’s work for a team of six or eight bullocks. Our
ploughs are generally made of wood, and are very rough. They
answer best among the roots which abound in almost every field.
Besides, if a wooden plough is broken, it is easily mended, as every
farming establishment, however small, is supplied with tools sufficient
to mend or make the common agricultural implements.
In selecting a spot on his land for a cultivation paddock, the
settler looks out for a combination of the following requisites : —Good
soil, free from timber; a sufficient fall to allow the winter rain to run
off it; a northern exposure to the sun, and to be situated at a con-


tute for hay to feed horses kept in the stable. By sowing a patch of
it for this latter purpose at different times of the year, the settler may
always have a bundle of cooling and nourishing green barley for his
horse. Potatoes may he planted at almost any time of the year.

In selecting a spot on his land for a cultivation paddock, the
settler looks out for a combination of the following requisites : —Good
soil, free from timber; a sufficient fall to allow the winter rain to run
off it; a northern exposure to the sun, and to be situated at a con-


venient distance from Ms residence. It sometimes happens that such
a combination of natural advantages cannot he found, and, in that case,
the settler is obliged to supply Nature’s deficiency by his own labour
and industry. He may find, at a convenient distance from his house,
rich soil, with a gentle slope, and northern exposure, hut heavily tim-
bered. In such circumstances, he must go to the trouble and expense
of clearing the land, and probably this is by no means an easy work.
Our Australian timber is hard and heavy, and is generally useless
except for fuel. Clearing the land is done in either of these two
ways :—the one way is by digging deep and wide about the roots of
the tree, cutting them so that it may fall, and then burning the fallen
timber on the ground. This is beyond all comparison the more
expensive way, but it is also the more effectual way of clearing land.
The other way is to cut the trees at a convenient height—about two
or three feet —from the ground, then draw them together into heaps
and burn them. In this case the stumps are left standing for many
years; the field presenting the appearance of a grave-yard studded
with monuments. Girdling the trees, that is, cutting round and
removing a section of the bark, so as to kill them, is hut a very slow
process, and is now seldom adopted even by the squatter, whose tenure
of land is so precarious.
Many places are so densely timbered, and that timber is so hard
and so formidable in dimension, that to prepare a single acre for the
plough would be as much as any two men could accomplish in one
week. Persons who have not had colonial experience, are apt to
imagine that the timber itself would pay at least a part of the clearing.
The timber is of no value. It is almost uniformly uneven and rotten
within. In Sydney and some other large towns, where firewood is
scarce, and consequently dear, any sort of timber would readily find a
purchaser. But how to get it sent to Sydney is the question. It cannot
be conveyed in rafts, even supposing the settler’s land was contiguous
to some navigable river, or the sea-shore. Our Australian timber will
not float, its specific gravity being greater than that of water. This is
a serious loss to the colony. There is, however, one advantage
resulting from this peculiar character of our timber, viz., that not-
withstanding the carelessness and drunkenness of many of our
domestic servants, we seldom suffer any loss by fire. So hard is the
wood, that I have repeatedly kindled a fire and performed several
chemical experiments on the wooden floor of my study-room.
The durability of such dense wood is very great. This is a fortu-
nate circumstance; for around our cultivated fields we have neither

The durability of such dense wood is very great. This is a fortu-
nate circumstance; for around our cultivated fields we have neither


hedges nor stone walls, and the only barrier against the intrusion of
cattle is a fence entirely constructed of timber. A single tree may be
found, when split, sufficient to enclose an acre. You will be amazed
at the enormous dimensions of some of the trees in the Australian
forest. I have measured one which I found to be forty-five feet in
circumference four feet from the base. It is no uncommon thing to
see a tree forty feet in circumference, and one hundred feet high
without a branch. One of these trees would be more than sufficient
to build such a house as would accommodate a whole family. These
enormous giants of the forest give a majestic aspect to our rural
scenery. In Yan Diemen’s Land the timber is even still larger.
Mr. Robinson, the chief protector of the aborigines, states that he
had seen several trees in Tasmania, each of which was sixty feet in
circumference, and two hundred and fifty feet in height. These very
large trees are seldom of any practical use to the settler, who gene-
rally prefers, for fencing and building, trees measuring from two to
three feet in diameter. The timber commonly used here for fencing
is stringy bark, iron bark, or gum, and in some few cases pine and
forest oak. Our fences are constructed in the following manner :
Two, three, and sometimes, though rarely, four rails, each nine feet
long, are placed horizontally one above another, at short intervals,
with their ends inserted into mortised posts which stand perpendicu-
larly, being firmly fixed from eighteen inches to two feet in the
ground, and about five feet above it. Two or three hundred rails and
posts may be got from one tree. The posts are mortised with a tool
called a mortising axe ; no other tool is used for this purpose. Split
rails are preferred to round ones, and the wider they are the better;
as in this case the vacant space between the edges of every two of
them is of course diminished.
There are several men in this colony whose trade or only employ-
ment is to put up these fences. It has always been “ a money-mak-
ing job.” Even at the present reduced prices for all sorts of fences,
two industrious men can easily earn between them from 12s. to 15s.
a-day by fencing. This sort of work is paid for by the rod (five and
a half yards). The fencers have to go to the wood, cut the stuff,
mortise the posts, dig the holes in the ground for these posts, prepare
the ends of the rails, and then put up the fence. Their employer
always drives the stuff out of the wood, and places it along the line of
the intended fence. It will be seen from this description, that the
Australian differs very widely from either the London or the Parisian
system of fencing.

CHAPTER 111.
APPEARANCE OF AUSTRALIA.
Picture to yourselves, iu the midst of the ocean, surrounded
with precipitous rocks, and nearly opposite to England, a vast forest
diversified with mountains and valleys; innumerable plains without a
tree; rivers, some of them consisting only of a chain of ponds; others
of them, after running for hundreds of miles through extensive tracts
of fertile soil, rapidly disappearing in the midst of arid sand, while
others of them roll their majestic streams for a thousand miles, until
they mingle their waters with the ocean; here and there, like an
oasis in the wilderness, a solitary patch of cleared land, with a hut,
constructed of slabs and bark, in the rear; a tribe of naked blacks,
carrying their weapons of war, roaming across the distant plains;
large tracts of open forest-land, resembling a gentleman’s domain in
England, but occupied by only the kangaroo and the emu, which
seem to claim and enjoy hereditary possession; lofty ranges, covered
with the most beautiful verdure to their very summits; extensive
lagoons, darkened with legions of wild ducks and teal, the property of
any man who may choose to shoot them; innumerable birds of the
most beautiful plumage, chirping on every branch around you;
flowers of every hue and shade of colour strewing your path, wherever
you go; above you an Italian sky, without a cloud or speck, and the
air you inhale pure and balmy; a fearful silence pervading the forest
around you, and vividly impressing upon your mind the idea of soli-
tude and desolation —that is Australia.

to Australia, may successfully attempt to neutralize, or turn to ridi-

obliquity as the inhabitants ; and where, on looking amid the rural
scenes for the evergreen , you see only the never-green —that is
Australia.
Now it was by a species of ridicule, or parody, somewhat similar
to this, that James Thomson’s tragedy of Sophonisba, which cost its
author more labour, care, and anxiety, than his Seasons, was excluded
from a fair hearing; for no sooner had the actor uttered the line —
“Oh! Sophonisba, Sophonisba, oh!” than an impudent, unfeeling
wag, sitting in front of the upper gallery, shouted—“Oh! Jemmy
Thomson, Jemmy Thomson, oh!” an unexpected addition, which
threw the whole assembly into one simultaneous roar of laughter, put
an end to all farther acting for that evening, and condemned for ever
poor Jemmy Thomson’s tragedy of Sophonisba by converting it into a
comedy.
Anything, however, you can write may be thus ridiculed, by a man
who is fond of joking. The Bible excepted, I know of no writing
that would pass scatheless through this experimentum crucis.
But to proceed : Australia is the land of contrarieties. It is the
land of which it is extremely difficult to convey to a stranger an
adequate idea. Everything here is different from what it is with you.
We have summer when you have winter; we have day when you
have night; we have our longest day when you have your shortest
day; at noon we look north for the sun; we have our feet pressing
hard nearly opposite to your feet; —but these are not the only
respects in which we differ from you. Nature, out of sheer spite to
England, seems to have taken a delight in producing a complete dis-
similarity between us; take the following examples:—our swans are
black, our eagles are white, our valleys are cold, our mountain tops
are warm, our north winds are hot, our south winds arc cold, our east
winds are healthy, our cherries grow with the stone outside, our bees
are without any sting, our aborigines without any clothing, our birds
without music, many of our flowers without any smell, most of our
trees without shade, our population without any poor, our cuckoo
coos only in the night, while our owl screeches or hoots only in the


love of pelf, have destroyed all the fine feelings of human nature;
■where the inhabitants are day and night tormented with legions of
mosquitoes; where the crops have often failed through excessive
drought; where the navigable rivers are very few in number; where
the interior is, in most cases, badly watered; where a large propor-
tion of the soil is only a miserable scrub, scarcely yielding sustenance
for goats; where the timber is as hollow-hearted and as notorious for
obliquity as the inhabitants ; and where, on looking amid the rural
scenes for the evergreen , you see only the never-green —that is
Australia.

day-time, our moles lay eggs, and one of our birds (the Melliphaga)
has a broom in his mouth instead of a tongue. But to extend this
enumeration can be of no practical use to the intending emigrant. He
will see all that I have here stated, and a great deal more, before he is
any length of time in the colony. My object in this chapter is to
describe the general appearance of New South "Wales. There are
three great roads leading from Sydney into the remotest parts of the
interior. One of these main roads runs nearly due north, and parallel
with the shore of the Pacific, from Sydney, to the river Hawkesbury,
which is crossed by means of a punt; then the road winds through
gulleys and over ranges, along the valley of the Wollombi, into the
town of Maitland, on the river Hunter. This road was made by
government at an immense expense; but since the steamers have
begun to run regularly between Sydney and Maitland, the route over-
land has been altogether abandoned, and “ the great northern road,”
made at such immense expense, is now almost impassable. The
second great road leading from Sydney, runs nearly in a western
direction, goes through Paramatta, passes through the town of Penrith,
where the traveller crosses the Hawkesbury river by a large punt;
thence the road leads for many miles up, through a sandy, miserable
scrub, to the top of Mount York, which forms a part of an immense
range called the Blue Mountains, running from north to south, nearly
parallel with the coast, and at a distance of about sixty miles from it.
Viewed from the summit of Mount York, which is 4000 feet above
sea-level, the colony has a very imposing aspect. Here and there are
to be seen a few clear spots amidst an interminable forest. To the
east, at the distance of sixty miles, is the Pacific Ocean : in every
other direction is an endless variety of hill and dale, of deep gulleys,
inaccessible ravines, perpendicular rocks, and towering mountains
covered with trees, and green grass and flowers, to their very summits;
all displaying Nature in her wildest forms. I feel assured that if the
celebrated Alison and Burke had passed a day among these mountains
during one of our tremendous thunder-storms, the former would have
found some additional matter for his Essays on Taste , and the latter
would have added a new chapter to his work on the Sublime and Beau-
tiful. I once passed a night far away from any house, among the
mountains beyond Liverpool Plains, during one of the most awful
thunder-storms ever experienced in this colony. The repeated flashes
of lightning rendered darkness visible. The corruscations and lurid
glare made it appear as if the atmosphere was on fire. The air was
tainted with sulphuric smell; the loud and rapid peals of thunder,


day-time, our moles lay eggs, and one of our birds (the Melliphaga)
has a broom in his mouth instead of a tongue. But to extend this

of lightning rendered darkness visible. The corruscations and lurid
glare made it appear as if the atmosphere was on fire. The air was
tainted with sulphuric smell; the loud and rapid peals of thunder,


reverberated from mountain to mountain, seemed like the artillery of
heaven let loose to accomplish nature’s dissolution. I was surrounded
by a range of lofty mountains, every one of which seemed to “have
got a tongue.” This war among the elements was succeeded by tor-
rents of rain, to which I was completely exposed ; for, soon after the
thunder-storm had begun, I took the precaution of removing my bed
from under the trees, for fear of their attracting the lightning. Many
a tree was that night struck, and instantly shivered to atoms : I slept
none ; my horses, which stood near me, refused to feed. When day-
light appeared, extensive and fearful was the havoc effected by the
combined power of the lightning and whirlwind. Trees which hap-
pened to attract the electric fluid were completely stripped of their
bark, and split down the centre from top to bottom; while their
branches, some of which a ton weight, were rent from the main
trunk, and scattered in all directions, often to the distance of one
hundred yards. But I beg pardon, reader, for having left you so
long on the high-road at the top of Mount York.
From Mount York the road passes through the town of Hartley,
consisting only of a few scattered houses, situated in a beautiful
valley, called the Yale of Clywd. From this place to Bathurst
nothing of any interest is to be seen, except Sir Thomas Mitchell’s
splendid road, made at enormous expense, across mountains, through
rocks, and over gulleys: it was a magnificent undertaking. Bathurst
is situated in the midst of a large, open plain, 2000 feet above the
level of the sea, contains upwards of 60,000 acres without a tree, and
is nearly bisected'by the Macquarie Eiver, which runs through it
from east to west.
From Bathurst the road leads to Wellington Valley, which is also
on the Macquarie River. This valley is eminently beautiful; it con-
sists of a large plain, extremely fertile, surrounded by high hills.
Here are two missionaries labouring among the aborigines. Here is
the most distant post-office to the west in this colony.
The third and last great road is that which leads from Sydney to
Port Philip. On all this road, measuring upwards of six hundred
miles, there is little to be seen but gum-trees and public-houses. If
you have seen a mile of it, you have seen the whole road from Sydney
to Melbourne, the capital of Port Phillip. The only difference is ?
that as you recede from Sydney, the grass for your horse improves, in
the same ratio that the accommodation for yourself becomes worse. In
those towns, namely Liverpool, Campbelltown, Berrina, Goulburn,
and Yass, through which you must pass in the order in which I have

those towns, namely Liverpool, Campbelltown, Berrina, Goulburn,
and Yass, through which you must pass in the order in which I have


mentioned them, and in which post-offices are established, there is a
choice of accommodation; hut from the time you leave Yass, which is
about two hundred miles from Sydney, until you reach Melbourne, a
distance of four hundred miles, you are fairly in what is called the
hush. In short, you are beyond the region of civilisation. On this
journey of four hundred miles there is neither church, clergyman,
nor schoolmaster. The consequence is, what might be expected, that
a large proportion of the inhabitants are living like heathens. The
children of overseers and small squatters grow up in total ignorance of
their duty towards God and man. On one large establishment, be-
longing to Mr. B , the people had actually lost their reckoning in
the days of the week, so that they kept (they knew not how long)
Friday for Sunday. It is unnecessary for me to state, that the
children born in this district are, with very few exceptions, unbap-
tized. I know, however, of one case where a Mr. and Mrs. Huon
brought their infant daughter to Melbourne, a distance of two
hundred miles, to receive the rite of baptism. There being no public
or appropriated place of interment, the dead are buried anywhere,
generally on the side of a hill, near the hut once occupied by the
deceased. From Sydney to Port Phillip you have to cross four great
rivers. The first of these is the Murrimbidgee, 270 miles from Sydney;
at the crossing-place of this river is the government township of
Gundagai, a post-town.
The Hume River is 130 miles farther on, or 400 miles from Sydney.
At the crossing-place of the Hume is the thriving town of Albury, a
post-town. Situated as it is on the banks of a splendid river, on the
mail-road between Sidney and Port Phillip, in the very centre of a
rich pastoral district, and nearly equi-distant—2oo miles —from Yass
and Melbourne, Albury promises to be a place of great importance at
no very distant period. Among its inhabitants are two medical men,
four storekeepers, carpenters, blacksmiths, shoemakers, brickmakers,
carriers, policemen, &c. The river Ovens, at which there is a post-
office, is fifty miles beyond the Hume ; and the Goulburn River, at
which also there is a post-office, is ninety miles beyond the Ovens,
and within sixty-five miles of Melbourne. All these rivers abound
with fish. The four rivers crossed by the Sydney and Port Phillip
road, I have seen more than once overflow their banks. I have
known the Murrimbidgee to rise five feet in one night; it was after a
heavy rain, which melted the snow on the mountains. In October
last (1844), this river rose so high as to spread over a large extent of
the adjacent plains, and obliged several of the inhabitants of Gundagai

which also there is a post-office, is ninety miles beyond the Ovens,
and within sixty-five miles of Melbourne. All these rivers abound
with fish. The four rivers crossed by the Sydney and Port Phillip
road, I have seen more than once overflow their banks. I have
known the Murrimbidgee to rise five feet in one night; it was after a
heavy rain, which melted the snow on the mountains. In October
last (1844), this river rose so high as to spread over a large extent of
the adjacent plains, and obliged several of the inhabitants of Gundagai


to take refuge on the tops of their houses, until they were removed
from their perilous situation by black fellows in their canoes. At the
crossing-place of every one of these four rivers there is a good punt
for the public accommodation. From the Ovens to the Goulburn
River, a distance of ninety miles, the country is for the most part poor
and scrubby, and in summer the water is always scarce. As you
approach within forty miles of the town of Melbourne, the country
gradually opens, presenting extensive plains, naturally cleared, and
thickly covered with grass. The soil is evidently rich, and thousands
of acres may be found in one block, ready without any preparation for
the plough.
The land in the neighbourhood of Melbourne produces splendid
crops. For growing wheat, maize, and potatoes, the Port Phillip
district is unrivalled in Australia. I know two or three instances in
which the potato crops for one year paid the whole of the original
cost of the land, and also the expense of the cultivation. The appear-
ance and variety of the gardens in the vicinity of Melbourne,
prove the superior fertility of the soil and the genial character of the
climate.
The size and appearance of the town would surprise any newly-
arrived immigrant, who knows that the place which he now sees
covered with an extensive mass of fine buildings, and presenting such
a busy scene, was ten years ago a perfect wilderness. Melbourne,
which is beautifully situated in and on the sides of a valley, contains a
population of about 7000. It has several shops, which would do no
discredit to the most fashionable streets of the English metropolis.
The town is on and watered by the Yarra Yarra, where that river
flows into an inlet of Hobson’s Bay. The houses are chiefly built of
brick; the streets are wide, straight, and cut one another at right
angles. To me it was truly delightful to witness the appearance of
the town on a Sunday; the places of worship all well attended, the
people dressed in their best attire, the shops shut, the streets quiet as
in an English town, and no visible symptoms of riot or drunkenness.
This moral superiority of Melbourne over Sydney I can attribute to
nothing else than the comparative absence of convict influence; for,
including ticket-of-leave men, there are only about 600 convicts now
within the district of Port Phillip. The people of Melbourne have
committed one sad blunder in choosing for their burial ground a place
close to the town; so close, indeed, that it almost adjoins one of the
already half-finished streets. In my opinion, this is a thing which
ought to have been particularly guarded against in this warm climate.

Should the town continue to extend so rapidly as it has hitherto
done, this burial-ground will in a few years hence be situated in the
very heart of it. Once already have the people of Sydney been
obliged to remove their grave-yard, which was originally situated in
what is now the centre of the city; and there is every probability,
from our rapidly extending edifices, that a second removal of our
graveyard will become necessary at no very distant period.
The shipping is down opposite to what is called William’s Town,
which is nine miles below Melbourne. Only small crafts can come
up the river, and the goods to and from all large vessels are conveyed
by barges. This is a great obstacle to the prosperity of the place ; for,
not to speak of the additional expenses of this mode of conveyance,
the goods, owing to the carelessness of the men who work the barges,
are not unfrequently injured by salt water, &c. The town of Mel-
bourne is represented by one member, and the Port Phillip district
generally by five members, in our Botany Bay Parliament.

rewarded for my trouble with a smile of contempt, if I tell you that

mechanics’ school of arts, debating societies, commercial reading-
rooms, several booksellers’ shops, and last, though not least, our
editors and daily newspapers.

very amusing peculiarity. If you happen to advance any opinion, or
endeavour to establish any doctrine unpalatable to the editor, instead
of attempting to refute or disprove by argument your statements, he


immediately falls foul of yourself, abuses you personally, and if there
is anything objectionable in all your past history, he rakes it up, and
places it against your statements, —to prove, of course, that they are
incorrect.
It will be interesting to parents who intend emigrating to New
South Wales, to be informed that there is scarcely a town of any note
in the colony that cannot boast of its academy or school; and in
Sydney there are several highly respectable seminaries, conducted by
men of superior talents. There are also several ladies’ boarding-
schools, where day scholars are received. With the exception of law,
physic, and divinity, there is not a branch of a liberal education but
may be studied as successfully in Sydney as in any one of your British
institutions. Many important situations are now very creditably filled
by native youths, who never left the colony; and I believe that there is
not a government office, or bank in Sydney, in which there is not now
employed one or more ef those young gentlemen who attended my own
class when I taught in the Australian College. The Episcopalian
Bishop has ordained some young men who received the whole of their
education in this colony. Such a step as this has not yet, in any
instance, been taken by the Presbyterians, although they have, many
years ago, organised and established—chiefly through the exertions of
our great lion, Dr. Lang—a system of education in the Australian
College, far more comprehensive, and in every respect more calculated
to prepare for the duties of the Christian ministry, than any system
hitherto introduced under the auspices of our Episcopalians.
There is one great obstacle here to the progress of literature.
Money is so easily earned in this colony, that parents, instead of
educating their sons for the learned professions, or allowing them to
remain at school until they have received a liberal education, send
them to the bush with a few flocks of sheep, which is a surer and
much shorter way of arriving at colonial eminence and independence.
This conduct on the part of parents has always been, and still conti-
nues to be, a source of great annoyance to every zealous teacher in
New South Wales. It is much to be regretted that colonial youths
should not receive the benefits of a classical and philosophical educa-
tion, and thus have the chance of eventually distinguishing themselves
as literary characters. From my having, during the space of seven

is anything objectionable in all your past history, he rakes it up, and
places it against your statements, —to prove, of course, that they are
incorrect.
It will be interesting to parents who intend emigrating to New
South Wales, to be informed that there is scarcely a town of any note
in the colony that cannot boast of its academy or school; and in
Sydney there are several highly respectable seminaries, conducted by
men of superior talents. There are also several ladies’ boarding-
schools, where day scholars are received. With the exception of law,
physic, and divinity, there is not a branch of a liberal education but
may be studied as successfully in Sydney as in any one of your British
institutions. Many important situations are now very creditably filled
by native youths, who never left the colony; and I believe that there is
not a government office, or bank in Sydney, in which there is not now
employed one or more ef those young gentlemen who attended my own
class when I taught in the Australian College. The Episcopalian
Bishop has ordained some young men who received the whole of their
education in this colony. Such a step as this has not yet, in any
instance, been taken by the Presbyterians, although they have, many
years ago, organised and established—chiefly through the exertions of
our great lion, Dr. Lang—a system of education in the Australian
College, far more comprehensive, and in every respect more calculated
to prepare for the duties of the Christian ministry, than any system
hitherto introduced under the auspices of our Episcopalians.
There is one great obstacle here to the progress of literature.
Money is so easily earned in this colony, that parents, instead of
educating their sons for the learned professions, or allowing them to
remain at school until they have received a liberal education, send
them to the bush with a few flocks of sheep, which is a surer and
much shorter way of arriving at colonial eminence and independence.
This conduct on the part of parents has always been, and still conti-
nues to be, a source of great annoyance to every zealous teacher in
New South Wales. It is much to be regretted that colonial youths
should not receive the benefits of a classical and philosophical educa-
tion, and thus have the chance of eventually distinguishing themselves
as literary characters. From my having, during the space of seven
years, taught mathematics and natural philosophy to a public class of
them here, I may be allowed to express my opinion that, in point of
natural abilities and general aptitude to learn, they are not one whit
behind youths of the same age in England.


You will, no doubt, be greatly surprised when I inform you that
there is a general thirst for reading throughout Australia. I took
some pains to inquire into this fact; and the result of my inquiries has
been that there is an immense number of books of a certain class read
throughout the colony. Everybody reads. But lam sorry to add
that the reading chiefly in vogue is of a light and frivolous character.
There is not a bookseller or librarian here but will tell you that, while
celebrated works on divinity, history, and science, are allowed to
mould on their shelves, the demand for works of imagination is greater
than the supply. The Sydney Mechanics’ School of Arts, however,
has already done much, and promises to do a great deal more, in
checking this love of fiction, ond creating a desire after more rational
and intellectual enjoyment. This valuable institution numbered
some time ago no fewer than 800 among its members. Its library
contains by far the largest and most valuable collection of books in the
colony. The annual subscription is only 12s. a year, which entitles
the subscriber to attend all the lectures, and borrow from the library
any book which it may contain. The lectures hitherto delivered in
the institution have been gratuitous and voluntary, no paid lecturer
having been yet engaged by the committee of management, who have
repeatedly expressed their gratification at finding their wants in this
respect abundantly supplied by free-will offerings. Men of all classes,
of all religions, and of every shade of politics, are equalty zealous in
patronising the Mechanics’ School of Arts. In short, it is the only
really public institution in Sydney. We number among our lecturers
several of the most influential and talented men in the colony, such as
their Honours Justice A’Beckett and Justice Thcrry; Dr. Nicholson,
M.C. ; Dr. Wallace; R. Windeyer, Barrister and M.C.; Professor
Rennie; the Rev. Henry Carmichael, A,M. (author of an interesting
work on New South Wales), T. W. Cape, Esq., for many years head-
master of Sydney College; and several other literary gentlemen of
eminence and respectability. The course of lectures is very compre-
hensive, including, with the exception of politics and controversial
divinity, every subject on which it could benefit the mechanic to be
informed. That much interest is felt in these lectures, not only by
the mechanics for whose benefit they are chiefly provided, but by the
public in general, may be inferred from the large attendance of the
members, and the fact of reporters from the press being regularly sent
there, and a large portion of the newspapers’ columns being frequently
allotted to the publication of such reports. And this happened even

arts. I would recommend every emigrant who intends remaining in
Sydney or its vicinity, to become a member of this institution. The
expense is a mere trifle, and the benefit is invaluable. The facility
with which money may be accumulated in this colony, and the nume-

scientific pursuits to the sordid and debasing idea of pounds, shillings,
and pence; and I feel assured that to any man of cultivated mind,
newly arrived from England, the existence of a flourishing Mecha-
nics’ School of Arts in Botany Bay, numerously attended by all grades
of society, from the Governor down to the chimney-sweep, must
appear like an oasis in the wilderness —a solitary green spot, with its
refreshing streams, on which the eye of the weary traveller rests with
delight.

Having thus given you a peep at our Botany Bay literature, let
me now direct your attention to the state of our Colonial Churches.
You are no doubt aware that in this colony there is no Established
Church, or state religion. Perhaps I ought rather to havb said that there
are no fewer than three Established Churches or religions in New South
Wales; for there are three religious denominations that are equally
recognised and supported by the government. These denominations
are the Episcopalians, the Presbyterians, and the Roman Catholics.
Other denominations, such as Baptists, Independents, Methodists, and
Jews, have it in their power to claim and obtain pecuniary aid from
the government. The nature and extent of the aid which the govern-
ment affords, will be best seen from the following extracts from a
Church Act passed in the year 1836, in the time of Governor Sir
Richard Bourke.

CHURCHES AND CLERGYMEN. —MORALS AND SOCIETY.
Having thus given you a peep at our Botany Bay literature, let
me now direct your attention to the state of our Colonial Churches.
You are no doubt aware that in this colony there is no Established
Church, or state religion. Perhaps I ought rather to havb said that there
are no fewer than three Established Churches or religions in New South
Wales; for there are three religious denominations that are equally
recognised and supported by the government. These denominations
are the Episcopalians, the Presbyterians, and the Roman Catholics.
Other denominations, such as Baptists, Independents, Methodists, and
Jews, have it in their power to claim and obtain pecuniary aid from
the government. The nature and extent of the aid which the govern-
ment affords, will be best seen from the following extracts from a
Church Act passed in the year 1836, in the time of Governor Sir
Richard Bourke.
“ 1. That it is expedient and necessary, for the furtherance and
promotion of religion and good government, that the government


should should extend its countenance and support to the dispensation
of the ordinances of religion.
“ 2. That it is equally expedient and necessary that this counte-
nance and support should he extended in such a way as not to render
the ministers of religion independent of the Christian liberality and
respect of their people.
“ 3. That the exclusive establishment and endowment of any one
church, or body of professing Christians, in this colony, is equally
inexpedient and impracticable.
“4. That as there are at present three religious bodies, or churches,
already recognised and supported by the state, in this colony, viz., the
Episcopalians, the Eoman Catholics, and the Presbyterians, who con-
stitute the three most numerous and leading denominations in the
colony, it is expedient, &c., to extend the countenance and support of
the government to these churches, or religious bodies, indiscriminately;
leaving it in the power of the local government to extend that counte-
nance and support to other churches, or religious denominations, as
they shall see proper.
“5. That it is expedient that the countenance and support of
government should henceforth be extended to these churches, or reli-
gious bodies, in the following manner, viz., that in whatever place or
district in the colony, not less than £3OO shall be contributed by the
people for the erection of a church and manse for any one of these
denominations, an equal amount shall be paid from the colonial trea-
sury ; and that if one hundred adult persons shall subscribe a declara-
tion of their desire and intention to attend divine worship in the said
church, a salary of £lOO shall he paid by the government to the
minister; that if two hundred adult persons shall subscribe such a
declaration, a salary of £l5O shall be paid by the government; and
that if five hundred adult persons shall subscribe such a declaration, a
salary of £2OO (which shall henceforth he the maximum in all cases)
shall he contributed from the treasury.”
The act gives to the governor and executive council the discretion-
ary power of allowing £IOO a-year to'the minister of a population less
than one hundred, if, under the special circumstances of the case, they
shall deem it expedient so to do. The fifth section of the act provides
for the maintenance of ministers in places where no church or chapel
has been erected; the treasury allowance in such cases to be equivalent
to the sum raised by private contribution, hut not to exceed £IOO-
- the sixth section authorises the governor and executive council
to require, at least once a-year, some proof that each minister deriving


should should extend its countenance and support to the dispensation
of the ordinances of religion.
“ 2. That it is equally expedient and necessary that this counte-
nance and support should he extended in such a way as not to render
the ministers of religion independent of the Christian liberality and
respect of their people.

- the sixth section authorises the governor and executive council
to require, at least once a-year, some proof that each minister deriving


support from the treasury, has sufficiently and regularly performed his
duties.
The assistance from the treasury for the erection of churches and
dwelling-houses for the ministers, is to be given to an amount equal to
the subscriptions of the people, but is not to exceed £lOOO sterling in
any one case.
The passing of the Church Act, from which I have made the fore-
going quotations, has been followed by extremely beneficial results to
New South Wales. It has been the means of at least doubling the
number of clergymen belonging to the three religious denominations
already mentioned. Before the passing of this act, in the year 1836,
there were only five ordained Presbyterian clergymen in the colony,
viz., Lang, Macgarvie, Cleland, Smythe, and Garvcn. There are now
upwards of twenty ordained clergymen of the Church of Scotland
comfortably settled throughout the colony. The Episcopalian and
Roman Catholic clergymen have also increased in numbers in about the
same proportion as the Presbyterian. And still it may truly be said,
in reference to each of these three denominations of clergymen, “ and
yet there is room.” Several districts could be named which are desti-
tute of the public ordinances of religion, and where the people are both
able and willing to contribute towards the support of efficient ministers
of the gospel. The laxity of morals, and the prevalence of crime in
f.bis colony, are in a great measure to be attributed to deficiency of
religious instruction. Living far away from the house of God, and
beyond the limits to which the nearest clergyman can extend bis
visits, men who have been religiously brought up in their native land
gradually forget to practice those lessonsof piety which they were taught
in their youth. There being nothing around them to distinguish the
first day of the week from any of the rest, they cease'to “ remember
the Sabbath-day to keep it holy;” and this great bulwark of our
Christianity being broken down, they next walk in the counsel of the
ungodly, and then stand in the way of sinners, until at last they con-
tentedly sit down in the chair of the scornful. Between all these dif-
ferent steps of downward career the transition is easy and natural. I
am not here describing a hypothetical case. I have in several instances
been an eye-witness of it, during the last three years, on the Hume
River. There, in a populous district, we are two hundred miles from
the nearest church or clergyman. There is neither missionary, cate-
chist, nor schoolmaster in all this district. It cannot boast even of a
burial-ground; and hence the dead are generally buried in sight of
the huts. Their graves may be seen here and there in the forest,

chist, nor schoolmaster in all this district. It cannot boast even of a
burial-ground; and hence the dead are generally buried in sight of
the huts. Their graves may be seen here and there in the forest,


fenced in by a few rails. Owing to the total absence of all the means
of religious instruction, the people here can hardly be said to be
Christians. The Yery form of Christianity is lost among them. On
several establishments no distinction is made between Sabbath and
week-day. On one establishment in particular, which it would not be
prudent to publish, the people kept, they knew not how long, Friday
instead of Sabbath-day. In reply to a question from me, one man
stated, that from his having been for years accustomed to sbave him-
self every Saturday evening, he was still able in the bush to tell which
was Sunday by the exact length of his beard. To me this was quite a
novel mode of reckoning time. Several parents having children unbap-
tized here, came at different times to me with an urgent request that I
would baptize their children (some of whom were six or seven years of
age), as the distance, two hundred miles, to either Yass or Melbourne,
the residence of the nearest clergyman of any denomination, was such
a journey as, in the imperfect state of the roads, they were unable to
accomplish. And for precisely the same reason there are several people
living in a state of concubinage beyond the boundaries of location.
The continuance, if not the existence of such a state of things in a
British colony, must surely be unknown to the missionary societies at
home. In hopes that these few remarks may meet the eye of some
member who feels an interest in the promulgation of the gospel in
foreign parts, I will add that here is a wide and promising field for
missionary exertions. All that is required is a fit and proper clergy-
man to itinerate among us. He has no foreign language to acquire, as
among the heathens. His labours would be confined to his own coun-
trymen. All the qualifications requisite for the right performance of
the task may, in my opinion, be summed up in a few words—prudence,
unconquerable zeal, fervent piety, and at least a moderate share of
natural and acquired abilities. He ought also to be a good rider,
capable of enduring fatigue, and able occasionally to sleep out under a
tree and dine even on a piece of half-roasted opossum at a black
fellow’s camp. If he could swim it would be a useful accomplishment.
The hospitality of the people her is proverbial, and any traveller who
has even the slightest appearance of being respectable, is received and
gratuitously accommodated by the squatter with every mark of atten-
tion and kindness. I shall, perhaps, be asked, If the religious deficiency
is so great in this district, why do the settlers not liberally subscribe,
and then as a body memorialize the committee of the General Assem-
bly, or some missionary society, to send out to them at their own (the
colonists’) expense, a suitable person to supply this deficiency ? The

answer to such a question is simply this : that it has uniformly been
found that the desire for religious instruction is exactly in the inverse
ratio to the need of it; and that admitting the facts which I have
above stated, the only inference which can be deduced from the silence
of the people on this subject is, that they have sunk into a state of
total indifference. If no minister is sent to them until they apply for
one, I fear that the time will never come. Life must be put into the
dead body before there is any desire either felt or expressed for
nourishment.
In the remote western district of the colony, towards Wellington
Valley and Mudgee, the Eev. Colin Stewart, an ordained clergyman
of the Church of Scotland, has been for the last few years itinerating
among the scattered settlers or bushmen with indefatigable persever-
ance and considerable success.
The Episcopalians, from being five times as numerous, and pro-
bably five times as wealthy as the Presbyterians in the Colony, have
been able to secure the services of a larger number of clergymen,
whom they have spread over a larger extent of territory. But even
they have hitherto found it inconvenient to spare a clergyman to
itinerate among the far distant bushmen.
The following is a list of most of those colonial towns and places
at each of which a Presbyterian clergyman is settled: —Port Macquarie,
Newcastle, Maitland, William’s Eiver, Patrick’s Plains, Bathurst,
Hartley, Windsor, Portland Head, Parramatta, Campbelltown, Goul-
burn, Braidwood, Woollongong, and Melbourne.
In Sidney there are three Presbyterian churches, five Episcopalian,
three Eoman Catholic, one Wesleyan, one Baptist, one Independent,
one Australian Methodist, one Bethel Union, one “ Friends’ Society
House,” and one Jewish Synagogue; or, in all, eighteen places of
public worship, which, excepting the last named (the Synagogue), are
open every Sabbath. It is much to be regretted, however, that a
large number of the inhabitants seldom enter a church-door. In
Sydney, Sabbath desecration is a crying evil. The day is spent by
many in boating, driving, riding, drinking, visiting, &c. Most of the
churches are more than half empty.
Several clergymen of the three leading denominations, Episcopa-
lians, Presbyterians, and Eoman Catholics, have each of them two or
three different preaching stations, widely apart from one another,
which they visit at stated periods. This is going to work the right
way : it is removing the general excuse of distance, and forcing the
great truths of the Gospel upon the notice of the people. This is

no other way of reaching many of the settlers throughout this
colony.

Botany Bay. But I have no wish that any of you should come here,
neither have I the least inducement to conceal from you any of our
moral deformities ; and I must then candidly tell you that our calen-
dar of crime is truly frightful, embracing murder, highway robbery,
stabbing, arson, cutting and maiming, burglary, shooting and wound-
ing, rape, piracy, perjury, cattle-stealing, &c. In one year no fewer
than 116 sentences of capital convictions had been passed for crimes
of violence alone ; for you are no doubt aware that, since 1833, capi-
tal punishment for what were considered minor offences, such as
forgery, theft, &c., ceased to be awarded.
If you were only to peep into the Sydney police office on a Monday
forenoon, you would there see a lovely specimen of our morality.
Scores of men, women, boys, and girls, who had been dragged off the
streets on the preceding evening for drunkenness, fighting, and other
similar offences, standing with brazen faces to hear their respective
sentences. You may then, every two or three minutes, hear thundered
forth with the voice of authority from the magistrates’ bench, “ Six
hours to the stocks —ten days to the cells —twenty days to the tread-
mill—fifty lashes (on his bare back)! ”
Among the motley group of culprits thus convicted of drunkenness,
riot, theft, &c., you see smart-looking girls of fourteen or fifteen years
of age; elderly and young women, dressed in silk gowns and Leghorn
bonnets, broken noses, or no noses at all, and black eyes. Ido not
mean eyes naturally black, but only artificially blackened by the kind
husband through sheer affection—a pair of artificially black eyes being
the Botany Bay coat of arms. I need not tell you that the great
domestic amusement here is that famous game called u playing at cross
purposes a spirited sort of bodily exercise, which I believe is not
altogether unknown in some families in England.
In the vicinity of Sydney, and on all the principal roads in the
interior of the colony, bushrangers are frequently committing depre-
dations. They are generally well armed and mounted, and go in
bodies of from two or three to half-a-dozen. Their main object being
plunder, they seldom commit murder unless they are resisted in their
attempts at the commission of robbery. Within the last few weeks
they have two or three times stopped and robbed our mail-coaches


doubtless a toilsome undertaking for the clergyman; but there is
no other way of reaching many of the settlers throughout this
colony.
If I had any selfish interest in advising you to emigrate to Austra-
lia, I would not say a single syllable about the morals or society of
Botany Bay. But I have no wish that any of you should come here,

dations. They are generally well armed and mounted, and go in

plunder, they seldom commit murder unless they are resisted in their
attempts at the commission of robbery. Within the last few weeks
they have two or three times stopped and robbed our mail-coaches


loaded with passengers. I almost forgot to tell you, that with very
few exceptions, these bushrangers are convicts who have run away
from their masters, or broken away from government iron-gangs, and
taken themselves to the hush (the woods) to procure a livelihood by
robbery. A large majority of them are Irish Roman Catholics.
Throughout the interior, and even in Sydney, they find numerous
receivers for their stolen and robbed property. These receivers not
only harbour them, but provide them from time to time with supplies
of ammunition, food, and clothing, and inform them when valuable
stores are about leaving Sydney, and by what roads; also, what
gentlemen are supposed to keep money in their houses, and how such
gentlemen could be most easily robbed. In May last, a worthy
friend of my own, a Mr. James Noble, was thus murdered by three
bushrangers (convicts) in his own house, in the heart of Sydney, on a
Sunday evening, as he was reading his Bible, the leaves of which were
found stained with his blood. Mr. Noble was a commission-agent,
and believed to keep money in his house.
The two prevailing vices here are drunkenness and avarice.
These are our besetting sins. From these two sources proceed almost
all the crimes which stain the annals of the colony. That drunken-
ness is common, you may reasonably infer from the enormous sum of
money paid as duty here on imported and colonially-distilled spirits.
In the year 1836, the consumers were 62,925 in number, and yet the
direct revenue from ardent spirits amounted in that year to £127,000,
showing that every male and female throughout the colony, above
twelve years of age, paid in direct taxation, for ardent spirits alone,
more than £2. Any man who is addicted to the free use of intoxicat-
ing liquors, has overstepped the barrier which the dictates of reason
and the obligations of religion have interposed between- him and the
commission of crime; drunkenness obliterates the line of demarcation
between good and evil; and the drunkard, having thus wilfully
resigned the guidance of his reason, is ready, when temptation offers,
to purchase the indulgence of his passions at whatever hazard, either
to his body or soul. As some of the offsprings and concomitants of
drunkenness, cursing and swearing, ribaldry and blasphemy, annoy
the ear wherever you go. Temperance societies and total abstinence
societies are here supported by large numbers of consistent members ;
but the great majority of these members have never been drunkards,
and they joined those societies for no other purpose than to set a good
example. The great body of drunkards, young and old, still cling to
their vicious habits; the moral leprosy is perpetuated, filling our


loaded with passengers. I almost forgot to tell you, that with very

country with crime, our gaols with inmates, and our grave-yards wuth
food for the worm.
But avarice, that “ auri sacra fames” is neither less common, nor
in its results less detrimental to the interests of morality and religion,
than is drunkenness. Money, money, money. Nothing is considered
disgraceful here but the want of money. It covers an immense mul-
titude of sins. Acts of swindling, if cleverly done, do not here, as in
England, exclude a man from society, and brand him with infamy ; it
is only poverty that excludes even one brother from the house of a
richer brother in Botany Bay. In this colony it is
“ Cash makes the man, and want of it the fellow,
The rest is all but leather and prunello.”
In order to convince you that I am not dealing in general assertions
unsupported by facts, in stating that swindling, cleverly committed,
does not here exclude a rich man from what is called high life, I will
copy at random two or three authentic anecdotes, from a collection of
some scores which I some time ago gathered, as illustrative of Botany
Bay morals. About six years ago, Mr. , who is a Sydney mer-
chant and bank director, attended a land sale of town allotments, on
the Parramatta road, at a place called Burwood, within six or seven
miles of Sydney, when he entered an adjoining public-house, kept by
a man named C , to whom Mr. stated that he came up for
the purpose of buying some allotments, which were situated contigu-
ous to C ’s property, on which C requested him, as a particu-
lar favour, not to do so, as he himself intended to buy them, and that
he could hardly do withont them. It was ultimately agreed that the
bank director should receive £5O for not opposing C at the sale.
A cheque for this sum was drawn out and given to the director. The
sale proceeded. The allotments in question were bought, not by the
director, who stood looking on, but by a person in his employment,
for they were marked down in the auctioneer’s hook in Mr. ’s
name. The publican was furious, took his horse and galloped to
Sydney to stop the payment of the cheque at the bank: but Mr. ’s
horse was the better goer of the two. It was after bank hours before
either of them arrived; yet Mr. ’s influence as a bank director
having readily secured him a hearing, he received and pocketed the
£5O before the thick-winded publican could obtain an audience.
A few years ago, a respectable settler, living with his family on
his own purchased farm of upwards of two thousand acres, on the
Hunter’s River, mortgaged his land to Mr. B of Sydney, for
about £BOO, to enable him to purchase live stock, which was then


country with crime, our gaols with inmates, and our grave-yards wuth
food for the worm.

A few years ago, a respectable settler, living with his family on
his own purchased farm of upwards of two thousand acres, on the
Hunter’s River, mortgaged his land to Mr. B of Sydney, for
about £BOO, to enable him to purchase live stock, which was then


selling at a very high price. In consequence of the price of live stock
falling soon afterwards, and his land yielding him nothing, he was
unable, not only to pay off the mortgage, but even the interest. Mr.
B , the mortgagee, advertised the estate for sale. The settler had
been ill and confined to his house ; yet, on seeing his house and lands
advertised for sale, he contrived to come to Sydney. He was too late.
The sale was over. A Mr. , a Sydney merchant and bank direc-
tor (not the Burwood-town-allotment gentleman above referred to),
attended the sale in the settler’s name, and addressed the people
assembled in the auctioneer’s room in nearly the following terms; —
“You are perhaps aware that the property which is now about to be
here offered for sale belongs to a most worthy and industrious settler,
an old acquaintance and friend of my own, who has a numerous small
family depending upon him for their support. This is his only pro-
perty,—his house and home. If he loses it he is thrown destitute on
the world. My object in attending here this day is, if possible, to buy
in the estate for this worthy family.”
This short speech was effectual. It appealed to the best feelings
of our nature ; and I am certain, that if you had only seen the long-
faced solemn-looking director, you would not for a moment have
doubted his sincerity. The estate was put up for sale at only the
amount of burdens, about £IOOO, upon it. There was no bidder.
The bank director offered the up-set price. The estate was knocked
down to him. The deeds were made over to him, and immediately
afterwards he sold the same estate for about £2500, pocketed the
money, and laughed both at the settler and at the people whom he had
so cleverly duped in the auctioneer’s room. The settler, whom I
knew intimately, called on me a few days after the sale, when he told
me the above particulars. This affair seemed to ha've broken his
heart. As he had no money, the lawyers would do nothing for him.
Were the law of libel what it ought to be, I would here give in full
the names of the two bank directors who figure in the foregoing anec-
dotes ; but Lord Tenterden has long ago decided, that the more true
the statements are which affect private individuals, the greater is the
libel.
Within the last few months, a large stockholder in the Murrum-
bidgee district having visited his station there, found, apparently in a
dying state, one of his servants, who had been at one time a convict,
but who had by industry and economy become possessed of a little
property, partly in money and partly in horses. He requested his
master to write a will for him, conveying his property to his only


selling at a very high price. In consequence of the price of live stock
falling soon afterwards, and his land yielding him nothing, he was
unable, not only to pay off the mortgage, but even the interest. Mr.
B , the mortgagee, advertised the estate for sale. The settler had

bidgee district having visited his station there, found, apparently in a
dying state, one of his servants, who had been at one time a convict,
but who had by industry and economy become possessed of a little
property, partly in money and partly in horses. He requested his
master to write a will for him, conveying his property to his only


surviving brother in Ireland. On the following day, the master,
accompanied by two men who were to act as witnesses, came with the
will into the sick man’s bedroom, to procure his signature, which he
was earnestly pressed to put to it immediately. But the sick man,
suspecting that there was something wrong, alleged that he was then
too much indisposed to sit up to sign his name, hut that if the paper
was left with him, he would sign it next morning. After some hesi-
tation, the master left it. The man got it read to him. It was a
regularly drawn-up will, making over all his property to the master
himself! The invalid, who was then hardly able to crawl, immedi-
ately left the place. I have known him for years, and always
considered him a steady hard-working man. It was in February last,
a few months after leaving his old master, that the above particulars
were given to me by the man himself, when he showed me the will,
written in his master’s own hand ! Yes, written in the hand of that
villain who has cattle upon a thousand hills, and who derives a princely
income from his land and houses, flocks and herds. The curse of
Heaven must sooner or later alight upon such ill-gotten pelf. Nathan’s
parable to David is here more than realized.
This unbounded spirit of avarice frequently leads to perjury. The
following is an example:—A tailor in Sydney summoned a gentleman
for a suit of clothes before the commissioner of the court of requests.
The gentleman, never having had any dealings whatever with the
tailor, was quite surprised on receiving the summons. He called on a
lawyer, and explained to him the circumstances. The lawyer told
him to give himself no trouble about the matter, and promised that he
would manage it for him. On the appointed day the case came on ;
the tailor duly swore that he sold and delivered the clothes to the
gentleman; but to the great surprise of the gentleman, who now con-
cluded that the ease was decided against him, the lawyer called a
witness who swore that he was present, and saw the gentleman pay
to the tailor the full amount of the clothes.
I have reason to believe that in some cases immoral acts in this
colony proceed more from ignorance than from any preconcerted
design. A remarkable instance of this kind was related to me by the
Eev. Mr. H . In 1840, a decent-looking couple, after the usual
proclamation in his church, came to him to be married. It was after-
wards, however, discovered that the bridegroom had heen, through
some accident, detained at home, and that it was his brother who
arrived, accompanied by the bride and two or three of her friends.
They waited a whole hour for the bridegroom, hut never told the


surviving brother in Ireland. On the following day, the master,
accompanied by two men who were to act as witnesses, came with the
will into the sick man’s bedroom, to procure his signature, which he
was earnestly pressed to put to it immediately. But the sick man,

wards, however, discovered that the bridegroom had heen, through
some accident, detained at home, and that it was his brother who
arrived, accompanied by the bride and two or three of her friends.
They waited a whole hour for the bridegroom, hut never told the


clergyman the real cause of their waiting. At last they stated they
would wait no longer. My friend accordingly married them, and they
returned home. "When this irreparable blunder was afterwards dis-
covered, the married brother, in the simplicity of his heart, stated that
he thought he could transfer the young wife in the evening to his
brother, the real bridegroom, for whom he waited a whole hour, and
that he “ was unwilling to return home from the parson, after having
come so far, without doing some business by way of securing the
woman.” I forgot to inquire of my friend, the Rev. Mr. H , with
which of the two brothers the blooming bride has since lived—
whether it was with her real or with her intended husband.
This is, I think, the greatest extension of “ a power of attorney ”
that I have ever known given in this colony.
It would not be fair to conclude these remarks without mention-
ing the fact, that the state of morals in New South Wales has been
greatly improved within the last few years. This salutary change
has been produced by a variety of causes, such as the large numbers
of reputable emigrants that have arrived here within these few years.
The combined efforts of an increased number of clergymen and school-
masters have greatly tended to neutralize convict influence, and
reduce these black sheep to their degraded level.
Another great cause of the improved morals here is to be found in
the altered character of the colonial press. Convict editors, as for-
merly, are now nowhere employed to preach to her Majesty’s lieges
their moral and religious duties. And the press has a very great in-
fluence on the colonial public; everybody here is able to pay for a
newspaper, and is moreover anxious to hear the news of the times.
The convicts—that curse of this fair colony—are now rapidly dimin-
ishing in number and influence. Their day is gone'; and an act of
the British Parliament has been passed to prevent any more of the
sweepings of English, Irish, and Scotch jails being sent to New South
Wales to pollute our moral atmosphere, and render the finest country
in the world a perfect Pandemonium.
The different benches of magistrates are now much more chary
than they used to be in granting licenses for public-houses. Many
improper persons, who once kept public-houses, have been latterly
refused the renewal of their licenses; and every publican whose house
is improperly conducted is liable to have his license cancelled. This
regulation has been productive of happy effects to the colony. At one
time the most direct road to fortune was by selling ardent spirits.
Immense fortunes were thus realised by very questionable characters

Immense fortunes were thus realised by very questionable characters


in a few years ; but then a public-house was nothing better than a
den of thieves. Houses and land, and herds of cattle, were made over
to the publican for rum by the besotted settler.
Those gentlemen in England who feel any interest in the prospe-
rity of the Australian colonies, ought to exert themselves in endea-
vouring to stop the usual allowance of ardent spirits to those emigrants
whose passage is paid by the government. The issuing of spirits as
part of their rations on ship-board during so long a voyage, has, in
many instances, been the means of first creating a desire, and then of
gradually establishing a habit, which rendered the emigrants a dis-
grace and a nuisance to the colony. It is painful to witness groups
of emigrants, soon after their arrival, staggering along the streets of
Sydney in a state of intoxication.
The great disproportion of the sexes is another obstacle to the
moral improvement of this colony. This is a serious evil in the eye
of the philosopher and the philanthropist, and is such as requires for
its removal the interposition of the British government. It is to be
hoped, that in the selection of emigrants who shall receive a free pas-
sage to Australia, no unmarried man above the age of eighteen shall
be deemed eligible.*
CHAPTER VI.
LAND AND SQUATTING REGULATIONS.

in a few years ; but then a public-house was nothing better than a
den of thieves. Houses and land, and herds of cattle, were made over
to the publican for rum by the besotted settler.
Those gentlemen in England who feel any interest in the prospe-
rity of the Australian colonies, ought to exert themselves in endea-
vouring to stop the usual allowance of ardent spirits to those emigrants
whose passage is paid by the government. The issuing of spirits as
part of their rations on ship-board during so long a voyage, has, in
many instances, been the means of first creating a desire, and then of
gradually establishing a habit, which rendered the emigrants a dis-
grace and a nuisance to the colony. It is painful to witness groups
of emigrants, soon after their arrival, staggering along the streets of
Sydney in a state of intoxication.
The great disproportion of the sexes is another obstacle to the
moral improvement of this colony. This is a serious evil in the eye
of the philosopher and the philanthropist, and is such as requires for
its removal the interposition of the British government. It is to be
hoped, that in the selection of emigrants who shall receive a free pas-
sage to Australia, no unmarried man above the age of eighteen shall
be deemed eligible.*

LAND AND SQUATTING REGULATIONS.
The total quantity of lands alienated up to last year, within the
nineteen counties into which New South Wales is divided, is nearly

ral. For the first seven years after the abolition of grants, the crown
lands were offered for sale by public auction at a minimum price of
ss. per acre. The minimum price was afterwards, that is, about
seven years ago, raised by the Home Government to 12s. per acre, and
three years ago to 20s. per acre; for, in the year 1842, an Act of the
British Parliament passed for the purpose of establishing a fixed mini-
mum price of land in the Australian colonies of 20s. per acre. Very
little land has been bought here from the government since the pro-
mulgation of this Act of 1842. The following official statement will
show the large revenue which had been derived during the five years
ending 1840, from the sale of crown lands within this colony :

The emigrant who intends to purchase land here, applies at the
Surveyor-General’s office, where he inspects the maps of the colony,
and sees what lands are unappropriated. He then visits and person-
ally examines various localities which he thinks would suit him.
Having made his selection, he applies for it to the government,
which, after one month’s notice in the case of emigrants newly arrived,
and after three month’s notice in all other cases, will put up to sale,
by public auction, at a minimum price of 20s. per acre, the lands so
applied for, if approved of by the Governor, whose approval, however,
is always given as a matter of course.
If the selection is made so as to encroach on a rich neighbour, the
emigrant may be opposed at the sale, and obliged either to pay too
much for his land, or witness an unexpected rival become the pur-
chaser of it. It may also happen that through some unforeseen cir-
cumstance the measurement of the land applied for is either not com-
pleted, or not reported previous to the day of sale, in which case the
sale is delayed.
“ With the exception of special cases, the reasons of which must
be assigned, each lot so put up for sale will consist of not less than
one square mile, or 640 acres. If a section with water frontage does
not contain this full quantity, the section behind it will be added to

the lot. The highest bidder must pay down a deposit of ten per cent,
at the time of sale, and the remainder of the purchase-money within
one month, under penalty of forfeiting both the land and deposit.”
Instead of buying land from the government, the emigrant might
save himself much time and trouble, by buying from private indi-
viduals a small farm, partially cleared, with house and other improve-
ments on it, at a less sum than the government minimum price. I
have known several small farms of this description, which have been
sold within the last few months at less than 10s. an acre.
A few days ago a farm of 2000 (two thousand) acres of excellent
land, well watered, all fenced in, a great part of it under cultivation,
with a large and substantial dwelling-house, an orchard, garden,
stables, men’s huts, and barn, which cpst £2OO, were all offered for
£BOO (eight hundred). It is situated in a beautiful valley, near the
town of Berrima, eighty-five miles from Sydney, on the mail road to
Port Phillip. In May, 1843, a farm belonging to Mr. Ward Stephens,
on the River Hunter, measuring 1200 acres, and partially improved,
was sold at Is. 3d. per acre, or £75 for the whole of this farm of
twelve hundred acres! There are many such opportunities which
the emigrant, with a small capital, may have of suiting himself with-
out either losing time and money by the delay, or running the risk of
competition arising from his attempting to buy land from govern-
ment.
Some emigrants prefer leasing for a certain number of years farms
already cleared. This has frequently been done by families who
wished to gain colonial experience before making any purchase in
land, or who preferred to lay out the greater part of their capital in
live stock or some other investment. Farms of all descriptions and
of any extent may be obtained on lease of from two or three to ten or
twelve years. Yet the preferable way is to buy the farm, how small
soever it may he in extent. A man has never the same inducement
to exert himself when he knows that all his improvements will, after
the lapse of a few years, pass into the hands of his landlord, who will
turn him and his family adrift to begin the world anew.
Whatever quantity of land a man cultivates, let it be absolutely
his own, and then he will in good spirits and in right earnest begin
to improve what he knows is to descend to his children’s children.
To induce any newly-arrived emigrant to take a farm on a clearing
lease here is downright cruelty. Many a poor fellow has thus been
robbed of his little capital, his time, and his labour, in clearing the
heavily-timbered estates of our rich landed proprietors. Whatever,

therefore, you do after landing in Australia, avoid taking a farm on a
clearing lease, no matter what may be the soil, the situation, the
duration of the lease, or other plausible inducements held out to you
by the man of acres.
Now, supposing that either you have no money or no inclination
to buy land, whether cleared or uncleared, and that you are equally
disinclined to lease a farm, or, in short, to have anything at all to do
with farming, and yet that you are desirous to become the owner
of sheep and cattle, how are you to obtain pasture for them, and
a home for yourself ? The answer to your question is,—become
a squatter, like more than one half of all the rich and respectable
stockholders in the colony. More than one half of all the present
members of the Legislative Council are squatters, and, agreeably to
the confession of the Lord Chancellor, Iler Majesty Queen Victoria
herself is but a squatter in Australia; and surely it cannot be wrong
to follow the example of such an amiable lady.
Therefore, without adducing any further arguments, I shall now
take it for granted, as a thing admitted, if not fully proved, that to
squat is common, is right, is fashionable. Then comes the other
question, what it is to squat ? and what you may, or can, or might,
could, would, or should do, in order that you may or can squat. All
that you have to do is, first, to accompany beyond the limits of loca-
tion some friend or acquaintance who knows the district where you
wish to have your station. Push beyond the farthest out-stations,
making all possible search and inquiry as you proceed, and, as a means
of further securing the object of your excursion, stipulate to give a
trifle to some stockman connected with one of the farthest out-stations,
on condition that he shall accompany you and endeavour to find for
you a suitable place for your flocks and herds. The requisites are the
following;—A reasonable distance, say seven or eight miles, from
your nearest neighbour, either plains or open forest land, plenty of
good grass, and, above all, plenty of water in the dryest season, lim-
ber for building and fencing can be got conveniently anywhere, except
at Maneroo, and one or two other places.
Immediately after you have selected your run, write to the Com-
missioner of Crown Lands for the district, applying for what is called
a depasturing license. In your application to the Commissioner you
describe as nearly as you can the boundaries of your run, and the
extent or number of square miles you claim. If the Commissioner
has reason to believe that you are a reputable person, and worthy of
holding a squatting license, this application will secure your run

against any other squatter for six months, so as to allow you time to
build your hut and bring your live stock on the ground. Your ap-
plication is forwarded by the Commissioner, with his approval, to the
Colonial Treasurer, Sydney, or Sub-Colonial Treasurer, Melbourne,
according to the district in which your selection is made, and you will
be required to pay at the Treasury the sum of £lO sterling fora
squatting license, which entitles you to occupy your station and run
for one year, providing your license is taken out in July, for all
squatting licenses expire on the 30th of June yearly, and must be
renewed thereafter by the payment of £lO.
Besides the £lO for a depasturing license, the squatter must also
pay to the government the following half-yearly assessment on all the
sheep, cattle, and horses which he may have on his station: —for
every sheep one half-penny, for cattle three halfpence each, and for
horses three pence each.
Hitherto one license has been held sufficient to entitle the squatter
to occupy any reasonable number of stations of any extent in the same
district, but the Governor has last year proposed to make every station
pay a separate license, and to allow no station to include more than
20 (twenty) square miles, unless a double license, or £2O, be paid
yearly for it. The colonists have furiously opposed this proposed law,
which, therefore, has not been yet enforced.
There is no doubt, however, that the present squatting regulations
require to he revised and modified. Many abuses which I could
specify have been gradually introduced. I know of a whole family, who
occupy some hundreds of square miles, for which they pay only one
license, or £lO, besides the usual assessment.

At the formation of the colony in the year 1788, fifty-seven years
ago, the live stock consisted of 4 cows, 1 bull, 1 bull-calf, 3 mares, 3
colts, and 1 stallion. No sheep. Twenty-two years afterwards, or
in the year 1810, on the arrival of Governor Macquarie, the live stock
of the colony was found to be—of cattle, 12,442; sheep, 25,888;

hogs, 9544 ; horses, 1134 ; and in the month of October, in the year
1821, immediately before Governor Macquarie’s departure from the


colony, the live stock was—of cattle, 102,939 ; sheep, 290,158 ; hogs,
33,906; horses, 4564.
For the introduction of fine-woolled sheep, the colony has been
indebted to the late John Macarthur, Esq , whose flocks, in the year
1803, amounted to nearly 4000, derived chiefly from thirty Indian
sheep purchased in the year 1793, from a ship which arrived in Syd-
ney from Calcutta. To these thirty sheep Mr. Macarthur had added
ten of the pure Spanish Merino breed. This is the origin of our
grand staple commodity, which required last year from Sydney alone
forty ships for its transport to London, amounting in weight to
10,000,000 lbs., and realising in Sydney the large sum of £625,000 —
a pretty income from one article alone from so young a colony.
Pigs are easily fed here where milk, peaches, maize, &c., are so
plentiful. You scarcely pass a station or hut without seeing a lot of
pigs, either running about or in a sty at a short distance. I have
seen herds of two hundred of them together feeding out in the woods
and followed by the swineherd. They were of all sizes, of all ages,
and of all sorts of breed. They got very little to eat, except what
they picked up in the bush.
Many parts of this country are extremely well adapted for the
rearing and maintenance of goats, and for no other purpose. In the
year 1832, a Mr. Eiley imported to this colony a few Cashmere goats
from France. In three years the number increased to three hundred.
About that time Mr. Eiley exported three of them to the Cape of
Good Hope,—one pure male, and one female, and one cross-bred
female, produced from our common goat and the Cashmere. These
three sold at the Cape for £l5O. Last year I saw a fine flock of these
goats near Sydney, at a farm called Canterbury, belonging to a Mr.
Campbell, a Sydney merchant, and lately a member pf the Legislative
Council.
There is one great advantage attending goats, viz., they are liable
to no disease of any consequence. They are also more hardy and
more easily fed than sheep. Several of our great colonial stockholders
occupy runs inclu ling many thousands of acres, which are useless for
either sheep, cattle, or horses, hut which would well answer for feed-
ing numerous herds of the common goats; and I have not the slightest
doubt that these would yield a liberal profit to the grazier. They
require but little care. They would travel to market with greater
ease and expedition than any sheep. They increase very rapidly, in
most cases producing twins: and now that boiling-down establish-
ments are formed extensively throughout the colony, the male increase,

most cases producing twins: and now that boiling-down establish-
ments are formed extensively throughout the colony, the male increase,


when full grown, might be yearly boiled down for their tallow. The
skin is thrice as valuable as that of a sheep, and it is a well-known
fact that goats’ tallow always commands a higher price than either
sheep or bullocks’ tallow. In hardness and purity candles made from
goats’ tallow differ but little from those of sperm or wax.
According to an official report made by the Colonial Secretary,
and published by the Legislative Council, the live stock in the colony
of New South Wales, on the 30th of September, 1843, was as follows:
56,585 horses, 897,219 homed cattle, 4,804,846 sheep, 46,086 pigs.
Of these there were then in the Sydney or Middle District, 40,184
horses, 304,886 horned cattle, 1,596,417 sheep, 43,045 pigs; in the
Southern or Port Phillip District, 1349 horses, 19,419 horned cattle,
185,322 sheep, 3141 pigs; and in the Commissioners’ Districts with-
out the limits of location, 15,052 horses, 572,914 horned cattle,
3,023,107 sheep. Pigs pay no assessment, the number is therefore
unknown to the government.
The enormous number of horses, now upwards of 70,000, we have
here for so small a population, will, no doubt, surprise you; and you
will naturally ask—for what purpose do you rear such an immense
number of animals, which neither carry fleeces for the woollen manu-
facturer, nor flesh for the butcher ? In reply I must inform you,
that a very large number of horses is required and annually ruined in
performing our ordinary work in this colony.
Everything here is done on horseback —every man you meet is on
horseback. In the interior a boy will not travel from the hut to the
stockyard except on horseback. A man will walk two miles to catch
a horse to carry him one mile. A black fellow will not proceed fifty
paces for you unless you lend him a horse to ride. So well known
and established is this rule, that at some stations a dozen saddle-
horses are always kept for the work of the place. Every stockman
who looks after your cattle expects two or three horses to be appro-
priated entirely to his own use while in your employment. Almost
every respectable clerk and shopkeeper in Sydney, and in every other
town throughout the colony, has his high-bred horse, on which he
cuts all sorts of capers and vagaries as often as he can slip away from
his desk or counter. Every shoemaker and every tailor does the same
—the son of Crispin throws away his last, and the Vulgar Fraction
his goose, to mount his horse. I have seen fiddlers and dancing-
masters frequently ride their high-spirited chargers and drive their
tandems. Every man who wishes to move out of Sydney buys a
horse. Nothing can be seen or done without a horse. In India there


when full grown, might be yearly boiled down for their tallow. The
skin is thrice as valuable as that of a sheep, and it is a well-known
fact that goats’ tallow always commands a higher price than either
sheep or bullocks’ tallow. In hardness and purity candles made from
goats’ tallow differ but little from those of sperm or wax.
According to an official report made by the Colonial Secretary,
and published by the Legislative Council, the live stock in the colony
of New South Wales, on the 30th of September, 1843, was as follows:
56,585 horses, 897,219 homed cattle, 4,804,846 sheep, 46,086 pigs.
Of these there were then in the Sydney or Middle District, 40,184
horses, 304,886 horned cattle, 1,596,417 sheep, 43,045 pigs; in the
Southern or Port Phillip District, 1349 horses, 19,419 horned cattle,
185,322 sheep, 3141 pigs; and in the Commissioners’ Districts with-
out the limits of location, 15,052 horses, 572,914 horned cattle,
3,023,107 sheep. Pigs pay no assessment, the number is therefore
unknown to the government.
The enormous number of horses, now upwards of 70,000, we have
here for so small a population, will, no doubt, surprise you; and you
will naturally ask—for what purpose do you rear such an immense
number of animals, which neither carry fleeces for the woollen manu-
facturer, nor flesh for the butcher ? In reply I must inform you,
that a very large number of horses is required and annually ruined in
performing our ordinary work in this colony.
Everything here is done on horseback —every man you meet is on
horseback. In the interior a boy will not travel from the hut to the
stockyard except on horseback. A man will walk two miles to catch
a horse to carry him one mile. A black fellow will not proceed fifty
paces for you unless you lend him a horse to ride. So well known
and established is this rule, that at some stations a dozen saddle-
horses are always kept for the work of the place. Every stockman
who looks after your cattle expects two or three horses to be appro-
priated entirely to his own use while in your employment. Almost
every respectable clerk and shopkeeper in Sydney, and in every other
town throughout the colony, has his high-bred horse, on which he
cuts all sorts of capers and vagaries as often as he can slip away from
his desk or counter. Every shoemaker and every tailor does the same
—the son of Crispin throws away his last, and the Vulgar Fraction
his goose, to mount his horse. I have seen fiddlers and dancing-
masters frequently ride their high-spirited chargers and drive their
tandems. Every man who wishes to move out of Sydney buys a
horse. Nothing can be seen or done without a horse. In India there


is now a great demand for our horses. Ship-loads of them have already
been sent thither, which have sold remarkably well, averaging £BO
each; the expense of freight, fodder, &c., is only about £2O. And
there are now in the colony three agents from India selecting and
buying horses for the East India Company’s service.
Already has New Zealand been partly supplied by us with horses;
and that rising colony must come to us as the nearest market for fur-
ther supplies of horses. Every new colony that may be formed on
any part of this great continental island, or within two or three
thousand miles of it, must be supplied by us with horses. Every new
station which may be formed, either within or beyond the prescribed
boundaries of the colony, necessarily absorbs a certain number of our
surplus horses. Every respectable settler that arrives among us buys
a horse. The land adjacent to the main roads within many miles of
Sydney, being now fenced in from the public, horses are beginning
to be used instead of bullocks for the conveyance of goods to and from
our metropolis; and wherever expedition is required in the carriage
of supplies to stations, goods to country stores and other places, or in
sending agricultural or dairy produce to market, horses, which travel
so much faster than bullocks, arc now employed. Carriers generally
employ horse-teams. In ploughing also bullocks are now, in several
instances, superseded by horses, which not only do the work quicker,
but save the expense of a man, for in ploughing with a team of bul-
locks two men are required, one to drive them and the other to hold
the plough; whereas the man who ploughs with horses can also drive
them, or rather guide them by means of his reins. In the absence of
railroads, canals, and navigable rivers, horses will always be in
demand. If a poor man wishes to remove his family, he must buy a
horse. The servant often prefers a horse to moncy-in payment of his
wages. The bond-man frequently saves his few shillings, received as
indulgences for good conduct, in order that when he becomes free he
may buy a horse to carry him. Rich and poor, young and old, male
and female, bond and free, all equally “ put their trust in horses.”
"Without horses we should all be as fixed and stationary in one place
as the oysters which cling to and cover the rocks of Port Jackson.
So general is the demand for horses here, not as a speculation, but as
a means, and the only means of locomotion, that, from one end of
New South Wales to the other, nothing is heard but one reiterated,
urgent, and loud ejaculation—'“ a horse, a horse, my kingdom for a
horse! ”

I know of no station formed exclusively for horses. They are


generally kept on the cattle station; and the stockman who looks after
the cattle is also expected to attend to the horses. The chief stock of
our colonial horses are derived from some blood horses from India,
afterward improved by numerous and well-selected importations from
England. In general our colonial horses are well bred and suited for
the saddle, for gigs, and light carriages ; but we have very few of the
real draught horses. It is no uncommon thing to see butchers, bakers,
and publicans ride nearly thorough-bred horses. We have several
very superior English, and also a few pure Arab stallions, whose pro-
geny is very beautiful. Yet it is to be regretted that the attention of
breeders has hitherto been chiefly confined to the rearing of horses
of a lighter make, or approaching to the racing cut, since of late
horse-teams have begun to supersede bullock-teams, and, as a conse-
quence, cart-horses are now greatly in demand.
The colonial horses are remarkable for their toughness and capa-
city of enduring fatigue and hunger. The climate is very favourable
to them. English horses would perhaps stand the same hardships
here ; but our horses, I am convinced, could not endure it in England.
It is the climate that makes all the difference. I have often
ridden the same horse fifty and sometimes sixty miles without a
bite of food of any kind: and I repeatedly rode the same horse a
journey of 400 miles in ten days, during which time he ate nothing
except the wild grass he picked up at night while I was sleeping at
the root of a tree.
It is rare in this colony to see an aged horse. This is owing
partly to our horses being broken-in and wrought when too young,
generally under three years of age, often not exceeding two, and
partly to the cruel usage they receive, for often are they ridden fifty
or sixty miles a-day without a morsel of food, and then at their jour-
ney’s end, instead of being well groomed and fed, as in England, the
unfeeling rider takes the saddle off him, gives him a kick, and sends
him smoking hot, all hot (as the pieman would say), adrift to pick
up what he can get in the hush until he is wanted next morning.
About six years ago several ship-loads of horses were imported
into this colony from Valparaiso, South America. In general they
were ugly animals, and all very imperfectly broken-in; but the cross
produced between them and our colonial horses has proved extremely
hardy and sufficiently tractable. We have also had several ship-loads
of ponies from Timor, an island a little to the north of New Holland.
They are a miserable set of puny creatures, seldom exceeding ten or
eleven hands high, big-headed, low-shouldered, rough-legged, bad-

tempered, unbroken, and, when broken, only fit to carry school-boys;
yet such was at one time the mania for these miserable things in the
shape of horses, that in 1840 I have witnessed, at a public sale in
Sydney, a Timor mare, just imported along with one hundred and
fifty others, sold for forty guineas, cash!
From the year 1837 to 1842, inclusive, 2913 horses, chiefly from
South America and from the island of Timor, were imported into this
colony.
We have a few mules and asses here, which are found to answer
the climate and rough character of the country very well; but owing
to their slow movements they are of no use after stock.
When a settler wants an additional horse at his station, he accom-
panies his stockman out on the run, and drives into the stockyard a
mob of horses, which had never been under the roof of a house, and
never been handled. One of these is now roped by throwing a run-
ning noose over his head on his neck. He pulls—the men hold fast
the other end of the rope, until he is half choked and falls. They
hold down his head, slacken the noose, put on him the breaking-in
tackle, and lunge himnext day lunge him again, saddle him, mount
him, and gallop away on him. He is now considered broken-in to
saddle. But the fact is, that few, if any, of our saddle horses are
properly broken-in; and yet it is truly astonishing to witness the
feats of horsemanship performed by our stockmen on these scarcely
half-broken-in quadrupeds: up hill, down hill, zig-zag, sharp turns,
over creeks, rocks, logs, and bushes, full gallop after a wild bul-
lock. I have often witnessed a fox-hunt when living in England, but
it was nothing—absolutely nothing, compared to our fear-nought,
break-neck, hurry-skurry, Australian tally-ho. Old men and young
women, and hoys of seven or eight years of age,* are fearless and
accomplished riders. In England the huntsman has only to look out
for and be ready to clear hedges, fences, and ditches; but here we
have often across our path not only a dense forest, but every other
sort of obstacle which the vagaries of nature could scatter through
space. It does occasionally happen that shoulder-blades are dislo-
cated —arms, legs, and heads broken, collar-bones put out, and ex-
hausted horses drop down dead —but it is truly surprising how few
accidents happen to so many mad-caps; for not only is there the
chance of your falling from your horse, or of both you and him falling
together, or of his running you against a branch of a tree, but the
bullocks you are chasing often turn about and charge you. It is then

All our horses are branded with the owner’s brand (generally his
initials) impressed on the horse’s skin with red-hot iron. With-
out having some such indelible mark upon our horses, they could
neither be identified nor sworn to by the owner, in case they may
have gone astray or be stolen, and therefore the law here requires that
all horses and homed cattle above twelve months old shall have on
them some distinguishing brand. At all cattle and horse stations,
therefore, the owner or his overseer superintends the branding of all
the yearly increase of live stock.

SHEEP.
In the official return of live stock made up in the Colonial Secre-
tary’s Office in December 1843, it is stated, as mentioned in a former
chapter, that the number of sheep in the colony of New South Wales
on the 30th Sept. 1843, was 4,804,846, or nearly five millions; but }
this was eighteen months ago, and it must be borne in mind that as
unweaned lambs are exempted from the government assessment of one
penny per head per annum, they, at least , were excluded from the
above return, which was made out just at the dropping of the crop of
spring lambs. Now, after making due allowance for the probable
number of deaths from old age, disease, and other causes, also for the
number since boiled down for their tallow, and those slaughtered for
rations or sold to the butchers, our present stock of sheep of all ages
cannot be less than 6,500,000, or six-and-a-half millions.
From the year 1837 to 1842, inclusive, no fewer than 103,723
sheep were imported into New South Wales. They were principally
imported from Yan Diemen’s Land to the district of Port Phillip.
As wool is not only our grand staple article, but the only commo-
dity whence, in my opinion* the colonists can expect to derive a steady
and permanent income, I will here give a few scattered hints, embody-
ing the result of my own experience during the last ten years as a
sheepholder, for the guidance of those emigrants who may wish to
invest part of their capital in the purchase of sheep.

ing the result of my own experience during the last ten years as a
sheepholder, for the guidance of those emigrants who may wish to
invest part of their capital in the purchase of sheep.
The first advice I would give you is, to buy none but young ewes.


Old ewes, or culls , as they are called, can. seldom rear lambs ; and, if
they do, the progeny is never so strong and healthy as that of a young
ewe. In winter again, especially if very wet, you will be daily
annoyed by seeing your old ewes dying in half dozens.
The proper number of breeding ewes for each flock is from 500 to
700, according to the nature and quality of the run. If your run is
open forest land, and the feed is good, the latter number (700) may
safely be put in one flock; if, on the contrary, the run is scrubby,
thickly timbered, or poor soil, or swampy ground, 600 breeding ewes
in a flock are sufficient. Whatever may be the nature or quality of
the run, to keep a smaller number than 500 in a flock will not pay the
proprietor, while wool and mutton continue at the present low prices,
as the expense of shepherding, watching, &c., is the same, whatever
may be the numerical strength of the flock; and, on the other hand,
to keep a larger number than 700 or 800 ewes in one flock would be
running headlong into Charybdis in attempting to avoid Scylla. So
large a number being in one flock would render it necessary for them
to spread widely and travel far for their food, and thus increase the
chances of some of them being lost or scattered, and devoured by
native dogs—an animal in every way resembling the English fox. I
have now upwards of 900 breeding ewes in one flock, but it is by far
too many to be running together.
No more than two flocks ought to be kept at each station : conse-
quently the complement of men necessary for each station is three,
being two shepherds and one watchman. The watchman acts as hut-
keeper by day, and is responsible for the safe keeping of both flocks of
sheep by night. The daily duty of each shepherd ends about sun-set,
when he either counts his flock over to the watchman, or, as is most
commonly the case, drives his sheep without counting into the hurdles.
From the time that they are driven into the hurdles until after break-
fast next morning, the sheep are under the care of the watchman, who
sleeps in a wooden box placed near the folds, so as to prevent the
attacks of native dogs, &c. It is also the duty of the watchman to
shift daily the hurdles, or to keep the fold well swept, if the sheep are
kept in yards; but I would advise the grazier to use hurdles only.
Dirty yards are the prolific source of disease ; and, however convenient
they may be to an indolent hut-keeper, the sheep-proprietor should
allow none of them to stand on his run while he can buy, beg, or
borrow hurdles. Hurdles can now be bought at £5 per 100. About
48 hurdles, that is, 12 square, are sufficient for a flock of 800 breeding
ewes. The sheepholder should see that his hut-keeper shifts, that is,

48 hurdles, that is, 12 square, are sufficient for a flock of 800 breeding
ewes. The sheepholder should see that his hut-keeper shifts, that is,


removes to a new place daily, these hurdles, especially if the weather
is wet or the ground soft. Each shepherd is allowed to have one dog,
and the watchman also requires a dog; he may he allowed to keep
two, but no more. Some of the largest stockholders in the colony
allow none of their shepherds to keep a dog. It has been found that
some shepherds leave their flocks entirely to the management of their
dogs ; and that, unless the dog is very well trained, the flock thus left
is generally in a low condition. No doubt, it would he a great advan-
tage to flock-owners if men could be found to undertake the shepherd-
ing of our flocks without employing any dog; at all events, you should
allow no more than one dog to be kept by each shepherd, and one or
two by each watchman. A few years ago there was scarcely a sheep
station throughout (he colony at which there was not kept a whole
regiment of curs, of high and low degree. The shepherds made a
trade of rearing them, for the purpose of selling them to newly-arrived
emigrants and others. In order to provide food for these dogs, the
shepherd or watchman practised a genuine piece of Botany Bay
villany. The method by which he had for years, without detection,
regularly provided mutton for his dogs at his master’s expense, was
very ingenious. If he broke the sheep’s leg, or otherwise visibly
injured the animal, its lameness would prevent it from travelling with
the flock, and it would probably he killed by order of the overseer or
master, who would cut up the carcase among the dogs; hut then the
shepherd, unless he could satisfactorily account for the accident,
would he either fined in his purse, if free, or punished in his person,
if bond. The problem was, how to occasion the death of the sheep
without leaving any external or internal mark of ill-treatment on it.
To do this the shepherd cut a pellet of wool, which, with a stick,
he rammed down the gullet of some good fat sheep so tightly that the
poor animal was very soon choked, and found dead. The overseer or
master examined the carcase externally and internally, but could dis-
cover no appearance of any improper treatment; the carcase, after
this coroner’s inquest was over, was cut up and divided among the
dogs. This was a regular system of Burking for years, until at last
one of these villains, who had a hand in it, became king’s evidence.
The distance that should intervene between every two stations on the
same run will greatly depend on the nature of the ground, the quality
and quantity of the feed, &c.; in general, the distance is between seven
and eight miles. This will allow the sheep from each station to travel
upwards of three miles in a direct line from each station, without the
chance of meeting or mixing with one another; and the run is very

and the watchman also requires a dog; he may he allowed to keep
two, but no more. Some of the largest stockholders in the colony
allow none of their shepherds to keep a dog. It has been found that
some shepherds leave their flocks entirely to the management of their
dogs ; and that, unless the dog is very well trained, the flock thus left
is generally in a low condition. No doubt, it would he a great advan-
tage to flock-owners if men could be found to undertake the shepherd-
ing of our flocks without employing any dog; at all events, you should
allow no more than one dog to be kept by each shepherd, and one or
two by each watchman. A few years ago there was scarcely a sheep
station throughout (he colony at which there was not kept a whole
regiment of curs, of high and low degree. The shepherds made a
trade of rearing them, for the purpose of selling them to newly-arrived
emigrants and others. In order to provide food for these dogs, the
shepherd or watchman practised a genuine piece of Botany Bay
villany. The method by which he had for years, without detection,
regularly provided mutton for his dogs at his master’s expense, was
very ingenious. If he broke the sheep’s leg, or otherwise visibly
injured the animal, its lameness would prevent it from travelling with
the flock, and it would probably he killed by order of the overseer or
master, who would cut up the carcase among the dogs; hut then the
shepherd, unless he could satisfactorily account for the accident,
would he either fined in his purse, if free, or punished in his person,
if bond. The problem was, how to occasion the death of the sheep
without leaving any external or internal mark of ill-treatment on it.
To do this the shepherd cut a pellet of wool, which, with a stick,
he rammed down the gullet of some good fat sheep so tightly that the
poor animal was very soon choked, and found dead. The overseer or
master examined the carcase externally and internally, but could dis-
cover no appearance of any improper treatment; the carcase, after
this coroner’s inquest was over, was cut up and divided among the
dogs. This was a regular system of Burking for years, until at last
one of these villains, who had a hand in it, became king’s evidence.
The distance that should intervene between every two stations on the
same run will greatly depend on the nature of the ground, the quality
and quantity of the feed, &c.; in general, the distance is between seven
and eight miles. This will allow the sheep from each station to travel
upwards of three miles in a direct line from each station, without the
chance of meeting or mixing with one another; and the run is very


bad indeed, if two flocks of about 700 each cannot collect sufficient
food within the area of a square measuring 36 square miles. By those
settlers who have expressed the most unfavourable opinion of the
capability of our pasture for grazing purposes, three acres have been
allowed as the fair average for the support of one sheep; and you
know that there are 640 acres in a square mile, the grass on which
ought, according to this calculation, to support 213 sheep.
No prudent flockmaster will allow his ewes to rear more than one
crop of lambs a-year. To have two lambings from the same flock in
the same year greatly injures the constitution of the ewes, and the
lambs themselves are generally puny and sickly. But these are not
the only evils resulting from this practice, which was, at one time,
very common: the fleece is not nearly so heavy from a ewe which
has been kept the greater part of the year rearing lambs, and, as a
matter of course, in low condition. There are two lambing seasons
in Australia; the one in March and April, the other in September
and October. The most experienced sheep proprietors prefer the
September and October lambing, and fully two-thirds of our lambs
are dropped at this season of the year. The weather is then becoming
daily warmer for the young lambs ; whereas April is often too cold,
and the grass is withered, which prevents the ewes from yielding so
much milk for the sustenance of the lambs. There is, however, this
advantage from the April lambs —that they carry a pretty good fleece
in November or December, the months in which sheep are shorn here.
Immediately before the ewes commence lambing, rock salt should be
given to them; otherwise many of them will eat the tails, ears, and
perhaps legs off the lambs, so fond are they of any substance to which
saline particles adhere.
The number of rams for each flock of 700 ewes, is from 10 to 12 ;
they are left in the flock about six weeks. You are aware that a ewe
runs twenty weeks. If, therefore, you wish that your lambing should
commence the last week in September, when the soft spring grass
covers the face of nature, you will, of course, put the rams among the
ewes on the first day of May; but if you prefer the April lambing,
you put the rams among the ewe flocks in November. The young
ewes, when eighteen months old, may be put to the rams ; the ewe
will thus be about two years when rearing her first lamb.
The rams, when taken from the ewes, are kept during the rest
of the year among a flock of wethers, which are generally running at
a separate station from the breeding flocks. The number of sheep in
a wether flock may be considerably larger than that in a ewe flock;

The rams, when taken from the ewes, are kept during the rest

a separate station from the breeding flocks. The number of sheep in
a wether flock may be considerably larger than that in a ewe flock;


wethers, being stronger, can travel faster and farther for their food.
It is common here to see 1000 wethers in one flock. Last year I had
upwards of 1400 in one flock ; hut it was too many, though my run
consists of very open forest land.
The most busy time with the shepherd is the lambing season. His
difficulty and labour are greatly increased by many of the ewes aban-
doning their lambs, which must again and again he put to the mothers
until they “ take to each other.” To secure this end, a great number
of small and separate enclosures are formed by means of hurdles.
Three hurdles, forming an equilateral triangle, are erected, and into
each of these triangles, or separate enclosures, a ewe with her rejected
lamb is put. To induce the ewe to take to her lamb, some salt, of
which all sheep are fond, is rubbed on the lamb’s skin, which the
mother now licks, first from her love for the salt, and ultimately from
her love to her offspring. In order to induce the shepherd to feel an
interest in the lambing, and to exert himself on this occasion, many
flockmasters allow a premium to those shepherds who rear the greatest
number of lambs for every hundred ewes in the flock. Without such
an inducement few shepherds would lose a night’s sleep for the sake
of saving a score of lambs. From 80 to 90 lambs reared from every
hundred ewes in the flock is considered “ good lambing.” Some sheep
proprietors have had 100 per cent., that is, a lamb for every ewe,
reared. The greatest per centage I have ever had from my ewes was
92 per cent.
A ewe that has lost her own lamb will allow a strange lamb to
suck her. In this way we relieve a owe that has twins , without kill-
ing either of them. Very few, however, of our ewes have twins, and
still fewer are able to rear them properly. Valuable lambs, whose
mothers have either died or have had twins, may bo fed on cow’s
milk by a quill inserted through a cork in a bottle. With this view
a couple of milch cows should be kept at every sheep station. During
the lambing season, which generally continues for a month or six
weeks, not only is the hut-keeper expected to assist the shepherd, but
an additional man is also employed for six weeks to look after such
lambs as are either too weak or too young to travel any distance from
the hurdles.
The lambs are weaned when they are five or six months old. If
the ewes are poor, the lambs may be weaned when they are about four
months old. When there are several lambing flocks, all the male
lambs of two or three flocks may be put together to form one
wether lamb flock, and all the female lambs of the same two or


wethers, being stronger, can travel faster and farther for their food.

proprietor is short of hands, and finds it inconvenient to increase
either the number of his shepherds or the number of his huts and
hurdles, and yet the lambs must be weaned. In this case all the lambs
of one flock may be put with the ewes of the other flock, vice versd.
Then the ewes of neither flock will allow the new lambs to suck
them.
Throughout the greater part of the colony, the month of November
is the shearing time. The sheep are first carefully washed in a lagoon,
or stream, in preference to a river, the water of which is either too
cold or too hard. To wash them, they are thrown into what is called
soaking-pens, made in water four or five feet deep. After remaining
a few minutes swimming about in these pens, they are taken one by
one by a row of men placed in the water, who all rub them in succes-
sion, until the master or overseer, who superintends this operation,
pronounces the sheep clean by singing out “ pass on.” There are
generally eight or nine men in the water, all up to their middle. The
regular task is to wash one flock a day. I generally got the blacks to
perform this work, and paid them with a few figs of tobacco and their
victuals, according to our previous agreement. In my opinion, much
labour and time might be saved, either by throwing into the pond in
which the sheep are to be washed a quantity of the ashes of our
Australian apple-tree,—as the alkali which these ashes contain would
greatly soften the water, —or by driving each flock swimming through
the pond on the day previous to washing them.
After washing, the sheep are left three or four days to dry, and
also to allow sufficient time for the “ yoke ” (the grease from the body
of the animal) to rise, and thus add weight and softness to the wool.
During this interval, they are kept from feeding or lying down upon
such ground as might again impart any extraneous matter to the
fleece. It is necessary that sheep should be shorn previous to the
grass seeds and burs becoming ripe, otherwise the wool will most
probably be deteriorated to the amount of two or three pence per
pound.
Shearing is commonly done in large sheds, which cover the
shearers both from rain and the heat of the sun. A man who is at all
expert at this sort of work can shear about 60 sheep a-day, for which
he is paid at the rate of from two to three shillings per score, with
board and lodging. I had one man who shore 100 daily, and I was
then paying four shillings a score with board, &c. One man is em-

then paying four shillings a score with board, &c. One man is em-


ployed in gathering the fleeces as they are shorn —another in folding
them up, and handing them to a man who is pressing them into a
large bag, called a wool-pack, capable of containing, under ordinary
pressure, about 2501b5. of wool, or about 100 average fleeces. This
wool pack is put empty into a strong square box, made of wood, in
which a man is employed in tramping and beating with feet, pole, or
spade, each fleece as it is put into the pack. When no more wool
can be pressed into it, the mouth of the pack is sewed up with some
strong twine. When filled, these packs are called bales. The pro-
prietor’s brand is now put on them, and they are generally numbered.
Of these bales, averaging in weight about 2501b5., one of our
ordinary wool-drays, drawn by eight bullocks, will carry to Sydney
from fifteen to twenty, or, according to the present prices of wool
(about Is. 3d. per 1b.,), to the value of from £240 to £3OO.
The drays and bullocks which carry the wool to Sydney or Mel-
bourne generally carry back supplies, such as tea, sugar, salt, soap,
tobacco, slops, &c., sufficient for the men at the stations until next
shearing season.
The wool-grower, so far from finding any difficulty in meeting
with a purchaser on the arrival of his wool in Sydney or Melbourne,
has often the pleasure of witnessing a scramble among the merchants
here as to which of them the first offer or the preference as a buyer
ought to be given.
Some people prefer selling their wool in the grease, that is, un-
washed, in which state it generally sells at half the price given for the
same wool when well washed: but in this case the fleece weighs
double what it weighs after being washed ; so that the profits are the
same. The objections, however, are, first, that one half of your load
on a journey of perhaps 400 miles is dirt, of which a few days’ sheep-
washing would have relieved you; and, secondly, that your sheep,
whose skins have, since last year’s washing, contracted a considerable
quantity of dust and sand, which irritate and often prevent the
animal from feeding, would have been greatly benefited by a thorough
ablution.
The usual weekly rations or provisions allowed to each shepherd
are as follow :—lO lbs. beef or mutton; 10 lbs. flour, or 1 peck of
wheat; 2 lbs. sugar; \ lb. tea, with some salt.
In addition to these weekly rations I allow each of my shepherds
the use of a milch cow. There is no sheep-station at which they may
not have a garden well stocked with vegetables, and most hut-keepers
have poultry.

From this you see that our Australian shepherds are better fed
than most of the labourers of Great Britain and Ireland. But in my
opinion the great advantage which the Australian shepherd enjoys
over the English labourer, is the superior opportunity of profitably
investing the savings of his yearly wages. I know many shepherds
who are stockholders to a small extent. The usual wages at present
to a shepherd is from £l6 to £22. These are much below the usual
wages ; this reduction has been occasioned by the recently depressed
state of the colony. Wages, however, are now rising with the rapidly
improving state of things here; and I have no doubt we shall soon
again have to give from £25 to £35 a year to every shepherd or hut-
keeper. Our climate is so delicious that very little clothing is re-
quired, and, therefore, the greater part of the man’s wages is clear
gain, which he may either hoard up or lay out in the purchase of
brood mares or cows, which his employer generally allows to graze,
without expense, among his own cattle.
As some masters are in the habit of supplying their servants with
slops (clothing of every sort) at fifty and sometimes one hundred per
cent, profit, I would suggest to shepherds, hut-keepers, stockmen, and
labourers, that they should stipulate with their employer, at the time
of their engagement, that his drays are to bring for them, free of
expense, any little article, such as shoes, trousers, shirts, &c., which
they might require, and for which they should be charged only the
Sydney prices.
To masters, I would suggest the expediency of so engaging their
shepherds, hut-keepers or labourers, that the expiry of their engage-
ment should not happen either at lambing or shearing time; and I
would farther suggest, that the engagements of not more than two or
three of the men should terminate simultaneously, otherwise the
master may be placed entirely at the mercy of his servants, who
know well their own importance, and, at busy periods of the year,
such as lambing, shearing, and reaping time, when men are scarce,
will so combine as to oblige their employer to yield to any demands,
how extravagant soever, which they may choose to make. In the
event of the master himself not residing at his stations, he will pro-
bably receive numerous complaints from his men against his overseer,
whom they will accuse of gross mismanagement, &c. Such com-
plaints, however, are, in nine cases out of ten, perfectly groundless.

Your success, however, as a flock-owner, will very much depend
on your personally attending to the management of your sheep. There
is nothing like the eye of the master. It is true everywhere, hut
more especially in Botany Bay, that “he who hy the plough would
thrive, himself must either hold or drive.” See that your sheep are
driven out to feed early enough in the morning—that they are driven
sufficiently far from the hut—that the shepherd does not “ dog them”
too much —that he does not keep them at what is here called “ a lick-
ing place,” that is, earth mixed with saline particles, which the sheep
would, if allowed, continue to eat all day, and thus allow the lazy
shepherd to sit down in one place from morning to evening. See that
your sheep are not driven home before sunset, that the hurdles are
daily shifted, that there is always the full complement of hurdles kept
in each fold, that the fold is never pitched in places where there
happen to he ant-hills, hlack-stumps, or overhanging trees, and that
the sheep are properly regulated. What is here called regulating the
sheep is done in the following manner : —being all mustered, those of
the same age are separated from the rest, and the males and females
are classified separately. All the old ewes and crawlers are put into
a flock hy themselves, and given in charge to a careful shepherd, with
instructions to feed them near the hut, so that they may not be far-
ther weakened by having to travel far for their food. Under the term
crawlers are included the lame, and those which are very poor, sickly,
or cranky. Old ewes and crawlers fall off in condition, chiefly because
they cannot keep up with the young and strong sheep, which eat up
every blade of grass before the crawlers moving in the rear arrive.
Old ewes, if kept from breeding, will soon fatten, and ought then to
he sold to the butcher. We generally sell our wethers when they are
three years old. The mutton however is better, if they are not killed
until they arrive at the age of four, and the wool will pay the ex-
pense of keep; hut after four the fleece becomes lighter. The average
weight of our wethers is about 60 lbs. the four quarters", of ewes the
average is less. I have seen some wethers which averaged 80 lbs.;
but for one flock of this description, we have twenty which would
average less than 60 lbs. after being driven to Sydney or Melbourne.

would, if allowed, continue to eat all day, and thus allow the lazy
shepherd to sit down in one place from morning to evening. See that
your sheep are not driven home before sunset, that the hurdles are
daily shifted, that there is always the full complement of hurdles kept
in each fold, that the fold is never pitched in places where there
happen to he ant-hills, hlack-stumps, or overhanging trees, and that
the sheep are properly regulated. What is here called regulating the
sheep is done in the following manner : —being all mustered, those of
the same age are separated from the rest, and the males and females
are classified separately. All the old ewes and crawlers are put into
a flock hy themselves, and given in charge to a careful shepherd, with
instructions to feed them near the hut, so that they may not be far-
ther weakened by having to travel far for their food. Under the term
crawlers are included the lame, and those which are very poor, sickly,
or cranky. Old ewes and crawlers fall off in condition, chiefly because
they cannot keep up with the young and strong sheep, which eat up
every blade of grass before the crawlers moving in the rear arrive.
Old ewes, if kept from breeding, will soon fatten, and ought then to
he sold to the butcher. We generally sell our wethers when they are
three years old. The mutton however is better, if they are not killed
until they arrive at the age of four, and the wool will pay the ex-
pense of keep; hut after four the fleece becomes lighter. The average
weight of our wethers is about 60 lbs. the four quarters", of ewes the
average is less. I have seen some wethers which averaged 80 lbs.;
but for one flock of this description, we have twenty which would
average less than 60 lbs. after being driven to Sydney or Melbourne.
Owing to the unprecedentedly depressed state of the colony about
two years ago, when a large proportion ef the colonists, having ruined
themselves and others through extravagance and wild speculation,


had filed their schedules and applied at the Insolvent Court for a
whitewashing certificate, the price of live stock, and, indeed, of every
other species of colonial property, was reduced to a mere trifle. The
market was glutted with sheep, cattle, and horses belonging to insol-
vent estates, and now offered for sale by the creditors. Numberless
flocks and herds exchanged owners. Prom Monday to Saturday, rap,
rap, rap went every auctioneer’s hammer; but it was evident that, in
so limited a community as that of New South "Wales, these large
daily sales of live stock could not long continue. Neither did they.
The demand was fully supplied; all the buyers had now disappeared,
though the sellers still continued to pour into market their sheep,
cattle, and horses, which were at last sold for a mere song—sheep at
Is., cattle at 55., and horses at 30s. a-head. This fearful crisis led
stockholders to rack their brains in attempting to devise some means
of saving the colony from impending ruin, by enhancing the value of
live stock; and necessity was here the mother of invention. The
bright idea of boiling down our surplus fat sheep and cattle for their
tallow, occurred to our esteemed colonist Mr. Henry O’Brien, J.P.,
of Yass, and a large stockholder. He first tried the experiment on
some of his own fat wethers; the trial was eminently successful. He
realised from Bs. to 9s. per head from his wethers. He pressed—he
urged others to follow his example. He not only published the result
of his experiment, but—like his famous countryman Dan, in a less
worthy cause—agitated, agitated, until he had the satisfaction of seeing
numerous boiling-down establishments in full operation. The conse-
quence was, that within a few weeks sheep had doubled, and in some
cases had tripled their prices. After Mr. O’Brien had succeeded in
reducing to practice his grand and original, though extremely simple
conception, hundreds of miserable scribblers came forward to inform
us that they knew, many years ago, that sheep contained tallow, and
that this tallow might be extracted from the lean by the process of
thorough-boiling. To Mr. O’Brien the stockholders of New South
Wales are under deep obligation. In consequence of his discovery,
it is perfectly evident that sheep and cattle cannot, at least for many
years, fall below a certain price in Australia. The price below which
they are not likely to be sold is, of course, the market-value of the
quantity of tallow, &c., produced from the boiled-down animal, after
due allowance is made for the expense of boiling. The Sydney mer-
chants will buy tallow as readily as they buy wool, for the London
market. The price of tallow in London varies, I believe, from ,£4O
to £45 per ton. In Sydney they give about £3O cash for it. The

chants will buy tallow as readily as they buy wool, for the London
market. The price of tallow in London varies, I believe, from ,£4O
to £45 per ton. In Sydney they give about £3O cash for it. The


expense of boiling is 6d. a head for sheep, and ss. for cattle. But the
skin and lean of a sheep will sell for more than double the expense of
boiling; while, at some establishments, the hide and tongue of a
bullock will be taken in full payment of boiling, thus leaving to the
stockholder all the tallow of his sheep, and both the tallow and the
lean (excepting the tongue) of his bullock.
It has been found that the tallow from a flock of fat wethers of an
average size, will yield to the owner at the rate of ss. a head, after
paying all expenses ; and that a fat bullock, of an average size, will
produce nearly two cwt. of tallow, or to the value of nearly £3 in
Sydney or Melbourne. These, then, are about the prices below
which, in my opinion, our sheep and cattle, if fat, are not likely to be
sold in any large numbers. If the animals are not fat, they will pro-
bably sell for much less, if forced into the market. In June last I
bought a small flock of sheep which belonged to an insolvent estate,
at 2s. a head. In November I had them shorn ; they averaged about
2| lbs. wool, which I sold in Sydney for Is. 3d. per lb. cash, or rather
more than 3s. a fleece. Any settler who has an extensive and fatten-
ing run, might now safely speculate in purchasing sheep and cattle in
low condition, if young and healthy. Since the boiling-down esta-
blishments have come into operation, our butchers have been obliged
to give about the same prices which the animals, if boiled down,
would produce to the owner.
To any man of tender feelings no spectacle can be more revolting
than the sight of a butcher with an axe entering a fold of perhaps a
thousand sheep, and knocking them down right and left, without
stopping to bleed them. He is followed by men with knives, who
bleed the fallen heaps kicking and struggling with death. The havoc
committed in a few minutes is horrible; the whole flock is pros-
trated ; the fold is deluged with blood; and the silence of the scene is
only broken by the confused gurgling noise from the throats of
hundreds of dying animals. The ferocious-looking men, whose trade
it is to perform this disgusting work, never consider it any part of
their duty to shorten as much as possible the sufferings of those dumb
creatures.
A fall in the price of tallow in the London market would, of
course, lower the price of live stock in Australia; but the tallow-
market in England is not subject to very great fluctuation, and the
immense increase of machinery now applied to the purposes of manu-
facture in that country, is more likely to produce an upward tendency
in the price of tallow. Besides, our boiling-down establishments

have recently begun to manufacture gelatine from what had hitherto
been a perfect waste. This gelatinous matter, which is now selling
well, and is likely to form an important article of exportation from
this colony, is expected to be adequate to the expense of boiling, thus
leaving to the stockholder the hide, worth Bs. or 10s., in addition to
all the tallow from his bullock. Several cases of this gelatine have
been lately shipped for London, and other parts of the world.
You are perhaps aware, that connected with the hind-quarters of a
sheep there is but comparatively little tallow or fat: therefore these
quarters have recently, in numerous instances, been converted into
Mutton Hams , which sell well, and which some Sydney epicureans,
and other men learned in the profound science of gastronomy, have
pronounced to be equal in taste and flavour to your real Yorkshire
hams. A cargo of these mutton hams is now on the way to China.
The diseases to which sheep are liable in this colony are nearly
the same as in Great Britain, and of course the remedies are the
same. The two principal diseases which have frequently thinned
our flocks are, the scab and the catarrh. The catarrh (sometimes
called the influenza) is fearfully rapid in its progress, and is most to
be dreaded in the months of July and August, being the coldest, and
generally the wettest, season in Australia.
For catarrh there are two remedies. The first is to shift the
flocks, and to continue shifting them into and folding them upon
new ground, thus preventing them from feeding or folding two
successive days or nights in the same place. To accomplish this ob-
ject, all that is required is that the shepherd should feed them from
place to place, at a considerable distance from the hut, and, instead of
driving them home towards evening, camp them all some
sheltered range. If they have been well fed during the day, they
will quietly lie down at sunset, and so remain anywhere until sun-
rise. The shepherd of course carries his blanket, his tinder-box, and
a day’s rations, with which he is regularly supplied. His dog, and a
line of large fires he makes in the evening round about his sheep,
will enable him to sleep quietly all night, without any fear of attacks
from native dogs. I have known of many flocks having thus got rid of
the catarrh. The second remedy, recommended and adopted by many,
is extremely short and simple, viz., to cut the throat of every dis-
eased sheep, and burn the carcase. If the carcase is not burned, the
native dogs and carrion-hawks may convey the contagion to a great
distance. The scab also has been thus conveyed to distant flocks.
Low clayey soil is very inimical to sheep suffering from catarrh.

For folding-ground choose, if you can, dry acclivities and granite
soil.
The symptoms of catarrh are the same as those of the epidemic
murrain which prevailed in Europe about the middle of the last cen-
tury, viz., discharge at the nose, running at the eyes, drooping of the
ears, and heaving of the flanks. The disease had been introduced
into England by a tanner, who imported the hides of some diseased
cattle from Holland. The disease itself is inflammation of the chest,
lungs, and brain.
The scab may either he received by contact with infected sheep,
or be generated by the sheep being kept too long in dirty yards or
folds. Some weeks elapse after the disease is caught before it makes
its appearance. It generally breaks out on the arrival of wet weather.
Fortunately, however, it is a disease which it is not very difficult to
cure. Medical men have given it as their opinion that the disease
itself is nothing hut an insect, which insinuates itself and spreads
under the skin, causing perpetual irritation, and that it is analogous
to that disgusting disease called the itch, which is still common
among the poorer classes of England, Ireland, and Scotland.
Various remedies have been prescribed for the scab. The most
effectual and now the common way of removing it, is the following .
Put into a large tub or vat 1 oz. of corrosive sublimate, 1 gill of
spirits of turpentine, 1 lb. of soap, a little salt, and 2 lbs. tobacco-
stems, boiled about four hours in five gallons of water, boiled down
into three gallons.
Then put the scabby sheep (all except the eyes) into the tub, vat,
or cask, half-full of this compound, and let the animal remain there
for one minute. The soap is used only to soften the skin. The to-
bacco-juice and mercury are the only active agents in effecting the
cure. Two men should be employed in currycombing the sheep thus
immersed, so as to scarify the skin, and lay open parts of it to receive
the medicine. It is desirable to have a spout, so as to carry the
liquid running from the sheep's back again into the tub. The liquid
compound must, of course, he renewed or strengthened from time to
time as the process of dressing proceeds. Five men can thus dress
200 sheep daily.
The following precautions are necessary :—avoid dressing them
when it is likely to rain; let them not drink any water for a day or
two after dressing, and keep them on the following day in the shade.
In order to render the cure certain, three dressings are required, and a
fortnight should intervene between every two dressings.

Sheep infected with the scab seldom fall off in condition. Scabby
sheep are often very fat; but the great evil consequent on this dis-
ease is, that before shearing-time arrives all the wool is gone, partly
by the animal continually rubbing its skin against trees, &c.
Foot-rot is generally caused by the sheep being kept grazing over
soft swampy ground, and frequently driven through creeks and
muddy places, or folded in dirty yards. The shepherd may easily
get rid of this disease by always avoiding such places as have now
been mentioned, by a proper application of a little blue-stone, after
washing or removing the dirt from the feet affected, and by feeding
his sheep on high ranges and sound hard ground.
It would be very difficult to state the exact prices at which good,
young, and healthy ewes could now be bought in New South Wales.
A slight rise has lately taken place in the wool market here; the
colonists are gradually recovering from their late difficulties; the
pecuniary crisis has nearly passed ; forced sales of sheep have become
less common; public confidence begins to he restored; the numerous
boiling-down establishments throughout the colony have helped to
prop up the tottering settler ; and as our hanks of issue have ceased,
at the close of last year, to allow any interest on deposits, the money
hitherto locked up there now begins to find its way into circulation.
All these combined circumstances have greatly contributed to influ-
ence our sheep-market, and I do not think that choice ewes can now
be bought here under 7s. or Bs. a head. I know of some mixed flocks
having lately been sold at from ss. to 6s. 6d. a head. lam of opinion
that, under good management, sheep, I mean young ewes, bought at
20s. a head, will yield a fair profit to the owner, even supposing the
price of wool never to exceed Is. 3d. per lb. I can see, however, no
probability of the very best of our Australian sheep realizing 20s. a-
head within the next few years, unless some new colony is formed in
our neighbourhood, or some such mad scheme as the Australian Agri-
cultural Company introduced, to turn the heads of the colonists. You
are doubtless aware, that in the year 1824 a grant of one million of
acres at Port Stephens, situated eighty-five miles north from Sydney,
was made to a company of London speculators. The concern has
never paid them; and the monopolists themselves are very unpopular
in the colony, chiefly in consequence of their claiming and exercising
an exclusive right to work the coal-mines at Newcastle, at the mouth
of the river Hunter, seventy or eighty miles north from Sydney.

Soon after the receipt of this extensive grant of land, the com-

purchase live stock. The intelligence of the arrival of such an
immense amount of capital produced a perfect mania among the
colonial stockholders, as well as among those who would he stock-
holders. Sheep, cattle, and horses, rapidly exchanged owners;
settlers mortgaged their farms, and borrowed money at ten per cent,
to invest in sheep bought at £2 and £2 10s. per head. There was
soon a reaction, which continued for some years. In 1835-6 and 7,
when a number of respectable emigrants, with capital, continued to
arrive by almost every ship from England, sheep steadily advanced in
price—until in 1837, ewes sold in Sydney at £3 and £3 ss. a head.
The following paragraph, which I copy verbatim from a Sydney news-
paper, of date May 1837, now before me, will prove that what the
colonists then most needed was a cargo of strait-jackets, and a place in
a lunatic asylum.
“ Isaac Simmons & Co. sold yesterday the undermentioned flocks of sheep,
viz.:—
£ s.
500 aged wethers for • . . . « .• . . 700 0
250 four-year old ewes with lambs, at 60s. each . . . . 750 0

800 four-year old ewes, maiden ewes, male and female lambs, at 40s.

£3,445 15
The only apology that can be offered for the buyers is, that the
sale took place when the moon happened to be full; a period which
was, no doubt, purposely fixed upon by the cunning seller.
At that time, several young men bought sheep at about £ 3 a head
on five years’ credit, paying ten per cent, interest, or, in other words,
paying yearly 6s. for the rent of everp sheep, and having at the end of
five years to pay £3 as the purchase-money; hut before the end of
the fifth year the best sheep were selling for less than those beardless
speculators had to pay as the yearly interest: the result was, that
they had to ride post haste into the Insolvent Court.
To enable a man to become a sheepowner, it is not necessary for
him either to buy land or to become a squatter. He will have no
difficulty in meeting a respectable stockholder, who will receive and
graze his sheep on what is called halves ; that is, the grazier receives
yearly one-half of all the wool, and one-half of the increase from the
flock. Suppose, for example, that you buy a flock of 600 ewes, and
give them out on halves. At the close of the year, the grazier to
whom you have given them on halves , delivers to you, in Sydney or
Melbourne, 300 fleeces of wool, and hands to you what is called a


purchase live stock. The intelligence of the arrival of such an

colonists then most needed was a cargo of strait-jackets, and a place in
a lunatic asylum.
“ Isaac Simmons & Co. sold yesterday the undermentioned flocks of sheep,
viz.:—

500 aged wethers for • . . . « .• . . 700 0
250 four-year old ewes with lambs, at 60s. each . . . . 750 0

each . . . . a a a a . • 1,600 0
£3,445 15
The only apology that can be offered for the buyers is, that the
sale took place when the moon happened to be full; a period which
was, no doubt, purposely fixed upon by the cunning seller.
At that time, several young men bought sheep at about £ 3 a head
on five years’ credit, paying ten per cent, interest, or, in other words,
paying yearly 6s. for the rent of everp sheep, and having at the end of
five years to pay £3 as the purchase-money; hut before the end of
the fifth year the best sheep were selling for less than those beardless
speculators had to pay as the yearly interest: the result was, that
they had to ride post haste into the Insolvent Court.
To enable a man to become a sheepowner, it is not necessary for
him either to buy land or to become a squatter. He will have no
difficulty in meeting a respectable stockholder, who will receive and
graze his sheep on what is called halves ; that is, the grazier receives
yearly one-half of all the wool, and one-half of the increase from the
flock. Suppose, for example, that you buy a flock of 600 ewes, and
give them out on halves. At the close of the year, the grazier to
whom you have given them on halves , delivers to you, in Sydney or
Melbourne, 300 fleeces of wool, and hands to you what is called a


yearly return , shewing that your 600 ewes have reared probably 540
lambs, of which 270 belong to you, and have been added to your 600
ewes; next year, allowing five per cent, for deaths among your ewes,
you will have 940 sheep to shear, from which you will receive one-
half, or 470 fleeces ; together with this wool you will also receive a
return of the increase—probably amounting to ninety per cent., or
about 510, of which one-half, or 255 are added to your flock, now
making the number of your sheep about 1,150, after making allow-
ance for deaths, casualties, &c. Before the close of the third year,
your first lambs have begun to breed also, and thus to co-operate with
your original ewes in adding to your increase ; after this your flocks
will go on multiplying rapidly and increasing like a snow-ball. The
system of giving out sheep on halves (it used to be on thirds till
lately,) is very convenient for those gentlemen whose capital is but
small, or who may not wish for a year or two to form stations for
themselves.
But now, supposing that you prefer to squat, and to have all your
sheep under your own eye or superintendence, you wish to know what
you have for your own accommodation, and that of your shepherds,
on a squatting sheep-station. To stand a whole year’s siege in the
Australian wilderness against such enemies as cold, hunger, &c., your
full complement of military force and defensive armour will be as fol-
lows :—first, a hut for your men and another hut for yourself. These
two huts you and your hut-keeper, with the assistance of two of the
black natives, may build in three or four days. It will perhaps appear
incredible to you that a dwelling-house twenty feet long, twelve or
fourteen feet wide, and with the walls six or seven feet high, should
be put up in two days. Yet I can assure you that such a wonderful
achievement as this has often been accomplished; and your surprise
will probably cease when I tell you that the walls and roof of such a
house are hark, and that it is quite common to see a sheet of bark eight
feet wide and nine feet long, or seventy-two superficial feet, it is
generally from one inch to one and a half inch in thickness, and is
nearly as tough and strong as a deal-board of the same dimensions.
One black fellow can cut off the trees, with his tomahawk, twenty such
sheets of bark a-day. I have seen sheets measuring 9 X 10, or ninety
square feet each. These sheets of bark, when placed as a wall to a
house, have their lower ends fixed six or eight inches in a rut cut out in
the ground, and their upper ends fastened by means of twisted filaments
of tough, stringy bark, to the wall-plate of the house; the roof-sheets
are generally fastened in the same way by their upper ends to the


yearly return , shewing that your 600 ewes have reared probably 540
lambs, of which 270 belong to you, and have been added to your 600
ewes; next year, allowing five per cent, for deaths among your ewes,
you will have 940 sheep to shear, from which you will receive one-
half, or 470 fleeces ; together with this wool you will also receive a
return of the increase—probably amounting to ninety per cent., or
about 510, of which one-half, or 255 are added to your flock, now
making the number of your sheep about 1,150, after making allow-
ance for deaths, casualties, &c. Before the close of the third year,
your first lambs have begun to breed also, and thus to co-operate with
your original ewes in adding to your increase ; after this your flocks

the ground, and their upper ends fastened by means of twisted filaments
of tough, stringy bark, to the wall-plate of the house; the roof-sheets
are generally fastened in the same way by their upper ends to the


ridge-pole. The side of the hark which had been next to the tree is
kept inside the house, and gives it the clean and whitish appearance of
a house built of polished deal-boards, eight or nine feet square. Such
a house is warm enough for this climate ; and it may be so constructed
as not to admit a single drop of rain. The watchman’s box is built of
the same materials.
In addition to the hut, the following articles are generally allowed
to every sheep-station :—One iron pot, one frying-pan, one spade, one
bucket, one wood-axe, one beef-cask, one sieve, one steel hand-mill
with which to grind the wheat, and some weighing-machine, for issu-
ing the weekly rations ; also one hammer, one or two gimlets, and a
few hurdle-nails. Every shepherd is expected to provide himself with
a blanket, tin quart-pot and pint-pot; in the quart-pot he makes, and
out of the pint-pot he drinks his tea. A quart-pot is often used at
sheep-stations as a measure for dealing out the wheat rations to the
men ; eight qnarts being one peck.
For your own use in your hut you may provide whatever delicacies
and luxuries you may fancy; but if you are either a philosopher or a
true soldier, you will, at least for the first year, live on the same sort
of food as you give your men, viz., beef or mutton, bread made from
flour, and tea and sugar. The only luxury I would recommend you
to provide yourself with would be a few interesting and useful hooks
to afford you amusement, and shake your ribs with laughing during
the long winter evenings when you are alone. Your bedstead will
consist of four forks driven into the ground for corners or posts, on
which are placed lengthways two, and crossways half-a-dozen, sticks,
thus forming a parallelogram. Beef or mutton you can probably buy
from your next neighbour at Id. per lb.; wheat at from 4s. to ss. per
bushel, until you can grow wheat of your own, which you ought to do
by next year. Tea, sugar, soap and salt for twelve months, you are
supposed to have brought with you from Sydney.
The man who acts as your hut-keeper and watchman at the station
cooks and washes for you, and also catches and saddles your horse for
you when you wish to ride. .
At the proper time sheep shearers are travelling from station to
station; and when shearing is over, if you have no drays and bullock-
teams of your own, you can engage at a moderate rate a regular
carrier to take your wool to Sydney: but in the event of your preferring
to have your own teams, you shall see, if you will take the trouble of
reading the following chapter, how you can best provide yourself with
a choice team of working bullocks. .

In the meantime I have to apologise to you for the great length of
these observations on the management of sheep. The general import-
ance of the subject (wool being the staple article of Australia) appeared
to me to justify a slight deviation from the rigid laws of brevity.

CHAPTER IX.
CATTLE.
To the emigrant who intends to commence as a cattle-grazier, I
would recommend to buy a mixed herd. By a mixed herd is meant
cattle consisting of cows, heifers, bullocks, steers, and calves, nearly
in equal proportions and of all ages. The chief advantage of this
arrangement is, that he has at once in his own herd bullocks which he
can either break in for his dray, or slaughter for the use of the men on
his station, while the steers are growing up to fill the place of the
bullocks already used. If, like many raw, inexperienced beginners,
he buys only cows and heifers, he must wait three or four years before
he can touch any of his herd, and during all this time he is obliged to
buy bullocks for his work, and beef for his own and his men’s rations.
A mixed herd of from three hundred to five hundred, or from sixty to
a hundred of each sort of cattle above named, would be quite sufficient
as a commencement; and, at the usual rate of increase, would in a few
years stock a very extensive run. Such a herd as I have now named,
could at present be bought here at from fifteen to thirty shillings a
head, according to their breed and condition. One bull is generally
allowed for every forty or fifty cows and heifers in the herd. Nothing
varies so much here as the price of bulls. I have seen £4OO paid for
two small animals, the one aged eighteen months, and the other
twenty months—but they were imported from England. A very
superior colonial-bred bull may now he bought for £lO or £l2.
During the six years ending with 1842, no fewer than seven hundred
and ninety-five horned cattle, chiefly choice bulls and cows, were
imported into this colony.
In selecting a run for your herd you must bear in mind that to
shift or remove a cattle-station is far more difficult than to remove a
sheep-station. Sheep require no breaking-in to a run. They will
contentedly feed anywhere; besides, they are followed all day, and

In selecting a run for your herd you must bear in mind that to
shift or remove a cattle-station is far more difficult than to remove a
sheep-station. Sheep require no breaking-in to a run. They will
contentedly feed anywhere; besides, they are followed all day, and


every night confined within hurdles. It is otherwise with cattle. It
takes at least six months to reconcile them to a new place, how rich
and abundant soever may be the pasture. I have known them to find
their way hack three hundred miles to the place on whieh they were
bred. But then, after they are once fairly broken in to a new run,
they seldom leave it of their own accord, and it is generally a work of
no small difficulty to drive away from their usual run a draft of fat
bullocks for the market. The strong attachment manifested by cattle
to home, coupled with the fact of their being necessarily allowed to
remain out all night, forms one reason why you ought to he particular
in fixing on a place whence natural causes, such as scarcity of water,
scarcity of grass, or scarcity of room, will not oblige you for some
years to remove.
There is another reason which renders it advisable for you to pitch
your camp with your herd on a spot holding out some fair probability
of fixity and permanency ; in the formation of a cattle-station, it is
necessary to erect substantial stockyards, which, in case of removal
cannot be so easily carried away as hurdles and watch-boxes from
sheep-stations.
I shall suppose, then, that you have displayed judgment in the
selection of a locality for your cattle-station. The first improvement
you ought to make, after taking possession of your run, is to set fire to
the grass ; if it happens to he the season of the year, viz., the end of
summer, dry autumn, or dry frosty winter, on a windy day, when the
grass will burn. If you can, hum every blade of it from one end of
your run to the other, and never mind what has been published in
London against this practice of ours by Count Strzelecki, who recently
made a tour through Australia. The Count’s argument, that by burn-
ing the grass, its roots, —in consequence of long exposure to a scorching
sun, in such a dry climate as New South Wales, —are permanently
destroyed, is built upon a theory, of whieh practice and universal
experience, the only legitimate tests, demonstrate the fallacy.
For many years it has been found throughout the colony that the
oftener you burn the grass the thicker it grows, and that while sheep,
cattle, and horses, half starve in the midst of miles of grass up to their
flanks, it is no sooner burnt, than there springs up from its roots a
thick mantle of sweet and nutritious green foliage, on which all sorts of
live stock rapidly thrive and fatten. And accordingly every Austra-
lian settler, whether living on his own purchased land, or is merely a
squatter, whose meadows are covered with long dry grass, takes the
earliest opportunity of burning it. I have annually spent several


every night confined within hurdles. It is otherwise with cattle. It
takes at least six months to reconcile them to a new place, how rich
and abundant soever may be the pasture. I have known them to find
their way hack three hundred miles to the place on whieh they were

lian settler, whether living on his own purchased land, or is merely a
squatter, whose meadows are covered with long dry grass, takes the
earliest opportunity of burning it. I have annually spent several


days in this sort of employment. I have humt scores of miles of thick
grass, four or five feet in height, over my sheep and cattle-runs.
Viewed from a convenient height an hour or two after the sun has
disappeared below the horizon, there is an approximation to the sub-
lime in the spectacle of forty or fifty miles of long and thick grass in
one mass of conflagration. As you could form no idea of it from
anything that I am able to write, I will not here attempt a description.
You can picture to yourself the irresistible impetuosity of the flame,
sweeping away in its progress every semblance of vegetation—“ before
it is as the garden of Eden, behind it, a desolate wilderness,” the
atmosphere heated for many miles —dense volumes of smoke carried
athwart the sky—birds, snakes, and quadrupeds hurrying away from
the coming destruction—kangaroos, opossums, bandicoots, and emus,
rushing forward, being driven from their hiding-place. Commingled
with the crackling of burning reeds, you hear the hissing of serpents
and chirping of birds, and then crash, crash, crash, the gigantic trees,
which stood for ages, as they now in rapid succession come tumbling
to the ground. As far as vision extends you see, furiously blazing
across the darkened space the flames have swept, thousands and thou-
sands of lofty hollow trees, from the top of whose cavities, as from so
many tunnels or pillars of fire, issue myriads of clear flames, illumi-
nating the forest far and wide, and presenting the appearance of a grand
exhibition of nature, or of some fantastic fairy scene, on a scale truly
magnificent. But until you have seen all this, it is impossible for you
to form a correct idea of its sublimity and grandeur. By means, how-
ever, of a few lucifer matches, you can here repeat this scene, a scene
compared with which your boasted Yauxhall pyrotechnics are but a
childish bagatelle, and even the burning of Troy would dwindle into
insignificance.
Having burnt the grass, there is another thing you must do before
bringing your cattle on the run. You must build on an elevated
ground near where you intend having your hut, either a three-railed
fence, inclosing about an acre, or a stockyard sufficient to contain
your herd, as they must for the first few months he what is here called
tailed, that is, followed daily by a man on horseback, and guarded or
confined in a stockyard by night, to prevent them from returning, as
they will attempt to do, to the run whence they came. I deem it
unnecessary to describe the extent, form, divisions, &c., of the stock-
yard, as you must see on your way so far into the hush a great variety
of stockyards of all sizes.
The following is a list of what men and things you will require to


days in this sort of employment. I have humt scores of miles of thick
grass, four or five feet in height, over my sheep and cattle-runs.

In drawing out this estimate, I have taken it for granted that your
hut-keeper has driven your team, carrying the supplies to the station,
that he and you have put up the huts and stockyards while the stockman
is daily out after the cattle—that you killed your own beef—that you
brought with you from England a couple of blankets, your double-
barrelled gun, and some powder and shot. If you are a married man,
as you certainly ought to he before settling in the bush, you will he
able to do without a hired hut-keeper after the first year, and thus
save a considerable item of expense, and live much more comfortably.
But it is very possible that your predilection for a bachelor’s life
may he invincible, and that in utter defiance of what I have here said,
you may he determined to continue in practical infidelity, by disbe-

In drawing out this estimate, I have taken it for granted that your
hut-keeper has driven your team, carrying the supplies to the station,
that he and you have put up the huts and stockyards while the stockman
is daily out after the cattle—that you killed your own beef—that you
brought with you from England a couple of blankets, your double-
barrelled gun, and some powder and shot. If you are a married man,
as you certainly ought to he before settling in the bush, you will he
able to do without a hired hut-keeper after the first year, and thus
save a considerable item of expense, and live much more comfortably.
But it is very possible that your predilection for a bachelor’s life
may he invincible, and that in utter defiance of what I have here said,
you may he determined to continue in practical infidelity, by disbe-
lieving the scriptural declaration that “ it is not good for man to be
alone,” and yet he desirous to reduce as much as possible your
expenses. In such a case employ a family, the husband to act as


stockman, and make himself generally useful, his wife to act as hut-
keeper ; and if they have any children above seven or eight years of
age, they may be very useful in driving home your milkers, feeding
pet calves, and pigs, &c. The yearly wages now given to a family of
this description are about £2O, with double rations. They pay for
whatever rations they may draw from your store over their stipulated
allowance. Never hire any man who will not consent to sign a
written agreement, containing a clause binding him to make himself
generally useful. All old hands have a mortal antipathy to this clause.
But unless it is inserted in their agreement, it is evident that five
hundred unforseen and totally unexpected things may require to be
done which they, if they choose, may legally refuse to perform.
As soon as you have got over the hurry occasioned by building
your huts, making a garden, and enclosing with a two-railed fence a
paddock for wheat, you ought to employ your stockman and hut-
keeper, every morning, in milking as many as they can of your cows,
and in breaking in to bail all your heifers, or young cows that have
just calved for the first time. Milk them all, even if you should, in
the absence of pigs and pet calves, throw away the milk. Unless
your cattle are remarkably quiet, I would strongly recommend the
formation of a dairy. The direct profits from it might not perhaps
cover the expense of conducting it and of the dairy utensils, but ulti-
mately you would be a large gainer. With wild cattle you can do
nothing. They are perfectly unmanageable. The falling of a leaf
will disturb them in their pasture. The sight of a man will drive
them away at a full gallop for many miles. They never fatten. You
can never drive them to market. You can never break them in to
work. They will attack your horse and rip him up, if you'succeed
in heading them, and attempt to drive them back. If, after some
days’ hard riding, accompanied by half-a-dozen men on horseback,
and after knocking up a score of horses, you at last are fortunate
enough to drive a third or even a fourth of them into a stockyard,
they will furiously attack you if you venture inside. I have been
attacked by calves a few days old, which came bellowing and roaring
towards me, and I have seen a cow repeatedly clear a stockyard of
half-a-dozen strong men, one of whom she caught on her horns, and
tossed him high in the air, like a boy’s play-ball. He was now truly
on the horns of a dilemma. We, of course, all waited to see him
come down again without his hat. These wild Russians , as they are
here called, will, as I have often seen, clear, at the first leap, a stock-
yard six feet in height, and there is only one thing that can tame


stockman, and make himself generally useful, his wife to act as hut-
keeper ; and if they have any children above seven or eight years of
age, they may be very useful in driving home your milkers, feeding
pet calves, and pigs, &c. The yearly wages now given to a family of
this description are about £2O, with double rations. They pay for

come down again without his hat. These wild Russians , as they are
here called, will, as I have often seen, clear, at the first leap, a stock-
yard six feet in height, and there is only one thing that can tame


them; —and what is that ? It is to yard them often, and to form a
dairy. So generally known is the fact that keeping a dairy tames the
cattle, that stockholders frequently request as a favour of their ser-
vants to milk for their own use as many of the cows as they can
collect. It has been found that the calves of cows that are regularly
milked thrive fully as well as the calves which are left to suck the
whole of their mother’s milk; and then, when these civilised calves are
weaned, or turned out, they quietly feed and very soon fatten. The
stockman and hut-keeper may milk, before breakfast, from thirty to
forty cows; the same cows being milked only about four months in
the year (dating the period from the cow’s calving), upwards of one
hundred of them may thus be milked within twelve months. There
are men in this colony who can milk forty cows daily, if they are
driven into bail for them, and this would only be an amusement for
yourself in the morning. Cows are milked only once a-day at cattle-
stations. After the cows are milked, the calves are allowed to accom-
pany them out on the run, and to remain with them until three
o’clock, p.m., when they are all driven into the yard, the calves put
up for the night in their pens, and the cows allowed to remain out
feeding in the wood until next morning, when they either come home
of their own accord to their calves, or are driven home to the yard by
the stockman to be milked. The dairy utensils you will require, in
case you wish to make butter and cheese, are—one churn, four buckets,
six cheese-vats, six milking piggins, one large iron pot, one butter
tub, one skimmer, one strainer, about forty large shallow tin dishes,
and some butter-casks. You must, of course, build a dairy-house. It
ought to be in a cool place, and have a double roof.
There are some men in this colony, such as Mr. Howe, of Glenlee,
Mr. George Eankeen, of Bathurst, &c., who have derived large incomes
from the profits of their dairies.
I shall now suppose that your cattle are fully broken-in to their
new run, and require no yarding at night, and that if they have been
naturally wild, they are in a fair way of being tamed by the estab-
lishment of a dairy; that you have, at least, half-a-dozen acres under
wheat, well fenced; and that you have a garden producing abun-
dance of vegetables. The additional improvements which you ought
now gradually to make are the following—and I may as well here
mention that I copy them from my own head-station, at which I have
resided during the last two years and a half.
Stable, barn, storehouse, an additional wheat paddock, a large
heifer paddock (into which you can put your calves which are fit to


them; —and what is that ? It is to yard them often, and to form a
dairy. So generally known is the fact that keeping a dairy tames the
cattle, that stockholders frequently request as a favour of their ser-

dance of vegetables. The additional improvements which you ought
now gradually to make are the following—and I may as well here
mention that I copy them from my own head-station, at which I have
resided during the last two years and a half.
Stable, barn, storehouse, an additional wheat paddock, a large
heifer paddock (into which you can put your calves which are fit to


be weaned), and a small paddock, near the huts, for your riding horses
and working bullocks. This last paddock will save you much time
that would otherwise be lost in searching for your horses and bullocks
when required. In one of your cultivation-paddocks you ought to
raise hay and green barley, to enable you to keep your own horse
chiefly in the stable, and if you have sheep-stations within two hun-
dred miles, you ought to grow wheat enough to spare for their supply.
If you select your station on a river, you may find angles of it which
will form two-thirds of your paddock-fence. One of my grazing-
paddocks is formed by running a straight fence from one angular point
to another, and thus including the space contained in a large bend of the
river in the shape of the letter C. I have thus seen a forty acre culti-
vation-paddock inclosed by eighteen yards of fencing! This will give
you some idea of the circuitous and meandering character of our rivers,
thus prolonging their stay among us; and, indeed, so beautiful are
the valleys through which they run, that you need not be surprised at
their unwillingness to leave them.
Without a weaning or heifer-paddock, you will be obliged to allow
your calves to continue sucking their mothers for a whole year, to the
serious injury of the latter; and you will also be obliged to allow
your heifers to have calves, as in such circumstances they often have,
before they aro twenty months old. The result will be, that many of
them die in calving, and that, if you allow the survivors to rear their
calves, the growth of the mother is stunted, and the calf will be a
disgrace to your herd. Nothing tends more to deteriorate a herd than
to allow the heifer to breed at too early an age. They ought to be
three years before they are sent to the bull. It is also necessary that
you should change your bulls every third year, so as to prevent the
possibility of breeding in —the result of which has been found to be in
this colony to produce both a wild and a diminutive race.
One circumstance which has tended much to improve our breed of
cattle, is the splendid feed which, in most parts of the colony, they
have at all times of the year. Theoretical men may talk as they
like about the breeding of cattle, but I have no doubt that one of the
most effectual means of improving them is by well feeding them at all
seasons of the year. It would surprise an Englishman, newly arrived
in the colony, to see some of our bullocks, which were never under
the roof of a house, and which had never anything to eat except the
natural grass they picked up in the forest, so very fat as to be unable
to walk. The beef of these bullocks is equal in taste and flavour to
any stall-fed beef you ever tasted in England. It is, however, infe-


be weaned), and a small paddock, near the huts, for your riding horses
and working bullocks. This last paddock will save you much time
that would otherwise be lost in searching for your horses and bullocks
when required. In one of your cultivation-paddocks you ought to

any stall-fed beef you ever tasted in England. It is, however, infe-


rior in tenderness to the beef of Scotland, where the fattening of cattle
with oil-cake and other such abominations is fortunately unknown.
The Australian beef might be much better than it is, if cattle pro-
prietors were not in such a hurry to convert all their fat bullocks into
money. No bullock, however fat, ought to be killed until he is at
least four years old. A bullock grows until he is five years or up-
wards, and to kill him before that age is a loss to buyer and seller:
the meat of a very young bullock is neither firm nor palatable, and on
its being boiled, it shrinks to two-thirds of its original bulk. Any
tolerable judge in these matters can tell whether it is young or aged
beef, by merely seeing it on his plate at a dinner-table. A large
number of our Australian fat bullocks are killed before they are three
years old. Hence the loose texture of the beef, and the compara-
tively small proportion of fat with which it is intermingled.
Our cattle here are scarcely subject to any disease, except what is
called the black leg , which is very rare, and which attacks only very
fat and young cattle. To remove this disease, all that is necessary is
to yard the herd, and allow them to feed only two or three hours out
of the twenty-four.
It would puzzle a conjuror to tell what is our breed of cattle in
Australia. Our breeds of cattle are as numerous, though not, per-
haps, so vicious, as our breeds of bipeds. If every county in England,
Ireland, and Scotland, has contributed to increase our stock of bipeds,
many counties in England, and a few in Scotland, have contributed
to replenish our breed of cattle. The late Rev. Mr. Marsden intro-
duced an excellent breed of polled cattle, called the Suffolks.
THE HEIFER-STATION.
In the course of some years your heifer-paddock will, in all pro-
bability, yield but a scanty supply of grass for the increasing number
of calves necessary to be weaned, and the heifers which are too young
for breeding. In such a case, your best, if not only, remedy, is to
form what is called a heifer-station. This is what I had to do lately;
and, though there is nothing either new or very interesting in my
proceedings on that occasion, a detail of them may perhaps be of use
in guiding you at some future period, when your first cattle-run
becomes overstocked. Accompanied by two of my neighbours, I
started in search of a station. Each of us was well mounted, and
supplied with a blanket, greatcoat, some provisions, tin quart-pot,
tinder-box, flint and steel, and hobbles for our horses. We had also
a tomahawk and a pocket compass. With the compass we steered our


rior in tenderness to the beef of Scotland, where the fattening of cattle
with oil-cake and other such abominations is fortunately unknown.
The Australian beef might be much better than it is, if cattle pro-
prietors were not in such a hurry to convert all their fat bullocks into

wards, and to kill him before that age is a loss to buyer and seller:

THE HEIFER-STATION.
In the course of some years your heifer-paddock will, in all pro-
bability, yield but a scanty supply of grass for the increasing number
of calves necessary to be weaned, and the heifers which are too young
for breeding. In such a case, your best, if not only, remedy, is to
form what is called a heifer-station. This is what I had to do lately;
and, though there is nothing either new or very interesting in my
proceedings on that occasion, a detail of them may perhaps be of use
in guiding you at some future period, when your first cattle-run
becomes overstocked. Accompanied by two of my neighbours, I
started in search of a station. Each of us was well mounted, and
supplied with a blanket, greatcoat, some provisions, tin quart-pot,
tinder-box, flint and steel, and hobbles for our horses. We had also
a tomahawk and a pocket compass. With the compass we steered our


course by day, and with the tomahawk we cut two or three sheets of
bark in the evening, and thus made a comfortable house to shelter us
from wind and rain during the night. We built our house opposite
to some large dry log, to which we set fire. We always hobbled our
horses on some good feed near us, and if they rambled, which they
seldom did, we could easily track them next morning. We steered
our course in the direction of the junction of the Hume and Murrum-
bidgee, and nearly midway between these two rivers. About one
hundred miles from my head-station, I found a place possessing, in
my opinion, the necessary requisites for a cattle-station, viz., plenty
of grass, plenty of water, and open forest-land, together with the
additional recommendation of large plains, some of which measuring a
thousand acres, without a tree, and ready for the plough.
Mobs of wild cattle and a few naked blacks were the only occu-
piers of this beautiful place, of which I now took possession,—not in
her Majesty’s name, —but in my own. I then hastened back to my
nearest station—about fifty miles—wrote to the District Commis-
sioner, describing the boundaries of my new run, and applying for his
permission to occupy it. And then, lest some other squatter might
chance to follow my track, and afterwards pretend that he was the
first discoverer, I immediately returned with men, tools, dray, bul-
locks, and provisions, and commenced building. The only two
buildings requisite for a heifer-station are, a hut for the men, and a
stockyard or paddock for the cattle. I selected and pegged out, near
a deep lagoon, an elevated spot for a hut, twenty by twelve feet, the
height of the walls to be six feet. For this magnificent palace I
engaged to pay, when finished, thirty shillings. I also fixed on a dry
situation for a paddock, 150 yards square, containing, of course, an
area of nearly five acres. Various reasons induced me to prefer a
paddock to a stockyard. A paddock, affording to cattle plenty of
room, not only increases their chance of escaping from those vicious
animals among themselves that would horn them, but of all finding a
dry spot on which to rest during the night, a luxury not to be enjoyed
in a confined stockyard, which, during the winter, is generally one
uniform slough, often up to their flanks. This might do well enough
twice or thrice in the year, but it would not answer in the case of
cattle which must be confined every night for some months in the
stockyard.
Another reason for preferring a paddock to a stockyard is, that by
the time the cattle are broken in to the run, and may be left out all
night, your paddock has been well manured , and be ploughed up and


course by day, and with the tomahawk we cut two or three sheets of
bark in the evening, and thus made a comfortable house to shelter us
from wind and rain during the night. We built our house opposite
to some large dry log, to which we set fire. We always hobbled our
horses on some good feed near us, and if they rambled, which they
seldom did, we could easily track them next morning. We steered

uniform slough, often up to their flanks. This might do well enough
twice or thrice in the year, but it would not answer in the case of
cattle which must be confined every night for some months in the
stockyard.
Another reason for preferring a paddock to a stockyard is, that by
the time the cattle are broken in to the run, and may be left out all
night, your paddock has been well manured , and be ploughed up and


converted into a cultivation-enclosure, yielding abundance of wheat
for the supply of the station. Your men are then also at leisure to
build the necessary stockyard.
The only timber which my men could find near, that would split
for rails, was pine. Near them was a whole forest of pine, sufficient
to huilda city; but it is very bad building timber, and ought never to
be used when stringy-bark can be obtained. I stipulated that the
posts for the paddock should be either of gum or box, each of which is
abundant here, and is very durable. My own bullock-driver, with
my team, was engaged to drive in all the stuff or materials for the
buildings above mentioned.
While I remained with the men making these arrangements, I was
visited by a party of fifty or sixty blacks, one of whom, an old man,
named “ Jackey Jackey,” stated that I was on his ground, over which
he and his family always hunted. I said I would buy it from him,
and describing to him the best way I could, how far I wished to occupy,
desired to put a price on it, and I would pay him; —to which he
replied, that it would be a new man-shirt, a knife, a big piece of beef,
a tobacco-pipe, and that many (holding up five fingers) of figs tobacco.
I told him I would pay him his price; and accordingly, at the very
earliest opportunity, I paid him more than double the price he set on
my run of about thirty square miles. Each of us was well pleased
with his bargain; and he promised that neither his dogs nor the
people belonging to him should ever disturb my cattle. He has been
very useful to mo in cutting bark and looking after my horses.
After having paid two or three visits to this station, and seen that
everything was ready, I drafted and drove thither all calves fit to be
weaned, and all the heifers under two years old, together with a lot of
steers and bullocks. I placed them under the charge of two stockmen,
who were supplied with three good horses and two saddles, provisions
of wheat, tea, sugar, and salt, for four or five months. They were to
kill a bullock for themselves. Besides the two stockmen, whose busi-
ness it was to follow the cattle every day and to yard them every
evening, there was a hut-keeper, under whose charge the supplies
were placed. Steel-mill, sieve, iron pot, spade, axe, saw, iron wedges,
maul, bucket, milk-dish, and beef-cask, with the splendid thirty
shilling mansion already described, constituted the sum total of their
accommodation. To the stockman in charge of the herd at the cattle-
station strict orders should be given to kill the calf of every heifer or
young cow that may calve on the run, for it is impossible always to
prevent a stray bull from running in among them.


converted into a cultivation-enclosure, yielding abundance of wheat
for the supply of the station. Your men are then also at leisure to
build the necessary stockyard.
The only timber which my men could find near, that would split
for rails, was pine. Near them was a whole forest of pine, sufficient
to huilda city; but it is very bad building timber, and ought never to
be used when stringy-bark can be obtained. I stipulated that the
posts for the paddock should be either of gum or box, each of which is
abundant here, and is very durable. My own bullock-driver, with
my team, was engaged to drive in all the stuff or materials for the
buildings above mentioned.
While I remained with the men making these arrangements, I was
visited by a party of fifty or sixty blacks, one of whom, an old man,
named “ Jackey Jackey,” stated that I was on his ground, over which
he and his family always hunted. I said I would buy it from him,

One of the most important duties to he performed on a cattle-
station is mustering. This is done at least once, and sometimes twice
a-year, and generally when the stockyard is dry. The mustering of
cattle in this colony is a work full of excitement, and, considered as a
sport, is equal to any fox-hunt or steeple-chase you have ever witnessed
in England. The object of mustering all the cattle may he either to
draft fat bullocks for the market, or to cut and brand the calves, and
wean, by sending either into the paddock or to the heifer-station,
those of them which are of sufficient size to do well enough without
their mothers. A few days before you intend mustering, you send
notice to half-a-dozen of your neighbours, requesting their presence
and assistance. They, expecting a similar favour from you next
week, will attend. You have kept your horses fresh for the occasion.
On the morning of muster all the inner gates of the stockyard are
generally opened, and all the outer , except one, are shut. The horses,
perhaps a dozen, stand saddled and ready at the door. Each rider is
armed wfth a stock-whip, the handle of which is only a little more
than a foot in length, while the thong is twelve or fourteen feet long.
"With this whip a stockman can cut a piece clean out from the skin and
flesh of a bullock. The report from the crack of it may be heard at
the distance of some miles. Boots, spurs, trowsers, shirt, and cap,
generally constitute the whole dress of the rider. All being now
mounted and followed by a few cattle-dogs, they start at a slow pace
to one end of the cattle-run, where, after having arranged to meet
again on some large plain or open ground within a few miles of the
stockyard, they divide into parties of two or three. Each party scours
its allotted gullies, creeks, and hack-ranges, driving down gvery horned
beast towards the plain of general rendezvous. The cattle no sooner
hear the loud crack of the stock-whip than they scamper away towards
their usual camping-place, with the fury and determination of a dog
to whose tail a drum or an old kettle is tied, the rider in full chase
after, until he succeeds in heading the cattle and driving them in the
right direction.
One end of the run being thus cleared, the different parties now
meet on the appointed plain, with all, or at least the greater part, of
the cattle in that direction. The accumulated herd thus collected is
now driven by the united riders towards the stockyard.

their lost calves, and of calves for their lost mothers —the roaring of
rival bulls, now brought into close contact; the bellowing of bullocks
that lost their companions ; the barking of dogs ; the cracking of


stock-whips ; the shouting of riders; the rearing and prancing of
excited horses ; the tramp, tramp, tramp, of a thousand head of cattle
of every description, all attempting to break away into the forest.
Then is your time of action ; bring up the rear ; check the galloping
van; drive in the scattered flanks; hit out; give your horse his head;
clear the fallen timber; dash through the mire; onward, onward;
splash mud and water; never mind your lost hat.
To people who live at the distance of some miles, the position and
approach of this immense moving body are indicated by a volume of
dust rising high in the air, and by a confused murmur of rumbling
noise wafted on the wings of the wind. The severest part of the
work has not yet commenced. On approaching close to the stock-
yard, the cattle make a last struggle to break away. It is then you
see equestrian performances. An old stock-horse knows his business
fully as well as his rider, and all that you need do is to give him his
head. With the quickness and agility of a French mountebank, he
will twist and turn, zig-zag—zig-zag —right to left—left to right—
according as the cattle he attempts to head move away. He will
then, when going, in Yankee style, right a-head at the rate of thirty
or forty miles an hour, suddenly stop and whisk about, describing an
acute angle, on finding that he has headed the runaways, to which he
now sticks closely until he sees them within the stockyard. When
the horse is describing these varied evolutions, he and his rider, unless
the latter is well on his guard, are likely enough to part company. I
have often witnessed such unexpected dissolution of partnership, for
“ facilis descensus.”
When the horses, fresh and fiery, started in the morning, they
looked clean, sleek, and of all colours; now, on their return to the
hut, trembling, hollow, exhausted, and languid, they are all of one
colour, viz., grey, or covered with one mass of foam and mud. And
the riders, who wore clean shirts on starting, have in the interval ex-
changed them for a covering of mud, mixed with perspiration. In
this short interval of six or seven hours, everything hut one has been
impaired—and what is that ? It is the rider’s appetite. Our deli-
cious climate, the mountain air, and the equestrian exercises, have so
sharpened the appetite, that the rider is ready to swallow and digest
everything and anything, except the shovel and the poker. I some-
times shuddered when I thought what would he the result, if any of
us had then lost his appetite, and a poor man found it. It would
have ruined him.

The cattle being now secured in the yard, if there is time this


evening, we draft them ;if not, we do it to-morrow morning. Draft-
ing consists in separating those that we want for any particular pur-
pose from those which we do not want, and which, therefore, are
turned out into the bush (woods), to remain there undisturbed, per-
haps, until next year. I shall suppose that your object on this occa-
sion is twofold ; Ist, to draft out a lot of fat bullocks for the market,
and, 2nd, to brand all your unbranded calves. The fat bullocks are
drafted into one yard, the unbranded calves into another, and those
cattle not wanted are drafted into a third yard. When this is done,
the fat bullocks are sent off for the market; the cattle not wanted are
counted out and allowed to into the bush; the calves are
branded. To do this, a large fire is kindled outside the stockyard,
and your brands are heated. In the mob of a thousand head brought
in yesterday, you have probably two hundred calves to brand. Your
men rope the big ones and pull them up to a post, throw them down,
and partly tie them. The very young ones are caught, and held
without the aid of a rope; then the brand is gently pressed against
the skin of the animal, until an indelible impression is produced.
You always brand on the same part, whether right or left, rump,
thigh, hip, or ribs of the animal. The owner, if present, generally
cuts and brands. An account is kept of the number of males and
females thus branded. Two hundred can easily be done daily.
Divers extraordinary and incorrect accounts of Australian cattle-
muster have been written by men who evidently were never in the
bush; for instance, one writer gravely states that “ the proprietor, if
present, generally cuts and brands himself.” I can only say that,
though I have attended many a cattle-muster during the last ten
years, I have neither witnessed nor heard of any such act being com-
mitted on the occasion. The calves under five months old are turned
out to their mothers in the bush ; those above that age are confined
in a separate yard, until they can be sent off with others either to the
Aveaning-paddock or heifer-station.
In the heifer-paddock you can keep the fat bullocks which you
have drafted, until you can send or accompany them into market.
Next day another division of the run is cleared, and the cattle on
it are mustered in the same way as I have described those of yester-
day ; you have generally fresh horses, and this work goes on until all
the calves are branded, and those which are old and strong enough are
weaned. You are not to infer that, since six months’ old calves are
weaned, and five months’ old calves are allowed to go into the bush,
you would therefore have to muster and wean every month of the


evening, we draft them ;if not, we do it to-morrow morning. Draft-

weaned, and five months’ old calves are allowed to go into the bush,
you would therefore have to muster and wean every month of the


year. Three-fourths of all your cows calve within two or three
months, that is between September and November, so that most of
your calves are fit to be weaned in March or April, our delicious
autumn. The different lots of cattle as they go out of the yard, are
counted under the following heads : —cows, heifers, bullocks, steers,
bulls, male calves, and female calves. From this calculation the half-
yearly returns for the government assessment for the next twelve
months are made out, and sent to the district commissioner; unweaned
calves are not counted. I never attended a muster either of my own
cattle or of any of my neighbours, without seeing several stray cattle
(or strangers , as they are called,) among every mob brought into the
stockyard; and this accounts for the readiness with which our neigh-
bours will assist you at a cattle-muster. The truth is, that it is not
so much to oblige you as to benefit themselves they attend. It is
self-interest—that grand moving principle of human nature—general,
uniform, and powerful as the laws of gravitation, that prompts them
to come to your assistance. They can thus secure and drive home,
from among your herd, their own stray cattle. Yet the arrangement
is good, and the benefit reciprocal; for by this means the stockholder
who has, perhaps, only two men to manage a herd of two thousand
head of cattle, can thus command, when required, the services of a
dozen men well mounted.
Having finished your mustering, drafting, and all your cutting and
branding, the cattle return to their usual beat; for all of them have
not only their favourite companions, but their favourite places of
feeding, camping and bedding, from year to year; and they will some-
times half starve rather than abandon their old haunts, even to fre-
quent places abounding with the richest grass. To induce them to
exchange an old favourite but barren spot for a good and distant place,
the exercise of some ingenuity is necessary. In order that they may
spread far and wide over the run, and enjoy the benefit of the best
grass, take a bullock’s hide well salted, and nail it, with the flesh side
outward , to a tree in some shady, cool, dry place, near which you see
plenty of grass and water. Drive now a mob of the cattle to the hide.
They will soon find out the salt; and for an hour or two about noon,
they will continue day after day licking the hide, until it is as thin as
a wafer; in the meantime their feet will necessarily dig the ground
around it, rendering it a soft and cool standing-place. After regularly
feeding within a short distance of it, they will continue for years
daily resorting thither. It is now a permanent camping-place.
After the muster, you may probably have to accompany your fat


year. Three-fourths of all your cows calve within two or three

feeding within a short distance of it, they will continue for years
daily resorting thither. It is now a permanent camping-place.
After the muster, you may probably have to accompany your fat


bullocks to Sydney or Melbourne. They should never be driven out
of a walk, and not more than twelve or fifteen miles a day. Use no
dog. If the weather is warm, allow them to camp in the middle of
the day; let them travel and feed early and late. If the stockyards
on the road are not dry, camp your bullocks out, and watch them all
night. After you are a day’s journey with them away from your run,
one man on foot could drive them the remainder of the journey.
Take a pack-horse to carry your provisions and blankets. When you
arrive within a few days of your journey’s end, write to two or three
butchers of the town; they will ride out to meet you. If you like
their offer, take it; if not, boil down your bullocks. In the event of
your not having a large number of bullocks fit for slaughter, you can
send them to market by one or other of your neighbours who is going
with a lot of his own, and will drive and sell yours, on condition that
you will perform a similar neighbourly act for him on another occa-
sion. We thus often oblige each other. Our fat bullocks generally
average about 700 lbs. the four quarters. I have some bulloks now
in my team that would weigh 1100 lbs. each, the four quarters ; and
I have heard of stockholders here who had bullocks which weighed
nearly 1300 lbs. the four quarters. Such bullocks, however, are very
rare in this colony.
You ought frequently to accompany your stockman out among the
cattle, however faithful he may be in the performance of his duties ;
your eye may often be better than his hands. If you have much
riding, you would require a number of saddle-horses; I generally keep
four or five for my own use. They are of little or no expense, the
government assessment of tax being only 6d. per annum; and I have
widely scattered stations to visit. During the last twelve months I
rode on an average nearly one hundred miles weekly.
When we want beef, we drive into the yard a small lot of fat bul-
locks, select one of them, drive a bullet through his brains, and then
let his companions escape into the bush. The four quarters are cut
up and salted next morning; the head, the heart, the liver, the feet,
and tripe, are all thrown in to the dogs. What is in this colony
thrown away, would feed many a family in England, Ireland, and
Scotland. The bullock’s horns are always thrown away. A Scotch
tinker who could work these horns into spoons, drinking cups, &c.,
would make his fortune here, and benefit the colony. The hide is
kept to be cut up for ropes. In this colony everything is held, tied, or
mended with green hide. Our loads of wool and hurdles are tied by
green hide ; our bullocks and horses are roped with green hide ; our


bullocks to Sydney or Melbourne. They should never be driven out
of a walk, and not more than twelve or fifteen miles a day. Use no
dog. If the weather is warm, allow them to camp in the middle of
the day; let them travel and feed early and late. If the stockyards

saddles and bridles are mended with green hide; our milch cows are
leg-roped with green hide ; our calves are tied up with green hide;
our broken fences are mended with green hide; our bucket and pot-
handles are made of green hide; our spurs are tied on with green
hide; our stock and bullock-whips are made of green hide ; our door-
hinges and hasps are made of green hide ; our house-frames and roofs

mended with green hide; our wheat is led home tied with green hide ;
our wheel-washers are made of green hide; green hide, instead of
canvas, covers the stretchers on which we sleep. Of green hide we
make sieves; of green hide we make leading-halters and lunging-
ropes. "With green hide many a convict has been taught obedience.
But time would fail me to enumerate half the virtues and uses of
green hide. Suffice it to say, that green hide, horses, and stringy-
bark, are the grand support and stay of Australia; without them the
whole fabric would totter and fall.
Nothing will more surprise you here than the quantity and quality
of eatables on the table of some of the old settlers at a cattle-station.
In the course of one day I have seen the following on a table which
consisted of a sheet of bark, nailed on four posts driven into the floor :
—beef, pork, ham, vegetables, eggs, fritters, butter, cheese, tea, sugar,
cream, damper, poultry, wild ducks, and fish fresh out of the river.
No wonder, then, that some people here should occasionally com-
plain of indigestion. The only article in the above list which you
may not probably understand, is damper. This is our bread baked
under the ashes. Men who have been long in tbe bush can, in a very
short time, convert wheat into bread for you. During a short visit I
made to my cattle-station about five years ago, my hut-keeper came in
at breakfast-time to inform me that there was no bread for dinner, and,
what was worse, the wheat was done; I was about ordering a horse
to be saddled, on which I was to send the stockman to my next neigh-
bour to borrow a bushel of wheat, when the hut-keeper informed me
that a corner of my own wheat was ripe enough. He accordingly
started with a sickle, reaped a sheaf, carried it home, thrashed it out
with a stick, winnowed the wheat, dried it for an hour by exposing it
to a hot sun, ground it by the steel mill, put the flour through the
sieve, made a damper, baked it, and it was cool before evening on my
riding home to dinner!

CHAPTER X.
BUSH AMUSEMENTS.
The chief sources of amusement you may freely enjoy in the bush
are the following: —fishing, hunting, shooting, riding, and reading.
Our rivers abound with fish of all sizes. We generally catch them
with a line and baited hook. If you are a true disciple of Izaak
Walton you may catch as many in a couple of hours—weighing from
half-a-pound to twenty pounds—as will supply your table for a week.
The most common sort are perch, bream, roach, carp, cod-fish, and
mullet. This last-named, as you know, is a fish which thrives equally
in salt and fresh water. I have seen cod-fish caught which weighed
from sixty to eighty pounds. But these very large ones are inferior
in taste and flavour to those of a smaller size. The blacks generally
catch their fish by spearing. At a single glance they aim at the fish,
and drive their spear through him with unerring precision, as he
swims at a considerable depth under the water’s surface. You would
suppose, from witnessing their skill and practice, that they studied, in
Newton’s Principia, all that is there stated on the angles of incidence
and reflection. They capture wild ducks in the same way as fish—by
spearing. The black fellow either crawls quietly on fours through
the long grass, or keeping a tree in a line between him and the ducks,
he softly creeps until he reaches the edge of the lagoon or river, when
he suddenly darts his spear, and generally secures one, if not two of
them.
Hunting is a favourite amusement here. The animals hunted are,
generally, the native dog, kangaroo, and emu. The native dog closely
resembles the English fox in size, shape, and cunning. The English
fox, however, is generally of one colour, viz., red, whereas, among the
Australian native dogs are some red, some brown, and some black.
They are very numerous, and extremely troublesome. They come
almost to the very door of the huts, and leap over the hurdles among
a flock of sheep on one side of the fold, while the watchman is in his
box on the other. A great number of calves—perhaps ten per cent, at
some out-stations —are yearly destroyed by them ; and when pressed
by hunger they will attack foals. I have seen several of my calves
which had their ears and tails bit off by these carnivorous animals.
To destroy them is, therefore, the great object of every stockholder, in
keeping a few kangaroo dogs, which are a breed between a pure

by hunger they will attack foals. I have seen several of my calves
which had their ears and tails bit off by these carnivorous animals.
To destroy them is, therefore, the great object of every stockholder, in
keeping a few kangaroo dogs, which are a breed between a pure


greyhound and a mastiff. At every station you find some of these
dogs, and, accompanied by them, some settlers spend a great part of
their time in riding over their runs in search of the native dog. He
smells as strong as the English fox, and the dogs no sooner come on
his scent, than they start at full speed, their noses to the ground.
When they get sight of him, you must let your horse out and follow
them. He will make hard either for the mountains or the river.
They soon catch him, and tear him to pieces. I lately came on four
of them together, tearing away at the carcase of a calf. They cun-
ningly fled in four different directions. I had only three dogs with
me, all of which followed one ; after a smart chase they caught him,
and fairly cut his throat. Some years ago, several stockholders in this
colony used to give two shillings and sixpence for every native dog’s
brush or tail produced; and then every man who wanted half-a-crown
tried to cur-tail them. Their harking is quite different from that of a
domesticated dog. It has been erroneously stated that they, being in
a state of nature, never bark ; and some writers have obstinately main-
tained that barking is entirely the result of civilization. lam aware
that the dogs carried by Columbus to America were afterwards found
by him to have lost their propensity to barking. They could merely
whine, howl, and growl. And the traveller Sonnini also states, that
the shepherds’ dogs in the wilds of Egypt possessed not the faculty of
barking.
The kangaroo is an extraordinary animal. There are several
kinds of them, and they are of various sizes. The kangaroo forester is
about five feet high, and when pursued by dogs, it leaps or bounds
from fifteen to twenty paces. The animal goes on his hind legs,
steering his body with his tail. His fore legs are only about half the
length of his hind legs. He is generally of the same colour as the
English hare, and his flesh greatly resembles in taste and appearance
that of the hare. The tail, which sometimes weighs twenty pounds,
is considered the best part of him. It makes excellent soup—indeed,
equal to any ox-tail soup I ever tasted. His movements in his native
wilds are extremely graceful. Seldom rapid, until he sees you and
your dogs in full chase after him, then he hits out in right earnest,
hops, skips, bounds, and if you have not fleet -dogs before you, and a
fleet horse under you, he is soon out of sight. In some parts of the
colony they are seen in droves, but I never saw more than five or six
of them together. I have often seen them quietly feeding among my
cattle, with which they seemed to live on peaceable terms.
When hard pressed, they turn about, put their backs to a tree, and


greyhound and a mastiff. At every station you find some of these
dogs, and, accompanied by them, some settlers spend a great part of
their time in riding over their runs in search of the native dog. He

of them together. I have often seen them quietly feeding among my
cattle, with which they seemed to live on peaceable terms.
When hard pressed, they turn about, put their backs to a tree, and


for a time successfully fight the dogs, which they often rip up and
disable for life. They have been known not only to drown dogs, hut
also to take a man in their arms, carry him towards a lagoon or deep
pond, and there attempt to drown him, as they commonly drown a
dog, by pressing his head under water. A friend of mine, a Mr.
James Aitken, settler on the Clarence Eiver, has lately received in a
battle with a kangaroo a mark which he will necessarily carry with
him to the grave. He was in chase after a kangaroo, which at last
his dogs caught, when my friend inconsiderately dismounted from his
horse for the purpose of assisting his dogs. The kangaroo now left
them and attacked Mr. Aitken, whose lip he completely tore. The
kangaroo is naturally timid, and is easily tamed. He lives entirely
on grass ; and the female has only two young ones at a time, which she
carries in a pouch or hag under her belly. When hard pressed in the
chase, she drops them one by one; you can then he certain that she is
nearly heat —all that a kangaroo has will she give for her life. The
skin is remarkably tough, and is converted into stock-whips, and
sometimes used as a substitute for a blanket in travelling through the
hush. With half-a-dozen of these skins sewed together a man could
comfortably sleep out all night on a bleak snowy mountain.
Lieut. Flinders, describing his first visit to Kangaroo Island,
situated near the entrance of Port Adelaide, South Australia, says :
“On going towards the shore, a number of dark-brown kangaroos
were seen feeding on a grass-flat by the side of the wood; and our
landing gave them no disturbance. It would be difficult to guess
how many kangaroos were seen; but I killed ten, and the rest of the
party made up the number to thirty-one, taken on hoard in the course
of the day; the least of them weighing sixty-nine, and the largest
one hundred and five pounds. These kangaroos had much resem-
blance to the largo species found in the forest-lands of New South
Wales, except that the colour was darker, and they were not wholly
destitute of fat. The animals were so tame as to allow themselves to
he shot in the eyes with small shot, and in some cases to be knocked
on the head with sticks. The supply amounted to an enormous quan-
tity of food. In gratitude for so seasonable a supply, I named this
southern land, Kangaroo Island. Never, perhaps, had the dominion,
possessed here by the kangaroo, been invaded before this time. The
seal shared with it upon the shores, but they seemed to dwell amica-
bly together. It not unfrequently happened that the report of a
gun fired at a kangaroo near the beach, brought out two or three bel-
lowing seals from under bushes, considerably farther from the water-

side. The seal, indeed, seemed to be much the more discerning
animal of the two; for its actions bespoke a knowledge of our not
being kangaroos, whereas the kangaroo not unfrequently appeared to
consider us to be seals.”
The emu is covered with hair rather than feathers, and accord-
ingly he never flies. lie stands from five to seven feet high, and is of a
ragged grey colour. I have seen nine or ten of them together. They
can run as fast as a racer, and it is very seldom they can be run down
by a man on horseback. I once had an old stock-horse, on which my
stock-man, who was rather too fond of field-sports, used to run down
emus—a feat which was here considered extraordinary. The emu
lays ten or twelve eggs. I have one of them now in my possession ;
it measures thirteen inches in circumference one way, and eleven
the other way, and is of a dark-blue colour. The emu has an oily,
disagreeable taste, and is seldom or never eaten by white men here ;
the blacks, however, are fond of it. A valuable oil is procured from
these birds, and this is the chief, indeed the only, satisfactory reason
assigned by white men for hunting them. When half-a-dozen emus
are viewed from a distance, majestically striding across the plain,
they look like a party of savages.
Shooting is here a common amusement. You are aware that in
this colony we have no game-laws, and therefore wild animals are
considered common property, to which all men have an equal right;
and, accordingly, every settler has his double-barrelled gun. I know
several boys, of ten or twelve years of age, who are first-rate shots,
the result of constant practice.
Among the animals which we have here to be shot, are the fol-
lowing : —native turkeys, which are very good eating; wild ducks,
with which some of our lagoons are covered, and are superior in fla-
vour and taste to onr tame ducks ; bronze-winged pigeons, which are
very numerous, and will allow you to get quite close to them; wild geese,
teal, and parrots, all of which are ..very good eating. The musk-duck,
native companion, and cockatoo, are common, but eaten only by the
blacks. The only quadrupeds usually shot are, the opossum, an
animal resembling a rabbit, —feeds on grass and leaves, carries its
young ones in the same way as the kangaroo, in a pouch or bag under
the belly, and lives in the hollows of decayed gum, box, or stringy-
bark trees. Opossums are very abundant, and it is a common amuse-
ment, especially among boys, to form parties to go out with guns, by
moon-light, to shoot these opossums as they jump from branch to
branch among the trees. Of their skins, beautiful cloaks are made,

one of which would be sufficient to keep you warm in the open air
during our coldest winter-night. Many a night have I slept under a
tree with no other covering than one of them. Bandicoots and kan-
garoo-rats are also very numerous, and are excellent eating. Both
white and black men are fond of them. The flying-squirrel is eaten
only by the blacks. The wombat, an animal resembling a bear, is
considered equal to pork. He burrows like a rabbit. One of them
was lately brought to me as a present by a tribe of blacks, who killed
in one day, on a mountain behind my hut, as many as the tribe could
eat during several days.
You will require all kinds of shot. Hall’s gunpowder is much
used here. Get a real Joe Manton , if you can; at all events, get
a genuine twist barrel and a percussion lock. With a good rifle
you might occasionally bring down a kangaroo, emu, or native
dog.
It is unnecessary for me to state, that riding is one of our common
recreations in the bush. If you are tired of either fishing or shoot-
ing, you order your servant to saddle your horse for you. Some of
your time will also be spent in attending the cattle musters of those
neighbours who assisted you on a similar occasion. Your nearest
neighbour is, perhaps, from eight to ten miles from you. But that is
only a short distance, and your horse will probably carry you thither
within one hour. You will, perhaps, have occasion often to visit one
or other of your neighbours for the purpose of borrowing or returning
a book or newspaper, or of spending the evening or dining with him,
&c. Strange to say, they have even their balls and dancing-parties
here, and you will see some very pretty currency lasses gracefully
moving through a quadrille, or playing on the piahoforte, four hun-
dred miles from Sydney, on the banks of the Hume !
I have already stated, that the people of this colony are fond of
reading. In the bush this is a favourite amusement. In several
huts you enter, you see the proprietor of the station wearing his
regatta shirt and fustain dress, and inhaling the fumes of tobacco
through a short black pipe, which he occasionally draws from his
mouth, in order to wipe away from his eye the tear of joy or of sorrow,
as he reads one or other of the novels of Sir Walter Scott, or of Feni-
more Cooper, or of Dr. Bird, or of Bulwer, or of Smollett, or Tom
Cringle’s Log Book, or Sam Slick, or Dickens’s Works, or Chambers’s
Journal. You will also see, resting on roughly-constructed shelves
behind him, a few volumes on history, chemistry, philosophy, and
travels by sea and land. You will be as agreeably surprised as I

And let me assure you that such an honest attempt at peace-making
as this seldom fails of producing its intended effect.
Having given you a glance of our bush life, you and I shall now
start for Sydney.

CHAPTER XI.
SYDNEY.
Observe now, as we ride along our Macadamized streets, how
nearly all of them, at equal intervals, cut each other at right angles.
A large portion of the ground along one side of that main street
belonged to a tailor who came out with the 102nd regiment. About
ten years ago he sold a great part of it for £4O a foot frontage. The
land on your left was sold at £67 a foot, in the year 1834. There
were then no buildings on either of these lands. Notice the great
number of Jewish names on the shop signs—there are “Abraham,
Isaac and Jacob, Joseph and Benjamin, Moses and Aaron, Samuel and
Solomon, Jeremiah and Ezekiel, Judas and Beelzebub,” &c., in part-
nership. The ten lost tribes found their way to Sydney; that
accounts for it. Look at our splendid shops, some of them fully equal
to those of second-rate in London. Behold what fine buildings are
these!—all of freestone, and built chiefly by Scotch masons. See
what magnificent quarries, all of freestone, and in blocks of enormous
dimensions, we have here in the very heart of Sydney. The whole
city is built upon one immense rock, of various elevations and depres-
sions, but all composed of this valuable solid material; and it was not
without reason that the honest Scotch mason, when, a few days after
his arrival here, he was asked by a friend of mine what he thought
of the colony, replied, “ Hech mon, it is an unco braw kintra for
stanes.” See what a splendid view Sydney commands of Port Jack-
son, and what a magnificent harbour is ours! The whole British
navy might ride here in safety. It is completely land-locked. The
entrance is, no doubt, narrow, only about a mile—and there is, inside
the entrance, a bar ; but there is a fine light-house on the south-
head, close to the entrance, for the guidance of ships; and many a
large vessel has sailed over the bar, close to a part of which, called


have been on finding so large an amount of intelligence among long-
bearded bushmen wearing nothing but fustian.
It is in the bush you really enjoy, after a day’s ride, some inter-
esting volume, —and much tallow is thus consumed by the intelligent
settlers fond of reading. But tallow costs them nothing; they make
their own candles, and either the mould in which they are made, or
the neck of a bottle, or a lump of wood with an inch augur hole in it
serves for a candlestick. A foot-long piece of iron hoop bent double,
and retaining some of its elasticity or spring, serves for snuffers.
The floor or fire-place is the tray. Truly, “ man wants but little
here below.”
I think I have now said enough to show you that in the bush we
spend an active life, and enjoy the opportunity of blending the agree-
able with the useful.
Clerks who have rambled into the bush on a leave of absence from
public offices —youngsters from school, who, during the holidays, have
visited their fathers’ stations shopkeepers, lawyers, soldiers, and
sailors, who have made an excursion into the bush to gratify a feeling
of curiosity—have found our field-sports too strong an allurement to
be resisted, and, accordingly, either remained in the bush, or soon
afterwards returned to its healthy exercises and enjoyments.
Here you experience a buoyancy of spirits and a freedom from
care unknown among the busy haunts of a crowded population. Here
you have to contend with no jarring interests —no under-hand
rivalry. You may live as you choose. You are “monarch of all you
survey.” Here the freedom of the savage and the comforts of civili-
zation are conjoined. The patriarchal simplicity of life is restored.
Here solitude invites to meditation, and rural exercise sweetens en-
joyment. Here may be found that lodge in a vast wilderness, after
which prophets, and poets, and lovers have sighed. “ Beatm ille , qui
procul negotiis,” exclaims every settler who is capable of appreciating
the beauties of nature, —and especially that greatest of all beauties—
his cattle, sheep, and horses, increasing around him, and holding out
to him the reasonable prospect of leaving his children, if not in afflu-
ence, at least beyond the fear of want. Here you may live in peace
with all men; for if perchance any dispute about the boundaries of a
run should arise between you and any of your neighbours, you may
well address him as Abram addressed Lot, “ Let there be no strife
between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen;
for we are neighbours. Is not the whole land before thee? Separate
thyself from me; if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the


right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.”
And let me assure you that such an honest attempt at peace-making
as this seldom fails of producing its intended effect.
Having given you a glance of our bush life, you and I shall now
start for Sydney.

CHAPTER XI.
SYDNEY.
Observe now, as we ride along our Macadamized streets, how
nearly all of them, at equal intervals, cut each other at right angles.
A large portion of the ground along one side of that main street
belonged to a tailor who came out with the 102nd regiment. About
ten years ago he sold a great part of it for £4O a foot frontage. The
land on your left was sold at £67 a foot, in the year 1834. There
were then no buildings on either of these lands. Notice the great
number of Jewish names on the shop signs—there are “Abraham,
Isaac and Jacob, Joseph and Benjamin, Moses and Aaron, Samuel and
Solomon, Jeremiah and Ezekiel, Judas and Beelzebub,” &c., in part-
nership. The ten lost tribes found their way to Sydney; that
accounts for it. Look at our splendid shops, some of them fully equal
to those of second-rate in London. Behold what fine buildings are
these!—all of freestone, and built chiefly by Scotch masons. See
what magnificent quarries, all of freestone, and in blocks of enormous
dimensions, we have here in the very heart of Sydney. The whole
city is built upon one immense rock, of various elevations and depres-
sions, but all composed of this valuable solid material; and it was not
without reason that the honest Scotch mason, when, a few days after
his arrival here, he was asked by a friend of mine what he thought
of the colony, replied, “ Hech mon, it is an unco braw kintra for
stanes.” See what a splendid view Sydney commands of Port Jack-
son, and what a magnificent harbour is ours! The whole British
navy might ride here in safety. It is completely land-locked. The
entrance is, no doubt, narrow, only about a mile—and there is, inside
the entrance, a bar ; but there is a fine light-house on the south-
head, close to the entrance, for the guidance of ships; and many a
large vessel has sailed over the bar, close to a part of which, called


the “ Sow and Pigs,” there is always stationed a tub of a vessel
serving for a light-house, with a family living on board. A seventy-
six gun ship (Her Majesty’s Warspite ), 1960 tons, and drawing 24
feet water, has entered Port Jackson. I think, therefore, that few
merchant-vessels have anything to fear. A few of our buildings, you
see, are slated, though the great majority of them are shingled, or
covered with pieces of split wood, of the size, shape, and appearance
of slates. In some of the houses coals are burnt; in others wood is
used as fuel. Here we come to the house where, in November last,
poor Mr. Warn, whom I knew, was murdered by his servant, James
Bidel; who, after completely fracturing his skull with a large axe,
attempted to burn the body on his own fire, but failing in this, he cut
the half-burnt carcase up into pieces, and packed them in a box, which
he was carrying away when he was detected. He was tried, con-
victed, and hanged. There is the house in which Mrs. Jamison, a
poor widow, who kept a small shop, was last year murdered by Sir
Edward Knatchbull’s brother, who expected to find some money in
her till. Since his arrival in this colony, under sentence of transpor-
tation, he committed various crimes. While he lived he was a curse
to society, and a disgrace to his family and high connections, —and at
last he died on the scaffold the death of a dog.
Notice the amazing diversity of physiognomy among the crowds
of passengers on each side of us; what villany depicted in the coun-
tenances of some of them ; all the water of Port Jackson could never
wash away the mark of Cain which they bear on their foreheads.
You observe that stout coarse-looking man riding near us ; he was a
convict, hut he is now a bank director, and possessed of immense
property. Twice was he on the eve of being hanged. Since his
arrival as a convict in the colony, he had actually the rope about his
neck, on a scaffold erected at the intersection of King-street and
George-street, hut was saved just in articulo mortis by a reprieve
from the governor. You see that portly good-natured looking dame
who is passing us in her splendid carriage. She was transported to
this colony for stealing a donkey. She still displays her judgment in
horse-flesh. Stop, stop, here comes at full speed, driving his tandem,
the man who robbed the Glasgow hank. He managed the affair so
cleverly! He and his accomplices were living in Edinburgh, and
having ascertained when the box containing the exchanged bank-
notes was to be forwarded to Glasgow, they engaged all the seats in
the mail. It was a dark night: midway on their journey they con-
trived, by means of brace and hits, to cut an opening into the hoot of

the mail. It was a dark night: midway on their journey they con-
trived, by means of brace and hits, to cut an opening into the hoot of


the coach, whence they extracted the money-box, and quietly de-
camped across the fields. Mr. , you now see driving the tan-
dem, was the ringleader, who was, soon after the robbery, apprehended,
tried, convicted, and transported to Botany Bay. His wife soon after-
wards arrived here with the Glasgow bank-notes converted into gold,
with which these fine buildings you now see before you were erected.
You notice these open carriages filled with well-fed and well-dressed
gentlemen. These gentlemen are the directors of the defunct hank of
, the failure of which has plunged many a widow and orphan,
both here and in England, into misery and ruin. One of these gen-
tlemen-dircctors helped himself to £BO,OOO, another to £40,000, and
a third to £30,000, and so on.
One thing you could not have failed to notice as they severally
passed you, viz., the immense size of the organ of acquisitiveness as
developed in the head of every one of them, and the total absence of
the organ of conscientiousness. In one respect, however, we squat-
ters ought to feel grateful to these directors; for at the late public
meetings held in Sydney on the subject of the new squatting regu-
lations, these are the men who then contended most manfully for
us, in order to secure, if possible, what is called fixity of tenure. In
discussing our petition praying for this boon, they eloquently argued,
that without fixity of tenure, no situation, either within or beyond the
boundaries of location, was worth any man’s acceptance, and scouted
the anticipated ideas of Mr. George Miller, of the Savings’ Bank, who,
in an evil hour, happened to say that in the present state of things,
fixity of tenure would not, in his opinion, be for the public good. I
believe the governor stated, that this was the only point on which he
could conscientiously agree with the petitioners ; and that in all his
despatches to the Home Government, he, as a consistent whig, was
doing everything in his power to secure fixity of tenure. Here comes
a row of carriages; the gentlemen in them are driving straight for
the Insolvent Court to file their schedules. Not a doubt of it; for
did you not see them come from Mr. Norton’s office, where they have
been securing their property to their wives? and, having done so, they
now intend to pay their creditors just two-pence halfpenny in the pound.
As soon as they have passed through the Court, and received their white-
washing certificate, after having conscientiously sworn that they have
given up everything they possessed, they will again commence busi-
ness on an extensive scale, and with a large capital unexpectedly
sprung up, nobody knows whence; while, in the mean time, their

dear wives, to each of whom £SOO a-year has been secured for life,


receive their generous husbands—of course out of pure gratitude—
into a participation of this yearly income.
You seem to think that this statement is a little exaggerated.
Not a jot. Hear what has been given in evidence on the 25th No-
vember, 1843, before a Committee of the Legislative Council, by a
man who is thoroughly acquainted with the mercantile community of
Sydney, and had no motive whatever to misrepresent facts. I have
been permitted to consult the minutes of evidence then taken, and since
printed at the expense of the Government, and I will here repeat to
you part of of Mr. L ’s evidence: —
“You have carried on extensive business in Sydney for many
years ?—I have. What amount of debts have you proved under the
present insolvent laws ?—Upwards of £33,000. What dividend have
you received ?—I have received £BOO, or about 6d. in the pound.
Will you state what frauds are committed under the present insolvent
act ?—lt has been generally the case, that persons have not gone into
Court till they have made over their property to various persons, and
have had nothing left for their creditors. Frauds have thus been fre-
quently committed. It is a common thing when an insolvent is
asked what has become of his property, for him to say, ‘ I kept no
books.’ There is the case of Mr. ; he states in his examina-
tion, that he has been a merchant for ten years, and that for the last
three or four years he had three vessels trading here, and he values
their cargoes at upwards of £60,000, and he kept no books. Then
there is , who failed for upwards of £200,000; he also states
that he kept no books! Persons conceal their property, or dispose of
it to friends; for there is not an insolvent that walks the streets now,
but is dressed in better clothes and better boots than they were before
they passed the Court. I see none with their elbows through their
coats, or toes through their shoes; they are to be seen dashing and
driving about in their carriages. What proportion of the cases that
come before the Insolvent Court do you believe to be of a fraudulent
kind ?—I should say forty-five out of fifty are fraudulent. Do you
think then that forty-five out of fifty of the insolvents have perjured
themselves ?—I do.”
There is a picture for you! In fifteen months, that is, from Feb-
ruary Ist, 1842, to April 29th, 1843, no fewer than 714 persons have
gone through the Insolvent Court in Sydney, and the total amount of
their liabilities was £1,754,877 (one million, seven hundred and fifty
four thousand, eight hundred and seventy-seven pounds sterling), and
the dividend they paid did not average one shilling in the pound!

The heaviest failure of these was that of the firm of “ Halt, Balance,
and Diddle.” It would appear from Alderman Myndert’s exclama-
tion (in Cooper’s “Water Witch”), that there was only one firm of this
name in New York, but there were several firms of this name in
Sydney, and to prevent mistakes in the delivery of letters it was
found necessary to address these different firms as follows :—“ Halt,
Balance, and Diddle, the first,” “Halt, Balance, and Diddle, the
second,” “ Halt, Balance, and Diddle, the third,” and so on. Most
of these, however, have already gone into the Insolvent Court; but a
few of them still remain, doing business in Sydney. Check your horse
a little : you see the crowd in that auction-room. There is a public
sale going on there, of goods of every description, just arrived from
London : the auctioneer is knocking them down at less than one-half
the London prices! You need not look surprised —the importers of
these goods never intended to pay for them. They ordered them with
this intention, and they are now selling them by auction in order to raise
the wind, pocket the profits, and then, like other honourable gentlemen,
walk into the Insolvent Court. Here is the school for teaching new
chums how to do business; and in what corner of the globe, let me
ask, would you expect to find perfection in the mercantile art —which
is very often the art of cheating—if not here, where we have the col-
lective wisdom of 96,558 pickpockets, thieves, swindlers, robbers,
murderers, &c. ? for this is the number of convicts sent to Van Die-
men’s Land and New South Wales, at an expense to the mother
country of £7,724,640, up to the end of 1836; and you see, I have
given the last batch of them eight years to procure their tickets-of-
leave ; for eight years is the period which the colonial law requires a
convict transported for life should serve previous to his obtaining
what is called a ticket-of-leave, enabling him to move about at his
pleasure in the colony, and benefit society with his experience and
counsel.
The London merchants have themselves alone to blame. They
trust and consign their goods to men here whom they have not suffi-
ciently tried and proved. Few of our Sydney merchants deserve the
name ; most of them being only penniless adventurers, ship-brokers,
and commission-agents—as destitute of principle as they are of capi-
tal, and proud as Lucifer. A man contrives to borrow or scrape
together two or three thousand pounds, and with this paltry sum he
thinks himself justifiable in commencing business as a Sydney mer-
chant. It ought, also, to be borne in mind, by London consigners,
that our community is yet so very limited that a large quantity of

thinks himself justifiable in commencing business as a Sydney mer-

that our community is yet so very limited that a large quantity of


any one kind of goods gluts the market, when forced sales become
ruinous. An article is scarce, and consequently dear: every one then
sends for a supply; the result is, that this supply, being so greatly
disproportioned to the demand, must either remain long unsold, or
one-half of it be sold at considerably less than the original cost. The
time to order an article for this colony is when that article is here very
plentiful; this conclusion may appear paradoxical; it is, nevertheless,
the result of continued observation. It will he found, that by the
time the new supply has arrived, the article has become scarce : it
had been a drug in the market. So many lost by it last year; and
therefore nobody has ordered a fresh supply of it. Hence the impor-
ters may now have a monopoly. London merchants, who are gene-
rally honourable and high-minded gentlemen, are little aware of the
meanness which characterises some of our soi-disant Sydney merchants,
alias brokers and ship-agents. Within the last week a case has come
to my knowledge, of a captain of a ship now in harbour, who
called at his agents’ office to pay his account for provisions, &c.,
supplied to him; when he was asked whether it was his own or the
owners’ account he wanted to he made out. The explanation is this :
If the ship has not been consigned by the owners to any particular
agent in London, hut is left to the captain to bestow that honour and
profit on whom he chooses, the agent, out of gratitude, gives the
captain, by way of a bribe, a large per centage —from five to ten —on
all sums paid by him for provisions, stores, &c., supplied by the agent.
Two different accounts are accordingly made out, and duly discharged
.—one of them private and confidential , for the captain, which is all he
really pays—and which is, moreover, at the rate of the regular Syd-
ney market prices ; the other account is for the owners , and amount-
in gto from five to ten per cent. more. An honest captain will, of course,
scorn to soil his fingers in any such infamous transaction. As some
people know me to be intimate with Captain Morrice, of the Elizabeth ,
whose agents are Messrs. Lyall and Scott, George-street, I deem it
but an act of justice to state, that they are not the parties to whom I
here allude; and I may further add, that I have reason to believe these
gentlemen to be honest and honourable men in their dealings.
There are now in our harbour three ships consigned to one firm in
Street. Two of these ships were consigned to this firm by the
respective captains of the vessels on arrival here. The third ship was
consigned from London to the firm by the owners of the vessel. The
two captains who voluntarily consigned their vessels to the firm,
receive every mark of attention, and are regularly invited to cham-

agent in London, hut is left to the captain to bestow that honour and
profit on whom he chooses, the agent, out of gratitude, gives the
captain, by way of a bribe, a large per centage —from five to ten —on
all sums paid by him for provisions, stores, &c., supplied by the agent.
Two different accounts are accordingly made out, and duly discharged
.—one of them private and confidential , for the captain, which is all he
really pays—and which is, moreover, at the rate of the regular Syd-
ney market prices ; the other account is for the owners , and amount-
in gto from five to ten per cent. more. An honest captain will, of course,
scorn to soil his fingers in any such infamous transaction. As some
people know me to be intimate with Captain Morrice, of the Elizabeth ,
whose agents are Messrs. Lyall and Scott, George-street, I deem it
but an act of justice to state, that they are not the parties to whom I
here allude; and I may further add, that I have reason to believe these
gentlemen to be honest and honourable men in their dealings.
There are now in our harbour three ships consigned to one firm in
Street. Two of these ships were consigned to this firm by the
respective captains of the vessels on arrival here. The third ship was
consigned from London to the firm by the owners of the vessel. The
two captains who voluntarily consigned their vessels to the firm,
receive every mark of attention, and are regularly invited to cham-


pagne dinners, and evening parties; whereas, the poor unfortunate
captain who had no vote or discretionary power in the choice of agents
for his ship—she having heen consigned by the London owners to the
firm —is left unnoticed, to eat his salt junk dinner week after week on
hoard his own vessel. And yet one of this firm has the impudence to
drive daily, with a livery servant in his gig, through Sydney, begging
freight for these ships.
Let us now pass on to see the steamers. Every two or three
hours of the day a steamer starts for Parramatta; and almost every
evening a steamer starts for Hunter’s River, calling at Newcastle.
Steamers go regularly to Port Macquarie, and Clarence River, to
the north ; also to Port Phillip, Launceston, Yan Diemen’s Land, &c.
See what a busy scene our harbour presents—what an immense number
of vessels for so young a colony! From the year 1822 to 1842, inclu-
sive, 219 vessels, of the aggregate tonnage of 11,095, have been built
in the colony of New South Wales; or yearly, ten vessels, averaging
fifty-two tons each. You see the great number of wharfs, with deep
water alongside, and so arranged, not only that vessels of large ton-
nage may discharge their cargoes without the intervention of con-
necting planks, hut that these cargoes might even he hauled up by
means of the ropes and pulleys you see, into those large stores conti-
guous to the wharfs. What a number of people moving in all direc-
tions! Every two or three you see there collected are talking of
pounds, shillings, and pence, or the chances of some begun, continued,
but not yet ended speculation. If any of the gentlemen there, who
happen to know you, should invite you to dinner, be assured he has
some design on you. He either knows or believes that yoq have both
money and credit; and he expects, by means of champagne and a
little flattery judiciously applied, either to find his way into your
pocket direct, or to obtain your endorsement to a hill. I have reason
to believe that many of our Sydney dinner-parties are given with this
intention. If you go to them, button up your pockets; your host has
beautifully-preserved salmon for you —hut he is also fishing for gud-
geon and flat; they are the only fish for which he cares.
The immense quantities of animal food used by both males and
females in this colony cannot fail to be injurious to health and to per-
sonal beauty. It is to this circumstance, and to the very little exer-
cise taken on foot or on horseback in the open air here, that I attribute
the early corpulency and cadaverous appearance of some of our most
fashionable ladies. Many of the native white girls here are very
pretty. They are well formed; they are lively and affectionate; their


pagne dinners, and evening parties; whereas, the poor unfortunate
captain who had no vote or discretionary power in the choice of agents
for his ship—she having heen consigned by the London owners to the
firm —is left unnoticed, to eat his salt junk dinner week after week on

the early corpulency and cadaverous appearance of some of our most
fashionable ladies. Many of the native white girls here are very
pretty. They are well formed; they are lively and affectionate; their


complexion is beautiful; and their features are regular and pleasing.
Some of these personal attractions are no doubt owing to our delicious
climate, and the freedom or exemption which females in this colony
enjoy from all care about the future; for, I believe, the only subject
which at any time distracts their thoughts is what ought to be the
colour of the next gown; but no personal female attractions, however
great, can long remain scathless against beefsteaks at breakfast, cold
beef at noon lunch, roast and boiled beef at dinner, and cold beef at
tea or supper; this is perfectly outrageous! In the halcyon days of
the Roman empire it was, “ Jovis omnia plena” but alas! in our days
it is “ bovis omnia plena” as the rotundity and general appearance of
many ladies may testify. By thus increasing their bulk they evi-
dently spoil their own market; for I believe most men act agreeably
to the wise adage, that “ of all evils we ought to choose the least.”
The streets of Sydney, which are under the management of a cor-
poration chosen by the inhabitants, are lighted with gas, and are
paraded by a number of policemen during the night. You may walk
in perfect safety on a dark night through the city. In my opinion, a
foot passenger is in greater danger, after dusk, in many parts of Lon-
don, than he is in walking the streets of Sydney.
In the Supreme Court, the Courts of Requests, and Quarter Ses-
sions, and also in our Police Courts, justice is, I fully believe, as
purely and as conscientiously administered as in the corresponding
courts in either England or Scotland. And wo have here, that greatest
of all civil privileges—trial by jury. All our courts are open to the
newspaper reporters ; and the free and fearless discussions on men and
measures which daily issue from the public press, have a powerful in-
fluence in preserving the administration of law and justice free from
every suspicion of bribery and corruption. In the Court of Requests,
which is a court of conscience or equity, all cases not exceeding £3O
may be decided. This wise arrangement saves to the colonists large
sums of money which would otherwise be spent in useless litigation.
Our Sydney Post-office is well conducted; and through the inde-
fatigable exertions of Mr. Raymond, our Postmaster-General, post-
offices have been established in every little town or village throughout
the interior of the colony.
The exports of New South Wales are wool, beef, tallow, hides,
horns, horses, mutton-hams, oil, whalebone, tobacco, timber, mimosa
bark, canary-seed, and a variety of minor articles.
It is not generally known that gum arable, so extensively used in
the arts in England, might be collected here in large quantities. The


complexion is beautiful; and their features are regular and pleasing.

It is not generally known that gum arable, so extensively used in
the arts in England, might be collected here in large quantities. The


indigo plant is indigenous in the colony. The castor oil bush, or
shrub, covered with berries, is at this moment neglected as valueless
in the vicinity of Sydney. The rearing of the silkworm is attended
with very little trouble. I have seen some beautiful specimens of
thread spun here by these creatures. We have soap, salt, and two or
three woollen or cloth manufactories. Except my shirt, which is
English, I wear nothing but colonial] manufacture, —Mr. _Lord’s
colonial tweed, Mr. Ether’s colonial hats, and Mr. Wiltshire's colonial
tanned leather converted here into boots. I use nothing but Mr.
Blaxland’s colonial salt, Professor Eennie’s beautiful colonial soap,
and Mr. King’s colonial earthenware dishes. I forbear to mention
our colonial lucifer matches, as these are manufactured chiefly by the
clergy at the altar; but they are really good, and never miss fire at
the slightest touch, as some fathers of families acknowledge.
Our coal mines are numerous, of large extent, and at no great dis-
tance from the surface. The existence of iron mines has been clearly
ascertained ; but at the present stage of the colony, and taking into
account the scarcity of labour here, it is cheaper for us to import iron
from England than to dig for it. It has been, therefore, considered
advisable to let these mines remain for a time as a sinking fund for
the colony. The exceedingly fine sand, containing a large proportion
of silex, about Port Jackson, has been found by experiment to be ex-
tremely well adapted for the manufacture of glass. The splendid
copper mines which the people of South Australia are now working,
as well as the manganese and copper mines, which the colonists of
New Zealand have been working for some time past, will contribute
to stimulate the commercial intercourse between these young colonies
and New South Wales.
According to the steady rate of increase of our staple commodity—
wool, the clip of 1845, or quantity of wool to be shipped at the close
of this current year from Sydney and Port Phillip, will amount to
upwards of thirteen millions of pounds weight; and allowing 250
lbs. to a bale, there will be 52,000 bales. 1000 bales have been the
average quantity of wool hitherto shipped on board each of the Lon-
don or Liverpool vessels, which generally take oil, or some other
heavy export as ballast, under the wool. From this statement it will
be seen that no fewer than fifty-two ships will be required to carry
our wool-clip of 1845 to England. These thirteen million pounds of
wool, at the current Sydney price (Is. 3d. per lb.), will produce the
sum of £812,500, a very large amount for one article alone of export
from so young a colony!

Last year (1844) there have been only 2944 bales shipped from
Sydney for Liverpool; the remainder was for London. In 1831 the
total quantity of wool exported from this colony was only 5590 bales.
Last year, two large ships, the Herald , and General Hewett , carried to
London 5593 bales, being a little more than the total quantity exported
from Sydney in 1831; while in 1844, no fewer than forty ships were
loaded in Sydney harbour, chiefly with wool. This is a wonderful
change since 1802, when the total quantity of wool exported was only
245 lbs.
For fineness, silkiness, elasticity, and strength, Australian wool
has been pronounced by the best judges to be equal to any Spanish or
Saxon wool ever imported into England. And one great inducement
to a capitalist to invest his money in sheep here is, that our climate
improves our wool. Every year, without the intermixture of any
cross breed, our wool becomes finer. This has been found to be the
uniform effect produced by the climate of Australia on both imported
and colonial-bred sheep. Coarse-woolled sheep imported into this
colony have, in the course of years, gradually improved, until at last
the fleece was totally different from what the animal carried when
imported.
The value, as entered in the return of exports of sperm and black
whale oil, and of whalebone and seal skins exported from this colony
in 1840, was £224,144. I find, however, on reference to the Custom-
house returns, that since this date (1840), there has been a gradual
decrease in the quantity exported; this is accounted for by the quan-
tity sent from New Zealand direct, which was formerly sent to Sydney
for shipment.

ELIGIBILITY AND ADVANTAGES OF AUSTRALIA.
In pointing out some of the advantages of Australia as a field for
emigration, I shall take it for granted, without stopping to prove,
that there is now a large surplus population in Great Britain and
Ireland; that some of them find it difficult to procure a sufficiency of

who have either some trade or a limited capital, have plenty of food
and clothing for present use, and also in prospect, but yet see no

ELIGIBILITY AND ADVANTAGES OF AUSTRALIA.
In pointing out some of the advantages of Australia as a field for
emigration, I shall take it for granted, without stopping to prove,
that there is now a large surplus population in Great Britain and
Ireland; that some of them find it difficult to procure a sufficiency of
food and clothing for themselves and families; while others of them,
who have either some trade or a limited capital, have plenty of food
and clothing for present use, and also in prospect, but yet see no


reasonable chance of improving their present position, or of rising in
the world. These are my postulates.
As a field for emigration, the only countries between which and
the Australian colonies a comparison can be instituted by intending
emigrants from Great Britain and Ireland, are the United States,
British America, and New Zealand. Let us now briefly and dispas-
sionately examine the pretensions of each of these countries, and
compare them with those of Australia. It must be admitted, that the
United States of America possess advantages which nature has denied
to Australia. Throughout the interior of the United States, there are
large navigable rivers, affording water communication for the convey-
ance of the settlers’ produce, at a trifling expense, to distant markets.
Here we have but very few, if any, such rivers. In the United
States you can buy land equal at least to any in Australia at about
one dollar (4s. 6d.) an acre; whereas here, the minimum government
price is 20s. an acre. Within a fortnight you may now pass from
England, Ireland, or Scotland, into the United States, or British
America; and, if you repent of the exchange of country you have
made, you can easily go back again; whereas, it takes you four
months’ voyage to reach the nearest of the Australian colonies; and
if, on arrival, you should repent of the step you have taken, it will
then be too late. It requires a large amount of money —70/. or 80/. at
least —to enable even a single man to return from here to England as
a cabin passenger; and, in the case of the steerage passengers, though
the government give them a free passage out, no provision whatever
is made for affording them the means of returning home, in the event
of their repenting of their bargain on arrival in Australia. .Again, of
New Zealand it may safely be affirmed that the climate and soil are
good, that the temperature approximates to that of England, thus
holding out a strong inducement to English emigrants; that it is well
watered; that the crops seldom fail; and that the convict curse has
never been entailed upon it as on Australia, by the British Parliament.
I believe I have now candidly stated the gist of the arguments
which I conceive to be in favour of the United States, British
America, and New Zealand. Let us now see—not what can be urged
against them , for that forms no part of my present task, but what can
be said for Australia as a superior field for emigration.
In Australia we have neither the ague nor the yellow fever, which
cut off thousands in the United States. In Australia, Jonathan’s
truck system is unknown. If in Australia we have convicts, the
Yankees have worse—they have slaves. We only employ as servants,

for a limited number of years, men and women who have forfeited
their liberty to the violated laws of their country, whereas the
Yankees, who boast of their free institutions —their civil and political
liberties —are, as Lord Aberdeen truly told them, the only nation in
Christendom who enjoy the unenviable privilege and notoriety of
supporting slavery. If we employ convicts, we never yet, like
Jonathan, have had any traffic in human blood; such a foul blot has
never yet stained the Australian escutcheon. Twice already has
England been embroiled in war with the Yankees, and it is possible
that she may yet find it necessary to take up arms against them. The
annexation of Texas, and the proposed occupation of the Oregon
territory, form two very important subjects, which are not yet fully
settled, and which are likely enough to create a rupture between
England and the United States of America. In such a ease, the
emigrant from Great Britain or Ireland, placed on the field of battle
in a line opposite to his own brother or nearest relations, would feel
it a painful struggle to determine how to act inclination and
reviving attachment to native land, to kindred and ancient home,
disposing him to espouse the cause of England; while stem duty and
his oath of allegiance required that he should now contribute all in
his power to humiliate and crush the land to which he owed his birth
an alternative to which, I am confident, no Englishman of spirit or
right feeling would wish to be reduced. You ought also to remember,
that in spite of the extensive commercial intercourse between England
and the United States, the Yankees do still entertain a deep-rooted
antipathy against England and Englishmen, and that you, as emi-
grants, would be exposed to your full share of all the manifestations
of this international grudge; whereas, in Australia, you are only
among your own countrymen, who feel a pride and an interest in all
the glory and prosperity of England.
In British America, again, the inhabitants are, during a great pro-
portion, amounting to nearly one-half, of the whole year, locked up in
snow. Their long winters suspend all agricultural operations and
out-of-door labour. Many a tradesman, as well as common labourer,
is then thrown idle, and obliged to support himself and family by
falling back on his past savings, if he has been able to make any such
provision against what is vulgarly called a rainy day. If not, he and
his family must live on hope; whereas here, where we have no
winter, the poor man’s labour, which is his capital, is always avail-
able. Here neither the out-door nor the in-door tradesman suffers any

ment or occupation. Instead, therefore, of your haying, as in the
Canadas and Nova Scotia, only one part of the year to work at your
out-door trade, you have in Australia the whole year, and the daily
wages here are fully as high as in America, and moreover are paid in
money. In America there is only one sowing time, and only one crop
in the year; whereas, in Australia, we have two seed-times and two
harvests in the same year; and, if one crop fails, sow another: you lose
but little time. If as an agriculturist you arrive in America after
seed-time, you lose a whole year; whereas in Australia, come when
you may, you can lose no more than half a year. To this advantage
add the delightfulness of the Australian climate; for here we have
neither the swamps of Canada, the fogs of Nova Scotia, nor the fever
of New York. There is every reason to fear that the turbulent spirit
recently manifested in acts of open insurrection in Canada is not yet
extinguished. The French Canadians, who are by inheritance so
very excitable, require nothing but an able leader; and then there is
quite at hand M. Papineau who, instead of having been hanged, as
assuredly he deserved, has been appointed (if I am not misinformed)
to the high and responsible situation of her Majesty’s Attorney-Gene-
ral for the United Canadas !
The voyage from England to Australia, though much longer, is
actually safer than from England to America; and the difference in
the length of the voyage is, in my opinion, a matter of very little
consequence. Once you get yourself, your boxes, and your books, on
board the ship in which you have taken your passage, give yourself
no further concern about her. Leave it to the captain and- sailors to
manage the rest. You sit to read, until you hear that the Sydney
light-house is visible, or the anchor is let go in Port Jackson. I can
assure you that, for my own part, I was sorry when I was interrupted
in my studies by the termination of upwards of five months’ voyage.
It is good for a man to be occasionally shut out from the busy world,
and compelled, as it were, to hold communion with himself—thus
affording him all the advantages without the austerities of the
monkish life.
As to New Zealand, Europeans there find the natives a very dif-
ferent race of people from the aborigines of Australia. The natives of
New Zealand, who are naturally brave, muscular, and intelligent
people, and who have abundance of fire-arms and ammunition, are at
this moment up in arms against the settlers. These natives, who can
muster, in case of necessity, upwards of twenty thousand armed men,


occasions a suspension of the tradesman and labourer’s usual employ-
ment or occupation. Instead, therefore, of your haying, as in the
Canadas and Nova Scotia, only one part of the year to work at your
out-door trade, you have in Australia the whole year, and the daily

people, and who have abundance of fire-arms and ammunition, are at
this moment up in arms against the settlers. These natives, who can
muster, in case of necessity, upwards of twenty thousand armed men,


have very recently avowed their hostility to the white intruders, by
insulting and pulling down the British flag at the “ Bay of Islands.”
On this occasion, as well as on others, the present Governor, who may
be an amiable and well-meaning man, has proved himself to be totally
unfit to command in New Zealand. Through his imbecility and want
of decision, England has been thus insulted by semi-barbarians with
impunity. I here forbear to give any further specimens of the wis-
dom displayed in this government,—such as the recent entire aboli-
lition of the customs, and, in the very teeth of an act of parliament,
the reduction of the price of land in New Zealand, from one pound to
one penny sterling an acre, in order to please the natives! After
this suicidal act, who will be surprised at Donald’s politeness in sub-
mitting to be hanged in order to please the laird ?
Considering our proximity to New Zealand, we, who have an
interest in New South "Wales, have a right to complain of this instance
of misgovernment which contributes to demoralize still more our popu-
lation by opening a door for defrauding our revenue through smuggling.
A strong detachment of soldiers from Sydney are now on their
way to New Zealand, for the purpose of preserving peace, and secur-
ing obedience to the constituted authorities, —but the aborigines know
their own power and resources; and the maintenance of a strong
British force, kept up at a great expense there, will always be neces-
sary to protect the settlers against aggression. There is every reason
to fear that these natives will long continue to be a thorn in the side
of the European settlers, for it is presumed that England will never
be guilty of such unchristian and dishonourable conduct as to sanction
a war of extermination against a people to whom she first granted a
flag, and then, without provocation, or any just cause shown, invaded
and subjugated their country. From New Zealand look now at Aus-
tralia. The aborigines here, who have never been distinguished for
their warlike disposition, are completely subdued. They seldom give
us any trouble. They have no fire-arms, and the fear of the white
man has evictently seized on them. A few months ago a party of
seventy or eighty of them, armed with spears, boomerangs, &c., came
to my head station, where their dogs attacked my cattle. There were
only four white men, including myself, on the place. We took our
guns, turned out and fired a few blank shots in the direction of the
dogs. The whole tribe of blacks, dogs and all, decamped, crossed the
river, and in five minutes from the first firing, not one of them was to
be seen. A whole regiment of English cavalry could not thus
frighten the New Zealanders.

If our soil, taken as a whole, is inferior to that of any of the three
countries above named, it must be remembered that Australia is emi-
nently a pastoral , not an agricultural country. The signs of our
zodiac are Aries and Taurus, though these are in the northern, and we
in the southern hemisphere. We trust more to wool, beef, and tal-
low, than to wheat; and yet, as I have already shown, we have here
extensive tracts of very fertile soil, producing in some cases thirty,
some sixty, and in some one hundred fold. An English farmer
having first looked at our wretched system of agriculture, and then at
our splendid crops, would he greatly surprised, especially if he took
into consideration that the land which yielded this return had never
been artificially manured, and that it had already produced ten or
twelve crops of wheat in succession, the land during that long period
not having enjoyed the rest or the relief afforded by a rotation of
crops. Our soil produces all the grains and fruits of Europe. In
Australia we have innumerable plains, such as Bathurst, O’Connell,
Goulburn, and Yass plains, each of them measuring many thousands
of acres, all covered with the richest pasture, with scarcely a single
tree, and all ready for the plough. If we have not navigable rivers
like America, neither is land-carriage for our staple commodity, wool,
at all expensive—from 200/. to 300/. worth of wool being often carried
to market on one dray. To the prosperity of a pastoral country,
navigable rivers, however desirable, are not essential. These were
intended by nature only for agricultural and commercial countries :
yet it is not the fact that we have no navigable rivers whatever.
The river Hawkesbury admits of vessels of 100 tons going up to
Windsor. Steamers go almost daily up the Hunter River-to Mait-
land. The Paterson and William’s Rivers are navigable to small
craft. The Clarence River is navigable for many miles ; and doubt-
less, at no distant period, a regular communication by water will he
established between South Australia and the thousands of settlers that
people the rich valleys along the banks of the rivers Hume and Mur-
rimbidgee. In this case we shall boil our fat bullocks and sheep
where they now graze, and thus save the tallow now lost in driving
them to Sydney or Melbourne. Our wool, tallow, beef, hides, mut-
ton-hams, mimosa bark, gum, cordage made from the bark of trees, &c.,
will then be sent down by water at a trifling expense all the way to
P ort Adelaide. There is nothing impracticable in the undertaking
now suggested. The rivers just mentioned are sufficiently deep, and
not rapid. Nothing is to be feared from the natives on the hanks.

Captain Sturt went down the Murrimbidgee and Murray Rivers in


his boat, all the way to Lake Alexandria ; and it is well-known that
there are no water-falls in the Murray, or in either of the two great
rivers, the Hume and Murrimbidgee—the junction of which forms the
Murray—to present any impediment to the proposed navigation. To
remove the numerous logs, or snags, as the Yankees call them, which
have been for ages accumulating in various parts of the channels of
those rivers, would doubtless be attended with expense; but the
increase in the value of the land on the banks of the rivers thus ren-
dered navigable, would more than repay to the government any
necessary outlay: and under proper management, a great part of this
public work might be performed by the blacks who line the banks of
those rivers. These people are naturally fitted for such employment,
and to keep them to it would be the most effectual way of civilising
them.
In Australia we have no national debt to absorb our profits. Here
we have no direct taxes, as in England, to keep the people’s noses
always to the grindstone; here we have neither tithes, nor poor-rates,
nor game-laws, nor severe winter. In Australia we have no exclusive
religion, no dominant state church. We have no quadrupeds danger-
ous to man. We have here the same laws, the same money, the same
coins as in England. We enjoy the most delightful climate on the
face of the globe; and, thanks to the liberality of England, our mili-
tary force is paid by John Bull. The soldiers who protect our lives
and property, and who consume our beef and mutton, are paid, fed,
and clothed at the expense of the British nation.
It is not to be denied that we still want good roads—-a want which
is common to all new colonies; but, owing to the mildness of our
winter, and the general uniformity of our climate, our hush, or natural
roads, are such as to occasion very little inconvenience to the settlers.
In proof of this, I may mention that parties have driven in their gigs
all the way across from Adelaide to Port Philip, a distance of 500
miles; and I myself have driven tandem, a few years ago, in the dead
of winter, from Sydney to beyond the Hume River, a distance of 420
miles.
In Australia we have boundless extent of territory, and no winter
food is required to be provided for the sustentation of live stock. In
America the number of graminivorous animals, such as sheep, cattle,
and horses, which the inhabitants can rear, must always be limited
by the quantity of food they are able to provide for them against the
winter. It is not so in Australia. Here there needs be no limit to
the number of your flocks aud herds, even if you should not have an

America the number of graminivorous animals, such as sheep, cattle,
and horses, which the inhabitants can rear, must always be limited
by the quantity of food they are able to provide for them against the

the number of your flocks aud herds, even if you should not have an


inch of land you could call your own. Many live in Sydney, some
occupying situations, and others idle, whose flocks and herds are
increasing beyond the boundaries of location; for, according to an
Act of Council passed in 1839, any person of good character, on pay-
ment of £lO, may obtain a government license for occupying crown
lands beyond the boundaries of the colony. As abundance of the
most nutritious grass is thus to be had for almost nothing, at all times
of the year , there is no limit to the extent to which the Australian
stockholder’s flocks and herds may be allowed to increase. This pecu-
liar circumstance partly accounts for the large and rapid fortunes
made by many persons who arrived in this colony friendless and penni-
less.
In a former chapter I have stated, that in addition to the £lO (for
a yearly license) required to be paid by the squatter to the colonial
treasury, there is a half-yearly assessment levied on the stock, accord-
ing to the following rate :— Sheep, |d., horned cattle, l|d., and horses
3d. a-head ; and Sir George Gipps, the present governor, talks of
making every twenty square miles, or 12,800 acres, occupied by the
squatter, pay £lO a-ycar. After the determined opposition made by
the colonists, it is not probable that this proposed regulation will be
enforced; but, even if it should, I see no reason to apprehend from its
enforcement the disastrous consequences to the squatters which some
croakers anticipate. Even still we shall be able to undersell in the
London market the wool-growers of Spain, Saxony, and other places,
where the flockowners have to construct warm sheds for their sheep,
and to provide them with hay for their winter food. Hear what the
report of the Rural Society Company at Naz (near Geneva, in Switzer-
land) states ;—“The sheep proprietors calculate on at least 150 days
of dry stall-feed yearly. Their sheep are then fed on hay. Wet ewes
get each of them 2| lbs. of hay daily. Dry ewes, wethers, and rams,
get about 2 lbs. daily. They are fed twice a-day, and also twice a-
day the sheep are driven out to a spring of running water.”
Contrast now the expense and trouble attending the management
of sheep at Naz with our Australian mode of management, and then
say whether we have any just cause eventually to fear competition
from foreigners in the London wool market.
Look again at our geographical position. Glance at a chart of the
world, and see how very conveniently situated Australia is for trade
and commerce. With a sea-coast of nearly eight thousand miles, all
indented at regular intervals with a vast number of safe, large, and
commodious harbours, partly in the torrid zone, and partly in the


inch of land you could call your own. Many live in Sydney, some
occupying situations, and others idle, whose flocks and herds are
increasing beyond the boundaries of location; for, according to an

and commerce. With a sea-coast of nearly eight thousand miles, all
indented at regular intervals with a vast number of safe, large, and
commodious harbours, partly in the torrid zone, and partly in the


temperate gone, Australia is in the very centre of the busy world.
In Java, the Mauritius, and the Phillipine Islands, our sugar is manu-
factured ; China produces our tea and silk; in India our rice is raised;
in Ceylon our coffee. And these islands and countries, in return, will
find it their interest to open a market for the sale of some of our sur-
plus productions. We are no great distance (only about a month’s
sail) from the western coast of America; and all the islands of the
Pacific, as well as those of the Indian Archipelago, will be so many
convenient market-places for Australian produce.
In attempting to point out the advantages of Australia, I forbear
to notice the fortunes that have been made here by buying and re-
selling town or building allotments. Half-acre allotments bought at
Melbourne, in 1837, at £5O, were sold in the following year at £2OOO.
As these are nothing better than gambling speculations, no prudent
man will countenance them. It is far better to play a sure, though
slow game, than risk your money and peace of mind on the wheel of
capricious fortune. Neither would I advise the emigrant of capital
to invest his money in colonial hank shares, in insurance or steam
navigation companies. Within the last two or three years, heavy
losses have been sustained by numerous parties here, through the
incapacity, negligence, or dishonesty of the men to whom the share-
holders intrusted the management of their money. I believe, how-
ever, that those two banks, the “ Union Bank of Australia ” and the
“ Bank of Australasia,” the head offices of which are in London, are
perfectly safe, and that a man would incur hut very little risk in pur-
chasing shares in either of them.
For the benefit of the poorer classes, we have a Sydney Savings’
Bank, which is, and has for many years been under the able manage-
ment of a Mr. George Miller, an honest and clear-headed Scotchman.
Deposits, from a few shillings up to £2OO, are received there, and
interest at the rate of 5 per cent, is paid yearly to the depositor on any
balance standing to his credit; on 30th June, 1843, the number of
depositors was 2590, and the amount to their credit was £86,732 13s. 9d.
In England, Ireland, and Scotland, there are many honest and
industrious tradesmen, who are scarcely able to keep free from debt.
It is not so here. There is no man who is able and willing to work
that needs be poor, or without having money in the Savings’ Bank in
Sydney. If a man, who is in the enjoyment of good health, is here
in destitute circumstances, it may in general he affirmed that he is
either indolent or profligate. The man who has no property has pro-
bably a trade, or, if he has no trade, he has a pair of hands to work,

or a pair of legs to carry him at the rate of a mile an hour after a
flock of sheep.
In letters received from England, I have been often asked the
question, Who are those who ought to emigrate to Australia ? In
answering this question, I shall begin by describing those who ought
not to emigrate. Several young men of dissipated habits have been
sent out here by their friends to reform ! They were scapegoats at
home, and were likely to entail disgrace upon their families; it was
therefore judged prudent to get rid of them by sending them to a very
distant country, whence they could not readily return. If the inten-
tion of their parents or friends was utterly to ruin them, and thus
blot out their memories for ever, no better plan could have been
adopted ; but if the intention was to reform those hopeful youngsters,
it was the most absurd idea that ever entered the brain of man. Send
a youngster to Botany Bay to be reformed! It is perfectly ludicrous;
it is cruel mockery. They could not have sent them to a more un-
favourable place for reformation. It requires not the gift of prophecy
to foretell what must be the influence of bad example, in a convict
colony, on a young man of loose morals, and far removed from parental
restraint. His career would be rapidly downward—his doom fixed—
and here is no compassion felt for him. The finical dandy who trusts
for success to the high-sounding names of some of his family connec-
tions, or to his own dashing appearance, will find himself greatly
disappointed. The people of this colony care not one straw about the
emigrant’s rank or titles. Neither is this the field for the display of
great literary talents. The colony is yet too young either to appreci-
ate or reward such intellectual luxuries; and therefore the penniless
scholar has but a very slender chance of success here. Owing to the
scattered state of the population, there are but few inducements to
professional men, such as clergymen, lawyers, medical men, teachers,
and artists, to emigrate. Having thus stated the description of people
we do not want in Australia, I will now mention those we do want,
and whom the colony will abundantly reward for their work; they
are the industrious, the sober, and the healthy of the following
classes Shepherds, ploughmen, carters, labourers, gardeners, cooks,
grooms, butchers, bakers, printers, millers, sawyers, brick-makers
stone-cutters, masons, saddle and harness-makers, carpenters, cabinet-
makers, plasterers, painters and glaziers, blacksmiths, wheelwrights,
tailors, shoemakers, tanners and curriers, female house - servants
nurses, farmers, retired officers, and other gentlemen, with either
small or large capital.

In letters received from England, I have been often asked the
question, Who are those who ought to emigrate to Australia ? In
answering this question, I shall begin by describing those who ought
not to emigrate. Several young men of dissipated habits have been
sent out here by their friends to reform ! They were scapegoats at
home, and were likely to entail disgrace upon their families; it was
therefore judged prudent to get rid of them by sending them to a very
distant country, whence they could not readily return. If the inten-

blot out their memories for ever, no better plan could have been

it was the most absurd idea that ever entered the brain of man. Send
a youngster to Botany Bay to be reformed! It is perfectly ludicrous;

favourable place for reformation. It requires not the gift of prophecy
to foretell what must be the influence of bad example, in a convict
colony, on a young man of loose morals, and far removed from parental
restraint. His career would be rapidly downward—his doom fixed—

are the industrious, the sober, and the healthy of the following

These are Jhe people who ought to emigrate to Australia, and to
these our colony offers advantages which are not to be met with in
any other part of the world. In the United States, in British America,
and some other countries, wages may, perhaps, be as high as here ;
but where is the country in which any sum of money, however sftiall,
which a man saves out of his wages, can be laid out so advantageously
as in Australia ? Where is the other country whose inhabitants pos-
sess so large a proportion of food as the colonists of Australia ? And
be it remembered, that the extent of our rich pastures is illimitable ;
and, there being no winter here, our flocks and herds may increase
indefinitely—thus constantly multiplying food and employment for all
that can possibly emigrate. Here are not only room enough and food
enough, but remunerative labour enough, and to spare ; while many
of the labouring classes of England, Ireland, and Scotland are half
starving with hunger. Here is freedom from all fear of want. At
home —I mean where you now reside—you are often afraid of being
thrown out of employment. No such fear ever disturbs your repose
in Australia; and the more numerous your family is, the greater is
your chance of success. To each of them you may, in a few years,
have it in your power, by ordinary prudence and industry, to leave
landed property yielding sufficient produce to place them and their
posterity for ever beyond the fear of want. And surely, you parents,
who are naturally concerned for the future welfare of your children,
will not hesitate to make some personal sacrifice on your part —to run
some slight risk—in order permanently to provide for their comfort.
The whole land is here before you ; and if your own country has denied
you sufficient food or remunerative labour, the voice of Providence
which was addressed to Abram is now addressed to each of you, say-
ing, “ Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from
thy father’s house, into a land that I will show thee.” Labour is,
perhaps, the only capital which many of you possess ; but in exchange
for this capital, for which you sometimes receive but a scanty allowance
at home, we will give you here abundance of the most substantial
food for yourselves and families. To be a shepherd here, it is not at
all necessary that a man should have previously served an apprentice-
ship to this sort of employment. Some of our best shepherds in
Australia have been Paisley weavers. One of my hut-keepers, a man
who has been now some years in my employment, is an old sailor from
Hull; and one of my present stockmen was a labourer in England.
Any man who is able and willing to work may here obtain remunera-
tive employment. Ido not know any sober industrious freeman, of

Numbers of both naval and military officers are scattered over the
interior, acting as magistrates, or living on their own purchased

importance, by emigrating to this colony, where they would have
nothing to buy except their clothing, tea and sugar, soap and salt.

kill their owh game.
In so limited a work as this, it is impossible to enumerate all the
advantages which Australia holds out to intending emigrants ; but I
trust that what I have already stated will sufficiently show, that if
this is not a land flowing with milk and honey, it is at least a land
capable of yielding abundance of both animal and vegetable food for
all the surplus population of Great Britain and Ireland.
CHAPTER XIII.
TRAVELLING IN THE BUSH.
As I wish to introduce you to the blacks of this country, you and
I shall now make an excursion into the interior; and as a preparation
for this journey, each of us must provide himself with the following
equipment:—A good horse, a pair of hobbles, a tin pot for boiling tea,
blanket, greatcoat, tinder-box, pocket-compass, and saddle-bags, con-
taining a couple of regatta-shirts, two or three pairs of cotton socks, a
blank cheque-book, and some negrohead tobacco. The blank cheque-
book must be one of those which will do for any bank.
While we are travelling within the region of civilization, we pay
our expenses at the inns on the road by cheques on the banks in which
we keep our deposits. It is very seldom an innkeeper refuses as pay-
ment of his bill the cheque of any respectable-looking man, whether
known or unknown. Mr. Boniface is thus sometimes duped , yet he
knows well the difficulty and danger of carrying money on the road ;
and that, were ho to refuse cheques in payment of his bills, he would
soon lose half his customers, who would in that case be obliged to
“ bush it ” every night. It sometimes happens that when bush-rangers
stop a traveller, and rummage his packet and saddle-bags, they com-
pel him to sign and give them a bank cheque, made payable to bearer
on demand. Yet in this case the traveller generally defeats them.
He either gives the cheque on a bank in which he has no money (and
payment is consequently refused), or he signs his name so differently
from his usual way, that on the cheque being presented for payment
at the bank, where his genuine signature has been left, it is pronounced
a forgery, and the unfortunate bush-ranger runs a fair chance of being
immediately apprehended.

Money is scarcely in use in the interior. Nearly all the business
is done by cheques or orders on some Sydney or Melbourne bank or
merchant. These cheques and orders pass through scores of hands.
A £lO cheque, which I gave in May, was not presented to the bank
till October. Another cheque which I gave was nearly eighteen
months in circulation ; and, by the time it reached the bank, the back
of it was covered with indorsements, indicating only a few of the
hands through which it passed. The banks are very accommodating
in this respect. Though they generally grumble when any order or
cheque for less thau twenty shillings is presented to them for payment,
yet I have known them to pay a cheque amounting to only a few
shillings.
After we shall have passed the region of civilization, the common
circulating medium, among both whites and blacks, is tobacco —negro-
head tobacco. Neither David Ricardo nor Adam Smith, nor indeed
any other great political economist that I know, has ever discussed
the merits of negrohead tobacco as a standard of value. So far as I
know, the only celebrated writer on this subject is the African travel-
ler, Mungo Park, who states that “ twenty leaves of tobacco were
considered on the Niger as a bar of tobacco, which bar the whites
valued at 2s. sterling; and that thus a slave, whose price was then
about £l5, was said to be worth 150 bars of tobacco.” Not having a
copy of “ Mungo Park’s Travels ” at hand, I make this quotation, like
some others, from memory. I can therefore vouch, not for the exact
words, but the general substance or purport of the extracts thus
quoted. For tobacco you get anything done for you in the bush.
There everybody smokes: men, women, and children, white and
black, all smoke. Every dinner, every supper, every meeting here
ends in smoke. About two years ago, it was seriously apprehended
that the whole colony was then about to end in smoke. When they
are out of tobacco, the people will smoke anything and everything,
tea-leaves, &c.; they have been known even to smoko a passing
stranger, who appeared to have some designs on them! I need not
say more to prove that tobacco procures for you a cordial reception,
and the best recommodation at every hut you pass on your travels.
While we are travelling among civilized people, that is, within the
boundaries of location, we generally move, or, as the newly-applied
term is, progress at the rate of five or six miles an hour; and forty
miles are considered a good day’s work, especially when we have a
long journey before us. As in travelling here everything depends
upon your attention to your horse, allow me to give you a few prac-

term is, progress at the rate of five or six miles an hour; and forty
miles are considered a good day’s work, especially when we have a
long journey before us. As in travelling here everything depends
upon your attention to your horse, allow me to give you a few prac-


tical hints on this very important subject. Feed him, not as much,
but as often'b s you can ; for, though learned jockeys have laid it down
as a rule that “ for a saddle-horse to go well he should be two parts
blood,” they have left it for you to infer that the remaining part or
parts should be made up of corn and hay, &c. And let me advise you
always to see your own horse eat his food. At the inns here I have
invariably made it a point of duty to comb my horse’s tail or mane
while he is eating his corn. I find that he thus thrives as fast again
on it. This is an extraordinary fact, and to me perfectly unaccount-
able. No writer on animal physiology has hitherto even attempted an
explanation of this phenomenon ; the celebrated Mr. Pickwick him-
self, who has done so much for the cause of science, has not ventured
to look at this difficulty. It would, therefore, be presumption in me
to try to explain it. I merely state the fact, that your horse will
thrive as fast again, if you comb his tail every time he is eating his
corn in a Botany Bay public house stable. Water him a mile or two
before his journey’s end; and walk him gently after he has been
watered. Let the first and last parts of your day’s journey be per-
formed slowly. In the evening, wash his feet up to the knees. In
such a hot climate as this, the friction of his shoes is sufficient to
heat, not only his hoofs, but his feet. Let the saddle remain on his
back until he has cooled. The girths should of course be slackened
on his entering the stable. Rub him well while he is nibbling at his
hay ; but give him no com until he is quite cool. If the corn is not
cracked , mix either bran or chaff with it, otherwise he will gulp it
without chewing it. You ought also daily to mix a little salt, about
two ounces, with his feed. I sometimes carry in my pocket a small
quantity of nitre for my horse. At every stopping place take off the
saddle and dry it; the back of many a good horse has been injured
through the neglect of this precaution. Allow about half an hour to
elapse from the time that he has finished his corn until you proceed
on your journey. When you can get no corn, try to buy, beg, or
borrow some 11 siftings ” (bran), which are to be found at almost every
hut. By thus attending to your horse, he will always be in fair con-
dition ; and, by the long continuous journeys you perform, you will
surprise many a besotted traveller who is in the habit of drinking in
the tap-room until he is half blind, his poor horse being all this time
left to the tender mercies of the hostler—a character celebrated
throughout the world for honesty and humanity.
After we shall have travelled two or three hundred miles out of
Sydney, we may not always find it convenient so to regulate our


tical hints on this very important subject. Feed him, not as much,
but as often'b s you can ; for, though learned jockeys have laid it down
as a rule that “ for a saddle-horse to go well he should be two parts

borrow some 11 siftings ” (bran), which are to be found at almost every
hut. By thus attending to your horse, he will always be in fair con-
dition ; and, by the long continuous journeys you perform, you will
surprise many a besotted traveller who is in the habit of drinking in
the tap-room until he is half blind, his poor horse being all this time
left to the tender mercies of the hostler—a character celebrated
throughout the world for honesty and humanity.
After we shall have travelled two or three hundred miles out of
Sydney, we may not always find it convenient so to regulate our


journeys as to reach a public-house every evening; and, even if it
were convenient, I would not advise it, —for as we recede from Sydney
or Melbourne, the grass for our horses improves in the same ratio that
the accommodation for ourselves and them becomes worse. There-
fore we shall not trouble the publicans with our presence; and in
order to do without them, we buy, in passing a store on the road,
some tea and sugar. We can calculate on getting beef and damper at
every hut we pass. Thus provided, we may either stop at a hut, or
camp out wherever we find water; for grass and firewood are every-
where abundant. If we stop at a hut, we manage our horses as fol-
lows :—On our arrival, having taken off the saddles, we hobble the
horses at some distance from the hut, in sight of the inmates. And
then, after it gets dark, if we are not sure of the character of the men,
you keep them talking while I go out to remove our horses to a con-
siderable distance, and in a direction opposite to that in which we
first hobbled them. The object of this manoeuvre is to prevent their
being hid (or planted as it is here called) by any of the men about the
hut. To plant travellers’ horses and settlers’ working bullocks is a
common trick played by Botany Bay convicts, who will afterwards
offer to find them for a specified reward. The above is one way in
which you may defeat these artful villains.
In most cases I prefer to camp out and far away from any hut. It
is the most independent way of travelling. Towards evening, on our
arrival at good water, we hobble our horses, light a fire, and boil tea
in our tin quart pots. We carry our tea and sugar, cold beef, and
damper. After supper we generally visit our horses, and observe the
direction in which they are heading. We then make our beds as fol-
lows :—each of us selects for himself some soft, dry, and warm place,
on which he spreads his great-coat and blanket; between these two
he sleeps ; his saddle inverted serves for a pillow. If it rains, stick in
the ground, about six feet apart, two forks; place a ridge pole upon
them, and over it spread your blanket, the edges of which fasten to
the ground with wooden pegs. You have now a house, which will
be both dry and warm, and tenfold more comfortable than the tub of
Diogenes. At dawn you will be awakened by a bird called the
“Jackass,” which then sets up a long-continued horse-laugh. This
intimation he regularly gives every morning at dawn, then half an
hour afterwards, and finally when it is broad day-light; after which
you seldom hear anything more of the Jackass till next morning! By
their punctually crowing or laughing in a body every morning at
dawn, they are very useful in the bush. In summer the traveller is

their punctually crowing or laughing in a body every morning at
dawn, they are very useful in the bush. In summer the traveller is


often awakened in the morning by frogs, which give regular concerts
during the season. Having risen, the first thing we do is to look for
our horses, which are frequently in sight; but if not, we track them.
Having found them, we saddle them, start and travel ten or twelve
miles before we halt at some water, where we light a fire and break-
fast, while we allow them to feed near us. This is the usual mode of
travelling in the Australian bush. If it is moonlight, many gentle-
men prefer, especially in summer, travelling at night , and resting both
themselves and horses during the day-time. I recollect having been
once with a party thus travelling at night, when I was deputed by
the rest to call at a friend’s hut on the way, to borrow, not “ three
loaves,” but one damper, for our journey. It vividly brought into
my recollection the beautiful passage in St. Luke’s Gospel, chap. xi.
s —B; for, as every Greek scholar knows, this is the spirit of the pas-
sage as it stands in the original. The Greek passage clearly implies
that the midnight traveller turned out of his road to call on his friend,
not with the intention of remaining with him during the rest of the
night, but merely to borrow the three loaves, and then to proceed on
his journey, just as our party did after I borrowed the damper.
It may not, perhaps, be generally known, that in this colony we
have wild fig-trees. A young friend of mine, with whom I was tra-
velling in the month of December, proposed that we should turn off
our path to visit a fig-tree, which he had often seen, and which he
stated must have fruit, as he had lately seen it with leaves (which
generally appear after the fruit), and the time of figs, or fig-gathering,
was not yet arrived. On coming to it we found figs. Never till then
did I see the full force of that parable lecorded in Mark xi. 13, 14,
and the reason of the divine malediction there pronounced. When
sucking the leaves of trees, which I have more than once done, as I
travelled under a scorching heat, through a country at the time desti-
tute of water, how refreshing would I have found “ a cup of cold
water,” and how valuable the parcel of ground that would have in-
cluded the well which Jacob gifted to his favourite son Joseph! I
have here seen the exact counterpart of Rachel driving her father
Laban’s flocks at noon to be watered out of wells carefully shaded
over to prevent any loss or waste of water through evaporation in this
warm climate; and I have also seen my own bullock-drivers, like the
Israelites on leaving Egypt, carry on their journey kneading-troughs
with damper, which is just unleavened, that is, unfermented bread.
But I must here quit biblical exposition, and return to bush-travel-
ling. While I have been thinking of nothing but theology, you may

But I must here quit biblical exposition, and return to bush-travel-
ling. While I have been thinking of nothing but theology, you may


perhaps have been only wishing to know how we are to manage for
clean shirts, since each of us had only two spare ones at starting, and
we may be twice as many weeks on our journey. At any hut on our
way, in this very dry climate, the hut-keeper can wash and dry a
shirt for you between six o’clock evening and six o’clock next morn-
ing. On those roads which I often travel I sometimes, with a view
to relieve my horse, carry only one shirt, viz., that on my hack. But
then I have shirts left to be washed at different stages, which I no
sooner reach, than I put off the one I wear, and put on a clean one ;
the one which I now leave will be ready for me again on my return.
If in some other countries the people can boast of their relays of
horses, here we can boast of our relays of shirts.
If you wish to make your toilet, when camping far away from any
hut, you can go to a pond of clear water, and looking into it as into a
mirror, you can shave or admire yourself, like Ovid’s Narcissus, but
not, it is to he hoped, with the same fatal result. Some hushmen or
settlers shave only once a year.
In the months of August and September last, several of our creeks
and rivers continued for weeks to overflow their banks, and in the
absence of boats and bridges, present very serious obstacles to travel-
ling. A few persons, among whom were two of our postmen, lost
their lives in attempting to cross the creeks on the road. Last winter,
as I was returning from a distant station, riding one horse and lead-
ing another, on the back of which my opossum cloak, great coat, &c.,
were strapped, I came to one of those swelled creeks, which I crossed
in the following mannerln order to guard against the chance of
drowning my horses, I looked out for an easy and wide landing-place
on the opposite bank, and then, at a considerable distance above this
place, according to the strength and speed of the current—which may
bo determined by throwing a stick into the centre of it—l drove in my
horses, after having taken the following precaution, viz., tied the stir-
rups over their backs, and unbuckled the bridle-reins, to prevent the
chance of the animals getting their feet entangled, which would of
course impede their swimming, and probably be the means of drown-
ing them. I got over myself by means of fallen trees, partly im-
mersed, and extending the greater part of the way across. Where it
can be done, this is safer than risking yourself on a horse’s back,
especially in crossing these impetuous creeks, where horses are fre-
quently carried several rods down the stream. You can easily catch
your horse on the opposite side, as soon as you get over yourself.
Your blanket, great-coat, and shirts, which you sent across tied on


perhaps have been only wishing to know how we are to manage for

Your blanket, great-coat, and shirts, which you sent across tied on


the horse’s hack, will get dry before night; but you must contrive to
keep dry your tea and sugar, and tinder-box, by securing them on or
behind your bead; for they will not be safe tied on the horse’s
withers, as many horses swim on their sides, and some totally disap-
pear on the first plunge, and then, at the distance of a few yards, rise
above the surface. If you carry a tomahawk you may cut a sheet of
bark, on which you can cross dry and in perfect safety after your horses.
During the greater part of September and October last, when the floods
entered several of our houses in this district, not only travellers, but her
Majesty s mail, had been conveyed across the Hume river on a sheet of
bark, navigated by a naked black fellow. The river was then two miles
wide, which was too great a distance for any horse to swim.
As your tin quart pot may happen to he lost, or broken, or may
become leaky on your travels, it is as well for you to know how, in
the absence of any metallic vessel, you may be able to boil water for
your tea, &c. Everywhere throughout the Australian forest may be
seen sticking to the trees knobs of all sizes and shapes, and covered,
like the tree, of which they are tumours, with bark. With your
tomahawk or knife cut off the hemispherical or half globular bark of
one of these round knobs or elbows which you find to be nearly the
size of your head. When you have made a complete circular incision
in the direction of the brim of the intended vessel, the hark will easily
strip, after a few thumps to destroy the cohesive attraction between it
and the wood. The concave or inner side of this vessel is as clean
and smooth as a polished table, and in order to dry it and extract the
sap, let a gentle flame play against the inside of it for a few minutes.
Fill it now with water, and place it near your fire. Heat nearly to
redness a few clean and hard stones, which when thus heated seize by
means of two sticks, used by way of tongs, and immerse them one by
one for a few seconds in your bark tea-pot, which will now boil. The
thing required is done, as Euclid, on solving one of his beautiful pro-
blems, would express it. The water may thus be kept furiously boil-
ing for any length of time, and you may now enjoy your tea, and bo
perfectly independent of the whole race of tinkers, as well as of many
other descendants of Tubal-Cain, whom only our luxury, indolence,
and artificial wants supply with employment.
If you carry a gun on your travels, you may have it in your
power to shoot more game than half-a-dozen could eat. I myself,
however, dislike carrying a gun, or indeed any fire-arms on a journey;
for besides encumbering they render you more liable to attacks from
bushrangers, to whom fire-arms are always a valuable prize. As a

however, dislike carrying a gun, or indeed any fire-arms on a journey;
for besides encumbering they render you more liable to attacks from
bushrangers, to whom fire-arms are always a valuable prize. As a


means of defence from such attacks, fire-arms are perfectly useless to
the traveller. The bushrangers will have him covered with their
muskets from behind a bush or tree, before he can finger his trigger.
You may possibly infer from occasional statements in the news-
papers, that great numbers of travellers who go down from Jerusalem
to Jericho fall among our Botany Bay thieves, and that a man can
scarcely move out of Sydney without being attacked and robbed by
bushrangers. I beg to assure you that this is not the case. I have
travelled many thousands of miles in all directions, north, west, and
south, through this colony, during the last ten years, and I have never
yet been stopped by bushrangers. I have met them well-mounted
and armed, but they allowed me to pass unchallenged. They merely
asked me what parties I saw on the road I came and they were going.
These fellows generally know their mark; they know those who
usually carry money. Besides, the farther you go from Sydney the
less is your chance of meeting bushrangers, for the very obvious
reason that in the distant interior there is but little for which they care.
I have stated that a necessary part of your bush equipment is a
pocket compass. The most convenient sort is about the circumfer-
ence of a five-shilling piece, in a brass case. I need not remind you
that if held too close to your stirrup-irons or your tomahawk, the
magnetic needle may be disturbed. Unless you know the country
well, you must carefully guard against the chance of losing yourself
in the Australian forest. In the year 1791, that is, soon after the
formation of the colony, twenty male convicts and one female, each
taking a week’s provisions, and armed with tomahawks and knives,
absconded from near Sydney, with the intention of walking to China!
Some of these people, after lingering a long time, and living on roots
and wild berries, perished miserably.
In case you should happen to lose yourself, either give your horse
his head—he will probably take you back to whence you started in
the morning—or try to catch a view, from some lofty position, of the
forest, in all directions, and thence notice the general fall of the
country. In this depression there is most probably a creek, which in
this colony consists of a chain of stagnant ponds, receiving the water
from the surrounding elevations. Follow down this creek; for in nil
likelihood there are stations on it, or it will lead you to some river or
larger reservoir of water, near which you will certainly meet either
white or black inhabitants. Some new chums, to whom I once gave
this direction, told me afterwards that they found the creek by follow-
ing my advice, but that after finding it they could not ascertain which


means of defence from such attacks, fire-arms are perfectly useless to
the traveller. The bushrangers will have him covered with their
muskets from behind a bush or tree, before he can finger his trigger.

ing my advice, but that after finding it they could not ascertain which


was up or down, or towards what point of the compass the creek
when running would flow, so level was the valley through which it
passed. To determine this point is very easy. Almost all our creeks
run at one time or other of the year, and, while thus running, they
wash down a mass of rubbish, part of which is caught and held by
trees and logs in the channel of the creek. It is therefore evident
that the current, which had so far carried this rubbish, must have
come from that side of the tree or log against which the rubbish was left.
If neither of the plans which I have here suggested should get you
out of your difficulty, you must just hobble your horse light a fire, and
bush it for the night. If you have no food, you must try to imitate the
blacks, who have to catch or gather all their food. How they manage to
live you will see, if you take the trouble of reading the following chapter.

CHAPTER XIY.
NATIVE POPULATION.
Of the black natives of Australia there are several varieties, dif-
fering in language, customs, and general appearance, The following
remarks apply chiefly to those aborigines residing in the Murrumbid-
gee and Murray districts. In both height and weight these blacks
differ very little from the English; and in these two respects also the
males and females among the blacks hear the same proportion to each
other that the two sexes in England do to one another. But in many
other points the difference is very remarkable. The legs of the
blacks, especially of the females, are extremely thin and slender
they are perfect spindle-shanks ; the arms also of the females, which
are long, appear to he nothing hut skin and hone. The hands are
small. Among both sexes the foot approaches to club-shape, and the
toes are wide and turning inwards. From these two peculiarities I
can at once tell whether the impression of a human foot in the sand or
mud before me, be that of a white or a native. The head is generally
large, with a greater proportion behind than before the ears. The
forehead is long, narrow, and sloping backward. The skin is dark;
the hair is jet black, straight, long, and coarse, but neither curly nor
woolly ; the eyes are black and lively ; the face is broad, the mouth
large, the lips thick and prominent; the nose short, with its point
slightly turning upwards; the cheek-bones are high; the skull is so

mud before me, be that of a white or a native. The head is generally
large, with a greater proportion behind than before the ears. The
forehead is long, narrow, and sloping backward. The skin is dark;
the hair is jet black, straight, long, and coarse, but neither curly nor
woolly ; the eyes are black and lively ; the face is broad, the mouth
large, the lips thick and prominent; the nose short, with its point
slightly turning upwards; the cheek-bones are high; the skull is so


thick that a blow from their waddy seldom produces any impression
on it; their teeth are invariably white and regular. In all parts of
this country where I have met the blacks, I observed that they
emitted a peculiarly strong and disagreeable odour, which is not at all
owing to want of cleanliness. So strong indeed is this odour, that
cattle smell it at a considerable distance; and thus warned of the ap-
proach of the blacks, whose spears they have been taught by experi-
ence to dread, gallop away to some place of safety.
The language of the blacks sounds very guttural to a European
ear, until accustomed to it. Many of the words, however, especially
their names of places, are not only harmonious, hut very expressive,
and denote some peculiarity or characteristic of these places. It is
therefore much to be regretted that the whites, influenced chiefly by
vanity, should discontinue these native names, in order to “ call their
lands by their own names.”
The blacks have no writings, no hieroglyphics, no signs, to record
past events, no works of art, no monument of any description. The
following is a specimen of the most common words in their language:
Calleen, water; patter, food; bulga,hill; hirnble, ground; moru,
road or path; gunya, hut; pelageree, wife; murrumbidgee, river;
cunuma, snow ; toggra, cold; mundarra, thunder; nurumo or wallen,
rain; nangree, night or sleep; waddy, tree or stick; mungee, fish;
cobhra, head; mandoi, foot; narang, small; cabonn, large or much ;
budgeree, good; corodgee, doctor; uroka, sun; crammer, to steal;
yaen, to go; hundygerry, to understand; yahber, to speak; burra-
burrai, to make haste. They count by moons. Their mode of count-
ing, except when they do it by signs, by holding up their fingers, is
extremely clumsy and imperfect. Goody, one ; blythum, two ; coody
blythum, three ; bulla bulla, four ; bulla bulla coody, five, &c Among
them infanticide is and has been frequent. It is sometimes difficult to
point out the motives which lead to the commission of this crime. It
is not always to he ascribed to the want of affection on the part of the
mother, except, perhaps, in the case of half-caste male children.
Captain Sturt, while on the journey down the Murray in 1830, wit-
nessed a black follow kill his infant child by knocking its head against
a stone, after which he threw it on the fire, and then devoured it.
Here was an instance of infanticide, committed apparently from the
want of food, as well as from the want of affection.
The want of affection is beyoud all doubt a frequent cause. A
black woman, who -was seen committing this act by knocking her
child’s brains out against a tree, was once pointed out to me ; and on


thick that a blow from their waddy seldom produces any impression
on it; their teeth are invariably white and regular. In all parts of
this country where I have met the blacks, I observed that they
emitted a peculiarly strong and disagreeable odour, which is not at all
owing to want of cleanliness. So strong indeed is this odour, that

nessed a black follow kill his infant child by knocking its head against

Here was an instance of infanticide, committed apparently from the
want of food, as well as from the want of affection.
The want of affection is beyoud all doubt a frequent cause. A
black woman, who -was seen committing this act by knocking her
child’s brains out against a tree, was once pointed out to me ; and on


my asking her why she had committed such a crime, she quickly and
coolly replied, “ Pickaninny too much cry.”
The famous Bennilong, whose society was so much courted in
England, assigned a totally different reason for murdering his infant
child. Having followed his wife’s body to the grave, he astonished
the bystanders by placing the living child along with the dead mother,
in the same grave, which was instantly filled up by the other native
blacks in attendance. The defence which the father (Bennilong) made
for this unnatural act was, that the mother being dead, no woman
could he found willing to nurse the child, and that therefore it would
soon die a worse death.
There is apparently very little trouble in rearing black children.
The child is generally carried by the mother on her shoulder, some-
times in a hag of net-work made of bark filaments ; and sometimes
the child is seen slung over her shoulder, and held by one leg, the
little black head swinging like a pendulum athwart the mother’s back
as she walks. I have been assured by an eminent medical practi-
tioner, who had various opportunities of observing the fact, that there
is one part of the original curse which the black mothers are not
doomed to experience to the same extent as European mothers.
At a very early age the male children learn a variety of gymnas-
tic exercises. I have seen a boy, whose age, I was told by the mother,
was just four times as many moons as she had fingers on both hands,
or about three years and a-quarter, dance, wrestle, swim, throw the
spear and boomerang, and sing their famous national tunes. The
happy little fellow had never in his life been subjected to the bondage
of wearing any clothing. It is an amusing spectacle to witness half-
a-dozen little boys and girls, stark naked, engaged in a sham fight with
their yam sticks. They display an amazing degree of presence of
mind, agility, and good humour, while they thrust, parry, and ward.
The age of puberty among the blacks is from thirteen to fourteen.
The families are small. I have heard of twins, but have never seen
them among the aborgines.
There is one respect in which the blacks far excel Europeans,
namely, in the perfection in which they (the blacks) possess the five
senses, especially sight, hearing, and smelling. A European would be
quite astonished at their sharpness of sight, quickness of hearing, and
keenness of smell. They can trace a man or beast over rocks or hard
ground, where a white man could see no mark whatever. Among
thousands of objects of every shape, size, and hue, the black fellow’s
quick eye can detect, some hundreds of yards off, an opossum sitting

ground, where a white man could see no mark whatever. Among
thousands of objects of every shape, size, and hue, the black fellow’s
quick eye can detect, some hundreds of yards off, an opossum sitting


on a limb of a tree. And they put their ears to the ground, and can
tell you if there is anything moving within an immense distance of
the spot. This quickness of hearing has enabled many of them living
among us to pick up many words and phrases in the English language,
in an incredibly short time.
Their smell is nearly as keen as that of a Scotch terrier, and they
turn this natural qualification to good account, in smelling at the
cavities of stringy trees, when hunting opossums, their favourite food.
I have not had equal opportunities of proving whether these people
possess the two remaining senses, those of touch and taste, in equal
perfection. The necessity which they are under of constantly exercis-
ing, at least three of their senses, both in providing their daily food, and
in guarding against sudden attacks from their enemies, may have con-
tributed to improve these senses ; but these causes are insufficient to
account for the very great superiority, in this respect, of the black
man over the white. I fully believe that this superiority is partly
inherent or natural, not acquired.
At the age of puberty, the young man has two of his front teeth
knocked out. The two fore teeth of the upper jaw are accordingly
found wanting in all adult males. It was in order to make a man of
him that his friends had inflicted this cruel punishment; which is,
however, immediately followed by one of great consolation, namely,
that he is thenceforward at liberty to take a wife wherever he can find
one to his taste; whether he is to her taste or not, is a matter of very
little consequence.
The chastity of both sexes among the blacks is very defective
indeed, as may be satisfactorily proved by the number of black women
cohabiting, with the knowledge and consent of their sable husbands,
in all parts of the interior, with white hut-keepers—the number of
half-caste children seen at every black fellow’s camp—and, above all,
by the number of white men daily under the medical care of practi-
tioners throughout the colony.
Polygamy, which Moses never approved of, but merely connived
at, and that only for the hardness of the people’s hearts, is not only
permitted, but practised to a very great extent among the Australian
blacks. I know several black fellows who have each of them a
number of wives. A strong, and rather handsome fellow, named
Yarry, who frequently assisted me at sheep-washing, has generally
half-a-dozen wives; and he is also continually changing them.
Within my own recollection he has divorced four or five of them, in
order to make room for an equal number of younger and prettier girls;

Within my own recollection he has divorced four or five of them, in
order to make room for an equal number of younger and prettier girls;


for he displays no small degree of taste in his selections. Several
young men, however, who found it difficult, in the present scarcity of
women, to get wives of any sort, have often complained to me, that
“ Yarry was cahonn greedy;” a remark, the justice of which my
conscience constrained me to admit, though I had no wish to be the
means of sowing sedition, not knowing where it might end, among the
black population. There was one political benefit: Yarry’s castaway
wives if not too old, were readily picked up by young men who had no
wives at all.
The blacks use both animal and vegetable food, hut they neither
cultivate vegetables nor rear animals. A short description of their
food, and their mode of procuring it, may not be uninteresting.
Opossums which are very abundant in all thinly-inhabited parts of
the colony, constitute the principal article of food among the blacks.
These opossums are generally caught as they lodge in the hollow
trunk of a tree, at some elevation from the ground. The black fellow
can, in most cases, know, before taking the trouble of ascending the
tree, whether an opossum is there. The hollow limb, or tree, in which
the animal rests, is open at the top, and if the aperture is deep, it is
sometimes necessary to smoke it out, which is done by setting fire to
the tree, when the opossum, to avoid being suffocated, rushes out, and
leaps on the ground, where the black fellow's dog immediately catches
it. Bandicoots, kangaroo-rats, and squirrels, which are also very
plentiful in the bush, and considered very good eating by the blacks,
are caught in nearly the same way as the opossum. Wombats are
differently caught. The flesh of these animals, which commonly
weigh from 20 lbs. to 60 lbs,, is considered very delicious. I have
never seen the blacks catch either fish or wild ducks otherwise than by
spearing, in which long practice has rendered them perfect adepts.
They do, however, catch fish with nets, made by the black women,
either from tough hark or a species of grass.
A never-failing, and is it said, a most delicious article of food
among the blacks, is a white worm, about the length and thickness of
your little finger. This worm, which is very abundant in all parts of
the colony, is cut out of the cavities, or from under the bark of trees,
and may easily be procured by a man who can catch neither fish,
fowl, nor flesh in the Australian wilds. I have cut it out of the tree,
and have seen it eaten by white as well as black men. In the heart
of the main root of a small sappling, called the Myall or Boree, and
within a foot or two of the trunk, this worm is certain to be found.
The knowledge of this fact might he useful to those people classically


for he displays no small degree of taste in his selections. Several
young men, however, who found it difficult, in the present scarcity of

The knowledge of this fact might he useful to those people classically


called “new chums,” or, indeed, to any man who may chance to lose
his way in the bush. The situation of this worm is frequently indi-
cated by a small aperture, nearly adjacent. The only tool required is
a tomahawk, with which the traveller can cut out food to satisfy his
appetite, and bark to cover him at night. The roots of a shrub, called
by the natives, “ Quondong,” are good food, after having been roasted
for some time under the ashes. The fruit of the same tree or shrub is
also in great repute among the blacks. The native yam, dug up here
in great abundance, is considered not only nutritious, but very pala-
table when roasted, like the quondong root, under the ashes. Native
currants, native raspberries, and wild cherries, are eaten by blacks and
whites. They are very expert at discovering bees’ nests. I have
seen them watch, and then follow a bee in his flight until they disco-
vered his abode. I myself have often eaten honey caught here, and
given to me by the blacks. Guanas and snakes are excellent food.
The black snake I have not only seen eaten, but have dined on it
myself. The blacks cook it by half broiling it on the fire. When
thus prepared it is as white as an eel, and as tender as a chicken.
The blacks, however, will not eat of it unless it is killed by themselves ;
the reason is obvious; a white man seldom succeeds in killing a snake
with the first blow; the consequence is, that the animal being only
wounded, becomes desperate, and often, in the agony of torture, inserts
its fangs into its own body, and thus diffuses the poison through every
part of it. Black and brown snakes are abundant in most parts of the
colony. I have killed several scores of them. They vary in length
from three to fourteen feet. The most common length is about five
feet. They generally try to get out of your way; but after you have
struck them the first blow, they show fight and face you furiously.
The danger is when you accidentally tread on them as you walk
through the long grass; their bite being almost certain death.
In the cooking of their food the blacks are by no means delicate.
After having skinned the animal they have caught, they throw it on
the fire, and when it is well heated, but not half roasted, they pull it
off, tear it with their teeth and fingers, and voraciously devour it,
entrails and everything. Sometimes they do not even wait to skin it.
They merely pull off the hair; after which they half-roast the carcase
with the skin, both of which they will then eat.
They have no scruples as to eating anything they deem either
nutritious or palatable, and they are enormous eaters. About five
years ago, as I happened to be drafting sheep, with two black fellows
assisting me, on the Hume River, we smothered a yearling wether,


called “new chums,” or, indeed, to any man who may chance to lose
his way in the bush. The situation of this worm is frequently indi-

years ago, as I happened to be drafting sheep, with two black fellows
assisting me, on the Hume River, we smothered a yearling wether,


which would have weighed nearly forty pounds. At their own request
I ordered the carcase to be given to those two black men, who, after
having skinned it, threw it on a large fire, where it was left till half-
roasted, when they sat down and continued eating until a late hour of
the night. They slept by the fireside, got up, according to their usual
habit when they have plenty of food, two or three times during the
night, to resume the business of eating ; by noon next day, or within
twenty-four hours, those two men had ate the whole of the forty
pounds of mutton ; The result was, that for the ensuing twenty-four
hours they would do nothing for me ; they lay rolling themselves on
the ground, heavily groaning in pain, and with their hands rubbing
their bellies, exclaiming, “ Cabonn buggel along bingee ” (that is, I
am very sick in the stomach).
The blacks have no fixed time for eating. Hunger alone regulates
their diets.
They have no fermented liquor among them ; but, by steeping an
empty sugar-bag in water, they obtain what they call “ hull” which
makes them drunk and play a variety of capers. Indeed, very little
intoxicates them. A pipeful of tobacco has been known to produce
this effect.
The capacity of the Australian black for sustained exertions is not
nearly equal to that of Europeans.
Among both sexes the practice of piercing or scarifying the arras,
hack, and breast, in every fantastic form, is prevalent. The only
reason which I have ever heard them assign for this practice is, that
it makes them metong (strong) for fighting ; and there is no doubt that
scarification of the skin renders it less liable to injury from blows.
These people are beautiful dancers. It would perfectly astonish
you to witness their corrobaries or grand balls. These nightly meet-
ings are held at the time of the full moon; such variety and agility of
movement, such fantastic capers and ludicrous positions, the dancers
all the while mimicking the motion of kangaroos, emus, frogs, and
other animals, and yet keeping exact time to music, for which they
have excellent ears. In April last year a tribe of a hundred adult
blacks, besides children, arrived at my hut on the morning of Friday,
and began to prepare for the grand corrobary. For appearing at the
great corrobaries in England, the ladies and gentlemen prepare by
putting on their bodies some things considered valuable, such as fine
clothes, and a variety of brilliant toys, including a specimen of every-
thing that can be found in a jeweller’s shop. Here the fashion is very
different ; for, instead of putting on ornaments, the dancers put off


which would have weighed nearly forty pounds. At their own request
I ordered the carcase to be given to those two black men, who, after
having skinned it, threw it on a large fire, where it was left till half-

clothes, and a variety of brilliant toys, including a specimen of every-
thing that can be found in a jeweller’s shop. Here the fashion is very
different ; for, instead of putting on ornaments, the dancers put off


whatever they previously wore, and enter the ball naked as they were
born. And yet no lady or young dandy in England ever spent more
time in preparing and decorating the body for attending a public hall.
Every inch of the black naked skin was on this occasion ornamented
with either chalk or red and yellow ochre. By means of those cheap
materials, which showed well on a dark skin, the black fellow made
his whole body appear as if covered with tartan. Lines horizontal,
vertical, and oblique, forming squares, parallelograms, rhombs, rhom-
boids, and trapeziums, each measuring about an inch in diagonal,
constituted a perfectly dazzling scene, through which, I have no
doubt, many a nice young lady had on that evening lost her heart.
Like most English corrobaries, dancing commenced about nine o’clock
p.m., and generally continued till two o’clock next morning. This
went on for five successive nights, that is, from Friday to Tues-
day inclusive. I attended the ball every evening except Sunday.
They had vocal and instrumental music ; the musicians were about
twenty in number, and consisted of both males and females. I counted
fourteen females (musicians); all these sat on a log, with their opos-
sum cloaks folded up into bags, which, as on so many drums, they
beat with their open hands, and at the same time sang together, in
perfect harmony, their famous national tune of “Maley, maley, ma-a
ma.” The gentlemen musicians (six, I think, in number), were all
standing in a line in front of the dancing circle, each of them holding
two short, dry sticks, which were struck against one another in unison,
and accompanied, like the drumming among the ladies, with vocal
music.
The grotesque appearance of so many dancers, the combination of
so many well-tuned voices, added to such instrumental music, the
shouts of merriment, and “the loud laugh that spoke the vacant
mind,” the fine moonlight night, the clear sky, the soft bracing air,
surpassing “ the balmy gales of Araby the bless’d,” and the beauty of
the valley, intersected by the limpid river, constituted, as the French
would call it, a “tout ensemble,” which to an artist would have been
an interesting picture.
When a lady wanted refreshment at this ball, instead of stepping,
leaning on the arm of some tightly-laced dandy, as on corresponding
occasions in England, into an adjoining apartment, she merely walked
into the river at my door, put her mouth to, the current, and thus
cooled herself both inside and outside : or if she felt disposed to taste
anything more substantial than pure water, she went to the camp,
and took out from a greasy net-bag a piece of half-roasted kangaroo


whatever they previously wore, and enter the ball naked as they were
born. And yet no lady or young dandy in England ever spent more

to the hall.
I noticed that, in one particular, the ladies at this grand ball
closely resembled some of their frail sisters at English corrobaries, by
displaying nearly as much skill, taste, and fine feeling, in their
envious and biting criticism and uncharitable remarks on one another.
But no sensible man will ever blame the black ladies for this habit.
That among the English ladies such a common habit as this is either
unchristian or improper, no writer has ever had, or will ever have,
the temerity to assert; and surely, if an additional diamond, jewel,
gold chain, or any other such childish toy, is sufficient to justify
envious remarks at an English corrobary, an additional line of chalk
or red ochre ought to justify similar criticism at a black corrobary—•
and assuredly the liberty of the tongue is not less valuable than the
liberty of the press. It must be admitted that in one respect the
black ladies, when they do wear clothes, are centuries before their
white sisters in England. That abominable practice of compressing
the waist, so as to reduce it to one-half its natural circumference, is
here unknown. Scarifying the body, and knocking out the two front
teeth, are nothing in point of cruelty to this monstrous tight lacing,
which has sent many an interesting English lady to an early tomb.
Such a species of suicide, often encouraged by the vanity of the
mother, ought to deprive the victim of all benefit of clergy.
The only dress worn by the blacks, who do not choose always to
go naked, consists of opossum or kangaroo skins, sewed together into
the form of a blanket, by means of the sinews of some animal, used
as thread, and a pointed bone for a needle. A covering thus made is
very warm, as I can testify from many years’ experience. The same
dross is worn by both sexes. English blankets are now fast supersed-
ing the opossum cloaks among the blacks.
The blacks are short-lived. At the age of forty they appear old
men and women. This statement is supported by the invariable testi-
mony of every experienced colonist with whom I have conversed on
the subject. This premature decay is no doubt partly owing to their
constant exposure to alternations of heat and cold, and to their pre-
carious mode of procuring subsistence: this week they cram them-
selves to surfeit, and the next week they may go for days with an
empty stomach, suffering the pains and penalties of that vacuum which
nature abhors.
Their sick are badly treated. In the absence of medical skill, of
clothing, of house shelter, and of stored provision, the case of the sick

man or woman among the blacks, especially in the winter season, is
truly to he deplored. Their quack doctors and quack medicines, as
among civilised communities, do more mischief than good. In some
cases it is possible that nature might have effected a cure, had not the
empiric with his nostrum interfered.
When a man dies—especially if young, and has gradually pined
away—a neighbouring tribe is blamed for it, as having “crammer
gourai” (stolen the fat), by some invisible agency, and thus caused
his death. In this case nothing but life for life will satisfy the
bereaved relations. I tried by reason and ridicule to convince the
blacks that such an effect could never have been produced by the
cause which they assigned; that as the two tribes were living widely
apart, with many intervening mountains between them, and without
any communication, and especially as there was no visible cut in the
body of the deceased, whence the gourai , or fat, could he taken out, it
was quite unreasonable to blame their neighbours for it. But the
old black fellows only shook their heads, laughed at my ignorance,
and hinted that that was all we white fellows knew about the matter.
This is one of the thousand fearful effects of ignorance and super-
stition — a curse from which England owes her emancipation to
Christianity alone—for this very superstition was once prevalent in
our native land, in Italy, and some other parts of Europe, as it is still
prevalent among some tribes both in India and America.
A black fellow’s burial is conducted in the following manner: —
After having dug a round hole about five feet deep, they cut at the
bottom another hole horizontally. Into this latter they thrust the
dead body doubled, the head up, the knees to his mouth, his opossum
cloak wrapped about him ; and then all the openings which remain
are filled up with long dry grass. The grave, or first hole, is now
filled up with sticks, covered over with bark, and finished with earth.
Having put a rough paling round it to prevent the intrusion of cattle,
they go away, and never again mention the name of the deceased.
The nearest relatives, when mourning for the dead, cover their
heads all over with white clay; and at certain intervals, generally
after dusk, they set up piteous bowlings. I have often been thus
disturbed at night by the loud lamentations of some helpless mother
who had buried probably her only child.
Their ideas of a future state are extremely vague and indefinite.
Many of them believe that after death they will “jump up white
fellows; ” and they confidently assert that, among the white Europeans
here, they recognise several of their own deceased friends and relations.

They have" no fixed abodes, and no houses of any description.
Their only shelter at night from cold, wind, or rain, consists of one or
two sheets of bark placed obliquely on end, having the upper end
resting on a horizontal stick or ridge pole, supported by two wooden
forks stuck in the ground about six feet apart, and five or six feet
high. Their fire is always outside, and in front of this hut. If the
wind shifts, the position of the hut is changed in less than five
minutes; the front of it, and of course the fire, being placed to lee-
ward. Each family occupies a separate hut. They can strike fire by
quickly rubbing against one another two dry sticks of the grass tree.
They have no domestic animal except the dog, which is useful to
them in catching opossums, &c.
They have no property, except their wives, children, dogs, wea-
pons of war, nets, opossum cloaks, hunting and fishing grounds , to
preserve and regulate all which very few laws are required. Their
weapons are the following,—spears, boomerang, null a-nullah, bark
shield, marga, tomahawk, and a woomera, which is a stick with a
notch in it, and is used for throwing the spear, which, with the aid of
the woomera, they can throw and kill at one hundred yaids. Their
tomahawks used to he of stone, —one of which is now in my posses-
sion. They seemed to answer their purpose—that of cutting bark,
and notching trees to climb, tolerably well; hut since the arrival of
Europeans here, stone tomahawks have been superseded by iron ones.
With a tomahawk the black fellow can accomplish wonders ; with it
he can dig to any depth required, cut bark, build his hut, climb trees,
and cut out opossums. In climbing a straight smooth tree without a
branch or limb, he begins by making a couple of notches, into which
he puts his big toes, after having stuck the tomahawk between his
teeth, and grasped the tree with both hands. Having got his feet
firmly fixed in these notches, which are the first two steps in the
ascent, holding on by his left, he now disengages his right arm, takes
the tomahawk, and cuts two more notches as higher steps: and thus
he continues ascending step by step, carrying his tomahawk in his
teeth, until he reaches the desired altitude. I have seen him in this
manner ascend a tree a hundred feet without a branch, as quickly as
an old sailor could climb from the deck of a ship to her royals.
Through famine and war, vice and disease, the blacks are rapidly
diminishing in numbers. It is lamentable to think that this should
almost invariably be the doom of all savages similarly circumstanced.

whose proud boast is, that the sun never sets on her dominions—
should, notwithstanding this pre-eminence, establish her colonies in
the destruction of the native inhabitants, who are swept away before
the march of civilization. While England’s sons, in obedience to the
Divine command, go forth to multiply, replenish, and subdue the
earth, the original inhabitants rapidly disappear as snow before the
melting sun : the arrival of the white man has sealed their doom, and
no power short of Omnipotence seems now competent to arrest the
progress of extermination.
The three great causes of war among the blacks are territorial
aggression, murdering one of the neighbouring tribes, and the abduc-
tion of wives, whether by stealth or violence.
It is a well-ascertained fact, not only that they are cannibals, but
that they very frequently eat the bodies of those taken in war. A
respectable gentleman, named Morrice, residing on the Hume River,
came lately on a party of fifty or sixty blacks, while in the very act
of roasting pieces of human flesh. He saw some parts of the same
carcass in the camp, which were no doubt reserved for a future repast,
and he was given to understand that it was the body of a female from
a neighbouring tribe, whom they had just killed.
A stout black fellow, named Paddy, who frequently lives with me,
has been a great warrior in his time, and committed several murders.
When lately describing to me one of the last murders (that of a black
boy, about twelve years of age) in which he was concerned, he stated
that this boy, who belonged to a neighbouring tribe that had caused
the death of some one in Paddy’s tribe, was employed by a squatter
up the Hume River, where he (Paddy) and three more watched him
for some days, until at last they found him on horseback looking after
cattle, when all four rushed on him, pulled him off the horse, cut him
up with their tomahawks, roasted and ate him. Old Paddy, licking
his lips, added it was “ Gabon budgery patter like it Emu,” and that if I
wished it, he would bring me a piece of the next he killed. For more
reasons than one I declined, however, this generous offer.
There are some very bad points in the character of the Australian
blacks. Like most savages, they are both treacherous and avaricious.
Neither time nor space will permit me here to multiply proofs for the
purpose of substantiating this charge. In Major (now Sir Thomas)
Mitchell’s expedition, in the year 1835, down the Lachlan River, he
says, “ A chief, to whom I had given presents and shown particular
attention, had been the first to attack us. To conciliate them (the

immediately used in cutting the cording of our tents.”
It would be difficult, perhaps impossible, to state the probable
number of aborigines now in Australia. That they are few, com-
pared to the immense extent of territory over which they spread,
admits not of a doubt; and it is equally certain that they are rapidly
diminishing, especially within the limits of all the Australian colonies.
One cause of the diminution of the blacks is, beyond all doubt, to
be found in the disproportion between the sexes in several districts of
the colony. The official return from one district gives only two
women to twenty-eight men; two boys, but no girls!
The blacks seldom make any provision for the future, but literally
act on the principle that “ sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.”
A friend of mine gave some cuts of potatoes for seed to a black fellow,
which he was induced to plant, on his being assured that after a short
time these few cuttings would produce a large quantity of potatoes.
Two days afterwards, the black fellow returned to my friend, to com-
plain that the young potatoes did “not yet jump up.” He then,
holding up two fingers, asked if it would yet be so many days before
the young potatoes should “jump up ; ” and on my friend admitting
that it might be as many days as there were fingers to both his hands,
he immediately went away, dug up all the cuttings of the potatoes,
and ate them, saying that “ white fellow is all gammon.”
They make their wives carry everything belonging to them, while
they themselves proudly strut in front, shouldering their weapons of
war, and thus proving, if any proof of such a palpable fact was re-
quired, that they are the lords of the creation.
It may be interesting to the philosopher to be informed, that by
intermixture with Europeans some of the phrenologically bad points
disappear in the Australian blacks. Every one of the few half-castes
that I know affords a favourable specimen. In her evidence, given
before a Committee of the Legislative Council, appointed in 1838,
Mrs. Shelley, who kept, for upwards of eight years, the Asylum for
Aboriginal Children (established at Parramatta, by Governor Mac-
quarie, in 1814), states that “ some of the (black) children under her
tuition read and wrote well, and understood arithmetic; that she
always found the half-caste children quicker and more tractable than the
blacks; that several of the girls had married black men, but instead of
having the effect intended, of reclaiming them, they eventually fol-


their wants and show good-will towards them, the more they seemed
to covet what was utterly useless to them, and the more they plotted
our destruction. The very knives we gave them as presents they

lowed their husbands into the hush, after having given away or de-
stroyed all the clothes with which they had been furnished by govern-
ment. Some of the hoys went to sea. Most of the girls turned out
very bad; but there is one exception, in a half-caste girl, who was married
to a white man, and was very industrious, taking in needlework,” &c.
The blacks have no religion, no idols, neither sacrifices nor gifts,
no sacred days or religious ceremonies. Some of them are afraid of
“ muchigang ” (ghosts); and in order to keep away the deble-deble, a
few of them thrust a bone through their noses. The comet which
appeared two years ago greatly alarmed them, and some of them
applied to me for an explanation of this phenomenon, as some rascally
white men told them that its design in paying us a visit was to com-
plete the destruction of the blacks.
They are excellent mimics, and have a keen relish for the ludi-
crous. They enjoy a joke even at their own expense. They are
first-rate shots. It is seldom they miss their aim; as sure as you
hear the report, the animal aimed at is either killed or wounded, un-
less there is some flaw in the piece.
They are fearless riders, and never feel themselves so happy as
when at full gallop. An orphan boy, about ten years of age, rode
about with me for nearly six months of last year. I found him useful
in finding the horses in the morning, &c. At the same time I had
two big black fellows driving bullock-teams for me. They did well
while they continued; but there is no dependence on them for any
length of time, and the laws of their tribe required their attendance
at meetings which deprived me of their services. I have my doubts
whether, without a thorough change in their views and whole charac-
ter, they can ever be induced to exchange their roaming habits for all
the comforts of civilization.
There is evidently a charm in savage life, which is difficult, per-
haps impossible, for a European to appreciate. Bennilong, who was
brought to England, after two years’ enjoyment of European comforts
and refinements, cast away his fine clothes, and then, naked, joined
his old companions in the wilds of Australia. I have repeatedly
given clothes and abundance of food to black fellows; but they soon
got tired of our tame sort of living, threw away their clothes as use-
less lumber, fit only for bondsmen, and then joined their tribe in the
forest to live on grubs and sleep naked under a sheet of bark. This
spectacle would certainly have cheered the heart of Eousseau and
other great admirers of savage life. I know some sensible white men
here who believe that the privations occasionally experienced by the


lowed their husbands into the hush, after having given away or de-
stroyed all the clothes with which they had been furnished by govern-
ment. Some of the hoys went to sea. Most of the girls turned out
very bad; but there is one exception, in a half-caste girl, who was married
to a white man, and was very industrious, taking in needlework,” &c.
The blacks have no religion, no idols, neither sacrifices nor gifts,
no sacred days or religious ceremonies. Some of them are afraid of
“ muchigang ” (ghosts); and in order to keep away the deble-deble, a
few of them thrust a bone through their noses. The comet which
appeared two years ago greatly alarmed them, and some of them
applied to me for an explanation of this phenomenon, as some rascally
white men told them that its design in paying us a visit was to com-
plete the destruction of the blacks.

any predilection for such a life, I will add, that great would be the
surprise of any Englishman who would contrast the servile, crouch-
ing, cringing, drunken blacks lounging about the streets of Sydney,—
after having sold their birthright, their independence, for a morsel of
bread, with the wild inhabitant of the forest in a state of perfect
nudity, as he roams at freedom over immeasurable plains, hills, and
valleys, bearing on his shoulders his weapons of war and imple-
ments of chase, yielding submission to no human power, and with a
characteristic elasticity of movement, firmness of step, and dignity of
gait, proclaiming, not in words, but in every gesture, his hereditary
rights and independence.
When viewing, not one man only, but scores of men of this bold
stamp, I could not help cherishing an anxious wish that some further
efforts should be made to save at least a remnant of this interesting
race from annihilation. Their present condition is a reproach both to
British legislature and to the colonial public. We cannot yet con-
scientiously say, in reference to the Australian blacks, what more
could we have done to this vineyard that we have not done ?
I am clearly of opinion, that if the heralds of the gospel are ever
to make any impression on the aborigines, it must be by joining their
camps, following them in their native wilds, and living on roots,
grubs, and opossums, like themselves. It was precisely in this way
that Mr. Elliot, the famous missionary, acquired the language, gained
the confidence, and by the aid of the divine Spirit changed the hearts,
of many of the red Indians in North America; and precisely similar
was the plan successfully adopted by Mr. Anderson, the missionary
at the Cape of Good Hope. Let the Church at home, therefore, ap-
point some missionary of apostolic zeal, self-denial, robust constitu-
tion, and unconquerable enterprise, to accompany the blacks in their
wanderings, and accommodate himself to their savage mode of life.

CHAPTER XV.
HINTS TO EMIGRANTS.
There are only two classes of men, physicians and lawyers, to
whose advice any high value is attached ; and their advice is highly


valued for no other reason that I can tell, than that neither of them
has ever been known to open his lips, by way of giving advice, with-
out having previously “received in hand,” as payment, the sum of
at least twenty-one shillings of the current coin of the realm. As it
happens, very unfortunately for me, that I am neither a lawyer nor
a “ doctor,” I scarcely expect that intending emigrants will attach
much importance to the advice which I am now about to offer to
them. It shall, however, he freely and honestly tendered.
This subject divides itself into three parts: first , what you ought
to do before sailing; secondly , what you ought to do on the voyage;
and, thirdly , what you ought to do after landing in Australia.
Having made up your mind to emigrate to Australia, apply, if you
wish a free passage, to one or other of the emigration agents. They
will give you all the necessary information required, and the govern-
ment takes care that none but sound and sea-worthy ships are char-
tered for the conveyance of passengers to the colonies. The attention
of the British Parliament has been long and successfully occupied in
devising the best means for securing the comforts of emigrants from
Great Britain and Ireland to all parts of the world; and accordingly,
in August, 1842, an Act, intituled the “Passengers’ Act,” was passed!
regulating the carrying of passengers in merchant vessels. Every
captain carrying above thirty passengers is bound to have on board
two copies of this Act; and he is also bound to give a perusal of one
of these copies to any of his passengers who may ask for it. Every
passenger ought to acquaint himself with its contents. He will there
see how much space in the ship he can lawfully claim; also the quan-
tity of water, the quantity and quality of the food, &c., &c., to which
he is entitled. Many skippers, who take it for granted that their pas-
sengers are not aware of the existence of such a parliamentary Act
curtail their just allowance of space, water, and provisions. For any
and every violation of this law, the emigrant, on arrival at his desti-
nation, can pull up the skipper, and in a most summary way obtain
damages for all injuries thus sustained during the voyage. This Act
of August, 1842, also provides that no skipper shall carry more than
in the proportion of three persons for every five tons of the registered
burden of the ship, the master and crew being included in such pre-
scribed number.
The Passengers’ Act does not apply to other than steerage passen-
gers ; it is therefore the more incumbent on you to exercise great care
and caution in selecting your ship. Get some competent friend to
examine her. Ascertain what her age is—how she stands at Xloyd’s

and caution in selecting your ship. Get some competent friend to
examine her. Ascertain what her age is—how she stands at Xloyd’s


—whether sheas amply provisioned—whether her captain is a steady
man; for some of these skippers are ignorant, tyrannical, and drunken
vagabonds, whose characters you can seldom know till you are fairly
out at sea, where for four months you are completely at their mercy.
See that the ship carries a medical man. Stipulate that in case the
ship should touch at any intermediate port for either supplies or
repairs, you are to be maintained on board without any extra expense.
If you have reasonable doubts as to the honour and respectability of
captain and owners, charterers or agents, get a written agreement,
binding them to give you daily a certain fixed quantity and quality of
provisions and water. Passenger ships sailing from London are gene-
rally better provisioned than ships from any other port.
As our winter never interposes any interruption to out-door work,
it matters little at what time of the year the emigrant sails for Austra-
lia. If there is one period preferable to another for starting, it is,
perhaps, the months of July and August; since, in this case, the ship
would in all likelihood arrive about the commencement of our harvest,
—and in December and January the settlers are daily arriving in
Sydney or Melbourne with their wool, which occasions an additional
circulation of money, and an increased demand for all sorts of labour,
as, on the return of the wool drays with the yearly supplies of tea,
sugar, slops, &c., to the stations, whatever servants are required are
then generally hired and forwarded to their destination.
You are to remember that the average voyage from England to
Australia is nearly four months, or about sixteen weeks, during which
period you cannot calculate on getting any article washed on ship-
board ; you must therefore provide yourself with linen sufficient for
that time. During one part of the voyage you will be in high and
cold latitudes, where warm clothing is necessary; while during
another part you will be exposed to the scorching heat of a vertical
sun, when nothing but the very lightest covering is bearable. You
ought, therefore, to provide against each extreme, by procuring at
least one suit of each description of clothing. You will find regatta
(blue) shirts the best suited for a sea-voyage; and if you go after-
wards into the bush, they will best answer your purpose. All articles
of value liable to become damaged by sea air, &c., ought to be packed
up in cases lined with tin. You are aware that, as a passenger, you
will have to provide your own bedding for the voyage, and also what-
ever candles you burn in your own cabin. If you are a man given to
reading, as I hope you are, I would advise you to buy for your own
use a large transparent lantern, six pounds of wax or sperm candles,

and some amusing books. Some lemon-juice and raspberry vinegar
you would find a great luxury when crossing the torrid zone.
As notes, even of the Bank of England, do not pass in the Austra-
lian colonies, if you have any money, carry it out either in hard sove-
reigns or by a bank bill on the Bank of Australasia, or Union Bank of
Australia. The office of the former is No. 2, Moorgate Street; and
that of the latter is No. 38, Old Broad Street, London.
Do not be guilty of the folly of bringing out your money, either
in goods for our fluctuating market, or in an order on some Sydney
merchant, who may be insolvent before your arrival here, or, if not,
who may probably contrive (to use an elegant and purely classical
term) to humbug you before he parts with your money. I must also
caution you against letters of introduction, especially if you have any
money. They are easily obtained, but, believe me, they are the most
dangerous instruments you can carry about with you. If you have a
bank bill, and are known to have it, rather put a box of lucifer-
matches, or any other combustible materials, than a letter of introduc-
tion in the same pocket with it. If you are without money in either
pocket, letters of introduction are perfectly harmless. In this case
you may carry them in safety. But remember also that in this case
they will not even procure you a dinner. When you deliver them to
the Sydney great man, you will receive a gracious nod, followed by
a few canting common-place phrases, expressive of good wishes for
your future welfare and prosperity. Place no dependence on the
promises or patronage of colonial gentlemen. They came here to
benefit themselves; and if they find they can make no profit by you,
they will scarcely notice you the next day as they meet you in the
street. Many clever and respectable emigrants who brought out
letters of introduction to the governor from influential functionaries at
home, expected that their fortune was made ; but Sir George Gipps is
too honest and independent a man to delude any emigrant with hopes
never to be realized.
Expect no government situation here, unless you arrive with
something more to the purpose than a mere recommendation. Nothing
but the bond, the bond—treasury warrant or direct appointment from
Downing Street—will avail you in Australia. Whether rich or poor,
give yourself, then, no trouble about procuring mere introductory
letters. Seldom have they benefited any man who brought them, and
they have been the means which led many a simple-minded man to
have his little capital filched from him. If it would answer any good
purpose, some men who now hold their heads high, and occupy situa-


and some amusing books. Some lemon-juice and raspberry vinegar
you would find a great luxury when crossing the torrid zone.

bation as nothing better than infamous swindlers.
The emigrant farmer or settler can safely calculate on purchasing,
at a very moderate rate, in the colony whatever agricultural imple-
ments and gear he may require. I would also recommend him to
bring no indented servants with him. Mr. M’Arthur, a respectable
colonist, who has written a very able work on Australia, says that
“ there is no instance on record in the history of the colony where
settlers have been able to prevent their indented servants, hired in
England, from turning dissatisfied, and then leaving them after their
arrival.” The mechanic ought to bring with him a complete assort-
ment of the best tools for his trade ; and let me suggest to him that
his edged tools ought to he of the very best description, otherwise they
will make no impression on our Australian wood, which in general is
as hard as old English oak. In order to preserve his edged tools, and
indeed all sorts of iron ware, from rust on the voyage, let him besmear
them all over with grease —oil or tallow will do.
I now proceed to the second division of my subject, which was to
show what ought to be done during the voyage.
Dr. Johnson defines a life on board ship as “ being in prison, with
the chance of being drowned.” If one half of what his sycophantic
biographer, Mr. Boswell, reports he true, Dr. Samuel Johnson, with
all his mass of learning, was a sarcastic surly bear, who said many
clever things, more remarkable for their sprightliness than their cor-
rectness. There is no doubt that on board ship you experience many
inconveniences arising from want of room, want of bodily exercise,
want of employment, and want of many other things to which you
have been accustomed on shore. But if, after all these drawbacks,
you do not enjoy yourself, it will he your own fault. I will venture
to assert, that if I were along with you for a couple of hours, in some
old-fashioned London bookseller’s shop, I could put you in the way of
buying, for a few pounds sterling, a collection of books, the reading of
which would keep you in one roar of laughter from the London Docks
to Sydney Heads. On board ship you will he as free from care as the
unsophisticated clown, who had been for years so regular in his attend-
ance at the parish church, as at last to extort from his clergyman the
following compliment:—“John, the institution of the Sabbath is a
great blessing to the poor man ; and I am happy to see, from your
regular attendance at church, that you duly appreciate this blessing.”
To which John devoutly replied, “ Sir, I finds it a great blessing; I
goes to church every Sunday, throws myself in the seat, shuts my


tions of trust and emolument, might here be exposed to public repro-
bation as nothing better than infamous swindlers.

To which John devoutly replied, “ Sir, I finds it a great blessing; I
goes to church every Sunday, throws myself in the seat, shuts my


eyes, takes up my feet in the pew, and thinks of nothing.” Happy
oblivion, J ohn ! ,
Now, from London to Sydney you may enjoy more than all the
happiness and all the blessings which John enjoyed in the parish
church. I hope that, instead of thinking of nothing, you will think
of many subjects of importance; and that, instead of shutting your
eyes, at least during the day-time, as John did, you will employ them
in reading what will improve your mind and your heart also. Every
man, however well informed he may be, requires now to devote a
considerable portion of his time to reading, in order to keep up with
what is contemptuously styled the “ march of intellect.”
Shipboard is your place for study. Consider every hour valuable,
and diligently employ it in reading or meditation. It is want of
employment that has been the most frequent occasion of quarrels
among passengers on a long voyage. It was the house found empty,
swept and garnished, that was entered and taken possession of by evil
spirits. It was so eighteen hundred years ago, and it will always so
continue.
“For want of occupation is not rest;
A mind quite vacant is a mind distress’d.”
By judiciously dividing your time, you may read a large number
of useful works during the voyage of four months; and let me add,
that you will have nothing else to employ your time,—for I defy any
man to fill a page with a description of all that he can possibly see
worthy of notice from London to Sydney.
In ancient times, those who went down to the sea in ships might
no doubt have seen great wonders in the deep, for everything was
then new, and before the art of printing and the discovery of the
polarity of the magnetic needle, the information of mankind was very
limited ; but tempora mutantur, —for neither the “ Penny Encyclope-
dia ” nor “ Chambers’ Information for the People” was then known ;
and I assure you that no such wonders as were witnessed in ancient
times are likely to be now seen on a voyage from England to Botany
Bay. A man may sail a dozen times round the world, and, after all,
know just as much of the world as did the blind fiddler, who boasted
of his travels after he had made the tour of Europe.
It is often an agreeable relief to some of the passengers if you
touch at the Cape of Good Hope for supplies; you then have an
opportunity of visiting both Cape Town and its neighbourhood.
Among the objects of the latter deserving the notice of strangers, are
the celebrated vineyards of Constantia, producing the famous wine


eyes, takes up my feet in the pew, and thinks of nothing.” Happy
oblivion, J ohn ! ,
Now, from London to Sydney you may enjoy more than all the
happiness and all the blessings which John enjoyed in the parish
church. I hope that, instead of thinking of nothing, you will think
of many subjects of importance; and that, instead of shutting your
eyes, at least during the day-time, as John did, you will employ them
in reading what will improve your mind and your heart also. Every
man, however well informed he may be, requires now to devote a
considerable portion of his time to reading, in order to keep up with
what is contemptuously styled the “ march of intellect.”
Shipboard is your place for study. Consider every hour valuable,
and diligently employ it in reading or meditation. It is want of
employment that has been the most frequent occasion of quarrels
among passengers on a long voyage. It was the house found empty,
swept and garnished, that was entered and taken possession of by evil
spirits. It was so eighteen hundred years ago, and it will always so
continue.
“For want of occupation is not rest;
A mind quite vacant is a mind distress’d.”
By judiciously dividing your time, you may read a large number
of useful works during the voyage of four months; and let me add,
that you will have nothing else to employ your time,—for I defy any
man to fill a page with a description of all that he can possibly see
worthy of notice from London to Sydney.
In ancient times, those who went down to the sea in ships might
no doubt have seen great wonders in the deep, for everything was
then new, and before the art of printing and the discovery of the
polarity of the magnetic needle, the information of mankind was very
limited ; but tempora mutantur, —for neither the “ Penny Encyclope-
dia ” nor “ Chambers’ Information for the People” was then known ;
and I assure you that no such wonders as were witnessed in ancient
times are likely to be now seen on a voyage from England to Botany
Bay. A man may sail a dozen times round the world, and, after all,
know just as much of the world as did the blind fiddler, who boasted
of his travels after he had made the tour of Europe.
It is often an agreeable relief to some of the passengers if you
touch at the Cape of Good Hope for supplies; you then have an
opportunity of visiting both Cape Town and its neighbourhood.
Among the objects of the latter deserving the notice of strangers, are
the celebrated vineyards of Constantia, producing the famous wine


bearing that name. The ship in which I came touched and remained
at the Cape for nearly a fortnight. You would be much pleased with
the natural beauty and regularity of Cape Town, as well as with the
picturesque situation of Constantia vineyards.
After leaving the Cape, which is in nearly the same latitude as
Sydney, your course is due east, and the wind is generally favour-
able and very strong, occasionally driving you at the rate of from 200
to 250 miles a-day. We made 246 miles in one day—this was our
greatest exploit during the whole voyage. If your watch goes cor-
rectly, it will lose one hour every three or four days, or every fifteen
degrees of east longitude you run down; or, in other words, you will
see the sun by one hour earlier than the inhabitants of Greenwich, for
every fifteen degrees you are to the eastward of that place ; so that by
the time you have reached Port Jackson, which is in longitude
151 17 east, or rather more than ten times fifteen degrees east of
Greenwich, your watch will have lost ten hours and some minutes,
and you must accordingly put it forward all this measure of time, if
you wish to be regulated by the Sydney time.
As you pass Botany Bay (about eight miles before reaching Port
Jackson), you may obtain a glance of the monument erected to the
memory of the unfortunate La Perouse. I have frequently visited
this locality. Here, close to the monument, is the site of a garden
(with broken walls and a few bushes and shrubs) formed by the
I ronch during their stay at this place. Excepting the monument
just named, all that you can see at this inlet are a few fisherman’s
huts, a station for a custom-house officer, and an immense variety of
beautiful wild flowers, which amply justified Sir Joseph Banks in
naming this Botany Bay; which, however, instead of recalling to
the mind of the English reader all that is fragrant, tender, naturally
beautiful and innocuous, only serves to conjure up to the imagination
a hideous assemblage of thieves, robbers, and murderers.
I now come to the third and last division of the subject, which
was to state what, in my opinion, the emigrant ought to do on his
arrival in Australia.
He wly-arrived emigrants are liable to be attacked by dysentery
But it is easy to guard against it by taking the following precautions ;
—“ Spare diet, very gentle exercise, using no stimulants, and occa-
sionally taking some laxative medicine.”
Should you happen to arrive in summer, you are likely to be
annoyed by mosquitoes, which have a great partiality for new comers.
If you have brought any money with you, place it as a deposit in your

Should you happen to arrive in summer, you are likely to be
annoyed by mosquitoes, which have a great partiality for new comers.
If you have brought any money with you, place it as a deposit in your


own name in one of the Sydney or Melbourne banks. By so doing
you run no risk; for all of them are joint-stock companies, and
whatever becomes of the shareholders , the depositors are perfectly safe,
even if the whole body of directors were not only to become insol-
vent, but afterwards to run away with all the hank capital. The
failure of a joint-stock bank director does not affect the depositor as
such.
If the sum with which you arrive exceed not £2OO, place it in the
Savings Bank; and, until you gain colonial experience, be not
induced, on seeing what you may consider a good bargain, to lay out
your money. W ait for a time; you will see many such good bargains
offered in this colony.
Immediately on the arrival of a ship with emigrants, a number of
citizens and settlers, or their agents, go on board to hire the people.
I have known several cases in which nearly all the emigrants had
been engaged within forty-eight hours after the government muster,
or inspection of the people, was over. The persons who generally
remain longest disengaged are families consisting partly of very young
children, who, instead of being of any use to the settler, only occupy
the time of the mothers, consume rations, and supply the establishment
with vocal music. The emigrants who are most readily engaged are
single females to act as house-servants. There is often a scramble for
them. The great scarcity of female servants in this colony is owing
chiefly to the readiness with which they get married. A large pro-
portion of the girls that emigrate to Australia are comfortably married
within a twelvemonth of their arrival. No fewer than three female
servants of my own were married within one year. However agree-
able it may be to the girls to get permanently settled, it is doubtless
very inconvenient to families to be thus frequently deprived of good
servants. But there is no remedy for it, except patiently waiting the
arrival of the next emigrant ship ; and hence the necessity of employ-
ing men as general house servants both in Sydney and throughout
the colony.
If you are a tradesman, lose no time in applying for employment
to some respectable masters carrying on business in your own parti-
cular trade. You can easily find out their address by inquiring of
any old inhabitant, or by glancing over the Sydney Directory, the
loan of which for a few minutes will be freely given to you by any
of our shopkeepers, whom I have always found civil and obliging. In
case you have a wife and family, and intend remaining in town, your
best plan is to engage by the week a small cottage, which can be had,

case you have a wife and family, and intend remaining in town, your
best plan is to engage by the week a small cottage, which can be had,


in the outskirts of the town, at about 7s. or Bs. of weekly rent; hut
if you are living in single blessedness, you and some of your fellow-
passengers, of congenial dispositions, ought to engage a small cottage
between you. Each of you might then live comfortably at about 10s.
a-week, and save at least 20s. a-week.
If your attention is directed towards rural affairs, I would advise
you to remove yourself and family (if you have any), with all con-
venient speed, into the country, where you can live at little or no
expense. Before commencing on your own account, or making any
purchases of either land or live stock, acquire colonial experience.
Believe me, the time spent in thus acquiring experience is not lost,
even if it should he a couple of years.
Whether your intention is to settle as an agriculturist or as a
sheep and cattle proprietor, you would do well to acquire some colo-
nial experience before embarking in any speculation whatever, no
matter what your previous experience may be. The knowledge thus
acquired will amply compensate for the time which you would per-
haps call lost. The intending agriculturist or grazier would after-
wards find it of immense advantage, if he were to serve, even without
wages, a few months’ apprenticeship as overseer on some large estab-
lishment in the country. Such a practical training would enable him
to avoid many grievous mistakes committed by new comers, and
qualify him for successfully managing his own affairs. In our gene-
ral system of agriculture or tillage, as well as in the selection,
purchase, and management of live stock, the newly-arrived emigrant
has much to learn, which he could not possibly have learnt either
from the best written books on the subject, or from practical experi-
ence in Great Britain.
Whatever may be the amount of your capital, whether large or
small, or whatever may be your views or profession, guard against
entering into partnership with any, unless you have well known for
years your partner or partners, and are fully satisfied not only as to
their solvency, but as to their moral character, economy, prudence,
and general business habits.
Emigrants who are in quest of situations as superintendents, over-
seers, clerks, tutors, store-keepers, &c., ought to advertise in the
Sydney or Melbourne newspapers. There are always some live stock
proprietors, merchants, private gentlemen, and speculators, who are
in want of persons of the above description; and in a rapidly-rising
colony like Australia, there are new openings for young and active
men continually occurring.

I must now warn you that very few persons, on their first arrival
in any new colony, relish their situation. The transition is too vio-
lent. They feel themselves as if cast helpless and abandoned on a
foreign shore: and hence many individuals, if they had only the
means, would gladly retrace their steps, without giving the colony a
fair trial. Guard, on your arrival, against this general feeling of
gloom and despondency. Doubtless you will here meet some faint-
hearted people who see a lion in the path wherever they go, and who,
like the spies sent by Moses to view the land of Canaan, would throw
every obstacle in the way of emigrants. It seems the family of the
Croakers were as numerous then as they are now, and you can con-
fidently say to them, as Caleb, on that most critical occasion said to
the disheartened Israelites, “ Let us go up at once, and possess it;
for we are well able to overcome it.”
I am clearly of opinion that it is owing partly to the difficulty of
returning home from Australia that many emigrants have to attribute
their great success. The immense distance which separates them
from their native land is unquestionably an advantage. For, per-
ceiving the .difficulty of returning home, they are the more prepared
and determined to make the best of their time here; and thus, like an
army driven to desperation, are ready to encounter difficulties and face
opposition, from which, if they saw any easy mode of retreat, they
would instantly make their escape. In your great distance, therefore,
you ought to see the strongest stimulant to activity, rather than any
just cause for dejection.
If you have taken the trouble of reading all that I have written in
this volume for your guidance, you ought to have some idea of this
colony,—of its resources and inhabitants, I have only one more
advice to offer you ; it is an advice which you may perhaps consider
to be out of place, to be uncalled for and unnecessary in a work of this
kind; but, notwithstanding, it is an advice which I consider myself
bound as a Christian to offer.
In Australia you will probably meet several persons who neither
fear God nor regard man, and who will make every effort to gain you
over to their own views. This will be the test to try the strength of
your moral and religious principles; and this will be the time for you
to show the difference between genuine and spurious Christianity, by
exhibiting in your own conduct th % practical effects of those lessons of
heavenly wisdom, which you have been early taught by your parents,
teachers, and ministers. In the midst of abounding iniquity it is, no
doubt, difficult for a Christian to hold fast his integrity, while the
