? CuthberV?would have met
!44S|
29 DEC 1941


| INCE upon a time there was a little
green caterpillar and his name was
Cuthbert. Cuthbert lived with his mummy in a neat little
red and yellow cottage with a thatched roof and flowers
beside the door.
The cottage was made from a fallen apple and lay in the
long grass at the bottom of the orchard.
Cuthbert thought it great fun living in an apple, because,
if he was hungry and his mummy wasn?t looking, he could
just nibble a piece from one of the walls.
Now one bright, sunny morning, Mrs. Caterpillar gave
Cuthbert a basket and asked him to go to the farm across
the meadows to get some butter and eggs from the
farmer?s w T ife.
?Be as quick as you can,? said Mrs. Caterpillar; ?and
don?t stop to talk or play on the way.?
Then she kissed him ?good-bye,? and little Cuthbert
trotted away swinging the basket.




,v
But Cuthbert, I am sorry to say, was not a very obedient
little caterpillar, and although his mummy had told him
to hurry, he thought it would be much more fun if he
took a stroll along the lane instead of going straight
across the fields to the farmhouse.
There had been rain in the night and the lane that
morning was very damp and puddley, and Cuthbert had
been warned ever so many times against getting his feet
wet.


But he didn?t care !
He even splashed his feet through several puddles to show
he didn?t care.
He peered and pried into all the bushes by the wayside in
the hope of finding a ladybird?s nest; and when he met Willy
Waterbeetle going fishing, he stopped to talk to him for
ever so long.

SO it was quite late before he reached the
end of the lane by the sign post, where
you could climb over a stile and follow a twisty path all
the way to the farmhouse.
And when he got there whom should he meet but Wilfred
the Wasp.
Wilfred looked as if he were about to start on a journey
for he was carrying a bundle tied in a red hankie, and
using a small branch as a walking stick.
Now Wilfred the Wasp was not liked by the other insects
because he was always doing something mischievous and
annoying, and Cuthbert had been extra specially told by
his mummy that he was never, never to play with Wilfred.
?Hello,? said Wilfred the Wasp, as he caught sight of
Cuthbert. ?Where are you off to, this fine spring
morning??
?I?m just going to the farm for some butter and eggs,?
replied Cuthbert the Caterpillar.


THAT'S a silly sort of thing to be doing,?
remarked Wilfred. ?Nothing dashing or
adventurous about it. Now 7 ?m going off to see the world
and make my fortune. Fm tired of this stuffy old place,
anyway. Why not come with me??
?Fd like to come, too,? said Cuthbert; ?but Fm afraid
my mummy wouldn't let me go.?
?Then why bother about asking her?? Wilfred replied.
?Just think how proud and happy she?d be when you came
back with a fine fortune in your pocket.?
As I said before, Cuthbert was a naughty little caterpillar;
and he began to think it would be a fine thing to see the
world and make his fortune.
?Is it very far?? he asked Wilfred the Wasp.
?Oh, just over the next hill but two, I believe,? replied
wicked Wilfred. ?Come along if you?re coming; I can?t
waste all this fine morning waiting for you.?

So Cuthbert the Caterpillar forgot all about the butter
and eggs, and said he would come too.
Together they set off along the dusty high road.
As they went along Wilfred explained to Cuthbert just
how easy it was to make a fortune if you were only
adventurous enough.
The first thing you did was to make your way to the
sea; then you got a ship of some kind?the bigger and
faster the ship was, of course, the better ?and then you
became a fierce pirate, and after that your fortune was
*Va as good as made ?
IV
t ?But what does a
pirate do?? asked
Cuthbert.
\ ?
Cuthbert.
?Dear me! How dull
you are!? exclaimed
Wilfred fretfully.
?That?s just what
Fve been telling you,
isn?t it? He makes
his fortune.?


I HIS was not a very satisfactory kind of
"*? reply, and Cuthbert was still puzzling
over it when, presently, they came to a bridge across a
swiftly running stream and stopped to drop a few stones
into the water.
?Aha!? exclaimed Wilfred the Wasp so suddenly that
Cuthbert, who had been leaning over the bridge to watch
his last stone go ?plop? into the stream, nearly fell after
it in his surprise.
?What did you want to do that for?? he asked, rather
crossly.
But Wilfred the Wasp wasn?t taking any notice of him.
He was pointing excitedly down the stream to where a
dark object was half-hidden among some rushes.
?If my eyes do not deceive me, friend Caterpillar,? he
cried, ?that is a boat, and we can start being pirates and
making our fortunes right away.?

Sure enough, when they had scrambled down from the
bridge and clambered along the edge of the stream, they
found that it was a boat. It didn?t look very big or
very fast, but Wilfred said that didn?t matter so much
because they?d very soon capture a faster and better one.
?Now then, my lad, look lively!? cried Wilfred. ?Let?s
get her into the water, and then yo-ho for a pirate life.?
?But don?t you think we?d better ask the owner if he
minds us taking his boat?? asked Cuthbert.
?What a silly idea!? scoffed Wilfred. ?Pirates never
ask people if they can do things?they just do them.?
He gave Cuthbert the oars and told him to row T .


D*
Little Cuthbert tugged hard at the oars, while Wilfred
settled comfortably in the stern.
They had not gone far before they heard a great shouting
from the bank behind them, and looking towards the
sound, saw an elderly beetle running after them waving
his arms in a most indignant manner.
?That must be the owner of the boat/? said Cuthbert.
?Do you think we should row back and see what he
wants??
?Certainly not!? Wilfred answered. ?He?s only waving
us ?good-bye.? Pull harder and try not to splash quite
so much, you?ve half-filled the boat with water already.?

| ?m not splashing,? explained Cuthbert.
'?The water keeps coming in through that
hole in the floor.?
?Hole?? cried the Wasp. ?What hole? Where??
Cuthbert pointed to a large crack in the bottom of the boat
through which the water came spraying in a perfect foun-
tain. ?I thought you knew it was there,? he said.
?Of course, I didn?t? shouted Wilfred. ?Quick, quick!
we?re sinking! Pull for the opposite bank as hard as you
can!?
Cuthbert pulled his hardest, and Wilfred seized the
empty basket which Cuthbert had been carrying and tried
to bail out the water with it. But it was no good. The
boat sank lower and lower in the water and seemed to get
heavier and heavier, until with a sad ?scrunch? it settled
on the bottom of the stream.
Fortunately the water was not very deep, and the two
naughty insects were able to scramble to the shore, Wilfred
holding his red bundle high out of the water to keep it dry.


I HERE you are,? said Wilfred, shaking
* the water out of his tall hat. ?Now you
know how to cross a dangerous river.?
Cuthbert couldn?t help thinking that if crossing the stream
was all that Wilfred wanted to do, it would have been
easier and less damp to have just walked across the bridge.
But before he could point this out, Wilfred was hurrying
away again towards a neat little cottage of straw which
he could see behind some bushes not very far away.
When Cuthbert caught up with him, he was standing in
the middle of the road, sniffing.
?Honey,? said he. ?I smell HONEY!?
?I think that?s Mrs. Honeybee?s cottage,? said Cuthbert;
?but I can?t smell any honey.?
?You could if you had a decent nose,? Wilfred replied.
?I?m going to have a look round. I could just enjoy a spot
of honey for lunch.?
He buzzed away over the hedge and landed softly close
to the cottage. On a bench beside the door were two large
honey-pots; but there was no sign of Mrs. Honeybee.
Quickly seizing a pot under each arm, Wilfred the Wasp
flew back over the hedge.

?Come on, we must hurry,? said
Wilfred as he set off along the road
at a very fast pace.
Poor little Cuthbert pattered after
him as fast as he could trot.
The day began to get hotter and
hotter, and the high road seemed
dustier and dustier and Cuthbert
the Caterpillar was getting hungrier and thirstier each
minute.
?Couldn?t we have lunch now?? he asked. But Wilfred
said ?not yet?; and hurried on faster than ever, using
his wings.
Cuthbert wished very much that he
had been born with a pair of wings,
as he puffed and panted up a long-
steep hill.With each step, Wilfred the
Wasp left him further and further
behind,until, at last, all that Cuthbert
could see of him was a tiny yellow
speck at the top of the hill.


WHEN, at last, Cuthbert reached the top
of the hill, he found Wilfred sitting in
the shade of a leafy tree with a honey-pot between his
knees, and fanning himself gently with his hat. Beside
him was one of the honey-pots already empty.
?You?ve been a long time getting here,? he said to Cuthbert.
?I thought old mother Honeybee had caught you. What?ll
you have for lunch??
?What is there?? asked Cuthbert.
?I may be able to spare you a drop of this honey,? mumbled
Wilfred with his mouth full.
?I don?t like honey,? explained Cuthbert.
agree with me.?
?It doesn?t
?Good!? said Wilfred. ?All the more for me! You?d better
take a stroll and see if you can find a lettuce patch or
something.? He licked the last traces of honey from the
pot and started on the bread and cheese he had carried
in the red handkie.
?I do like bread and cheese,? said Cuthbert; but Wilfred
the Wasp pretended not to hear.

So Cuthbert the Caterpillar started off through the hedge
to see if he could find something for lunch. He began
to wish that he was at home so that he could have nibbled
a piece off one of the walls.
But home was very far away, and although he peered to
this side and to that he could not see anything that
looked at all like a lettuce patch.
Just to make quite sure about it, he tasted several kinds
of leaves; but none of them seemed to be at all like
lettuces.

This one was too sour and that one was too bitter; and,
nibbling here and there as he went, Cuthbert gradually
wandered some distance from the trees in the shade of
which Wilfred was by this time peacefully sleeping after
his lunch.
Then, just as he was deciding that he would never find
anything to eat, Cuthbert turned a corner and came
across a little patch of juicy-leaved plants which tasted
simply delicious.


I I i/

WITH a little sigh of contentment he
settled down to enjoy the lunch he so
much needed
Now one juicy leaf leads to another when a caterpillar is
hungry, and Cuthbert quite forgot how time was flying
as he nibbled and nibbled away, until, Fm sorry to say,
he was visibly bulging in several places.
Suddenly he heard a rustle in the grass stems above him,
and looked up to see the terrible Mrs. Duck glaring down
upon him.
?Well, well!? said Mrs. Duck. ?If it isn?t a nice juicy
caterpillar! Now, isn?t that lucky!?
Cuthbert was terrified and started to shout loudly: ?Help!
Help! Murder! Thieves! HELUP!?
So loud were his cries that they wakened Wilfred from
his nap, and he came buzzing over the hedge to find out
what was the matter. When he saw Cuthbert in Mrs.
Duck?s bill, he flew into her face, stinging her so hard
that she dropped Cuthbert hurriedly and made off down
the hill quacking loudly and ruffling all her feathers.


AFTER chasing Mrs. Duck until he was
quite out of breath, Wilfred came back
to Cuthbert and bandaged his bruised sides with the red
hankie in which he had carried the bread and cheese. Then
he fanned him with his hat until he felt better.
?There?s an exciting looking village over the hill,? he told
Cuthbert. ?Shall we go on now??
?I-I?d rather go home,? said Cuthbert.
?Pooh, Nonsense!? scoffed Wilfred. ?I believe you?re
frightened.?
?I?m not,? said Cuthbert bravely; and set off down the
hill towards the village, just to show he wasn?t.
?Vm not frightened of anything ,? boasted Wilfred. ?Of
course I?ve got wings, but I?d never use them to fly away
from danger. I like danger!?
Just then they came to the village; and w T hom should they
meet but Mrs. Honeybee. With her was Policeman Stag-
beetle. No sooner did Mrs. Honeybee catch sight of Wilfred
than she began to scream loudly:
?There he is ! The wicked thief who stole my beautiful
honey. I saw him through my little window stealing my
beautiful, beautiful honey !?

oki
Only a few villagers were left
behind, and they were watching
the chase and listening to the
cries of ?Stop thief!? growing-
fainter in the distance. No one
noticed Cuthbert as he softly
crept away in the opposite
direction.
?Now then ?? began Policeman
Stagbeetle.
But for all his boasting, Wilfred
wasn't ready to face this dan-
ger. Without caring what
might happen to Cuthbert, he
opened out his wings and fled.
?Stop thief!? cried Mrs. Honey-
bee, buzzing after Wilfred.
Stop thief!?
?Stop thief!
shouted Policeman Stagbeetle,
dashing after her.
?Stop thief ! Stop thief !
STOP THIEF r cried other
villagers joining in the chase.


HEN Cuthbert the Caterpillar was well
* * away from the village, he started to run,
and ran,
and ran,
and ran,
until he was quite out of breath and didn?t know where
he was. In his haste, Wilfred?s red handkie had come
untied and fallen off but he hadn?t stopped to pick it up.
Presently he found his way into a tidy vegetable garden.
It was pleasantly cool, and he decided to have a rest
under a shady lettuce leaf. So curling himself up com-
fortably he was soon fast asleep.
Suddenly he was wakened by the sound of footsteps close
beside him; and, peeping out from under his leaf, he saw
a gardener poking about among the leaves of the lettuces.
?They cattypillys be a pest,? muttered Mr. Higgins, the
gardener, to himself as he poked among the leaves. ?I?ll
get rid of ?em, if I have to catch they one by one.?
Cuthbert shivered, and tried to hide himself behind his
shady leaf. But Mr. Higgins soon had him out of that.

?A-ha! Another of they
little pests!? cried Mr. Higgins.
Poor Cuthbert gave himself up for lost, and wished very
much that he had never met Wilfred the Wasp and run
away from home to see the World.
Mr. Higgins was just beginning to squeeze the life out
of Cuthbert, when from the distance the voice of Mrs.
Higgins was heard calling to her husband to come to his
dinner.
Mr. Higgins was a greedy old man, and he was in such
a hurry to go to his dinner that he forgot to go on
squeezing Cuthbert, and flung him over the fence instead.

falling !
� ? *
Cuthbert found himself
Sometimes he fell head first;
sometimes feet foremost . . .
And sometimes he just went round and round in the air.
He wondered whether Wilfred the Wasp
ever felt at all like this when he was
flying with his wings; but decided that
he probably didn?t.
Then he began to
wonder if he would
ever stop falling.
He was just think-
ing how very awk-
ward it would be if
he had to spend the
rest of his life this
way when there
was a great BUMP!


EXCUSE me,? remarked a hoarse voice
beside him, ?but would you mind re-
moving yourself from the butter??
Cuthbert opened his eyes and found himself staring into
the large round spectacles of an elderly lizard.
?The butter!? went on the lizard impatiently. ?You?re
lying all over it. Would it be troubling you too much to
ask you to move over a trifle??
Cuthbert scrambled out of the butter dish, and looked
about him. He found he was in Mr. Lizard?s rather
gloomy parlor. At first he wondered how he got there;
but the big BUMP and a hole in Mr. Lizard?s roof seemed
to explain it.
Mr. Lizard looked at the hole and then at Cuthbert.
?Very careless,? he grumbled. ?Very careless indeed!
There wasn?t a better roof in these parts till you came
jumping on it. Not to mention the butter you?ve ruined.
What do you want??
?I-I don?t want anything, th-thank you,? stammered Cuth-
bert, who was feeling rather shaky after his treatment
by old Mr. Higgins.


l V -


?T
DON?T remember asking you to drop in,?
said Mr. Lizard. ?You aren?t the Rates
and Taxes, are you?? he added suspiciously.
?No,? replied Cuthbert.
?Nor the Gas and Water?? asked Mr. Lizard.
Cuthbert assured him that he wasn?t the Gas and Water.
?Then who are you?? asked Mr. Lizard.
?I?m Cuthbert the Caterpillar and I?ve lost my way, and
I want my mummy, and I want to go ho-o-ome!? said poor
little Cuthbert bursting into tears.
?Tut-tut! Come, come!? exclaimed Mr. Lizard. ?This won?t
do, you know! Dear, dear!?
He began to mop up Cuthbert?s tears with his table napkin.
He was so busy comforting the little caterpillar that he
failed to notice a mournful procession which passed his
house at that moment.
First came Policeman Stagbeetle, waving his truncheon
and looking very pleased with himself, while he led by a
chain Wilfred the Wasp, very muddy and sorry for himself.
Mrs. Honeybee, buzzed excitedly round, occasionally prod-
ding Wilfred with a stick.
It looked as if the wicked adventures of Wilfred the Wasp
were at an end.

When Cuthbert felt better, he told Mr. Lizard all about
the apple cottage, and how he was trying to find his way
back to it.
Mr. Lizard didn?t know the apple cottage, himself:
?But I?ve got a cousin living down by the pond,? he said.
?He?s travelled a lot and may have heard of it. We?ll
go and see him.?
Mr. Lizard?s cousin was an elderly Frog who spent most
of his days fishing from a lily leaf and practising his
scales. They could hear him singing quite a long way off.


GOOD afternoon, cousin Frog,? called
Lizard.
?Doh-re-me-fah ?good afternoon cousin Lizard?soh-la-te-
doh!? croaked Mr. Frog. ?And what brings you here this
bright afternoon? tra-la-la-la!?
Mr. Lizard told him.
?Loo-100-100-loo,? hummed Mr. Frog reflectively, and
scratched his head That didn?t seem to help very much,
so he sang several scales very beautifully, and stared hard
at Cuthbert.
?Where did you say this cottage was?? he asked at last.
?At the foot of the last tree in the orchard.?
?What orchard?? asked Mr. Frog.
Cuthbert looked at him blankly. He didn?t know there
was more than one orchard in the world.
?Just our orchard,? he replied.
?That?s silly,? said Mr. Frog sulkily. ?How should I
know which is your orchard? Why not take him along to
old Policeman Stagbeetle, Lizard old man? You?re inter-
rupting my practising terribly, you know.?
Just then Mr. Mole poked his head out of the bank above.
?What is all the fuss?? he asked peevishly.
Mr. Frog and Lizard began to explain together.

?Please, please, please!?
interrupted Mole. ?One
at a time if you don?t
mind. I gather that this
?ah? grub, is lost??
?Yes,? said Frog and
Lizard together.
?And you don?t know
what to do with it??
?Yes,? said Lizard and
Frog again.
?Pooh !? said Mole.
?That?s easy! Keep him
till there?s a REWARD
offered for him.?
?Wonderful idea!? said
Frog.
?How do you do it, Mole??
said Lizard.
?Oh, just brains,? said
Mole modestly. ?Glad to
be of help.? And he
popped back into his hole.
?Where?ll we keep him??
asked Frog.
?I could take him home,? said Lizard;
?but there?s a hole in the roof and he
might get out.? ?Let?s tie him to a bullrush till
they come along with that reward,? Frog suggested.


?Splendid idea, Frog!? chuckled Lizard
only one with brains.?
?Mole?s not the
Mr. Frog didn?t reply, but sang a modest scale.
So poor little Cuthbert the Caterpillar was firmly tied to
a clump of rushes where Frog could keep an eye on him
from his lily leaf, while Lizard went home to mend the
hole that Cuthbert had made in his roof.
Cuthbert struggled and struggled to try and get out of the
tight grass blades which bound him; but the more he
struggled the tighter
they seemed to grow.
Out on his lily leaf,
Frog was once more
fishing. His back
was towards Cuth-
bert, and he prac-
tised his scales more
and more drowsily.
Gradually the scales
got softer and softer
until they ceased
altogether, and, in-
stead, there came the
sound of a long snore
?Mr. Frog had gone
to sleep.


' s.


THEN, along the path beside the pond and
round a corner came Willy Waterbeetle
returning from his fishing. He came along very, very
slowly.
?Willy! Willy Waterbeetle!? cried Cuthbert very softly
for fear of waking Frog.
Willy stopped and peered all round him. Mr. Frog choked
in the middle of a snore, stirred restlessly, and then fell
into a deeper slumber. Then Willy Waterbeetle saw
Cuthbert.
?What are you doing there?? he asked
?Don?t waste time asking questions,? pleaded Cuthbert.
?Help me to get away quickly!?
Just as Willy was untying the last knot, Mr. Frog awoke
with a start, and looked over towards the clump of rushes.
When he saw what was happening, he gave a croak of rage
and plunged into the pond and started swimming towards
the shore.
?Quick!? cried Willy Waterbeetle. ?Run for your life!?


TOGETHER they dashed for safety in
some long grass and bushes which grew
beside the pond, and by the time Mr. Frog had scrambled
ashore, they were well out of sight.
Willy and Cuthbert pushed their way through the bushes
until they thought they must be safe, then they sat down
to rest and listen.
Then Cuthbert told Willy all that had happened since he
had left home that morning, and how much he wished
that he had never met Wilfred the Wasp at all.
But they were both so frightened of meeting Frog or Mr.
Lizard that it was not until the moon was getting up over
the hill that they set out through the hedge and across
the field for home.
When they were half way across the field they saw a
lot of little twinkley lights in the distance. As they came
closer they could see that these lights were lanterns and
torches carried by all the insects who had come to help
Mrs. Caterpillar search for Cuthbert.






M RS. Caterpillar was sobbing bitterly.
?Fm sure he?s fallen into that nasty
pond and been drowned!? she cried over and over again.
?No, I haven?t!? shouted Cuthbert, and, leaving Willy
Waterbeetle, he rushed across the field to his mummy?s
side.
When she heard Cuthbert?s voice, Mrs. Caterpillar stopped
crying and laughed with joy instead.
And everybody was so happy and pleased at his safe return
that they quite forgot to scold Cuthbert for having given
them all such a fright.
They made a fuss of Willy Waterbeetle, too, and told him
what a clever insect he was to have found the missing
caterpillar, which pleased Willy Waterbeetle very much.
And ever afterwards, Cuthbert was such a good little
caterpillar that he was the pride of his mummy?s heart.


TH E/ END
But wicked Wilfred the Wasp was sent to prison for
stealing Mrs. Honeybee?s honey; and Mr. Frog suffered
from rheumatism after hunting for Cuthbert in his wet
clothes; and Mr. Lizard caught a cold in the head from
the draught coming through his ceiling; and Mr. Higgins
had bad indigestion through bolting his dinner; and Mr.
Mole had nightmare?
Which served them all right
