COLOURED MOTTLED
ENAMEL FUEL STOVES
IN GREEN, BLUE OR GREY.
THE NEW ATTRACTIVE FINISH.
This new MOTTLED ENAMEL Finish has a pleasing appearance, which always
looks cool and at the same time will tone with any colour scheme. It has a highly
glazed surface that in ordinary domestic use may be termed ever-lasting, and will
not chip or craze.
It is easily kept clean: an occasional rub with a damp cloth is all that is
necessary.
This finish effectively seals the metal from moisture, thus preventing the
formation of rust.

THE NEW 5 FUEL STOVE
WITH PORCELAIN ENAMELLED FRONT AND
NICKEL-PLATED MOUNTINGS.
Illustrating White Porcelain Enamel and Nickel-plated Finish.
The “ EMPRESS ” Fuel Stove has been specially designed for country use. It
has a very deep Fire-box that will take wood 17 ins. long in No. 1 size, and 20 ins.
long in No. 2 size. The Fire Grate is composed of single bars, and the Fire Cheeks
can be replaced when required.
The Oven is extremely large. This will be found a great advantage in country
districts.
The Stove is constructed of Steel, which prevents damage in transit, and also
prevents cracking with the heat.
The new Porcelain finishes are so easily cleaned. A rub with a damp cloth
occasionally is all that is required.
Note the strong Nickel-plated Cast-iron Door Frame, Positive Catch and heavy
Door Hinges, which adequately support the door when open.

THE “REGIMA” STOVE.

See Page 1 for Mottled Enamel Finish.
Note. —The “ Regina ” Stove can only be supplied in Grey Mottled Enamel. Blue and
Green not being suitable for this type of Stove.
Please note: Short and Elevated Legs are interchangeable.
This popular Stove is now improved, and we draw attention to the Damper
Rod, which is enclosed in the body to prevent damage in transit. Also the improved
Door Catch, etc.
The body of the Stove is constructed of the best quality wrought sheet steel of
heavy gauge for its strength, and in order to conserve the heat generated we have
double cased this around the oven, packing the space between the casing with clay
silicate of special mixture, and so obtaining as equal a heat in the oven as can possibly
be obtained in a stove set in brickwork. It is constructed to burn long wood
economically. The cast-iron parts are made extra heavy, and the whole combination,
as will be seen by the above illustration, gives a good appearance as well as a
thoroughly efficient article.
Stove supplied with Lifter, Raker, and Flue Brush.
8 ft. of 554 in. Flue Pipe is necessary for correct draught.
When ordering Flue Pipe only for this Stove, please state Number of Stove and
whether bottom length is required.

warming cabinet, and is for convenience when firing with wood and
for cleaning out fire box.
A large capacity ash pan is provided, which is so constructed that the
filling of same with ash does not in any way interfere with the draught.

CONTINUOUS BURNING
HEATING STOVE
NOW MADE IN TWO SIZES.
In appreciation of the increasing demand for an attractive Heating Stove suitable
for the Lounge or Dining Room of the present-day home, and one requiring the
minimum of attention, METTERS LTD. now present the “ KOSI ” Continuous
Burning Stove.
This Stove burns ordinary small coke, ami is very economica], approximately
twelve pounds of fuel being sufficient for twelve hours’ burning. The “ KOSI ”
is clean in operation, absolutely no soot, ash or dust can enter the room from
the lire box.
The room is heated by circulation of the air_ over the extensive radiating surface
at back of Stove, the frets at side and top allowing the air to circulate. The actual
fumes from fire cannot possibly enter the room, as the fire box is sealed.
The “ KOSI ” can be installed in front of Register Grate, or can be built into
a brick or tile surround. It is also suitable for rooms without fireplace.
Supplied in various finishes (see Price List), and with Cast-iron Elbow
Extension Piece and 5-inch Flue Pipe extra.

The Stove is Fine Cast and dressed
before Black Leading. All Handles, Knobs,
etc., are Nickel-plated.
Mottled Enamel Finish.—
The whole of Stove is Mottled Enam-
elled in Red. Brown. Green, Blue or
W alnut.
This permanent rust-proof finish will
not chip or craze with the heat and is
easily cleaned with an occasional rub with
a damp cloth. Fittings are Nickel-plated.
Satin Nickel-plated Finish.—

even surface and then Nickel-plated.
FUEL HODS
The Fuel Hod is the cleanest and most con-
venient method of replenishing the fuel in a
“ KOSI ” Stove or Register Grate.
It dispenses with a shovel and coal box,
which is, at its best, an unsightly combination.
Supplied in Bright Black finish or Mottled
Enamel to match Stove.

SPUN AND RIVETED COPPERS.
Riveted Coppers.
Spun Seamless Coppers.
ONE-PIECE SPUN SEAMLESS COPPERS.
We have installed a complete and up-to-date plant, which, haying proved
successful, allows us to offer a ONE-PIECE COPPER at a lower price than our
BRAZED COPPER.
As the demand for these SPUN COPPERS has been far greater than the
demand for BRAZED and LIGHT RIVETED COPPERS, we have decided to
discontinue making both the latter.
Spun Coppers are made in three weights
LIGHT, MEDIUM, HEAVY.
The “Light” has been made to meet a demand for a low priced Copper, but we
advise the “Medium” as more serviceable for general use in preference to the “Light.”
Spun Coppers are supplied in from 10 to 20 gallon sizes. Medium and Heavy
Riveted Coppers are supplied in from 10 to 50 gallon sizes.
All Coppers should be crated for country. (See Price List.)
Note.—Unless ordered otherwise, all Coppers will be supplied in these sizes.
If required we can make to order Riveted Coppers to any given diameter and
depth.

METTERS’ PATENT
CORRUGATED TANK FLANGES.
Painted or Galvanised.
The above illustrates the most ser-
viceable principle of attaching service
pipes to an ordinary corrugated tank,
and can be fitted by any handy man.
With an ordinary socket, which has
been soldered into a tank and requires
an expert to place in position, the
area upon which the strain is carried
is very limited, but with these corru-
gated flanges the strain is distributed
over a very large area.

Outside Shell, Black Iron, 20 inches deep.
Inside Receiver, Galvanised Iron, 18 inches deep.
Crating, 2/6 each.
The “ Majestic ” (Underground) Garbage Receiver is idea! for domestic use. it
consists of a heavy water-proof cast-iron cover, with foot operated hinged lid, heavy
sheet iron outer casing or shell, with a removable galvanised iron container with
bail handle.
It is neat and sanitary. Compare the top left-hand illustration, for that is all
that is exposed of the “Majestic” Garbage Receiver, with the usual unsightly, and
very unhygienic, garbage tin, that every prying cat or hungry dog can upset and
strew the contents about, a veritable breeding ground for bacteria, and feeding ground
for flies, etc.
The “Majestic” (Underground) Garbage Receiver can be installed by simply
digging a hole to accommodate the outer casing in any convenient position, at the
kitchen door (as it is water and odor-proof), or convenient to the entrance for handy
access to the garbage collector.
