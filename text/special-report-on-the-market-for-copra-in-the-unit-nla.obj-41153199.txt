AVERAGE ANNUAL CONSUMPTION OF THE PRODUCTS OF
COPRA IN THE UNITED STATES. CANADA AND MEXICO.
4 * It will be observed that the average annual
consumption of Copra in the three countries named,
may be computed as being approximately as follows
viz: - ,
<>pra and Products In terms of Long Tons of Conra

The Unitec States imports are constituted in part
of Copra and in part of both crude and refined
oil (vide Schedule 1 and 2 attached hereto). The
Canadian importations are entirely in the form of
Oil (mostly crude oil), Mexican imports are largely
of Copra. it has been difficult to obtain authentic
information respecting Mexico and it may be necessary
to vary the above mentioned estimate of Mexican re-
quirements after further investigation.

8. It is suggested in the trade that the location of the
plants of greatest capacity on the Pacific Coast is due to
several factors, including;
(a) The established trade with the Philippine Islands
and convenience of handling importations from
these Islands at Pacific Coast points.
(b) The market for oil cake and meal which has been
developed in the stock raising and dairying
territories in the western and middle western
states which can be conveniently reached from
Pacific Coast points, and
(c) Economy in transporting oil in bulk railroad cars
across the continent
The copra crushing facilities are over-expanded in
the United States and greatly in excess of American re-
quirements of Cocoanut oil. On the other hand there is
not enough cake and meal produced on the Pacific Coast of
U.S.A. to meet the demand. Importations from the Philippine
Islands are required. In the Eastern states of the United
States there are such large supplies of Linseed meal avail-
able that the demand for Copra meal is limited. The main
market for oil as shown later herein is through the soap
makers, the latter being principally located in the East
and to a lesser extent in the middle west of U.S.A., while
the meat packing industry, principally located in Chicago,
uses edible oil in the production of shortenings, etc.


>ACK OF COPRA EXPRESSING PLANTS IN CANADA
9. Up to the present, no oil-expressing plants using
Copra as a raw material have been established in Canada,
Soap manufacturing in Canada is principally located in
Eastern Canada. There is some difference of opinion as to
the most suitable location in Canada for an oil-expression
plant. Some of the Canadian soap manufacturers maintain
that the existence of oil-expression plants on the Pacific
Coast of U.S.A. is rendered profitable in part by the con-
venience at Pacific Coast ports of shipping facilities from
the Philippine Islands. It is contended, however, that
another very important consideration is that a large market
for meal is available in the Pacific Coast states of U.S.A.
On the other hand, British Columbia interests discount these
views and favour the port of Vancouver as a suitable loca-
tion. Hitherto, Canadian soap manufacturers and meat packers
appear to have been satisfied to purchase Cocoanut Oil from
V?sj; rect sour ces of supply at world values. There is some
aillerence of opinion in Canada as to the desirability of
undertaking oil-expression on a substantial scale and also,
as to the best location.
NEW VANCOUVER OIL EXPRESSION PLANT BEING ERECTED
I�. Steps were recently taken by Sir Walter Carpenter of
Messrs. W. \ Carpenter & Co. Ltd., of Sydney (Australia)
to establish an oil crushing plant at Vancouver, B.C. This
plant is being erected on a site contiguous to the Feed
Elevator of E.Buckerfield, Ltd. It is understood that
Messrs. Buckerfield will distribute the meal from the new
plant. No definite arrangements appear to have been made
with respect to sources of raw material (Copra) or as to
?i^ r i butlon �� tbe resultant oil. It is assumed locally
that Messrs. W. n. Carpenter & Co. will endeavour to use
the new Vancouver plant as an exclusive outlet for New
Guinea and Pacific Copra controlled by their firm.
Some approaches have been made by the Vancouver promoters
to Eastern Canadian oil users with respect to distribution
of the cocoanut oil from the new plant, but without final-
ity up to the present. It is understood that the new Van-
couyer piant will absorb 18,000 tons of Copra annually and
anat it will be ready to operate early in 1941.
PROPOSED CRUSHING PLANT IN EASTERN CANADA
10.(a) It is believed also that Unilevers and some other
Eastern Canadian interests are at time of writing looking
into the question of installing oil expressing equipment to
handle Copra in Eastern Canada. An alternative being con-
sidered in this connection is that equipment in Eastern
Canada at present being used to express oil from Soya Beans
and other raw material might be adapted to treat copra. It
is doubtful whether a regular market for meal or cake has
been established in Canada and steps to build up either a
loca! or export market for this by-product may be necessary.
Newfoundland is also being considered by Unilevers as a
possible location for a copra crushing plant intended to
cater to Eastern Canadian requirements.
MEXICAN DEMAND
11. Reference is made to the normal importation of
Copra into Mexico. It should be stated that some Copra is
produced in Mexico itself, on a narrow strip on the Eastern
Coast. Because of lack of adequate transport facilities
across Mexico from East to West, this local production of
the East is not available to the central and western con-
suming areas. Consequently, there is the apparent para-
dox of domestic production of Copra in the East, with the
necessity for importation in the West. The Copra produced
in the Eastern part of the country is either used locally
or transported north to the U.S.A. The principal crushing
plants are located in West Central Mexico, in which local-
ity there are four principal plants. There is one sub-
stantial plant near Mexico City and a number of smaller
users in other parts of the country. American importers of

thirty days sight for 95$ of invoice, based on quantity
snipped, with final settlement after outturn weights have
been ascertained. Offers are usually received or transmitter
by American importers of specified quantities of Copra of a

CURRENT VALUES OF COPRA AMD CRUDE COCOANUT PIT,
P F�f s on the N �rth American market are to a consider-
Isi�nds ten Thfc V ?F eCi K y ,T SI K eS of Copra from the Philippine
islands. This is probably because of the large volume of
ential�tariff 111 PB f� ppine Co P rG resulting from the prefer-
thoPhJF f c ? n ? lt i� ns granted by the U.S. in favour of
emher h tcnq P rv! IslEn ? s - About the outbreak of War, in Sept-
ember 1939, Copra values were about 2-1/40 ner lb., and
De/lOO^bs ool^ 5? arch fu 194 � v,hen Prices reached $1.60
pei iU(J lbs. At that time there was an advance in oce^n
freights, which made the price $1.70 per 100 lbs. The fol-
lowing ligures denote the trend of prices on the North
American market from May to October 1940 at per 100 lbs.viz:

All of these prices are C.I.F. Pacific Coast ports, in bulk

In September 1939 Crude Cocoanut Oil. was selling at about
4 cents per lb. whereas at Ist October, 1940 the value would
?in. cenp� pcr lp * Edible oil would sell at from five-
eighths to three quarters of a cent higher than inedible oil
The margin between crude and refined, oil naturally~?changd's
according to the higher or lower value of crude oil. At time
of higher values there is a greater monetary loss 'in refining.
Manilla Copra is regarded in the American trade as being in-
lenor to the copra from the Netherlands Indies. South Sea
Island Copra is considered to be superior to Copra origina-
ting in the Philippine Islands and approximately equivalent
to the quality of Java Copra. Oil expressed in Ceylon is
placed first in quality and superior to Java oil.
UTILIZATION OF COCOANUT OIL IN SOAP MANITFAfV
16. As soap manufacture is the principal outlet for
inedible oil produced from the Southern Pacific some
reference to soap manufacturing in North America is included
in this report. Based on a study by the American Association
of uoap and Glycerine producers, it has been estimated that
soap sales in the United States during the period 1935 to
1938 inclusive increased by a total of 275,000,000 lbs. f or
the four years. A similar increase is believed to have taken
place in Canada. Attached hereto (Schedule 9), is a table
showing the utilization of various fats and oils in
United States soap, manufacture during the period 1931-1938.


It will be noted that during the eight-year period in
question, the consumption of cocoanut oil has remained
practically static while the consumption in palm oil has
declined considerably. Soya bean oil on the other hand
almost trebled in consumption by the American soap in-
dustry _ during the period 1931 to 1938. The soap manu-
facturing trade adopts a policy of some degree of flexibi-
J n � at sele cticn for soap manufacture. It has been
stated, however, that there is no satisfactory substitute
lor cocoanut oil in soap making except palm kernel oil.
ihe superiority of cocoanut oil in manufacturing soar is
accounted ior by its quick-lathering properties which
latter-type of soap is preferred by the modern consumer.
soaps have considerable water softening
properties. The utilization of cocoanut oil in soap
m f� n �? lns s steady bevel in the United States notwith-
i ng the substantial excise tax which might conceiv-
ably have retarded its utilization.
PRINCIPAL SOAP MANUFACTURING PLANTS
Ab schedule 12 is a list of the principal soap
the North Continent,
th! e Mn' tod states and Canadian plants are quite
i-ige, the Mexican plants appear to be much smaller units.
USE OF EDIBLE COCOANUT OIL BY MEAT PACKING INDUSTRY ETC.
nnt In the yaa r d 93 9, 19.4-8 per cent of all cocoa-
-1 L on ? lea iri bbe U.S.A. was used in edible channels.
Important pc-okers state that there are limits as to the
�� ?? coanut oil Vvhich can be used because of the
tendency of the cocoanut oil to w foam? in shortening. There
m� e packing plants throughout North America
Tne lour major organizations in U.S.A. are Swifts, Cudahy
ArmourE and toilsons (Head offices Chicago). A report by ?
the Department of Agriculture in 1938 stated that I the four
large national packers in the United States were then
operating 88 slaughtering plants. Out of a total of be-
tween 800 ana 1,000 slaughtering plants in the United
States 299 were operating under federal inspection. All
of the meat packing plants do not engage in the production
ol shortenings. inis is a bi-product in the more import-
ar*� lfleat packing plants. The hitherto important usage of
edible coconut oil in the United States in the manufactur
oi oleomargarine, is a declining field due to restrict
li? 9 bax legislation in various states of the Union. Undo,
this _ State legislation oleomargarine containing oils of
foreign origin is taxed at a considerably higher rate -the
tnat made from domestic oils. An additional impediment t'
ohe usage of cocoanut oil in oleomargarine or other edibl.
product in the U.S.A. at the present time is the compoti-"
tion of cotton seed oil which sells at a much lower price
than cocoanut oil. Cottonseed oil at the present time is
selling at per pound. Valley points, whereas cocoa
nut oil, excise tax paid, sells at 5-1/4* per pound.
Pacific Coast. *
Another useiul outlet in the usage of cocoanut oil is in
the manufacture of bakers 1 products. In this industry it
is used in the manufacture of certain special kinds of
crackers anu in other products and in the greasing of pens.
The confectioner/ industry uses considerable quantities of
cocoanuo oil stearins which is a substitute for cocoa
butter in the manufacture ol chocolates. In confectionery
production ic is also used in the greasing of pans and in
.further ways of comparatively minor importance. Some cocoa
nut oil is utilized in the preparation of peanuts for sale
oS edible nuts end as a substitute lor butter by popcorn
roasters. 1


19. As regards meat packing in Canada, the more
important plants are located as follows, viz; -
Canada Packers Ltd,,Toronto,Edmonton,Winnipeg,
Calgary,Vancouver,Montreal
Peterborough, Halifax.
Swift (Canadian)Ltd.Toronto,Winnipeg, Vancouver,
Edmonton
Burns & Company

Farmers Cooperative Barrie, (Ont.)
Co.
In addit i-Qn to the above, there are a number of
small plants in different parts of the country.
. Information regarding Canadian utilization of
edible oil is contained at Schedule 6 attached. As regard
the Canadian figures in Schedule 5 it should be observed
that some of the oil shown as being used by meat packers
was utilized in the production of soap in soap manufact-
uring divisions of Canadian meat packing plants.

Under this law it is provided that the tax on Cocoanut
Oil expressed from Philippine Copra is 3 cents per lb.,
whereas Oil expressed from Copra originating from all
other sources is subject to a tax of 3 cents per lb.
This differential tax creates a preferential position
for the Philippine ?Island Copra which is corollary to
the preferential position for the Philippines in respect
to imports of Philippine Cocoanut Oil into U.S.A.
23. The weight of even the 30 per pound processing
tax on cocoanut oil bears heavily on the price of Phili-
ppine copra. It is said that it is difficult to market
Philippine copra in the United States at a profit to the
Philippine producers. Recent prices quoted in the Island,
range around 2.8 pesos per hundred kilos, (1 kilo = 2.20/6
lbs. 1 peso - sOo)This is said to be the lowest price
level that has ever been recorded in the Philippine Islands
and it is claimed is considerably under the cost of pro-
duction. Freight rates on copra .from the Philippine^ Is-
lands to U.&.A. are at present $13.30 per ton. It is
stated that the price of copra cake in the Philippines has
fallen sc low that copra cake is being used for fuel.
The ocean freight on copra cake is $11.30 per ton.
2 4� It should be stated that Proceeds from the U.S.
excise tax on Philippine cocoanut oil are returned in
their entirety to the Philippine Government. The collect-
ions from the tax in the fiscal year ending June 30, 19/0
amountea to seventeen million dollars. This money goes
to the Philippine Treasury. Some copra interests complain
that while the burden of the tax is plainly affecting the
livelihood of the copra producers in the Islands, never-
theless the Philippine Government is not objecting to the
continuance of the United States tax because of the profit
which it derives therefrom. There may, however, be an-
other point of view from the standpoint of the Philippine
Government. It is possible that other considerations
render it difficult for the Philippine authorities to
make representations to the United States.
RATES OF CUSTOMS DUTY IN CANADA
It may be pointed out that under the United Kingdom -
Canada Trade Agreement of 19.32, the United Kingdom and
Colonies were guaranteed duty free entry and a margin of
preference of 10 p.c. on Cocoanut Oil as described in
Canadian Tariff Items 278 and 278 c. Under the Canada-
United Kingdom Agreement of 1937, these items were bound


as "free" but the margin of preference of 10$ ad. val was
preserved only with respect to Item 278. Under the Austr*-
alian-Canadian Trade Agreement of 1931 and its Amendments
the British preferential rate is assured on Cocoanut oil
from Australia and on Copra from Papua but not on Copra
from New Guinea while there are no guaranteed margins of
preference to Australia or its Territories either for
Copra or Cocoanut oil.
26. It should be observed that goods entitled to
entry into Canada under the British Preferential Tariff
are exempt from the War Exchange Tax of 10 p.c. This
tax is, therefore, not applicable to Copra from British
countries, but does apply to all foreign countries.
The value for duty on goods imported from the United
States is also subject to an advance of 11 p.c. on
account of exchange depreciation. This means that if
Copra were imported into Canada for crushing the
additional margin of preference of approximately 21
p.c. would apply over and above the margin of preference
shown in the immediately preceding paragraph. Similarly,
in the case of cocoanut oil processed in a British
country, the additional margins of preference would
obtain. Imports of cocoanut oil (and meal) into
Canada from the United States also bear the added cost
at present of the rate of exchange.
MEXICAN CUSTOMS DUTY
27. The following are the Mexican rates of Customs
Duty, viz: -
Copra - 12 cents per kilo.
Bags containing the Copra, separate assessment of
60 cents.
hpl (Peso) per Kilo. The rate of 60 cents. $1 (Peso)
varies according to the material of which
the bag is made.
PROBABILITY OF REQUESTS TO CANADIAN GOVERNMENT ON MORE
FAVOURABLE TARIFF TREATMENT OF PRODUCTS IN NETHERLANDS
INDIES. NEW HEBRIDES AND NEW CALEDONIA
28, It is believed that the Canadian Government
will he confronted with requests emanating from the
Netherlands Indies and from New Hebrides and New
Caledonia seeking tariff concessions on Copra (and/or
Cocoanut Oil) on grounds associated with the protection
of the economy of these Territories, A proposal by the
Canadian authorities for the making of a change in the
incidence of the British preferential tariff is not out
of the question and this is a matter to which attention
should be given as regards the interests in Canada of
the Australian Territories and British Southern Pacific
Islands. In this connection attention is drawn to Para-
graph 22. From a study of Paragraphs 22 and 23, it will
be observed, however, that only part of the margins of
preference at present enjoyed in Canada are fixed margins
guaranteed by a Trade Agreement.
ACTION TAKEN TO EXPLORE THE MARKET PROSPECTS
29. Since the receipt of the instructions from
the Australian Prime Minister (Paragraph 1) and apart
from the collation of facts, certain exploratory steps
have been taxon which are herein outlined.
30. Informal discussions have taken place with
the Commercial Treaties Division of the State Department
and other Federal Agencies with respect to an alleviation
of the differential Internal Revenue Tax which, as explain-
ed in Paragraph 21, creates a preferential position in the
United states for the Philippine Islands. The view taken
is that it is not possible to change this situation by
Administrative action. A legislative amendment passed
by both Houses of Congress would be required. Having
regard to -


(a) The slow processes of legislative
change in the United States
(Public Hearings, Committee
stages, etc.)
(b) The fact of this being an Election
year, and
(c) The influence of the Farm block
j s cons ihered likely that a change in the
differential incidence of this tax can be effected
at present.
1 ? , Consultations have taken place with the
united states Defence Commission with respect to
the requirement by the United States of emergency
stocKs of Copra and of Cocoanut Oil. Unless a serious
emergency, completely and directly threatening the
United otates ensued, it will be difficult to induce
the American authorities to acquire such stocks. There
are abundant stocks, of Oil in the United States at
present. Some, such as Soy Bean Oil are locally
produced. a further point is that the Defence
Advisory Commission is concerned with emergency
stocks ol materials required by the Defence services.
I .fu C ?P mission 30 far does not authorize it to deal
with the question of strategic materials for industry
generally. It is the present policy of the admini-
stration to encourage private industry to take care of
its own emergency stocks of raw materials, but this
policy would prooably change in the event of the United
otates becoming involved in the War.
*32* Informal discussions have been held with the
+^ rid n 311 j. nance Department (Tariff Division) and with
the Canadian War Time Trade and Prices Board. The
practicability of broadening the margin of Tariff
preferences in Canada has been considered. As
indicated in Paragraph 23, a considerable margin of
Tariff and other preferences at present exists. This
could not be increased by legislation as the Canadian
Parliament is not now in session. The rate of
Canadian Customs Duty on fats and vegetable oils has
be.-en ci controversial question in Canada during recent
years. It is doubted whether it would be politically
practicable ior the Canadian authorities to increase
the margin of Tarifl preferences. In any event the
present margin of preference (if maintained) is a
substantial one.
-33-. The feasibility of processing in bond in the
United States of Copra originating in the Southern
Pacific has been examined and assurances have been
obtained from the United States Governmental author-
ities that any such action on our part would be facili-
tated. Under the Canadian law as it at present stands
Cocoanut Oil and meal expressed under bond in the
United States from Copra produced in British Terri-
tories, would not be admissible into Canada at the
British preferential rates. The question arises as to
whether it is desirable to ask the Canadian authorities
to concede the British Preferential rate on oil and
meal expressed in the United States from British grown


Copra, Any such request would be predicated upon
the crushing of the British Copra in U.S.A., being
a wartime measure and the Canadian tariff concession
would be sought as a contribution by Canada towards
c.n easing of the economic emergency in the Southern
I acific territories. Informal preliminary talks have
taken place on this angle of the situation and the
subject is under study by the Canadian Departments
concerned, no formal representations, however, having
yet been made. Formal submission and consideration of
such a request would be more feasible if the method of
l ri in the United States were to be
as e . s �l e Means of seeking access to
Canada for British grown u opra (or Oil). Examination
of this alternative is now, however, prejudiced by
the proposal for the construction of new oil expression
plants in Canada. It may become the policy of the
Canadian authorities to accord tariff protection to
such plants.
The Mexican situation has been examined in
consultation with the British Consulate General at
Mexico City and Commercial houses recommended by it,
as well as with the Mexican Consul General in New
York.
? Prior to the news of the proposed erection of
new crushing plants in Canada discussions were arranged
with the Canadian soap manufacturers and with the re-
presentatives of Canadian meat packers. These large
Canadian users were sympathetic and it was expected that
it would be practicable to secure their support, by the
purchase of a substantial proportion of their require-
ments of Cocoanut Oil from the Southern Pacific Terri-
tories. This support would, however, be contingent upon
the goods offered for sale being of satisfactory quality
and available at competitive prices. Since these "dis-
cussions took place, the arrangements which are being
made by private interests for crushing of copra in
Canada will change the outlook in this respect, unless
it be possible to tie-in Empire copra for use in the
new Canadian plants as hereinafter suggested.
RECOMMENDATIONS;
36. The following recommendations are submitted,
namely:
1. It is proposed that the situation in the
United States will be kept under review as against the
possibility of an outlet for British Copra developing
in the United States, Vlhiie as before shown there
does not at present appear to be any prospect of
opening up a market in the United States/the situation
might change in an emergency.
2. In view of probable formal representations
to the Canadian Government by the Netherlands Indies
or French Pacific Territories authorities, consideration
should be given to the question of making formal repre-
sentations to the Canadian Government in the matter* of
the maintenance of the existing preferential position
of Copra from British territories, both through the pre-
ferential customs tariff and the differential war revenue
tax, Ashown at Paragraph 5 the production of the French
Pacific Territories totals 14,000 tons per annum. The
Netherlands Indies production normally totals over 500,000
tons per annum, the destination of these exports in peace-
time being all the major European countries with Holland
and Germany predominating.
