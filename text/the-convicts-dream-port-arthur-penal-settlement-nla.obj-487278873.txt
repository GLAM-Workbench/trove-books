Port Arthur Penal Settlement, 1852
“THE CONVICT’S DREAM”
Composed and written by Charles Ashton, while serving a sentence of twenty
years, a part of which was passed in the Model Prison for trying to regain my
liberty by absconding, and knocking down a constable. I received a sentence of
fifty lashes, thirty days solitary confinement in a dark cell on one pound of bread
per day, and water, with one blanket at night; also twelve months in the light
cells, and two years in heavy chains thirty-five pounds weight. The whole of
this sentence was passed on me by three magistrates. Eather rough on a prisoner ?
I dreamt I saw some prisoners bound,
Standing in heavy chains on the parade ground.
It is true as 1 do tell this tale,
They marched both in and out of the gaol;
On every morning when the first bell rings
Up from our beds we are forced to spring—
To wash ourselves and brush our hair.
Sweep out our cells we must not dare ;
N or we must not dare a word to speak
Or the silent system rules we break.
Then to the lamp-post we are dragged.
When our mouth is gagged, and our wrist is darbed.
While labouring under a scorching sun
The sweat from off our brow does run ;
And whatever labour we are at
We must not look this way nor that,
For the overseer says that will do.
And to the court we are forced to go.
Then the Commandant does at me stare,
“ You are charged with idleness, I do declare.
It is true the overseer [ must believe,
And fifty lashes you must receive.”
Now I lay my coat, vest and shirt on the ground.
And to the triangles I am bound.
When the flagelator did behind me stand
With the cat-o’-nine-tails in his hand.
He flogged me till my back was raw
And painted with my crimson gore ;
When I awoke with a frightful scream—
It was in reality, and not a dream.
