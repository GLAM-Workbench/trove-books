FIRST SETTLEMENT OF THE WIMMERA
It sounds so formal to say how gra-
tified 1 am to have the honor on be-
half of three associations?the His-
torical, the Anthropological Society,
and Field Naturalists? Club ?to be al-
lowed to partake in these nobly con-
ceived ceremonies in honor of the
pioneers of the Wimmera District,
and it is not only on their behalf that
I have to feel proud. There is a per-
sonal element in it. I was not born in
the Wimmera. but as near as I could
get. Next door, in fact, on the Avoca,
and I was brought up on the Wim-
mera. From our hill, where I saw
the sun rise across Mt. Mistake, Mt.
Cole and the Pyrenees and set be-
hind Mt. William and the Grampians,
sprang Coneongella Creek or Doc-
tor?s Greek on one side and the Six
Mile on the other. Across those hills,
along the northern slope was the track
of the early-day settlers, whose route
to the Wimmera was by Bacchus
Marsh, Buninyong, Burnback and Mt.
Mitchell (Lexton) across the Gap on
to the head of the Wimmera, then
along the river to Horsham. But that
is getting ahead too fast. You have
heard a good deal about the Major,
who came here the leader of the first
party of white men, with some blacks
added ?half a dozen actually?but
there were other explorers in the
seven years that elapsed after the
Major reported his Wimmera Plains
and the arrival of the squatters? flocks
and herds. Major Mitchell was one
of the most notable public men. Born
in 1792 at Craigend, Sterlingshire, he
was connected through his mother (a
Miln) with the Carson ironworks. He
was a great engineer and really in-
vented the screw propeller. As a
field naturalist, both in botany and
zoology, he had few equals. Inspired
by the idea of settling the great
problem of inland Australia and its
river systems, he set out in 1836 to
finally solve the Darling problem.
Having done this, he set out from
Cohuna to reach the sea at the Gle<i-
elg mouth, discovering the Loddon,
Avoca and Wimmera Plains and, in-
cidentally, Mt. Arapiles. This day,
a century ago, he spied over the land
and pronounced it good. The tide of
overlanders from the Sydney side to
Melbourne had turned towards Ade-
laide. The first party was that of
Joseph Hawdon, who also had been
in the first party to Melbourne in 1836.
Edward John Eyre, who had been
grazing for a couple of years and who
was to become Australia?s foremost ex-
plorer, assembled his cattle near Lake
George and by the 9th February, 1838,
was fairly on his way. Crossing Mt.
Alexander on the Major?s homeward
track and then diverging to find the
Yarrayne, which Mitchell described as
flowing to the westward with a depth of
nine feet, he found the Yarrayne or
Loddon, but it was nothing more than
a creek, flowing only in wet seasons,
and when Eyre reached it, now May,
perfectly dry, it was taking a nearly
due northerly course instead of a wes-
terly one. Eyre then decided upon
tracing down the Wimmera, feeling
convinced that it was the Lindsay of
Captain Sturt. He traced it in a north-
westerly direction to where it emptied
itself into a large fresh-water lake of
40 miles circumference, which he nam-
ed Hindmarsh after the Governor of
South Australia, as he was then very

near the boundary of that colony. From
Hindmarsh he could discover no water
to the northward or westward, although
he searched for three weeks, traversing
the Mallee scrub with two men and
six horses. They had to abondon their
horses and return on foot. Then, on
reduced rations of flour, steps were
retraced to the Loddon. Thus May,
1838, saw white men, seven in all,
crossing the Wimmera District. Eyre,
by the way, reached Adelaide in the
middle of July. Charles Bonney, who
had accompanied Joseph Hawdon on
his first Adelaide trip, was the next
on the Wimmera. Taking cattle for
Hawdon, he followed Eyre?s track into
..e Wimmera-and ther went down the
Glenelg, to the coast line past Henty?s
Muntham Station. This was in 1839 ?
the early part. Then came a most mar-
vellous journey. Joseph Hawdon, pos-
sibly the greatest of Australian bush-
men and of great intrepidity, set off
with A. M. Mundy?by the bye, both
Bonney and Mundy became high Go-
vernment officials in South Australia
later on?in a tandem gig from Ebden?s
Carlsruhe station, leaving on the 11th
July, 1839. They drove along the
northern route (that of Eyre and
Bonney) through the Wimmera and
on to Adelaide, doing the 540 miles
in 27 days?a remarkable achieve-
ment. Just on their heels came George
Hamilton, also later a high South
Australian official, with a party of
nine men and his herds. Two of his
men were immigrants or, as they were
terms, Jimmy Grants. Hamilton, in
his account, writes : I then ascended
a high peak of Mt. Arapiles and had
a fine view. The Wimmera could be
seen to the north ; it ran into two
small lakes. There were several other
overlanding parties this year who took
what had become known as the coast
route, which it actually was in South
Australia. A drought?something not
unknown since?culminated in 1839-10.
Lake Burrumbeet dried up and remain-
ed so until 1841. This somewhat de-
layed settlement, but the Sydney over-
landers were still arriving, somewhat
accelerated by the drought, to fill up
the head waters of the Avoca, Hopkins,
Wannon. Lieutenant Briggs (of Briggs?
Bluff), who was acting for the Redfern
Estate, brought sheep and ran them on
the Muekbilly Creek in 1840 or 1841.
C. B. Hall (of Hall?s Gap) left Monaro
in 1840 and arrived in 1841. occupying
La Rose and Mokepilly, where p. D.
Rose and Jackson were running stock,
but before him were Irvine at Glen-
logie, just below Mt. Cole, then Dr.
Finlay, of Twofold Bay, the superinten-
dent being Lynott or Decameron and
W. J. T. Clarke, his superintendent
Francis being killed by one of his own
men in 1842. Ben Boyd, the �biquitous,
came, or rather sent his men, to Led-
court in June, 1842, closely followed by
James Monckton Darlot and Archibald
McLachlan at Brighton. Dugald Mc-
Pherson and William Taylor came to
Longerenong in 1844 and 1845 saw the
Firebraees, father and son, at Vectis,
and Pynsent and Splatt at Wonwondat.
The Scotts, from Buninyong, went down
the Yarriambiack and took up War-
raeknabeal, the sons (Robert and An-
drew) residing, the Wilsons at Wal-
mer, Kewell and Muekbilly; William
Patterson, Upper Regions. Dimboola ;
J. A. Airey, Mt. Talbot; James Hors-
fall, Rich Avon; Robert William von
Stieglitz, Lake Hindmarsh ; Ayrey,
another; Darnell and Nicoll, Warra-
nooke ; Rutherford and Russell, Carr?s
Plains; Urquhart and Glendinning,
Maryvale and St. Mary?s Lake. Across
the border came Heighway Jones to the
Tatiara country, though without Vic-
torian authority; McLeod, Beneyo, w?th
authority; Baird and Hodgkinson soon
after, and by 1840 the Wimmera was
practically all occupied. It was grow-
ing up and had to be christened. Vic-
toria, which started as Port Phillip on
the 21st day of May, 1839, was the land
south of the Strathbogie Ranges. On
the Ist of July, 1840, it went up to the
Murray, and on the 13th September,
1843, it became as we know it now, but
divided in four districts and three
counties ?Bourke, Grant and Nor-
mandy. The Wimmera formed part of
the Portland Bay district, which was
everything west of the Werribee ami
the Avoca. The filling up just described
made this district too unwieldy and in
November, 1846, the Wimmera Dis-
trict was proclaimed (everything north
of the Divide lying between the Avoca
and the South Australian boundary).
The Wimmera slumbered on until the
gold discoveries in 1851 called its com-
missioner, W. H. Wright, away to be
chief commissioner of them and" the re-
call of J. M. Clow, on -e of Ballerook
and Pine Plains, in his place. Toiner
and Andrew supplied the next romantic
episode. Adelaide (that is South Aus-
tralia ) was emptied of its manhood and
incidentally of nearly all its coin when
the great rush to Mt. Alexander took
place at the end of 1851. Toiner, Com-
missioner of Police, conceived the idea
of following them and escorting their
winnings back to Adelaide. He found
a track through Border Town and, cut-
ting across the Little Desert from Ka
nlva to Polkemmet, came on his fellow
colonists in Adelaide Gully. This was
in February and in March he was back
with 6000 ounces of gold. In May he
took to Adelaide 20,000 ounces, and ia
July 28,000 ounces to be given to 1021
families, a fair monthly return for
each, though gold was only worth �2
15/ to �3 an ounce. Adelaide, from
being down in the dumps, revelled in
riches. But the gold returns fell off.
In 1853, 66,000 diggers certainly won
3,090,000 ounces, but that was less than
�3 a week each. There were no duties
then, but cost of living was as much is
the gold won. Flour was �4OO a ton on
the fields, and so on. The eyes of many
were turned to the soil and not the
wash dirt. Eventually the 1869 Land
Act made the northern lands available.
Such a trek there was. Waggons and
drays came into the Wimmera with the
farmer in an almost constant proces-
sion. The open plans were favored, as
grubbing cost from �1 to �4 an acre.
The single-furrow plough was the only
implement, with tyne harrows. Al-
though the early seventies up to 1876
were wet years, the average wheat yield
was a bag and a half to the acre?the
bags were then four bushel. The area
then was 320 acres (not 640, that came
later) at 2/ an acre a year to the
Government. It was as well, the far-
mer or free selector?the term cocky
was unknown?had consequently only
half as much to owe the Government.
The great drought of 1877-84 drove off
the weak, but taught much farming and
brought in the various water supply
systems. Then followed the use of
superphosphate and fallow ?the old
methods revived?and the Wimmera
came into its own. Ups and downs
there were to be, certainly; but each
down was not so far down as the last
and each up a little higher. The Wim-
mera farmer and his home afford the
best argument for decentralisation.
