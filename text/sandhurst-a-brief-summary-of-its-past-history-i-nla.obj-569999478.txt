j^REFACE,
a preface should partake very much of the
character of “ a talk with the stranger in the gate,”
fthis book’s appearance may be briefly explained.
On the election of Councillor J. Cohn as mayor
of this city, on 13th August, 1888, he considered
that, owing to the number of visitors to the colony on account
of the holding of the Centennial Exhibition in Melbourne,
the opportunity of bringing the resources of the district
prominently forward should not be lost. As one of the most
effective means of doing this, he gave instructions for the
compilation and printing of this little volume, for the purpose
of presenting to visitors an idea of what our past has been,
and what the prospects of the district are.




flic Citu df
cAd
»HE site now occupied by the thriving and prosperous
City of Sandhurst was 37 years ago part of an
w almost unexplored bush ; the only persons who
had previously invaded its precincts—save of course
» the aboriginal inhabitants —having been a few shep-
herds and sheep station hands. The magic change was
brought about by the discovery of the golden treasures of
the district by some of the station hands referred to. Of
this important stage in our history particulars are given
later on. In the beginning of the rush, Bendigo (as it was
then called) was solely a “ canvas town” ; that is, the whole
of the thousands of inhabitants then resided in canvas tents.
Gradually, as the permanence of the field was more clearly
demonstrated, a town was gradually built up, and the first
humble structures have since been transformed into much
more substantial and ornamental buildings.
Sandhurst is built upon the Bendigo creek, the banks of
which are lined with numerous gentle hills, affording a
splendid system of natural drainage. It was proclaimed a
municipality on the 24th April, 1855 ; a borough on the
nth September, 1863 ; and a city on the 18th July, 1871.
It is the largest city in Australia, as far as area is concerned,


the jurisdiction of the City Council extending over
acres, with a population of 26,000. The annual value of
rateable property is and the annual revenue from
all sources is There are 120 miles of made streets
in the city. These figures of course only refer to the city
proper, which is the centre of a district of fully 100,000
inhabitants. It is on the main line of railway connecting
Melbourne with the Murray, the northern boundary of our
colony, and extending thence into New South Wales. This
line was opened as far as Sandhurst (100 miles from
Melbourne) on 20th October, 1862, by the then Governor,
Sir Henry Barkly, with most elaborate ceremonies. The
contract for this line was signed in June, 1858, or less than
seven years after the discovery of this gold field, and the
work cost about or about a mile. No
better evidence of the very rapid growth of the city could
be given than the fact that such a large expenditure was
authorised for railway communication to a place which a
few years previously had been an uninhabited bush. Since
then, Sandhurst, as becomes its importance as the leading
town of the northern and north-western portion of the
colony, has been made the centre of a system of railways
extending in all directions, and to still be further increased
in the immediate future. All these railways have had the
effect of adding to and strengthening its importance as the
commercial and manufacturing centre of a very large district.
While the City Council has always had a steady call upon
its revenue for the purpose of forming streets, roads, and
bridges, the City Fathers have not lost sight of the necessity
for beautifying the city, and special activity has been shown
in this direction during the last few years. One of the


first features which strikes the visitor is the tree planting.
After the operations of the diggers, who, in a few short
years, in the fevered search for gold, turned over and washed
away a large amount of surface soil, the place presented a
generally barren appearance. But, by the wise foresight of
our municipal governors, this undesirable state of affairs
has long since been remedied, and a very large sum of
money, spread over many years, has been expended in tree
planting. All the streets of any importance are furnished
on both sides with noble lines of trees, both English and
Australian—our streets being sufficiently wide to afford
plenty of space for the trees. The effect, especially on warm
summer days, of these splendid lines of foliage is something
beautiful, and the citizens are pardonably proud of it, as in
this respect Sandhurst cannot be held to hold second position
to any city of its size in the world. There are at present no
less than 85 miles of street trees in Sandhurst, and they are
gradually being extended. This tree planting has earned
for Sandhurst the name of “ The Forest City.”
Another ornamentation of which Bendigonians are in no
small degree proud is Rosalind Park. Sandhurst is in a
most unique position in having such a beautiful recreation
ground so close to the heart of the city. It is indeed the centre
of the city, as it forms one side of each of the two principal
streets. It occupies 66 acres, and is ornamentally cultivated
and well laid out with broad walks. On the slopes of the
hill which rises in its centre there is a handsome fountain the
water from which passes down a series of cascades, terminating
in a large fish-pond with another fountain in its centre. But
the real beauty spot is the fernery, which has been constructed
in the lower part of the park. All the finest and most


attractive ferns in the colony have been procured for this
place ; rockeries, grottoes, caves, and fish-ponds formed ;
and the whole so invested with the appearances of nature
that many visitors almost openly express disbelief that it
wholly owes its origin to the hands of man.
The recreation of the citizens has been further attended to
by the construction of an artificial lake nearly half a mile
long, known as Lake Weeroona, w'ith a well laid out park
surrounding it. There are two rowing clubs with boat-
houses on this lake (which is only a mile from the centre
of the city) and regattas are of frequent occurrence.
Beside these places, there are also in the city a large and
convenient agricultural show ground, and about a mile
out a large cricket ground, while three and a half miles
from the city are well kept Botanical Gardens, covering an
area of 36 acres. In the centre of the city, where Pall Mall
and View Point meet, there is a large triangular area called
Charing Cross, on which is erected an exceedingly handsome
fountain, which cost about /1500, the money being provided
partly from public sources and partly by the generosity of
Mr. George Lansell, the wealthy quartz reefer. It is termed
the Alexandra Fountain, and is principally composed of
highly polished granite. It stands 30 feet above the road-
way and rises out of a basin 50 feet in diameter and well
stocked with gold fish. This handsome structure was
opened on the sth July, 1881, by His Royal Highness
Prince Albert Victor, assisted by Prince George, and in the
presence of 25,000 people.
The leading streets of Sandhurst are ornamented by hand-
some and commodious business and other establishments,
and in Pall Mall and View Point there are about a dozen


handsome and imposing buildings occupied by the different
banking corporations, whose business, in a centre like this,
where so much new wealth is daily produced, must necessarily
be large.
In Sandhurst there are about 1000 gold mining leases in
occupation, covering about 18,750 acres.
Up to the present the remarks have been mainly devoted
to the city proper. Three and a half miles from the centre
of Sandhurst is the prosperous borough of Eaglehawk,
practically a suburb of our city. It has a population of 7500,
and, like Sandhurst, it has planted street trees extensively
and, in emulation of the city, it also has its artificial lake and
fernery. Surrounding Sandhurst are the large shires of
Marong, Huntly, Strathfieldsaye, Echuca, East Loddon,
Gordon, Swan Hill, Waranga, Mclvor. &c., &c., and the
boroughs of Raywood and Inglewood. In these, with the
exception of Eaglehawk, Inglewood, and Raywood, the
population, though partly interested in mining, is chiefly
engaged in pursuits of an agricultural or pastoral natuie.
Sandhurst, by the way, is the centre of a very large cattle
trade, the local market being largely availed of by the large
stock raisers of New South Wales and Queensland ; con-
sequently the business done is second only to that of
Melbourne. About 500,00 c. head of stock pass through
this market annually.
Sandhurst is well supplied with gas for lighting purposes.
The city will be the first in Australia to adopt electric
tramways, an agreement for the construction of lines from
Sandhurst to Eaglehawk, White Hills, and Kangaroo Flat,
having been signed, and the surveys made.
The necessity for bathing in the summer months has


induced the council to erect commodious swimming baths
in various parts of the city, and these are much appreciated.
Sandhurst has been erected into a Roman Catholic diocese,
and is presided over by a bishop and coadjutor-bishop. It
will probably be shortly made the headquarters of an
Anglican bishopric.
The climate of Sandhurst, though sometimes warm in
summer, is most salubrious and genial, the winter, spring,
and autumn, being delightful. It is a great place of resort
for people suffering from any chest or lung complaint, the
clear dry atmosphere being most beneficial.
OUR WATER SUPPLY.
“ Sandhurst would be nothing without its water ” is an
expression frequently heard, and in which there is much
truth, for our natural supply is so small as to be scarcely
appreciable. This made necessary the carrying out of a
most extensive scheme. A magnificent reservoir was con-
structed at Malmsbury by the building of an immense dam
across the bed of the Coliban river, joining two hills, and
giving a capacity for the storage of 2,841,000,000 gallons
(capable by a moderate expenditure of being trebled) and a
drainage area of 64,000 acres. This water is conducted to
Sandhurst by an aqueduct 52 miles in length, with three
tunnels—one half a mile long —cut in solid granite and blue
stone, with several miles of fluming and Syphons. The
principal reservoir for the city supply is at Crusoe, with a
capacity of 320,000,000 gallons. There are four other
reservoirs of from 69,000,000 to 27,000,000 gallons, besides


other smaller reservoirs. The streets are laid with mains
115 miles in length. Besides the city supply, branch
channels supply the surrounding districts for miles in radius.
The city consumption in summer is over two millions
gallons daily. These works, which have been productive of
a vast amount of good, have cost a great deal of money, the
construction involving an expenditure of over
OUR PUBLIC BUILDINGS AND INSTITUTIONS.
The Public Offices. —Sandhurst can lay claim to many
handsome edifices, but pride of place in this direction must
be given to the handsome public offices recently erected by
the Government in Pall Mall. This noble pile accommodates
the postal, telegraphic, lands, police, water supply, and
treasury departments. It has a frontage of 155 feet and
a depth of 100 feet, and the tower rises 142 feet from the
pavement. The building is one of the handsomest of its
kind in the colony. The tower is furnished with a clock,
with a set of Winchester chimes, of local manufacture. This
building cost and it is intended to, at once, spend
/30,000 more in building law courts alongside.
The Town Hall. —The large and commodious building
erected for the purposes of the municipal government stands
upon a large square which divides the two portions of Bull
street, and it presents a very effective picture from the Mall.
Portion of the building has been erected for many years, but
it is a comparatively short time since it was fully completed.
The general design is in the style of the Italian Renaissance,


with towers at each of three corners ; and the elaborate
ornamentation of the exterior in stucco, with fluted pillars
and polished granite columns, renders the building a very
handsome one. The building contains council and committee
rooms, offices for the mayor, and clerical and engineering
staffs, and a large court room. Besides these there is a very
large ball room with music gallery, decorated beautifully
and most tastefully. The building cost
The Mechanics’ Institute. —Another of our most
handsome public buildings is that of theSnadhurst Mechanics
Institute, a large building also of the Italian Renaissance style
and with ample accommodation for the free reading room,
members’ reading room, a splendid library, and chess,
smoking, and other rooms. The benefits of this institution,
containing, as it does, no less than 14,000 volumes of works
upon all kinds of literary and scientific subjects, and news-
papers and periodicals from all countries and colonies, are
widespread. The institution had its inception in the very
early days of the goldfield. In 1853 a large number of
exhibits were collected for the Paris Exhibition of 18341 and
these were shown here for some time prior to being sent
away, in a building specially erected. This was afterwards
used as a Mechanics’ Institute, and from this small beginning
the present splendid institution has developed. The library
is free to all, but books can only be taken away by subscribers
oi£i per annum.
School of Mines and Industries.—This excellent
and popular educational institution was founded on 2ist
April, 1873, for the purpose of imparting instruction in the
various branches of science connected with mining;
instruction in the theory and practice of mining, mine


surveying, engineering, geology, mineralogy, metallurgy,
chemistry, assaying, mathematics, drawing, engraving,
telegraphy, telephony, and numerous other kindred subjects.
There are ten lecturers and teachers, and 550 regular pupils.
Connected with the school is an excellent and well-stocked
museum of mineral and other curiosities, also workshops,
laboratories, &c.
Fine Art Gallery. —This institution has been very
recently established, but it has already met with a success
far beyond the expectation of the promoters. It has secured
a large collection of excellent works of art both by British
and Colonial artists, and its stock of pictures is rapidly
extending. At present the gallery is located in the School
of Mines lecture room, but they will shortly be in possession
of a large gallery of their own. The Government has shown
its appreciation of the value of the committee’s work by
placing a special grant of on the estimates.
The Hospital. —This noble institution for the relief of
the sick and wounded was founded in 1853, on a com-
paratively modest scale, but now it is a very large and
handsome institution, with large grounds and garden—ten
acres altogether. The building is in the modern style of
architecture, with a tower, containing a four-dial clock, in
the centre. The main building, and the “ Bowen ” wing
adjoining, contain altogether twenty-one spacious wards ; and
there are also detached wards for the treatment of erysipelas
and lunatic patients. The benefits of the Hospital are
availed of by residents for scores of miles around, and, con-
sequently, there are ever increasing demands on its re-
sources, and further additions are in contemplation. There
are two resident surgeons and several honorary physicians.


In connection with the Hospital, there is a training school
for nurses.
Bendigo Benevolent Asylum.—ln a prosperous com-
munity like ours, there is no need for a workhouse on the
pattern of those in the old country, for the relief of persons
unable to obtain work ; but, nevertheless, the fact remains
that “the poor we have always with us.” Our poor com-
prise mainly the aged and infirm, who have neglected or have
been unable to provide for the evenings of their lives. The
Benevolent Asylum is adjacent to the Hospital, and the
style of architecture is the lonic. The buildings, which
stand in a reserve of eleven acres, cost There are
beds for nearly two hundred inmates ; and, besides those in
the institution, out-door relief is administered to many old
people.
MASONIC Hall. —The ancient craft of Masons is very
strongly represented in Sandhurst, and, in keeping with
their numbers and importance, they have one of the
handsomest buildings of its kind in the southern hemi-
sphere. The building which is of the Corinthian order—
appropriately, as one of the lodges is named the Golden
and Corinthian —has a frontage of 100 feet, with six pillars
38 feet high supporting the entablature and pediment, the
whole producing a noble effect. The interior accom-
modation is ample and convenient, and the decorations are
exceedingly handsome. The building cost
Amusements. —Sandhurst can boast of an exceptionally
handsome and well-arranged theatre, with comfortable
seating for 2000 people, with all requisite accessories,
the cost being £12,000. It is called the Princess Theatre.
There is also St. James’ Hall, which cost and


which accommodates 1900 people, and several smaller Halls,
Friendly Societies and Associations. —All the
leading Friendly Societies of the world are repre-
sented here, and have large memberships. These, again,
are united in a committee, which has a large freehold
building, keeps its own doctors, and dispenses its own medi-
cines. The cost of administration, being spread over
thousands, is thus minimised. The most important of the
trades organisations is the Bendigo Miners’ Association,
which number about 2400 members. This Association,
which possesses much influence, is especially designed to
watch the miners’ interests, carefully scrutinise all mining
legislation, and to assist members in cases of accident. The
relatives of any member killed in a mine receive from
to £\lo.
The Churches.—The various denominations of the
Christian religion are well provided for in the matter of
church accommodation, the Anglican, Roman Catholic,
Presbyterian, Wesleyan, Baptist, and other branches having
commodious edifices. St. Paul’s (Anglican) is provided with
a bell tower and a set of musical chimes. The Hebrew
congregation has also a synagogue of striking appearance,
the building being in the Byzantine style.
EDUCATION.vI.—The State Schools in the district are
numerous and commodious, and several of them are very-
handsome specimens of architecture. All these schools are
free, the whole cost being borne by the State. There are
also several h'gher educational establishments, including
the Corporate ! ligh School, a Grammar School, Girton Col-
lege for ladies, and a Roman Catholic Convent High School.


Fire Brigades. —The city is well provided for in the
case of fire, there being six fire brigades, all on the volunteer
system.
Mining Investment. —The large business doing in
mining shares daily is transacted by the Bendigo Stock
Exchange, with 50 members, who meet three times a day.
The entrance fee to this body is
OUR INDUSTRIES AND OUR RESOURCES.
The main industry of the Sandhurst district is of course
that of gold mining and to this a special portion of this small
volume is devoted, and below is given a brief outline of our
other industries and resources.
Agriculture and Irrigation. —Surrounding Sand-
hurst there is a vast agricultural area, devoted chiefly to the
cultivation of wheat, oats, and barley. Wheat growing is
mainly pursued, and by far the greater proportion of the
wheat raised in the colony has been grown in the area lying
north, north-east, and north-westward of Sandhurst. The
more northern areas have in the past shown much fluctuation
in the results, due to the seasons of drought, caused by
irregular and insufficient rainfall. But now all this
fluctuation and uncertainty is being removed by the great
irrigation schemes which have been inaugurated and are being
rapidly carried out, partly by the State and partly by local
effort under State supervision. The expenditure has been
vast, but the results attending will far over-reach the outlay.
The farmer on the arid northern plains is rendered almost
entirely independent of climatic influences, which, if adverse,


would in former years mean ruin. It is now possible to flood
the land just at the time when the growing crop requires the
moisture, and what were once dry plains are now being con-
verted into areas smiling with verdure. This great work will
materially add to the prosperity of Sandhurst, which is the
great commercial centre of all these areas. Not that irrigation
is perfect yet. It is but a few years since it was adopted as
a general and State policy, and these matters take time, but
still the good results are already plainly apparent.
“ Intense culture ” will follow irrigation, and then the
resources of the district will be much more fully availed of.
Dairying is also an important industry in portions of the
district, and large quantities of butter and cheese are
exported.
ViNE-GROWING. —This is a highly important industry in
this district, and Bendigo wines have long since made a
name for themselves all over the world, and have taken
leading prizes at all the great exhibitions of the world. The
soil and climate of the district are eminently suited for the
cultivation of the grape, and, though the industry is a
large one at present, there is ample room for a very large
extension. The present production might be very largely
increased without getting ahead of the demand. Indeed, of
late years, many orders from London could be only par-
tially carried out. The colonial demand is, owing to
climatic conditions, large, and many growers do not look
beyond Australia for a market ; but our wines being pure,
and of excellent quality, there would be a never-failing
market for an unlimited supply. The classes chiefly grown
here are Muscat, Reisling, Verdeilho, Chablis, Hock,
Hermitage, Carbinet, Chasselas, and Burgundy.


Fruit-Growing. —Sandhurst is a great fruit-grow'ing
district, and during the season the quantity exported is im-
mense. Almost any sort of fruit will grow here in profusion,
and oranges, lemons, citrons, grapes, cherries, plums, pears,
quinces, almonds, gooseberries, currants, figs, and numerous
other fruits are cultivated largely. The olive will thrive
well here, but has not yet been largely planted for com-
mercial purposes ; almonds also grow luxuriantly, and from
each of these oil has been manufactured on a small scale
with success. For the making of raisins and currants, there
is a large field here, but the industry has not yet developed
beyond the incipient stage.
Manufactures. —The large demand for all classes of
mining machinery at Sandhurst led to the establishment of
several very large foundries here, employing a great many
hands. They not only supply the whole of the machinery
used locally, but are continually receiving large orders from
other gold-fields and all the colonies. Orders from the
South African gold-fields have also been executed. There
is also a very large rolling stock works, which has all the
latest improvements in machinery and labor-saving appli-
ances. At this factory, carriages, trucks, and other rolling
stock for the Victorian railways are manufactured. Another
very important industry is the Bendigo Pottery, which has
achieved a reputation all over the colonies, and which turns
out weekly large quantities of crockeryware, earthenware,
piping, and similar goods. There are also a large number
of brick and tile works. There are several extensive
flour mills, and quite a number of breweries. The Victoria
Brewing Company possesses the only lager beer brewery in
the colony, but their success has induced a Melbourne


Company to decide also on erecting a large lager brewery.
A large stone-polishing works supplies granite columns and
other high-class work for all the leading buildings in Mel-
bourne and other places. The local tannery employs a
large number of hands, and its products have obtained
prizes at the London and other exhibitions. In addition,
there are several powder manufactories, where all descrip-
tions of mining and blasting powders are made ; and several
large pyrites works, for the extraction of gold from other
minerals and refractory ores.

OUR GOLD-FIELD.
THE ALLUVIAL ERA
The Gold Discovery.—The year 1851 would certainly
have been memorable enough in the history of the colony of
Victoria, owing to its having been the year in which effect
was given to the separation from New South Wales ; but
the excitement consequent thereon was destined to be com-
pletely eclipsed by the discovery of rich gold-fields, which
gave the progress of the infant colony a greater impetus than
the wildest dreamer could have previously imagined. ' First
came the discovery of the Ballarat field, then Forest Creek
(Castlemaine), and then Bendigo (Sandhurst). The sur-
face in each of these places was very rich, and the
tremendous excitement which they caused resulted in a
complete disruption of business in Melbourne and Geelong,


then the only centres of population, and in the other
colonies. Then the news travelled like wild-fire all over
the globe, and there was such an accession of immigrants
that in three or four years the population of the colony was
raised from 77,000 to 480,000.
In the beginning of November, 1851, the locality now
occupied by the Sandhurst goldfield was an almost unoc-
cupied bush, being well-timbered, chiefly with ironbark and
eucalypti, and with no habitations, save, perhaps, a shep-
herd’s hut. N It then formed part of a squatter’s “run,” or
sheep farm. Later in the month, however, gold was found,
and, in a few months afterwards, the place was swarming
with thousands of sturdy diggers. The exciting events of
the time, when fortunes were to be had almost for the asking,
tended to obscure in some degree the actual circumstances
of the first discovery ; but a recent minute investigation
threw a good deal of light upon the subject. At the period
referred to, a Mr. Frederick Fenton, manager of the Por-
cupine sheep station, had two large flocks of sheep grazing
near where the then undreamt-of city of Sandhurst was to
stand. These sheep not having been brought in by the
shepherds at the time appointed for shearing to commence,
Mr. Fenton rode out to find them. He found the sheep, but
no shepherds. He rode along further until he reached the
junction of two small watercourses, one then known as
Bendigo creek and the other afterwards named Golden
gully. Here, to his astonishment, he found the two shep-
herds busily engaged in turning over the soil and gathering
up large quantities of gold. With some trouble he per-
suaded one of the men to take charge of the sheep, the
other remaining to gather up the precious metal which was


scattered about with so much profusion. The news of the
discovery spread rapidly, and created great excitement at
the Forest creek rush (then in full swing), and a large
crowd soon made for the new Eldorado. The new-comers
were unfortunate at first, and the Bendigo rush—which it
was called, after the creek previously mentioned—was pro-
nounced a “ duffer,” and the greater portion of the
new-comers returned to Forest creek. Many, however,
still remained, and a few week’s work soon showed that the
field would be a lasting one. The disappointed ones in re-
turning to Forest creek met a great many diggers on the
way to Bendigo, and gave such bad accounts of the new
field that but few had the courage to keep on. Among the
earlier visitors was a Sergeant of Police, on patrol, with
some black (aboriginal) troopers under him. Their case is
worth a line or two. The Sergeant knew that he had to be
back to head-quarters in a few days, but on seeing wealth
so easily obtainable he marked out a claim, and during the
first night he and the blacks obtained two pounds weight o
gold. During the next two days this was greatly augmented
and then the claim was sold for a large sum to Mr. R.
McKenzie Clarke and party. That three days work was
the foundation of a fortune for the Sergeant. He would
fain have stopped at the “ rush,” but not even resignation
from the force would have admitted of his doing so, as he
would have to give considerable notice before he could give
up duty. The next conspicuous success was that of a party
of new arrivals (four men) who got fifty ozs. gold for the
first days work. When the rush was properly at work, the
results were in many cases fabulous. The general yield
would, after the larger pieces of gold were picked out, be


about an ounce per tub, containing four buckets of dirt, but
there are many well recorded instances of more sensational
yields. For instance fifty-two pounds weight of solid gold
were obtained in a “ pocket ” or small hollow in one of the
claims. At Eaglehawk two fifty lb. flour bags of dirt gave
forty lbs. weight of gold. Two brothers at Pegleg gully sank
a shallow hole and from the bottom picked up no less than
one hundred lbs. weight of gold. Several large nuggets were
found, including the “ Victoria,” bought by the colonial
legislature, for presentation to the Queen, for £ 1650, and the
“ Dascombe,” sold in London for
Before Christmas, there were a thousand diggers at work,
and the New Chum gully had then been discovered. The
diggers were then getting only £2 15s. per ounce for gold,
though it was worth After Christmas, the population
on the diggings, through the discoveries, which soon followed,
of numerous other gullies, some of them excessively rich, was
greatly increased. The opening up of Spring gully,
Tipperary gully, White Hills, Ironbark, Devonshire, Eagle-
hawk, Pegleg, California, Long, and numerous other gullies
soon set the whole place aflame.
1852 saw the whole place alive, and the Ballarat and
Forest creek diggings were deserted by large proportions of
their inhabitants, and the population of Bendigo was for a
time enhanced at the rate of a thousand or more per week.
When Bendigo was at its full height there must have been
25,000 diggers on the field. At one mass meeting, held to
consider diggers’ grievances, almost in the centre of the city
—where All Saints’ church now stands —there were computed
to be at least 20,000 diggers present, and the scene at this
meeting, where, a couple of years previous, nature in all its


pristine robes had held full sway, would have furnished
material for a philosopher to fill a volume upon the influence
of the gold fever.
One of the notable events of the gold epoch will for
ever form a prominent feature of the history of Australasia
—the “ diggers’ license ” agitation. Shortly after the out-
break of the goldfields, the authorities conceived the idea
that the greatly increased cost of administration resulting
upon the gold discoveries could be made up in part by the
imposition of a license fee, and a mandate was issued to the
effect that all persons on the diggings whether directly or
indirectly engaged in the search for gold, should pay a tax
of thirty shillings per month for a claim twelve feet square.
This was paid by the great majority who were doing well,
but there were numerous attempts to .evade it, and if this
were a purely historical sketch pages could be written on the ex-
citing incidents of the period. The buv was enforced with
great strictness, and, indeed, harshness. “ License hunting ”
soon became obnoxious, diggers being liable to arrest at any
moment if they could not produce a license, and large numbers
of mounted police being engaged in the daily hunt. A very
determined opposition—known since as the Red Ribbon
agitation —sprang up, and the matter became serious. The
Bendigo diggers, led by clear headed men, kept within
bounds ; but at Ballarat affairs drifted into such a state that
the authorities were opposed by an armed force of diggers,
and the celebrated Eureka Stockade fight, in which the
diggers were opposed to portions of the 12th and 40th
regiments, took place. Numbers were killed on both sides.
Though the diggers were for a time worsted, the result was
that the authorities recognised their grievances, and not only


were attempts to increase the license fee abandoned, but the
tax was abolished altogether, other methods of obtaining a
revenue being substituted. Many of the leaders of the
agitation now occupy high and honorable positions in the
colony.
The time was a stirring one, and even a brief epitome like
this would be incomplete without a glance at the crime of
the period. The diggers as a rule were well-behaved and
law abiding, but amongst the thousands who flocked to the
gold-fields were numbers of discharged and escaped convicts
from the penal settlements in Tasmania and New South
Wales. Highway robberies by bushrangers were common,
and the police escorts of coaches carrying gold from the
diggings to Melbourne were frequently and successfully
attacked. A notorious scoundrel named “ Black Douglas ”
was a terror in the early days, and indeed the road was not
safe for any one with gold in his possession. Still it must
be said that the crime records pale into insignificance
compared with those of the Californian rush a few years
earlier. The scum of the world was attracted to California,
while, leaving the convicts sent to Australia by the
Imperial authorities out of the question, Australia may be
truthfully said to have attracted population of a much higher
standard—daring and adventurous it may be said, but withal
possessed of the true and noble instincts of enterprising
pioneers.
The exciting events of the time were responsible for many
strange and extraordinary vagaries on the part of diggers.
Wealth was so suddenly thrust upon many that it came to
be despised. A digger would make a few hundred pounds,
and would then go off to Melbourne on a “ spree,” and then


come back and earn more. It was quite a common thing
to see money wasted in the most unmeaning and aimless
manner. It is matter of well authenticated history that
diggers in drunken bravado lighted their pipes with one and
five pound notes; that sandwiches were made and eaten
with notes where the ham should be, and that dozens of
champagne were set up as skittles to be smashed into pieces
by the reckless diggers.
The alluvial diggings proved so extensive that for eight
or nine years they continued to yield handsomely, and
thousands of acres of ground were turned over in the search.
The most prosperous year of all was 1853, when the diggers
obtained, according to the official returns, 661,749 ozs. gold,
valued at no less than When the richer
portions of the alluvial fields were worked out, attention was
turned to quartz mining, and since then Bendigo has
achieved the position of the foremost quartz mining district,
not only in Australia, but in the world ; of this, more anon,
THE QUARTZ ERA .
When the alluvial rushes fell off somewhat, many of the
diggers turned their attention to quartz. In the height of
the alluvial diggings, when the sinking of a hole a few feet
was all that was necessary, perhaps, to expose a hoard of the
precious metal, the quartz resources were neglected—known
but not realized. One of the most readable and entertaining
of late writers on the early days of the gold-field—Mr. R.
M’Kenzie Clarke, who recently published his reminiscences


in the Bendigo Advertiser —relates how the very earliest of
the diggers used to amuse themselves on Sundays by taking
a hammer and knocking specimens off the great boulders of
quartz which rose above the surface on several of the many
eminences in the district —beacons, as it were, to guide the
miner to the wealth which lay hidden below. This was in
most cases merely an amusement, and many of the diggers
sought the lumps of white quartz, studded as they were with
shining specks of gold, merely as curious specimens to send
to far away friends.
But the day came when this quartz began to be worked,
and though the appliances were of the rudest and most
primitive character, the results were sufficiently sensational
to establish quartz mining as a profitable industry long
before the brilliancy of the alluvial fields had become dim.
The surface formations were soon actively operated upon,
and with results of a truly sensational character. Crushings
of from fifty to a hundred ounces per ton were comparatively
common; while there were many places which ranged
higher, some going as high as 500 ozs. per ton, and in a
few notable instances 1500 ozs. and 2000 ozs. per ton.
Even in those halcyon days there was a strong pessimist
feeling abroad. Few amongst those working the quartz
expected it to last much longer than the alluvial, and, as the
surface reefs or lodes were worked out, thought the golden
resources of the district were exhausted. They were backed
up by scientific opinion, and the memorable remarks of Sir
Roderick Murchison, the then famous geologist, to the
effect that when the surface formations were exhausted there
would be nothing more left for the miner, will never be for-
gotten. There were, however, many clear-headed practical


men on the field, who from the conformation of the strata
near the surface thought that by sinking deeper other
similar formations of quartz would be found, and long before
this idea gained general acceptance, it was vigorously and
strongly urged upon the miners in the Bendigo Advertiser
by its present editor Mr. R. R. Haverfield, and by several
others. The first shafts sunk to test this idea where looked
upon by a great many as crack-brained projects. And years
after, when payable reefs had been found down to 600 or 7°°
feet, or even 1000 feet, still a good proportion were simply
waiting for the end to come. How well the predictions of
the few, and how greatly have been upset the profound
scientific promulgations of 33 or 34 years ago needs no further
comment now that gold has been found in our quartz mines
down to 2100 feet. Since the discovery five or six years
ago of a highly payable reef on the New Chum line at 1760
feet, and following discoveries of payable quartz at equal
or greater depths, there has been no person bold enough to
give public voice to any assertion of the limit in depth of
our golden treasures.
The quartz era did not prove such a fleeting one as the
alluvial. For all the 34 or 35 years since reefs were first
worked, progress has been the order of the day, and the old
primitive appliances have given way to machinery of the
most powerful and approved type. The industry is
established on a very sound basis, and the discoveries made
in the deep ground show conclusively that there is a
permanent future before the field, and that for many, very
many years to come, it will occupy the leading position in
the district’s industries. Although many mines are getting
very deep on the main lines of reef, and the greater portion


of the work is upon those lines, they do not represent more
than a very small proportion of the auriferous area available
for working. Mining operations cannot be extended beyond
the limit of the capital available, and the great bulk of local
capital is taken up in working on the lines mentioned.
There are however, miles upon miles of proved reefs—the
surface formations of many of which were very rich —which
are not at all or very slightly worked, and these are lying
dormant as a reserve for the future.
The area, of the “ Sandhurst mining district ” is 5870
square miles, with several mining centres in various portions
of it. The figures given below however relate strictly to the
Sandhurst district proper, that is the portion in and
immediately surrounding the city. In this district the area
actually worked upon is about seven square miles, and 4000
miners are employed. There are no less than 276 reefs, or
rather lines of reef, many of which are awaiting capital to
work them. The lines of reef run north and south through
the country for miles. The present leading reef in the
district is being worked for about eight miles in length.
The reefs are known as saddle formations, having a cap and
two legs going down diagonally east and west much like an
inverted V (thus A). The reefs are of various thicknesses,
and run down for from 50 to 200 feet in depth generally.
As soon as one formation is worked out, the shaft is sunk,
and another similar formation is found below the previous
one. Up to the present, despite all the predictions of
scientist and geologists, gold-bearing reefs have been traced
to 2100 feet in depth, and there are indications of reefs lower
still, so that no one can say to what depths they will be
traced. It is intended by Mr. G. Lansell—the “ Quartz


King of Australia” —to sink the shaft of the “ No. 180 ”
mine—now the deepest in the district —to 3000 feet, so that,
in the immediate future, the ground will be tested at far
greater depths than anywhere in Australia, or, in fact, than
in any gold-mining country in the world. There is, of
course, as much likelihood of the reefs continuing to 4000 or
5000 feet as 2100 feet, and nothing that science can teach,
or geology can tell, can be urged against this assumption.
Nothing but real actual work can tell where the limit exists.
There is one point in this connection which should be
brought under the notice of capitalists desiring means of in-
vestment. The State Government has for many years had
a watchful eye on the gold-fields, and all facts likely, after
strict scrutiny, to be of value hereafter are carefully recorded
and published. The Governmental scrutiny shows that in a
very small area around Sandhurst there are no less than
276 quartz reefs, that is, there are so many “ distinct reefs,”
traversing perhaps miles of country north and south, in
this immediate district (see Government mining reports for
quarter ending March 31, 1888). Now, we know that
nearly all these reefs were payable, and a large proportion
very rich, at the surface. And we know, also, that five or
six lines, near the centre of the district, have —by chance, to
a very large extent —been selected for extensive operations,
and that the three of them most fully occupied by claims
and in regular work have been regarded for years as the
“mainlines,” simply so-called from popular predilection
and the “chances” before mentioned. Now, these three
lines have been in steady continuous work ever since
quartz mining was inaugurated here, and have returned
vast sums in profits to the shareholders. Now, had any


other lines been brought forward by the “ chance ” referred
to, they might have had an equally good, or, perhaps, in-
finitely better, record to show. It may be asked—lf this is
true, why were they not worked ? In the first place, the
limited capital previously referred to is the main obstacle.
Human beings are notoriously gregarious, and they are
none the less so when associated in mining companies. In
mining, it is distinctly an advantage to have numerous
“ neighbours,” as not only is the water difficulty, serious
when only one or two companies are working on one line,
reduced to a minimum, but the prospecting of several com-
panies in one locality gives the benefit of a fortunate dis-
covery in one to all the others. This explains why mining
investors like to stick to a line of reef which is being worked
by numerous other companies, and why certain lines have
come to be termed “mainlines ” for no other reason. This
brings us back to the leading argument. A number of
reefs equally rich in the surface formations with those now
in full work are nearly or entirely neglected. It seems
reasonable to think that these would as well have paid for
opening up as those which have been continuously worked,
and the only reason why they have not been so worked is
the want of capital ; all the available supply being, for
reasons above stated, diverted into certain localities. There
are thousands upon thousands of acres upon such reefs now
available. The only charge for mining upon these lands is
the nominal fee of five shillings per acre per annum. As an
instance, it may be mentioned that two or three years ago
a claim was taken up in one of these neglected localities,
and, after the shareholders spent £3OOO or £4OOO, they were
rewarded by finding a reef, from which the first month's


work gave a clear profit of with every probability of
similar profits for a long time to come. It must be under-
stood that, though the reef formations continue regularly,
they do not all carry payable gold, and it sometimes costs
£lO,OOO or £20,000, or more, and perhaps some little time,
before a profitable reef can be found, but when the return
does come it comes quickly and abundantly.

OUR CONTRIBUTION TO THE WORLD’S WEALTH.
After saying so much about our quartz and alluvia
mines, it may not be out of place to give some particulars
as to the returns of gold won from the earth during the
thirty-seven years which have elapsed since gold was first
found. The figures are all well-authenticated, being
issued (under Governmental auspices) from sworn returns
by the various banks.
From November, 1851 (when gold was first discovered
at Bendigo) to August, 1888, the total amount of gold ob-
tained was 14,851,121 ozs, valued at which
amount this small area of a few square miles has since
added to the world’s wealth ; for, be it remembered, money
made in gold-mining is not like that made in any other
business, simply a transference from one pocket to another,
but actually new wealth, which never before existed, won
from Mother Earth. As about four-fifths of this gold
found its way to London, it may be imagined that our
fifty-nine millions had no little share in promoting Eng-
land’s prosperity.


The Bendigo gold-field, besides being the most produc-
tive in the aggregate, has also returned by far the larger
earning per man of any gold-field in Australia.

A FEW SUCCESSFUL QUAETZ MINES.
A reader who has followed us thus far should be in-
terested in a very brief glance at the history of a few of
our more successful mines, and in doing so they should
note specially the small proportion of the called-up capi-
tal to the profits divided ; the comparatively small area
from which this result has been obtained; and the
merely nominal amount which has to be paid for the oc-
cupation of such area. More successful companies have
been in existence than many of those named below ; but,
owing to changes in ownership, amalgamation with
other claims, loss of records, and other reasons, it is im-
possible to secure the reliable data necessary in such
cases.
GARDEN GULLY UNITED COMPANY.
This is the premier mining company in this district, its
success having been the most remarkable of any venture
during the thirty-five years’ history of quartz mining in
this district. The company holds forty-two acres of
ground, with a length upon the line of reef of 620 yards,
and from this area —for the occupation of which they pay
the Government the nominal rent of £lO 10s. (ss. per
acre) per annum —there has been derived, in twenty-nine


years, the handsome profit of over a million sterling. In
the early days of quartz reefing, the ground now held by
the company was passed over by the prospectors as being
unworthy of notice, and it was not till several years after
quartz reefing had been established that an effort at pros-
pecting was made. The ground was then taken up in a
number of small claims held by working miners. Some of
these obtained good yields at shallow levels. One party
of five men derived a profit of £9OOO in eighteen months
from a reef ninety feet below the surface. Later on,
when shafts had to be sunk below water level, these claims
were all taken over by the present company, which was
formed in 1865. At first, the company’s career was the
reverse of brilliant, and, after a few years’ non-success,
many shareholders grew disheartened and thousands of
shares were forfeited for the non-payment of threepenny
calls, the holders not realising the fortunes they were
throwing away. In 1868, the inauguration of a brighter
period took place. In order to avert total collapse, the
ground was let in several tribute blocks, the tributors
paying the original company per cent, of all gold won.
The history of these tributes was of a sensational charac-
ter. The whole of these tributes spent only £12,666, and,
in addition to the percentage they had to pay, distributed
no less than £220,875 in dividends. The No. 1 Tribute
crushed 9033 tons for 17,144 ozs. gold, and paid 275. 6d.
per share in dividends. The No. 2 Tribute in about a
year crushed 3573 tons for the splendid yield of 24,474
ozs. gold, and paid 595. 6d. per share, or £70,656 55., in
dividends. The No. 3 Tribute crushed 2898 tons for
17,709 ozs., and paid 435. per share, or £51,062 10s., in


dividends. The No. 4 Tribute paid £6531 55.; and the
Rainbow Tribute, £9500 in dividends. In 1874, the origi-
nal company resumed possession, and has been paying
dividends ever since. The company only expended of
their capital £21,646, and has since paid £700,000, so
that it is unnecessary to invite attention to the enormous
return on the outlay. The company and tributes ob-
tained altogether considerably over 300,000 ozs. gold,
and have paid in dividends £920,000. The company
possesses a plant valued at £IO,OOO. Adding to the
dividends paid by the company, those of private owners,
and other profits, it will be seen that this one claim alone
has yielded a profit of over a million.
GREAT EXTENDED HUSTLER’S COMPANY.
This is another of our leading companies; and, were
the whole of the results from the ground available, the
profits derived would probably be found to exceed in
amount those of the claim previously mentioned. How-
ever, in the early days the ground was held by a number
of small companies and private owners, and the only
official records obtainable are those of the present com-
pany. Gold was first found here in 1853 by one of a
numerous party of African blacks, who had found their
way to the diggings, having deserted from some ship in
port. Later on a number of small companies sprang up,
and these claims were all very rich. From one of them,
fully half a million pounds worth of gold was obtained.
In 1865, all these claims were absorbed by the present
company, which has since produced an enormous quan-


tity of gold. In the early seventies, the immense yields
of gold obtained from here made the name of the Hustler’s
line world-famous. The ground held was partly worked
by the company itself and partly by a tribute company.
Each of these was very successful, and from the reef
between 300 and 600 feet they obtained highly sensational
yields, as much as 4000 ozs. of gold being obtained in a
fortnight, and dividends of from £ISOO to £14,000 being
paid each fortnight. From this reef alone, the Company,
on a called-up capital of only £17,200, paid £363,000;
and the tribute company, on a paid-up capital of only
£28,700, paid £194,600 in dividends. Since then, the
company has sunk its shaft to 2020 feet, and is now
paying regular dividends from a reef at 1800 and 1900
feet; and the Tribute shaft to 1770 feet, and they are
also working payable stone. The total dividends paid by
the two companies to date amount to £570,000. They
pay altogether only £24 a year lease rent.
When His Royal Highness Prince Alfred was in Aus-
tralia, he was entertained in a most novel manner in one
portion of this claim.' In a large cavern, formed by taking
out the reef, 400 feet below the surface, a floor was laid
and the visitors entertained at a magnificent banquet.
THE UNITED DEVONSHIRE COMPANY.
This company has had quite a latter day reputation, as
it is only a comparatively few years since it was exten-
sively worked, but its history was of a truly sensational
character. After working about nine or ten years, the


company found a very rich reef between 400 and 600 feat,
which yielded for a long time as high as from 2000 ozs.
to 3000 ozs. a fortnight. In one fortnight, they paid back
in dividends more than twice as much as the whole of
their previously called-up capital. They paid altogether
in dividends, while the whole of their called-up
capital only amounts to For this rich claim
they only pay the Government an annual rent of £ r 17s.
6d.
THE JOHNSON’S REEF COMPANY.
This claim has also a great record, the surface having
been very rich. Like most of the larger of the present
companies, their ground in the early times was in a large
number of claims, so that exact records are not now ob-
tainable ; but it is estimated that the former owners
derived a profit of and the present company has
paid /i 55,000 in dividends, besides the erection of very
extensive machinery.
THE FREDERICK THE GREAT COMPANY.
This claim is situated some distance from the “ main
lines,” and had it not been for the accidental discovery of
rich golden quartz on the surface by some woodsplitters in
1862 it might still be portion of the extensive auriferous
areas lying unworked, waiting for the necessary supply of
capital. Since then, however, the ground has been ener-
getically worked, and has yielded, partly to private
owners and partly to the present company of profit of


about It is a remarkable fact that the company,
which itsell paid over /'ioo.ooo in dividends, only called
up of its capital.
THE VICTORY AND PANDORA COMPANY.
This company, whose main shaft is down 2300 feet—
the second deepest in the district,—intends to sink to
3000 feet. Owing to the heavy outlay in sinking, their
called-up capital, about is much heavier than
usual with our companies. The upper formation was,
however, very rich, and they paid in dividends.
The lease rent for the 17 acres held by this company is
£\ Bs. per annum.
THE PEARL COMPANY.
This is one of the “ modern ” successes of the field.
The ground was allowed to remain idle for years ; but,
about eight years since, the present company went
pluckily to work, and sank the shaft to 1000 feet without
getting any payable stone. Their whole capital was
and of this they spent before meeting
with success. They now have a large payable reef, which
will take years to work out, and have already paid
in dividends.
OTHER SUCCESSFUL COMPANIES.
This list could be prolonged indefinitely, as there are
scores upon scores of other companies who have as good


or better records than many of those mentioned. For
instance, the North Johnsons, with dividends £103,000,
and capital called up £15,000; New Chum and Victoria,
dividends £112,112, capital called up £17,000; South
St. Mungo, dividends £59,000, capital called up £10,000;
Hercules and Energetic, dividends, £59,000, capital called
up £BOOO ; Ellesmere, dividends £89,950, capital called
up £20,000; New Chum Consolidated, dividends
£115,000, capital called up £II,OOO ; Belmont, dividends
£105,000, capital called up £4000; and scores of others
with equally good records.
