The woman s part! Can any of
us tell where it begins, where
ends ? Full of inspiration,
tenderness, love and pity; she
works and works and knows no
rest. Nor will she, till the bells
of Peace ring out.

O o the Blontnt of (Bitr (Empire
Oh! women of our Empire, dream your
dreams,
Hold fast your visions of the things to be,
And keep your high ideals ; still decree
To sink in growing hearts and minds, the
themes
That will inspire great deeds. For thus, it
seems
In ages past, sweet mothers at the knee,
Instilled the truths that made the British
free;
Instilled the truths that realised great dreams
Of Empire. Unity of deed and thought
Upholding justice, liberty and peace,
And still, oh ! great unlaurelled queens, you
sway
Our destinies, and do your part unsought,
Unsung, e’en while your spirits speed in
cease-
less dread, along the battle’s blood-girt way.




SLEEP
“ They sleep, but whence their souls ? (for
surely man’s
Immortal soul can neither sleep nor dream)
Are they fast bound to earth or free to roam ?
And if set free do they expand, and where ?”
These thoughts arose, as wearily I gazed
Upon the sleeping town, and then anon
A baby’s plaintive cry fell on the night,
And when the purple shadows deepened and
The moonlight waned, unto her casement came
The mother with her restless child, and then
I heard her sing in cadence low, sweet words
That gave an answer to my thought. She
sang:—


Sciilptored by
Margaret Tiaskerville


Oh, hush! my babe against my breast,
And God will send his angel sleep
To lull thee, dear, to perfect rest,
While saints thy soul in heav’n shall keep.
Oh, hush! my babe, and sweet thy dreams,
For soon thy soul set free shall rise
To heights above, where angel themes
Shall mingle with earth’s lullabys.
Oh hush ! my babe e’er dawns the day,
Sleep, sleep while heavenly voices sing
The slumber song that bore away
The Christ-Child’s soul on Angel wing.
Oh, hush ! sleep on, and with the morn
That dimpling smiling face of thine
Shall bring within our home the dawn
Of heaven’s light and love divine.




The sweet voice sank upon a murmurous note,
And so I know, the child slept on. And hope,
Like notes of melody, distinct and clear,
And true, sang in my heart. If sleep lets free
The soul, then may not mine (absolved from sin
E’er sleep mine eyelids close) ascend to where
In higher plane, are those I mourn ; those
souls
Who e’er progress, though termed by some
“ the dead,”
And when I wake, subconsciously, perchance
I’ll know, my soul has been awhile released
From this world’s tragedies, and, borne upon
The wings of night, has held communion with
Great souls and dear whose bonds hath death
unloosed,
And though I’ll not have seen, I’ll know my
Has felt them near, and felt the holy calm
Of Christ’s own presence and the wondrous
touch
That heals our wounds, and wipes away
our tears.
