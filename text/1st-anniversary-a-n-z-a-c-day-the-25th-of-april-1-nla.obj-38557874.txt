Knitting
by Ella Wheeler Wilcox
AT the concert and the play,
Everywhere you see them sitting,
Knitting, knitting,
Women who the other day
Thought of nothing but their frocks,
Or their jewels, or their locks,
Women who have lived for pleasure,
Who have known no work but leisure,
Now are knitting, knitting, knitting,
For the soldiers over there.
On the trains and on the ships,
With a diligence befitting,
They are knitting,
Some with smiles upon their lips,
Some with manner debonair.
Some with earnest look and air.
But each heart, in its own fashion,
Weaves in pity and compassion,
In their knitting, knitting, knitting.
For the soldiers over there.
Hurried women to and fro,
From their homes to labour flitting,
Knitting, knitting,
Busy-handed come and go.
Broken bits of time they spare,
Just to feel they do their-share.
Just to keep life’s sense of beauty
In the sharing of its duty,
They are knitting, knitting, knitting,
For the soldiers over there.


A MUSICAL CONCERT
will be held in
THE BRIGADE LINES
at 730 p.m
