Hawkesbury Agricultural Association Committee.
HAWKESBURY DISTRICT AGRICULTURAL ASSOCIATION.
This Society first formed in 1843, and is one of the most popular and prosperous in
the colony. Its Annual Show is held on the Hawkesbury Racecourse on the three last
days of the second week in May. In addition to numerous special prizes, the Society
offer prizes for 633 distinct classes, the total money offered being £7OO, in round
numbers. 3000 entries were received in 1904. That this Society is faithfully carrying
out, to a great extent, the objects for which it was formed, cannot be doubted. By the
bringing together of the many exhibits, and the comparing the same in the several
classes, much useful knowledge is disseminated. It is also the means of bringing the
district into greater prominence, it conduces greatly to a more happy and social feeling
among the scattered residents ; for within the extended area of the district there are
many whose conscientious scruples would not allow them to attend an ordinary sporting
gathering, yet who do not hesitate to regularly attend the annual show.
To Colonel Holborrow, M.P., lies the credit of re-forming this Society, for as Mayor
of Richmond, he, in September, 1879, convened (upon his own responsibility), a public-
meeting in the School of Arts, Richmond, which was held on the 25th of that month,
and was attended by about 150 of the residents of Richmond and Windsor. After-
considerable discussion, it was unanimously resolved, upon the motion of Mr. Thomas
Primrose, Mayor of Windsor, “ That in the opinion of this meeting it is desirable that
an Agricultural Association be formed, and that it be called the ‘ Hawkesbury District
Agricultural Association.’ ” Other resolutions being moved by Messrs. R. H. Ducker,
C. J. Pitt, F. J. Gow and Wm. Gosper. At this meeting Mr. C. S. Guest was appointed
Secretary, a position he has since held continuously. The first show was held on the
29th and 30th April, and Ist May, 1880.
President, Captain Charley ; Vice-Presidents, Messrs. N. Hall, B. Hall, A. Tucker-
man, J. Devlin, J. J. Paine, G. Nicholls ; Treasurer, E. H. Street, and a Council of 42.

CULTURAL GUIDE.
Kitchen Garden. —Sow beet, carrot, turnip, peas, spinach, parsnip,
French beans, brocoli, cabbage, broad beans ; plant potatoes, cabbages,
cauliflowers, artichokes, rhubarb, and all kinds of culinary herbs ; mulch
asparagus with good old manure ; let the air freely circulate ; at this season
great advantage would be gained by sowing the land with salt at the rate
of 3 or 4 lbs. to the perch, it tends to sweeten the land and destroy the
insects.
Flower Garden. —Seeds of all kinds may now be sown ; the tenderest
kinds, such as balsams and cockscombs, on a hot bed, or towards the end of
the month a few may be tried in the open ground. Plant out from the
reserve ground all kinds of herbaceous plants in pots ; transplant lilies
and similar bulbs.
Orchard. —Plant bananas, citron, lime, orange, lemon, fig, guava,
apple, loquat, and deciduous fruit trees of all kinds. Every effort should
be made to finish transplanting by the end of it he month.
The Field. —Prepare land for maize and summer growing crops.
Sow tobacco in seed beds, and protect from frost. Sow sorghum sacchar-
atum in seed beds for planting out ; transplant when six inches high, in
rows three feet apart ; let the plants be one foot from each other.

DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING A WILL.
It is imperative on all, however small their estate, to make a Will.
When persons die intestate, having foolishly put off making a
Will until it is too late, their negligence may deprive those they were
most anxious to benefit of the results of a life-long struggle.
A Will cannot be made in language too simple or concise. Must
be written with ink on Paper or Parchment, and signed at the end by the
Testator, in the presence of two or more witnesses, who must not be
parties interested in the Will ; if written on more than one sheet, the
Testator and the Witnesses should sign erch sheet. The witnesses
must rigidly comply with every particular required by the Attestation
Clause, at the end of which clause they must sign their names. The
signature of the Testator must be acknowledged by him in the presence
of the witnesses, and he should (after signing) take the Will in his hand,
and say : “ I acknowledge this to be my last Will and Testament, and
request you to witness it.”
Form of Will for Absolute Devise.
This is the last Will and Testament of me
of
I hereby revoke all Wills by me at any time heretofore made. I
appoint to be my Execut
and direct that all my just debts and funeral and testamentary expenses
sha 1 be paid as soon as conveniently may be after decease.
I give, devise, and bequeath unto
for his (or her) absolute use and benefit all my real and personal estate
wherever situated.
In witness whereof, I, the said
have to this my last Mull and Testament set my name this
day of in the year of our Lord one thousand
nine hundred and
Attestation Clause.
Signed by the Testator, and acknow-
ledged by h. ...to be h... . last Will and
Testament, in the presence of us, present
at the same time, who, at h. . . . request,
in h. ... presence and in the presence of
each other, have subscribed our names as
witnesses.
Marriage after making a Will renders the Will void.
A Mhtness need not know the contents of a Will, which may be
folded so that the signature and Attestation Clause alone can be seen.
A person who has been left a Legacy in the Will, or whose wife or
husband has been left a Legacy, should not be an attesting witness.
Their attestation wou’d be good, but they would forfeit the legacy.

Some thirty years ago, when boat-races were frequent on the Shoal-
haven River, Messrs. James and William Kennedy, Z. G. Bice, and Angus
Munro worked together on the north side of the river getting out timber.
A regatta was announced in which they proposed to engage, being
anxious that the two Kennedys should enter for the two-oared race. But
they had no boat. They decided to build one, just a week before the
regatta was to be held/ They felled a cedar tree (on Monday) from
which they built the craft and had it placed in the water on the fol-
lowing Monday morning. And in this boat the two Kennedys rowed
the race and won it.
The ship Walter Hood, from Aberdeen, was wrecked at Wreck Bay,
between Sussex Inlet and Ulladulla, 26th April, 1870. The captain
(A. Latto), a passenger (Mr. Haynes), and three seamen (J. Sinclair,
J. Mayes, and John Julian), were drowned. Their bodies were recov-
ered, and buried in an enclosed area near by. Mr. Lovegrove, C.P.S.,
Nowra, erected timbers over the graves with the names of the deceased
engraved thereon.

ACCEPTED DESIGN OF NEW PAVILION AT NOWRA SHOW GROUND
THE SHOALHAVEN DISTRICT.
WHAT fertile land on the surface of the globe has ever long lacked
inhabitants, whatever their color might be ? It needs no con-
juror to say why in the earliest days of Australian settlement
Illawarra acquired a band of hardy pioneers, for the aborigines had
found the country before them, and are still amongst us. The native
settled all through the great Commonwealth that is to be, where it was
easiest to live, and his white successor has but followed in his tracks.
Perhaps all over the vast continent of Australia the white man found
nothing better suited to his taste and purpose than that grand tract
of bursting fertility lying between Gerringong and Jervis Bay, and
intersected by the serpentine and rich river-flat producing Shoalhaven.
On the other hand, the “ Garden of New South Wales ” has to be thank-
ful that much of it fell into the hands of a man utterly unselfish, and
who was followed by a successor with all his virtues, the aims of both
of whom were not so much to acquire wealth as to spread happiness.
It is for this reason that to-day there are many families with a local


ancestry of three generations, all spent or passing on the same spot
where the parent stock first took local root. And in no district of New
South Wales is to be found a grander counterfeit presentment of the
old English yeomanry, famous from Agincourt to to-day.
The district, watered by one of the finest streams in Australia,
is one of the most fertile and productive. No other district contains
a happier and more peaceable people. The history of its early settle-
ment, and of its progress is virtually the history of the Shoalhaven (or
Berry) Estate, of which the district for the greater part consists. As
was some time ago observed by a distinguished writer in Dalgety’s
Review, “ the past history of the Berry Estate is indissolubly linked
to the history of the first settlers of this continent, dating back as it
does to the dawn of the nineteenth century, and embracing many chap-

ditions that less resolute pioneers might have considered insuperable.”

of the word, but a great institution of learning, possess: ig a curriculum
which yields all the theoretical—and certainly more of the practical —
advantages of a great agricultural college. It is a school in the finest
sense of the word : one that is working out many of the intricate prob-
lems of human existence on the soundest scientific principles, that those
who dwell amongst its fertile hills and valleys may be adequately forti-
fied in the struggle against a keen competitive world. It is an estate
only in the meaning of the word as it describes broad acres, for there
is a community dwelling on it numbering over 5000 souls —sober,
peaceful, industrious ; a community enlightened in all the complex
questions inseparably associated with their progressive industry, and
obtaining the maximum yield for their product at a minimum of cost.
It may be said at once, and without fear of contradiction, that the soil
dwellers who revolve around this progressive institution obtain more
for their staple product than any other organised dairying community
in Australia ; and this, not because of better conditions of tenure than
prevail elsewhere, or of superior soil, but simply for the reason that the
community has been transformed into an up-to-date school of modern
dairying, toiling, as it does, in the steady light of science, and distribu-
ting the products of its labour on fixed commercial principles to the
four corners of the earth.
The early adventures of Mr. Alexander Berry, who settled at Cool-
angatta in 1822, have been recorded in many parts of the world, being
deeply interesting. Mr. Alex. Berry was a native of Cupar, Fifeshire,
Scotland, educated at the Universities of St. Andrew’s and Edinburgh,
with the view to qualifying himself as a surgeon, entered the service of
the Hon. East India Company, and made many voyages to India and
China in the capacity of surgeon, his last voyage being in the Lord
Hawkesbury, with a detachment of the 17th Regiment, returning to
England in that capacity with the wreck of a regiment which had been
at the battle of Assaye under Sir Arthur Wellesley. After this voyage,
Mr. Berry engaged in mercantile pursuits, and proceeded to the Cape of
Good Hope, which had then just been taken from the Dutch. At the
Cape he purchased a prize ship, which he named the City of Edinburgh,
and entered into a commercial venture, with a cargo of provisions for
the colony of New South Wales, then short of supplies by reason of
the great flood in the Hawkesbury, which had destroyed all the crops
of the settlers. The City of Edinburgh , 526 tons, left the Cape on Sept. 4th,
1807, and having lost her main and mizzen masts on the 12th Sept., the
rest of the voyage was made under jury masts. Captain Berry reached
Sydney after a perilous voyage, on 13th January, 1808, and shortly
afterwards proceeded to New Zealand, arriving at the Bay of Islands
in March, 1809. Owing to a heavy leak he had to discharge cargo,
hove the vessel down, completely stripped her of her copper, and re-
sheathed with New Zealand pine. Completing repairs, he proceeded to
Fiji Islands for sandalwood, returning to the Bay of Islands, N.Z., in
October, where he heard of the destruction at Whangaroa of the ship

owners (Oct. 20th, 1810). Mr. Berry proceeded to the scene of the
massacre and rescued the survivors—a woman, Mrs. Morley, whose
daughters subsequently kept a school in Sydney ; a girl, and two boys.
One of these latter (Thomas Davidson), was in 1822 drowned at the
Shoalhaven Heads through the upsetting of a boat in the breakers ;
and the girl, Miss Broughton, after whom Broughton River was named,
afterwards married Mr. Charles Throsby, a wealthy settler, of Bong
Bong, Berrima District. Completing the loading of the City of Edin-
burgh with spars, Mr. Berry resumed his voyage, the port finally reached
being, as he put it, “ the bottom of the Atlantic,” the vessel having foun-
dered at sea. He visited the Azores, and went thence to Portugal and
Spain. While in the latter country he was present at the bombardment
of Cadiz by Soult, whose military genius he ever afterwards held in very
great contempt. At length he returned to New South W ales and settled
down here altogether as a colonist, being for many years one of the part-
ners of the respected firm of Berry and Wollstonecraft. He discovered
and explored the Shoalhaven District in the year 1820. Two years
later, he entered the Crookhaven River with the Royal George, a vessel
of 500 tons, chartered by him in London, and viewed the country-that
was destined, after nearly a century of persevering toil, to become what
we see it to-day. There is no man living in Shoalhaven who remembers
that day the pioneering vessel entered Crookhaven, nor is there one
who was in the district at the time. Still, one can look backwards
through the records that have been handed down to us and find many
narratives of the early vicissitudes of the pioneers who sailed in from
the sea to clear away the virgin forests, and reclaim the marshy lands
for settlement. Almost from the time Napoleon landed an exile on
St. Helena to the present day, that work has been going on, and if the
sum total of human industry expended in it could be expressed in money,
and added to the hard cash spent by those who have guided its destinies
from time to time, it might be found that the price paid was out of all
proportion to its present value. The writer of some geographical
memoirs, published in London in 1825, expressed doubt whether the
Messrs. Berry would ever be repaid for their outlay on the lands granted
to them. These pioneers, however, had determined upon a course, and
though their difficulties were great, the colonising spirit of the Anglo-
Saxon was in them, and they went on.
When Mr. Alex. Berry, with his partner, Edward Wollstonecraft
(a cousin of the famous Mary Wollstonecraft, whose daughter was mar-
ried to the poet Shelley), came toN.S.W.,it was customary for grants
of 2000 acres of land to be made under certain conditions to each settler.
In this way these two pioneers took up 3500 acres at Shoalhaven, the
remaining 500 acres of the grant being chosen by Mr. Wollstonecraft
at North Sydney, for residential purposes, where he erected a cottage
known as “ Crow’s Nest,” which is now occupied by Dr. John Hay.
The next lot of land (10,000 acres) secured at Shoalhaven was obtained
at a cost equal to £16,000, and the balance of the great Berry Estate
was secured by purchases by the brothers of Mr, Alexander Berry, as


much as £2l per acre having been paid the Government for some of it.
Much of the land was, however, subject to tidal influence and floods,
and, writing to the press thirty-eight years afterwards, Mr. Berry pointed
out that their bargain with the Government “ long made us objects of
ridicule,” and that “ it was at an expense unknown to the public that
we gave a value to the swamps of Shoalhaven no one had expected.”
Mr. Alex. Berry and his partner, Edward Wollstonecraft (who died in
1832), were the first hon. secretaries, acting jointly, of the Royal Agri-
cultural Society of N.S.W., Baron Field being the first President; and
for thirty years Mr. Berry was a member of the N.S.W. Legislative
Council. Mr. Alex. Berry died in 1873, in the 92nd year of his age, at
St. Leonard’s, North Sydney, where his remains were interred alongside
those of his wife, Elizabeth Wollstonecraft, and her brother, Edward
Wollstonecraft.

John, William, and David Berry joined their brother Alexander
Berry shortly after the original grants were taken up. They arrived
by the ship Midlothian , after a six months’ voyage, and were accompanied
by two sisters, Janet and Nancy, bringing with them a trusted follower,
Mr. Thomas Hall, who remained as manager of their cattle until his


death, after which, one of his sons (Mr. Peter Hall) for many years held
the position. John Berry attended exclusively to the breeding of stock
on the estate, and in those early days even, there was desire for a high-
class of cattle, it being on record that Mr. John Berry paid as much as
£5OO per head for bulls. He was killed by a fall from his horse at Moe-
yan. William Berry, and the two sisters, as well as Mr. Alex. Berry,
having passed away, Mr. David Berry became the sole survivor of this
historic family, and inherited the accumulated properties of his brothers,
in all some 60,500 acres. He died at Coolangatta in 1889, at the ad-
vanced age of 94, much lamented by the community amongst whom
he had laboured for so many years. It was he who extended the ten-
antry system to the estate, which was originally worked on the “ halves ”
system. The gathering of over 2000 persons at Mr. David Berry’s
burial in the private cemetery on a beautiful south-eastern slope of
Coolangatta, was a memorable meeting, and the encomiastic addresses
delivered on the occasion by local clergy and other speakers found
general endorsement, especially by the people around the landlord’s
hospitable homestead, who realised that by Mr. Berry’s death they had
lost the best friend they ever had. As the deceased was a truly kind
and benevolent man, though of a retiring and unassuming disposition,
so was he an intensely pious man. Ministers of religion who knew him
personally have stated that Mr. Berry’s religious belief was of a most
deeply devout character, and that few men studied the bible more or
knew it better than he did. Among the last expressions of the deceased
were : “I find more comfort and consolation in the bible than in all
else beside. In thrilling interest it surpasses'all the novels ever written,
and in all respects concerning the true welfare of man, as regards this
world and the world to come, all other books bear no comparison to it.”
The Berrys were greatly assisted in the settlement by the late Henry
Gordon Morton, who was agent for the estate for thirty-five years, and
who did much as a practical surveyor to locate farms, establish roads
and ferries, and generally settle the tenantry on a sound basis. Since
his decease this work has been successively attended to by his sons,
Messrs. Philip and Harry Morton, who have discharged their duties
with judgment and ability. The aspect of affairs on the Berry Estate
after the death of Mr. David Berry underwent a complete change.
Up to this period the estate had no encumbrances which its natural
sources of revenue were not able to meet. Indeed, the policy both of
Mr. Alexander Berry and Mr. David Berry was to increase the extent
of the estate as opportunity offered, and this they found little trouble
in doing, once the initial difficulties had been surmounted. The well-
meaning enterprise of Mr. Alex. Berry in the direction of improving the
estate cost him the loss of a large slice of most valuable land. When
he first entered the Crookhaven he found that navigation by the Shoal-
haven Heads was impossible owing to the shoals with which the entrance
was dotted ; and so he cut a canal —actually the first canal cut in Aus-
tralia —since grown to be as wide and deep as the river, running north
and south, and connecting the Shoalhaven River with the more satis-

factory Crookhaven River entrance. In doing this he made an island
of the intervening land, comprising 700 acres of good soil, and known
now as Comerong ; and it was subsequently taken by Government,
subdivided into farms, and sold to various farmers at advanced prices,
the principal purchaser being Mr. James Kennedy, who came with his
parents from Ireland in 1837, and was for some time in Mr. Alex. Berry’s
service.
Since the death of Mr. David Berry, the estate, which was be-
queathed to his cousin, Dr. John Hay (whose portrait appears amongst
the illustrations in this volume), has been wonderfully developed and
improved. Fifteen thousand acres of swamp land have been reclaimed,
and a further area of 10,000 acres made available for pasturage on the
adjoining ridges, enabling the residuary legatee to pay the enormous
legacies which the last of the Berrys had so munificently willed. These
included £IOO,OOO to erect and endow a hospital in the town of Berry ;
£IOO,OOO as endowment to the University of St. Andrew’s, Scotland ;
and £30,000 to the Presbyterian Church Sustentation Fund, N.S.W;
No likeness of either Mr. Alex, or Mr. David Berry can be found in either
public or private records of their lives, which fact the writer sincerely
regrets. Neither Mr. David Berry, nor any of his brothers or sisters
who came to this country (except Alexander, who left no children),
was ever married. David was thus the last of his race.
In the early years of South Coast settlement the Shoalhaven
remained for a period but little known, the entrance to the river—
simply a shifting sandbank —being avoided by shipping until the cutting
of the canal that made a passage from the Crookhaven to the Shoalhaven,
as mentioned before. The principal southern shipping ports at that time
were Wollongong, Jervis Bay, and Eden (Twofold Bay), and the small
vessels belonging to the Berry Estate farmers frequently, before the
canal was cut, had to take refuge in Crookhaven to await favorable
opportunity to enter the Shoalhaven Heads, the delays thus occasioned
being of considerable inconvenience to the young settlement at Coolan-
gatta.
Strenuous efforts were made to establish Jervis Bay as a shipping
port, and a company ran a steamer there for some time. The township
of New Bristol, in the south-east corner of the bay, and of which no sign
now remains, excepting some foundation-stones, was frequently visited
by whalers, whose vessels were provisioned settlers. Exports
from the bay consisted chiefly of wool, tallow, etc., which were conveyed
from Braidwood and Queanbeyan districts by a road which descended
the mountain by Wandandian, and which was popularly known as the
“ Wool Road.” The line of road is still to be seen, though it is now
but little used. Jervis Bay affords a striking example of the manner
in which we can afford to dispense with the natural advantages so freely
bestowed on this State. It is almost an inland lake, about eight miles
long in a northerly direction, and from three to five and a half miles
wide. Everywhere there is ample water for a large ship to float. There
are two roads where vessels can anchor securely during bad weather,


‘ . , • ; . - .
and the sandy beach, which runs almost entirely round the bay, pro-
vides good landing places. Yet the chief use to which the harbour is
put is as a practising place for men-of-war. The timber trade and
ship-building industry established the village of Huskisson, at the mouth
of Currumbene Creek. Mr. George Dent was the principal pioneer of
Jervis Bay, and he and his sons, who still reside there, have built many
a trim craft for the coasting trade and Sydney harbour purposes. The
entrance to the Bay is guarded by the barren Bowen Island, which was
examined some years ago by the defence authorities with the view to
making fortifications there. The North Head of the Bay is known as
Point Perpendicular, the sharply-defined profile of which is a feature of
the coast line. The mail steamer Chimborazo ran on the rocks at the
foot of this head on January 9th, 1881, but was floated off again.

At the time the first agriculturists began to tickle the land about
Coolangatta (or Cooloomgatta, as it was originally called), Nowra was
quite unknown ; but in several years time a settlement was formed at
Worrigee, otherwise known as Boston, south of and forming part of the
Terara Estate. Amongst the earliest buildings was a slab structure
for a school, the first teacher of which was a Mr. Rose, who subsequently
held the position of cashier to the Water and Sewerage Board.


The postal business of the Shoalhaven district was conducted at
Coolangatta by the late James Lamond, about the year 1850 ; and a
post-office was, a few years afterwards, established at Numba, in charge
of the late J. S. Lang.
In 1852, residents of Brundie, mostly potato growers, moved to
lease from Mr. Berry farm lands between Numba and the Terara boun-
dary. Pyree, then known as “ Swamp Paddock,” was quickly changed
from a sheep run to agricultural farms. The north bank of the river
was also occupied by farmers, who were in the years to come to have
good additions of arable land by the systematic drainage, the advan-
tages of which are so apparent to-day. Crown lands being for a long
time unobtainable, and the inquiry for it so urgent, a land league was
ultimately formed to urge the Government to place the people in the
way of making homes for themselves, by throwing open the Crown
lands. This agitation resulted, ten years afterwards, in the formation
of the town of Nowra. The Government sent down a surveyor (Mr.
Legge) to select the place, but he was drowned in the river. Another
surveyor took up the work and completed it. At that time Nowra
was mere bush. There was not a single house. It lay dormant for a
number of years, and many of the allotments could have been bought for
a mere song. The land around Nowra Hill and Cambewarra was sur-
veyed and offered for sale by auction at Numba, at which place the local
Petty Sessions Court was held monthly. The late Mr. A. K. McKay
was appointed Crown Lands Commissioner, with residence at Nowra

Park —the scene of many social gatherings in those days —and the first
sale of Nowra land took place in 1853, and realised good prices, con-
siderable interest in the enterprise being manifested by Coast people.
The late Mr. George Tory was one of the first to build and reside in
Nowra, and he early commenced business as a builder and cabinet
maker. As the main south-coast road lay some miles to the east, in
a position now quite out of the line of traffic, Nowra’s progress in devel-
opment was slow. In time, however, a ferry was established at Boma-
derry, and the Government opened a road from the ferry through
Nowra to meet the South Coast road near The Falls. Simultaneously
a courthouse was erected in Nowra, and gradually the transaction of
public business became centred in this place. In 1860 the entrepot of
the district’s commercial life was Adam’s Wharf (Terara), which had
become a most attractive and thriving township, assisted largely by
the De Mestres’ Estate, but was almost entirely destroyed by the flood
of that year. Successive floods, especially those of 1870 and 1871:,
destructively demonstrated the fact that Terara was not the most suit-
able place for a township. Nowra, being well situated on high land,
offered the necessary security from invasion by flood waters, and so
became the choice of many people for residential as well as business
purposes. The completion of the bridge over the Shoalhaven River
strengthened the desire of business people in Terara to leave the flood-
subjected town, and, in fact, it altered the whole geography of the dis-
trict, to the advancement of Nowra, in a comparatively short time.
The people used to get across the river by ferries —of which there were
four, Bomaderry, Sackley’s, Stewart’s, and Numba, —and in flood time
for days they could not get across at all. Once the river was bridged,
however, a traffic came over it which gave the town of Nowra a healthy
start, and assured its permanent prosperity.
In 1850 a Presbyterian denominational school was established at
Numba in a “ cabbage-tree ” building, which was also used for the ser-
vices of the Established Presbyterian Church, under the pastorate of
the Rev, J. H. Garvan, who afterwards removed to one of the northern
rivers, and died in 1881. At this time Dr. Grant was minister of the
Free Church at Terara, and on the Establishment of the Australian
Free Church both congregations became united, with Terara as the
meeting place. The cabbage-tree building at Numba gave place to
an iron church, which yet stands ; and the Anglican body built the brick
church at Terara which served the congregation for many years before
similar accommodation was provided in Nowra. The Wesleyan con-
gregation had a chapel in Terara for a long period prior to building in
Nowra. The Anglicans also established a good day school at Terara,
in charge of Mr. H. Thistleton, about the year 1854. One of the first
national schools in the country was opened by Mr. W. Rose, one of the
teachers brought from England to introduce the national system of
education. This school was on the site now occupied by the Worrigee
public school building. The first school in Nowra was under the
National School System, and opened in a most unpretentious building


where the Presbyterian Church now stands, the teacher being Mr.
Boyce, who was succeeded by Mr. D. Ogilvy. As increased attendance
demanded fresh accommodation, steps were taken to erect a permanent
building. In those times Government assistance was given in all cases
of the kind conditionally upon the people interested subscribing two-
thirds of the total cost of the building, the Government paying the other
third ; and this condition was observed in the case of the Nowra school.
Prior to the erection of the solid stone Presbyterian Church (the first
permanent edifice of the kind built in the town), all religious services
in Nowra were conducted in the Courthouse ; and for some time after-
wards Dr. Grant placed his church at the disposal of the other ministers.
Some notes on the churches are given on another page.
The district, which is now one of the closest settled in Australia,
soon developed in agricultural activityonce the original roads were formed
by the Berrys, and at an early stage grew not only sufficient for local
requirements, but largely supplied the Sydney market as well. Before
the introduction of steam communication with Sydney, a large fleet
of sailing boats was regularly employed taking produce from the river.
The year 1854 was a record one for the district in an agricultural sense,
as then heavy crops of potatoes and maize were obtained, and fetched
extraordinarily high prices. The scarcity of these products in Sydney
owing to trading vessels being weather-bound, very often put the market
up, and as many as thirty outward-bound vessels were detained at one
time by continuous N.E. winds, to the ultimate benefit, it so happened,
of the producers. Many farmers engaged in wheat growing, but the
rust in time appeared in the crops, and this industry collapsed. For
the same reason a large flour mill, established at Terara, had to close.
Before the introduction of the dairy-factory system for the co-operative
production of butter, Shoalhaven contributed largely to the Sydney
maize market, and for some years Mr. James Aldcorn and partners ran
successfully a number of vessels to Melbourne direct from the river
with cargoes of the cereal product. Shipbuilding was a popular and luc-
rative industry at this time, and some good vessels were launched at
Nowra, by Messrs. Greentree, Dillon, and later on by Hardman Bros, and
Elvard ; and at Coolangatta by Messrs. Hawken. Some of these ran
in charge of Captains Gray, Barron, and Elyard ; but the sailers soon
disappeared after the coming of the steam droghers, successively in
command of Captains Fletcher, Avis, and Buchanan ; and the improve-
ment of the service by the introduction of two steamers built to the
order of the Berry Estate for the river trade. Timber-getting engaged
much attention for a long period. There was a wealth of cedar on the
Cambewarra mountain, and considerable quantities of it were sent to
Sydney, much also being utilised for building and furnishing purposes
locally.
In 1856, on the passing of the first Country Municipal Act, there
were several movements for incorporation, but these met with much
opposition ; and when one municipality was formed litigation was com-
menced by owners who objected to pay taxes, and this broke up the


municipality. Tlie Nowra municipality, as at present constituted, nas
formed under the Act of 1867, but the early operations of the Council
were hampered by the small revenue received, the income for some
years being little over £IOO. Nowra Council was one of the first country
corporate bodies to establish a free public library. £2OO was granted
by the Government for this purpose, provided 100 volumes were donated
bv residents to form the nucleus of a library. 11ns condition ivas ful-
filled, and in 1874 the grant was expended, the purchase of books in-
cluding the Encyclopedia Britannica. The Library was merged into
that of the Nowra School of Arts on the establishment of that institute
in 1885. The council held its meetings in the building known as Tory’s
Hotel, in Kinghorn Street. By the efforts of the aldermen, a Mechanics’
Institute and debating class were formed, and eventually collected funds
and erected a brick building on an allotment at the corner of Kinghorn
and Plunket Streets, which was portion of the police paddock, and
which, years later, reverted to the Crown and was finally taken as a
site for the present police station. Through lack of interest by the pub
lie after the retirement of the old members of the Council, the Mechanics’
Institute collapsed, but it was resuscitated some years afterwards and
amalgamated with the present School of Arts, the Government granting
the institute £4OO in lieu of the old site, which, as before stated, had been
resumed.
The first notable flood in Shoalhaven was in February, 1852, but
it did little damage. The flood in January, 1860, was most disastrous,
causing loss of life and much destruction of property. There was also
loss of life in the 1870 flood, and property in the then thriving town of
Terara suffered considerably. There was soon afterwards an exodus,
many people going to the northern rivers, and with the subsequent steady
growth of Nowra, the original town of Terara gradually became depopu-
lated. Many good buildings, including a store, went by the flood
through the washing away of the river banks. A steamer (the Coolan-
gatta ) was carried out to sea and overturned, the captain (Avis) and
his hands miraculously escaping from the uncontrollable flood-borne
vessel before she reached the bar.
Immediately after the erection of the Nowra Bridge, a demand
set in for town building allotments. Encouraging prices were obtained
for allotments submitted by Mr. John Smith ; and in 1883 a sale of
subdivision lots of large blocks purchased by Messrs. John Maclean and
Robert Finlayson took place, with successful results, the prices running
up to £l3O for lots of 33ft. frontage. The values increased 40 per cent,
within a year. As the population of Nowra increased, the need of a
permanent water supply engaged the attention of the municipal authori-
ties, and in 1895 Mr. John Maclean, who was then Mayor, successfully
moved for the establishment of the present waterworks. The town
of Berry is similarly supplied, and in other respects has advanced as an
important centre with the general progress of the district. The Nowra
Council, at the time of writing, has negotiated for the establishment of
gasworks and the lighting of the streets, this at the instigation of Alder-


. ||pr”
ft
man Peak. This undertaking should add to the importance of Nowra
as one of the model towns of the State.
The Shoalhaven Agricultural Association was established 6th
March, 1874. Prior to this exhibitions were held in connection with
the Berry Estate, on grounds at Gerringong. Mr. James Aldcorn was
the first President of the Shoalhaven Society, Mr. James Monaghan
the first treasurer, and Mr. John McArthur the first secretary. The
formation of the Society was celebrated by the holding of ploughing
matches on the Terara Estate, Ist July, followed by a dinner at night.
The ploughing matches were won by John Watson (first-class), with
John Monaghan second ; John Me Anally (second class), with Arthur
Smith second ; and John Bates (youths’ class), with Alfred Bartlett
■second. The dinner was held at Isaacs’ Royal Victoria Hotel, Mr.
H. G. Morton presided, and amongst the many visitors was Mr. G. H.
Reid, now Prime Minister of Australia. The annual shows of the Society
were held at Terara, on the old Presbyterian Church grounds, until
1884 ; since then they have been held at Nowra, on ground (10 acres)
granted by the Crown. The first Government grant of money (£104)
was received on 24th August, 1874, and the first show was held 11th
February, 1875. The Berry Agricultural Association was established
in 1883, with Mr. L. Mclntyre as first president, and Mr. A. J. Colley
us secretary ; and the first show was held February 7th and Bth, 1884.
There are few better grounds than those of Berry, and the success of
this Society is due to
a large extent to the
generous assistance
given first by Mr. David
Berry, and afterwards
by the present patron,
Dr. Hay. The Kan-

tural Society, founded
after that of Berry, is

looked on the many beauty spots of this region, by water and by land.
The South Coast Tourist Union is doing much to illustrate the places
of charming interest. The climate of Nowra is the mildest, summer
and winter, in the State ; the Government Meteorologist in a work

“ LYNBURN,” BOMADERRY, RESIDENCE OF MRS. MORTON, SEN.
In 1889 there was a general movement for the establishment of
butter factories or creameries, as a result of which dairy companies
were formed in various centres, amongst them being those of Worrigee,
Barrengarry, Kangaroo River, Jindiandy, Tomerong, Cambewarra and
Meroo, Cambewarra West, Comerong, Berry, Back Forest, Jasper’s
Brush, Bengelala, Belong, and, later on, Meroo Meadow and Nowra
Hill Creamery. A number of these have since wound up, in a measure
owing to the introduction of the private separator, but local production
has gone on increasing, and the large output of the Berry Central Butter
Factory (established by Dr. Hay), and also of the Nowra Co-operative
factory, which, started a few years ago, has attracted universal atten-
tion, and been of considerable benefit to the producers.


In 1873 the police district had 16,03(5 horned cattle, 2925 horses,,
6934 pigs, and 436 sheep. 7114 acres were under corn, the yield being
215,911 bushels, and 10 acres under wheat (102 bushels). [Wheat
growing failed about this time] ; 478 acres under potatoes, the yield of
which was 1924 tons. There were 224 freeholders, 38 freeholders and
leaseholders, and 362 leaseholders, the freeholds representing 66,340
acres, and leaseholds 31,035 acres. In 1890, cattle totalled 33,071
horses 4789, pigs 9736, and sheep 2486. The area under permanent
artificial grasses that year was 53,890 acres ; total area under cultiva-
tion, 63,941 acres. Official returns since that time, showing a large
increase in stock, do not clearly indicate local statistics, the Shoalhaven
figures being included with Kiama, which sheep district had in 1902
55,784 horned cattle, 7334 horses, 7547 sheep.
The Yalwal goldfield, on Dangera Creek, running between very
steep hills, has been of good support to Nowra, but of late years there
has been a conspicuous falling off in the returns. In the early days a
water-wheel battery was worked on one of the mines, which as the
workings developed was superseded by costly batteries, as represented
by the Homeward Bound, Pioneer, Eclipse, and other companies. A
curious feature of the field is the apparent regularity of the strata at
certain points, and the non-existence of defined reefs for any distance.
The Homeward Bound was sold in 1890 by the original holders, Messrs.
Thorburn, Faulks and Mison, to Victorian capitalists, including Messrs.
Joseph Clark and Gayer, for £20,000. Up to that time over £30,000
worth of gold was won from it, but costly litigation afterwards hampered
operations. The Pioneer mine was sold about the same time by Messrs.
Thorburn, Jas. Kennedy, and Jas. Monaghan to a Victorian miner for
£15,000. A field was opened at Grassy Gully several years ago and some
good gold was obtained from it, but there was nothing to warrant
extensive investments, and now only a few men are working there.

THE BACCHUS MARSH Co’s. MILK CONDENSERY, BOMADERRY.
This factory, erected by Dr. Hay, and originally managed by Mr. J. W. Fell, was acquired a few years ago by the
Bacchus Marsh Co. (Vic.), and is now managed by Mr. J. Tancoe. For its purposes the company draws largely upon the
milk supply of the district, and pays suppliers a rate higher than that given for milk at the creameries. The output has
never yet exceeded the demand.

THE MEMBER FOR ALLOWRIE.
Mr. Mark F. Morton, recently elected Parliamentary representative
of the new electorate of Allowrie (embracing Shoalhaven, Kiama, and
part of the Illawarra District), was born at Numba, and is 37 years of
age. After leaving school he spent several years in the office of Harrison,
Jones and Devlin, Sydney, where he obtained a first-class commercial
training, and in 1888 joined the well-known auctioneering firm of Stewart
and Morton. For many years he has identified himself closely with
matters of public i?nportance in Shoalhaven. Seven years ago he was
elected to represent the North Ward of the Nowra municipality, and in
1901 was elected Mayor of Nowra, a position he filled with credit to
himself, and with great advantage to the municipality. While he oc-
cupied the Mayoral chair, he was returned to Parliament by a large
majority of electors of his native district, and this confidence is now
shared by the newly delimitated constituency of Allowrie, which elected
him by a majority of 1200. Mr. Morton in this election polled more
votes than any otlur candidate in New South Wales. He is a bachelor,
resides at Bomaderry with his mother, and is extremely popular.


MR. CHARLES I. WATSON.
Charles Isaac Watson, the founder of the Shoalhaven and Braidwood
Press, was born at Windsor, Hawkesbury River, 4th July, 1829, and
died at Terara, February 24th, 1886. At the time of his death he was
the oldest provincial journalist in N.S.W. He established The Aus-
tralian (Windsor), the Braidwood Dispatch, and afterwards the Braid
wood News, which was the
first daily newspaper pub
lished outside Sydney. Other
of his journalistic ventures
included the Shoalhaven Neivs
(of which his eldest son is now
editor), the Kiama Reporter 7
the Araluen Star, the Ulla-
dulla Free Press, etc. He
was for some time also identi-
fied with a section of the
metropolitan press. He saw
much of the life on famous
Bendigo and other goldfields
of Australia, and was known
beyond the limits of che
colonies as one of the most
fearless and vigorous writers
of his time, being—as the
Sydney Bulletin, in writing of
him, put it —top scorer in
Australian libel actions. As a journalist he had many enemies, but in
private life many friends. In 1865 he gave great assistance in the rais-
ing of volunteer corps. Coming to Shoalhaven in 1867, he established
and opened the first local lodge of Oddfellows, and the first Savings
Bank for the people, and was the first enrolled member of the Agricul-
tural Society. He strongly advocated, and was largely instrumental
in obtaining, the incorporation of several municipal districts, and liber-
ally contributed to public libraries, sporting institutions, and philan-
thropic objects. His death was in a great measure due to an injury he
sustained on the Shoalhaven Showground, when in endeavouring to
save a young lady from being run over by a horse which had bolted
with a rail of a fence swinging by its halter, he was knocked down and
struck by the rail. A widow and eight children survived him.

PIONEER JOURNALIST.


Mr. J. GREEN.
Mr. Jeremiah Green was amongst the earliest business men of Shoal-
haven. He purchased in 1863, a branch store established in Nowra by
Mr. John McArthur, and conducted the business successfully through
the transitional changes of
that period. Mr. Green
retired from business some
years ago, but he still re-
sides in Nowra. He was
the first postmaster of the
town. For a long time the
Sydney mails came twice a
week on horseback from
Wollongong, but on the
extension of the southern
line of railway to Moss Yale,
and the co-incident opening
of the trans-mountain road
from the latter place, Now-
ra was given a daily mail,
which was run via Wollon-
gong and Moss Vale alter-
nately. The mails between
Nowra and Moss \'ale were
carried by coach, Mr.
Thomson (Kiama) being
the first contractor for
their conveyance. Mr.
Green rendered conspicu-
ously good service to local
interests, in the early days
of the town. He was one
of the first aldermen elected to the Nowra Municipal Council, thirty-two
years ago, and he several times filled the position of Mayor. Ihe pub-
lisher is indebted to him for a statement of certain of the facts contained
in this book.

■
Mr. John McArthur.
John McArthur, a pioneer in the commercial life of the district, did
much for the primary producers in the early days, and subsequently
rendered service to establish institutions that will not soon be forgotten.
He was a conspicuous figure in the district, and was well known and
much esteemed in other
districts also for a life-
time. The work he
did for the common
good up to a time in
life when most m3H
would seek, and reas-
onably claim, retire
ment, will stand as a
memorial to him
through generations
yet to come. Shoal-
haven never had a
more public spirited
man, nor better citizen;
it can never expect to
have one of more un-
tiring energy or indom-
itable perseverance ;
and it is not likely to
have one to more close
ly follow Kingsley’s ad •
vice “ Do noble things,
not dream them all
day long.” John
McArthur contributed
quite as much to the
progress of Shoalhaven
as any of the pioneers
of other parts of the country did to the advancement of their districts.
He did not engage in the industries of primary production, but he as-
sisted those who did to a degree beyond the calculations of anyone who
knew him here. In the times of the big floods, in the sixties and seven-
ties, he was indeed a true friend to many who were called upon to tide
over troublous periods, and, generally speaking, his name was promi-
nently associated with all philanthropic undertakings in which actions
spoke louder than words. He was born at Paisley, Scotland, in 1829
and came to N.S.W. in 1854, in which year he established a storekeeping
business which he continued many years with much success. He
spent small fortunes in local mining, and in shipbuilding, and in the
shipping trade, and for some time had a steamer of his own running
between Sydney and the river in connection with his store business.


He' was one of the founders of the Shoalhaven Agricultural Society,
and during the hardest years of that Society’s existence he acted as
honorary secretary, and devoted much of his time to its affairs. He
had a remarkable capacity for work, and was often employed at his
own or the public business long before other people had started their
day’s work, and as frequently long after they had retired from it. In
1886 he visited England, and on leaving Nowra was presented with an
address and purse of sovereigns. On his return, he built new premises
(now occupied by Woodhill and Co.), having in the meantime ceased
other enterprises which had proved too much for his continued per-
sonal supervision. Several years later financial troubles overtook him,
and he gave up the business, though on assignment it was found the
estate paid 20/- in the £ and a few shillings over. In truth, the
business had assumed proportions beyond his grip, after forty years
active occupation. His comfortable home at Terara was secured to
his widow by public subscription, as a free gift, in consideration of
Mr. McArthur’s long residence in the district, and his many good works,
and in sympathy with him in his financial misfortunes. He died May
28th, 1904, leaving a widow, three sons, and two daughters. He was
a foremost worker in the temperance cause, and a much valued
member of the Presbyterian Church, of which he was for years an elder,
and for a long period Session Clerk. He was a man of strong opinions,
with a courage to express them that is not commonly observable
among men nowadays ; yet by his well-ordered, conscientious, and con-
sistent life he enjoyed the esteem and respect of all classes to the end,
both in prosperity and adversity.

MUNICIPAL.
NOWRA.
I he Municipal District of Nowra was incorporated in 1871, the area
being 15,552 acres. Mr. James Waddington was the first returning-
officer, and the first council consisted of Henry Moss (Mayor), Bernard
Brown, John McArthur, David Hyam, James Maguire, and Jeremiah
Green. The general rates for the first year amounted to £125. For
the present year (1904) they total £712. The total annual rental of
buildings and cultivated lands is now £14,653, and the capital value of
unimproved lands is £13,188. In 1895 the water-works, constructed
by the Government under the Country Towns Water and Sewerage Act.
at a total capital cost of £12,592, were completed and handed over to
the Council. Shortly after the works were completed and the town
reticulated, Dr. Hay applied for the water for his Belong farms, and water
is now supplied to these properties fronting a line of four miles. As this
proved a considerable drain on the town supply during the drought
the Council, through the Government, locked another creek at the source
of the supply, about half a mile from the first dam, which resulted in


v ; - ......
the doubling of the supply, and placing it in an undoubted position.
The supply is taken from creeks at the foot of Cambewarra mountain,
and analysts in Sydney have declared there is only one other supply in
the world purer than it. The Council has arranged a loan for the con-
struction of gasworks, under the supervision of Mr. J. C. Alexander,
Engineer, Sydney. . Successive mayors of the Nowra Council since
incorporation have been Messrs. H. Moss (seven years), B. Brown,
J. Green (seven years), E. Seccombe (four years), R. Patterson, John
Maclean (two years), C, Graham (four years), D. Hyam (two years),
W. P. Blackmore, Z. G. Bice, Mark F. Morton, H. K. King, W. West-
brook.
Mr. William West-
brook, Mayor of Nowra,
has served as an alderman
for nine years, and has been
an earnest, careful worker,
and one of the most con-
scientious men in local
municipal life. He was the
founder of the Shoalhaven
Choral Society, and con-
ductor of it for several
years, and has been a hard
worker for the Nowra
School of Arts, which he
helped to establish nearly
twenty years ago. He is
choirmaster of the Nowra
Methodist Church, and
superintendent of the
Sunday School. The
Mayor is a native of Syd-
ney, where his father
was a veterinary surgeon
and farrier in the early
sixties. Mayor Westbrook
admits having been born
in 1856.
The Numba Municipality, one of the first established in N.S.W.,
was incorporated in 1852. Of the early years of its existence there is
little information available, but it is known that with the extension of
the Berry Estate work, this first incorporated district on the Shoalhaven
did great service for the settlement in forming roads, in which work
assistance was given by the Berry family. Among those who gave
their services in an aldermanic capacity, were H. G. Morton, D. Waddell,
J. Housten, H. Weigand, John Smith, and C. Murray (all long since
passed away), and J. Ryan, Jas. Davis, and others still in the flesh. A
Free Public Library established in connection with the Council was a

great boon to the people in those days. Mr. John Bindon acted as lib-
rarian and Council Clerk for many years.
The Central Shoalhaven Municipality, comprising the district be-
tween Numba and Nowra, was incorporated several years after that
of Nowra, with Mr. W. Lovegrove as first mayor, and thus was included
the incorporation in three sections of a tract of country which might
have with more advantage to the people been originally constituted
one municipality, and, which in fact, was requisitioned for by the
earliest movers for local self-government, and which must inevitably
end so.
The Numba and Central Shoalhaven municipalities were in the
eighties amalgamated under the title of “ South Shoalhaven,” which
continues, with Mr. R. Teeming as Council Clerk. The council meets
at Terara, and on the amalgamation being effected the valuable volumes
found a resting place on the shelves of the Pyree School of Arts, by vote
of the ratepayers. The annual rental and capital values produce rates
totalling £505. Among the early aldermen were Messrs. J. Lamond,
D. Hyam, W. Lovegrove, D. and A. McLean, J. P. Brereton, M. Walker,
T. F. Herne, John Lamond and J. J. Emery.
The Berry Municipality was inaugurated under the title of “ Brough-
ton Creek and Bomaderry,” and Mr. James Wilson, one of the earliest
residents, was its first
mayor. Mr. Wilson did
conspicuous service as a
councillor for nearly a
quarter of a century, and
had with him as colleagues
from time to time such
men as J. Tindall, J. Mc-
Kenzie, W. Stewart, John
Gray, Lewis Mclntyre,
John Boxsell, and others,
who did much in their
time to advance the best
interests of the district.
Mr. Henry Taylor was
council clerk for a long
period—Mr. J. C. Timms
now fills the office. The
rates are £698, derived
from a rental value of
£14,480, and a capital value
of £18,900.

is a young man, of progressive ideas, a very ready speaker, a good
debater, and a prominent worker in the temperance cause.
Mr. Alex. McLean, the Mayor of South Shoalhaven, is a native
of Argyleshire, Scotland, and came to N.S.W. at an early age. He and
his brother Donald, who died in 1899, settled at Crookhaven, and pros-
pered as farmers. Mr. Alex. McLean continues his early interest in
municipal matters, and is rarely absent from his post, despite his ad-
vancing years.

MR. Z. G. BICE.
Mr. Zaccheus Glanville Bice is one of the oldest, if not the oldest,
of the Shoalhaven residents. He was born in Cornwall, England,
18th April, 1829, and came to N.S.W. with his mother in 1837, and im-
mediately joined relatives in Shoalhaven. Remaining with them a
short time, he returned to Sydney, to school, chiefly at the Normal
Institution, in Elizabeth
Street. Four years
afterwards he made his
way back to Shoalhaven,
where he has .resided
ever since. He married^
early in life, theyoungest
daughter of William
Munro, of the Richmond
River, and in 1851 he
purchased from the
Crown some land at
Cambewarra, being the
first settler immediately
on that, the north side,
of the Shoalhaven River.
There he lived two years
without neighbors, roads,
ferries, or conveniences
of any kind ; then others
began to settle in the
locality, and soon the
north side of the river
was peopled. Mr. Bice
has taken an active and
intelligent interest in
all matters pertaining to
the welfare and advance-
ment of the district, and has occupied many positions of trust and offices
of important responsibility. He was appointed a Justice of the Peace
in 1867, a Commissioner for Affidavits in 1873, Returning-Officer for
Parliamentary elections in 1877, a member of the local land Board, and
a guardian of minors in 1885, and district coroner in 1886. In this
last-mentioned year he leased his property at Cambewarra, and took
up his residence in Nowra. He was twice elected an alderman of the
Nowra Municipal Council, and once as Mayor, when ill-health compelled
to retire from public life. In his younger days he was a great athlete,
excelling in cricket and rowing ; and he has been a prominent Free-
mason for many years, having been Past Grand Senior on the books of
the Lodge when Lord Carrington was installed Grand Master in Sydnev
Mr. Bice has a family of fourteen, most of them married.

SCHOOLS OF ARTS.
The Nowra School of Arts was established in 1885, and held its meetings
in Green’s Hall, Junction-street, until 1892, when the present com-
modious and imposing building in Berry-street, costing £2500, was
erected. The foundation stone was laid by the Hon. J. H. Young.
It has a hall with seating accommodation for 500 persons ; a well-
appointed stage, with retiring rooms ; and a library containing over
2000 volumes ; and is lighted with acetylene gas. An upstairs room
is occupied as council clerk’s office. The Berry School of Arts was es-
tablished some years later, and has one of the best country libraries in
the State. The income of this institute the first year was £378. There
is also a School of Arts at Kangaroo Valley, with an interesting geological
collection and museum. Pyree and Jasper’s Brush have similar in-
stitutions.
o
In commercial life, the name of Woodhill & Co. represents a suc-
cessful business connection with the Hawkesbury, simultaneously with
the conduct of the pioneer storekeeping business in Shoalhaven, to
which the firm succeeded ten years ago.

by the Edgmoor Iron Co., Delaware, U.S.A., and one of the spans was exhibited
at the International Exhibition, Sydney, in 1879. The bridge covers 1050 lineal
feet of water space, is 21 in width, and cost £42,500.

Rev. WILLIAM GRANT, D.D.
William Grant was born in Nairn, Scotland, on March Idth, 1806.
His parents were noted for their piety and noble character, and were
distinguished for generosity and kindness to the poor and needy, quali-
ties which their son inherited to the full. He early showed signs of
exceptional ability, and after a successful college career, entered the
ministry of the Presbyterian Church. His ability, earnestness, and
fervid eloquence soon made their mark, and drew, and retained, crowded
•congregations of men wherever he went. In response to an urgent
appeal from the young Church in Australia for “ first-class men ” to
come out as pioneers, he resigned his charge in the city of Perth, Scot-
land, and in the prime of life and the height of popularity and usefulness,
sailed for N.S.W. Arriving in the early fifties, he travelled for one year
throughout the colony, evangelising "and organising ; then accepted a
call to Shoalhaven, his choice of this’place being largely decided by the
fact that there was there a number of Highland families, for whom he
-every Sabbath conducted a full service in Gaelic, immediately\>n the
•conclusion of the English service, preaching, and himself conducting


the singing in the Gaelic language. This he continued to do till all who
could not understand English well, had died, or removed from the dis-
trict. As the country was opened up, his sphere of labor was extended,
taking in Gerringong, Broughton Creek (now Berry), Kangaroo Valley,.
Robertson. Moss Vale, Nattai (now Mittagong), Joadja Creek, Burner,
and even to Milton and Braidwood. Every moonlight night, during
many years, save during the three midsummer months, he held service
somewhere, near or far, in farm houses where there was no school or
church building. In the year 1879 he received the honorary degree of
D.D. from Queen’s University, Canada, and in 1886 his ministerial
jubilee was celebrated by a large and enthusiastic gathering at Nowra
when he was presented with an illuminated address, a silver tea and
coffee service, and a set of silver-mounted double harness. This, with
characteristic modesty, he always spoke regretfully of as “ far too much
for him.” He was of a particularly unassuming and retiring disposition,
and absolutely unselfish in his life. Though an excellent platform
speaker, and able writer, Dr. Grant was above all a preacher. The
preaching of the Gospel of Christ was his life work, and his life-pleasure :
and his cultured style, aided by a clear voice and natural manner, made
it a pleasure and a privilege to listen to his ably-reasoned sermons.
He might well be called the “ father of his people,” having ministered
here to three generations. He entered into all their joys and sorrows,
and indeed many of other denominations, both Protestant and Catholic.,
brought their difficulties and troubles to him for counsel and consolation.
Till over eighty years of age he continued “ in labours abundant,”'
riding long distances, preaching, visiting, but at the age of eighty-five
he retired from the active ministry, and lived quietly at his home in
gradually failing health, till 9th August, 1897, when he “ fell asleep ”
at the age of 91. The influence and example of such a man, with his-
consistency to his high standard of Christian living, must have been a
power for good in those early days when society was still in a formative
state. “ The memory of the just is blessed.”
o
NOWRA FIRE BRIGADE.
The Nowra Volunteer Fire Brigade was established in 1895, imme-
diately upon the completion of the town water supply, by Mr. T. Mar-
riott, who was elected captain, and continued in that position until 1903.
when he retired in favor of Mr. Joseph Sidney. The brigade has been
the means on more than one occasion of saving the town from serious-
conflagrations, and has always been in an efficient state. The oldest
members of the brigade, besides ex-captain Marriott, are Messrs. Harrv
Smith, Joseph Sidney (now captain), Samuel Gyde, Geo.Vost, J. J.Penny
Charles Bennett, H. Knight, F. Aldous, S. Elliott, Norman Sidney, and
James Gibson. The last named member has occupied the office of

secretary and treasurer to the brigade for many years, and Dr. H. K.
King has for a long period occupied the position of honorary surgeon.
The brigade has a well-appointed station, erected on its own ground in
a central position in the town, and is equipped with most up-to date
appliances of the kind.
o
MASONIC.
Lodge “ Abercorn,” No. 60 (Nowra), was instituted on 30th May,
1878, the opening ceremony being performed by the late Bro. J. S. Ear-
ned, Grand Master of the New South Wales Constitution. The first
Master of the Lodge was the late Bro. H. G. Morton, who had as his
Wardens, Bro. Z. G. Bice and the late Bro. J. Wilson, of Berry. After
the amalgamation of the various Constitutions holding under the Grand
Lodges of England, Scotland, Ireland and New South Wales, the Lodge
“ Abercorn ” was re-constituted under the United Grand Lodge of
N.S. Wales, and was numbered 60 on the roll —June 24th, 1888. Since
its inception the Lodge meetings were held at Moss’s Hotel, Greenhills,
but in 1890, a site having been given by Bro. Jas. Graham, a commodious
hall, with dwelling house on the basement, was erected, and the Lodge
meetings are held there on the Tuesday nearest the full moon in each
month, at 7.30 p.m.
The office bearers at present are V. Worshipful Bro. Dr. H. K. King.

The opening of Lodge “ Broughton,” at Berry, soon followed that
of Nowra, and members of the Craft in both places have since worked
well together.
THE LATE Mr. H. G. MORTON.
Mr. H. G. Morton, who died at Nnmba, Shoalhaven, on August 26th,
1895, was widely known in this colony. He was born in Edinburgh,- in
October, 1828,’ ’was educated in the High School in that city, and after-
wards trained as a sur-
veyor and railway en-
gineer. He was engaged
on railway surveys
throughout England and
Scotland for several
years prior to his leav-
ing for Australia. He
arrived in Melbourne
in 1852, and soon after-
wards found his way
to Sydney, bringing a
letter of introduction to
Sir Stuart Alexander
Donaldson, the then
Prime Minister, by
whom he was subse-
quently engaged in
connection with the old
General Screw (steamer)
Company. After being
in that company for a
short time, the late Mr;
Morton was engaged by
Mr. Alexander Berry
to go to Shoalhaven to
survey and lay out
farms on the now cele-
brated Shoalhaven Estate, and which some years a.go passed into


the possession of Dr. Hay in terms of the will of Mr. David Derry. Mr,
Morton afterwards became land steward, as well as surveyor for the
estate, and occupied the post without a break up to 1890, when
he retired. In 1892, he took a trip to the old country, and returned
the following year. Both upon his departure and return he was testi-
monialised by the Shoalhaven people, amongst and with whom he had
worked in various movements for the public good for upwards of forty
years. Mr. Morton, in years gone by, rendered good service in municipal
work, and in local Agricultural Societies. He was the first Mayor of
Numba, and one of the founders of the Shoalhaven Agricultural and
Horticultural Association. His appointment as a magistrate dates
many years back, as does also his first connection with the masonic
institution ; and the establishment of public libraries and working
men’s clubs received particular attention from him in the earlier days.
He was in short a man of a good many parts, well read, of a most genial
nature, with an inexhaustible fund of natural humour. The universal
respect in which he was held was fully evinced by the very large atten-
dance at the funeral in Nowra, the cortege being the largest seen in the
district for many years.
The late Mr. Morton had a family of eight—all sons —the eldest
being Mr. Philip H. Morton, who was for ten years member for Shoal-
haven, and is now Chairman of Directors of the Australian Joint Stock
Bank. Mr. Oswald G. Morton, A.M.1.C.E., is resident Roads Engineer
in the N.S.W. State service ; Mr. Mark F. Morton, is M.L. A. for Allowrie ;
Mr. H. D. Morton is agent of the Berry Estate in Shoalhaven. Of the
four others, Messrs. A. J. and Fred occupy positions in Sydney, and
Messrs. Arthur and Septimus reside in Shoalhaven.
o
THE HAWKESBURY AND THE SHOALHAVEN.
Note the alliance of these two districts historically in the following-
particulars : —Burner was granted to Mary Reiby 80 years ago. She
went to Governor Macquarie for a further grant, and the Governor
suggested 800 acres in Woolloomooloo Bay. “ That wouldn’t feed a
bandicoot,” said she. “ Well, then,” said His Excellency, “ North
Shore, as much as you like.” The applicant rejected that also, saying
the country was “ all trees and rocks,” but ultimately she was offered
and accepted 200 acres on the Hawkesbury, where she for a long time
resided.
Seventy-five years ago the founder of the Shoalhaven Press was
born at Windsor, and had much to do with the early newspaper work
of the Hawkesbury prior to pioneering the Shoalhaven, in which district
his eldest son is now the senior pressman.
Ex-champion oarsman, James Stanbury, was born on the Hawkes-
bury. His first boat race, wh'ch led him to fame in aquatics, was rowed
in a regatta on the Shoalhaven, at Nowra.


y :\ A
FIRST PARLIAMENTARY REPRESENTATIVE
JAMES THOMSON.
Mr. James Thomson, who died at Barrier, Shoalhaven, in 1899, was the
first Parliamentary representative of the district, having been returned
in the first election, in 1856, on the establishment of responsible Govern-
ment. He was the eldest son of Thomas Thomson, a lieutenant in the
Royal Marine Light Infantry, and was born August 26th, 1824, at Laun-
ceston, Tasmania. He was educated in Sydney, at the Australian
College and the Sydney College, and for a time after leaving school was
deposition clerk to his uncle, Captain Innes, then Police Magistrate for
the city of Sydney. Mr. Thomson, afterwards entered the service of
the Bank of Australasia, in Launceston, Tasmania, and in 1847 he came
to Burner, which was a grant to Mary Reibey in 1824, and was settled
in the thirties, with Mr. Alexander Mackay as manager. Mr. Thomson
was a grandson of Mrs. Reibey, and when he came finally from Tasmania,
the grantee gave Burner and also Illaroo to him and John Atkinson,
another grandson, and some time afterwards Mr. Thomson bought out


his cousin’s interest in the place, and continued to live at Burner up to
his death. Mr. Thomson was appointed a Justice of the Peace in the
early days of the settlement, and for a long time he and Dr. Mackenzie
were the only magistrates in the district. The Court was then held at
Coolangatta. He sat only one session in Parliament, and that session
cost him £BOO. As he considered the occupancy of the position involved
too much expense, he did not seek re-election. The only communication
with Sydney in those days was by sailing vessels, and on one occasion
the subject of our sketch was becalmed off Kiama for three weeks. Mr.
Thomson had some exciting experiences of the big Shoalhaven floods,
of which the flood of 1860 was the most disastrous. Staying with him
at that period were Mr. Andre De Mestre and Mr. Charles Moore (after-
wards Dr. Moore, curator of Sydney Botanic Gardens). Although no
rain had fallen up to 9 p.m. on the 9th February, yet at daylight on the
10th the river was a banker. Mr. Thomson and his friends had to bolt
for it, and that night camped in a fowl-house belonging to a neighbour.
At Burner the river rose so rapidly that very little of the people’s belong
ings could be removed. Old residents say the river waters rose 15 feet
in as many minutes, at one time.
In 1870 there was another large flood, which cut the banks from
under the old home at Burner, and Mr. Thomson had to live in his barn
until he built another house. The ’7O flood, although as high as that
of ’6O, was not so destructive to the farmers, for before 1860 the principal
crop was wheat. Much was lost in the ’6O flood, and all the wheat
crops the following year were lost through rust. The ravages of the
rust continuing, the farmers, several years afterwards, abandoned wheat-
growing. In April, 1860, Mr. Thomson married Mary Mackenzie,
daughter of Dr. Kenneth Mackenzie, of Bundanon, afterwards of Dun-
donnell, Ross-shire, N.B. On his death (7th June, 1899), his wife and
nine children —five sons and four daughters—survived him. One of
the sons (Mr. Thomas M.) served with distinction in the South African
war.

ECCLESIASTICAL.
CHURCH OF ENGLAND.
The handsomest church building in the South Coast district is generally
admitted to be All Saints’, Nowra. The foundation stone was laid on
22nd August, 1899, by Earl Beaucham.p, then governor of N.S.W., and
when the Rev. H. M. Trickett was rector. The building, which seats
280 persons, cost £1079, and was opened in 1900 with a debt of only
£250 remaining on it. The original building, also of brick, and which
stands alongside the new, is used as a school-hall, and for entertainments.
The ministrations of the Rev. W. Newby-Fraser, who was formerly an
Indian missionary, have been conspicuously successful. For many
years successive ministers had their residence in Terara, but soon after
the first church was opened in Nowra, a rectory was also erected. The
foundation stone of this was laid December 12th, 1877, by Mrs. Hargrave,
wife of the then incumbent. At Berry there is a substantial church and
rectory, both of brick ; and the Rector (Rev. G. H. Muzy), who is a
bachelor, is greatly assisted in his ministrations by his sister.

ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH.
Services were held regularly for many years in a wooden building at
the corner of Shoalhaven and North Streets, Nowra, the priest in charge
being the Rev. Fr. M.
D’Arcy. In 1887 the
present stone building, on
the opposite corner, was
erected, and was opened
by Archbishop Vaughan
(Sepetmber 29). The
church was blessed at 11
a.m., after which Ponti-
fical High Mass was cele-
brated by Fr. Hayes, of
Kiama, The collections
at this service totalled £250.
The celebrations were as-
sisted by Deans McCarthy
(Sydney) and Flanagan
(Wollongong), Frs. O’Reilly
(Dapto), Hayes (Kiama),
and D’Arcy (Shoalhaven’.
Archbishop Vaughan was
escorted to Nowra from
Greenwell Point (where he
landed from the Sydney
steamer) by a very large
cavalcade of his people in
vehicles and on horseback-,-
and the gathering at the
church included many visi-
tors from distant parts.
The two-storey Presbytery,
on the block of church land,
was built also in 1887, the
foundation stone being laid
October Bth, by Dr. Carroll, Vicar-General, Sydney. Contributions
totalling £lO7 10s., were laid upon the stone. Services are held regu-
larly at Berry and Kangaroo Valley, as well as Nowra, Fr. P. A. Holland
being assisted by Fr. J. Malone.

PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH AND MANSE.
The Rev. Wm. (afterwards Dr.) Grant was inducted to the charge of the
Free Church in Shoalhaven, at Terara in 1855. There was also a Pres-
byterian congregation at Numba, representing the Established Church
of Scotland. When these two sections united the Presbyterians of
Shoalhaven became one Church under the pastorate of Dr. Grant, who
ministered in the district for over 40 years. In 1873 the foundation
stone of the present substantial church in Nowra was laid by Mrs. Grant.
The Rev. J. K. Bruce succeeded Dr. Grant, and labored for seven years.
During his pastorate the Manse was built, the Rev. Dr. Steel, of Sydney,
laying the foundation stone. In 1898, the present minister, the Rev.
Robert Inglis, M.A., came to the district, and since he took the charge
the new school-hall has been built, and various improvements to the
Church property have been carried out. The Session consists of Messrs.
T. Robson, D. McTavish, Jas. Watt, John Gibson, R. McDonald, and
A. R. Buckland. The deacons are Messrs. Jas. Morison, A. Hunt, W.
Brown, C. R. Woodhill (Treasurer), W. Bryce, and S. Monaghan (Secre-
tary). A choir practice, Ladies’ Working Society, Young People’s
Mission Band, Public School Bible Class, beside weekly Prayer meetings,
are carried on, and in addition, social work of an important character
is conducted on undenominational lines. The Gymnasium and Literary
Institute have meetings weekly. Mr. E. J. Bignold is the secretary,
and the subscription for both is 1/- per month. The Band of Hope

work of which Mr. Inglis is assisted by Mr. F. Schloeffel as catechist.
Nowra has services twice every Sunday ; Tomerong and Cambewarra,

conductorship of Mr. C. Harper, assisted by Miss B. Grant. Ihe com-
munion is dispensed half-yearly, and there are 190 names on the roll of
members. The minister at Berry is the Rev. D. M‘Lennan, who has a
fine church and manse, erected on an elevated site given by the late
David Berry.
METHODIST CHURCH.
The Methodist Church (opened Ist January, 1878), school-hall, and
parsonage occupy one of the finest sites in Nowra, and the whole property
is a credit to the aggressive people by whose efforts it is maintained,
and is an ornament to the town. The congregation is a large one. On fine


Sabbath mornings there is scarcely a vacant seat, and it is a cheering
sight to witness the yardful of horses, buggies and traps of various
descriptions that have conveyed the worshippers from all parts of the
district. The problem of getting men to church does not seem to be an
urgent one so far as Shoalhaven Methodism is concerned. The minister
of the Circuit, the Rev. Harold Wheen, belongs to a family of preachers.
Of eight brothers, six have been preachers, and three are now serving
the Church in the ranks of the Australian Ministry. The minister is
aided by a staff of able and devoted local preachers. The Circuit
Stewards are Messrs. T. Rendall, J.P., and W. Corfield. The Mayor of
Nowra (Mr. W. Westbrook) is at the head of a growing and prosperous
Sunday School. The trustees of the Church property are Messrs. T.
Binks, sen., J. Hanigan, W. Jamieson, W. Westbrook, G. S. Roberts,
Jas. Shepherd, jun., R. Shepherd, W. Corfield, W. J. Wotton, and John

UNION CHURCHES.
Of the Union Churches in the district which have proved of vast assist-
ance to the spiritual work in outlying parts, two of the most important
from a material point of view are those erected under the will of the
great landlord, David Berry, —one at Meroo, close by the Nowra-Berry
road, and the other at Greenwell Point, on an eminence overlooking the
diverging waters of the Crookhaven. The two buildings are of brick,
and were built by Dr. Hay soon after the demise of Mr. Berry, of whose
generous assistance towards religious work they stand as high memorial.
o
Hume’s Island, Crookhaven River, was named after Hamilton
Hume, who came to Shoalhaven with Alex. Berry, 83 years ago, and
afterwards gained fame as an explorer.


THE SALVATION ARMY.
The Nowra corps of the Salvation Army has a commodious barracks in
a central part of the town, and the work of the army has been carried
on in the district for nineteen years with good encouragement and prac-
tical assistance from the people. Mr. John Faulks, a well-known farmer,
paid the total cost of acquiring the land and erecting the building, and
this liberal donor has helped the Army otherwise to a considerable
extent.
o
HENRY MOSS.
(OBIT. SEPTEMBER 18tH, 1887.)
Amongst the earliest and most successful workers for the progress of
Shoalhaven was Mr. Henry Moss. No man ever worked more influen-
tially or devoted his time and abilities more ungrudgingly in the interests
of the people of Nowra.
In municipal matters he
gave invaluable aid, and,
during a time when there
was much opposition to in-
corporation, he, with
several others,- succeeded
in having established a
municipal district which
had for its boundaries the
boundaries of the police
district, though these ef-
forts were afterwards nulli-
fied by an action at law.
The district was afterwards
cut up into the several
municipalities existing to-
day. Mr. Moss, after the
failure of the “ whole
Shoalhaven ” municipal
scheme, set to work to
found a public town-
ship on the heights by
the Shoalhaven River
and Nowra Creek. This
entailed a
hard struggle. A village re-
serve only then existed, and as far back as 1856 a few allotments had been
sold, but these remained unused, whilst there was, two miles down the
river, the then prosperous town of Terara, —the one business centre of


Shoalhaven, fed by many roads from the east and south, and by half-a-
dozen ferries from the northern side of the district. It was a hard fight to
build up the town of Nowra as against the interests of Terara ; but after
some years of incessant labour, Mr, Moss, aided by several other leading
spirits, including his father-in-law, firmly established No wra as the place
for Petty Sessions, Crown Lands Office and the transaction of Government
business generally. The incorporation of the “ Nowra ” municipality
soon followed, and to the untiring efforts and forethought of Mr. Moss
is mainly due the existence to-day of the parks and recreation grounds
which were wisely set apart for the people, and which will be the more
valued as time goes on. Mr. Moss had an ardent love of classic literature
and history, and was a man of good scientific knowledge. He was for
years a contributor to the Mines Department on the Geology and Miner-
alogy of this district, of which he made a geological survey in 1860.
About that time, the Rev. W. B. Clark, F.R.G.S., whose work “ The
Southern Goldfields,” is well known, wrote to the Governor, acknow-
ledging the services Mr. Moss had rendered him in the making of a geo-
logical survey of the south-east coast of the colony. Mr. Moss was a
conspicuous worker for relief of the distress caused by the great floods
of 1860 and 1870, and he moved Sir John Robertson to send grain to
the farmers to re-sow their fields. In political campaigns he exerted
considerable influence, and many electors of his time readily sought'his
advice as to which way they should go in a contest. Mr. Moss was a man
of strong individuality, and a stickler for what he believed to be the
right. Though a member of the Hebrew faith, he always closed his
business premises on the Christian as well as his own Sabbath. He
was one of the most earnest men in all that he undertook in the public
interest, and he proved one of the most useful citizens the
had. He was an alderman of the Nowra Council for many years, and
six years Mayor. He was the founder of the “ Abercorn ” Lodge of
Freemasons, and did much for the Craft in the South Coast districts.
Mr. Moss contributed largely to the metropolitan and coast press, and
he was the composer of some verses which attractedmonsiderable atten-
tion. He died on the 18th September, 1887, in his 58th year, leaving a
widow, five daughters, and three sons. An obelisk stone subscribed
for by the public and erected in the Nowra cemetery and unveiled in
1888, fittingly perpetuates the memory of a man who was widely es-
teemed for his public and private life, and to whose labors Shoalhaven
owes much.
—o
It is pretty generally known that since the death of Mr. David Berry,
the management of the Berry Estate and direction of its many rami-
fications have to a large extent devolved upon Mr. Alex. Hay, who
must share with his brother the commendation universally given for
the improvement of the district and expansion of its industries. A
complete statement of Mr. Alex. Hay’s efforts locally and of his investi-
gations abroad for the benefit of the Shoalhaven farmer would be too
much for the publisher’s present resources.

ABORIGINAL NAMES OF PLACES.
The latei.Hon. Geo. Thornton, M.L.C., who was one of the best authori-
ties of his time on the language of the aboriginal, several years ago pub-
lished some notes, in which he gave the proper native rendering of names
and their respective meanings, pointing out at the same time, that the
aboriginal dialect differed much within distances of 70 and 80 miles.
For example, the language of the Sydney, or Botany Bay blacks, was
quite unintelligible to those of Kiama and Shoalhaven. Bondi should
be “ Boondi,” meaning the noise made by the sea breaking on the beach
there. 1 TCoogee, should be “ Keojah” —bad smell ; Maroubra —“ Meroo-
berah,” a pretty sandy beach, and the name of the chief of the tribe
inhabiting that part. Bunnabee is the aboriginal name of North Botany
Head, and “ Givea ” that of the South Botany Head ; “ Kundul,”
aboriginal name for the spot at which Captain Cook landed. Bulli
means two, the name being applied to the formation of the mountain
range about there. The district name Illawarra was first pronounced
“ Elouera,” and since corrupted to Allowrie. Wollongong should be
“ Woolyungah,” meaning five islands ; Kiama, —“ Kiaremia,” meaning
fish may be caught from the rock there ; “ Minnamurra,” —plenty fish ;
“ Coolangatta ” signifies the highest land ; “ Moonah ” is the name of
[C. S. Moss .

the inside of Jervis Bay, and “ Booderee ” that of the entrance thereto.
“ Cooroombong,” the aboriginal name of the estuary at Jervis Bay, since
corrupted to “ Currumbene ” Creek. Wandandian means the home
of the lost lovers. “ Berrewerri,” or “ Bherwerre,” a crossing place.
Ulladulla ” is a corruption of the native name “ Wolladoorh ” —safe
harbour. “ Yatteyattah ” means “water tumble down”; “Cambe-
warra “ fire mountain.”

Mr. JOHN GLANVILLE, J.P.
One of the earliest pioneers of Shoalhaven, and, at the time of his death
one of the oldest residents, was John Glanville, who came to N.S.W.
when 25 years of age, and
settled at Wogamia,
Shoalhaven River, where
most of his days were spent,
and where several of his
sons now reside. He was
a Cornishman by birth, the
fifth son of Richard Glan-
ville, of Colomb Major,
Cornwall, and was in his
85th year when he passed
away, September 23rd,
1900, at Nowra, leaving a
widow and grown up family
of five sons and four daugh-
ters. He was one of the
earliest appointed Justices
of the Peace, and for a long
period sat regularly on
the Nowra bench, in which
position he was, perhaps,
one of the most impartial
and fearless of men. The
esteem in which he was
held as an upright magis-
trate and useful citizen
was amply shown by offi-
cial references to him at
the first sitting of the Court after his demise. As an agriculturist, John
Glanville achieved considerable success, and from out of his abundance
he contributed largely towards charitable objects and his church. He
was of that class of sturdy, persevering pioneers, to whom
in the pride of their manhood strong,
The hardest work was never too hard,
Nor the longest day too long.


The widow, than whom no man could have had a better help-meet,
did not long survive the old gentleman. She died in her 80th year, at
Nowra, November 29th, 1903, —passing away, like her life-partner,
full of years and honor.”
o
Mr. WILLIAM LOVEGROVE.
Any publication purporting to give an account of Shoalhaven and its
settlement and progress, would not be complete without mention of
Mr. William Lovegrove, who, although most of his days here a civil
servant, found time to help the district along in various ways. Mr.
Lovegrove came to Shoalhaven in 1852, in the schooner “ Bard’s Legacy”
35 tons (Captain Whitfield). At that time it was considered impossible
for a steamer to take up the trade in opposition to the sailing boats that
charged £2 15s. to £3 per ton freight on potatoes, because of the sand
and mud flats in the Crookhaven. On returning to Sydney Mr. Love-
grove consulted Mr. Williams, the American consul, and Mr. Edye
Manning, with the view to establishing steam communiciaton. Mr.
Manning suggested that the plan’should be carried out with the help of
the William the IV., a colonial hardwood steamer, as broad as she was
long, and able to steam but four miles an hour, exclusive of wind. Mr.
Lovegrove rejected the idea at once, and the matter ended in a few
friends, Messrs. Wm. Manning, T. S. Mort, Robert Tooth, the Hon. E.
Lord, Mr. Williams, Mr. Edye Manning, and Mr. Lovegrove forming the
bulk of a company, the last-mentioned going back to Shoalhaven to
see what interest the district would take in the matter. The sum of
£4OOO, including Mr. Lovegrove’s own subscription, was raised in Shoal-
haven towards the project, and thus was formed through Mr. Love-
grove’s instrumentality, the first Illawarra Steam Navigation Company.
He surveyed and charted the river entrance, assisted by Captain Noel,
in a skiff which he (Mr. Lovegrove) had sailed from Wollongong. Very
great difficulties beset the old company, for, in spite of Mr. Lovegrove’s
urgent disapproval, the company purchased in Sydney for the river
service, the steamer Planet, which was quite unsuitable on account of
her draught. The Nora Creina was the sea steamer. Mr. Lovegrove
also examined the whole of the navigable waters of the Shoalhaven
River and Broughton Creek, and for a time worked the river service.
On the Ist January, 1857, Mr. Lovegrove was appointed Government
resident official, the service until then having been performed by a
monthly visit by Mr. Meares, from Kiama. The bench of magistrates
consisted of Dr. McKenzie and Mr. Thomson, of Burrier. Mr. Love-
grove assisted largely in the erection of the first church in Shoalhaven, —
that at Terara, which was built on land given for the purpose by Mrs.
De Mestre. There was great difficulty at this time in getting settlers
on to the land. The surveyors preferred to measure the clearer lands
where they could earn more money and the more easily, and the scrub


lands were marked “ inaccessible.” Mr. Lovegrove set himself to get-
ting an alteration made in the law, and in 1861, Mr.
John Robertson, brought in his Land Act, which provided for selection
before survey. Mr. Lovegrove’s official duties were not confined to
Shoalhaven. He had to visit Ulladulla as Crown Lands Agent, etc.,
and on many occasions had to swim his horse across the Falls Creek,
and other streams, on his way between the two districts. His residence
was at Terara, and he was one of the victims of the flood of 1860, his
house, furniture, and many valuables being entirely swept away in that
the first disaster of its kind known to occur in the district, although
Mr. Alex. Berry had been in Shoalhaven since 1822. This flood, as
many still living know, caused immense loss in life and property. Mr,
Lovegrove took an active part in all matters for the public good. He
assisted in, and was elected Mayor on, the formation of the Central
Shoalhaven municipality ; he was a foremost worker for the establish-
ment of a School of Arts at Terara, of which the foundation stone was
laid amid much ceremony, but the completion of which was blocked by
the ’7O flood, and ultimately abandoned. The dredging of the Crook-
haven Creek, which relieved the district much in times of flood, was
carried out by him. At his own expense he erected floodgates and suc-
cessfully carried out a drainage scheme on what is still known as Love-
grove’s Swamp. If the neighbors had at the time co-operated with him
an enlarged area could have been permanently brought into profitable
use. On his leaving Shoalhaven, however, the floodgates, which were
neglected, soon fell to pieces, and the salt water reclaimed the land,
Mr. Lovegrove was always a strong advocate for the erection of the
bridge over the Shoalhaven at Nowra, and he was and still is persistent
in his agitation for the extension of the railway to Jervis Bay. He was,
with others elsewhere mentioned, one of the founders of the Shoalhaven
Agricultural Society, the first exhibitions in connection with which,
over thirty years ago, were held at Terara ; and he was for many years
its President. Many other public works and institutions and claims of
charity have benefited by his support, and it is pleasant for his many
friends to feel that he is now enjoying the fruits of a life well spent for
the benefit of his country and its people, in an easy conscience, and a
rest from work and worry, in the happiest surroundings a man’s home
and family can bestow. After more than thirty years’ faithful service
to the Government he practically resigned his position to contest the
election of a member for Shoalhaven. He emphatically protested against
the cry of Freetrade v. Protection claiming so much attention as it did
at the time, while the finances of the country were drifting, and his-
prophecies were only too true, as Australia was just about to be visited
by one of the most appalling financial crises she is likely to experience.
He was defeated by 52 votes. He shortly afterwards, with his family,
departed to Sydney, where he has since resided. Mr. Lovegrove is a
gifted musician, was for many years organist at the Church of England
at Terara, and assisted in many entertainments. He married Melanie,
daughter of the late Mrs. M’A. De Mestre, who owned the well-known
Terara Estate, and he has a family of four sons and five daughters.

Mr. JOHN MONAGHAN.
Mr. John Monaghan, a well-known agriculturist, was born at Mayfield,
Shoalhaven, (>9 years ago —one of tire first white natives, if not actually
the first of them, born in the district. He has from his youth taken
great interest and an active part in public movements. He was one of
the first aldermen of the Central Shoalhaven Council, and for a term
occupied the offi ;e of Mayor. He also had a seat in the Nowra Council,
and in the South Shoalhaven Council for a time. He was one of the
founders of the local Agricultural Society, and has been a member of
its committee of management since its formation, occupying the position
of President several times. Other positions occupied by Mr. Monaghan
are —trustee of the Nowra Showground, Roseby Park, Nowra Presby-
terian Church ground, and Pyree School of Arts. He has been a Justice
of the Peace over thirty years, and a member of the Licensing Bench
ever since the present Act was passed. He has also been a member of
the local School Board for many years, and was a promoter and one of
the first directors of the old South Coast and West Camden Co-operative
Company. Mr. Monaghan’s farm at Mayfield is one of the best proper-
ties on the coast. His eldest son is a farmer at Alstonville, Richmond


River district ; his second son, an M.A. of the Sydney University, has
a position in the N.S.W. Public Instruction Department, and a similar
position is occupied by his youngest daughter. Mr. Monaghan has a
family of ten, and is a widower, his wife having died several years ago.
Mr. D. THORBURN.
Mr. David Thorburn, who died at Jasper’s Brush. January Kith.
1904, was a successful worker in the movement which began amongst
farmers some years ago for the co-operative production and disposal
of butter, maize and other farm produce. He was essentially a leader
of men, and by his demise the district lost one of its most valued resi-
dents, and one whose energy and force of character had largely aided
many movements. He had followed farming pursuits all his life, and
had the confidence and esteem of many people ; was chariman of the
Coastal Farmers’ Co-operative Society from its inception, representing
1400 producing shareholders ; for a time President of the Berry Agricul-
tural Society ; and a member of the Kiama Pastures Protection Board,
and Dairy Farmers’ Union Executive. He died at 58 years of age.


Mr. G. U. ALLEY.
Mr. George Underwood Alley was born at Jamberoo, on
January 10th, 1840, and is the second son of the late Dr. G.
Underwood Alley, who came to Shoalhaven in 1853, and
settled at Bnrraga (Pig
Island), a large tract
j of arable land in the
river opposite Terara.
Here young Alley
worked on a farm
until a big flood (1860)
came down and washed
away his parents’
home and all their be-
longings, Mr. Alley
and others on the
island having provi-
dential escapes from
drowning. Mr. Alley
afterwards tried his
1 tick on the Shoalhaven
River diggings, and
had fair success, but
he soon returned with
a desire to continue
agricultural pursuits.
He settled at Sassafras,
then a very thickly
timbered portion of
country, and can claim
to being the pioneer of
that place, now so
well known for its salubrious climate and agricultural productiveness.
He selected portions of land under Sir John Robertson’s Act, and has
resided there ever since, holding 700 acres freehold, and some 30,000
acres of leasehold land, upon which large numbers of stock are depastured
in drought times. Mr. Alley has been connected with the Shoalhaven
Agricultural Society since its establishment, and was for a time a mem-
ber of’its executive. The producing value of the Sassafras district was
first brought prominently before the public by him ; and his success
(in exhibiting at the local shows, especially in fruits and dairy produce
in which latter section he was champion prize-taker for some years),
provided a great advertisement for his district. In his youth, Mr.
Alley was a keen sportsman, as he is still, and a record of his successful
performances as a runner and cricketer would fill some pages. Mr. Alley
married at the age of 21, and has reared a family of ten. At no place
in the country can the visitor be assured of a more hearty welcomeHhan
at the comfortable and healthilv-situated homestead of “ Ocean View.”

Mr. DAVID HYAM.
One of the oldest and best known residents of Shoalhaven is Mr. David
Hyam, than whom few men of his years show more vitality. Mr. Hyam
was born at Jamberoo, N.S.W., February 18th, 1836, where he resided
with his parents until 1846 r
when they removed to
Kiama, and two years later
came on to Shoalhaven,
where Mr. Hyam has since
continuously resided. At
nineteen years of age he
commenced farming at
Bamerang, up the river,
with his brothers Solomon
and Aizley. In 1858 he
married the second sur-
viving daughter of William
Graham, of Mayfield, and
has now a grown-up family
of ten. When farming, at
Bamerang in 1860 he lost
his house and crops in the
great flood of that year,
and, with other settlers,
was left homeless for the
time being. Removing to
Greenhills. he recommenced
farming, but, finding it an
unprofitable occupation, he entered into business which he carried on in
Terara for a number of years, at the same time attending to pastoral
pursuits. Twenty years ago he started to raise a herd of pure and grade
Jersey cattle, from which some of the best cows in New South Wales
have been produced, and have yielded from 151bs. to 27lbs. of butter
per week each. The cows have won nine-tenths of the butter-test
prizes at the Agricultural Shows on the South Coast during the last ten
years. The farming and dairying at Greenhills are now carried on by
D. Hyam and Son. Mr. Hyam has three good farms —one at Greenhills,
one at Mayfield, and one at Nowra Hill, the three being used for dairying
and rearing young stock. Mr. Hyam has been an alderman over 32
years ; has been four times Mayor of Central (now South) Shoalhaven,
and twice Mayor of Novara. He is a Justice of the Peace, and a member
of the Old-Age Pensions Board for the district. Mr. Hyam’s father
(Mr. Michael Hyam) a native of London, arrived in the colony in 1828,
in the merchant vessel George Canning, by which ship also arrived the
Snodgrass and Cooper families.
The photo here given of Mr. Hyam was taken sixteen years ago.,
still it will be readily recognised by those who know him.


BENDIGO REVISITED AFTER FIFTY YEARS.
To one who landed on the shores of Port Phillip in 1852, when the
harbour was crowded with 120 sailing vessels, laid up for want of crews,
and the environs of Melbourne were vast canvas towns, the fascination
of a trip to the scene of one’s early struggles in that year, could not be
resisted.
What a mighty transformation greeted the astonished gaze of the
writer.
In 1851 vast forests covered the land. Shady gums and bright
wattle trees were the homes of birds of loveliest plumage, laughing
jackasses filled the air with their strange but not unmusical sounds;
creeks of clear water flowed down the gullies, and on the flats around
the native grasses gave pasturage to wallabies, kangaroos, and emus.
All nature was aglow, and it seemed a joy to live.
But what is here ? Gold ! yellow, glittering, precious gold !
“ This yellow slave
Will knit and bind religions, bless the accursed,
Make the hoar leprosy adored ; place thieves
And give them title, knee and approbation
With senators on the bench : this it is
That makes the wappened widow wed again.”
—Timon of Athens.
And so man came, and lovers of this rich, rare, precious metal
spread over the land in thousands ; the forests with their feathery
tribes disappeared ; even the earth itself was not allowed to rest, for
the bright and virgin soil from three to eight feet deep was ruthlessly
cast into the diggers’ puddling tub, reduced to liquid mud, which after
its precious treasure was extracted, was allowed to run to waste down
the gullies beyond, and what was left, you ask. The everlasting rocks.
And are they bare now ? Oh, no ! The transformation is not yet
complete. It was found when the alluvial, or poor-man’s diggings,
were exhausted, that tons of gold still lay hidden in the quartz reefs
below to a depth of 3000 feet. Shafts were sunk, machinery erected,
capitalists invested all their income in this great industry, and enormous
wealth was the result. The quartz was brought by millions of tons to
the surface, crushed, treated, and the debris used to fill up the erstwhile
denuded gullies, and perforated flats —in fact to level the whole surface
of the land, and fit it to erect villages and towns and magnificent cities
upon, which to-day adorn the district.
And so when I go to look for the old holes in Eaglehawk Gully , out
of which I captured half-an-ounce of gold per day, I find the place occu-
pied by a handsome town-hall, and around it, in a substantially built
township, over 7000 inhabitants have made a permanent home, ren-
dered attractive by a beautiful lake, formed in the bed of the old gully,
surrounded with gardens and ferneries, worthy of a large city, and


within which nature has been wooed to give the welcome shades of new
and ornamental trees. It was not far from this gully, on the White
Hills, that Lord Salisbury lodged in 1852.
A visit to it now would electrify him, for men enter it not under the
burden of a swag, but by an electric tram from the great centre of the
district Sandhurst, four miles away, for the sum of threepence. Time
and space will not permit me to attempt a description of this town, its
population of 36,000 ; its beautiful streets —90 miles of which are
planted with elms, oaks, fir and gum trees, from which it has been called
the “ Forest City ” —its Pall Mall, Charing Cross, and Alexandra Foun-
tains, Town Hall, Mechanics’ Institute, School of Mines, Post Office,
and other public buildings —such as Mining Exchange, Hospital, and
Benevolent Asylum.
One of the best appointed hotels in the State, “ The Shamrock,”
attracts the numerous tourists, that visit the public gardens, and con-
servatories, churches and great State School.
How vast is the wealth of this greatest of all Australia’s goldfields
may be realised from the statistics which show that £60,000,000 worth
of gold has been extracted from its mines apart from that taken away
privately, estimated at £1,000,000.
The value of the great mining plants in Bendigo in 1890 was £483,241.
The number of miners at work during the same year was 3888.
Enough has been said to set the enquiring mind thinking, and if
any intending tourists should read this short sketch, be assured that no
more interesting or health-giving spot can be selected for a few days
sojourn. Any old Bendigonians of the fifties, if such there are in either
the Hawkesbury or Shoalhaven districts, may on application to Wood-
hill & Co., secure a glance at the records of these old and stirring days,
and see Bendigo as it is in 1905.

Regulation of Food. —Food is often forced upon people when
they are not feeling well, from a misunderstanding of its real use. To
add more food to the task of an overburdened digestion is to pour oil on
fire. A day’s fast, even two days of almost total abstinence from food,
in the case of an adult, cannot hurt the individual, and will always prove
a better and more enduring remedy than medicine. Our first thought
if any one is ill, is—What can we get him to eat ? If the baby cries we
run for the bottle, no matter if the stomach has given indisputable
evidence of its inability to dispose of what it has already received. Not
till that long suffering organ has had time to adjust itself to a cessation
of physical activity and to dispose of its accumulation, should food be
even suggested.
Eat slowly, cut up all the food into pea-sized pieces, chew deliber-
ately, in a cheerful mind, and then you can afford to eat all you want
without the penance of getting up from the table hungry.


THE HAWKESBURY.
At a very early stage in the history of the colony, the Hawkesbury conies
prominently into view. On the 7th January, 1788, the colony of New
South Wales was inaugurated. On the 2nd May, in the same year the
Governor and party, sailed off in the long boat, for the purpose of
exploring Broken Bay, which had been seen and named by Captain
Cook, but not entered. It proved to be the entrance to a large river
expanding to an immense width, and abounding in exquisite natural
scenery.
Having crossed the bar, three distinct divisions of the bay were
explored, and to one the name of Pitt Water was given in honor of tli£
celebrated English premier. Next year this success was followed up
by the exploration of the river which was continued as far as Richmond
Hill.
What precisely is meant by Richmond Hill spoken of in the early
annals of the colony, is not very clear, whether it was meant to designate
the terrace over against Richmond, or the Kurrajong Heights ovei-
looking it from a greater altitude.
Richmond Lowlands—from Terrace.
The result of this expedition was the discovery of large alluvial flats
on both sides of the river, which were destined at no distant date to
become the homes of an industrious agricultural population who fre-
quently saved Sydney from the horrors of famine.


In 1795, seven years after the foundation of the colony, Captain
Hunter arrived from England as second governor. He brought out a
number of free settlers mostly farming men, and these having been sent
to the Hawkesbury, farming was successfully started, and in a short time
more than (5000 acres were under crop of wheat and maize, but owing to
the prevalence of rust, wheat is not so much cultivated now as then.
However, it is gratifying to know that experiments are at present being
made at the farm connected with the Agricultural College to counteract
the influence of rust, which if accomplished will create together with the
development of the dairying industry fostered by creameries and fac-
tories, a complete revolution in the prospects of the district.
The fertility of these lands is proved by the enormous yield in good
seasons of from 80 to 90 bushels of maize to the acre.
The blacks were at one time very numerous in this district, but in
the sad process of so-called civilisation they have entirely disappeared,
leaving behind them few relics of the past, some stone hatchets or mogos,
which are occasionally turned up by the plough.
Hostilities occurred between the blacks and the whites at an early
period, and some of the old inhabitants give lamentable accounts of
depredations and murders committed by both parties. The blacks were
sometimes said to be troublesome and “ had to be dispersed ” by the
military (and it would appear from the tombstone of Joseph Hobson,
vho was killed by them in 181(5, that they gave great provocation),
though it cannot be denied that the advent of the white interfered very
much with their roving habits, and roused a spirit of retaliation.
In point of natural beauty the Hawkesbury is unsurpassed by any
xivei in the colony. Its serpentine windings and sudden turnings, and
the picturesque and beautiful blending of land and water which it pre-
sents especially in the lower portions of its course won for it universal
admiration. It is already a favourite route for tourists, and is destined
to become increasingly so.
The Hawkesbury district has not been progressing of late years so
rapidly as it did in the earlier years of its history, the population is
scarcely larger than it was thirty years ago.
At that time, before the era of railway's, the major part of the carry-
ing trade of the interior was performed by residents on the Hawkesbury.
There was at one time a much larger farming population than there
is now. Various causes have contributed to check its growth, the floods
exerting an expulsive force on the one hand, and free selection exerting
an attractive one on the other, the result was that many families passed
over the mountains into the interior in the hope of bettering their con-
dition.
Of late years agriculture is being largely supplanted by grazing,
which, though an important and useful industry, tends to reduce rather
than increase the population, the old families whose names figure largely
in the history of the colony as well as of the district, have now passed
away, leaving in the case of most of them, scarce a representative behind.
There has been a change, but not in all respects for the better. There is


I ■
much talk of dull times, of lack of money, and lack of employment, yet
one cannot help thinking why it should be so.
One cannot look at the condition of things as they are, without
conceiving to himself what, under better management they might be-
come. One might picture to himself the dilapidated and unattractive
cottages swept away to make room for elegant residences, that would
attract those who prefer the enjoyments of the country to the pleasures
of the city. He might picture to himself the romantic and fertile slope
of the Kurrajong overspread with beautiful villas, the healthful homes
of those who had secured a competency for themselves amid the turmoil
of city life. He might picture to himself the thousands of acres of
admirable soil around our town now lying waste and unoccupied,
studded with substantial homesteads and surrounded with thriving
orchards and vineyards and with perpetual verdure from year’s end to
year’s end.
Cattai Creek, Hawkesbury River.
Is this a mere fancy picture, a dream of the imagination ? It is no
extravagance, we hold, to maintain that all, this is within the bounds
of possibility. The conviction is growing that such a happy state of
things is within our reach, and that if we had a reasonable measure of
that spirit of enterprise which has wrought wonders elsewhere the con
summation we desire might easily be attained. Iwo things mainly are


wanted for the end in view, —increased facilities for transport, and a
more abundant application of the fertilising power of water. And
water we have in abundance, sometimes in excess.
Something, we imagine, might be done to mitigate the severity of
our floods ; but the floods if they do harm, do also good, and are needful
to replenish the impoverished soil.
What above all is needed is the judicious application of artificial
watering when the heavens are shut and no dew descending.
With a soil so rich, and a climate so genial, if only to these were
superadded an adequate and duly regulated supply of the necessary
moisture it would be hard to set limits to the measure of productivity
that might then be looked for.
Mr. Wilkinson, G.G.S., in his admirable lecture to the Young Men’s
Christian Association (July 23rd, 1886), thus alludes to the state of the
river : —“ Richmond is situated on a wide-spreading alluvial ground ;
but within a few minutes walk in a northerly direction from the railway
station we find a sudden descent of about 30ft. on a low, level, rich
alluvia flat, through which winds the Hawkesbury River as it flows
over a broad sandy bed, on its course to Broken Bay and the ocean.
When examining this place, with my friend Dr. Woolls, I was informed
that the river here, not many years ago, was navigable for boats of large
size. Since then its channel has been filled up, and the water flows in
shallow rippling currents over shifting sands.
“ Now, I have brought you to this beautiful and picturesque valley
of the Richmond because we have here some remarkable evidences of
geological changes. Nature here makes no secret of her working
agencies and we only want observant minds to understand why the hill
on which we stand is formed of dark shale rock why the river channel
here has been so recently silted up ; why there are low-level and high-
level alluvial flats ; why the hill up which the Kurrajong road winds is
composed of sandstone ; why the higher hills beyond are covered with
rich volcanic soil —and in these we perceive that great changes must have
taken place. Nature gives the silent answer, as she points with one
hand to the sand rolling along with the rippling water down the river
channel, and, with the other hand uplifted, to the old volcanic rocks on
the summit of the Blue Mountains. The answer is coming, 4 That
volcanic rock tells of subterranean forces which have at various times
made the earth tremble, and have uplifted some of her loftiest mountain
peaks ; and that river has for untold ages been flowing from the moun-
tains to the sea and incessantly carrying down earthy sediment, sand
and gravel, to be deposited in the bed of the ocean, or wherever the
transporting current ceases.’ No estimate has yet been made of the
denuding work which this river is doing, and it is hoped that some of the
local residents will undertake to make observations of it.
It is a strange fact that weeds, including some very troublesome
ones, are brought down by the floods, and several species of the com-
posite order are spreading rapidly. Some quite unknown to the early
settlers (wedelia hispida and aster du mosus ), have regularly established


themselves on the banks of the Hawkesbury, whilst grasses, equally
unknown here in days past, have found their way among the cultivation
—one grass especially, called water couch (paspalum distichum), which,
at the beginning of the century, occurred only near the coast.
The neighbourhood of Richmond is decidedly healthy, having, in

proportion to the population, a greater number of old people than in
any part of the colony. But the heat during the summer is sometimes
very great, the thermometer rising occasionally to 110 degrees in the
shade, whilst in the winter sharp frosts are of frequent occurrence.
Among the principal agricultural and orchardists near the banks of
the Hawkesbury, are Messrs. Biddle, Bayley, Douglas, Devlin, Clempson,
Conlon, Davenport, Farlow, Freeman, Hough, Nolan, Powell, Parker,
Pitt, Pearson, Phillips, Reynolds, Stone, Smith, South, Waters, Waldon,
Williams, and Woods.
o
Sanitation. —The soundness of the sanitary arrangements of a
house is taken for granted, and never questioned until drain-begotten
illness has broken out. In other words we employ illness and death as
our drain detectives. A house in which children and servants are often
ailing with sore throat, headache, or diarrhoea is probably wrong in its
drainage. Never use for domestic purposes water derived from a well
situated in a street of a town or village, or in proximity to dwellings.

The above Institution was opened in 1891 with twenty-five students,,
which number, in consequence of its deserving popularity and eminent
usefulness, has been steadily increasing until over 120 of our future
agriculturalists, orchardists, squatters, vignerons, and horticulturalists
are now preparing for the work of going in to possess the land, and
develop its vast resources, by the aid of modern science and practical
knowledge. The magnificent property, consisting of over 4000 acres
of land varying in character, etc., will, when complete with the proposed
new buildings, be a valuable addition to the National Estate, and the
great centre from which a mighty force shall go out to make our plains
prolific, our valleys yield their fatness, and the dry and thirsty bush the
home of a numerous and prosperous peasantry.
The Hawkesbury Agricultural College and Experimental Farm is
situated on a gentle slope overlooking the town of Richmond, about one
mile from the railway station, and in close proximity to the Kurrajong
Heights and Blue Mountains.
Richmond is 38 miles from Sydney, with which it has a service of
three passenger trains daily.
The Farm comprises an area of 3500 acres of land suitably fenced
and subdivided. About 1000 acres are under cultivation.
Special care has been taken to make the farm equipment ample for
the work of the Institution, and of the most modern type. It consists
of large and commodious farm buildings, lecture hall, class-rooms,
laboratories for practical work in chemistry, physics, botany, entomologv
and bacteriology.
Experiments. —One hundred acres of the farm are set apart and
laid out in small plots, and series of experiments and tests with roots,
grasses, cereals, manures, and methods of cultivation are systematically
conducted from year to year under the direction of an experienced
agriculturist.
The Dairy Farm is well stocked with suitable breeds of dairy cattle.,
and provision is made to teach dairying in all its phases. The dairy is

fully equipped with the most recently designed appliances for the
treatment of milk and the manufacture of butter and cheese.
The Piggery contains seven of the best breeds of pigs. The boars
and sows are representative of the various types, and have been selected
and imported from the best strains of blood in England and America.
Bacon-curing is carried on extensively for the instruction of students.
The Horticultural Department includes a fully stocked orchard, a
cannery, vegetable garden, and other accessories required to give prac-
tical instruction in fruit growing, preserving, and packing, also market
gardening.
The Poultry Section is replete with pure bred examples of the best
varieties of table and laying fowls, ducks, turkeys and geese. The
equipment includes the best forms of incubators, brooders, &c. Ostrich
farming also forms a part of this section.
The Library contains about 3000 volumes of books, pamphlets, &c,,
chiefly relating to agriculture and its allied industries ; history, bio-
graphy, science, and fiction are also represented. It is open for refer-
ence and consultation daily by staff and students. Books may be taken
at suitable intervals under the supervision of the Librarian.
The Reading-room is replete with all the leading daily and weekly
newspapers of the Australian States as well as the best technical,
agricultural, and live stock journals published.
The Gymnasium is well lighted and equipped with all the appliances
for physical culture. It is also used as a concert hall, and is provided
with a piano.
Recreation grounds are provided for football and cricket, also two
lawn tennis courts.
A rifle club is formed at the College with sixty rifles, and the re-
quisite rifle range, butts, and targets are on the farm.
A branch of the St. John’s Ambulance Society has been formed to
teach first-aid to the sick and wounded, and is under the direction of
the medical officer.
The College is a meteorological station in connection with the
Government Observatory, and is furnished with the principal instruments
and apparatus for meteorological observations and records.
At present 130 students are on the College roll, and provision is being
made to increase living and other accommodation to increase the roll
to 160 students. So far the applications far exceed the number for
which provision is made.
An interesting Journal , well illustrated, is issued monthly, edited
bv the principal, and is the official organ of the Old Boys’ Union. Stu-
dents who have passed through the College course form this Union.
By means of the journal they are enabled to keep themselves acquainted
with the latest experimental and other work, and in keeping in touch
with each other.
The College attracts visitors from the whole of the Commonwealth
and other parts of the world. Over 4000 visitors were entertained last
year, most of whom were graziers and farmers, whose mission chiefly

was to acquire information and investigate modern methods of agricul-
ture as conducted on the College Farm.
Objects of the Institution.
The primary object that the Department of Agriculture had in view
in establishing the above-named College and Farm was to teach the
science of agriculture and the various other sciences connected therewith,
and their practical application in the cultivation of the soil and the
rearing and management of stock, and qualify its students, as far as
possible, for the profitable management of farms, dairies, orchards, or
vineyards, either as proprietors or paid managers of same.
To this end it is deemed indispensably necessary that every young
man who may be admitted to the College shall learn to labour and be-
come proficient in the use of the various implements of husbandry
employed on the farm, and in the management of the various kinds of
live stock connected therewith. Each student, therefore, will be re-
quired to perform a certain amount of labour.
One other object held in view in establishing the Farm is the con-
ducting of experiments in various branches of agriculture, but more
particularly in respect to the comparative value of the various artificial
or commercial fertilisers, rotation of crops, and growth of plants suitable
to our climate, but not generally adopted in our agriculture.
In a word, it is designed to carry on experiments in each department
of agriculture for the purpose of improving its processes and enhancing
the value of its products.


Flood on the Hawkesbuky.
FLOODS.

rivers).
The figures given represent the heights of the floods as measured
“ above bridge deck level,” which datum stands about I;feet above
the ordinary summer level of the river By adding this 12| feet to the
heights recorded “ above bridge,” some idea of the magnitude of these
floods may be realized.

RICHMOND.
The town of Richmond is situated at 38 miles from Sydney, and is
only 61 feet above the level of the sea, being three feet lower than the
metropolis itself ; whilst the Hawkesbury River, which is only a mile
from the township, pursues a tortuous course of 144 miles to the sea.
Richmond, as dear old Bishop Barker used to say, has rather the appear-
ance of an English village, than a town ; and when viewed from the
adjacent heights it looks like a garden of the old school, laid out with
straight paths, and ornamented here and there with umbrageous trees.
It is. however, gradually losing its primitive character ; and the cedar
trees and mulberry trees, which once gave a grateful shade along the
streets, are yielding to the increased value of land, and the dignity of
the municipal arrangements.
There must, nevertheless, be always something picturesque in the
township, as it commands a fine view of the valley of the Grose, the
orange and other orchards of the Kurrajong, and the noble outline of
the Blue Mountains.
Ghose River, Near Richmond.
The town was laid out by Governor Macquarie in 1809, when his
Excellency awarded grants of land to deserving applicants on condition
that they should erect buildings according to a plan supplied, and beyond
the reach of floods. There are four churches in the township, the Church
of England, Presbyterian, Wesleyan and Roman Catholic ; three banks,


the Commercial occupying a tine new building, the Bank of New South
Wales, and the Australian Joint Stock Bank, now located in premises
formerly known as the Post Office Hotel, but so altered and improved as
to make a really substantial and handsome addition to the central town
blocks ; Post and Telegraph Office, Court House and Railway Station ;
a Park, nicely laid out and planted, with a pavilion for the accommoda-
tion of parties on holidays ; and four inns well conducted. The old inn
(kept for many years by Mrs. Seymour, and commonly known as the
" Honeymoon Inn ”) has a colonial history, as many persons of note
in days past, and some celebrities now living, spent their honeymoon
there. Amongst the archaeological treasures of Richmond is the book
in which the old lady was in the habit of registering the names of the
happy pairs. This book contains the names of many distinguished naval
and military officers (such as Gunton, Somerset, Ramsbottam, Sugard,
Rush, Fitzgerald, Leslie, Gennys, Fremantle and Moseley), and also
those of civil notoriety (such as Forbes, Macarthur, Stephen, Cowper,
Fairfax, Dibbs, Mere wether, Douglas, Watts, Mort, Dangar, and
Josephson.)
POST AND TELEGRAPH OFFICES.
The Post Office was established on January Ist, 1844. The Tele-
graphic Office was opened on January Ist, 1870.

MASONIC LODGE, RICHMOND.
The Duke of Connaught Lodge, No. 150, U.G.L., N.S.W., was founded
September, 1882, as No. 303, under the Irish Constitution, the W.Ms.
during the few years of its existence being Dr. Jockell, C. S. Guest and
S. Boughton. This lodge lapsed in 1885, and handed its property over
to a lodge formed as No. 2152 under the English Constitution, consecrated
on Friday, January 22, 1886, at the Court House, Richmond.
In 1888, this lodge, with all other N.S.W. lodges, came under
allegiance to the United Grand Lodge of N.S.W., formed in that year
as a sovereign Grand Lodge, when it became No. 150 on the Grand Lodge
roll.
Lodge Duke of Connaught met successively, after removing from the
Court House, at the Royal Hotel, and the Wesleyan Schoolroom ; and
in 1896 moved to its present well-appointed Lodge room built expressly
for the purpose, as an addition to the School of Arts. Here it has since
met on the third Tuesday in each month. Though not a strong lodge


it has been noted for its nice accommodation, its good work, its musical
and lecturing talent, and the hearty welcome always extended to visitors.
The lodge celebrated its coming of age at the Installation in March,
1904. It is also worthy of note, that the distinguished Brother after
whom the original lodge was named (the name being accepted on the
formation of its existing successor), is now M.W. Grand Master of
England.
The Grand Master of N.S.W. (M.W. Bro. J. C. Remington), visited
the lodge with his officers in 1900, and did the lodge the then unique
honour of performing the ceremony of Installing the W.M. for that year.

RICHMOND SUPERIOR PUBLIC SCHOOL.
This building is a substantially built brick structure, with slate roof.
It is situated between the School of Arts and the Police Station, while
the rear of the premises adjoins the Richmond Park, which is used by
the boys as a sports ground. The situation is splendid, and its beauty
is enhanced by oak, poplar, and other trees, whose shade is grateful
during the hot summer days.
The school was opened on July 9th, 1860, with ten pupils ; this
number rapidly rose to 100, and then the increase assumed a more gradual
growth. The present enrolment is 240, with a practical average of 210.


jllll
The school was worked as one department till 1879, when an infant
school was erected, and since then the school has comprised a Primary
and an Infant Department. In 1881, it was raised to the rank of a
Superior Public School, mainly through the energy and tutorial ability
of Mr. Chas. J. Pitt, the headmaster at that time.
The school was opened 44 years ago by Mr. Ind ; he was succeeded
by Mr. A. L. Forbes, late Examiner to the Department of Public Instruc-
tion. Then came in succession, Messrs. H. Wilson, C. J. Pitt (late

hands of Miss Helen Holmes.
PASPALUM DILATATUM GRASS AT HAWKESBURY AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE,
THREE MONTHS FROM PLANTING OUT.
All the work of the new Syllabus has been introduced in the school
with success, and a library was lately opened which is proving of much
service to the pupils. It is also intended to open a school museum
shortly, wherein will be stored natural objects for reference in the lessons,
and also curiosities and papers, etc., of historical interest.


The school ranks in Class IV., and from its proximity to Sydney it is
a position considerably sought after by the rising and energetic teachers
of the day.
Besides the Public, there are two other schools in town—the Convent
School, ably conducted by the Sisters of the Good Samaritan, and the
Young Ladies’ College, whose principal, Mrs. A. Benson, has been long
known in Richmond as a successful teacher.
The other schools in , the District are: —Kurrajong North —Mr.
Norris ; Kurrajong South —Mr. Dunlop ; Comleroy Road —Mr. Ding-
wall ; North Richmond Mr. Tomkinson ; Agnes Banks Mr.
Campbell ; Castlereagh—Air. H. Reid.

SCHOOL OF ARTS.
This thriving institution which has been a source of rational amusement
and education to the residents of Richmond for nearly half a century,
is still growing in popularity. With recent additions it has become one
of the architectural features of the town.
It had its origin in a debating society which met in the Presbyterian
schoolroom, and whose energetic members worked untiringly until they
had achieved their object, and built the School of Arts.
Of the pioneers of the institution many have gone over to the
majority, but we have still with us Rev. Dr. Cameron, Col. Holborrow.
who have steered the funds through more than one financial storm, Messrs.
Cresford, Sullivan, Myers, Pitt, Mitchell, and Boughton.
During recent years the committees have been impelled to attend to
to the material expansion of the building, about £l2OO have been spent
in improvements and the addition of several commodious rooms.
In 1900 a billiard room was added, which proved a, potent induce-
ment to the increase of membership and a valuable asset, returning' an
annual net profit of about £5O.
The number of members on the roll at the present time is 120.
The library is well stocked and is being continually added to. It
now contains about 2000 volumes. Each year about 2500 books, besides
over 1000 magazines, are issued for circulation amongst members.
The following are the officers elected for the ensuing year :—Presi-
dent, Mr. A. Brooks ; Vice-presidents : Messrs. J. Illingworth and E. H.
Woodhill ; Hon. Secretary, Mr. J. W. Allison ; Hon. Treasurer.
Mr. A. P. Biddle ; Auditors : Rev. J. H. Price and Col. Guest ; Com-
mittee : Messrs. G. E. Woodhill, N. Grant, E. D. Stewart, S. Adams and
A. J. McCoy.

PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH.
The Presbyterian Church in Richmond was built by the late George
Bowman, M.L.A., at his own sole cost, and, with the site on which it
stands, was presented to the congregation worshipping in it, in connec-
tion with the Presbyterian Church. The church was opened for divine
service in the year 1845, by the Rev. Mr. Ritchie, of Yass, and three
hundred, it is said, were present at the opening. The first minister
called to occupy it was the Rev. Win. Lumsdaine, who extended his
labors so as to include Castlereagh. After several years of active service,
he was transferred to Sydney, and started the church known as Chalmers
Church, there.
Presbyterian Church, Richmond.
Dr. Cameron was called from Carcoar to succeed him in 1856. Pen-
rith, with adjoining districts, were then added to the charge, but after
a time Penrith was made a separate charge, leaving for Dr. Cameron.
Richmond, with the associated districts of Kurrajong Heights and
Yarramundi.
The Richmond Church wears a very different aspect from that which
it originally presented. The tower and clock were added at a subsequent
date and the church much transformed and improved both within and
without. The expense of all this was borne by Mr. Bowman.


Dr. Cameron has made two trips with his family to the old country,
having been absent two years each time. With the aid of various assis-
tants and colleagues he has carried on the work throughout the district
until now, while devoting much time and labor to promoting the genera 1
interests of the Church.
The Public School in Richmond was built by the Presbyterians as a
non-vested National School, on a site granted by the Government, and
with money belonging to the congregation. The original school had soon
to be enlarged, and it speedily absorbed all the others except one. The
congregation feeling that the end aimed at had been attained —the
providing of facilities for imparting a superior education to the children
of Richmond, and having no further object in retaining it, sold it to the
Government, and employed the money in building the Sunday school
which stands by the side of the church.

RICHMOND?FIRE BRIGADE.
£*•
This brigade was formed on 28th June, 1893, by a public meeting in the
School of Arts, the late Mr. P. Ridge (Mayor), in the chair. Twenty
names were handed in to form the Brigade. They were Capt. Guest,
E. Campbell, W. Kelly, J. Buckton, A. H. Johnson, A. Styles, G. Cob-
croft, E. Marlin, J. W. Hill, R. Power, J. Pryke, J. Donohoe, W. Travis,
A. W. Sly, W. Hanchett, G. Hough, S. Dunston, J. Matthews, G.
Woodhill, and A. Benson. Capt. Guest was elected captain of the
Brigade, Mr. E. Campbell, secretary, Mr. G. Cobcroft, treasurer.
In December of 1894 Capt. Guest resigned, and Mr. G. Woodhill was
elected captain. He applied to the Government (through the then
member, Mr. W. Morgan), for £lOO to build a fire station, and in 1896
received £75, and the station was built in the same year by Mr. W.
Itchenor for £39 155., on a piece of ground granted by the Police Depart-
ment for that purpose.
In July, 1896, Mr. G. Woodhill resigned from the Brigade. Mr. G.
Daley was then elected captain, and held office until December of same
year, when Mr. J. Buckton was elected captain.
On August 31st, 1898, the Brigade was registered under the Eire
Brigades Board as a Volunteer Fire Brigade, with reel, 600 feet of hose,
six ladders, belts and spanners, and the building in a rough state.
In January, 1899, Capt. Buckton resigned the captaincy, and Mr. J.
Donohoe, the present captain, was elected. The Brigade continued
as a Volunteer Fire Brigade until January of 1902, when the partially
paid system was introduced.
The Brigade has now a station, lined and ceiled, 1200 feet of hose,
hose reel, manual engine, reducing pieces, stand-pipes, branches and
nozzles, and twelve men, all uniformed under Metropolitan style.
Their names are Messrs. J. Donohoe, captain, J. Buckton, senior fireman,
W. Douglass, S. C. Ezzy, F. Caterson, H. Reay, W. Hanchett, and W.
Douglass, engine keeper ; so that there still remain three men who joined
the Brigade of 1893.


HAWKESBURY RIVER BRIDGE AT RICHMOND.
The present bridge at Richmond is a low level structure and was built
in 1860 at'a cost of from <£9,000 to £lO,OOO bj a private company,
who collected tolls from persons using it, and was subsequently taken
over by the Government in 1876 on payment of £7,000. It has 19
Spans, each about 28 feet long, making a total length of 537 feet. The
roadway is 28 feet between kerbs, being unusually wide, and was
probably so constructed to increase the stability of the structure to
prevent its overturning. The deck of the bridge is ll| feet above
summer level of the river and in flood time is liable to submersion ; on
one occasion this happened for ten days at a time, and in 1867, the
highest Hood known, the bridge was covered to a depth of 52 feet.
It having been urged that a new and higher structure was
required, the Public Works Committee, who enquired into the schemes
submitted, recommended the adoption of a bridge (12 feet higher than
the present one) estimated to cost £22,000, and one that would reason-
ably meet all requirements of traffic.
This bridge will consist of thirteen concrete iron arch spans, each
50 feet, having an oveall length of 722 feet, with a roadway 21 feet
wide between kerbs. The arches are constructed on the monier
system. The hand-rails will be collapsible and will fold down into
recesses when the bridge is threatened to be covered by flood waters
and thus will be protected from damage. The piers between arches
are concrete caissons resting on steel shoes. The work is being carried
out by Mr. F. J. Carson, whose tender was accepted for the sum of
£18,663, the turning of the first sod being performed by the then
Premier, Sir John See, in January this year
The bridge is so designed that, in the event of tramway extension
from Richmond Railway Station and Kurrajong being carried out, it
will be strong enough to carry the tramway. It is hoped that the
work will be completed by the middle of next year.
o
Language. —English bids fair to become the universal language ;
already it is more widely spread and more freely spoken than any other
tongue. In Europe it is regarded as the language of polite society.
On the vast Australian and North American continents it is the one
speech, and in the East fully 18,000,000 of Hindus, Mohammedans,
Buddhists and others read and speak English. In point of numbers at
the present time it is exceeded by the Chinese alone. From
Whittaker’s Almanack, 1893.

COURT OF PETTY SESSIONS.
Richmond is included within the Police District of Windsor, and previous
to the year 1870 all Petty Sessions business was transacted in Windsor,
which is still the headquarters of the district. In that year, however,
a Courthouse and Police Station was erected, Messrs. Crisford and
Tomkinson being the contractors. The building is of brick with iron roof
and is situated at the corner of Windsor and West Market streets, ad-
joining the Post Office.
Railway Station, Richmond.
Mr. W. H. H. Becke, who was the Police Magistrate at Windsor,
held the dual positions of Clerk of Petty Sessions at Windsor and Rich-
mond, and was first C.P.S. at Richmond. Mr. Becke was in 188-1 suc-
ceeded by Mr. 0. A. S. Fitzpatrick (now C.P.S. at Uralla). Mr. Fitz-
patrick held this position until 1889, when Mr. Henry Beveridge was
appointed Clerk of Petty Sessions at Richmond. In 1891 Mr. Beveridge
was promoted to Gosford, and Mr. C. E. Cotter was appointed, and held
the position until 1896, when Senior-Constable J. McNeilly was ap-
pointed, and on his retirement from the service, Senior-Constable J.
Illingworth then occupied the position on April Ist. 1897.*^
Mr. F. R. Wilshire is now the visiting Police Magistrate, and is held
in high esteem, being over forty years in the service.


The Court is presided over by the following bench of magistrates :
Messrs. C. S. Guest, G. M. Pitt, J. M. Pitt, E. Pitt, J. Lamrock, P.
Reynolds, E. Campbell, P, Charley, W. Charley, A. Dunston, J. Dunston,
W. Dunstan, W. Douglass J. McNeilly, J. R. Mitchell, H. Skut iorpe r
R. Skuthorpe, H. Stevenson, E. H. Street, W. Sullivan, W. Wark, H. A,
Wood, J. T. Pyrke.
A Court of Petty Sessions is held every Thursday, and a Small
Debts Court on the first Thursday in each month. Applications for
Small Debts summonses to be made nine days before the first Thursday.
The Publicans Licensing and Revision Courts are held in Windsor—dates
as gazetted.
Dog Licenses expire on 30th September ; fourteen days’ grace.
Fee 2/6. If licensed between Ist April and 30th September, in each
year the fee is only 1/3.
The Land Office is also in Windsor, but licenses may be obtained

Senior-Constable Illingworth.
The Police Office is open during the usual office hours on week-days
and until 12 o’clock in the forenoon on Saturdays, and is closed on
public holidays.
Mr. E. Campbell, M.A., is the only solicitor resident in Richmond,
his office being in Windsor Street, Windsor. Solicitors also attend the
Court. Messrs. Campbell, C. S. Guest, and E. H. Street, are commis-
sioners for taking affidavits.
The police at Richmond have, for over twenty years been under
the control of Senior-constable J. McNeilly, and the last seven years
of Senior-constable Illingworth, who is also Inspector of Slaughter
Houses, Crown Lands Bailiff, and Inspector under the Diseases in Meat
Act, Registrar of Small Debts Court, etc., etc. Senior-constable
McNeilly had, for over 30 years, been in charge of Police Stations in
Windsor Distirct, and was a highly deserving and efficient officer.
For many years an old identity, Robert Tilling, was Bailiff of the
Small Debts Court, but on his retirement in 1891, Mr. Alfred Smith, senr.,
also an old resident, was appointed to the vacant office, which he holds
at the present time.

pennv is exactly one inch in diameter. If this coin be laid upon a map
of an inch scale it will just cover 500 acres.

KURRAJOISG.
Much of the charm of the beautiful little town of Richmond is due to
its background of hills, which combine in one grand panorama the leading
characteristics of mountain scenery.
Tins wondrous variety is the main charm of the Kurrajong Moun-
tains, now gently sloping, grassy, smiling; now sharply outlined,
precipitous, stern. Now sweeping with bold and unbroken curve, now
seamed by numberless gorges at the bottom of which silvery streams
prattle and murmur through their rocky-bedded fern-lined courses.
Now treeless and bare, now clothed with many-coloured forest shades,
all dotted over with sunny fields and deep-fruited orchards and nestling
homesteads, giving that element of human interest without which the
grandest scenery fails to touch the deepest chords of the heart. From
the Hawkesbury River these slopes rise ridge above ridge till a height
of about two thousand feet is attained, when the country dips for some
hundreds of feet, to rise again more gradually till the high mountains
in the centre of the chain are reached.
A Natural Fernery, Kurrajong.
Famous no less for its dry, cool, healthful climate, than for its
beautiful surroundings, Kurrajong has long been the favourite resort
ofjhealth-seekers and tourists, and, if for a little the much-advertised
and more easily accessible mountain resorts on the Western line ha\e
diminished the number of its visitors, we are certain that it must shortl


,
be restored to its acknowledged supremacy, when the tramway so long
agitated for shall have become an established fact.
The favorite resort is North Kurrajong, where, at a height of fitfeen
hundred feet, a pleasant little township, with its post office and churches,
commands the view of the whole country from Penrith to Colo, and
from the Hawkesbury to the sea.
“ Graced like a map the landscape lies.
Its cultured beauty stretches wide.”
The leading boarding-houses on the Northern Heights are, “ Up-
lands,” conducted by Mr. H. E. Peck ; “ Fernhurst,” presided over by
Mrs. Smith, and “ Mountain View,” the old-established home of Mrs
Pock, senr. On the South Kurrajong, within an easy distance of Grose
Vale, and the Vale of Avoca, is the pleasant holiday resort of Mrs.
McKinnon.
Kurrajong from Church Hill.
The highest points of the Kurrajong are distinguished as being the
homes of several old residents. Many who have beep fascinated by
these ideal sites contemplate “ when the tide turns,” the erection of
villas along these lovely ridges.
At the foot of this magnificent range stands the palatial residence
of Mr. P. Charley, whose vast expenditure upon this modern palace and
surrounding land has added Art to Nature’s lavish gifts, which will ever
remain a monument of the enterprise, taste, and liberality of its wealthy
owner. The picturesque position of this peerless estate is near the
junction of the Grose and Nepean Rivers.
Many valuable orchard properties are to be found among the

The water in which a joint of meat has been boiled, with the ad-
dition of a few beef or mutton bones, trimmings, or remains of poultry
or rabbit, scraps of bacon, spice and seasonings, makes excellent stock

INSTRUCTIONS HOW TO GIVE THE BISCUITS.
FOR VERY YOUNG CHILDREN, rub the biscuits very lightly on a clean nutmeg grater, or crush
very fine, and sieve through a sieve ; mix carefully with boiling water, stirring well, and give thro gh
feed ng bottle or by spoon. As there is milk in them, it is not advisable to add it. In the case of young
and delicate children, it is better to give only about half a biscuit every two hours than a larger quan-
tity less often. FOR OLDER CHILDREN, pour boiling water on biscuits as the\ are, and give by
spoon. A good way is to put a saucer over the cup or basin in which the Biscuits are placed to soak,
until they swell out, leaving no water. Later on, children can have them either whole or soaked, at
home or at school they will be found a fattening, strengthening diet for young and old.
