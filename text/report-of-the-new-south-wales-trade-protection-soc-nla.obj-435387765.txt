The First Annual Meeting of tins Society was held at Mr. John Bir-
rell’s, 47, King Street, January 20th, 1858 ; Mr. Samuel Thompson
in the chair. The chairman opened the proceedings by reviewing the
operations of the Society during the past year ; he was glad to be able
to state that many losses had been avoided by Members who had been
careful to obtain information, of which the Society had collected a valu-
able amount. He observed that the Society was already making an im-
pression among reckless traders, and this alone was an indirect advan-
tage to Subscribers. Mr. Thompson then gave a detailed account of
some of the English societies of this kind, whose success had induced
the formation of the one over which he was then presiding. The Sec-
retary then read the Report for the past year.

REPORT
FOR THE YEAR 1857.
Your Committee, in presenting their first Annual Report,
have some reason to congratulate themselves on the success
that has attended their efforts in the establishment of this
Society.
Obstacles peculiar to the foundation of such an Institution,
combined with the acknowledged apathy of the citizens of
Sydney, towards new movements, seemed at first to intimate
very decidedly that its success was more than doubtful. Your
Committee are, however, glad to state that they have been
enabled, to a considerable extent, to carry out the objects of
the Society, and believe that in several instances they have
saved individual subscribers from losses which would have
amounted to much more than the whole of the present annual
expense of the Society.
The records of the Society now contain a complete list of
all the Bills of Sale in the Colony since the passing of the
Registration Act in 1855, and show a complete abstract of
each; a list of Warrants of Attorney, since January Ist, 1856,
a list of Insolvencies, since January Ist, 1857, with dividends
paid, certificates granted and refused, &c.; a classification of
several of the leading trades in Sydney, showing the bad or
doubtful “ marks ” in each, and a mass of general information,
valuable and interesting to Merchants and Traders, being
replies to upwards of two hundred enquiries from various
members of the Society.


While your Committee have thus been diligently devoting
their energies to the benefit of their supporters, the strictest
economy has ruled their expenditure, as will be seen on refer-
ence to the Balance Sheet.
Your Committee would direct your attention to the Eleventh
Rule, which was altered at a Special General Meeting to its
present form, the original being deemed objectionable by many
well wishers of the Society; and while doing so would remind
members that it is indispensable that it should be carried out
strictly as possible.
The Committee, in conclusion, urge members to recommend
the Society, as much as possible, as it is obvious, that in pro-
portion to its increase will be its usefulness; and that opera-
tions must be necessarily contracted w’hile its funds are limited.
