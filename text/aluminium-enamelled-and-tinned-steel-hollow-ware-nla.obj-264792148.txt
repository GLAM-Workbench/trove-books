IN presenting this booklet we have endeavoured
to give the prospective buyer a complete speci-
fication of our Aluminium, Enamelled and Tinned
Steel Hollow-ware.
This range of articles is continually being supple-
mented with new lines.
We would be pleased to receive your enquiries
for any new lines that are not shown on these
pages, as our plant is being added to daily, and
the articles that you require may be in the process
of manufacture.
Our aim is to supply any article within reason, and
we are prepared to put down plant for its manu-
facture if the demand for same warrants it.
Behind all our efforts—the selection of the raw
material, the design of the utensils which we make,
the workmanship put into them, and the continual
installation of the latest machinery—is our earnest
desire to attain the highest standard of production.
Following this policy, all "KOOKA BRAND"
utensils are made only from the finest materials
obtainable. In the production of our Aluminium
Ware, which we guarantee 99 per cent, pure, all
raw material is rejected which will not analyse out
at this percentage.

ALUMINIUM
HOLLOW-WARE
SECTION
GUARANTEED 99% PURE
PURITY of ALUMINIUM
A frank acknowledgment by an eminent
authority on the purity of Aluminium.
"The British Medical Journal:"
"Aluminium is the best metal next to gold or
platinum for ordinary utensils. It is better than
silver, tor silver is more quickly corroded by table
salt than is aluminium by the acids of fruit, etc.
Moreover, the injury to be apprehended from the
results of the corrosion suffered, even if the cor-
rosion were considerable, is insignificant in the
case of aluminium, since the product of corrosion
would consist only of that which is a common
constituent of almost every ordinary food as well
as of drinking water.”
