J. F. ARCHIBALD
I have no wealth, and cannot bring
To you the gifts that else were meet;
But you at least will understand . . .
(The laden heart! the empty hand 1)
Fit tribute lacking, here I fling
These simple verses at your feet.

MOST of these verses first appeared in
the Bulletin (Australia) and the
Triad (New Zealand); some in the
Lone Hand (Sydney, N.S.W.), and a few in
the New Zealand Times, during the happy
period when that most adventurous news-
paper was admirably edited by Mr. Fred J.
Kirby.
To the Editors and Publishers of these
several prints, the Author makes cordial

VERSES FOR MARJORIE
1




GETTING UP
EYES that laugh through sleepy veils,
Soft white arms a-wreathing ;
Lips (that soothe when all else fails).
Gentle dreams of cosy night
Wistful in their breathing ;
Dainty hands all frail and white,
Dimpled cheeks and chin. . . .
Night has gone, we know not where;
Blackie’s mewing on the stair.
Waiting there for you and me. . . .
Getting-up time, Marjorie !
Blackie’s scratching on the stairs.
Get up now, and say your prayers.
Father God, if you can hear
All the things I say.
Don’t let any troubles, dear.
Bother me to-day!
When I want to scold and fret,
Keep me sweet and kind.
If your wishes I forget.
Please, God, never mind!
Please, I do try all I know,
Every now and then.
(Send that bear ... I want him so !)
Good-bye, God! . . . Amen !


DRESSING
TANGLE of hair of the fleeciest silk,
Sunlight ensnared in each exquisite tress of it,
So that her neck (that’s like roses and milk)
Covets and craves every passing caress of it.
Wee dimpled feet with impertinent toes
Baffling the socks that seem anxious to cling to them.
“ Bother! ” she says, and a tiny hand goes
Down to the toes to rebuke them and sing to them.
“ Don’t tie it that way, ’cause it comes undone.
Strings that are tied up like that always looses, dear,
Then I can’t get at ’em. . . . ’Tisn’t no fun.
Oh, but you mens are such silly old gooses, dear! ”


HER REPERTOIRE
MARJORIE prattles in English (her French,
Two or three verses, is jumbled and queer),
Marjorie’s morals, in verse, would, I fear,
Scare a respectable gudgeon or tench.
Morals are good for grown persons who strive.
Margot’s don’t matter, now Marjorie’s five.
Baby, with a horrid corse,
Frew the coffee-pot at Norse.
As it hit her on the nose,
Pappa said, “ How straight she frows ! ”
“ Where is Baby, Margery ? Tell! ”
“ Muvver, I chucked him into the well! ”
“ Oh ! . . . and I thought you loved him dearly !
This is too bad of you, Margaret, really ! ”
Willy in his nice blue sash
Fell in the fire and was burnt to an ash.
Now the r OO7ll is growing chilly.
Nobody likes to poke poor Willy.


NONSENSE
[“ A | ''ELL me a story,” says my tyraness,
X “A nice long story, awful queer an’ new!”
“ A story ? I’ve told all that I can guess.
I’ve told my stories all, Sweetheart, to you.
Whatever shall this long queer story be ? ”
The brave eyes twinkle. “ Make a new sort—see I
Papa, tell me a story ’bout a slea ! ”]
The little pink flea had a fly in his eye
And a corn on his dear little toe.
The little blue tomtits went fluttering by ;
But the little pink flea didn’t know.
The poor little flea had a cold in his dose.
And his boots were too tight for his feet;
And that’s why he didn’t care much, I suppose,
For the things that went on in the street.
The little pink flea had a mother who sighed
And a father who hung his grey head,
For the little pink flea was their joy and their pride
Now his uncles and cousins were dead.
And a terrible thing is a fly in the eye
Of a plump little flea that is pink ;
For it causes a flea to be sinful and sly—
Which is bad for the flea, don’t you think ?
6


So the little pink flea wept in grief and despair,
While little Miss Muffit sighed hard,
And the Man in the Moon stuck new straws in his hair
And softened his eyebrows with lard.
But the little pink flea sobbed in dreadful dismay
As he plucked the last roses of June,
While the little dog laughed (in the usual way)
And the dish ran away with the spoon.
[“lf I was a slea, I should shut up my eye,”
Says Marjorie. “ Then I should squeedge up the fly.
It’s a silly old dish to run off with the spoon,
And I really don’t think there is mens in the Moon.”J

NONSENSE


THE SLEEPIKINS
WHEN the sun has set and all the stars a-twinkling
and a-peeping
Spread like a blinking dust across the sky,
The Sleepikins from Dodoland come slyly, slyly creeping,
Each crooning soft a tender lullaby.
For the Sleepikins tread softly ’neath the beaming of
the moon,
And gently when the night is dark and lonely,
And the little girls they sing to all get sleepy pretty soon
As the music buzzes through each curly head.
They drop their dolls and teddy-bears, they stop their
tricks, and only—
They only, only want to go to bed. . . .
By-by!
It is nightie-time, my Dearie, time for bed !
The Sleepikins have fingers soft, delicious and caressing,
With a honey-scented soothing in their tips;
On drooping, drooping eyelids they’re a-coaxing and
a-pressing,
They’re a-toying with bewitching little lips.
Each Sleepikin comes creeping with a box of magic
dreams
Of things the most delightful and beguiling . . .
There are troops of snowy angels, there are woods and
fields and streams,
8


There arc sweets and cakes and cherries ripe and red;
There are heaps and heaps of pleasant things to keep wee
girls a-smiling,
A-smiling all the time that they’re in bed . . .
By-by!
It is nightie-time, my Sweetheart, time for bed !


DAYDREAMS
WHAT are you thinking of, Marjorie mine,
Now as you sit with a smile on my knee ?
Do you as once you did, Sweetheart, love me ?
Have you coyed yet with those ladies, the Nine ?
Soft dimpled arms that are eager to twine
As two years since. (Two years since, you were three.)
What are you thinking of, Marjorie mine,
Now as you sit with a smile on my knee ?
Ringlets delicious and brave eyes that shine !
In a few years comes the possible He.
Rogue! even now are you quite fancy-free ?
Tell me. If He’s right, I shall not repine . . .
What are you thinking of, Marjorie mine ?
10


THE SHADOWS
WHEN moonshine’s on the trees so tall
So’s night don’t seem like night at all
(Sometimes small stars let go and fall),
I watch the shadows on the wall.
Small stars sometimes get tired, you see,
And have to fall into the sea.
Such lots of stars there seems to be.
The shadows is enough for me.
The shadows is so strong and tall,
They creep, an’ creep, an’ never fall.
I hear ’em whispering as they crawl
On moonlight nights along the wall.
When I half-close my eyes, it brings
New shadows that have eyes and wings:
Bishops an’ elephants an’ Kings
An’ walruses and other things.
Then sometimes, when the Moon goes out,
The shadows climb ’way down the spout;
’Cept some too big to jump about,
And through my dreams I hear them shout.
11


Some picks me up an’ laughs an’ slips
Down coils of rope to pirate ships.
With some I go on other trips
An’ chase big whales with horns and whips.
I fire big cannons on the deck,
I dig up treasure from the wreck.
I caught a Roc Bird once. Its peck
Gave me a crick right in my neck.
I march with soldiers o’er the plain,
The Terror of the Spanish Main,
And every time I have a pain
The Shadows bring me home again.
But sometimes, when I’m tired of fight,
A star lets go and shines so bright.
So then I know that I’m all right,
’Cause Muvver’s come to say Good-Night.
12
THE SHADOWS


DIDDUMS AND DOT
DIDDUMS and Dot went out for a sail
In a beautiful pearly shell.
They started at midnight, and so very soon
They were speeding along the west coast of the Moon,
And they chartered to tow them an excellent whale,
And to guide them a gnome with a bell.
And the Moon-men came out in a silver balloon
And threw kisses to Diddums and Dot;
While a couple of mermaids climbed out of the sea
And came straight along to the cabin for tea.
So Dot gave them rice from an ivory spoon
And jam from an ivory pot.
Then the first maid brought ice and taught Diddums to
skate,
While the second taught Dot to reverse,
And the fireflies looked on with a genial smile
As the gnome with the bell rolled down hill for a mile.
But I can’t quite remember who polished the plate,
’Cause this is the end of this verse.
But presently Diddums fell out on the floor,
While Dot looked about for her shoe.
Then they let in the cat that was scratching outside.
And they ran to the window and opened it wide ;
The milkman was rattling his pans at the door . . .
And the rest of this story’s not true.
13


THE KANGAROOSTER BIRD
WHEN the Kangarooster Bird is flying, late at night,
across the houses,
While the stars are twinkling in the sky,
With his crowing and his crying all the Fairy Folk he
rouses,
Pixies whisper as they flutter by.
Then are held the nightly dances to the music of the
Moon,
While the Mother-Fairies sit beneath the daisies,
And the Fairy-Girls sip honey with a very little spoon,
And the Lover-Fairies twitter tender phrases—
In the places where they dance beneath the Moon.
When the Kangarooster Bird is singing, all the Southern
Stars are prouder
Than they are when he don’t sing at all,
Laughs the Bunyip, gladly flinging in the bass parts,
louder, louder,
Till you scarce can hear the Bell Bird call.
Oh, the Kookaburra knows the way to make the best of
night,
And the earnest Morepork combs the Mouse’s whiskers,
And the Tomcat joins the chorus with his eyes a-shining
bright,
While the Earthworm wriggles up to join the friskers.—
Things are brisk as Imps can make ’em through the night!


When the Kangarooster Bird is laughing, lots of things
you’ve never heard of
Come a-leaping, leaping, from the dark.
There’s the Gollywobterwaffing (whom you’ve never heard
a word of),
Cousin of the Jewfish and the Nark.
There’s the Double-bristled Boogoo and the Wiftish and
the Flibe,
The Whale-Hawk and the Hairy Pigliwimple;
There’s the Zookoo and the Twcekum and some others of
their tribe—
You may know them by the pinkness of their dimple.
It is simple ; but beware the furious Flibe !
When the Kangarooster Bird is flying, late at night,
across the houses,
While the stars are twinkling in the sky,
With his crowing and his crying all the Fairy Folk he
rouses,
Pixies whisper as they flutter by.


THE LITTLEBIGS
WHEN the little fishes slyly swim off from the school,
Policeman-fishes swallow every one.
When a little star gets out of bounds, the little fool
Always tumbles headlong to the sun.
When a little fledgling has no sense and leaves the nest,
Owls and snakes will eat him for their tea.
There’s a little moral which is easy to be guessed;
But what has that to do with you and me !
When a little boy steals plums all hard and round and
green—
Steals and eats ’em, knowing more than nurse, —
In a little while, where once a comfy place has been,
There’s a little tummy getting worse.
When a little girl won’t keep away from things that
burn,
Soon a sorry little girl there’ll be.
There’s a little lesson that don’t seem too hard to learn;
But what has that to do with you and me!
When a little woman thinks she owns the circling earth,
Soon her little mind will reap regret.
When a little podgy chap is proud to feel his worth,
Life has things in store to teach him yet.
When a little city smirks, her silly flags unfurled,
Boasting of her start, the more fool she.
Perhaps the little lesson is the greatest in the world ;
But what has that to do with you and me!
16


THE FROG AND THE FLEA
A FROG and a Flea went to church one day,
Just to see what there was to see.
They chattered of everything on the way,
And were happy as they could be.
The Flea was a trifle too pert and gay,
But the Frog not a frivolous word would say.
The Frog when surprised murmured, “ Oh, dear
me ! ”
But the Flea muttered wickedly, “ Oh, D ! D ! ”
The Frog walked straight, but the Flea would lurch;
Still, somehow or other they got to the church.
The Frog sat soberly, most devout,
But the Flea was a fidgety bird.
The Frog said, “ That’s helpful. Pray think it out.”
But the Flea scoffed, “ That’s quite absurd ! ”
He asked, with a sneer and a sidelong pout,
“ What can the old fossil be thinking about!
It’s the silliest sermon that ever I heard ! ”
The Frog watched the parson, and said not a word.
He sat quite attentive and grave on his perch,
And did just the things that one should do in church.
The Frog’s whole behaviour was perfect, you see;
But I can’t say a word in defence of the Flea.
And it’s perfectly plain, it’s as plain as can be,
That any reward (if reward there should be
2
17


For behaviour in church that would please you and me)
Should go to the Frog, and not to the Flea:
For a fidgety fowl and a froward was he,
That scornful, unmannerly, cynical Flea !
But a dog killed the Frog as he came out of church,
And the Flea was not left there to starve on his perch.
Rewards go astray (it’s as plain as can be),
For a lady of rank took the Flea home to tea.
And the thing in this life that’s most puzzling to me
Is the constant success of the pestilent Flea.


MARJORIE’S MESSAGE
MY joy had perished in a sea of tears,
Strewn with new pitfalls was the path I trod :
I feared the menace of the oncoming years,
The while my heart moaned still, There is no God !
Then a glow flickered in a vale of sighs—
Glowed and grew splendid in a little while,
Till in the heaven of your tender eyes,
Sweet comforter of my soul, I saw God smile.
19


THE WHITE SHIP
IF you should ever go sailing away
Down by the shores of Snooze,
Ship by a White Ship passing your way,
Whichever line you choose ;
For it’s very well known that the serious Snoozers
All wish you to come by those excellent cruisers,
And it’s certainly likely your passage you’ll lose
If you miss the right ship to the Isle of Snooze.
And as you come over the good ship’s side
(If you wish to get safe to Snooze)
Don’t stop to eat eggs, be they boiled or fried,
As you’re passing the old caboose;
For it’s very well known to all Snoozers discerning,
That eggs taken so have a trick of o’erturning
All plans for good comfort on taking a cruise
In the whitest of ships to the Isle of Snooze.
’Tis better, whenever you come on the ship,
To eat neither curds nor ham.
Avoid, if you’re thinking of making this trip,
Green cucumbers served with lamb; —
For it’s quite understood by brave Snoozers who ramble
That a trip started so is at best but a scramble.
Roast pig will destroy the delight of a cruise
(Though the sea be like glass) to the Isle of Snooze.
If you’re thirsty, you’d better pack milk for the cruise,
When you’re sailing away to the Isle of Snooze.
20


DOUGHNUTS
ONCE in the House that Jack built,
Boblets and Bloop and Pam
Had a great time (here comes a rhyme)
Feeding on prawns and ham,
Strawberries bigger than houses,
Sugarsticks long as streets
(Don’t seem a rhyme ’cept trowsis,
Though it don’t stand for sweets).
Oh, but they did have a beano—
Guzzle ! Some more ! Galoop !
(Notice ? The rhyme, I mean ?) Oh,
Boblets ! Oh, Pam ! Oh, Bloop !
Then they were chased by an ogre—
Isn’t no rhyme for that.
Since there’s no moth called scrogre—
Horrid and fierce and fat.
Boblets lassooed a dragon
(Flames for his mane and tail),
Bloops hid inside a flagon
Sour with the dregs of ale.
Pam, with a shriek of terror,
Hid in a shark’s grim maw
(Thought it a church. Grim error !) —
Largest you ever saw.
21


Then they were bound with leather,
Bound in a trembling bunch,
All of them bound together
Just for the Ogre’s lunch.
Then the Giraffe flew by them,
Winking a wicked wink.
Cuttle Fish danced quite nigh them,
Breathing in blobs of ink.
Moths flew along to chide them,
Moths quite as large as whales—
Wasn’t a thing to hide them,
’Cept for the Comet’s tails.
Sadly they cried, although knots
Can’t be undone by squeals.
Shouldn’t choose Sister’s doughnuts
When you are filching meals.
Shouldn’t, when no one’s looking,
Sneak things to eat in bed.
Never risk Sister’s cooking :
Practise at first on lead.
If you must eat in bed,
Better try rusks, although nuts
Do very well, ’tis said.
Nightmares thrive best on doughnuts.


THE TEA PARTY
LITTLE Miss Mufßt and Little Boy Blue,
Pubsky and Fiddle-de-Dee,
Went on a day when the Cow Bird flew
Up to the Moon to tea.
Story seems almost too good to be true,
But it was told to me
By Little Miss Muffit and Little Boy Blue,
Pubsky and Fiddle-de-Dee,
Little Red Riding Hood, Inky-Poo,
Humpty-Dumpty (a crackpate he.
Cousin of Boobies and mad Gloo-Gloo), —
All of them went to tea.
The Man in the Moon spread a cloth that night
That dazzled the folk below,
It was big as a mountain, and white, so white
That it worried the white, white snow;
And they sat down at teatime by candle-light
(You would have liked that, I know),
While the Moonies all chuckled to see the sight
And startled demure Peep-80,
And dimpled Peep-Bo fell right off in her fright
And landed in O-hi-o.
(This story, remember, is awfully true;
For I had it first-hand, you see,
From Little Miss Mufßt and Little Boy Blue,
Pubsky and Fiddle-de-Dee,
23


Little Red Riding Hood, Inky-Poo—
A very bad pixie unknown to you :
He says it put him in no end of a stoo—
They all came last night and confided to me
How they went to the Moon and had cakes and tea —
And crayfish and grapes, you know.
And how all the Moon-men laughed out at the sight—
They couldn’t help that, but it wasn’t polite,—
So that dimpled Peep-Bo fell right off in her fright,
Which certainly suited Ohio all right
But was dreadfully hard on Peep-Bo!)
And all were so busy with cup and with spoon
That they used all the tea that they had in the Moon.
This proves that the story is true:
As I heard it, I tell it to you.
The story’s as true as a story can be:
They went to the Moon and they drank all the tea.
But if you should doubt it, just look up and see.
You’ll see not a scrap of tea left in the Moon.
There are mountains, a Man, and (I dare say) a spoon!


THE BOOFOOLITES
ONE day the King of Boofoo Land
Thought he would go a-cruising:
Not in the dark, you’ll understand.
But long wax-candles using
To find his way along the bays
And up the mountains through the haze.
So he should not get lost o’ nights,
He took quite forty Boofoolites.
Each had two heads and twenty toes,
Each wore a Firefly in his nose.
To see them sliding on the floes
With all their Lanterns slung in rows
(To keep the Whales off, I suppose)
Was really most amusing !
But that’s the fun of cruising
Along the bays and o’er the floes
Upon bright Boofoolandish nights,
With those deep-pinkish Boofoolites,
Who catch Red Herrings with their Toes—
It really is amusing !
Next noon the King of Boofoo Land
Lay down to play the Fiddle,
And all the Oysters on the strand
Went waltzing down the middle.


The Jelly Fish and Artichokes
Laughed loudly at the Lobster’s jokes.
While all the golden Boofoobees
Were singing to the Cabbages
And spilling honey all day long
(Such waste I thought was very wrong).
The Dingbat toasting on a prong
A captivated Boofoobong,
Upraised his voice so calm and strong
To ask the Moon a riddle.
The King still teased the Fiddle
To soothe the toasting Boofoobong,
And still the downy Boofoobees
Were whispering to the Cabbages,
While straight the heaving floes among
The Moon let fall the Riddle.
But here’s the thing that puzzles Me, —
Whatever could that Riddle be !
So if you want to know the thing.
Stand on your heads and dance and cling
And catch the Bootit on the wing
With Dimples and a Piece of String;
Then give three Feathers to the King
And ask the Boofoolites to sing.
And then, as soon as prayers are said,
Tuck in your toes and go to bed !


ROSEMARY FOR REMEMBRANCE




EXHORTATIO AD ULYSSEM
For Harcourt Beatty
OLD Friend, the years race on, and Time
(That sorry thief) is pilfering
Our little store. But yet we climb,
And love all men that will be king.
Though somewhat throatily we sing,
The blessed fires are still aglow;
To dreams and memories we cling—
The unforgotten Long Ago.
In autumn we remember.—No ?
The world still holds some precious things.
With here a nymph, and there a faun;
We know the secret dells and springs,
The paths that those dear feet have trod;
We see in dream the hills of God
Like breasts of pearl against the dawn.
What was it you said yesterday,
What time we tore dull Care to shreds,
And bared each idol’s feet of clay,
And cursed all slugs and dunderheads ?
“ Pity poor slaves of featherbeds ! ”
You cried. “ Your sheltered barnacle
Can neither taste nor give delight.
I’d sooner be myself in Hell
Than some mere moth by candlelight.
29


The highway calls me still, and still
I am myself—Myself!—despite
Each leering prude and cloistered wight.
For what I want I’ll have, until
The pulse within me flickers out—
However great the things may be,
Though spacious as eternity,
However closely fenced about
By the respectable mad rout
Of dolts who think, for good and ill,
All men must caper to their will.
I choose the goods and pay the bill.
I have, I think, some saving grace
Of humour, and I don’t pretend
That Heaven gave me life to spend
To some mere altruistic end,
Or meanly set me in this place
To benefit the human race.
I live for (your own phrase, you see)
The full enfranchisement of Me ! ”
’Twas so you spoke, dear hardy soul ;
And I think with you, on the whole.
(So all old ladies will agree
You’re in disgraceful company.)
We’ve tasted pain and—hark ye, boy !
We’ve had some splendid draughts of joy.
For us the rivers rush and flow,
For us the seasons come and go,
For us Day’s glows of raptured sense
And Night’s divine magnificence,
For us the stars and whispering streams
And all the haunted place of dreams,


For us the present and the past
And kind oblivion at the last! . . .
That night in Hobart when we met.
Ten years since, was it ? I forget.
I only know it was a night
That somehow set our souls alight.
The moon lay on her back on high,
Embarrassing the conscious sky.
The dearest star of all had set
(I think) ten minutes when we met;
And we went forth, of life full fain,
To coax the wanton back again,
But setting out to question Mars,
Got lost amid a mist of stars.
And perched on Sirius for a space
More aptly to discuss the case.
Deciding (you’ll remember, lad)
That all the world was very mad,
The ’witching midnight barely sped,
To waste such brilliant time abed.
Then you (I straight forgave you) sang
Some roaring stave of Sue and Bet,
Till all the stars and welkin rang
And the nude moon made haste to set.
Twelve years ago, say ? I forget.
We’ve tasted pain since then; we pay.
Well, through the nose for some things—eh ?
We’ve known the tug of nerves askew
And suffered something ’kin to fright
Through the interminable night.
Such nights, the gods be thanked, are few.
But in the tale of years they tell—
Grey nights of tears and broken sighs.


When eerie shapes impalpable
From out a gloom as deep as hell
Stare with forlorn suspicious eyes,
And old regrets get up start
With icy hands to claw one’s heart.
Till one, all pallid in one’s bed,
Shudders to think the gods are dead.
But you—what was it that you said,
Just yesterday ? “ Bear this in mind :
However long your wounds have bled,
Let no poor worm bemused and blind
Persuade you that the gods are dead.
Men change, Friends fail, Loves prove untrue.
The gods live, young and glad, and you
Will find the gods are always kind.
Their brotherly sweetness never tires:
They help all men to their desires.
They’re strong and gay and wise and just,
And when you kneel to them and pray
They never frown and turn away.
Go straight for what you want, and they
Will freely help you all the way, 4
What they say you may have, you may;
And what they say you must, you must!
“ The goddesses, I’d have you note,
Are different. You must not plead
To them, or they will never heed;
You waste your wind and tire your throat.
The goddesses, as I’m unshriven,
Cannot be led, but must be driven.
Be meek, and the delicious shrews
Their slightest favour will refuse.


The violent tumble in pell-mell
And bear away the citadel.
As Ovid says (or Julius Knight;
I never get these authors right)—
As Julius says, or some such slim
Gallant glad herald of the truth
And lord of unsuspicious youth—
Drive them and master them, and straight
They’ll lay their treasure at your gate
And bend creation to your whim.
If you report this wise remark
Or put it in your foolish rhymes,
Pray note, lest envious rivals bark,
I speak in parables sometimes.
The gods I praise are men who try
To live full-powered until they die,
Who love and hate for all they’re worth
And make the goodness of the earth,
Nor stint the honey and the wine.
The goddesses I leave to you.
Explain them as you will; but do—
Do mention that they’re all divine ! ”
Something like this I heard you say
Amid the stress of yesterday.
So midway in this long white night
I think of you, old friend, and write
These halting lines to let you see
Your wisdom was not lost on me.
As Shakespeare says (or Souter; he
’S a great philosopher, ye see) —
’T is friendship keeps creation sweet
And holds pale Reason on her seat.


So here, with all my heart, ’s my hand,
Charles Second! Put it there, John Shand !
To decent chaps we both have known
Pass on my greetings with your own.
And you, John Shand, to pleasure me,
Treat our wee Maggie tenderly.
But, listen ! Hear me while I screech !
No lassie ever wrote a speech,
And Barrie’s statement that one made
A joke insults each sonsy jade
That makes (sometimes) a few mistakes
In that right famous Land o’ Cakes.
If e’er a lassie did such work
As write a speech or make a jest,
They’d have her up before the Kirk
And heap all Moses on her chest.
Don’t stay up after half-past three,
Lest Christchurch take you seriously.
Please Mr. Musgrove if you can—
That gentlest-mannered gentleman.
Tell Jimmy Atholwood I’ve sent
The next best thing—my halo’s lent.
Pray do not break (it isn’t fair)
The silence of Cathedral Square.
Don’t tell sleek spinsters who aspire
To shake your hand and then retire
To those vague suburbs which so tire
The soul of man—jockey or friar—
Unlettered oaf or awful liar—
Don’t tell them, lest you raise their ire,
Confusing things about the spire.
If near the Sandwich Club you stray,
And one should beckon you and say,


With ghoulish gusto, “ Beatty, pray
Come in ! ” —don’t you ; you run away,
And live to smile another day.
These Sandwichers are far too gay.
And, for their stories, I’ve heard tell
They smell of brimstone that’s unwell;
Which surely is a horrid smell.
If in the dim and desolate South
You meet some creditor of mine,
Let these facts slide from out your mouth:
“ He’s gone to live, I think, in Louth,
Or maybe in the Argentine.
He found the weather rather hot,
And went to sea with Captain Scott,
And now he tells, ’mid snow and ice,
Some stories not considered nice.
He’s gone, the Christian World relates,
To the remote United States ;
For Mr. Roosevelt needs, in truth,
Such an imaginative youth.
A lady tells me he’s been seen
At Montenegro with the Queen.
He’s living now at Reykjavik,
Where you can find him, if you’re slick;
But yesterday I heard them say
He has a mission at Bombay.
He’s teaching ladies in their teens
The way to skate —at New Orleans ;
But perhaps he’s left there now, because
When last I heard of him he was
In blessed Boston, selling beans.
He’s a bad person and, I think,
Must be by this time slain by Drink;


He even puts it in his ink.
I’ve been informed by Miss Follol,
For whom he bought a working doll,
He treats his hair with alcohol.
His flesh about his bones has shrunk
All up, he keeps so very drunk.
I’m sorry that he’s gone away
Forgetting your account to pay.
You’ll find him now in Mandalay.”
You say : “ When he does reach the tomb,
His soul amid eternal gloom
Will dwell. That’s sure to be your doom,
So you should meet him pretty soon.
Don’t mention it. Good-afternoon ! ”
Now these last precious words are said,
Good-night, old chap. I’m off to bed.


THE MOTH
A MOMENT since, here in my lamplit room,
A tiny moth fluffed soft against my face,
Eager to reach the light; but I, who knew
How pitiably armed against the flame
So frail a thing must be, took the wee thing
All gently to the window, and with care
Proportioned to its poor fragility
Gave it the freedom of the spacious night.
So in the end God’s hand shall close upon
My small, pretentious spirit, that would know
All secrets of the flame that lures me still—
The flame tremendous of His awful mind ;
And He shall bear me to a place wherein
Are neither fires nor fools to bruise my wings,
And there shall give me license to have peace
And float for ever borne upon His breath
Through all the night of His eternity.


BRIDE-SONG
(rondeau redouble)
TO-MORROW, dear, the secret I shall know,
To-morrow all my life will be complete,
To-morrow this my cup will overflow. . . .
Ah, love, my love, to-morrow will be sweet!
I’ve walked the ordered ways of life, my feet
Have never strayed where life’s full ardours glow.
I love and fear you utterly, as is meet . . .
To-morrow, dear, the secret I shall know !
lam a timid thing and frail; but, oh,
My frail timidity I now must cheat.
Give me your hand: I tremble as Igo. . ,
To-morrow all my life will be complete !
Am I a coward, that my heart should beat
Thus desperately ? Nay, love, my life is so
Demurely small. Have pity, I entreat . . .
To-morrow, this my cup will overflow !
And yet I laugh, and to the winds I throw
These vague alarms that shame me ! Sun or sleet,
Harsh winds or mellow, feverish pulse or slow,
Ah, love, my love, to-morrow will be sweet I


I hate each moment (though the hours are fleet)
That keeps me from you. I, who lie thus low,
Will climb unshrinking to Love’s perilous seat,
And dare his eyes intolerable ... I shall know,
To-morrow, dear!


SUNRISE
TO-DAY I rose just at the dawn
And welcomed back our brother Sun—■
I and the rapturous day new-born.
We saw the ancient glory spun
From mist and cloud again unrolled
In wondrous ecstasy of gold,
While emulous trees and the sweet strong
Unceasing sea shook off the dun
Close garb of night and, day begun,
Leapt into rhapsody of song.
My heart was very blithe and gay
To hail the promise of the day;
And I—oh, Lord !—am forty-one !
Strange I should love to see the sun,
Who such a crooked course have run !
Strange I, who turn so bald and grey,
Should thus exult to greet the day !
Ah, strange, most strange, to you and me,
Beset by these new things that be,
The spell of this old mystery!
And yet, however we are hurled
From pain to pain, from doubt to doubt,
We find it not at all worn-out,
This constant wonder of the world.


It almost seems to me (and you ?)
That dreams forgotten may come true
And faiths forsworn prove sound and wise,
Whene’er I see the sun arise.
And somehow then I feci its worth.
This trampled, sodden, scarred old clod ;
This fertile, futile, fat old earth
Seems still the masterwork of God.
And we are kings and princes then,
Breathing God’s breath, and strong in Him :
Not creatures strayed in some vague, dim
Morass of fear, but stalwart men
Who carry on from age to age
A goodly, spacious heritage.
I see the gods His kith stream forth
In glad battalions on the north
Wind; and I feel the warm caress
Of the grave, supple goddesses.
Demeter’s eyes glow in my blood,
And Hebe’s pleas can’t be withstood ;
And these suave heart-throbs are, I wis,
Indeed that dear rogue Venus’s.
And, with all these, I keep a tryst,
Full loyal (though the Greeks are there),
With that strong, timid, tender, fair,
Scarred superman, the Brother Christ.
His wounded hands are on my brow,
His bleeding side still bleeds for me ;
And somehow He forgives (somehow!)
My stubborn, mean contumacy.
Dear Brother of these brothers all,
That when I’m weakest staunchest stand


To succour me in case I fall—
When the first sunrays flood the land
And sea with glamours magical,
I dare to think You understand.
And at the last I dream I’ll be
One with your perfect Majesty :
Though Majesty is over-iced
To stir the soul. Be it confessed,
As man to Man I love You best,
0 gracious, comprehending Christ!
Lord! Lord!—What thoughts invade a man
Who can by any means contrive
To leave his bed ere it be five
And gaze again on Nature’s plan
So to redeem the time that flies
From stains of every sordid clan,
And bring man back to Paradise !
The sun is up. The day’s begun.
1 laugh at all my nightly fears ;
I care no whit for jars and jeers,
Nor for the crooked course I’ve run.
When this great spectacle is sent
To fill my soul with new content,
I’m piously impenitent.
I love you fondly, Royal Sun,
And —Lord ! —l’m well past forty-one !


BREAKFAST
A SUCCULENT pate, a bottle of wine,
Two shabby old plates, a cracked cup for the
drinking:
It doesn’t seem much, lissom lady o’ mine;
But we breakfasted nobly, I’m thinking.
A bare little room, two asthmatic old chairs,
And the town through our window just waking and
blinking:
A townful of makeshifts and tricks and despairs
And much miserly, sluggardly shrinking
From joys such as we knew (the claret was good),
While the sunlight streamed in on us gladly, unshrink-
ing
From your eyes that outshone it: in tune with our mood,
The garden-gods laughed with us, winking,
A wink’s a good thing when it’s winked in that way,
All dry-as-dust prudence and prejudice sinking;
So I pledge you now, dear, as I pledged you that day,
Though it’s wine of regret that I’m drinking.


LITTLE ONE
IF I should smile to see you weep,
You who have killed the soul of me,
’Twould be (since your dear heart’s asleep)
A wound to your dear vanity.
If I (poor fool) should ever dream
That for an hour you could be true,
How mad would such strange folly seem
To all the sober world and you !
If I should think that you could grieve
For any ill that you have done,
Or care one falsehood to retrieve,
How should I wrong you, little one !
If I should ever dare to pray
That when you’re old the deep offence
Of your unfaith might pass away,
How God would hate my insolence !
But I’ll not wish to see you weep.
However dead my soul may be;
Your heart unwounded you shall keep,
And still unscathed your vanity.


VILLANELLE
HER head upon my breast,
Her sweet deep eyes aglow,
She whispered, “ Love is best! ”
Pelf came, in purples drest.
She spurned him, laughing low,
Her head upon my breast.
Pale Pallas offered rest
And timorous joys; but no .. ,
She whispered, “ Love is best! ”
Death glanced our way. Distrest
Was I, she shuddering so,
Her head upon my breast.
Life flung forth hoards unguessed
Of gauds to tempt her. “ Oh,”
She whispered, “ Love is best! ”
Our eyes our faith confessed.
“ Dear, let the mad world go,”
Her head upon my breast,
She whispered, “ Love is best! ”


THE SOUL OF BABETTE
WITH all my heart,” she cried, “with all
My woman’s soul I love you, dear ! ”
Her voice was true and musical,
And, ah, her eyes were fond and clear.
“Dear lover, husband mine,” she sighed,
“ You are my world, my joy, my pain ! ”
I gazed on her with tender pride
And kissed her ready mouth again.
But straight she turned with laughter cold
And smeared our dearest shrine with dirt;
She bartered her red mouth for gold,
And pawned her honour for a skirt.
Yet, ah, her voice was musical,
The eyes I loved were soft and clear.
“ With all my heart,” she cried, “ with all
My woman’s soul I love you, dear! ”
46


HEALING
WHEN I am utterly alone.
And every cherished solace flies,
When this my heart is cold as stone
And dead within my bosom lies,
When I am sick of strife and lust
And all my dreams are dust of dust,
The night smiles with my Mother’s eyes.
When all my hopes have taken wing
And all my wounded faiths make moan,
When lurking sorrow’s bitter sting
Is anguish in my blood and bone,
When all my skies are overcast
An angel steals from out the past —
The sea’s voice is my Mother’s own.
When crippled Love sobs in my breast
And lowering Fear stands by to see,
When by black doubt I am oppressed
And by forlorn humanity,
A gracious Presence from the tomb
Comes softly to dispel my gloom—
Ah, dear dead hands that comfort me !


A BALLAD FOR HER
AH ! the delight of your dear eyes’ smiling
Wistfulness, Heart o’ Me !
How shall I praise your kind mouth’s beguiling
Tenderness, worthily ?
It is enough to be
Loved most sincerely where love’s sincerest.
Love has our souls in fee,
Dearest!
We give no harbour to doubts defiling,
Never a cloud we see.
Science may scold, but her harsh reviling
’S impious blasphemy.
Prudence—a cold jade, she !
Dogs all our steps, but brave Joy stands nearest,
Loveliest (you’ll agree)—
Dearest!
Busy to please us, Love’s hosts are filing
Still at our chains ; and he,
Lord of our dreams, from his store is piling
Fruits for our feast; so we—
We will not turn and flee
From his white shrine when his call is clearest . . .
Firm is our fealty,
Dearest!
48


ENVOY
Lady ! you hold the key
Of my delight; and grey Time, austerest
Dotard, ’s your co-trustee . . .
Dearest!
4


HONORIA
HONORIA, with the brows of snow,
The heart so crystal-cold, maybe
When I am where I needs must go
You’ll spare a passing thought for me.
A woman Nature made who seemed
The half divine ; and for the rest
Poor fools who loved her never dreamed
She hid an iceberg in her breast.
O, brow immaculately sweet!
O, perfect heart of virgin snow !
Honoria ! while I’m at your feet.
Forgive ; for I have loved you so !
Nay, you would weep to crush a fly,
And help a toad from out your path;
A passionate love’s iniquity
Is needed to arouse your wrath.
But when with age your form shall droop.
And all delights have passed away—
Remember then, you’d never stoop
To cheer a lover by the way !
50


And when your cup of years is full
And your last well-kept path you’ve trod,
You take your body beautiful
A wasted treasure back to God,
What will you plead for your misuse
Of God’s delights you so despise ?
What will you urge in your excuse,
Beneath the unfathomable eyes ?
What if the Highest, oriflammed
By souls redeemed and proven true,
Shall deem the veriest trull e’er damned
More faithful to her trust than you ?
Honoria, with the heart of snow,
The mind so crystal-cold, maybe
When I am where I needs must go
You’ll speak a prayer for me.
51
HONORIA


MOON AND SKY
THE stars are shining on the sea,
The sea is crooning to the night,
And Venus (as she smiles at me)
Is very wonderful and white.
Up there, a slender shape, the moon
Is dandled on the dark’s deep breast;
The dawn is coming very soon
To sweep the stars away to rest.
But you, my dear, who smile and sigh,
Perched thus demurely on my knee.
You are my moon and morning sky.
And wonderful enough for me.


THE HOPE
IF you should know,
When this my life is spent and all my dreams
Are dust of unremembered dust at last —
Should know how much I’ve loved you, dear, meseems
You’d weep for me ; and so
My soul should smile at all its sorrows past,
And all my atoms from the stream and sod
Should send a song triumphant up to God . . .
If you should know !
If we should meet
In some still valley past the brink of Time,
And gaze again into each other’s eyes
As once we gazed when joy was in its prime
And you still loved me, sweet —
Would you with me awake to Paradise
And bless the kind gods for their crowning grace
As our long-widowed lips clung fast a space,
If we should meet ?


THE LITTLE WOMAN
THERE is a little woman that I know.
Who is so
Exquisitely sweet and kind
That mere words can never tell
Half the graces that enthrone her in my mind:
And should I strive to speak
Even truths my pen can spell
Of her loyalty and grace,
I have neither time nor place,
All Eternity’s a week—
For the books that I should write
(Leaving precious things untold
Of that steadfast heart of gold)
Would be heaped above the suns
To Arcturus gleaming white
In the night
Should you know the smallest ones
Of her sweetnesses that hold me,
Of her smiles that purely glow
As they ’thrall me and enfold me,
You would say my heaven’s below,
On this weary scarred old earth,
Having barely glimpsed the worth
Of the tender little woman that I know !
There is a little woman that I prize.
For her eyes,


As they gentle me and cheer me down these ways
so weakly trod.
Are the evidence of Something dimly guessed,
Are the beacon-lights that lure me up to God;
So with her my heart finds rest
When the sordid grind and strife
And monotony of life
Half o’erwhelm me. . . • When sore pressed
By the vile relentless rout
Of the ghouls that gibe and flout,
It is good to turn for refuge to the lips that some-
how seem
To restore to hopes that flatter all the ecstasy of
dream,
It is good to turn for comfort to one’s wife.
Come what will of pain or sighs,
Let the truth be all confessed —
She is best.
This quiet little woman that I prize.


REQUIEM
Ci-git
Pierrette
TOLL out forlorn memoriam, heart o’ mine,
For all is said !
Weep for the vanished roses and the wine . . .
Pierrette is dead !
Her fondling hands lie very cold and still,
Her eyes are closed and those warm lips are chill,
I bleed alone that Death may have his will;
Delight is sped.
The shades crawl in upon me grim and slow;
The ghouls draw near. I heed them not; for, 10,
I cannot think, save that I loved her so . . .
Pierrette is dead !
Ah, flowers that loved her, grow more lovely o’er
That gracious head !
She was my flower, yet blooms she nevermore . . .
Pierrette is dead !
Her voice has stolen away upon the wind ;
Only her face shines passionate in my mind,
And in my heart, where she my saint lies shrined,
Dear memories tread
As though afraid to wake her where she sleeps.
Sad Joy, remembering, stands by her and weeps,
And Love grown old to kiss her cold feet creeps . . .
Pierrette is dead !


HEART-TALK
T AWOKE with a start, but the deep
1 Night was peace, the chaste moon shining
clear.
Then I knew what had broken my sleep . . .
’Twas my heart had cried out to you, dear.
’Mid the roar of the insolent street
My soul leapt to God, winging free.
God knows it had reason, my sweet;
For your heart must have whispered to me.
My blood sang elate to the sun,
And I laughed like a god in my pride,
When Death threatened; for then, little one,
Our hearts kissed each other and sighed.
And I know life’s high meaning is this
(So that finally all things come right):
I was born for and saved by your kiss,
When our hearts wept together that night 1


MY FAMILIAR
WHEN I am wearied half to death
With folks and other things that be,
When every hope is scant of breath
And sorrowful, there comes to me
At times a something that I know,
That cheers my soul and soothes my pain
And sets the ashen world aglow . . .
It’s my Familiar, back again.
It never definitely speaks,
And never tarries very long,
But in my tired old heart for weeks
I keep the solace of its song,
Despite my dearest friend and those
I love, my dearest enemies,
No one stands ever quite so close
As this my dear Familiar is.
With eyes invisible it smiles;
The music of its mute vague lips
Sustains me when grim Fate reviles
And every star seems near eclipse.
So does my heart fresh courage take,
For while I live and till I die,
Although the very heavens quake,
My dear Familiar’s standing by.


SLEEPING WATER
THE moon has set, and now the night
Croons softly to her stars that sigh
In sweetness myriad-fold, alight
In deep infinitudes of sky.
The breeze faints half to death ; the sea,
Where ancient furtive shadows creep,
Scarce stirring, slumbers murmurously,
While all the earth is sunk in sleep.
And on the vague dim water’s breast
That heaves in dreamings manifold
The stars are mirrored in unrest
Like shattered whispers wrought in gold.
The hills loom to the clouds, until
Their crests are lost; and in delight
That all the hordes of men arc still,
Grave trees are smiling in the night.
The moon has set, but in my heart
Her perfect glamour soothes and sighs,
And all the stars bear gracious part
In nature’s secret harmonies.
The sea is murmuring soft and low,
The hordes of men are fast asleep ;
And ah, the gods are calling so.
Spurring my soul from deep to deep !
59


TO CAMPASPE DYING
Cupid and my Campaspe played
At cards for kisses: Cupid paid. . . .
I LOVED you with a love that burned
With strong exultant breath,
A love that every barrier spurned
And shook my soul to death.
But soon you tore our lives apart
And blotted out my sky . . .
Yet . . .’tis sad pity, fickle heart,
That I should see you die!
For peering fools we’d little care . . .
God kissed us, you and me.
I loved you less for what you were
Than what you yet might be.
A helot tempted with a gaud.
And bought you with a lie.
But still . . . ’tis pity, winsome fraud,
That I should see you die!
Honour you held a foolish toy,
And truth a feckless wraith ;
You never knew the perfect joy
That springs from perfect faith.
I see your hands and lips defiled
By ordure of the sty . . .
And yet. . . ’tis pity, silly child,
That I should see you die !
60


Frail Circe of these ogling swine,
My Lady of the Stews,
Your thoughts no longer link with mine,
I loathe the beasts you use.
Ah, not for me the paths you tread.
Your nosing goats that spy . . .
And yet „ . . - ’tis pity, empty head,
That I should see you die !
But when you join your chosen damned
And bring new pains to Hell,
To those hosts grimly oriflammed
My story you shall tell.
Tell how you laughed to see me sink—
How (so forsaken, I!)
My heart broke utterly to think
That I should see you die.
61
TO CAHPASPE DYING


HER LOVE
IF it should prove
(I said) that soon
These cares should wear away your love
That blesses me, —
If it should prove that in the end
Love wanes as now that fickle moon,
And you should grudge the sweets you spend
So lavishly in my delight,—
Dear, if your eyes should see at last
The wastefulness
And folly of these good days past.
If you should count my gifts so slight
Against the graces you possess.
And so in doubting turn away
And leave me lone ;
If this befell.
Sweet, would you still.
When all my joy and hope had flown,
Think now and then, and think no ill.
Of me, whom once you loved so well ?
If I should cease
(She said) from loving you,
Then Love himself would be a knave forsworn.
And there would be no sweetness in the morn,
No promise in dusk evening’s quiet sky,—


If I should cease from loving you, my heart
Would be a sorry place of pest and shame.
And I should stand contemned, a thing apart,
Unworthy of the heritage and name
Of womankind ; —dear, hold your soul in peace,
Clean paths or miry ways, dark skies or blue,
Let come what may, I must at least be true
She said no more,
For laughing down the ways
Another came with all youth’s fires ablaze
(My youth, alas ! was falling to eclipse);—
She ran to clasp him, yielding him her store '
Of what was mine a little while before,
And I, with sudden sorrow and amaze,
Stood dying as she hung upon his lips.


INVOCATION
. . . Les miettes de notre table,
Nous les gardens pour nos chiens.
Va ehez le voisin, bon pauvre.
Car, chez nous, tu n’auras rien.
MY dearest dream sobs to the moon
Disconsolate, my stars have set,
And I’ll have done with living soon ;
So you’ll sigh once, maybe, Pierrette.
Your mouth is exquisite to kiss,
Your heart is populous ; but yet
At moments even me you’ll miss.
And pout at destiny, Pierrette.
Your fragile hand to wound is strong,
But tender when you choose. I’ll let
It go at that. . . . Your life’s a song
Sounds sometimes rather cracked, Pierrette I
But when I sink beneath that sea,
If God should pity and forget,
I’ll pray : “In each eternity
Give me five minutes with Pierrette! ”
64


AFTER ?
WHEN I am dead, and all the things
I’ve dreamed are dust of yesterday,
When I sleep with the clowns and kings
Beyond life’s immemorial springs,
I wonder now—What will folks say ?
They’ll shrug derisive shoulders, they
Who knew me least, and with a frown
Sneer, “ He was very common clay,
A vicious fool in every way,
The sorriest ass in all the town.”
The prudes will scream, “ Such his renown
For impious jest abhorred and vain,
That Virtue drew aside her gown
To see him pass, and cried adown
The breeze her infinite disdain.”
The moralists will croak, “ With pain
We heard his words as he would tell
All men from prudence to refrain
And scorn all law. He was, for gain,
A glib ambassador of Hell.”
But you, dear love, you know me well,
And you will weep my soul unshriven.
And say, “ Still fighting shame, he fell.
His conscience was his citadel.
He loved much. Now he is forgiven.”


HIS WEALTH
WHAT though my heart grows old, so old,
The while the grinding seasons roll,
I have in keeping wealth untold
To make a pleasance for my soul.
The perfect pearls of dawn are mine,
And mine the fierce glad noonday’s light.
Why should I murmur or repine,
Who own the jewels of the night ?
The leaping seas that gird the globe
With thunderous splendours all the year
Were made for me, for me the robe
Of pure delight when Spring is here.
And everything that lives and glows
With passion, lives and glows in me :
Mine the ripe rapture of the rose,
The daisy’s chaste simplicity.
Whene’er a dimpling babe is kissed,
The kiss runs whispering through my blood ;
I clasp all joys mean fools have missed,
And laugh to find each joy so good.


The life of puny crawling things
Is of my life a perfect part:
The tiniest creature’s flickering wings
Beat gracious music in my heart.
I bless the gods that give me joy;
And when their wisdom sends me pain,
I, who have Circumstance for toy,
Do bless the gracious gods again.
So every cup my lips must drain
I drain contented : knowing this—
That in the cups abrim with pain
A secret excellence there is.
Life offers countless gifts to me,
And I’ll not meanly turn from these
Because afar my fears can see
The gibbering vile Eumenides.
O, Love, my lord, I’m growing old,
But still thy golden chariots roll:
I bless thee for thy manifold
Great gifts, High Monarch of my Soul!


NIGHT AND JOY
Oiseau bleu, couleur du temps,
Ou te caches-tu, rebelle ?
Oh ! vole a moi: je t’attends !
Joseph Boulmikr.
WELL knowing that the dame I love
Is very fair to see,
My joy is greatest when I know
That as she moves amid this show
And others find her fair enough
She’s fairer still to me.
Her eyes are sometimes grave and deep,
And sometimes sweet and kind.
Within their depths such ardours sleep
As spur my constant mind.
At night, with languorous glows astir,
They’re music in my blood;
But morning finds those eyes of her
Less easily withstood.
With kisses exquisitely keen
Her mouth is treasure-trove ;
For every kiss is fraught, I ween,
With all the world of love.
68


(The night is rich with stars that sing
Until the planets ache
With very stress of joy to find.
As lovers’ sighs go down the wind,
Love is so sweet a thing.)
Her dimples, filched from Venus’ zone,
Croon to my heart and cry.
The stars go shuddering down the night
To sec her dimpled waist so white;
And tender maidens when they wake
Blush coyly still for love’s dear sake,
Yet scarcely can tell why.
But, ah, my lady is to me
So generous, I know
Just why the stars that stoop to see
Her lips should shudder so !
I, knowing that the dame I love
Is very fair to see,
One bliss incomparable know—
That, as she moves amid this show
And others find her fair enough,
She’s fairest still to me !


THE QUEST
“ this be love ?” I cried; and so with strong,
Glad, passionate hands clasped her and held her
fast;
But found dead bones within my arms ere long,
And knew her for damnation at the last.
“ Can this be love ? ” I said, and bent my head
To reap the harvest of her lips, and find
The secret long elusive; but she fled,
And Hell was vocal in the clamorous wind.
“ Can this be love ? ” I whispered, and her eyes
Smiled softly on me, and her pure proud face
Was gracious, and her lips were Paradise.
She faded, and night closed upon that place.
A tremor unfamiliar stirs my blood,
Born now of radiance in the skies above.
I only know that life is strangely good
And sweet, and She is here. . . . Can this be love !


A NIGHT PIECE
HE Moon against my window beats and beams
And croons and sighs ;
But mightier, lordlier, spurring all my dreams.
Across the deeps great Sirius flames afar.
Lord paramount of all these nearer skies—
These homely skies that are a dust of gold.
The night is vast,
And ah, my dreams are bold
Now, by day’s limitations uncontrolled,
My hopes no longer dwarfed and overcast,
By day’s dull reek of miseries manifold !
Day’s noises past.
The night is grave, inscrutable, and grey,
The night is golden, exquisite, and deep,
The silent comforter of those that weep,
Incomparably grander than the day,
Immense and cold.
Across the deeps great Sirius flames afar
And warms my heart, and makes it plain to me
How small a corner of Infinity
We call Creation; so that in my dreams,
All careless of the smug contemptuous Moon
And of the sceptic Day that comes so soon,


I feel and know
That past the point where Sirius flames, afar
There is a region where the old suns are,
Where all things live in happy union, though
Tremendous space begirds them, each demesne
A point apart ’mid measureless vagues serene—
A million million leagues from star to star.
The Moon against my window beats and beams
And croons and sighs ;
But mightier, lordlier, spurring all my dreams.
Across the deeps great Sirius flames afar,
Lord Paramount of all these nearer skies.
There is a region where the old suns are . . .
The nearer heavens are a dust of gold.


AT FORTY
SWIFT into limbo Youth’s vain dreams go —
Scatter-brained, trumpery, chaste, or tender;
Penitence burns to revolt, and so
Prudence derides the poor gifts we send her.
Twenty’s the age when the wild young fellows
Breed the doomed hopes that the next years slay.
Thirty scowls back, of Youth’s madness jealous . . .
Lord ! and I’m forty years old to-day!
Ten years ago I was blithe and gay . . .
Queer ! but to-day I’m just ten years gayer.
Time is a brother, let jibe who may,
Brother and comrade and dragon-slayer!
June has gone by, well ahead’s October;
Still in these shadows lithe dryads stray.
Here is no time to be grave and sober,
Boys, for I’m forty years old to-day!
Here on this threshold kind Earth stands smiling,
Bearing a burden of gifts for me :
Gracious old Earth, with deep eyes beguiling,—
Breasts of delight that no striplings see.
Life laughs aloud to us, calling, calling,
(Death’s very busy across the way)—
Life is worth while when one’s hair is falling,
Dear, and I’m forty years old to-day !


Fifty Years, over the hill up yonder,
Waits, with a song or a sword maybe;
Shall I pass by him and smile, I wonder.
Or will he never have sight o’ me ?
One’s getting stiffcr with each grey dawning,
There’s an account I shall have to pay . . .
Ah, but our sun’s very bright this morning,
Love, and I’m forty years old to-day!


SUMMER SONG
OLOVE, that sold my heart to Death,
The lark is in the sky,
The earth with deep exultant breath
Laughs to the hours that fly.
Almost to-day I can forget what you are now to me,
For pity of the preciousness that once you seemed to be !
The trees have donned their summer sheen.
The grass is cool and sweet;
Frail flowers of beauty hide between
The springing stems of wheat.
Ah, almost on this day of days some comfort I can win,
Though I was fond and trusted you, and you were false
as sin.
0 Love, that flung my soul to death
And blotted out my sky,
The earth with every deep-drawn breath
Mocks my dear dreams that fly.
The day is gold, but well I know, however gold it be,
My heart is ice for evermore, now you have murdered me!


A BALLAD OF DOWNHILL
GLAD am I when my lady pleases,
Still can I laugh at her blithe command,
Though, when the grip of the dull years seizes,
Death and the Devil seem close at hand.
Ugh ! but the shingles are sharp on the strand,
Cutting the feet of a limping fellow;
Zest of high living at last is banned . . .
Now for the time of the sere and yellow !
Where the sun kissed us the blizzard freezes,
Those brave adventures so long we’ve planned
Must be abandoned; with senile wheezes,
Grimly we trudge through a hostile land.
Never again will our hopes be fanned
To an exuberance bland and mellow.
Fingers clutch wildly at ropes of sand . . .
Now for the time of the sere and yellow!
Gaspings and gropings and coughs and sneezes . . .
God ! at the best we are half unmanned.
Dead as vile Haman our old-time ease is,
Shaky the ground where we shrink and stand.
Cherished illusions are contraband.
Harpies are keening and vampires bellow.
Life has gone past us (you’ll understand) . . .
Now for the time of the sere and yellow !


l’envoy
Death ! ere the hosts of our youth disband
And your sharp teeth snap and crunch us, tell—-oh
Tell us !—What dole will the gods demand
Now, for the time of the sere and yellow ?


VŒU D’AMOUR
AH, dear, could I forget ?—forget the form
Of delicate cloudlets winging to the south,
Your kisses cool upon my eyes, and warm
As Love’s own breath your kisses on my mouth 1
The great ineffable stars that watched, and knew
How blest we were, then paled before the dawn !
The lordly gracious Sun whose heralds flew
To name him King, as night’s hosts were withdrawn!
Your eyes, whence ecstasy had banished tears.
Were heavy with infinitude of bliss,
And God was lonely ’mid His measureless years
As all creation trembled to your kiss.
The old hills rocked with rapture, and the sweet
Deep pleasant places of the world sang low,
As all my heart lay vanquished at your feet.
And all my soul was proud to love you so.
Your mouth was odorous of the East, and filled
With every exquisite tremor Love has known
Since first shy fear on Psyche’s lips was killed
And her white citadel was overthrown.


Can I forget, my dearest one ? —forget
The cloudlets soft that sighed towards the south,
Your eyes that glowed, the stars that crooned and set,
And all the morning glory of your mouth !
When I forget, I pray that God may smite
My manhood into ruin, and may set
My soul adrift and lonely in the night
Where dreams are agonies. . . . When I forget!


SONG
ACROSS the deserts lone and chill
Of my dead heart there comes a cry
All resolute with hope, until
I dream of solace by and by.
Above the desolate ice a sigh
Of tropic sweetness steals and glows,
A something pure as modesty
Yet warm as some resplendent rose.
My weary heart that broke and froze
May hope again, until . . . until! . . .
Ah, dear faint thing that comes and goes
Across the deserts lone and chill!


THE ROOM
A MEAN little room, very small, very bare
(But you can’t cramp Felicity . . . double),
And narrow the grave (could Felicity care !)
Where we buried our fears and our trouble.
The suave Southern night and the stars, the dear stars,
Peered in on our kisses and laughter;
(“ Let ’em love while they can, dear,” to Venus said Mars ;
“To the deuce and the dogs the day after! ”)
Said Venus, “ The girl has a mouth, such a mouth
That I’d pawn my own girdle to kiss it;
But I fear that so fierce and so keen is his drouth,
If I took but one sip he would miss it! ”)
Oh, love of my life, love o’ mine, my dead love,
Leaping blood, dance o’ death ! . . . would you sorrow
If God the All-Pitiful waking above
Flung us back to each other to-morrow ?
Oh, wantonness exquisite, kindness unchaste,
Dear falsehood made perfect in sweetness,
Would you kneel at that altar (so vilely debased)
If it rose once again in completeness ?


Would you kneel, would you care, would you worship
again
As you worshipped when life was worth living ?
Could those hands once so tender bring balm for my
pain ?
Could I kiss them, forgetting, forgiving ?
The mean little room, and the dear little girl,
And the stars that with rapture were sighing,
The ecstasies breathless all leaping awhirl,
And the pale shred of moon slowly dying ! . . .
The infinite night was our chambermaid then,
And the Pleiades warmly were crooning
A lullaby meet for our sleeplessness when
Proud Artemis sighed to her swooning! . . .
Oh, love lapt in shame, love o’ mine, my lost love,
Blood afire, fire o’ blood ! . . . would you sorrow
Were I plucked a sad brand by dear God up above
From the burning that damns me, to-morrow ?


IN GRAVER MOOD




JUDAS
WITH sleek soft restless hands, quick shifty eyes
Alert and superficially kind,
With pilfered quips and gestures forced and
strained,
Mendacity disguised as honest zeal,
Vile offal tricked out as the food of gods,
Self-scheming masked to ape benevolence,
A traitor to the marrow, but of his tongue
A very model of good-fellowship,
Judas among the people filched his way,
For ever dreaming of the price of blood.
He would, sirs, be as brave a gentleman
As any old Judaea ever spawned.
He marked the mien and speech of men whose charm
Made them the masters of their time and place.
He fawned upon the cheap and easy fair,
Taught silly girls the posturing of the stews,
And whispered honey in the ear of trulls
When honest women would have none of him.
He would, just Heaven ! be a man of mark,
This gibbering pantaloon and graceless dolt,
This impious charlatan too vile and mean
For crows to drop their dung on, this cheap thing.
This would-be wit who was at best buffoon.
Low-browed he was ; his every lowering look


And sidling motion branded him a boor;
But he, egad, would turn a leg in town,
Would tread a measure at fastidious routs
And sit at meat with princes ! His attempt,
Foredoomed to infamous failure, cost him gold,
And never a paltrier varlet skulked obscure
Than he. For pelf he would have sold his soul;
But no base ghoul of the obscenest deep
Was so put to’t for prey that he would waste
Upon a thing so nauseous half a groat.
So Judas slunk in darkness through the town,
Nosing for offal, snatched the beggar’s dole,
And plundered outcasts’ houses. He would lie
A million lies and thrice a million, such
As Satan must have shuddered at, to gain
The wherewithal to blot a public way
With his detested presence. But with that
He was a very perfect hypocrite,
And his behaviour passed unnoticed, save
By such as stood too high to stoop so low
As dower him with a passing favour of
Their grave contempt. He lived for all the world
Of fools and dupes a sober man and chaste;
Though all the world, even of fools and dupes.
Laughed at his queer contortions and his scheme
To be a somebody in open day.
Then One came to the land, and when He came
All men knew well here was at least a Man.
His name was on the lips of simple folk,
White virgins breathed it on their bridal eves,
Men dying spoke it and so died in peace:
An honoured name, though cold marauders shrieked
Their hatred of the name, though pads and bawds


Spat at the name, though knaves that lashed the crowd
That writhed and crawled looked lowering at the Man
And deemed him ripe for judgment.
Judas marked
The Man’s strange coming, and he straightway saw
That here mayhap might be the chance he lacked
To be a somebody in open day
And have the wherewithal to boast at night
Of what he was and would be. So to that
Great Stranger Judas went with eyes cast down.
And cringed in the high presence of the Man,
And offered service. Then the Stranger gazed
Upon the hypocrite and pitied him
The while He hated his hypocrisy.
So Judas was made scavenger of those
That stood the nearest to the Man and owned
His splendid majesty and sovereign power.
It was ordained. Judas could never be
A friend to any man. Judas must seek
To overthrow his friend, as naturally
As parched, starved beasts seek water. Judas sought
Straightway how best he might betray the Man
For his own profit. So he went by night
And sold his Master in the public stews.
It was a matter easy to arrange,
Given a traitor vile enough. ’Twas planned
He should do this, and this ,* and so, and soon
The greatest One in all the land should die ;
And Judas, he should have the wherewithal
To be a somebody in open day
And work out his damnation as he chose.
By devious ways he so bestowed a kiss


It seemed his Master must be trapped and slain
And utterly overthrown. And Judas took
The price the Devil flung him, and went forth
To mix with such Judaean gentlemen
As had strong stomachs and would sit with him.
Judas went forth. But in his venomous heart
The grim fear sat slow-snarling, and anon
A voice unknown cried shrill, “ Thou sorry knave ! ”
The night was hateful with a myriad eyes
That glared contempt upon him. Every breeze
Shrieked maledictions. Something decent stirred
Within the knave, and such was his alarm
That this strange thing should move in him, who would
Be a glad blade and royster with the best,
That he fled puling to an honest tree,
And hanged himself in terror.
Now in Hell
The meanest ghouls avoid him, and the damned,
Who sigh in sorrow for each other’s pains,
All flee at his approach.
So ends his tale.


A THOUGHT
THE rivers roll unthinking to the sea ;
The mountains stand serene and make no fuss.
There is a something in the tiniest tree
Magnificently calm, rebuking us,
Poor creatures of a day, who probe and peer,
For ever questioning of How and Why,
Who miss the sweetness of the changing year
And dwarf creation to our common sty.
The naked flowers are glad and unashamed,
All reckless of our paltry May and Must.
Before we were, majestic Sirius flamed,
And still will flame when all our dreams are dust.
A myriad suns are radiant in space;
Ten million suns have burned their day, and ceased.
We are the flies that speck a little place ;
Of all the things that are, we matter least.


THE STRANGERS
THERE are strangers in the street,
And their cold
Glances stab me as they pass me, and the sweet
Little stories that my heart knows are untold
To these strangers that I meet
Ever peering in the street,
Whose dull footfalls beat and beat
On my heart that would enfold
Every creature that I see—
This deep-yearning heart of me
That has known all mystery
And is old.
There are ladies in the street,
Some upholstered all awry,
Some that pass on dancing feet
Though their souls are hard and dry ;
Sadly torn and incomplete
Are my dreams that soared so high,
As they stare and pass me by,
These strange ladies in the street,
These frail moths that brush their wings
Past the foetid nameless things
In the very mouth of Hell,
And who sell
All the preciousness of youth,


All its honour and its ruth,
For one hour of swift forgetting in the street.
In the street lost brothers roam
Here and there.
And I know them when we meet
Mid the turmoil of the street,
And our eyes cling close in passing while our mute lips
breathe a prayer
That the gods may give us speedy passage home
To the silence that awaits us when our last grim march
is past,
To the darkness that shall clothe us with oblivion at last—
To the long, long sleep of comfort at the last.


THE MAN BY HIMSELF
I KNOW a man who lives by himself
While the fools and the folks pass by.
He’s hungry, but just out of reach on the shelf
Are the cates he would like to try.
At a pinch, there is no one to give him cheer
Or lend him a helping hand ;
So he doesn’t have quite the good time down here
That he’d like to, you understand.
He grins like a Spartan and fights like a Turk
As the best of his days slip by,
He’s bound to the wheel of discomfort and work . . .
Heaven help me ! that man is I.
There’s many a fellow who lives by himself
Far out of the sight and sound
Of the fakers of morals and seekers of pelf
As the weary old earth drags round.
Their hopes and ambitions are going to waste —
Ay, even the oats they sow.
They see all the best of the game, but they’re placed
Outside of the goodly show.
There’s one that I know very well, and it seems
That his luck has gone all awry.
For he’s robbed of his birthright and torn from his
dreams . . .
God save me ! that man is I.


There are risks to be run when one lives by himself.
For devils malign and sly,
With many a lithe and seductive elf,
Sneak in or go whispering by.
Their voices are suave as they point the way
To a softer perdition than this,
Where fruits now and then may be plucked on a day
And damnation be sweetened with bliss.
There’s a man often tempted to hate, and worse,
The traitors who creep and buy
His soul for the worms ere he goes to the hearse . . .
Christ guard me ! that man is I,


NOCTURNE
THE hills are black against the setting moon,
And from the grim black hills a harsh wind skirls
And screams across the city like a ghoul,
Tearing the clouds to tatters as it goes
And scooping up the harbour till the waves
Fret and complain against the clustered piles
Of these old wharves. That ’plaining gnaws the ear
And half o’ercomes the wind that shrieks and cries—
That whimpering of torn waters. Far away,
A solitary lighthouse blinks and peers
Through a thin smoke of rain ; while near at hand,
Almost against my feet, a human blur,
God’s image huddled into shapelessness,
A drunken tramp lies prone against a heap
Of trash and lumber. From the vast o’erhead,
Swept clean of tattered clouds, great Sirius flames
In scorn superb of all the worlds between
And all the myriad things that live and breed
On matter rotting to its final end. . . .
The sodden creature shudders there and moans.
While as it creeps about his infamous rags
The wind, as though remorseful, sobs and sighs
And trembles into quiet. God alone
Knows why such wrecks should share His ancient night,
And God is silent, weeping. ... To the left,
An arc-lamp swings and flaunts its puny flare


Against the splendour of the unnumbered stars,
While underneath the lamp a maudlin fool
Claws up the gangway to a ship that lies
A-waiting to be off across the world,
Condemned to carry such poor maudlin fools
As lice are carried by Leviathan. . . .
The night is full of mean and sordid things ;
But still the wind roars its triumphant song,
And still great Sirius, infinitely proud,
Beams up above like some transcendent pearl
Set on the bosom of Immensity.


SONG OF THE PEOPLE
WE are the People omniscient! —at word of our might
Mountains fall riven to dust,
Or the shuddering night,
Scared by our wrath into horror of gasping affright,
Bursts into rivers of blood, while Oppression and Lust
Flee to their burrows in fear, and with crawling disgust
Curse us and die !
We build our gallows on hilltop and plain, and near by
Tyrants crouch watching our beacons that blaze up on
high,
Jewelling minster and steeple !
Terrible, beautiful, strong in the truth that we cry,
We are the People !
We are the People All-Loving !—we reckon aright
Gibes of the insolent rich and the piteous cry
Wrung from the breasts of frail babes as they hunger and
die! —
We scorn the gods that they trust—
Pander and dotard and vampire and minion and wanton
bedight
Still with the gems that we dig for and bleed for—and
bright,
Bright as the flame of our scorn, is the hope we espy;—
Soon all the barbarous wrongs that now fester and creep ’ll
Rot, and as carrion lie !


We are the Lords of the Time; kings may squirm, but
they must
Bend as whipped thralls to the gods we have made, by
and by .. .
We are the People !
We are the People Uniting !—we fling to the sky
Challenges fierce as we waken and leap from the dust!—
We toss aside pale You may for terrific You must :
Splendid and piercing and fierce is our ultimate cry!—
Soon the starved helots that suffer and struggle and weep ’ll
Spring fully armed to the glorious banner we fly!—
Out on you, tyrannous horde ! for the battle you fight
Ends in damnation for you now our torch is alight!—
Out and to hell with you ! prelate and courtier and spy,
Fools that have trusted in fools and have built on a lie !
We are the People !
We are the People Unsparing ! —your doom is anigh !
Law-cats and snufflers and pilferers greedy and sly!—
We shall live fatly in peace while you munch on a crust
Flung by our pity that you shall have leisure to die !
Red glooms the sun of our rising, our mandate is thrust
Into your womanish hands that so tremble with fright!—
Back to your owner and master, vile owls of the night!—
Torments you’ve made, at your livers shall batten and
bite;
Pits you have digged for our feet, so grim-yawning and
deep, ’ll
Serve to hide your foetid clay from our noses and sight!—
We are the People !


MY LADY WAITS
BEYOND these steps up which we storm and
sweat
In ragged and irregular advance,
Beyond these swamps of mercenary chance,
Beyond these arid wastes with pitfalls set,
Beyond the ceaseless clamour and the fret
Of this forlorn endeavour, foolish strife,
And grim monotony that fools call Life,
She waits, my Lady, patient and most sweet,
Her grey robes trailing grandly to her feet,
Eternal mists about her regal head,
Eternal mystery potent in her breath,
She waits to soothe me, whose last joy has fled,
With splendid promise in her gracious face,
She waits to bear me to her secret place . . .
My Lady Death.
My stricken heart at times can hear her sigh,
And sometimes catch, afar, or nearer by,
The crooning solace of her lullaby.
Fair, oh, so fair she is, and sweet, so sweet.
And gentle as the glamour of the moon,
So that my heart is fain to clasp her soon,
To kiss her cool strong hands, her silent feet,
The while my raptured senses burn and swoon.


Adown the way are crosses stark and lone
On which my martyred hopes were crucified ;
But she, my waiting Lady and my Bride,
Will fill my soul with comfort, and atone
For my dead faiths that blessed her as they died,
And I shall drink oblivion at her side
And leave the foul old earth to crawl and moan
From whimpering dawn to mouldering eventide,
Leave its pale joy that wilts so soon and fades.
Its carping hucksters and its barren jades,
Its gods of clay and smokedrift, dross and stone,
And I shall stand with her, we two alone,
And clasp her close as I pass through the gates
Where, pining for me now, my Lady waits . . ,
Then, as the ages pass into the dust
Of unremembered aeons, I shall know
Surcease of strife and trouble, fear and lust,
And I shall taste, soft-pillowed on her breast,
The full beatitude of perfect rest,
And I shall drink her tears and breathe her breath,
And through my dreams her exquisite voice will flow
In murmured benedictions soft and low
What time she stoops above me . . . gentle Death!
With splendid promise in her gracious face,
She waits to bear me to her secret place . . .
She waits, my Lady, resolute and sweet,
Her grey robes trailing to her gracious feet,
Eternal mystery potent in her breath . . .
My Lady Death!


THE BELOVED
UNTO the judgment-seat of God
A soul came simpering, sleek and prim.
On earth a smooth, cramped path he’d trod,
And slander could not prey on him.
His little morals, mean and white,
Were all unsmirched by flagrant sin;
He’d lived secluded day and night,
Far from the harsh world’s cark and din.
And God cried: “You are well content
And confident, my man, I see.
The soul I fashioned fair and lent
To you, comes shrivelled back to me.”
“ Lord,” smirked the soul, “ it is, I ween,
A soul as pure as it was when
I had it from Thy hand. It’s been
Kept from the taint of common men.
“ All sins of sense I have disdained,
Nor tempted been by leaping lust.
From all transgression I’ve abstained
I have, I think, fulfilled my trust.


“ I’ve lived with caution, scorning all
The hateful lures of which men tell.
I’m neither rake nor prodigal,
But seemly and respectable.”
But God spake : “ All untouched you bring
From that My world’s stern work and strife
The soul I made a lordly thing
To spur you when I gave you life 1
“ You’ve stuck it in a sordid clod,
You’ve built it from the sun with wood;
What are you, who thus deem that God
Prefers a man withouten blood ?
“ You’ve grinned secure where Mine own men
’Mid sin and sorrow fought and fell—
You toad in ermine ! Get you then
Now to pollute My neighbour’s hell! ”
The soul slunk forth. I heard it moan.
And next came proudly, stained and scarred,
A soul that stood before the throne
Erect and stalwart, breathing hard.
And God laughed. “ Brother mine, I wis,
Ye’ve fought the fight and dared the death.
Ye’ve lived to shame mine enemies,
And never drawn a caitiff breath.”
The soul cried out: “ Despite Thy will,
I’ve lived a sinful man, O God,
The good I’ve planned has turned to ill.
lam abased. Spare not Thy rod !


“ Not faithful, I. My cursed pride
The soul I bring has stained with lust—
This soul of mine for which Christ died,
In Whose high death I dare not trust!
“ I’ve lived a selfish beast and blind ;
And I could weep to have lived so,
In pity for poor humankind
I might have succoured there below.
“ I owe thee wife and children dear;
But others, fallen by the way,
I have not loved enough ; so here,
O God, lam abased, I say! ”
God stooped and kissed him on the brow.
Amazed, he lay on God’s deep breast.
The angels whispered gladly, “ Now
He giveth His beloved rest! ”


THE DRAUGHT
I WAS athirst, till God, Who knew,
Held His gold cup to my sad mouth.
And gladness thrilled my being through
At such assuagement of my drouth.
I said, “ My soul is at Thy feet
For this divinest gift of Thine ! ”
I clasped the cup of promise sweet,
Then turned away. . . . The draught was brine.
I would have chidden, and turned round,
My cup of anguish brimming full;
And then before mine eyes I found
The grinning sockets of a skull.


IN THE CELL
I, WHO have walked in purple, don the grey
And set aside the cup that I have quaffed
Oft to my soul’s undoing. Comes the day
When I must bear the cross—when I, who’ve
laughed
With joy and hope and drawn no niggard breath.
Must walk close-wed with anguish to the death !
0 chill grey garb, my refuge and my shroud,
In thee at least is safety, and in thee
Is sure escape from the marauding crowd
That still would persecute and pillage me !
Dull folds of grey about my body stark,
Grim presage of the morrow and the dark !
My heart that burned is set about with ice.
My eyes that shone are blinded with my tears;
No saving virtue, no redeeming vice.
Shall stir the ashes of these coming years.
To-day dies sadly in this waning light:
For me henceforth ’tis all To-night . . . To-night!
I, who have laughed, sit weeping. I, who know
How sweet and very sweet is life, must sink,
Though dead still living, through unending woe
Until I reach at last the awful brink
Where prison ends, and darkness, like a pall,
Falls on the spirit grimly, closing all.


QUIPS AND TRIFLES




RUS IN URBE
THERE never was another girl, I think,
So finely fitted for each moment’s uses
As you, my dear. What shall we have to drink ?
Come! I’ll take no denials or excuses.
It must be wine to-night; because, you see,
To-night we’re out of touch with care and sorrow.
The night is gold, and you are kind to me ;
. We’ll pledge in wine our possible to-morrow.
Then, should to-morrow come and find me lone.
I’ll have at least the memory of this drinking
To keep me glad. One joy I shall have known :
Our eyes have met and spoken, yours unshrinking !
They’re deep and excellent, you know, your eyes,
Tender and grave; your mouth, too, ’s wondrous
winning.
To do the right thing still a fellow tries,
But if I kissed you it could scarce be sinning.
This wine’s aglow with kisses, and the sun
Of your clear presence warms a weary sinner;—
What better solace when the day is done
Than just the girl to suit one—and the dinner ?


Let’s go and call a cab, dear child ; that is
The thing to do, when Fate is so propitious.
(I say, your mouth’s a flower, a fleur de lys ;
Your profile’s most appealingly delicious.)
A hansom cab’s a cosy car of bliss,
When those within it are so sweetly mated.
The god within the car is needed : his
It is to keep bliss pure and joy unsated.
That is, I know, a trifle trite; but I
Have inexpressive moments when sincercst , . .
I love you most when you’re so proud and shy . . .
Ah, but I thought at last you would, dear . . . dearest!
So we escape for yet a little while
From all the sordid crowd that would encage us ! . . .
Dear, did you notice that old cabby’s smile ?
Delight like ours is just a shade contagious.
I like this room of yours. It stands above
The city’s noise and squalor, and its quiet
Comforts and soothes. I’m very much in love
With peace, and much abhor all sordid riot.
The scent of flowers on your window-sill
Whispers of rural gardens prim and olden.
The growing wheat’s delicious, dear; but still
Your hair is of a more entrancing golden.
Your mouth (let’s mix the simile) ’s a rose
That breathes of milk and honey, curds and—this is
The strangest blend !—red clover buds ; and, oh,
Your mouth’s exultant, clamouring for kisses !


Your eyes—now, how can one describe your eyes ?
Twin violets touched with dews of earliest dawning—
So blue, so blue ; and in their sweetness lies
A promise—but I’ll tell you in the morning.
No morning-glows, dear, can outshine your eyes.
But natural lights may show them more alluring . . .
The last tram’s gone ? Lord ! how the glad time flies !
But memory’s still incomparably enduring.
When I am old I shall recall to-night
(You never will be old, but you’ll remember),
And I shall laugh aloud in Time’s despite ;
The thought of you will fan the fading ember.
Then from the scattered ashes of my dreams
Your face will shine, with tears and rapture in it,
And I shall love you utterly ; though it seems
I could not love you better than this minute.
Here, while your cheek is warm against my cheek,
The very thought of age seems half disloyal
To you. You know, this week’s a purple week,
And I, your lover, stand aloof and royal
Above the crowded heads of meaner men
Who pinch and steal and grind and beg and borrow ...
That’s Two ! Ten minutes since ’twas half-past ten,
And I was darkly talking of to-morrow.
And now to-morrow’s come, and is to-day—
To - night! —To - night! Ah, dear, your eyes are
splendid.
In this soft glow—a golden soothed to grey,
Like the cool West when all the sunset’s ended.


This trick of similes and comparisons
Holds me, you see ; but you’ll forgive that, knowing
How habit still enslaves old Adam’s sons,
Mid wintry blasts or when Spring’s winds are blowing.
For me, I only know that for to-day
I have and hold you, utterly and sweetly !
It’s passing strange. What is your secret way,
Thus to bewitch one at a glance, completely ?
Sleep ? Yes ; but I shall know you very near;
The knowledge will emparadise my dreaming.
I am your sultan and your slave, old dear 1
I am . . . The rain is down your window streaming,—
I, —Lord ! I’m comfortable as can be ;
I’d not change places with the Tsar or Kaiser.
There’s Venus peeping through a cloud-rift. . . . See ?
Don’t hide your face,child. We cannot surprise her.
She’s watched a myriad loves, that lady there. . . .
Tired out ? Not she ! You mean, am I tired ? Fairly.
But there’s no fellow happier anywhere.
Good-night! . . . We two shall face the dawning
squarely.
There never was another girl, I think,
So Poor old kid ! how soundly she is sleeping 1
And Venus, that white rascal, seems to wink ;
And on soft feet Dame Hushaby comes creeping.


IF I DIED . . .
IF I died for love of you,
Would you sorrow, gracious lady ?
Would you be my mourner true,
If I died for love of you ?
Other swains would come to woo,
Whisp’ring ’mid the coverts shady . . .
If I died for love of you,
Would you sorrow, gracious lady ?


THE STROLLER
/"DUNG Love comes lilting down the street,
X Beribboned cap and sprig of heather ;
And, oh, his smile and song are sweet,
To suit the golden weather.
The staid prim spinsters starched and old
Glance out of window as he passes,
And something from his eyes of gold
Steals in behind their glasses ;
While city men, all shrewd and grim,
With thin tight lips and paunch obtrusive,
Half smile, and try to catch from him
That melody elusive.
And dainty schoolgirls cease from play,
Eyes lowered, as he passes near them ...
Ah, if they could but dare to pray!
Ah, should he deign to hear them!
But you and I, my heart, my heart,
Love Love as Love loves us, and surely
He would not have us stand apart
And bow to him demurely !


We kiss his lips and gladly prove
How brave the gifts he can bestow. It
Is good to be in love with Love,
And good to let him know it.
Boy Love comes laughing down the street,
Love and my dear and I together;
And, oh, his songs are blithe and sweet,
To suit this golden weather !

DE VITA BEATA
For Bob Barr
TIME was, dear Bob, when you and I
Laughed as the lilting days went by,
And blessed with every raptured sense
The gods’ benign munificence.
Those times are dead, and (mark the point)
These times seem sadly out of joint.
The world is full of prigs and shrews,
Who mock the gods to whom we pray
And scatter ashes every day—
The peering vandals who refuse
To live full-handed, and abuse
(So much their virtues stale and cloy)
The very sources of our joy,
And scorn with every mawkish atom
The honest fathers that begat ’em.
And so it seems, do what wc may,
Our golden torments fade to grey,
And scowling dullards sour and prim
Deride the King and turn from him.
They say our King himself grows old,
A prey to miseries manifold,
Forgets the secrets once he knew,
And shoots his arrows all askew;
They say our Queen (the most divine),
Morose and toothless in her shrine,
114


Has doffed her girdle now she’s old,
And, lean and flaccid, squats and peers
Adown these slow remaining years,
And when she sees a lady kissed
Scolds like a very Methodist.
Shall we believe, or must we doubt
That things may even yet work out.
Till in the end some old delight
Shall blossom in the crowd’s despite ?
I do not know, nor greatly care;
There’s little promise anywhere.
We chase a dim and watery gleam,
We who were once high lords of dream :
We who would follow any ray
That fell across the flowery way
And pluck (since truth we needs must tell)
Our pleasure from the teeth of Hell,
Grow pawky and respectable ;
We knew that Psyche was no myth
And thrilled with zest of pagan noons,
With glamour of Olympian moons, —
And now we’re snubbed by Mrs. Smith ! . , .
My mounting tide of scorn I dam:
You know how meek a bard I am.
What has this grim, grey life in store
To make us love life any more ?
Good Lord, Bob ! . . . can you dream or think
That there is anything on earth.
Amid this squalid din and dearth,
But makes a fellow take to drink—
Although he be, like me, a man
Demure, a Presbyterian ?
115
DE VITA BEATA


Amid this sordid murk and strife,
How shall one live the blessed life ?
How shall one, if the gods are dead.
Worship the gods with hardihed ?
How shall one, hungry and athirst,
When the dour Fates have done their worst.
Be still resigned and glad, my boy,
With some few scattered crumbs of joy ?
I ask you questions by the gross.
I really want to know. I feel
A certain nausea through me steal.
I’ve had, I think, an overdose
Of life—this half-life that we know.
I want to clasp life, hold it close,
Enjoy the honey and the sting,
The rousing bite of everything :
The Aught and Somewhat stirs my gall.
Who long so for the Naught and All I
Fierce life I want, since Time has wings . ..
I hate all dim, diluted things !
In fearless service constant —ay,
In blood and terror, I will pay
Whatever price the gods demand,
If in their presence I may stand.
Not timid I, nor over-nice . . .
I should exult to pay the price. . . .
But what’s the good, old Bob ? You see,
We’re shackled to the Things thht Be,
And every path amid the roses
Is a preserve of Mr. Moses.
A most unsightly person, he,
A sort of prowling blasphemy ;
116
DE VITA BEATA


The things he steals you shall be lent.
If you pay daily cent per cent.
Then Mr. Smith, white-waistcoated,
Stands by to hit one on the head,
And every mortal, king or cook,
Floors daily with the Statute Book.
And Mr. Smug, the pious sly
Exploiter of our piteous hope,
A crawling creature sleek with soap,
Stands bleating like a beast near by,
And hawks the grace of God—Oh, pish !
As pedlars hawk a mess of fish.
With Moses, Smith, and Smug, old friend,
Wherever our sad steps may tend,
There’s little comfort at the end!
Little I care what men have read
Or hoped or feared or dreamt or said ;
So that he hates pretence and rant
And loathes the hatefulness of cant,
So that he docs the best he can,
With all my heart I love a man ! . . .
I swear it by my hopes now dead,
By all my dear illusions fled,
By all the bloody paths I’ve trod,
And by the blessedness of God!
And what remains ?
There’s Art. I know
What deep delight Art can bestow;
But if one woos Art day and night
She stales upon one’s appetite.
There’s Fancy. Through a smiling world
A host that laughs, gay flags unfurled.
117
DE VITA BEATA


Sprite, gnome, and dryad. . . . Very good ;
But sometimes, be it understood,
One seeks those footprints through the wood,
And finds them not. So Fancy pales
To a delight that somehow stales.
And then there’s Music. I confess
That Music is a perfect joy
Where others are so swift to cloy ;
But Music (here’s the nuisance, boy)
Is rather seldom to be found
Within this spot of dusty ground.
To live with Music, food of love,
A darling scheme is. I approve ;
But, since the truth I still must speak,
One needs must starve six days a week.
There’s Love... Nay, let such pratings cease !...
There’s also, for our sins, the Police.
Then there arc Books ; and we, I’m sure.
Are quite in love with Literature.
But Books still fail when one most needs ’em,
As every fellow knows that reads ’em,
And in this world of Gab and Gammon
Some writers are the slaves of Mammon,
Their style and thoughts a sort of jelly.
(Here’s where I snarl at Miss Corelli
And those glib sisters of her kidney—
Mean, mealy, maudlin, meek, or middeny.)
Sometimes they fail, you see, our Books.
Then there are, glory be ! the Cooks.
As I’m a still unshriven sinner,
118
DE VITA BEATA


I dearly love a decent dinner.
But then, what is the good, old chap ? . . .
I live completely off the map,
And for my heaped-up sins and guiles,
There’s not a perfect cook, mayhap,
Within a thousand hungry miles.
Wherefore, for you, dear Bob, and me
There’s just one scheme that I can see.
Life may not give us what we’d choose,
But what we have we’ll not refuse,
Marmontel says . . . the tag is trite
And I will spare you that to-night.
He means it’s better, on the whole,
If one can’t have in one’s control
The things that most delight one’s soul,
Not to refuse a penny roll.
Live in the moment when you can,
If you would be a happy man.
When you can seize your wine and cate.
Take ’em, and don’t procrastinate.
To-morrow, as old Omar swears,
And very clear this truth appears,
You may (Heaven save you from the grids !)
Be deader than the Pyramids,
With Yesterday’s Sev’n Thousand Years.
So pluck your rosebuds while you may,
Whatever Mr. Smith may say ;
And if amid the panting roses
You get your hand on Mr. Moses,
See that his story straightway closes . • .
There’s danger wheresoe’er that nose is;
Though Moses also, one supposes.
Has his own chosen glows and glozes.
119
DE VITA BEATA


If Mr. Smug you chance to meet
At midnight in a quiet street,
Do not your keen invention tax,
But strike him swiftly with an axe ;
So shall you know the solace sweet
Of a glad conscience when you’re old —
A thing, as I am sometimes told,
More precious and more rare than gold.
I wish you, Bob, old friend, and those
Good friends of ours that once I knew,
A life filled full, and not a short ’un.
Be careful when the apple glows
To red, and serpents whisper blue
Suggestions in the shade to you.
You’re still most earnest, I suppose.
You always were, you know. —Frank Morton.


A PANTOUM OF COMPETITIONS
CLATTER and shuffle of all sorts of feet.
Snuffle and chatter of voices that clash . . .
Oh! for the rest and the calm of the street. .. .
Life is a burden and thought is a hash.
Snuffle and chatter of voices that clash.
Deadly persistence of gestures awry!
Life is a burden, and thought is a hash ;
Time, the old sluggard, forgets how to fly.
Deadly persistence of gestures awry,
Horrible din of harsh notes out of tune !
Time, the old sluggard, forgets how to fly.
Dust of dead dust are the roses of June !
Horrible din of harsh notes out of tune,
Rasping sopranos that simper and peer !
Dust of dead dust are the roses of June,
Tenors that squeal kill the sweet o’ the year.
Rasping sopranos that simper and peer,
Husky contraltos that squawk in the gloom !
Tenors that squeal kill the sweet o’ the year;
There is no peace but the peace of the tomb S


Husky contraltos that squawk in the gloom,
Baritones burly that bumble and roar!
There is no peace but the peace of the tomb ;
Music hath charms for our soul . . , nevermore !
Baritones burly that bumble and roar . . .
Oh ! for an axe, or a license to shoot!
Music hath charms for our soul nevermore ;
Harmony’s murdered and done for, poor brute !
Oh ! for an axe or a license to shoot.
Twenty sopranos should die where they stand.
Harmony’s murdered and done for, poor brute—
Slain by these bawlers that pester the land !
Twenty sopranos should die where they stand, . .
Such execution would surely do good.
Slain by these bawlers that pester the land,
One thing we won’t miss ; that’s “ Not Understood ! ”
Such execution would surely do good,
(Half the reciters had better die too.)
One thing we won’t miss—that’s “ Not Understood ! ”
“ Little Jim ” —ugh ! there’s an infant for you !
Half the reciters had better die too.
Who will hang these, for the good of the race ?
“ Little Jim ”... ugh ! there’s an infant for you !
He must have gone to the hottest old place.
Who will hang these for the good of the race,
These “elocutionists,” deadly and grim ?
He must have gone to the hottest old place
Who first recited that yarn about Jim !


These “ elocutionists,” deadly and grim ! . . .
How we hate all; but the worst of ’era’s he
Who first recited that yarn about Jim.
Where he is now all the rest will soon be.
How we hate all, but the worst of ’era’s he !
(Can there be worst, where the lot arc so bad ?)
Where he is now all the rest will soon be ;
That is the thought makes a fellow feel glad !
Can there be worst, where the lot are so bad ?
Still they tramp Down, step by step, as is meet —
{That is the thought makes a fellow feel glad)—
Clatter and shuffle of all sorts of feet!


THE FELLOW THAT’S WED
THERE are things to be said for the fellow that’s
wed, however his troubles may crowd.
He has someone he knows always loves him, and
those are the things that a chap likes to know.
Oh ! it’s good to get home from the paths that we roam
and the bothers that wound and becloud.
And straight quench our drouth from an exquisite mouth,
in a couple of kisses or so.
Lord ! it’s good from the club to return (or the pub), to a
house that is quiet and dark,
And to step up the stairs in one’s socks (creaking stairs !)
to the Floor of Soft Breathing above !
It’s so good to go through that door left just for you, with
no light but your cigarette’s spark.
To the room that is fair with the scent of the hair of the
dear little lady you love !
It’s good to throw off all the slime of the trough, all the
dust and offence of the day—
To take one fair head to your shoulder, instead of cowering
alone like a spy !
Yes, it’s good, when all’s said, to be cosily wed to some girl
who is tender and gay ;
And the goodness runs deep when she stirs in her sleep
and creeps to your arms with a sigh.


BESSIE’S PHILOSOPHY
BESSIE confesses that divil a bit of her
Sorrows a scrap for the life she knows :
That though the fates may be making a skit of her,
Somebody knows !
Bessie says life’s full o’ fun, if you look for it;
Though Father Time, when he plucked youth’s rose.
Gave back considerably less than he took for it,
Somebody knows !
Bessie says men, all varieties and schools of ’em.
Are the best creatures this world can disclose,
Though the light women make asses and fools of ’em,
Somebody knows!
Bessie declares, then, that never a splash of her
Blood’s out of love with the life she knows,
Though the ould divil would fain make a hash of her,
Somebody knows !


HER CHOICE
A BRAVE little girl with the happiest eyes,
And a mouth that had tempted the placid and wise,
Was sitting one day where the sun and the breeze
Were playing their best on the flowers and the trees.
There an angel came to her. (She smiled as he came).
He stood pure and aloof like an exquisite flame.
He said : “ Girl, your happiness never shall cloy.
You may choose what you will for your absolute joy.
“ Adorable gems you may have from afar.
You may rule all men’s hearts, or be queen of a star.
Delights long forgotten on earth you shall know.
Or shall pass to new worlds if you order it so.”
She said : “ I don’t think I need choose, for you see
Those distant old stars seem so chilly to me ;
And then, Shining Shape, though you talk such a lot,
You can never improve on the lover I’ve got.”


EYES OF GOLD
STRANGE eyes mysterious as Fate, wherein
There lie dire threats of new conspiracies
And many a shadow of some ancient sin !
Though you yield not, in your caress there is
A something tender, venomous, and sweet,
A fragrance of dishonoured promises
That makes you quite alluring. These white feet
Know all the secret places of the day
And all the infamies of the midnight street.
You are the veriest wanton, and they say
A thousand things of which I will not speak,
These peering moralists that prose and bray.
Here as I muse, your face against my cheek,
Your amorous murmurings crooning through my
blood,
You’re modern, sinister, docile, and antique.
Such eyes had lithe Semiramis when she stood
Superb and cooed strong lovers to their death. . .
Ah, fortunate lovers, to such glad death wooed !
You are a lissom lady, and, i’ faith,
Should know all languorous subtleties of love,
And all fierce ecstasies of love’s pulsing breath.


O harsh and tender ! harpy, vulture, dove !
Angelic comrade ! (Monster ! Vampire ! Bat!),
The heavens are clear, Arcturus beams above, —
’Tis midnight. Get you to your roofs, sleek cat!


EPITAPH AGAINST THE DEMISE OF A
CERTAIN POLITICIAN
PLUCKED from a scene of sordidJstrife,
Death’s fingers cracked his little life.
He was a politician fit
To make Death loathe him, doing it.
He spoke no disingenuous word,
But several times seemed not absurd.
Bought like a harlot for a gaud,
He was the Snufflebusters’ bawd.
Whene’er they scolded him, i’ fegs,
He curled his tail between his legs.
But when they petted him, he ran
And chortled like an alderman.
When they white Freedom would deflower,
He’d trap the lady in an hour.
(It’s obvious to every dunce
That Freedom was a virgin . . . once.)
0


AN EPITAPH
Then, standing to survey the rape.
He’d gloat like a lascivious ape.
He fettered all the people to
The only god the snufflers knew.
And when the fetters heaviest pressed
The Snufflebusters loved him best.
He caught the people by the throat,
And gagged them with a petticoat.
A beldame waddled by full-fed.
“ Behold your ruler, men ! ” he said.
They mocked. With many a cuff and prod,
He cried, “ I say, behold your God ! ”
Where he is gone we cannot say;
But everything seems clean and gay.
I’ve heard it mentioned that in Hell
There is a new and horrid smell.
Death hides one hand where’er he goes,
And with the other holds his nose.

THE MIRROR
YOU ask me, Clairette, what a woman should be,
And you know I can’t tell as you ask it.
Could such wisdom dwell in a fellow like me,
Who has all his eggs in one basket ?
A woman worth while should be constant and kind,
Nor stoop to have truck with dishonour for pelf.
A woman worth while ? —Sweetheart, if you don t mind,
You might go to the glass and take stock of yourself.


GOSSAMER
“TIT ILL you come into my parlour ? ”
VV Said the Lady to the Fool.
“ It’s the daintiest little parlour,
And I’ll keep your heart to school.
You shall have some cakes and comfits,
And a tartlet now and then,
And you’ll not have to be jostled
By the other gentlemen.”
So he went into the parlour
Of the Lady, did the Fool.
And she taught the things they do teach
In that ancient sort of school.
He learned that truth is shabby,
And that lies are fine and sweet,
And that honour is the cheapest
Of the rubbish in the street.
“ You are sometimes rather horrid,”
Said the Lady to the Fool.
“ To monopolise the mistress
Of a well-conducted school
Is a thing that’s never dreamt of
By true gentlemen—oh, fie ! ”
Then she wrung his soul with pleasure,
And she hung it out to dry.


So the poor Fool shivered naked
In the basement, while above
He heard the honeyed murmur
Of a voice he’d learned to love.
There were kisses in the hallway:
Some new pupil come to school.
“ Will you come into my parlour ? ”
Said the Lady to a Fool.


CONTENT
A COTTAGE close beside the sea,
A few rooms comfortably fixed,
Some good cigars, a car maybe,
A thousand books adroitly mixed :
So shall the heat (two months or three)
All tolerably pass for me.
A cosy house well off the street
And shielded from the city’s din:
Without, the blustering world ; a sweet
Not too distracting wife within ;
With all things else that suit complete,
I can endure the winter’s sleet.
With just the cash I need, and three
Meals daily, exquisitely served :
With all things I deserve—ah me !
And all things I have not deserved:
I know and feel, howe’er it be,
I’ll live content with poverty.


THE GIRL
YOU may nurse a great ambition till your dearest
dream falls swooning,
You may strive to help your fellows till you die.
You may feel unfeigned contrition for your fibbing and
your mooning,
To soothe your conscience as the days go by;—
You may do the things you ought to with precision staid
and humble,
You may dodge the slimy quags of fashion’s whirl; —
But your perfect peace and pleasure (for this life’s a
dreadful jumble)
Will depend, when all is said, upon the Girl.
You may heap up monstrous riches till the haughtiest
ladies coax you,
You may win the howling plaudits of the crowd,
You may foil the crawling devils that would circumvent
and hoax you,
You may be with every blessed gift endowed; —
You may prove a very angel to the starving and forsaken,
You may cheat Perdition where Hell’s breakers curl,
You may stand ’mid all temptation honest, stalwart, and
unshaken; —
But you can’t be happy, if you miss the Girl.


You may live a life so splendid that when life for you is
ended, on your coffin shall be blended all the tears
of all the just;—
You may pluck the bays of victory from the hottest
of the battle; —
You may overcome completely all your foes, and walk
discreetly where the virtues bloom most sweetly,
till your dust goes back to dust; —
You may win the mute sad worship of all dumb hard-
driven cattle; —
You may see your hopes bloom glorious in magnificence
victorious, and ’scape all shafts that Satan’s hand
can hurl; —
You may win to full fruition, but whatever your con-
dition, your star shines in the bosom of the Girl.


THAT IMP AND CLARISSA
CLARISSA’S shoe is small and sweet
And quite Parisian; though it’s clear
Her mood is Puritan; the dear
Disdains my heart that’s lying here
Sore wounded by her sweet small feet.
Her heel is hard and sharp ; but you
May guess, if you have known a few
Clarissas, that I love her shoe.
Clarissa’s lithe ringed hand is strong
And passionate, although her will
(Alas!) must keep me pining still.
And yet I know, who foot the bill,
Clarissa’s hand can do no wrong.
Her fingers tear the hopes I’ve planned
To shreds; but (can you understand ?)
I love Clarissa's cruel hand.
Clarissa’s cool grey eyes dilate
With scorn, when my best dream is told.
Month leaps on month, and I grow old ;
And yet I know, howe’er she scold,
Clarissa’s eyes enshrine my fate.


Fruitless, each precious moment flies.
Her glances all my pleas despise ;
But, ah, I love Clarissa’s eyes !
Clarissa holds my heart in thrall;
But when I bend the knee, devout,
She’ll only snap, and frown, and pout;
And yet, however she may flout,
I love Clarissa best of all.
So somehow it is plain to me,
Clarissa is ( deliciously)
My irremediable She !

Story does seem a bit slim.
P’liceman been stabbed in Hyde Park . . .
Blanky unpleasant for him !
Story does seem a bit slim .. .
Ring up the Hospital, Gibbs.
Blanky unpleasant for him,
Gettin’ a knife in the ribs !
Ring up the Hospital, Gibbs ;
P’raps the poor blanker ain’t dead.
Gettin’ a knife in the ribs
Makes a chap long for his bed.
P’raps the poor blanker ain’t dead.
Got this dashed damp in my bones . . .
Makes a chap long for his bed.
Where in the devil is Jones!


THE KISS
I KISSED her hand;
She said, “ That’s all!
Now understand ! ”
I kissed her hand.
Much more I’d planned,
But feared to fall.
I kissed her hand;
She said, “ That’s all? ”


BALLAD OF FURRED LAW-CATS
“ . . . And these furred law-oats so curst and cruel, so mad and
thirsting after Christian blood, that we have less cause to fear
in trespassing against that mighty sovereign’s commands, than
reason to hope to live, if we do not continually stop the mouths of
these furred law-cats with such bribes and corruption. , . ."
THE widow’s meal they poison. They
Gnaw dead men’s bones with zest and glee.
The flesh they bite rots in decay—
They love it better so, maybe.
But, thank the gods, from sea to sea
Grim tocsins toll their funeral-knell
As all too late they turn and flee —
The sleek furred law-cats out of Hell.
They shed night’s vapours on the day,
Their foul breaths wheeze malariously.
And wheresoe’er their footsteps stray
Some Christ hangs on a blasted tree.
But men are slow to bend the knee
To-day to beasts that look and smell
So vilely. They have hate for fee,
The sleek furred law-cats out of Hell.
Gross and distempered, sidling, grey,
They snarl and whimper, scruple-free ;
The offal that they tear and flay
Stains this new morning odiously.


But man, the ages’ dull trustee.
Wakes now. They scutter, scream, and yell .. .
’Tis their obscene Gethsemanc . . .
The sleek furred law-cats out of Hell.
l’envoy
Brothers unfettered, you’ll agree
The change would suit them very well.
They go back home (they have the key),
The sleek furred law-cats out of Hell !


THE WIND
SHE tripped down the street,
And I saw her grey stocking,
All silvery sweet.
She tripped down the street
On delicious coy feet.
And the wind . . . was it shocking ? . . .
She tripped down the street,
And I saw her grey stocking !


NEW MOON
A DRONE of voices, and a drone
Of organ music rising to
A glad triumphant pealing tone—
And I am married, dear, to you !
So strange it seems to be so true,
I vaguely fear it may not last.
But here’s the train. We’re moving .. , Phew !
Thank heaven, that ordeal’s past!
Ah, now I hold you close, and know
The strange sweet thing is really true.
With gratitude I burn and glow :
I own all ecstasy—that’s you !
These trains arc rotten slow, but who
Knows ? —we may get somewhere next week.
I’ve got the snookiest room, dear ... Pooh !
We’re married now. Why can't I speak ?
• • • • •
It’s just the maid, kid, with the tea.
What’s that ? Don’t like ? Good Lord ! who cares ?
(You blush, you know, bewitchingly.)
I’ll get the tray.
Our shoes (two pairs)
Are winking slyly at the stairs.


The maid smiled roguishly, the goose ;
She’d better far think of her prayers
Than let her thoughts go on the loose.
• • • • •
I never saw you look so well;
It suits you, all that lacy stuff.
Great Scot! there goes the breakfast-bell.
Yes, we’ll miss breakfast, sure enough.
Your hair’s delicious when its rough-
And-tumble round your shoulders so.
Life may be one colossal bluff;
But you’re the genuine thing, you know 1
Your mouth Now, hang it, if I could
But say the things those fellows write! —
Your mouth would melt a man of wood,
Your eyes are heavy with delight.
You’re glad, dear. You said so last night,
With little sobs and sighs of love,
Things unmistakable, though slight,
That Love best knows the meaning of.
Ah, I’m content. Content!—l’d like
To shout my joy from sea to sea
And give the other chaps the spike ;
But that would be unkind of me.
I’ve known a thousand girls, maybe.
But you’re the queen of all the bunch,
You’re absolute felicity . . .
D’you think we ... should .. . get up for lunch ?




SONNETS




THE DESERT
IN the beloved kingdom of my dreams
I walked afraid, unfriended and alone :
The old blind gods slept each upon his throne,
And every nymph had fled the sacred streams:
Weary the sun cast dim discouraged beams,
And every blossomed dell that I had known
In happier days was barren : naked stone,
Sour swamp, dead leaves, a vulture’s rancorous
screams.
Then I found sobbing by the desolate way
A timid child with poor frail bleeding feet
Torn by the thorns of the rough path he’d trod.
I kissed his wounds and soothed his sore dismay,
And of a sudden found myself (ah, sweet!)
Weeping glad tears upon the knees of God!


THE HUSKS
THE dog unto his vomit, and the fool
To his vile lust returns despite his vow.
I’ve scuffled with the jackal and the sow
For garbage, and in many an infamous pool,
Of mine own loathsome thirst the piteous tool,
Have filled my mouth with horrors. Ay, but now.
Filth in my throat and carrion on my brow,
I slunk to cover past the scorner’s stool.
The breeze has kissed me brotherly, the sky
Spread out above me is serene and kind,
All frail things torn and twisted comfort me.
The world is very good, O God; for I
Found at my door (the jackals out of mind)
The whispered comfort of the tender sea.


ROME
THERE was a city of a thousand sins
That fed on splendid freedoms, and thereby
A great sad river stealing silently
Mid sobs of slaves and the Suburra’s dins
To the strong, sweet, sad sea. The clamorous twins,
Lust and Delight, held revel there, and high
Kind gods of Eld smiled down not mercilessly
On queenly harlots in their palanquins.
There is a city where cloaked vices leer
On the dead gods’ cold altars, and where all
Once-cherished liberties are highly priced;
But on the highways prelates stalk and peer.
Or at fat boards do keep high festival,
The bloated vicars of the wounded Christ.


THE GARDEN
I WANDERED in a place of trees and flowers,
Where birds sang out their joy, and soothing sound
Of hidden brooks at every step was found,
And one red flower flamed grandly through the hours
That knew no sadness, while delicious showers
Fell softly on the ecstasies around,
And everywhere within that sacred ground
Peace lay profound and calm on shrines and bowers.
But one came to my garden, who defiled
The glad sweet grass and killed the flowers there
And poisoned every brook that wimpled by.
All birds and gentle creatures were exiled,
The red flower perished in a hot despair,
And I alone could neither flee nor die.


SOLACE
MY Soul sore-wounded came to me and cried
Her sorrow in a plaining faint and sweet;
She cried of treason and abhorred deceit,
Of sleek false friends that poison gentle pride
And drag fair honour to the mart beside
The leering infamous harlots of the street.
My Soul moaned, and her tears fell on my feet
Like warm rain when the slow gold dusk has died.
I wept beside my Soul, until she turned
And sighed, “ For comfort, dear, I give thee this !
And this! ” —so our mouths met and clung a space,
Till all my being flamed in that long kiss
And ’mid the gathering dark I strained and yearned
To catch a glimpse of her long-shrouded face.


IF . . .
IF I should lose thee, dear, and all my days
Walk uncompanioned to the gates of Sleep,
My heart, o’erwhelmed by constant Sorrow’s deep
Flood of sad tears unceasing, still should praise
The gods that smiled upon the radiant ways
Where once I led thee : though mine eyes should weep
For thy bright sweetness vanished, I should keep
Unstained the records time can not erase.
Then while I blessed thee with my latest breath,
My dimmed eyes straining to the mists above,
If I should glimpse thee waiting for me there
Beyond the gates, incomparably fair.
Athirst for our eternity of love —
O generous magnificence of Death !
156


REVELATION
BEYOND the uttermost ways of soaring dream,
I sought for God, but found myself alone.
My heart within my breast sank as a stone
Set round with ice ; but still by field and stream,
In chasm and waste, I followed that faint gleam,
And found Him not; till, all my faith o’erthrown
Into a mire of doubt, I could but moan
My soul out in a misery extreme.
Then as I lay a light hand touched my brow,
And sweet soft lips besought me. For a space
I lay unmoved, too desolate to rise;
But soon I wept in thankfulness, for now.
The while I praised God for His crowning grace,
I saw Him smiling in my daughter’s eyes.
157


THE GREY LADY
SAD in that desert where my deep wounds smart,
Yestreen I met a lady old and grey.
She gazed at me, but not a word would say,
As with tired feet and slow she paced apart.
I marked her mien, and saw a cold tear start
From those grave eyes that chid and turned away . . .
Could this be She, my leman blithe and gay
Who once crooned noon and night against my heart!
I cried to her, but stooping she passed by
(I saw her tears that fell upon her breast);
No sympathy had she, nor care, nor ruth.
Again I cried, with heartbreak in the cry;
But swift she faded to the desolate West,
And vanished so, my sad, dishonoured Youth.


FROM THE ARABIC




OF A MATRON
TO the Father of Lies on a day
Came a Matron with dominant chin;
And the crafty Begetter of Sin
At her glance would have stolen away.
But she cried to him, bidding him stay,
And she poured forth a torrent of words,
Till the Harpies and other foul birds
Took flight in a grisly array.
The Monarch of Hell sat and sighed.
Quoth he, “ You’re to bide ? Say you so ?
Then I yield you my place and my pride,
And I pity the Damned as I go! ”


OF JACKALS
BEWARE the Lion in the way!
But when he’s out of sight,
The mangiest skulking Jackal may
Deride his kingly might.
The Lion’s mind is great enough
To know the Jackal sorry stuff;
And in that kingly might of his
The Jackal’s safety lies, I wis.


OF CRITICS
AWARHORSE that had faced the fray
And tasted battle in his day
Came to his Master’s house from far
And on his forehead bore a star
Which one (his Master’s Overlord)
Had given him as meet reward
For valiant service aptly done
That shone in the comparison.
But Critics whimpered then, “ Of course
That star’s unsuited to the Horse.
There’s plainly been some sort of fuss
That is a great offence to Us.”
The Critics are a noisy race
Whenever they infest a place;
And Critics out-and-out were these—
Sleek maggots in a lump of cheese.
The Warhorse little loved the smell,
But really stood it very well.


OF EELS
DEEP in the mud that fouled a stagnant pool,
A pedant Eel addressed his slimy school.
“ Stick to your mud! ” he cried, “ for mark me well,
Up in the sunlight there souls squirm in Hell.
“ Who leaves this stinking water that we taste
Is lost for aye, and evermore disgraced.
“ Fain would I tell (alas ! that words should fail)
My shrinking horror of the Nightingale.
“ Let no sad doubts assail your minds, for we
Are still God’s chosen creatures, as you see.
“ Let none betray your innocence and youth,
Since all We feel and think must be the truth.
“ How happy we, with filth and garbage crammed.
While all poor creatures not like us are damned! ”
164


OF DELIGHTS
THE years troop by in progress fleet,
And swift the rolling seasons fly.
One thing unchanging is, and sweet:
The solace of the sea and sky.
One thing delightsome is: the breeze
That laughs across the desert free,
And in oases stirs the trees
To envy of its liberty.
The years troop racing by, and fleet
The strong relentless seasons fly;
But Allah sends the changeless, sweet,
Deep solace of the sea and sky.


OF MEN
MEN are so valorous and kind,
So single-hearted, strong, and true.
That every day in this my mind
Love of my fellows springs anew.
Men are the splendour of the earth,
The chief success of Allah’s plan;
But for stupidity, and dearth
Of wit, how strange the creature Man !


OF FOLLY
THE creeping vice in you and me
Is hateful at the first; but then,
Should it once spread from sea to sea,
’Tis virtue in ten thousand men.
The crawling hates that blot and mar
The beauty of the vernal sod,
Do multiply, until they are
Accounted as the hosts of God.


OF A TOAD
A TOAD, respectable and staid,
Corrupt with fatness, bloated, dank.
Breathed stertorously in greenish shade
Beside a festering, odorous tank:
And to his children, two or three,
Confession of his Faith made he.
He said : “ The Dog’s a hateful beast,
With morals hideously debased ;
Not like Us —no, not in the least!—
Who are so very wise and chaste.
Beware the Camel and the Hog!—
They’re no more moral than the Dog.
“Beware the wicked wild Giraffe,
Who loves unblushing in the Sun :
The Jackdaw, too : I’ve heard him laugh—
Which crime is an atrocious one.
Avoid, as surely as you can.
The beastliest thing in nature, Man ! ”
The Toad, obese, disgusting, slow.
Slime glistering on his heaving flank,
Thus taught his children all arow
Beside the greenish stagnant tank.
He sat at length, the lesson done,
And sweated venom in the Sun.


OF MODESTY
MARK well the modest man, for he.
However great his Soul, will be
Forgotten by Posterity.
But still the sounding Braggart hath
Some certainty of Aftermath—
Wrath heaped against the Day of Wrath.


OF THE WORLD
THE World hath its tale of dismays and of rapine and
wrong
And grave ills that annoy :
But praise be to Allah! the World still hath Laughter
and Song
And great largess of Joy :
I irk not my soul overmuch with the rapine and wrong,
But the Laughter and Joy
Fill my life with Delight, and the sweetness of Pleasure
and Song
Salve all pains of the ills that annoy.


OF AILA
WITH Aila near me in my Tent,
My thoughts like Eagles soar and fly :
Mine is the infinite Firmament,
And Lord of all the Worlds am I!
For me there is nor Time nor Space,
But all things to my Will incline;
With these mine arms I can embrace
The Seas, and all the Stars are mine !
I taste, with each exultant breath,
Delight, Lord of my Soul am I!
The poor malignity of Death
I mock, while fools go whimpering by !


OF SPEAKING
LET loose thy Tongue, nor clamorously
Cease to deride thine Enemy:
So shall all Fools take pride in thee.
Success in careful Falsehood lies.
’Tis only foolish to be wise.
Earth is the Braggart’s Paradise.


OF YOUTH
THE Sun is a fountain of gold in the heart of the
Sky;
And the green Earth lies panting with joy of such
largess, in truth.
The fountain of gold in my Heart as these late days
go by
Is Memory’s joy in the scenes and the thoughts of my
Youth !

•[ This book is a pleasure, an education, and an inspiration. Mr. Strong

mindedness and receptivity which alone can counteract the harsh and vulgarizing
