Introduction
*
JT is my privilege and pleasure to introduce this souvenir of the 13th Quota, dealing with many
incidents, descriptive and illustrated, since we left Devonport on May Ist, 1919.
Our Quota number is superstitiously unlucky, but our experience has proved otherwise,
because we were the first Quota to pass through the various camps and stages, both in France
and England, to time, and to finish it we had the pleasure and comfort of travelling on the most
luxurious troopship that has over left England, namely, the P. & O. S.S. China.
We have during our associations with this Quota, and before joining it in the field, formed
many friendships, and I am sure that it will be a pleasure in store for us after discharge to
meet old friends in civilian clothes, no matter in which part of Australia we may cast our lot.
The thanks of all for the production of this very interesting souvenir are due to Mr. E. T.
H. Goodrich and Lieuts. Mcßae and Page.

Foreword
J N printing this souvenir it is hoped that it will be a memento of an eventful voyage.
This is wholly a shipboard production, and should prove a playground for after days when
one looks back on the world’s greatest event, an. event in which the Australian soldier earned the
right to take his place in the front rank of the world’s fighting men.
The gathering of material has not been the easiest of tasks, but what is here it is hoped will
be appreciated in the spirit in which it was given.
THE EDITOR.


H.M.A.J. “China”
SINCE she was built, ’tis twenty years or more,
And many, many times she’s crossed the sea
From England to the far Australian shore,
Carrying many settlers to be,
Who looked most fearfully, but most with hope,
To which the future held within its scope;
But surely ne’er had she such freight before —
A thousand warriors from a bloody war.
A thousand blood-stained men returned from Hell,
Foiling the Phantom Spectre of his prey;
Facing toward the land they love so well;
Eagerly, restlessly, counting every day
Till they shall see once more the loom of home.
And the old ship has ta’en them to her breast.
And with swift motion as she rides the foam
Like a deer, soothes them all to rest.
For she has seemed to share their very feelings
Since from the “Sound” and out across the “Bay”
She leapt upon the waves, her decks all reeling,
As their souls leapt to know they were away.
Thro’ the Canal she passed in moonlight sheen,
The wave she made seemed cheering them along;
Colombo past; no land to intervene,
Her singing shrouds echo their own heart’s song.
Throughout their lives the years will come and go,
They may make voyages on many ships;
But never ship will have the power, I know.
To draw such meed of praises from their lips
As this. Tho’ she be lost to sight
Their loving memories she ne’er shall lack.
Forgot, perchance, what took them to the fight;
But not —it was the China brought them back.
SGT. F. M. SHAW.


A Digger’s Diary
THE 13th Quota from Belgium embarked on
board the China at Devonport on the Ist
May. Two days before, an advance party,
consisting of 32 A.M.C. details and the same
number of artillery boarded the ship at the Royal
Albert Docks, London. This party worked hard
for forty-eight hours preparing for the main
body. The troops were indeed surprised on see-
ing their quarters, the majority of the men
having cots to sleep in containing a new mattress,
pillow and three new blankets; even the messing
utensils were new. The cleanliness of the ship
was noted by everyone and, as the first impres-
sion is always a good one, great satisfaction pre-
vailed amongst the Quota. The total number of
officers and other ranks on board was 1,113.
Shortly after dinner all were aboard, and just
before dusk the China slowly steamed away from
the docks and anchored near the entrance to
Plymouth Harbour. The trip to the latter was
an interesting one. On each man-of-war the
crew would stand to attention for a couple of
seconds and then give us three hearty cheers.
The Aussies returned the compliment. What
with the cheering, the ships’ sirens making a
screeching noise and the band playing on board
the ship, the trip was one that will never be for-
gotten. At last, at an early hour on the 2nd of
May, we started on our journey to Sydney, a
distance of 13,000 miles.
Soon after leaving Plymouth, Eddystone
Lighthouse was passed, and then the “fun” com-
menced. We were greeted by a heavy sea and
in a very short space of time the majority of the
troops were “down and out” to it. At 5 p.m,
the Bay of Biscay was entered and here the
weather was not at all pleasant and very few
came along for their tea. These conditions con-
tinued till about 3 p.m. on the following day and
then the sun came out in all its glory and every-
one brightened up. It was pleasant to sit on the
boat-deck and enjoy the sea breeze and know
that every day was bringing us nearer home.
The coast of Portugal could be seen about 6 p.m.
During the next seven days the weather was
beautiful and it was a treat to see the sun for
so long. The Y.M.C.A., Red Cross, and Com-
forts’ Fund were again to the fore—books,
magazines, cigarettes, cards and draughts were
available for the troops; a canteen and library
were also opened. From nine to eleven every
morning the troop-decks are cleaned up and at
eleven a general parade is held and the troop-
decks are inspected by the captain and the O.C.
troops with their staffs. A message was pub-
lished on Sunday the 4th from General Bird-
wood wishing us all a pleasant and speedy
journey home. Divine service, conducted by the
Rev. Jessop, was held on the hurricane deck in
the evening. The greater majority of the men
were up early on May sth to see the scenery as
we approached the Straits of Gibraltar, with the
coast of Spain on our left and Africa on our
right. Being early morning the cliffs on either
side produced an inspiring effect. The famous
Rock of Gibraltar, looking very steep and
barren, was sighted at 7.30 a.m. The weather
was fine and pleasant, and to sit on the deck
with an interesting book—well, what else could
one wish for? Sports’ Committees were formed
and they certainly did well, as all kinds of sport-
ing requisites were issued to the troops. It was
proposed to hold an Aquatic Carnival on arriving
at Port Said. Cricket matches were held in the
afternoon; in fact, a competition was arranged,
teams being chosen from the different com-
panies. At times the games were very exciting.
In the evenings dances were held, and sometimes
the nurses were present; and naturally they did
not wait long for partners. Educational Classes
were also established and everything possible
was done to make the voyage a pleasant and
interesting one. A minefield was entered on
the 7th inst, and all had their lifebelts handy.
“Boat stations” was carried out to see if every-
one knew what to do in case of necessity. Land
was sighted shortly after dinner, and afterwards
we passed quite close to the island of Pantellieria.
It was only a small place, but the land seemed to
be well cultivated. Good news in to-day’s
Orders, to the effect that we were ahead of time,
and that we stood a good chance of beating the
ship that left England eight days before us with
Australian troops.
Port Said was reached at 2.30 p.m. on
Saturday the 10th of May, and as soon as the
China anchored near the entrance to the Canal
the scene was a busy one. Boats of all des-
criptions, containing Egyptians, who had all sorts
of goods to sell, surrounded the ship. We saw


the usual sight of the native diver. Quite a
number of Light Horsemen visited the ship.
The coaling of the ships at night presented a
remarkably weird picture. The heat is making
itself felt after the cold of France and England,
and a great number of fellows are suffering from
headaches. Early the next morning the natives
were busily coaling the ship, and they are, with-
out doubt, the very last thing in filth. A
great number of troops were swimming
round the ship during the day, and quite
a number of raids were made on the boats laden
with oranges. The Swimming Carnival was held
in the afternoon. Although there were not
many items the display was a good one; time
would not permit any more events being held, as
at 5 p.m. we started on our journey again.
Another Australian troopship, the Karagola, was
anchored near the entrance to the Canal, and the
cheers were deafening as we passed her. No
doubt many of us thought of our experiences
in Egypt as we passed into the Canal. The sun-
set viewed from the ship was beautiful; a sight
that can never be forgotten. All who secured a
position on the boat-deck were lucky as the night
was bright and moonlit, and the sight of the
desert on either side very inspiring. At 11
o'clock the cheering again burst forth as we
passed two Australian camps—the 10th Light
Horse on the left, and the 4th Light Horse on
the right. Everyone who was a lover of scenery
rose early next morning to view the beautiful
outlook along the banks of the Canal. Picturesque
bungalows or Oriental houses, surrounded by
large palms, could be seen on either side. Words
cannot describe the different colouring of the
desert as the dawn was breaking. About 6 a.m.
we anchored at Suez and took on some water.
The troopship Karagola went by and we gave her
a cheer. On again shortly after breakfast, and
words fail again to describe the view that met
the eye. The Arabian Desert was on the right,
and Sinai Peninsula on the left, the shores of
which were very barren and precipitious, but the
peculiar golden colouring of the land was the
outstanding feature. Much excitement prevailed
on board at 8 o’clock when the Karagola was
passed; we had beaten her easily. Gradually the
heat is getting severe and naturally the troops
are feeling it after the cold of England. Our
first taste of severe tropical weather greeted us
on the 14th inst., and really the heat was almost
unbearable. Aden was passed on the fourth
day after leaving Suez, and then the weather
improved slightly. “Hell’s Gate,” near the
island of Perim, was passed about 5 p.m. on the
15th inst.; barren-looking place, with a light-
house here and there, and the name is most
appropriate. About midnight the light at Aden
could be seen. That same evening I saw the
Southern Cross and welcomed its appearance as
it told of the near approach to home.
After passing through the Gulf of Aden the
weather became a little cooler; we were more in
the open and away from those scorching desert
winds. The evenings of the 16th and 17th were
delightfully cool ones, and boxing contests were
held. Some good bouts were put up and the on-
lookers appreciated the display. A stop of two
hours was made in the afternoon of the 16th as
the condensers needed attention. All waste
food-stuffs were kept after dinner and dumped
overboard as soon as the boat stopped. A rifle
party was ready to shoot any sharks that were
hovering round; unfortunately only one was
seen, but owing to the excitement of the rifle
party firing too soon the shark escaped without
injury. From the 17th to the 21st the heat was
very great, and only those who have been
through the tropics can form an idea of what it
is like. The island of Sokotra was passed on the
17th inst., in fact, we were hugging its shore for
two-thirds of the day. Very barren-looking
country, and not much sign of habitation could
be seen. Quite a number of troops were ad-
mitted to hospital suffering from the heat.
Sports were held on the 18th and 19th, beginning
at 2 o’clock each afternoon. Naturally there was
not much room on deck for this kind of enjoy-
ment, and a great number of competitors visited
the hospital during the evening with sprains and
cuts. Each evening the band has given a delight-
ful concert on the after deck, and they deserve
great praise for giving performances during such
oppressive weather. Another dance was held on
the night of the 20th, and during the interval
prizes were presented to the winners of the
different sporting events. At 4 a.m. on the 22nd
we entered Colombo Harbour. The lights of the
ships scattered about were a pretty sight. The
coaling of the ship started at 7 a.m.; it was
noticed that the niggers were a much cleaner lot
than the Egyptian coolies. They seemed to com-
mand more respect, and none of the sky-larking
which took place at Port Said was repeated. The
heat became more severe as the ship stopped
moving, and it was a great relief to all when it
became known that leav* was granted from
9 a.m. to 5 p.m. to all who desired to go ashore.
At 9 a.m. the troops were conveyed ashore on


barges, and everyone seemed to enjoy the brief
visit to Colombo. Cars were available and could
be hired for two hours for the price of thirty
shillings. A great number of the troops availed
themselves of this opportunity and made a tour
of Colombo. All who did this trip will never
forget it. The first part of the tour is to Mount
Lavina, a pleasant resort by the sea, seven miles
from Colombo. At every turning of the road
something of special note met the eye of the
tourist; first, the busy scene off the main street
of Colombo, then the entry into the Native
Quarters through groves of cocoanut plantations,
and then the arrival at Mount Lavina, the view
of the sea, with the breakers dashing against the
rocks, was a fine one, and it was indeed worth
going miles to see. At the Mount is a typical
Oriental hotel, where light refreshments were
obtained before proceeding with the tour. The
return journey to the city is a roundabout one
but is indeed full of interest. Numerous places
were visited, the most famous of which were the
Buddhist Temple, Victoria Park, and the Cinna-
mon Gardens. A hurried inspection of the
former was made, and the sight-seers were
asked to sign their name in the visitors’ book.
One noticeable feature whilst spinning along the
road at Victoria Park was the great contrast in
colours. Meals were obtainable in the city at
reasonable prices. Most of those that went
ashore spent the afternoon in rickshaws. These
rickshaws were to be seen everywhere, pulled by
natives, wbo ran from one end of the town to
the other for a few pence. Crowds of troops
could be seen visiting the shops and purchasing
gifts to take home to Australia. There is cer-
tainly a charm walking in and out of the different
native shops, arguing with the shopkeepers, and
being surrounded at times in the streets by native
children begging for money. About three
hundred yards from the China six Australian
submarines were anchored, and a great number
of our troops visited them whilst returing to the
ship. At 5.30 p.m. all were aboard the China,
well pleased with their day’s outing. No time
was lost in getting away and at 8 p.m. we started
on the last part of the journey to Sydney.
h rom I hursday the 22nd, to Saturday the
31st, the voyage was an uneventful and
monotonous one. Two days travelling from
Colombo brought us into cold weather, and of
course this was very acceptable. As we
approached Australia the days seemed to drag,
and everyone was more or less tired of the trip,
especially those who were down with sea-sick-
ness again. A heavy sea greeted us 72 hours out
of Colombo, and lasted four days. The band
still continued to give recitals in the evenings.
We were expected to arrive at Fremantle on
Sunday the Ist of June, and reached there on
that date. As the dawn was breaking the shores
of the “Land of Sunshine” were sighted.
Shortly after breakfast the health authorities
came on board and an inspection was made of
the ship. Every man had his temperature taken,
and the result was an excellent one, as the ship
was pronounced clean. Shortly after dinner the
China steamed into the harbour and made fast
to a buoy about a hundred yards from the wharf.
Launches crowded with ladies were continually
approaching the ship, and the excitement
amongst the troops was great, especially
amongst the West Australians who were
recognizing someone they knew aboard the
launches. As soon as the West Australians
disembarked we were allowed asbore, and about
2.30 p.m. we were seated in the Y.M.C.A. on the
wharf drinking a “dinkum cup of Aussie tea.”
1 he men from the China received a good wel-
come here. Special trains were available to con-
vey us to Perth. At 7, the next morning, we
left for Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney, after
spending a most enjoyable trip.

SHIPS SERGEANT-MAJOR.
THE BANDMASTER.


The Aussies’ Farewell
WE came from far Australia to help to beat the Hun,
We came on business only—not expecting any fun;
But when we got to “la belle France” we found you M’amoiselle,
Intending, if we did this work, we’d have some fun as well.
You flirted, danced and sang with us —taught us to “parley-vous”;
Life would have been so rotten if it had not been for you.
But now “la guerre” is over and we’re going home again;
But tho’ we’re glad we’re going the parting gives us pain.
So farewell, M’amoiselle; M’amoiselle adieu!
Tho’ we’re going home again our hearts will be with you;
When we settle down in Aussie, and have wife and kids as well,
Vous n’oublierz jamais votre cliere M’amoiselle.
Now, when we came to “Blighty” first, to spend our ten days’ leave,
We didn’t feel quite sure what kind of welcome we’d receive.
We’d heard that English girls were cold and froze one with a glance,
But we found you just as loving as the M’amoiselle of France.
By your barrage of beauty caught—we yielded to your charms;
The war was quite forgotten when you nestled in our arms;
But now we’re off to Aussie with some of you as our wives,
And the rest will be a memory to cherish all our lives.
So good-bye, Blighty girls; Blighty girls good-bye!
Altho’ we’re glad we’re going home we leave you with a sigh;
Your winsome ways, your faces sweet, your dinky little curls,
Are twined around our hearts forever, dear old Blighty girls.

A Reflection
But whereso’er I’m doomed to roam
I still shall say —that home is home.
HOMEWARD BOUND! How pregnant of sentiment and meaning these two simple words
are. Yet there is little doubt they were identical with the thought of every man on that happy
May evening when the China cast off from her moorings and, to the accompaniment of
“Auld Lang Syne” and “Good-bye-e-” play by our band, moved slowly seaward, passing down
between two rows of formidable war-craft which lay peacefully at anchor in the harbour of
Devonport.
The cheer that rang forth from the decks of these great grey monsters was undoubtedly
intended as an appreciation of the part we had played in the recent war and an expression of
their hearty wishes for our future happiness. We were not slow to reciprocate the decided
compliment and expression of well wishes, for we too. have long since learned the worthiness
and heroism of the British Jack far.
Homeward bound! Yes, but although we can feel that joyous thrill in the depths of our
hearts; yet, indeed, how hard it is to realize after an absence of four, three, or two years, but
seemin' o- equal to all—an eternity. And to those that have waited and watched at home—what
of them—their’s surely has been the greater task. The anxious days, the restless nights, the
dreaded knock of the telegraph messenger and the uncertain news that that letter might contain.
That awful suspense. What physical pain can equal it ? What has happened during three years
of absence and war? Dare we pause and ponder? Each one of us has suffered more or less the
loss of a brother on the blood-drenched battlefield, or perhaps, seemingly greater still, the death
of a dear parent at home —or even both.
But “it is over,” and with high hopes and happier anticipation we sally forth to pick up the
broken threads, our dominating thoughts being of our resumption to home and civilian life.
