DUTCH IMPERIALISM
EXPOSED
THE GREEN HELL OF
TANAH MERAH


DUTCH IMPERIALISM
“You can fool some of the people all the
time, all the people some of the time. But you
can’t fool all thepeople all the time.”
—Abraham Lincoln.
The apologists for Dutch Im-
perialism are hard put to it to
explain away the revolt of the
Indonesian people. But tue
Dutch are nothing if not dog-
ged, and they stick determined-
ly to their impossible task of
making black look like while.
The latest Dutchman to make
the attempt is Dr. E. J. Burger,
former District Governor in
Sumatra. In the Herald of
March 16 (it is remarkable how
readily the columns of the press
are made available to Dutch
officialdom) ; he has written an
article entitled “Netherlands
Administrators Had Tough
Job.”
We assure the doctor that we
mean to make their job much
tougher! He opens by saying,
“Until a few months ago the
Netherlands Indies Government
had the reputation of being the
most enlightened and progres-
sive colonial administration in
the world.” As the Dutch In-
formation Service was the only
channel through which news
was made available, it is not
difficult to see how this repu-
tation was gained. Dr. Burger
peevishly adds, “Now this re-
putation is seldom mentioned,
but such expressions as ‘brutal
colonial imperialism, ruthless
suppression and exploitation’
are used freely and without
even a semblance of facts and
figures for support.” Well, we
shall supply some of the miss-
ing facts and figures.
DUTCH LOGIC
But first let us look at one
more paragraph in Dr. Burg-
er’s article. “How is it pos-
sible,” he asks, “for 250,000
Dutch people—l7o,ooo of them
women and children under 14
years—to keep 70,000,000 In-
donesians in an alleged state of
utter subjection?” And he goes
on to tell us that the total
number of Dutch “occupied
with governing (either with ad-
ministration or in the army
and police Force)” is 19,593,
How exact the doctor is! He
does not say how many were
occupied in purely administra-
tive posts. Now the chief Dutch
argument against giving self-
government to the Indonesians
is that only 6 per cent are
literate.
In the first place, this is the
strongest possible argument
for the inability of the Dutch
to govern. After more than
340 years they have given edu


cation to only 6 per cent of the
people! But let us examine
Or. Burger’s figures. 6 per cent
of 70 million comes to 4,200,000.
The total number of Dutch (in-
cluding children too young to
be literate'), is That
means that there are at least
17 times as many literate In-
donesians as the total number
of Dutch in Indonesia. If you
like working out sums in pro-
portion, you can take Dr. Bur-
ger’s figures of 19,593, deduct
from it the number of soldiers,
police and children too young to
be literate (if you can find out
the number), and then, taking
the residue as administrators,
work out just how many more
times the Indonesians are fitted
to govern themselves than the
Dutch are to govern them.
In passing, let us point out
that the Dutch closed down
schools which the Indonesians
opened to educate their own
people. You see the technique.
“We refuse either to educate
you or to allow you to educate
yourselves. Then we can regret-
fully claim that you are unfit
to govern yourselves.” Here is
a perfect example of a vicious
circle, created by the Dutch,
PROMISES ARE LIKE
PIECRUSTS
Now for a few of those facts
and figures whose absence Dr.
Burger deplores. We do not pro-
pose to trace, even in outline,
the history of Dutch oppression
over approximately the last
350 years. (The Dutch East
Indies Company was founded in
1602. But the Dutch had con-
tacts with the Indonesians
since at least 1595;. We have
seen one result—94 per cent il-
literacy. We shall not trace the
history of massacre, torture,
robbery and exploitation over
that long - period. The following
extract is sufficient to show
. how the Dutch behaved in the
early years of their dealing’s
with Indonesia, that is, in the
early 1600’s. It is taken from
“Cargoes and Harvests” by
Donald Culross Peattie (pp 26
& 27).
“The profits which it (the
Dutch East Indies Company)
reaped from spice enabled it to
pay enormous dividends, and
its credit was the best in
Europe. But the gold mantle
which this company wore had
its seamy side. In cruelty the
Dutch outdid the Portugese.
As traders they were more ob-
sequious to the native princes,
they were more energetic in
drumming up trade, and they
showed no misplaced religious
zeal. But their greed for mono-
poly was even worse and their
oppressive measures were in-
human. In the Isles of Spice .
. . fearing that the English
would somewhere slip in and
get cloves and nutmegs, the
Hollanders, who could not pos-
sibly keep watch over the im-
mense archipelago, decided to
confine the spices to certain is-
lands where they could be easi-
ly controlled. They went from
one island to the next and chop-
ping down and burning all the
spice trees until cloves were
left only on Ternate, and nut-
megs on Banda and Amboyna.
Java fell under their sway and


they proceeded to lay a mono-
poly on pepper, cochineal, cin-
namon, indigo, sugar, tea, and
opium. Having robbed the
Javanese of their most precious
exports, they forced the natives
to work these crops as slaves.
The story of their cruelties, even
to women, has few parallels in
history.”
The story continues in the
same vein right up to the pres-
ent day. Here, however, we shall
merely give a brief outline of
the past 27 years, that is, the
period since World War I.
In 1913 the Islamic Party was
formed, and though Governor
General Idenburg refused to re-
cognise its legality, it grew and
prospered. By 1917 its member-
ship had grown to 2,500,000 and
its influence was extending rap-
idly. By 1918 the political situa-
tion in Europe and Indonesia
had become very threatening to
the ruling classes Revolution
was in the air. So, the Governor
General of the Netherlands East
Indies. Graaf van Limburg
Stirum, made a propitiatory ges-
ture. He said, “'The new position
in Holland caused by the war
will bring also a big change in
Indonesia.” He repeated the pro-
mise on December 2, 1918, say-
ing, ‘‘The change will be put
into effect very soon, and what
we thought was too extreme in
the past is now about to hap-
pen.”
The Indonesian people, unused
even to promises, and therefore
to the breaking of them, were
naive enough to feel hopeful.
They were soon to be disillusion-
ed. The danger of revolution
passed, and with it passed the
nervousness of the Dutch. Graaf
van Limburg Stirum’s promise
was not fulfilled. The hopes of
the Indonesian people vanished.
PROGRESS BACKWARDS
In Itifl Governor General
Fock succeeded Graaf van Lim-
burg Stirum, and the Indone-
sians soon learned the useless
ness of trusting the honour of
the Dutch. By 1924 the grant
for education had dropped from
the 1921 figure of 39.4 million
guilders to 33.1 millions. In the
same period (1921-24) the grant
for health dropped from 217
million guilders to 12.7 million.
This for a population (at that
time) of more than 50 million
people.
The grant for agriculture
(and Indonesia is almost entirely
an agricultural region) was re-
duced from 5.1 million guilders
to the pitiful figure of 3.9 mil-
lion. While these drastic reduc-
tions were made, taxes rocketed
to enormous heights. Poverty
and misery increased. So appal-
ling was the position that an In-
donesian official who was loyal
to the Dutch, forwarded a report
to the Volksraad (People’s Coun-
cil), pointing out the terrible
conditions. But, as might have
been expected, no notice was
taken.
The failure of the Islamic
Party to force the Government
to improve the condition of the
people had a natural result. The
Party split into two sections, the
Left WTng breaking off to form
the Indonesian Communist
party. But the struggle for in-
dependence was not confined to
any one party. The great mass


of the Indonesian people, organ-
ised and unorganised, became
more discontented, more insis-
tent on social reform, more de-
termined to gain independence
from the hated Dutch rule,
which was driving them deeper
and deeper into misery, poverty
and starvation. They realised
that as long as they were ruled
by the Dutch, they could never
hope for better conditions.
TWO ARE A CROWD
The Dutch went from oppres-
sion to oppression. They pro-
claimed a new law forbidding
public meetings and strikes.
Article 161 of the Dutch Penal
Code says, “Anyone who initi-
ates, or urges persons to neglect
duty whereto they have bound
themselves or are bound on ac-
count qf their occupation, witii
the intention of disturbing or of
knowing or reasonably expect-
ing that such action will result
in disturbing the public peace
or the economic life of the com-
munity, is liable to a penalty of
a maximum sentence of five
years imprisonment or a maxi
mum fine of 1000 guilders.”
Thus mass protest was made
illegal. In 1926 an even more
drastic law was passed. This ac-
tually gave the Government
power to declare illegal any
gathering of more than two peo-
ple, either publicly or in a pri-
vate home. To make sure that
no criticism of the government
could be made, the Penal Code
(Art. 153, first addition) states,
“Anyone who wilfully expresses
in words, writing or drawing
(including caricature) sent!
ments with the intention of urg-
ing or recommending either
directly or indirectly, condition-
ally or in veiled terms, the dis
turbance of the public peace, or
of overthrowing or undermining
the Government in the Nether-
lands or the Government in the
Netherland Indies, is liable to a
punishment of a maximum sen-
tence of six years impiisonment
or a maximum fine of 300 guil-
ders.”
To make assurance doubly
sure a second addition to Article
153 imposed a penalty of six
years imprisonment or a fine of
300 guilders on anyone who dis-
tributes, exhibits publicly, or
advertises with the object of
giving publicity to the contents
of such writing or drawing.
PATTERN FOR HITLER
The result of these intolerable
acts of oppression was wide-
spread and spontaneous revolt in
1926 and 1927. Although the
report of a Netherlands Indies
Government Commission stated
that the revolt was caused by
poverty and ill-treatment, the
Dutch blamed the Communists.
That is an old trick. Presumably
no one realises he is hungry
poor or unhappy until the Com-
munists tell him so. The reaction
of the Dutch to the uprising
was brutal and instantaneous.
Thousands of people were
gaoled. At the notorious Glodok
gaol in Batavia many were kill-
ed by injections administered
by doctors.
Thus did the Dutch set an
example, later to be improved
on by Hitler’s “death vans.” But


even Hitler could hardly im-
prove on another pattern set by
the Dutch namely the in-
famous concentration camp of
Tanah Merah, which was estab-
lished in 1927. Tanah Merah is
in Central Dutch New Guinea,
about 200 miles from the coast,
in the worst malarial district of
the island, and is surrounded by
thick jungle, inhabited by
head-hunting tribes.
To this tropical hell were sent
1400 political ‘‘offenders.” We
use inverted commas advisedly,
for no means were taken to
prove any offence. Here is
Article 37 of the Indische Staats-
regeling (Exorbitant Act). —
“Those who can be considered
by the Government to disturb
or to have disturbed the public
peace and order will be without
any legal proceedings exiled for
an indefinite period to a special-
ly appointed place ”
This Act must surely be
unique in repressive legislation.
It meant that anyone at all
could be condemned to a rapid
or lingering death (according to
his constitution). And that is
just what happened. The fate of
these unfortunate people can be
imagined. Malaria was endemic,
blackwater fever and all the
usual tropical diseases were pre-
valent.
The food was worse than in
adequate, the punishments fre-
quent and vindictive. One man.
for example, for the “offence” of
speaking to the guards, had his
right wrist chained to his left
ankle for eight days!
Many of the inmates of Tan-
ah Merah were tortured be-
fore being sent there. Here is
just one case. A young man
accused of being in the inde-
pendence movement, had his
thumbs ,tied behind his back
and was then hoisted up so
that his toes just reached the
ground. He was left suspended
like this for 5 days and nights,
with only one meal. You see, the
Dutch suspected his brother
was in the movement, and wan-
ted a confession. Unknown to
the young man, his brother was
in the next room, and could
hear the cross-examination. At
the end of 5 days the victim
was cut down and taken to a
river. He was held by the legs
and his head was pushed under
the water till he was almost
drowned, then he was pulled
out, brought to, and again asked
about his brother. He maintain-
ed his brother’s innocence, and
the treatment was repeated at
short intervals for over an
hour. After being sent to Tanah
Merah he had over 100 attacks
of malaria, which still recur.
Escape from this green hell
was impossible. The tropical
jungle and the arrows of the
head hunters made prison walls
or barbed wire unnecessary. So
dreadful were the conditions
that men became insane, while
others unable to endure their
sufferings, committed suicide.
Those who survived are nearly
all broken in health but not in
spirit. Those who did try to
escape met their inevitable fate.
The ' indefinite period” men-
tioned in Article 37 meant, of
course, till death, unless the
internee made his peace with


the Dutch by agreeing to be-
tray his own people. Such was
the courage and determination
of these fighters for freedom
that very few took this easy
course.
THE nemesis of history
If Japan had not struck in
1941, the world would never
have heard of misrule in In-
donesia, and certainly not of
Tanah Merah. So effective was
the Dutch propaganda machine
that the myth of “progressive-
ness” of Dutch colonial policy
would have persisted. But the
flaws in that policy have now
been revealed to the world.
In 1942, Japan came South.
Singapore fell, and Allied hopes
were centred on Java. But what
happened? The Javanese had
been treated as a subject race.
They, naturally, had little in-
terest in the war. And in any
case they were not armed. The
Dutch were afraid to arm their
ill-treated slaves. So Java fell
after only a nominal resistance
by the Indonesians, and the
Dutch ran away. Then New
Guinea was threatened.
The inmates of Tanah Merah
were assembled, and were ad-
dressed with fine irony by the
head of the Dutch East Indies
Commission in Australia (Dr.
van der Plas), as “fellow-coun-
trymen.” They were told they
were to be evacuated. Except
for a very few, chiefly the old
and the sick (who reasoned that
their deaths would not help
the oncoming Japanese) the in
ternees were brought to Aus-
tralia. Their numbers were no
longer 1400, for many had died,
and some had been sent back
to Indonesia.
At first they weie victimised
by the Dutch as Japanese P.O.
W. and put into a concentration
camp at Cowra, N.S.W., under
Australian control. Later they
offered to work with the Aus-
tralian Army supporting the
war efforts, and their offer was
accepted. A few, chiefly old
men, were sent to Mackay, and
were expected to support them-
selves on 3/- a day.
When the Indonesian Repub-
lic was proclaimed in Java on
August 17, 1945, nearly all who
were employed by the Dutch
struck work, and formed the
Indonesian Independence Com-
mittee.
Recently nearly all have been
repatriated by the Australian
Government, and are now, as
far as can be ascertained, work-
ing with their fellow-country-
men under the Republican Gov-
ernment. All the Indonesians
who have been in Australia
have the friendliest feeling for
the Australian people, who
have shown the greatest pos-
sible friendship for us,
WHAT OF THE FUTURE?
We Indonesians passionately
desire two things r- independ-
ence and peace. The Dutch have
no intention of giving us inde-
pendence. In 1925 Mr. Jansen
said in the Dutch Parliament,
‘‘We do not intend to grant full
independence to Indonesia, but
merely a limited automony un-
der the Kingdom of Holland ”


Those sentiments were ap-
proved by 70 per cent of the
Parliament. You may say that
is over 20 years ago. But re-
cent events have shown that
the Dutch attitude has not
changed, but rather has be-
come firmer. And we know that
as long as we are under the
kingdom of Holland we shall be
used for the benefit of the
Dutch.
It is not our fault that we
are at war. It is the fault of
the Dutch. We hate Fascism,
because we have lived under
Dutch Fascism, which accuses
us of being pro-Japanese, That
is a lie. It is true that we took
some advantage of the disturb-
ed situation created by Japan-
ese aggression to throw off
Dutch rule. That is not because
we love the Japanese. We de-
sire their yoke no more than
that of the Dutch,
We want to be free. And in
that desire we are at one with
all the freedom-loving peoples
who have been pawns in the
imperialistic game.
And now we are free. We have
our own Government with its
democratic Constitution as we
have shown to the world. Our
Government has demonstrated
its belief in the United Nations
and its strong desire to co-
operate with technologically ad-
vanced countries in rehabilita-
tion and industrialization.
We 72,000,000 Indonesians de-
cided to defend our Government
at all costs and will press pur
claims until it is recognised.
We want to live in friendship
with all. But it must be a
friendship based on equality
and mutual respect.
Australians, you are noted
for your sense of fair play. We
are grateful for your kindness
to us. By your support of our
cause you have given an ex-
ample to the world. We thank
you.
