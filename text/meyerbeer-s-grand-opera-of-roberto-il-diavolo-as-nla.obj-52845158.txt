AS GIVEN BY THE

EAST.


MEYERBEER’S “ROBERTO IL DIAVOLO.”
The Opera of “ Robcrt lp. Diabi.k” is preceded by a short over-
ture, Andante Maestoso, led off by the trombones, a dark and mystic
Introduction, indicating the subject of the legend, the conquest of
Evil by Good, In this introduction, four pieces ore comprised—first
the instrumental symphony; secondly, the drinking chorus of Sici-
lian knights, in their enc.mpment in view of the port of i'alrmo;
thirdly, the characteristic ballad of Raimbaud , the wandering
troubadour, who tells the story of the origin of Robert le Diable,
and liis fiend-fatl er, not imagining that the two heroes of bis legend
are preset t; and, four hly, the concerted piece, terminating the
introduction, in which Robert consigns the unfortunate minstrel to
the hangman’s bands. Raimbaud is sa- eJ by the presence of his
young bride, Alice, in whom Robert recognises his foster sister.
In a romance she delivers to him the sacred mes.age, with which
she has been t barged by her mistress, his mother, on her death-bed.
She is to fleliver to Robert on the dav that he is worthy to receive
the gilt, a scroll—his mother’s will. Robert, who has been leading
a life of dissipation, admits his unworlhiness to receive the scroll,
and informs A lice of hi- affection for Isabella, the daughter of the
Prince of Sicily; he has at'emp ed to carry h>r off, but she was
rescued. Alice undertakes to bear a letter to the Princess, and,
as she rcci ivs it, sees Bertram, in wuom she recognises the like-
ness of the arch-fiend to a picture in her native village. Instinc-
tively she shrinks with horror from him. The finals of the First Act
then begins with Bertram’s inducements to Robert, to resort to
the gaming table. In this dnale, Robert sings the fialienne in
six-eight time, again-t toe folly ol loving gold. As Kobert conti ues
to lose at the table his money, he is ironically taunted by Bertram,
and he stakes his horses and armour until the chorus announces that
he has’osl all. In the •’Stret a,” Robe t is furious with rage at
the taunts of his companions, Bertram sarcastically repeating the
refrain of the SicUienne,
The Second Act is in the Prince oi Si ily’s palce. After a short
eutr’ acte, the Princess Isabella sings an air, an andantino in
three-four time, descrip ive of her 1 v for Robert. After A'ice
has presented his letter to the Princess, the latter sings the second
movement of the air, sust intd by the chorus of cmaie voices.
Then fo lows the challenge of the Prince of (Grenada, through the
hera'd, to Robert, to imet in mortal combat, which the latter
accepts, but lc is enticed by a phantom rai-ed by Bertram, to 'ure
him from the tournament, and is thus prevented from participating
in its gloi ies.
Act the Third opens with a view of the rocks of St. Irene, with an
entrance to gloomy and the ruins of an ancient temple on
the right, and a column with a cross on the left, in the foreground.
After the eutr’ acte, there is a duo between A ertram and Raim-
baud, the latter on receiving g' Id, being, impre-sed n favour f the
former. B rtram’s scene of incantation is the next piece, with the
Valse Infemale of t e invisible demons. After Bertram’s
entrance into the cavern, is a storm movement for the orche-tra,
which subsides into a ritournelle, n three-four time, as Alice


enters. Next comes the couplets of Alice, descriptive of her leaving
Norn-andy, and of the prediction of the hermit, that she would be
ultimately united to her betrothed The scene fo ! low in which she
hears the voices from the caverns, and faints at the foot of the cross
when she hears the name of Robert pronounced. A duo between
A lice and Bertram is next in succession, in which the fiend-father
finds that she has penetrated the mystery of the cavern. .She clings
to the cross for protection. Me Being her with death for herself,
her betrothed, and her aged fathei, if she discloses anything—this
exciting duo is interrupted by Robert s entrance, and a trio without
accompaniment is sung by Bertram, Robert, and Alice, at the
conclusion of which she is about to disclose to Robert her terrible
secret; but on the renewed threats ef Bertram retires, leaving
Robert and Bertam to thrmselvcs, and then the former is per-
suaded, in order to counteract the alleged demoniac acts against
herself, to resort to mystic power. The scene changes to the interior
of the ruined chapel, with the sepulchre of the nuns by moonlight.
After the recitative and incantation of Bertram, the nuns are resus-
citated and dance a Bacchanals. To this succeeds a recitative by
Robert, and the three dances ol temptation—the first of “ Intoxi-
cation,” —the second of “ Gaming,”—and the third of “ Love,”
then take place. By the last mode of seduction he is won by
Helena, and he removes the cypress branch; the dancers rejoice
that they have thus gained another victim.
The Fourth Act is in Isabella’s apartment in the palace, and
opens with a chorus of attendants of rejoicings at the approaching
marriage of the Prince and the Princess of Granada. Robert
enters with the magic branch, and transfixes the attendants. A duo
follows between him and the Princess, who is restored to animation
by his spells, at which she is horror-struck, and, in a cavatina,
appeals to his honour. In despair he breaks the branch, and is then
seized bv the soldiers, and dragged away.
The Fifth Act opens in the cloisters with a chorus of monks,
followed by a prayer. A duo ensues between Robert and bertram,
whilst the chorus is going on in the chapel, in which the fiend-father
claims his son; but the soul of Robert is saved by the intervention
of Alice, and the grand trio takes place, in which the satanic
influence is combatted by the earnest appeal* and prayers of Alice,
who eventually triumphs by the production of the will of Robert’s
mother, and the dark doom is averted: the demon-lather sinks ;
and the Opera concludes with a chorus of devotional re'oicing.

Of that God who cal's me away.
And me follow soon in heaven,

Ber Ah, believe me! this is ever
The phrase of the ungrateful.
Rob Silence, Bertram,
I hear thy fatal influences.
I hear two internal voices:
The one counsels me to do good,
And just now I felt its power;
The other counsels me to do evil.
And nothing sparest
To awaken it in me.
Ber What dost thou say I What madness
Dost thou so little know thy friend!
What fearest thou ?


Rob Thou art my friend, I know, I believe it.
Ber 1 love thee moi c than life itse f.

My friend art dragged along.
No lunger arms, m,r horses,
Have 1 to call my own.
Go thou and give them up:
There but remains to pay.
Rob, Oh ! unheard-of misfortune,
Of destiny fatal.
Oh! power transcendent.
That crushes me down.
Cho Look, look, huw he is raging,
Is bursting with passion;
He swears, he blasphemes,
Transported by grief.
Rob Beware of my anger:
I can my bad fate
Revenge upen you.


Cho We advise you to check
Your ioolish disdain,
Or fear our just rage.
And tremble yourself.
Ber What means all this noise ?
