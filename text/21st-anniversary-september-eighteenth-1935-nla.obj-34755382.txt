on the loose desert sand. They grew very sick of the sand; hut some we re-

GALLIPOLI.
February 28, 1915, saw the striking of the camp at Mena, and the next
day the 10th Battalion embarked on the “lonian,” still bound for “a destina-
tion unknown."’ Two months were spent in Mudros Harbor practising land-
mg operations, a.nd on the afternoon of April 24 the Battalion, under the
command of Colonel Weir, was allotted to its various duties. Battalion
Headquarters and “B” and “C” Companies, under Major Oldham and Captain
Jacob, transferred from the “lonian” to H.M.S. “Prince of Wales,” and later
“A” and “D” Companies, under Major Beevor and Captain Herbert, moved
over to the destroyers “Foxhound” and “Scourge."
Headquarters and “B” and “C” Companies, together with the Head-
quarters and two Companies of the Ninth Battalion, were the first to move
towards the shore, and were towed in ships’ boats by naval pinnacles m
“line abreast.’" Absolute silence prevailed; but as the boats neared the shore
the alarm was given, and they came under heavy rifle, machine-gun, and
shrapnel fire. The men leapt into the sea and waded ashore Many were
killed in the boats, others in the water; but the rest pushed forward with
fixed bayonets, and here, on the rugged heights of Gallipoli Australia first
became a nation. For four days the Battalion withstood repeated and
determined counter-attacks, being relieved on April 28 by the R.M.... In-
fantry The Battalion then proceeded to “Shell Green for a well-earned
and much-needed rest. After a short spell the Battalion were again in
action and on May 19 an attack by the Turks m great numbers was launched,
hut the enemy were mown down before the first line was reached On May
24 an armistice was granted from 7.30 a.m. until 4.30 p.m. when it was
estimated that over 3000 bodies of Turkish soldiers were buried on the
heights of Gallipoli. A period of trench warfare followed with its mono-
tonous digging and fatigues, and although the casualty lists were small,
disease made its appearance, and decimated the ranks of the Battalion.
Soon after the battles of early August, Colonel Weir who had com-
manded the Battalion since its formation, was invalided to England, an
Major Shaw assumed command. There was not much fighting during the
last months of the campaign, but the men of Anzac were on the defensive,
and under a continual strain, as they waited night and day for the expected
onslaught of the Turkish Army. On November 21 the Battalion was re-
sent to Lemnos to reorganise. Gallipoli was evacuated m De-
cember. and the end of the year found the Australians back in Egypt, and
encamped at Tel-el-Kebir.
FRANCE, 1916-1918.
Who will forget the first happy days of the Battalion’s training m
France ? After the heavy marching on the sandy plains of Egypt, to 1 b
transported to the then sunny France was paradise It was at Strazeele that
Ihc Battalion was first billeted, and we have still pleasant memories of trips
to madame’s for those plates of fried eggs and chips, and the cheerful bon
jour” of Marie as she wended her way to the adjacent fields to carry on the
work left for her bv those who were dear, now fighting for their country.
On (une 6 1916, the Battalion took over the line for the first time in
France ‘ \t times the artillery fire was heavy on both sides, but this sector
whs exceedingly quiet, and the casualties of the Battalion were only slight
This could not last, however. The Australians had won a world-wide: fame
„fighting men and thev were now to be placed on the offensive against
their mosf formidable enemy-the Hun. Armed with every modern weapon.

trained from their youth as soldiers, they were to have the opportunity of
showing their skill against the men of Australia. On Saturday night July
22 the' Battalion left Sausage Gully, and proceeded to support the 9th Ba
talion at Pozieres. Here they met with strong opposition. A Company
under Cat tab McCann, was sent to the assistance of the 9th Battalion hut

Moquet Farm, the next attack launched by the 10th Battalion was even
more costlv The artillery fire from the enemy was intense. The shattered
bodies of the dead lay along the trench, and the wounded, unable to move,
died where they fell' So mixed was the affair that our men found them-
selves fighting one another, and this was not realised until many casualties
had been inflicted.
On Ancmst 21 the Battalion was relieved, and entrained at Doullens for
Belg?um afterwards after a brief’spell, the Battalion could be
found working hard at night carrying aminol to the Canadian!Company, who

journey. Mud bespattered, carrying their full equipment, it was a weary
battalion that, late in the evening, crawled into those vermin-infested dugouts
in Rernefray Wood. Mud was everywhere! On fatigues and carrying
parties the men became covered in mud, and slept and woke in mud. But
even through all this they carried that cheerful smile, and often in the even-
ing, after their day of strenuous toil, could be heard the sound of voices sing-
ing some of their old Australian ditties. Of these men we can sincerely
quote: “In the mud and slush of things, someone always, always sings”
The Battalion took over the line near Guidecourt on November 10,
1916. The trenches, so-called, were just a mass of mud-filled shell-holes
• connected by a mud trench. It was here that the Battalion underwent its
hardest physical endurance. Numbers of men were carried out with trench
feet, and those who managed to survive had some of the most trying experi-
ences that it was possible for man to undergo. After about a week the
Battalion was relieved, and proceeded to Cardonette for reorganisation.
After a short spell of training and recreation, the Battalion again moved
forward to the same area, and Christmas of 1916 found them working on
fatigues in the forward area of the Somme.

Earlv in the following year it became known that the enemy was about
to evacuate his position, and retire to the Hindenhurg Line. On February
25 the B'attalion attacked the enemy positions at Lc Barque. which were
captured after very little resistance During the month of M arch the Bat-
talion was camped at “Shelter Wood.”' during which period useful work in
salvaging and training was carried out. A bombing accident which de _
the Battalion of several of its members was the only casualty sustame
“Shelter Wood.” On April 7 the Battalion occupied the front line in the
Louveral Sector, and next morning the enemy attacked this position,
was soon repelled with heavy casualties. It was learned later .that this attack
was made by young German soldiers, who were informed that they would
meet practically no opposition until they were miles behind
This however, proved to them sadly misleading. Many were killed hefor
reaching our front line, and those who did reach it were quickly taken
prisoners.
The Battalion was relieved by the 7th Battalion on the evening of April
16-17. The enemy had now retired to the Hindenhurg lane, where he was

to make another stand. On May 4 the Battalion moved forward to the
support of Bullecourt. Owing to the intense bombardment, many casualties
were inflicted. The 12th, who were in the front line, were being hard pressed
when “C” Company was sent to their assistance. After a violent bombard-
ment, the enemy attacked this position in large numbers, using liquid fire
shells and “flamewerfers,” driving the front line troops to the support
lines. After being reinforced by the remainder of the Battalion and portion
of the 11 tli Battalion, the front line system was again recaptured. On the
night of May 8-9 the Battalion was relieved by the iSrd Battalion, after
having added to its history one of the most formidable battles in the Great
War.
During the months of May. June, and July the Battalion found rest and
recreation in the village of Ribemont, where the Brigade sports were held,
the Battalion attaining the position of champions of the Brigade. Colonel
Jacobs having been transferred to England, Colonel Nelligan assumed com-
mand of the Battalion. On July 2(i the Battalion entrained at Albert, and

proceeded north ; detraining at Steenhecque, and marching to Staple. It was
here that two raiding parties were formed— “X”' Company under the com-
mand of Captain Hurcombe, and “Y” Company, under the command o
Captain Campbell. The Companies, under excellent conditions and com-
manders, attained to a perfect fitness as a war machine, ready or opcia ion
in the coming spring.
Earlv in September it ‘became known that the Battalion was again to
move forward, this time to the Ypres Sector, and on the 13th it parted on
its journey towards this objective. On the night of September 19-20 the
Battalion left Chateau Segard, and proceeded to take up its position as a
unit in the Third Battle of Ypres—one of the most terrific battles ever
known. Following a heavy barrage, the 3rd Brigade attacked the enemy
positions, the first and second objectives being allotted to the ; 11th and
12th Battalions, and the third objective to the 10th Battalion, X and Y
Companies attacking, the remainder of the Battalion acting as carrying
parties, etc. After the capture of the second objective a heavy barrage was
throwm on the third objective, which was then captured by the attacking
forces of the 10th Battalion. It was here that Private R. Inwood gained his
VC. Alone he left the front line trench, and proceeded to an enemy out-
post, killing’ the gun crew, and capturing a prisoner, then returning with
the gun.


After a short spell in the Steenvooclt Area, the Battalion took' over the
line in the Zonnebecke Area. On October 10 a raiding party attacked the
enemy position in Celtic Wood. At 5.30 a.m., after practically no bombard-
ment, the party moved forward to the capture of Celtic Wood, with the
object of drawing enemy fire from the 2nd Division, which was attacking
a position on the left. This proved successful, the raiding party receiving a
terrific fire from the enemy position. At a given signal the party was to
have returned to its own trenches; but owing to the death of the O.C.
(Lieut. Scott) and Sergeant Cole, who was to fire the flare, the raiders were
left without signals. Only a few managed to return, and these were relieved
the same evening by a Company of the 32nd Battalion.
On December 16 the Battalion moved into the line in the Messines
Sector Always expecting this great attack of the Germans to be launched,
the Battalion was constantly on fatigues, carrying ammunition and supplies
to the front line. B(ut the enemy made no attempt during the Battalion’s
period in the forward area. On Christmas morning, December 25, the
Battalion was relieved by the 12th,
A month in the trenches and in support was followed by a month m
reserve at Aldershot Camp. Neuve Eglise, and then, on March 2, 1918, the
Battalion, under Major Shaw, took over the line in the Hollebecke Sector.
During the relief of the 13th Battalion the enemy raided the position occupied
by “D” Company. The attack was driven off. but not before it had reached
Company Headquarters, where Major Henwood, the 0.C., refusing to sur-
render, was killed.
The enemy began his offensive on the Somme, and in April the First
Division was hurried to the assistance of the other Australian Divisions.
Within a week of the time it had left the north, however, the First
Division was back north again, for the Hun had broken through on the
Ypres Sector, and was making a bid for the Channel ports.
Detraining at Hondeghem late at night, the 10th marched to protect
Hazebrouck. On the night of April 24-25 the Battalion, in conjunction with
the 9th, attempted to capture the village of Meteren, but, unsupported by
artillery fire, this attack’ failed, and our casualties were heavy. During the
next three months the Battalions occupied the lines in the vicinity of
Strazeeie, and by constantly attacking the enemy positions, considerably
changed his plans. During an attack near Merris, Cpl. Philip Davey won
our third V.C. During a minor operation, Cpl. Davey moved forward alone
in the face of heavy machine-gun and rifle fire, silenced the gun, and placed
the gun crew out of action. During the encounter he was severely wounded.
During a tour in the front line, ‘‘A” Company was unsuccessfully raided on
two occasions—once on the night of June 30-31. and the other on the night
of July 4 —by the Hun. Both raids were successfully overcome, with much
loss to the enemy, both in guns and men. One of the most successful of
all the attacks launched by the Battalion was the capture of Merris. “A”
and “B” Companies surrounded the village, and “C” 1 Company and Head-
quarters. after little resistance, “mopped up” the village. One hundred and
eighty-seven prisoners were captured in this attack, with only thirty casualties
to the Battalion,
On July 6 the Battalion entrained at Wizemes for the south, to join
the Australian Corps, from which the Ist Division had been absent for
some months. Detraining at Pont Remy at about 5.30 a.m. on the 7th,
and proceeding by route march and bus, the Battalion worked its way
forward, arriving at the Village of Fires (Poulainville) early on the mornmg
of the Bth.
Rumors began to get abroad about great attacks, and before the village
was left that day, large batches of enemy prisoners passed through. It was
the famous Bth of August battle. The British Armies, including the Austra-
lian Corps, had attacked that morning early on a wide front, and by evening
had advanced many miles.
The Battalion spent the two days (Bth and 9th> trying to keep up with
the advancing troops, passing Conbie, Wanfusie, Abancourt, Bfciyonvillers,
Guillacicourt. On the evening of the 9th the Battalion, having settled down

several times previously, only to receive orders to move on and occupy a
fresh position, spent the night in hastily dug shelters just south of Har-
bonierres. At 6.30 a.m. on the 10th the advance started again in artillery
formation, the Battalion supporting the 9th Battalion.
Opposition was met near “Crepy Wood,” and the 9th Battalion, having
swung out of true direction, “A” Company, under Captain McCann, was sent
to clear it up. Under a heavy fire, and losing many men, the wood was
cleared, and four posts were established on the northern outskirts of the
Wood. The 9th Battalion took up its position on the eastern side of the
Wood.
At four o’clock in the afternoon a heavy bombardment, during which two
out of “A” Company's four posts were completely blown out, and the 9th
Battalion were blown out of their posts, the enemy delivered a strong
counter-attack against the remnants of “A” Company; but the Wood was
not to be theirs With one officer and seven other ranks, Captain McCann,
putting up a magnificent fight, held back the enemy, and when, at the end
of an hour, they retired, they left 90 of their dead behind. The whole of the
Wood was re-captured bj r “A” Company, and for this Captain McCann,
recommended for the highest decoration, received his D.S.O. The next
morning tw-o companies of the 10th, in conjunction with the 12th, captured
and held the village of Lihons.
On August 26 the Battalion moved through the village of Cappy, and
meeting with little resistance, advanced the line over 6,000 yards, and cap-
tured many prisoners.
Less than a month later the Battalion, on September 18, left Jeancourt,
and passing through the 12th Battalion, established themselves, after an
advance of 5,000 yards, on a 1,000-yard front. This was the last fight that
the Battalion was to undertake. The Germans were now seeking peace.
On November 11 the Armistice was signed. The final scene in the great
drama w r as ended—Germany was beaten! The battle of might versus right
had been fought and won by the Allies for the freedom of the w'orld. Aus-
tralia had proved to the world that, as one of the youngest of Britain’s
Dominions, she was prepared to assist the Motherland in her time of need.

THE POZIERES CROSS.
THE POZIERES CROSS.
The Battle of Pozieres, on July 23,
1916, was the first offensive operation in
which the 10th Battalion took part in
France, and it wa§ during it that Cap-
tain A. S. Blackburn won our unit’s and
South Australia’s first Victoria Cross in
the war. Many of the men of the bat-
talion who were killed in the heavy
fighting in the trenches known as the
O.G. lines were buried in a common
grave, which w y as marked at the time
by a rough wooden cross made from an
ammunition box. About a year later,
in June, 1917, when the battalion was
resting out of the line at Ribemont,
steps were, taken to mark with a per-
manent cross all the known graves of
members of the unit on the Somme
battlefield, and the cross in question
was erected over the large grave at
Pozieres.
This cross was sent to Melbourne by
the Australian War Memorial authori-
ties, and offered by them to the 10th
Battalion, A.M.F. The officers of that
unit, however, offered it to the club of
the 10th Battalion, A.1.F., who accept-
ed it, and will hold it in trust as a
sacred relic of their comrades who lost
their lives in the war.
Officers.N.C.O^iien
“THERE IS NO DEATH.”
I tell you they have not died,
They live and breathe with you,
They walk now here at your side,
They tell you things are true.
Why dream of poppied sod
When yotl can feel their breath,
When flowT and soul and God
Know there is no death!
I tell you they have not died,
Their hands clasp yours and mine,
They are now but glorified,
They have become divine.
They live! they know! they see!
They shout with evTy breath:
“All is Eternal Life!
There is no death! ”
