THIRTY PROPHECIES.
FEDERATION OF THE WORLD INEVITABLE
And the. progress of the world during the next hundred years from now enormous.
that of all the previous centuries put together.
The Federation of the World will first become
an enthusiastic wish and then a realised fact,
and the opinions of all mankind expressed in
print will bring it about. Men will gradually
see that a federated world with its five hundred
nationalities can be governed just as well
as the one hundred nationalities of the British
Empire are now governed; and that huge and
expensive fleets and armies, and the wholesale
slaughterings of man by his brother man are a
great mistake. The fact is fast dawning upon
mankind that the natural differences between
nations mentally, moral Iv, and physically, are
very little greater than those between brothers
of the same family.
Nor will the difference of religion prevent
the unity of the race. Of the ten principal
prevailing religions in the world, namely :
Christianity, Buddhism, Mahometanism, Hin-
dooism, Confucianism, Taouism, Judaism,
Sintooism, Sikhism, and Parseeism, the British
Empire now comprises large numbers of the
votaries of nine of them living together in
peace. The morals and leading principles of
all these religions are in the main strikingly and
astonishingly similar, pointing to the inevitable
conclusion that they one and all have been
evolved from the religious instincts existing in
the human mind, and further proving that the
mind, in its reasonings, its hopes, and aspira-
tions, is essentially alike in all mankind.
We know that it is held by many that the
ambitions and selfishness of nations, the
enmities of races, the claims of dynasties, etc.,
will prevent the federation of the world, but
mankind is changing, and growing wiser and
better. A few hundred years ago ignorance
and bloodshed, and brutality, and callousness
to human suffering, and to human wants, and
robbery, and wrong, and tyranny, and absolute
slavery, physical and mental, and hatred of
race, and religious hatred, and persecution
for opinion?s sake, sometimes even to torture
and to death, were the order of the day. Now
all this is changed, or is changing. We have
Humane Societies, and Benevolent Societies,
and Asylums, and free Hospitals, and Refuges,
and Homes, and Orphanages, and Industrial
Schools, and free national education, and free
political institutions, and local self-governments
and the equality of all men before the law. The
masses are gradually becoming educated, and
consequently more or less intelligent thinkers.
Crime is diminishing, wars are becoming
less frequent and more humane. Slavery is
almost abolished. Liberty of conscience is
nearly established. Intense national feeling
and clannishness is dying out, and a broad
humanity is taking its place. Science is work-
ing wonders with its ever multiplying, expand-
ing, and world-embracing telegraphs, railways,
steamships, commerce, and more than all with
its Printing Presses. Through all these
agencies, men throughout the world are be-
coming better acquainted with and more
friendly towards each other.
From the lowest depths of savagedom man
has arisen, and is making enormous advances
in the path of progress. And this progress is
accelerating, and will accelerate in speed more
and more. Knowledge is spreading fast.
There have been more books and newspapers
printed within the last fifty years than were
printed altogether in the world before. Yes,
startling as the statement may be, half the
literature the uorld has seen in all the long , long
ages has been produced and distributed within
the memory of men now living, and this literature
has produced, and is producing, an enormous
change for good in the mind of the world; and
besides this, human ingenuity has, within the
last hundred years, discovered or invented,
much to alleviate human suffering, it has also
invented steamships, locomotives, railways,
the telegraph, the telephone, balloons, electric
lighting, the gas engine, photography, phono-
graphy, lithography, stereotyping, printing
machines, spinning machines, sewing machines,
reaping machines, threshing machines, and
thousands of other labour-saving machines, and
tens of thousands of useful articles, conveniences
and blessings of every-day life. In fact it may
be safely asserted that mankind has invented and
discovered more during the last hundred years
in almost every branch of knowledge than was
invented and discovered in all the preceding cen-
turies of the world's history. And human
invention and discovery and mental and moral
advancement are going on faster than ever.
The world is progressing now in a geometrical
ratio, and the next hundred years will show
enormous and astounding changes. At the
end of that time it will contain two thousand
millions of human beings able to read and
write, and the educated brain power at work
will be stupendous, and will produce stupendous
results. I believe it would make human beings
of to-day stare with blank astonishment if they
could suddenly be shown where the human
race will be in the path of progress a hundred
years hence ; multitudes of unexpected start-
ling things that we do not dream of now will
be discovered, and many things that we have
a faint glimmering of will be realised. Of the
latter I will venture to make a few small pre-
dictions. I prophesy that by the year 2000?
Flying machines will be in general use, pass-
ing and repassing over every spot on earth.
Men will travel by these or some other means
to the Antipodes in a week.
A network of railways, telegraphs, telephones
and later inventions will cover the entire earth,
bringing nearer together, associating, and
fraternising all nations.
All savage and barbarous races will be sub-
jugated by more advanced nations, civilised,
and then, like grown up children, allowed the
rights of equals.
All men will be educated and advanced in
knowledge thoughout the world.
One federated and comprehensive language,
with the English as a base, and enriched with
the best and most expressive words adopted
from all other languages by an international
congress of experts, will be spoken generally
throughout the world, and will be spelt in an im-
proved manner. *
One sensible religion, including a belief in
immortality, will be believed in generally
throughout the world.
Universal suffrage will prevail throughout
the world.
The reasonable rights of women will bo
established throughout the world.
The land of the world will become the pro-
perty of all the people in the world.
Co-operation will flourish extensively, and
property will be far more equally distributed
among mankind than at present.
The duties and limits as well as the rights of
private property will be acknowledged through-
out the world. No man will be allowed to own
more than �50,000 worth of private property.
All that he obtains above that he will be
required to give or use in some way or ways as
a benefactor for the public good. If he re-
quires more than �50,000 for himself he is a
selfish man. No man can save half that
amount out of his own labour, and therefore if
he obtains it he has got more than his share and
should be satisfied, and thenceforth work for
the good of his less fortunate creatures, for the
general cause of humanity, and for commend-
able honor and glory.
Irrigation and scientific cultivation will
become general.
The earth will yield four times what it does
now.
The yearly average hours of real honest
labour will be shortened one half.
The question of public holidays will be
vastly changed. All coronation days, birth
days, saints r days, fast days, feast days, con-
stitution days, commemoration days, &c? will
be discontinued, and a sensible system of
periodic universal holidays instituted.
Probably every Saturday and Sunday, two
weeks at midsummer, and one week at mid-
winter, will be agreed on. Work is the best
thing in this world, but good honest well
regulated work with holidays to reasonably
divide it, will make all happier and produce
the best results.
Every dilatory man and woman will be per-
suaded by friends, or compelled by the common-

* As showing the progress of the English language
and the probability of its becoming the language of
the world much can be said in a few words. One
hundred years ago only 20 million people spoke it,,
principally in the United Kingdom and North America;
to-day nearly 120 millions speak it in Europe, Asia,
Africa, America and Australasia. It is already pre-
eminently the language of colonisation, commerce and
literature. It has as much literature as all other
languages put together, and this alone while it shows
its vitality, gives it an immense advantage in the race
for pre-eminence. It is a composite and progressive
language continually adopting the beautiful and ex-
pressive words of other languages and newly coined
words to itself. It is the language of a race that has
intercourse with a far greater variety of nations than
any other ; of a race that does one third of the trade,
and owns half the ships, railways, telegraphs, post
offices and printing presses of the world ; and lastly
it is the language of the wealthiest, most powerful,
most civilising, most humanising, most energetic and
most progressive race the world ever saw. As the
people of the earth become more united, the necessity
of a common language will become stronger and
stronger, and the English language by force of over-
whelming'circumstances must become that language.
wealth, to work, for work is best for all. It
produces nearly every blessing we enjoy. It
makes all mankind healthier, wealthier, wiser,
worthier, and happier.
Everybody will easily obtain proper food,
clothing, and the necessaries of life.
All knowledge-loving men will travel, and
strive to thoroughly understand the world
they live in.
Men will feel that eating, drinking, sleeping,
dressing, playing, and money-making are not
the sole purposes of life, but that they are
destined for something higher and nobler.
Men will realise that the thousand mysteries
of life and the universe are wisely ordained
to make them think and expand their in-
tellects in the process of discovering the truth.
Crime will be diminished one half.
Drunkenness will be almost banished from
the earth, and habitual drunkards treated as
lunatics.
Human disease and suffering will be dimin-
ished one half.
The average length of life will be nearly
doubled.
The sick, the infirm, and the old will be
humanely cared for.
Greater love, friendship, and happiness will
prevail among all mankind. *
The world will be federated in politics, in
religion, and in language.
And men will wonder why they were fools so
long.
You, reader, and I, shall see the fulfilment
of these simple predictions, for although a
hundred years hence we shall have passed out
of the body, yet as citizens of the wider universe
we shall be somewhere looking on as living,
intelligent and observing beings.
A great deal has been said lately about the
federation of the British Empire. This is a
step in the right direction, and I as an English-
man, feel proud that my country should lead
the way in the cause of Freedom, Unity,
Peace, and Progress. But the federation
movement will not stop at the unity of the
British Empire, nor at the federation of the
English-speaking peoples of the world. Why
should it ? There are multitudes of great
and good men among all nations. All men
are brothers, and all men would be friendly if
they only had a proper introduction to each
other, and understood one another. With the
multifarious agencies at work this introduction
of man to man the world over is coming about
fast, and fraternisation is sure to follow. For
myself I feel certain that through the increasing
extension of knowledge and intercourse among
mankind, and the rapid and irresistible march
of general human progress, the early federation
of the World is not only possible and probable
but INEVITABLE.
