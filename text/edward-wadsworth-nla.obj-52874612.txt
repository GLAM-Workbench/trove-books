These fourteen examples of Mr, Edward Wadsworth's
work were selected by the Editor, with the Artist's
approval, printedby Mr. Walter Bradley at the Morland
Press Ltd. and published by Mr. Herbert Furst at the
Little Art Rooms, 8 Duke Street, London, W.C.2,
April 1921.
There is also a Special Edition consisting of a set of 14
proofs, printed on Japanese paper, limited to 30 copies,
numbered and signed by the Artist. Price 3 guineas.


If one were to ask why Edward Wadsworth had taken
to cutting on wood, the answer would be that the
character of his draughtsmanship and also of his
painting is of a kind that harmonizes admirably with
the particular quality of line and the distribution of
black and white masses that can be achieved with the
wood block. Before the present revival of wood'
cutting the medium was generally resorted to, not
because of qualities peculiar to itself, but because it
afforded an opportunity for displaying how craftily
the woodcutter could imitate, in this much more
obdurate material, the fine effects of light and shadow
obtained with cross-hatching, stippling, etc., by the
various methods of metahplate engraving.
Now anyone who has followed with an atom of
appreciation the development of Wadsworth's art
with the brush and pencil will have noticed that
interest in the elements of form has always been the
principal factor in his scale of values, and since the
wood'cut provides the starkest means for dealing with
the relationship of masses, actually compelling the
artist to adapt his handiwork straitly to this end, its
attraction for him becomes obvious.
Nor is it surprising to find that all the prints in this
book have been taken from blocks cut “on the plank,"
that is to say, in the direction of the grain instead of,
as in the case of wood-engraving, on the cross section.
Here again Wadsworth's choice seems thoroughly in
keeping with his feeling for design, which has always
tended towards freedom and boldness of effect. As
the spectator becomes accustomed to these wood'Cuts
he will notice with constantly increasing pleasure the
intimate sequence and cohesion of the firm, black out'
lines which divide and shape so luminously the reveal'
ing spaces of light.


These irregular black and white mosaics do not yield
up all their secrets to the first glance, but the longer
they are studied the more conscious does one become
of the completeness of the artist’s conception. The
designs are full of a brilliant movement which at first
may seem an end in itself, but which is quickly seen
to be controlled by a clearly formulated logic of
arrangement which is only at a short remove from
literal accuracy. It is just here, between the literal
appearance of the scene itself, and its organization
within the space of the wood-block, that the creative
effort of the artist takes shape and substance.
If Wadsworth were called upon to justify his neglect
of literal representation he could answer conclusively
that the wood-block provides a means peculiar to
itself of making lively patterns in black and white,
and that short of this the medium could only serve to
imitate a linear convention more proper to drawing.
But really there is no need for him to justify himself
at all. His woodcuts, which so delightfully reflect his
feeling for the liveliness and energy of the scenes he
has depicted, will fully justify his method to all who
have it in them to enjoy the quality of his vision.
