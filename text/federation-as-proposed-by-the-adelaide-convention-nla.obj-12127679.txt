PREFACE.
We have sought in this little brochure to set out as impartially
as may be the most vital points of the Convention Bill. We
shall have succeeded, but indifferently, if our efforts are not of
some service both to those who have given the matter special
study and to the general body of citizens. There has been no
attempt, either to undervalue the difficulties surrounding so
delicate a problem, nor to belittle the labours of those who are
reponsible for the Draft Bill. But where we have seen great
dangers they have, without hesitation, been pointed out, and
where old and valued safeguards have been thrown aside, criti-
cism has not been spared. Should the severity of our comments
lead some to the belief that, as we oppose the Convention Bill,
we are enemies to Federation itself, we take this opportunity
to say that no one can regret more than ourselves that the
present unique chance of union is in danger of being lost to us
through the recklessness of those who desire to foist upon the
people a constitution unsuited to their requirements, and which r
even if accepted, must inevitably invite disruption and disaster.

THE COJVIPRHftTIVE HISTOHV Op FEOEHRTIOH.
The space at our disposal will not permit of more than the
briefest glance at the historical phase of the question nor can
we hope to find room for any reference to Federations other than
those P of the present century. Excluding the South American
Federal Republics, whose temporary and unstable character
render them useless as a means of guidance, there are at the
present time four great instances of Federal Government,
America, Switzerland, Canada and Germany Of these the first
is a little more than a century old, the second dates from 1848,
the four provinces of Canada federated in 1867, and Germany
adopted the Federal principle in 1871.
The constitution of each one of these differs in some essential
points, while retaining those broad general principles that
differentiate the federal from all other modes of government
Generally speaking, these points of difference have arisen
through the peculiar circumstances surrounding the birth an
growth of the federation. Thus, for instance the constitution
of the United States of America came into existence at the close
of an heroic struggle maintained with splendid conjage by
handful of people against the power of the whole Brit sh
Government, and it was under the very shadow of the British
guns that the American colonists erected their Federal Govern-
ment.
As might be expected, the constitution thus rudely heralded
was by no means a perfect one. At the Convention which
framed it there were two sets of men holding widely different
opinions ; one desiring to blend the colonies mto a nation?one
and indivisible ?the other bent on maintaining the absolute
sovereignty of the several states, and willing to consent to
a loose form of union for defence purposes only. Out of
these discordant elements there arose under the pressure of dire
necessity the compromise of the American Constitution. That
it was a compromise no competent authority has ever sought to
deny. That, it would never have been agreed to had the
American colonist been as happily free from immediate danger
as we are, is generally admitted in the speeches and writings of
those eminent men, to whose sagacity and statesmanship the
American citizen owes his independence.
With Switzerland the case is little different, and certainly the
?circumstances surrounding the establishment of her Federal
Republic are not analogous to our own. Hemmed in by the
great nations of Europe her only safety lies in unity; but
union though previously attempted and generally desired proved
no light task, for torn by faction and divided both by racial


?differences and religious hatred it was difficult to construct a
?constitution that should be acceptable to all. At length, how-
ever, a commission appointed by the Diet (equivalent to our
Federal Council) drew up one and presented it to the people,
who by a substantial majority accepted it. Although it reflected
accurately the peculiar difficulties and dangers of the Swiss
people, yet it was not to the same extent as the American con-
stitution a compromise between two extremes. As their danger
was so their constitution was a nearer approach to the
democratic ideal; for although the jealousy of the small cantons
insisted upon equal representation in the senate, as in America,
the inclusion of that ancient palladium of the people, the
referendum, placed the real power in the hands of the majority
of the people irrespective of location.
But although this admirable principle commands at once our
?attention and our approval, yet we must not forget that the
general conditions of Switzerland and the requirements of her
people are very different from ours. And, above all, we must not
overlook the fact that with all our boastful talk about our
?? blooming forth into national life ? we shall attain under federa-
tion to no more lofty position than that which we at present occupy.
Then, as now, we shall be nothing more than a dependency of
the British Crown; and so it would serve our purpose better if
instead of slavishly imitating the American or Swiss constitution
we turned to the only case of a federal government analogous
do our own?that of Canada.
Here we see a collection of British colonies federated under
the Crown?just as we propose to be. Their circumstances, too,
as might be expected, are in essentials nearly similar to our own.
There were originally only four provinces in the federation,
but one by one the other colonies have thrown in their lot until
at present it embraces eight provinces, Newfoundland alone
declining to enter the partnership. Just as in Australia, two
?colonies stand out in importance and population above the rest
?Ontario and Quebec ?the people of these two great provinces
outnumbering the remaining six. As becomes their position
they possess the balance of power in the federal government.
In the lower house, called the commons, the representatives
?are elected on the basis of population, and in the senate, the
members to which are nominated by the Governor-General, the
two great colonies have an aggregate representation of forty-
eight out of a total of eighty. This constitution, so widely
?differing from that of the United States, was the deliberate
?choice of men who all their lives had had the best oppor-
tunities of deciding upon the value of that enjoyed by their
neighbours across the border-line. It is a matter of the very
gravest importance to us at the present juncture that our
Canadian fellow colonists did reject that constitution which it


seems the peculiar prerogative of the majority of the delegates
to the Convention to cover with eulogy and to weakly imitate.
With respect to the last of our instances of Federation, the
German Empire, as it has stood for some twenty-seven years, it
must be admitted to possess some of the elements of stability
essential in the government of a nation. Like the Canadian
constitution it provides for proportionate representation in both
houses.
From this brief resume of the history of Federal Government
one thing stands out clear : Wherever external danger has-
threatened, there a compromise upon majority rule has been
effected to placate certain elements in the commonwealth..
Where the danger has been greatest the compromise has been
most complete; but when, as in the case of Canada and
Germany, no danger threatened from without, such a vicious
and unequitable expedient has never been seriously contem-
plated.
EQUfllt STATE HEPHESEfITATIOH.
The question whether each state should be represented in the
Senate, equally or in proportion to her population, may justly
be regarded as one of the vital points of the bill. The position
taken up by the advocates of Equal State Eights is this: That
federation is a partnership of states, and that consequently each
state has an interest in having an equal voice in the management
of the joint affairs of the federation.
Further, they urge that as each state prior to entering the
federation commonwealth equally enjoyed complete independ-
ence within the limits of its constitution, so under federation
that equality must be maintained by each state being represented
in the state house or senate by the same number of delegates.
To those who point out the disparity as regards population and
importance in the several states, they urge that if the smaller
states be represented only in proportion to population there can
be no guarantee that their interests will be conserved. In short
they contend, under any other conditions than those of equal
represention they would be completely at the mercy of the large
states, and that consequently they must decline to enter the
proposed federation under any other terms. In the words of
one enthusiast who gravely furnishes us with historic and
theoretic justification for their demands, they ask for ?one state
one vote, and base their request upon precisely the same
foundation on which rests the great principle ? one man one
vote.? ?


At first sight all this appears to he a most logical position to
assume, hut a short examination will reveal its utter fallacious-
ness. In the first place it is an utter abandonment of that bed-
rock of democracy, which places the government in the bands
of the majority of the people. No matter how ingeniously-this
may be cloaked by plausible and enticing arguments, nothing
can hide the fact that what these gentlemen really propose is
government by a minority. Not a minority of intelligence nor
of worth, nor even of social position, but merely a minority which
accident has located in certain portions of the continent. Nor is
the vicious proposition rendered more acceptable by an appeal
to the precedent of America. The conditions surrounding the
two countries, as we have already shown, are widely different.
Equal representation was only conceded to the smaller states of
America as a last desperate expedient to prevent the whole of
the colonies falling into the hands of their enemies.
Moreover, it is over a hundred years since this constitution
was drawn up, and during the present century democracy, which
in the early part struggled feebly with infantile impotence, is
now firmly established, and stands secure in the full vigour of
manhood. Moreover, every federation established during the
nineteenth century has provided that the will of the majority,
constitutionally expressed, shall be supreme. Canada and Ger-
many by representation according to population, and Switzerland
through the medium of the referendum. As to the contention
that the interests of the smaller states would be sacrificed under
majority rule, it is sufficient to say that in not one of the three
great federations quoted above has this taken place.
As a matter of fact this idea of the conservation of state
rights by equal representation seems a trifle ridiculous in the
face of American precedents. Bryce in his ?American Common-
wealth ? points out that the Senate has never made itself the
guardian of State interests, a statement which coming from such
a source is sufficiently convincing, but if additional proof be
required it is only necessary to quote the American civil war to
remind our readers that the only question of state rights in
Avhich the senate really stood united upon, was the question of
slavery, and before the rights of humanity could be established
millions of lives were sacrificed and a powerful minority reduced
to despair ere they could be compelled to submit to the will of
the majority.
It does not appear then that the argument of the Equal State
Eights part} 7 gains by an appeal to the precedent of America,
while history in general can afford them no support. Nor does
theory to which they so confidently turn serve their purpose any
bjtter, and their weak effort to establish a justification for


tliG absurd cry of one State one vote, by an appeal to the basic
principle of democracy, one man one vote, excites nothing but
derision.
Of course it is easy to understand, in despite of the weak-
ness of their case, that in some quarters the pro-
posal will be viewed with unmixed approval, A system
which gives to the Tasmanian voters nine as much
effective voting power as his fellow colonist in New South
Wales will be extremely popular with that favoured
individual. And away in the distant and arid wastes of West
Australia, where in some electorates thirty-nine votes return a
member of parliament having a voice, the idea of having an equal
voice with great colonies like Victoria and New South Wales is
doubtless regarded with intense enthusiasm, f See frontispiece.;
It is not quite so easy to comprehend how the people of New
South Wales are to reap any benefit from so extraordinary a
proposal. Indeed this is generally admitted by our extremely
impartial delegates to the Convention; but they urge us to
cast away narrow provincial ideas and look at the matter
from the standpoint of the man in the small colonies. This
excellent advice loses much of its strength owing to its pliant
and convenient character. It is just as excellent, and to the man
in New South a great deal more convincing, when offered in
mild expostulation to the man in the small colonies. Why dpes
he not look at the question from the standpoint of large colonies,
more especially as this happens to be in harmony with those
broad general principles upon which all governments of a
democratic nature rest.
But we are solemnly warned that if we fail to give way upon
this point the small colonies will not consent to enter the
Federation. This is sufficiently serious to give us pause, but
surely the converse is much more so. If the smaller colonies
do not give way there is the best reasons for believing that the
large colonies will not come in. Now federation without New
South Wales and Victoria would be but a farce, whereas one
embracing the four great colonies of New South Wales, Victoria,
South Australia, and Queensland would offer such advantages
to its members, that Tasmania and West Australia would be
only too glad to enter it upon any reasonable terms.
The Dominion of Canada, as we have shown an analogous
case, originally formed out of the four largest colonies, now
contains the whole of British North America with the exception
of Newfoundland. What has happened there, we may fairly
assume would be repeated here, and in any case it is absurd to
ask a great colony like New South Wales to place itself upon
an equality with Tasmania. Such a proposition, if made in
regard to Queensland and South Australia, would be an entirely


different matter, for although there would he a still great dis-
pioportion between the population of the four contracting
colonies, yet that disproportion would he by no means so serious
as at first sight might appear. As to there being any theoretical
justification for this reactionary and anti-democratic expedient
of equal representation, none but those ignorant alike of the
teaching of history, and of contemporary federation, can for a
moment contend.
Some of its advocates, more rash than their fellows, have
asserted that equal representation is inherent in the very nature
of the federal idea.
That these assertions have been unaccompanied by a solitary
reference to a writer upon the subject, whose opinions are en-
titled to any respect, is the best evidence that such an assertion
is entirely unwarranted.
This strange delusion which is sanctioned neither by an
appeal to history, nor upheld by authority, nor supported by
theory, which has been deliberately rejected in both the
Canadian and German Constitutions, and robbed of all its
dangerous powers in that of Switzerland, stands condemned as a
weak and vicious artifice whereby the majority of the people
may be governed by a minority.
And this strong indictment is not affected by the fact that in
the lower house the people will be represented according to
population. Since every man knows of his own knowledge that
in a government by two houses, it is not what the first desires as
what the second determines that moulds the legislation of the
country. If that be true of second houses in general, it is a
hundred times truer of such a second chamber as is proposed
under the bill.
Every speech in the Convention pointed to the fact that the
senate was to be the governing chamber. Elected for six years
and representing a minority of the people, largely recruited from
conservative Tasmania and West Australia, it could easily
subdue the turbulence of the lower house over whose head
hangs always the dread of a penal dissolution. It is well for
us to understand clearly that in the house where nearly all the
power is enshrined we have no controlling voice. Lt iSeq.


HESPOHSIBLE GOVEWEHT.
We have grown during these last few generations to regard
responsible government as one of the most valued safeguards
of our liberties. Yet but little more than a century has elapsed
since it was firmly established as a principle in our constitution.
Previously it had been the custom for the Crown to appoint
ministers who neither agreed amongst themselves upon a
common policy, nor enjoyed the confidence of parliament. That
chain of responsibility which now extends from the people
through their representatives to the ministry right to the Crown
itself was then unknown. The monarch, could and often did, act
in direct opposition to the advice of his ministers without their
resigning office ; nor were the ministry themselves dependent
upon a majority in parliament, for although their actions might
be criticised, their positions were secure from any assault. JN ow
all is changed, and nothing has done more to strengthen the
hands of the people than the introduction of this principle ot
responsibility to which every one of the powers of government,
from the Crown downwards, is amenable. Responsible govern-
ment has enabled the people to enjoy the advantages ot direct
government without any of the drawbacks attendant upon a
system that does not readily lend itself to the requirements ot a
great nation.
Under our present method of representative the
people rule just as undeniably as they did in the old primitive
assembly where every citizen attended personally.
If a member of parliament displease his constituents they
have means at their disposal that are usually effective to induce
him to do as they wish. If a ministry loses the confidence ot
the house it must resign or appeal to the people, if the Crown
presumes to act against th.6 advice of ministers they will resign,
and if they retain the confidence of the house the Crown must
submit.
This unvaluable instrument of democratic government is not
only confined to the British Empire, but appears unsuited to any
other form of the bicameral system than that with which we
are familiar.
It sprang into being at a time in the history of the Bribsh
parliament when the long struggle for supremacy between the
houses was drawing to a close, and victory had already inclined
towards the commons, and its subsequent development into an
integral part of the constitution has gone hand in hand with
the increasing powers of the people?s house. Not only does it
' appear incompatible with two houses endowed with co-ordinate

powers, but its sovereign virtue entirely disappears under a
system in which the predominant house represents only a
minority of the people. For in this latter contingency the
ministry, which alwaj s gravitates to that house which has the
most power, would he responsible not to the representatives of
a majority, but to those of a minority of the people. Without
pretending to accurately foreshadow what would occur under
the proposed Federal Constitution, where an attempt is made to
engraft a chamber like the American senate upon such of those
ancient principles of parliamentary government that have sur-
vived the iconoclastic hand of the Convention, we may at least
assume that a radical and as we believe a reactionary change
will be effected in our constitution. We are to have a parlia-
ment based upon the model of the United btates where the
senate is supreme, and upon this exotic growth we are asked to
believe that responsible government will work just as smoothly
as at present. For our part we do not believe it, and apparently
the Convention itself had serious doubts about the matter.
First, we hold that the balance of power being shifted from
the Lower House to the Senate will cause the bulk of the
ministry to sit in that chamber. Instead of having, as at pre-
sent, one or two representatives, the government will mainly
locate there, and the lower house will have to content itself with
the same meagre representation now allotted to the upper
house.
This startling change in our constitution would be of com-
paratively little importance if it merely meant the transference
of the ministers from one house to another, if both represented
the people in the same degree. But under the bill, as it stands,
what it implies is nothing less than the complete abandonment
of that equitable basis upon which responsible government
securely rests ; i.e., that the ministers, and through them the
Crown, should be responsible to a majority of the people?s
representatives.
How this will affect New South Wales and the larger colonies
generally requires no laboured explanation on our part to make
plain. In that house where the representatives of close on
two and a half millions of people are to have no greater power
than the scattered handful of men in AVest Australia and the
small population of the little island of Tasmania, will sit
the ministry who secure from the impotent anger of the lower
house, will regard with complacency or utter indifference, the
censures of that chamber. And if that house, inspired by the
knowledge that it represents the majority of the people, and en-
couraged by the traditions of parliamentary government, prove
turbulent, it can be dissolved on the advice of this ministry,
the majority of whom can await the issue of the appeal to the


people with unruffled calmness. For the senate, it must he
remembered, is elected for six years and cannot be dissolved
under any circumstances.
We venture to say that this reactionary proposal needs but to
?be understood by the people of this colony to be peremptorily
rejected. Nor can the gloomy outlook be lightened by the hope
that no such serious results will follow the attempt to set up an
Americanised senate as we have foreshadowed. The advantages
to be gained by a ministry, the majority of whose members are
members of the senate, are altogether too great to leave any
room for doubt as to what will occur. We are not, however,
dependent in this connection upon mere conjecture, for the
history of parliamentary government in England furnishes us
with ample evidence that when the upper house was supreme
the ministry was largely composed of members of that chamber.
When the issue of the struggle for supremacy was in the
balance, the advisers of the King were generally selected in-
differently from either House, and only since the final victory
of the commons has the ministry been (with the exception of
two representatives) entirely selected from the members of that
?chamber.
To remove any lingering doubts as to what would really occur
under a constitution similar to that proposed by the Convention,
it is sufficient to point out that no ministry could hold office in
the face of a hostile majority in the senate. Two alternatives
would be left; they could either resign or ask for a dissolution.
If they resigned they could only be replaced by men who held
the confidence of their own chamber, and who would presumably
meet the same hostility from the senate ; or they could appeal
to the people. But what could they hope for from a dissolution
that they did not already possess? An increased majority,
perhaps, but that could not help them since the senate, repre-
senting a minority of the people, would be unaffected thereby.
To say, as some shallow critics have done, that the senate
would be overawed by the verdict of the people is to overlook
the primary function of the senate which is to act as a ?salutary
check on the headloitg impulses of democracy.? .Dissolution
might follow dissolution without materially changing the
situation. The position of the senate would be impregnable,
nothing would remain for the lower house but submission.
But the idea of a ministry sitting in a house that no longer
retained any real power is absurd, and so sooner or later the
new order would evolve, and the executive be formed of
senators having the confidence of a majority of that august
body. Here the position would be reversed. Their measures,
it is true, might be rejected by the lower house, but if they
persisted in this conduct the ministry would advise the Governor
�o grant a dissolution. This weapon of a penal dissolution


would be sufficient to reduce the most obstreperous commons
to order, and so the minority of the people would by this
stupendous travesty on constitutional government be enabled
to triumphantly rule over the majority.
It may be contended that, while the lower house retains the
control of the public purse, it must ever remain the predominant
chamber. But it must not be forgotten that even in this, the
most ancient of all the common?s prerogatives, the senate has
not only the power to reject, but what practically amounts to
the power of amendment.
In any case a house that exists only by the will of the senate
must necessarily be a subordinate one.
To all this the cheerful optimist may oppose his belief that
ultimately the will of the majority of the people must prevail.
Yet while this may, perhaps, be admitted as a general truth,
what it really affirms is no more than this : ? That when driven
beyond a certain point the people have a habit of rudely
snatching the reins of government from incompetent qr weakly
hands, and asserting their rights at the point of the sword.?
If it be to this tardy but fearful adjustment of constitutional
wrongs that the admirers of the Convention Bill turn for com-
fort, we do not desire to emulate them, for they stand at once
condemned as men who pin their faith to a constitution
which is already darkened by the shadow of carnage and deadly
strife, and which invites disaster and revolution.
We are the most peaceful of people so long as there remains
a chance of redressing our wrongs by constitutional methods,
but once that is closed history speaks trumpet-tongued as to our
course of action. For it is obviously absurd to expect a whole
nation to sit impotently down under the rule of a reactionary
minority, when ?relief can be obtained by putting forth its-
strength.
FIWGE.
To design a scheme of finance entirely equal to the necessities of
federal union seems to demand a breadth of political vision and
a knowledge of political expedients beyond the abilities of our
public men. The proceedings at Adelaide and the post-conven-
tion discussion betray on their part an extraordinary poverty of
resource which the inherent difficulties of the problem hardly
justify. Mr. McMillan in his printed address to the Chamber
of Commerce modestly disclaims any pretension to the credit of
having discovered an absolutely perfect plan, a declaration that


naturally leads the reader to expect an original scheme which,
though not perfect, would yet exhibit a substantial improvement
on that proposed by the Convention. This expectation, how-
ever, is not realized, for the closest examination of his pamphlet
reveals nothing but a discursive criticism of the Adelaide scheme
strongly reminiscent in parts of the able articles by Mr. Nash
of The Daily Telegraph.
But though it would be unjust to expect a perfect arrange-
ment, we had some right to expect from the Convention a plan
conforming roughly to natural justice and free from obvious or
fundamental faults. In his pamphlet on the subject Mr. Walker
states that the scheme was only tentatively adopted, representa-
tives, owing to the limited time at their disposal, reserving the
right to criticize it at the adjourned meeting in September.
This statement plainly charges the delegates with evading their
responsibilities. It charges them with remitting for the con-
sideration of the provincial legislatures, not the final result of
their mature deliberations, but a crude and confessedly hurried
scheme which, with a remarkable misconception of the part
they were called on to play, they propose to criticise later on.
Their function was to plan, to construct; that of the provincial
legislatures to criticise and amend. Nor can any excuse be
drawn from the fact that the last proceedings of the Convention
were hurried to enable the premiers to proceed to England.
The article of federal finance was not suddenly forced on their
notice. Every delegate knew that the success or failure of the
Convention depended to a large degree upon the equitable ar-
rangement of the finances ; that the insufficient plan of the 1891
bill had led to a postponement of all practical effort towards
union, and that consequently it behoved him to prepare him-
self for the task by an earnest and systematic study of the
problem.
The difficulty of finding a fair solution has been increased,
too. by tacitly disregarding all consideration of direct taxation,
and this is to some extent explained by Mr. McMillan. He
states in his address that a prominent politician from one of the
other colonies informed him that were his party to propose any
scheme involving direct taxation its political existence would be
seriously jeopardised. In other words, the interests of Federa-
tion, and with it the highest interests of the Australian nation,
were subordinated to the temporary interest and miserable
ambition of a provincial political party.
The Departments of Customs and Excise, Posts and Tele-
graphs, Defence, Lighthouses and Quarantine, are alone to
be placed under federal control, and the revenues arising from
these will form the federal revenue, out of which are to be paid
the expenses of the transferred services, and also those of the


original services called into being by the act of union. The bill
provides that the total federal expenditure under both heads
shall not for five years exceed �1,550,000 per annum.
Uniform duties of Customs and Excise must be imposed within
two years after the establishment of the Commonwealth, and
thereupon trade and intercourse throughout the union, whether
by internal carriage or by ocean navigation, shall be entirely
free.
The Federal Parliament, divided as it will be into many con-
flicting parties advocating conflicting interests, may find it
difficult, and even impossible, to decide upon the tariff within
that period. In any case this restriction appears wholly un-
necessary and absurd when it is remembered that by federating
we hope to call into existence a body entirely sovereign in its
own domain.
Prior to the imposing of the uniform tariff, the various
provincial tariffs are to continue. The Commonwealth wall
collect the duties, and after allotting the federal expenditure
on a population basis wall return to each state the balance of its
contributions. Now, as the provinces rely to a large extent on
Customs and Excise duties for the adjustment of their budgets,
some arrangement must be made by which their solvency may
be secured. It is provided that for the first five years of
uniformity the aggregate amount to be returned to the states
per annum shall not be less than the amount returned to them
during the year preceding the imposition of the uniform tariff.
This is a collective, not an individual guarantee, and by no
means precludes the possibility of large financial loss to any
single state.
The arrangements for distributing the federal surplus after
the first year of the uniform tariff are somewhat complex, having
some of the appearance of equity but none of its essence. It
was recognised by the delegates that under no possible tariff
would the contributions per head of the various states be even
approximately equal, and a mechanical system was elaborated
for the alleged purpose of adjusting the natural and inevitable
differences. During the first year separate accounts are to be
kept, for the purpose of ascertaining as nearly as possible the
exact contribution of each state.
The actual contribution of each state during the first year of
the common tariff is ascertained, and on the figures furnished
by that year?s transaction is based a system of Procrustean
finance, which without argument, and in defiance of justice,
forcibly reduces the naturally unequal contributions of the
states to an equality. In support of this scheme it is alleged
that it wmuld be too costly and too cumbrous to perpetuate the


system of separate accounts, however much it might lend itself
to the fair adjustment of the accounts. On the results supplied
by the first year?s transactions is ascertained ?
(1) The general average contribution of revenue per head
of the whole Commonwealth.
(2) The particular average contribution per head of each
separate State.
And it is provided that when the particular average of any
state is in excess of the general average, one-fifth of the excess
is successively deducted in each of the five succeeding years
(even though the state may have increased), and
that state is credited with a diminishing amount for each of
those years till in the sixth year it is credited with the general
average of the Commonwealth as ascertained during the hrst
year. � When the particular average contribution of any state
is less than the general Commonwealth average one-fifth part
of the difference is successively added in each of the hve toi-
lowing years, and that state is thus credited with an increasing
amount for each of those years (though its actual contribution
may be the same) till in the sixth year of the uniform tariff it
will be credited with the general Commonwealth average.
During the succeeding years all the states will be credited with
the same contribution per head. Against these credits is written
the federal expenditure not otherwise provided for, allotted on
a population basis, and the surplus is returned to the state month
by month. The difference in state contribution per head dis-
closed by the first year?s separate accounts are to be equated by
lopping from the revenues of those higher than the general
average rapidly increasing amounts, and by adding_ to those
below the general average similar amounts, till at the sixth year,
on paper at least, all the contributions will be the same, ihis
scheme is based on two assumptions, both equally unwarrantable.
The first assumption is that the initial year of the common
tariff which experience tells us would be a year of uncertainty,
of change and transition, would supply a reliable basis on which
to erect a durable system*, of equitable finance. The second is
that the inequalities of contribution due to climatic and other
differences would in the short space of five years disappear or
become so small as to be negligible.
We may reasonably assume that were Federation accom-
plished the common tariff would closely resemble that of \ ic-
toria. New South Wales is the only freetrade state, and many
even of her representatives would be protectionists. ihe Vic-
torian representatives, on the other hand, would form a so
phalanx united with the desire to impose their tariff on Australia,
and to this united body the others could hardly oppose any
effective resistance.


What contribution each state would make to the federal
revenue is entirely a matter of conjecture. The Govern-
ment statisticians, however, have supplied a number of tables
which will furnish us with a ready means of exhibiting
the unfairness of the proposed scheme. One of these sets forth
the revenue that would have been paid by each of the colonies
on an ideal amount of importation (the average of the years
1893, 1894, 1895) under the Victorian tariff.
It must be admitted at once that such a table is liable to many
sources of error. The change in the tariff would produce
changes in the amount and character of the trade, though as
these changes are likely to affect the different colonies propor-
tionately, the comparative error will be small, and will not
seriously affect our conclusions as to the relative injustice of the
proposed scheme. In arriving at these conclusions, we may at
once dismiss all hope of West Australia?s entering the union.
Her revenue through Customs and Excise was last year, ended
June, 1897, �7 4s. per head, and to expect her to join a federa-
tion which would deprive her of �5 per head is idle. Eor a
similar reason Queensland cannot seriously consider union under
such terms. Applying the Victorian tariff to the average
imports of the four other colonies during 1893, 1894, and 1895,
we find from the Government Statist?s tables that New South
Wales would contribute at the rate of �2 6s , Victoria �1 95.,
South Australia �1 155., and Tasmania �1 7s. 9d. per head.
The general average contribution is �1 16s. per head. These
figures supply the basis on which the so-called scheme of adjust-
ment is to proceed.
In the first year of the uniform tariff New South Wales would
receive from the Federal Treasury �2 16s. per head of its popula-
tion, less its proportional quota of Federal expenditure ; Victoria
�1 95., less its quota, and so with the others. Next year the
injustice of the sliding scale begins to operate. As the actual con-
tribution of New South Wales is 10s, in excess of the Common-
wealth average, that colony will be credited next year not with
�2 6s. per head, but with �2 4s. The following years it will be
credited with �2 25., �2, �1 18s., and �1 16s. respectively.
These reductions in creditinvolve in the firstyear a loss of �125,000,
in the second �250,000, the third �375,000, the fourth �500,000,
and in the fifth and succeeding years �625,000. Victoria, on the
other hand, during the first year of the common tariff receives from
the Federal Treasury �1 9s. per head, less its quota of Federal
expenditure. But as this is below the Federal average, it is
credited in each of the five following years with a larger amount
than it actually subscribes. Thus next year it is credited with
�1 10s. sd, or �BO,OOO more than it contributed ; the following


three years, with increasing contributions representing respectively,
�160,000, �210,000, and �320,000. The sixth and succeeding
years it is credited with �400,000 more than it actually contributes.
Similar anomalies present themselves in the case of the other
colonies. These anomalies are exhibited graphically in Diagram II
on opposite page.
The solid black portion of the diagram, representing the share per
head of Federal expenditure, the cross-hatched portions the share per
head of the surplus. It will be observed that the cost of federation in
the case of New South Wales, as shown by the diagram, increases
rapidly up to the sixth year, at which point it is greatly out of pro-
portion to the cost of the other States. In the cases of Victoria
and Tasmania it decreases just as rapidly, while the cost to South
Australia varies but little. The smaller diagram at the bottom of
the plate exhibits the relative cost per head to each State during
the sixth and succeeding years, and vividly illustrates the injustice
of the sliding scale scheme. Had the diagram included West
Australia and Queensland the disparity in relative cost would be
still more striking, and this fact is alone sufficient to account for
all lack of Federal enthusiasm in those provinces. Combining the
facts exhibited by diagram 11. with those of diagram 111., it will
be readily seen that with the lapse of years the injustice of the
arrangement will be intensified, as every increase in the population
of New South Wales will increase her comparative share in the
cost of federal administration.
It seems to be generally conceded, even by the most frenzied
advocates of Federation, that New South Wales will pay dearly for
the boon. For the first five years of the uniform duties the
average cost will be about �300,000 a year, in addition to her
share in the expenses of the new offices. The amount of loss after
that period is variously estimated. Mr. J. T. Walker fixes it at
�650,000 per annum, Mr. Nash at �400,000, Mr. McMillan at
�668,000. Probably we would not be far wrong in fixing it at
�500,000 per annum, and as this loss varies directly with the
population, time will only add to it.
It may be of interest to compare the relative advantage to the
country of other institutions which could be obtained at the same
cost as this particular brand of federation. Half a million per
annum at present rates represents the interest charge on a loan of
�16,000,000. What material benefits could be conferred on this
colony by the expenditure of this colossal sum ? We could with
that sum carry out a bold and extensive system of water conserva-
tion and irrigation which would entirely transform a large portion
of the Western district. We could with that sum lock the Darling
from end to end, canalise its tributaries, and construct a compre-
hensive system of subsidiary channels, transforming large tracts of

the desert west into hives of human industry, displacing the flocks
which how wander idly over its vast extent by settlers, who with
irrigation and intense cultivation could individually gain a comfortable
living from the area now devoted to one sheep.
Such an expenditure, too, would have this advantage, that it
would not entail an absolute unredeemed loss, for in a few years in
increased rents for Crown lands, in augmented land values, and
even in direct charges for water supplied, the State would obtain a
revenue that would suffice to pay the annual debt cl a.'ge, In the
case of federation as proposed by the Adelaide Convention, the
annual cost of � 500,000 is a dead loss. It is represented by no
material benefit, by no asset except one that cannot be hypothecated
?national glory.
With borrowed money involving an annual charge equal to that
of the proposed union, we could develop many a stretch of rich
agricultural and pastoral land now languishing in unregarded fer-
tility for lack of railway communication. �16,000,000 expended
in public works of this kind would give an acceleration to the pro-
gress and development of this country that would make itself felt
for many a year. The abiding results of the judicious expenditure
of such a sum are difficult, if not impossible, to estimate, and no
reasoning man can hesitate in deciding between such an expenditure
and the insufficient federation proposed by- the Convention, which
while imposing an equal monetary responsibility, brings in its train
no material benefit.
We stated that the scheme of finance is based on the unwar-
rantable assumption that the first year?s transactions would form a
fair basis for the adjustment of the revenue, and that the State con-
tributions per head would tend to equality within five years. Apart
from the fact that the first year of uniform duties, with its natural
uncertainty, is eminently unsuited as a guide to following years, an
adjustment proceeding on the figures supplied by that year is likely
to place in the hands of the federal treasurer an unexpected sur-
plus, for the disposal of which no provision has been made. Mer-
chants and importers will anticipate the uniform tariff by making
heavy importations (discounting future demand) into Sydney, where
they will be landed free of duty. This will be done for the purpose
of evading the duty, and is certain to be carried on to a very large
extent. These goods will be distributed after the imposition of the
uniform tariff throughout the colonies, but will pay no duty, nor
will any of the colonies be credited with the duties on them
as Mr. McMillan erroneously thinks they will, for it is only in the
case of goods imported during that first year, and re-exported during
that year, that such crediting will take place.


The result of all this anticipatory importation into freetrade
Sydney will be that the average contribution of all the federating
eolonies will be much, lower during the first year of uniform duties
than during any succeeding year. But the contributions of that
year form the basis on which the whole plan is erected.
If South Australia contributes �1 ss. per head during chat year
it will only receive �1 ss. per head, less its quota of Federal expen-
diture next year, though its actual contribution may be �1 10s.
The revenue of all the colonies will be affected in this way by this
?evasion of the duty, with the result that the Federal Treasurer
would have on his hands an additional surplus, which he is for-
bidden to expend, and for the disposal of which no provision is
made.
The second assumption underlying the scheme, that the contri'
hutions would in five years tend to assimilate, is equally untenable*
Experience without argument can be adduced to show its fallacy
Even in cases where our tariffs are similar now, the contributions
per head vary widely.
We have only to consider what causes produce this inequality of
?contribution and then examine the effect that lapse of time is likely
to have upon them. The most potent factors in the inequality of
revenue are climate, extent and character of territory, distribution
of population, relative proportion of sexes, and character of in-
dustrial pursuits ; and though the passage of time may produce
uniformity in some ( 'eg ., the relative proportion of the sexes) it
?cannot in any way affect others. Any mechanical system, therefore,
which postulates a tendency to assimilation is certain to involve
inequality and entail injustice. It is often slated, even by gentle-
men of some repute as financiers, that were there no federal surplus,
were the federal authority to take over sufficient services and
engagements fully to absorb its revenue, this injustice would dis-
appear. Nothing can be further from the truth, for the faults of
any system based on a hypothetical equality of contribution are
are essential and cannot be removed (though they may be concealed)
by any method of absorbing the revenue.
To sum up, the financial scheme of the Adelaide Convention is
based on error, and productive of injustice. It is too rigid and
inelastic to adapt itself to the requirements of a naturally variable
revenue, and above all it effectually precludes Queensland and
West Australia from entering the union. It is idle to expect them
to make the heavy financial sacrifices such a scheme would invoke,
?even though New South Wales may foolishly decide to do so. For
this reason, if for no other, the proposal stands wholly condemned.
Though we cannot hope for. and indeed should not expect, a perfect
scheme of federation, yet we are neither called on to ratify injustice
nor to accept any arrangement that would indefinitely delay a
?complete Australian Union.

But it may fairly be urged against us that it is not sufficient to-
expose the faults of the Convention Scheme unless we are prepared r
either to show how they may be avoided, or to suggest a better
plan. We think a fundamental mistake was made in attempting
to base a scheme of durable finance upon absolute conjecture. It is
not within human prescience to judge, even approximately, the
revenues which would be collected under any given tariff. How
much more hopeless is it to expect a correct estimate with respect
to a tariff not yet decided upon ? We would, therefore, suggest
that the system of separate accounts with all its difficulties (manifest
enough, though greatly exaggerated) should be maintained for a
period of five years or even longer, and that the Federal Legislature
should at the end of that period be free to make whatever arrange-
ment they consider best. Five years? experience of the operaton of
the common tariff would furnish them with such a fund of iniform-
ation and statistics as would enable them to approach their task
comparatively with confidence. And it is only by such means that
we can have any assurance that material and permanent injustice
will not be inflicted.


SUMfIHV.
Briefly we oppose the Draft Bill because ?
(1) It does not provide for the rule of the majority.
(2) It threatens to destroy Responsible Government.
(3) It will cost this Colony �500,000 per annum.
To remedy these cardinal defects we suggest that the Bill be
amended to provide ?
�
(1) For proportional representation in the Senate,
(2) For dissolution of the Senate and Referendum (in special
cases).
(3) For a system of book-keeping for five years for the pur-
pose of obtaining a trustworthy basis on which to
adjust the finances.
{4) For amendment of Constitution by a majority of the
people of the Commonwealth, irrespective of States.
