INTRODUCTORY.
The following notes are taken from a paper
on the historical records of Lodge Samaritan,
which was prepared by the Secretary, Wor.
Bro. F. S. Mance, P.M., G.St.B., and read at
the meeting of the Lodge on the 4th Decem-
ber, 1912. It was then unanimously resolved
that the paper should be printed, and a copy
supplied to each member of the Lodge. In
preparing the matter for publication, however,
it has been considered desirable to curtail it,
and to eliminate many of the personal refer-
ences and remarks which were originally made
to lighten the mass of dry facts; but it is hoped
this will not detract from its interest to the
Brethren of Lodge Samaritan. It may be added
that by his special request, and as an earnest
of his love for the Lodge of which he is a
foundation member, the whole cost of publica-
tion has been defrayed by Wor. Bro. Frederick
Smith, P.M.


EARLY HISTORY.
The earliest record of a meeting of a Masonic
Lodge in the Northern Suburbs is in the year
1867, when a Charter was issued by the Grand
Lodge of Ireland under the hand of the Duke
of Leinster, Grand Master, to William
O’Dwyer, William Tunks and William Heron
as Master and Wardens of a Lodge to be held
at St. Leonards, Sydney. The Lodge was
numbered 290 on the Register, and, it is under-
stood, met in a School Hall in Union Street.
This information has been supplied by Wor.
Bro. Frederick Smith, who was a member of
the Lodge, and into whose possession the
original Charter passed. After such a lapse of
time this worthy Brother is unable to furnish
any details of moment respecting the Lodge
or its happenings, and application made to the
Grand Lodge of Ireland has also been unsuc-
cessful. This Charter now ranks amongst the
treasured possessions of Lodge Samaritan, and
figures as an evidence of the enthusiasm of
these early pioneers of Masonry in our midst,
as the total population of the area now em-
braced within the municipal boundaries of
North Sydney was, in 1867, less than 3,000,
and access was anything but easy or rapid,
the houses being chiefly approached by a series

(FIRST WORSHIPFUL MASTER)


of bush tracks. This is in striking contrast
to our present population of 36,000 in the
North Sydney Municipality alone, and our up-
to-date means of communication.
WRITING UP THE HISTORY.
The desirability of having- a written history
of this Lodge has engaged attention previously,
as the following extract from the minutes of
Regular Meeting of 3rd October, 1889, will
show:—
“A letter was read from Bro. Adena, S.D.,
recommending that the history of the Lodge
might be compiled by some Past Master, and
same be read at a future meeting for the benefit
of the members, also that photos be obtained with
a view of having them framed and hung in the
Lodge Room. After some discussion, in which
Bros. Patrick, Jago, Clarke and Williams took
part, it was resolved that Bro. F. Smith, being
the oldest member of the Lodge, should write
the history, and that he be empowered to ask
the assistance of other Brethren, and that the
same be read at next meeting.”
A perusal of the minutes of next meeting
fails to disclose whether Bro. Smith carried
out the trust imposed on him. After such a
lapse of time it has been difficult to get details
together, more especially as the Minute Books
and records prior to 1883 have been mislaid.
Acknowledgment has therefore to be made to


Wor. Bros. Russell, Smith, and McLean, and
to Bro. Chas. Shaw, who was Secretary during
the years 1883-1885, for much of the facts re-
lating to proceedings in earlier years. The
complete manner in which the available
minutes and records of more recent years have
been kept by Bros. Patrick, Brindly and Spain
has rendered the collation of later happenings
an easy and pleasurable matter.
THE INAUGURATION OF LODGE
SAMARITAN.
The preliminary meeting for the forma-
tion of this Lodge was held in Dind’s Hotel,
at the corner of Alfred and Fitzroy Streets, and
the necessary petition was then signed. The
name of St. Leonards Samaritan was adopted
on the representations of Bro. A. C. Budge,
who was a member of Sydney Samaritan, but
this name was, on 4th June, 1905, shortened
to that of Samaritan, as the other Lodges at
Sydney and Kiama having ceased to exist there
was no need for the locality prefix.
The Charter issued by the United Grand
Lodge of England to Lodge St. Leonards
Samaritan is dated London, 23rd November,
1876, and numbered 1654. The seven founda-
tion members noted thereon are:—Wm. Tunks,


WON BRO.FREDERICK SMITH
(FOUNDATION MEMBER 1874)


Wor. Master; M. Charlton, S.W. ; R. Smith,
J.W.; A. C. Budge, E. E. S. Kirchner, W. B.
McLeod, and H. Deane. In addition to those
named in the Charter there were the following
foundation members
T. A. Strickland F. McMartin W. E. Rielly
C. Cowles F. Smith G. Powell
J. Jago H. D, Russell J. Armstrong
A. Squire I. A. Plummer J. Monday
J. Harding I. E. Ives A. Green
T. Overell A. Shadier C. Younger
F. A. Franklin F. Adams W. Cochran
J. P. Abbott—making 29 in all.
Of these but one, Wor. Bro. F. Smith, is still
a subscribing member. It may be mentioned
that Wor. Bro. Smith was initiated in Lodge
Sydney St. Andrew’s in the year 1866, and on
the Bth January, 1913, the Brethren of Lodge
Samaritan presented him with a handsome
Past Master’s jewel, as a mark of their regard
and esteem, and to celebrate his 80th birthday,
his 47 years in Masonry, and his foundation
membership of this Lodge.
It would not be right to pass on to other
events without placing on record a deserved
tribute to the work and efforts of our late Wor.
Bro. William Tunks, who, at the request of


the founders, consented to accept the position
of first Wor. Master. He was a pioneer in
Masonry equally as he was in our Parlia-
mentary and Municipal life. He was laid to
rest by the Brethren with full Masonic honors
in Gore Hill Cemetery on the 4th April, 1883.
It is a well-known tradition that Lodge Bal-
main is the sponsor of this Lodge, and recom-
mended the granting of our Charter, but, un-
fortunately, there are no records in support
of this. However, there was a ferry service in
those days between Balmain and Blue’s Point,
and the Lodges were then and have always
been in the closest association. Wor. Bro.
Strickland, who was Worshipful Master of
Lodge Balmain in iB6O and 1864, was in turn
a foundation member of this Lodge and Wor.
Master in 1879 —facts which are strongly con-
firmatory of Lodge Balmain being in loco
parentis to Lodge Samaritan.
PLACES OF MEETING.
The first meeting place of Lodge Samaritan
was in the Oddfellows’ Hall, in Mount Street,
the Lodge being opened on the 4th July, 1876,
evidently under dispensation from the District
Grand Lodge of England, in the presence of a
large and distinguished gathering of Masons.
In November, 1882, the Lodge had moved into


MEETING PLACES OF SAMARITAN LODGE

3 METHODIST HALL
2. SOCIAL HALL.
4. MASONIC HALL


the premises in Alfred Street, at the foot of
Mount Street, and which have been variously
named the Masonic Hall and the new Social
Hall. The stay in these latter premises was,
however, of short duration. The acoustic pro-
perties of the room were defective, and the
Brethren suffered under the disabilities of having
to move the Lodge furniture at the close of the
meetings to permit of tables being set for the
South.
Accommodation was next found by the
Lodge in the Wesleyan School Hall in Hill
Street, and the Brethren met there for the first
time in October, 1883. A difficulty, however,
early arose respecting the “South.” The re-
ligious body, feeling injured in reputation by
certain impedimenta foreign to their calling
being found on the premises, placed an inter-
dict upon the “South” being held in ample
form. The Brethren had therefore to journey
from labour unrefreshed, and the necessity of
some alteration was thus becoming a burning
question.
MOVEMENT TO ACQUIRE A MASONIC
HALE.
On the 7th November, 1876, there was
initiated into Lodge Samaritan a Brother who
was to have a powerful influence in advancing


the interests and prestige of his mother Lodge,
viz., Right Won Bro. W. H. Tulloh. He was
three times Master of this Lodge, and attained
the rank of Grand Senior Warden, and for four
years was President of the Board of General
Purposes. The records shows that he was a man
of indomitable energy, striking personality, and
of determined character: and added to these
qualifications he was a splendid ritualist..
On 3rd August, 1881, Wor. Bro. Tulloh
moved:—
“That it is desirable to form a fund for the
purpose of purchasing an allotment of ground
for the erection of a Masonic Hall in St.
Leonards.”
The site then selected was at the junction
of Walker and Mount .Streets, and although
the proposal seems to have been taken up in a
determined manner, it fell through, the shares
applied for being far below even a moiety of
what was required. In no wise daunted, Wor.
Bro. Tulloh addressed a circular to the Bre-
thren in September, 1883, from which the fol-
lowing extracts are taken: —
“The question of a Masonic Hall is becoming
daily a matter of very serious moment, and it
is not difficult to foresee a deadlock at no very
distant period. You are already well aware of
the circumstances attending our removal from


RT WOR.BRO. W.H. TULLOH
(OWING TO HWOSE EFFORTS MASONIC HALL WAS BUILT)


the Masonic Hall, and we are now faced with a
further difficulty, inasmuch as we are forbidden
to use the present Hall for social purposes after
the actual Lodge Meeting is over—and at any
time we might be asked to remove altogether.
“Under these circumstances it behoves the
Brethren of Samaritan Lodge to put their shoul-
ders to the wheel and get the question of a
Hall of their own carried to a successful issue
as speedily as possible—for it is highly deroga-
tory to the dignity of the Craft to be thus
shunted from pillar to post. I trust that the
effort now being made will be cordially joined
in by every member of the Lodge, and that it
will be, as it deserves to be, unanimous, and
the burden not allowed to fall on a minority
or even a majority of the members. Every
Brother can give a helping hand, no matter what
his circumstances in life may be.” . . .
In 1884 he had the gratification of seeing a
company formed with a nominal capital of
£4,000. The cash subscribed was £2,159, and
this sum was in the main contributed by the
Brethren of this Lodge, as, out of a total of
59 shareholders, 51 were members of Lodge
Samaritan, and these took up 1,600 shares. In
addition £l3B was invested from the benevolent
funds of this Lodge. The £2,000 additional re-
quired was obtained on mortgage at 7 per cent,
for 3 years. The architect for the building was
Mr. J. J. Lough, and the contractor Mr. J. W.
Bashford. The supervising architect was Bro.
J. Smedley.


LAYING OF THE FOUNDATION STONE.
The foundation stone of the new Hall was
laid on 12th July, 1884, with full Masonic
honors, by Right Won Bro. John Williams,
District Grand Master. The following is a
facsimile of the inscription plate on the founda-
tion stone;—
It is recorded that “after the business in con-
nection therewith was concluded, the Brethren
repaired to Christ Church, where service was
conducted by the District Grand Chaplain, Wor.
Bro. E. C. M adgwick, who preached an excellent
discourse on the greatest principle of the Craft,
viz., Charity. At the close of the service the
offertory was collected, and amounted to
£l9 35., which was handed to the Treasurer of
the Lodge, a moiety being afterwards for-
warded to the Rev. A. Yarnold (the Rector)
for the poor of the parish. Subsequently a
commemoration banquet was held in the School
of Arts” (the site now occupied by the Court
House).


OPENING OF NEW LODGE ROOM.
The Lodge Room was formally opened on
7th January, 1884, and on the 9th January a
grand musical festival was held to celebrate
the opening of the Hall, the leading artists of
the day taking part. Bro. J. P. Seagar Willson
acted as manager, and Bro. J. Massey accom-
panist, the financial results being particularly
gratifying. The programme appears to have
been chosen with due regard to the sequence
of events, as, for instance, Mr. F. J. Hallewell
sang “Within these Hallowed Walls” in the
first part of the programme, and “Simon the
Cellarer” in the second part.
THE FURNISHING OF THE LODGE
ROOM.
The Brethren entered most enthusiastically
into the matter of furnishing the new Lodge
room, and a Committee, with the late Bro. R.
C. Brindley as Secretary, was formed to carry
out all details. The following report by the
Committee upon the completion of their
labours is copied from the minutes, and shows
that they were exceedingly proud of their
efforts:—
“ Since the appointment of the Committee in
1884 we have met repeatedly at various intervals,
and we have now very great pleasure in advising
that our labours have nearly drawn to a close,


and doubtless the present appearance of the
Lodge Room will be such as to receive appro-
bation from all the Brethren concerned in the
meritorious work, as well as the numerous Bre-
thren who have favoured us with their presence.
It appeared to us that only one idea actuated and
prevailed throughout the Lodge, viz., to make
this a Temple worthy of the Masonic Body in
N.S. Wales, if not in the Southern Hemisphere.”
In commenting on the results achieved the
Wor. Master, Wor. Bro. Tulloh, said at the
meeting of 6th May, 1885 :
“The marble altar, the gift of Bro. Eaton, was
a most suitable as well as the most unique thing
of its kind to be found in any Masonic Lodge,
at any rate in the Southern 'Hemisphere. The
altar would long remain a monument of Bro.
Eaton’s generosity and true Masonic feeling.
“Bro. Jago’s gift of the rough and perfect
ashlar, as could be gathered from the silver plate
upon the smooth ashlar, had a historical bearing,
inasmuch as this ashlar formed originally a por-
tion of the foundation stone of St. Thomas’
Church, North Shore, laid by the Royal Princes
when visiting Australia” (King George V. being
the survivor). The inscription reads as follows:
The Rough and Perfect Ashlars
are portions of
the original foundation stone of
St. Thomas’ Church,
North Shore,
Laid on the 6th August, 1881,
by their
Royal Highnesses Princes Albert Victor and
George, Sons of the
Most Worshipful the Grand Master of England.
Presented to the Samaritan Lodge, 1654 E.C.,
by Brother John Jago, the builder.


"To Wor. Bro. Monday and Bros. Mountford
and Storer the Lodge owed the pillars of the
Temple which stood before them so grandly, and
in such bold relief, fittingly putting the finishing
touch to what all Masons must cordially own as
a great and glorious work.”
He congratulated the Lodge upon having
achieved a work “which he thought no other
private Lodge in the Australasian Colonies
could boast of,” and concluded by making a
presentation, couching his remarks in the follow-
ing terms: —
“I now beg to present to the Lodge through
your Committee the vessels of consecration used
at the laying of the Foundation Stone of our
Masonic Hall on the 12th July, 1884. Doubtless
in due course they will likewise be used as the
vessels of Dedication of this our Lodge
Room for the sacred purposes of Freemasonry,
and become as such doubly valuable as heirlooms
to our dear old Mother Lodge. For these rea-
sons I fancy the gift will be acceptable to my
Brethren and long remain enthroned in their
memories as the symbols of one of the grandest
efforts ever made by a private Lodge in the
noblest cause of the world.”
It is interesting to note that these sacred
vessels were not only used in the dedication of
this Lodge room, but were, up to within the
last few years, utilised in connection with the
laying of the foundation stone or the dedication


of all the subsequent Lodge rooms throughout
the State, being always willingly loaned to
Grand Lodge for these purposes.
The furnitme was assessed by competent
valuers, and set down at £550, the actual charge
upon the funds of the Lodge being under £50.

DEDICATION OF THE LODGE ROOM.
The Lodge room was dedicated at a special
emergent meeting on 30th May, 1885, by Right
Wor. the Deputy District Grand Master, the
Hon. F. A. Wright. The installation of Bro.
W. J. McLeod as Worshipful Master was also
carried out on the same evening.
The following is extracted from the minutes
of the meeting:—
“Bro. Liggins, as Chairman of the Hall Com-
mittee, rose and said:
“ ‘Doubtless the Deputy District Grand Master
would be pleased to hear some information with
respect to the Hall in which they were assembled


to-night and why it was built. Although standing
as a commercial venture it could not be discon-
nected from the Samaritan Lodge, No. 1654 E.C.,
having originated in its Wor. Master and Bre-
thren. In its Lodge Room it supplied the wants
of the Craft, and in its Hall afforded a long
required convenience to the inhabitants of St
Leonards. Our Worshipful Master was the first
to conceive the idea, and with the co-operation
of the Brethren the Hall Company was formed.
Sufficient time had scarcely elapsed since the
completion of the Hall to enable the Company
to get into fair working order, but he felt sure
the affair must be a success, as there was no
other Hall large enough to suit the require-
ments of St. Leonards.’ ”
THE HALL COMPANY.
The balance sheets furnished by the Hall
Company show that the original cost of the
land and building was £4,176. The expectations
of the Chairman, previously quoted, were not,
however, realised. Owing to a dispute be-
tween the two Boroughs the roadway in front
of the building remained unformed for several
years. The site was not altogether a suitable
one, and this interfered with the letting of the
shops, while the Hall was far in advance of the
then requirements of the district. The Hall
accordingly drifted into the hands of the mort-
gagees. The Lodge has, however, retained
possession of the Lodge room for over 28 years.


PROGRESS OF THE LODGE AND OF
MASONRY IN THE DISTRICT.
On the 31st December, 1882, the subscribing
brethren numbered 59, but the Lodge made
rapid headway thereafter, as disclosed by the
following resolution, moved in March, 1885: —
"That as the roll of membership had reached
100 the initiation fee be raised to £lO/10/-, and
the joining fee to £4/4/-.” The further growth
of Masonry in the district is shown by there
being nine Lodges now in the Northern
Suburbs. Of these, Samaritan had the honor
of recommending the granting of Charters to
Lodge Kuring-gai on 4th December, 1901, to
Lodge Rawson on xst May, 1907, and Neutral
Bay, 4th May, 1910.
AMALGAMATION OF THE SEVERAL
CONSTITUTIONS.
As already mentioned, this Lodge received
its original Charter from the Grand Lodge of
England, and all the working so far referred to
were under the English Constitution.
The Brethren of this Lodge, however, took
a very great interest in the amalgamation of
the various Constitutions, viz., those of Eng


land, Scotland and New South Wales, then
active in this State. The following' motion by
Bro. Joseph Monday, P.M., Past District Grand
Junior Deacon, appears on the business paper of
meeting of 7th March, 1888: —
“That in the opinion of this Lodge the time
has arrived when efforts should be made to bring
about an understanding between the various
divisions of Freemasons in this Colony, and to
promote that harmony which should prevail among
members of the Craft.”
This is an index of the general movement
which was taking place throughout the Craft,
and the Articles of Union of the several Con-
stitutions were assented to by this Lodge on
20th June, 1888. Right Wor. Bro. Tulloh was
elected first President of the Board of General
Purposes, which office he also filled during the
three succeeding years.
Our altar and Volume of the Sacred Law
were utilised at the obligation of our first Grand
Master under the New South Wales Constitu-
tion, and an illuminated inscription plate in the
Volume sets out this fact.
Before the issue of the Charter under the
U.G.L. of New South Wales the meetings were
held by dispensation, and it is worthy of note,
and as showing that this Lodge was taking a






very great interest in the movement, that the
dispensations for all Lodges were written out
by our then Secretary, Bro. R. C. Brindley, in
co-operation with our revered Grand Secretary,
Rt. Wor. Bro. Bray.
The following is the Declaration which the
Brethren were at the time required to sub-
scribe to:—
“We, who have affixed our signatures here-
under, declare that we have already signed the
Articles of Union, or do hereby signify our
assent thereto.”
The following is a list of Brethren who have
held office in Grand Lodge under the New
South Wales Constitution.

Purposes, 1888/9, 1889/90,

It will be noticed that during the twenty-five
years the United Grand Lodge of New South
Wales has been constituted, this Lodge has
been represented on the list of Grand Lodge
Officers each year, with the exception of
two, viz 1899/1900 and 1900/1.


The holding of a Floral Lodge was an in-
stitution peculiar to Lodge Samaritan. The
credit of the inauguration of this Lodge ap-
pears to belong to the late Wor. Bro. Liggins,
as the first event of this kind was held on the
2nd November, 1887, when a paper on “Flowers
and their teachings in connection with
Masonry” was read by this worthy Brother.
In the circular issued by Bro. Secretary each
Brother was requested to wear a buttonhole
and to bring a bouquet of flowers, which would
be forwarded to one of the hospitals on the
following morning. In the next year (1888)
the event was carried out on a larger scale, the
Pro. Grand Master and other distinguished
Brethren being present. On this occasion Wor.
Bro. Liggins delivered a lecture on “Masonic
lessons drawn from the Vegetable Kingdom,”
and the choir rendered a number of musical
items. There was a profusion of flowers,
which were duly forwarded in the morning to
the hospitals.
It remained, however, for Wor. Bro. Part-
ridge to go one better, and the pride and grati-
fication shown at the ultimate result finds
expression in the following very complete


record entered in the minutes of 16th October,
1890, by the Secretary, Bro. Patrick;—
"The Wor. Master, Wor. Bro. Partridge, stated
that there was no business on the paper for the
night, the object of the meeting being to hold
the Annual Floral Lodge. He would close the
Lodge and ask the Officers of the Lodge and the
Wor. Brethren on the dais to remain in their
places whilst the Brethren on the floor of the
Lodge brought in the ladies.”
“After the Lodge was closed the Officers and
the Wor. Brethren on the Dais, as requested by
the Wor. Master, remained in their seats and
the ladies were brought in and seated in two
rows of chairs extending right round the Lodge
room. The Worshipful Master in a happy speech
welcomed the ladies and visitors to the Samaritan
Lodge, and explained that the Floral Lodge was
held every year and always proved a great suc-
cess, but it seemed to him unfair that those to
whom we were indebted for that success should
not participate in the pleasure derived from the
result of their arduous labours. It was therefore
decided that the ladies should be introduced to
the Lodge Room, and the result spoke for itself
and exceeded his expectations.
"The Wor. Master then in an able manner
explained to the ladies and those visitors who
were not members of the Craft the higher aims
and objects of Freemasonry, and that the flowers
then giving such a beautiful effect to the Lodge
room would on the following morning be sent
to the various hospitals.


FLORAL LODGE ROOM, 1890
(LOOKING FROM DAIS)


“Rt, Wor. Bro. C. F. Stokes, D.G.M., replied
on behalf of the Grand Bodge and thanked the
Wor. Master and Brethren for the great treat
they had afforded himself and the officers of the
Grand Bodge. He had never seen anything so
beautiful in the way of Lodge Room decoration,
and the finishing touch was given by the intro-
duction of the ladies in their charming ballroom
dresses. The idea of introducing the ladies he
considered a step in the right direction and
would go far to break down that prejudice which
the fair sex sometimes entertained to our Order.
An adjournment was then made to the large
Hall, where dancing was kept up until the small
hours.”
A search of the records fails to disclose any
trace of the communication subsequently re-
ceived from the Grand Master bearing on these
proceedings, but it is known that its terms
have precluded any further assemblies of this
nature.
On the 14th October, 1891, in Wor. Bro.
McLean's year as Wor. Master, the Most Wor.
Bro. Earl Jersey, the Grand Master and the
Officers of Grand Lodge were present at the
annual floral lodge. However, in the absence
of those fairest of all flowers, with which Wor.
Bro. Partridge and Bro. Patrick had once
graced our Lodge room, interest appears to
have waned, and the last Floral Lodge seems
to have been held on xBth October, 1897, in
Wor. Bro. Kyngdon’s year.


Lodge Samaritan was amongst the earliest
of the Lodges to raise the musical ceremonies
to a high standard. In xBBi, the Lodge, being
anxious to add to the beauties of the ceremony,
subscribed a sum of £23/12/- for the purchase
of a harmonium, and on the 2nd August, 1881,
the first organist was appointed, viz., Wor.
Bro. Willson.
In 1883 a Glee Club was established, and the
Worshipful Master is found urging this as a
reason why a Brother should continue his
membership of the Lodge, “as the monthly
meetings are now much more sociable upon
this account.” The moving spirit and leader in
this connection was the late Wor. Bro. Liggins.
This was followed, in January, 1884, by the
appointment to the Office of Director of
Musical Ceremonies of a Brother who appears
to have entered upon the duties with some vim,
for in the following November we find him
writing to the Wor. Master urging the expen-
diture of not less than £SO upon the purchase
of a piano and the building of a pipe organ at
an estimated cost of £125. This Brother was


WOR. BRO. W. H. MCLEAN. P.G.S.
(TREASURER, 1893-1913)


William H. McLean, the present Treasurer of
the Lodge, and it is evident to the Brethren
that he had less anxiety for the funds
of the Lodge in his younger days than in his
more matured years. A digression here is
surely pardonable to say that Wor. Bro.
McLean has filled the position of Treasurer of
this Lodge since 1893 — an unbroken term of
upwards of twenty years, and altogether he has
held office for a continuous period of nearly
thirty years. That he may be spared to carry
on his good work for marry years to come is the
earnest wish of all the Brethren.
On the resignation of Bro. Willson as
Organist, the Wor. Master, according to
minutes of meeting of 4th February, 1885,
stated that “he had offered the position to Bro.
Joseph Massey, who, he was now pleased to
inform the Lodge, had accepted, and he felt
sure that in Bro. Massey’s hands the Musical
Ritual would be well carried out.” Prophetic
words! Bro. Massey has now occupied this
office for 28 years on end, and has most effi-
ciently contributed to the musical harmony and
the social enjoyment of the Brethren of this
Lodge. There have thus been but two
organists in Samaritan Lodge.


Under the English Constitution the Wor.
Master was elected by ballot, and he then
selected his officers. This seemingly gave him
a greater hold over them than under present
conditions, as, for example, we find the follow-
ing letter addressed to a Junior Warden in
1885 : —
“Dear Sir and Brother,
The Wor. Master has instructed me
to ask you to at once communicate to him the
cause of your absence from your position in Lodge
as Junior Warden at our meeting on Wednesday
evening last, as also the reason of his not having
been apprised of the fact before the meeting
took place.”
In the early days of this Lodge emergency
meetings were called by circular for the pur-
pose of instruction. The matter is thus re-
ferred to in the Secretary’s report for 1881
“Lodges of Instruction have been inaugurated
and have given general satisfaction. The matter
is of such importance in the education of Masons
that too much attention cannot be given thereto
from the Wor, Master in the Chair down to the
newly-invested Master Mason, not only for the
regular working of the Lodge, but in practising


Bro. JOSEPH MASSEY
(ORGANIST.1885-1913)


the proper mode of entering and leaving the
same. It cannot be too strongly impressed upon
the Brethren that they should strive to excel
in carrying out our rites perfectly and in strict
uniformity.”
In September, 1892, the consent of this
Lodge to the establishment of a regular Lodge
of Instruction at North Sydney was secured
at the instance of Wor. Bro, W. H. McLean,
who was its first Preceptor. This Lodge has
been maintained in active operation ever since,
and many Masons owe much to its teachings.
THE SOCIAL SIDE.
Having referred to the musical ceremonies,
it is but fitting to make some mention of the
social side of the Lodge. The Brethren have
never been wanting in their entertainment of
visitors; indeed, a perusal of some of the cor-
respondence shows that, from the Treasurer’s
point of view, they were on occasions over
lavish.
Numerous balls and entertainments have
been held from time to time. Probably the
most important event of this nature arranged
by this Lodge was the Grand Masonic Festival
in Regalia, held on 23rd July, 1886, in the


Masonic Hall, St. Leonard’s, to commemorate
the jubilee of Her Most Gracious Majesty
Queen Victoria, at which His Excellency the
Governor (Past Grand Warden of England)
and Lady Carrington were present, as also the
Right Wor. the District Grand Master and
Officers of the District Grand Lodge (E.C.).
The Hon. Secretaries were Bros. R. C.
Brindley and T. B. Dibbs, and the Treasurer,
Bro. J. St. V. Welch.
A well established fixture was the annual
cricket match with Lodge Empress of India.
In the earlier years it took the form of a day’s
outing, generally to Sir Joseph Banks' grounds;
each match was keenly contested, and gave the
Brethren much enjoyment. The last match
of the series was played at North Sydney on
the 4th April, 1908, and it is still a bone of con-
tention as to with whom the honors rest.
There is no such doubt in regard to a match
played against Lodge Rawson, on 18th March,
1911, when our Brethren achieved a great
victory.
A pleasing social event in recent times was
the occasion upon which a re-union of the


SAMARITAN v, EMPRESS OF INDIA
(HIGH TIME)


Brethren of the Lodges in the Northern
Suburbs was held on nth October, 1910, in
the Masonic Hall, North Sydney, eight Lodges
being represented, viz., Samaritan, St. John
(Manly), St. Leonards, Hunter’s Hill, Mosman,
Kuring-gai (Chatswood), Rawson (Gore Hill)
and Hornsby.
CONCLUSION.
The details so far given relate mostly to
happenings prior to the nineties, and the re-
cords have not been carried further, as they
may be regarded as current events which may
be left to other hands to transcribe when time
has rolled a little further on. The day, how-
ever, fast approaches when our Lodge room,
so full of historic associations, will have to be
given up, and we must find accommodation
elsewhere. Most of us first saw Masonic light
within these walls, and there have we met in
the closest bonds of brotherly love and friend-
ship, while ties have been formed and cemented
which shall remain so long as life continues.
In conclusion those beautiful lines so often
rendered at our meetings to the setting of
Mozart may be appropriately quoted:—


Within these halls time hallow’d
Must hearts grow still and calm,
Whilst hate and envy banished,
Comes love with holy balm.
Here hands are joined in friendship’s grasp,
And feuds forgotten in the clasp,
Give place to kindly words and deeds,
And thoughtful care for other’s needs.
Within these walls time hallow’d
Man greets his fellow man.
Where love is ever watchful
No fear of Treach’ry’s ban.
And hearts that here no pleasure find
Have left the best of life behind,
For most of good that man befalls
Is found within these hallow’d walls.
