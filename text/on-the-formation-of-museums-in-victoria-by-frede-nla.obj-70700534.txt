PRINTED BY GOODHUGH & HOUGH, 48, FLINDERS LANE EAST.
1867.


This Paper was drawn up last year for an evening meeting of one
of the Societies in the Town. In publishing it now, I have drawn
my pen through some passages, and added others, in accordance
with the progress of events.


MUSEUMS, &c.
The use of Museums, as a means of conveying valuable
practical information to the masses of the public, has only of
late years been perceived by the British people; and it is
only recently that the British Government has imitated the
course pursued by the rulers of all the civilized states of
Europe and America, and established Government Museums
of Practical and Applied Science in the three Kingdoms.*
Very many of even the better informed classes cling to the
old notion of a Museum being, at best, a place merely for
innocent amusement of schoolboys and idlers; a place, like
Shakspeare?s Apothecary?s shop, where
? a tortoise hung,
An alligator stuff?d, and other skins
Of ill-shaped fishes?
might be gaped at, and where such other dusty odds and ends
as stray contributors might give, should be locked in cases,
without labels or classification, or other essentials, to make
them useful. In fact, the more incomprehensible the objects,
the better, in the estimation of the lovers of these old-fashioned
? raree shows; and it is only within the last few years that
our countrymen are beginning to find out that, under proper
direction, and as managed in modern times. Museums become
the most ready and effectual means of communicating the
knowledge and praactical experience of the experienced few,
to the many who, under less favourable circumstances, are
engaged in, or mean to enter upon, those useful pursuits of
life which depend more or less directly upon a knowledge of
* Under the titles of Museum of Practical Geology, Government School of
Mines and Science applied to the Arts, Museum of Economic Geology, Museum
of Irish Industrial Resources, Museum of the School of Fine Arts, &c;


the peculiarities of the raw materials which Nature furnishes
to us.
It has been suggested to me me that, as some even of our
scientific fellow-colonists held these old notions, a few observa-
tions on modern Museums in general, and suggestions for
the formation of such as would be useful to the people of this
colony, might prove acceptable; and I have accordingly put
the few following notes together, placing them under separate
heads, for convenience of reference.
GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.
All the more enlightened nations of Europe have long
found it profitable to vote annually considerable sums for the
prosecution of scientific researches, and the maintenance, in
all the principal towns, of Museums, in which the eye of the
unlearned could be familiarised with natural objects, as well
as with the principles of classification applied to them by
scientific men to plac* their peculiar characters and mutual
relations in a striking light; and with specimens and models
of machinery illustrative of the arts and manufactures.
Such Museums, more or less good, exist, endowed from
the public purse, in nearly all the large University Towns of
the Continent of Europe; such establishments the United
States have been organising at great expense, in connection
with the Government Natural History and Geological Sur-
veys, during the last twelve or fourteen years; and such the
Board of Trade have more tardily established at home with
the most gratifying success.
For Victoria, I have no doubt that, with slight modifica-
tions, the series of Museums established by the British Board
of Trade would form the best precedents. They may be
divided into Museums of Natural Science, with its applica-
tions, and Museums of Art. Although these are partially
combined in many cases, yet the division is useful, and I
shall treat the two kinds separately.
MUSEUMS OF NATURAL AND APPLIED SCIENCES.
These have for their object the exhibition to the public of
examples of all the natural products of the earth, or particular
parts of it, carefully labelled with name, the locality whence
obtained, and such other information as would indicate
the nature or uses of the particular object. And as every
country possesses natural resources with which it is the


interest of the community to be acquainted, it has been recog-
nised as an imperative duty by all intelligent governments,
to have surveys and collections made by competent persons
of all such things, and to have the results of such investiga-
tions, whether specimens of the animal, vegetable, onnineial
kingdoms, deposited in some scientific establishment, wheie
they could be carefully preserved for public instruction, and
be freely open to public inspection, and where they should
remain for verification, in after times, of the data on which
the various Government Reports, &c., were founded.^
The Victorian Government initiated measures of this kind
long ago, and by His Excellency, Mr. Latrobe, a Government
Botanist (Hr. Muller) was appointed to collect all the plants
of the district, and report on those furnishing timber fit for
various purposes, and those affording the various valuable
gums, dyes, medicines, tannin, 6cc., which it might be ex-
pected the plants of the country would yield to the manufac-
turer acquainted with their appearance and properties. A
Government Zoologist (Mr. Blandowski) was appointed to
collect the animals, &c. A Government Geologist (Mr.
Sclwyn) was appointed, and brought out from England, to
examine and report upon the rocks of the country, and to
combine his observations into a geological map, to be pub-
lished by the survey department; to make such a geological
survey as the Board of Trade is having made for the United
Kingdom, in connection with the School of Mines and
Museum of Economic Geology in London; or such as Pro-
fessors Hall, Rodgers, Emmons, &c., are doing for the United
States, or such as Haidinger is superintending at Vienna for
the Austrian Government.
Having been myself, many years ago, a member of the Geolo-
gical Survey of Great Britain, which is the finest in the world,
I am in a position to speak of the first-class excellence of the
work already performed by our Government Geologist, and
to say, that the map and sections now preparing for publica-
tion, are such as any country might be proud of: they are on
the same plan as those of the British Survey, and are quite
worthy of being placed beside them. The extent of country
surveyed by him is also remarkable, when the difficulties under
which he laboured, from having so small a staff, and insufficient
topographical maps, are considered.
The Surveyor-General, too, with that zealous love of applied
science, and skill in command, by which work of extraordi-
nary goodness is got out of ordinary workmen, which has
made his corps so famous at home and abroad; he, too, has


made great and useful collections for the public, of the rocks,
building stones, ores, soils, &c. of this country; which col-
lections could he increased to any extent without appre-
ciable cost to the Government, by directing the attention
of the surveyors to those matters which necessarily come
under their notice in the daily discharge of their field duty.
All these works, accumulating the materials for a
National Museum, were commenced long ago by the
Victorian Government, and are continued to the present day.
I am also informed that, two or three years ago, the Govern-
ment had determined to appoint a Director of the Museum,
in accordance with the system pursued at home in the great
national museums to which I have alluded. This officer has
been found by experience to be absolutely necessary for the
satisfactory carrying out of the objects of such institutions.
At home the office is always filled by some man of established
reputation and varied scientific knowledge?Haidinger, the
great mineralogist, for instance, has been appointed by the
Emperor, Director of the Vienna Museum; Prince Charles
Lucien Buonaparte, one of the most accomplished of living
naturalists, has been appointed Director of the Paris Museum;
Sir Henry De la Beche, and, at his death, Sir Roderick
Murchison, received the appointment of Director of the
London Museum of Practical Geology, with its branches of
Natural History and School of Mines. Sir Robert Kane is
Director of the Government Museum of Irish Industrial
Resources, including the Survey Natural History Collections,
and it was understood that the corresponding office in Scotland
was to have been filled by the late Professor E. Forbes, in con-
nection with his Professorship of Natural Sciences in the Edin-
burgh University. Within the last few months it has been
found absolutely necessary to create this office in the British
Museum, and Professor Owen is now the head of the whole,
and combines the labours of the many admirable naturalists
there engaged on the elaboration of the different depart-
ments. It is to be regretted that this office was not
filled up at the time, as from the known zeal of the gentle-
man indicated to me as at that time willing to undertake the
duties, we might now have had the advantages of a harmonious
action between all those branches of the public service, able to
advance the end in view; and by a judicious direction of each
into the proper channels of inquiry, and impartiality and skill
in dealing with the results of the various labours for the public
benefit, the various materials really obtained might have been
combined into a valuable public collection.


A serious obstacle to the formation hitherto in Victoria
of a great National Museum, was the want of a suitable
building to hold the specimens. The town having now, how-
ever, the large Museum, built by the University expressly
for the purpose of containing the Government natural
science collections, removes this obstacle to the bringing the
scattered fragments of collections together ; and although
we have as yet no complete Museum, it will be seen that
we have the materials for a great and good one, and un-
usually favourable opportunities for completing it on the most
approved plans.
� a. BOTANICAL MUSEUM.
Collections for the exhibition of classically arranged plants
are of two sorts: Ist, Botanic Gardens for living specimens;
2nd, Herbaria for dried plants. Both kinds should be fos-
tered; and accordingly both kinds have already made consi-
derable progress in Victoria.
The public Botanic Gardens,under the able superintendence
of Mr. Dalachy, afford the citizens the most delightful prome-
nades, amongst well kept flower borders, trim walks, a rich col-
lection of flowering shrubs and herbaceous plants, and the most
beautifully situated piece of landscape gardening that can be
conceived in this country. But as here (very properly I think)
beauty of arrangement has been permitted to dominate over the
grim precision and gridiron-like order of a strictly scientific
Botanic Gardens for class purposes, I have been furnished by
the Council of the University with means for the formation
of a Botanic Garden of this latter kind, which is now being
laid out; and with the help of Mr. Dalachy, and many other
public and private rearers of plants, who have promised their
aid, we expect to have within the year a good collection,
illustrative of all the natural Classes , Orders, and most of the
Families, and many of the Genera of plants, arranged with the
systematic precision of the leaves of a book, and fully labelled
in the way adopted by my friends Professor Henslow and Mr.
Babington in the new University Botanic Garden at Cam-
bridge. Each Class having a large bed to itself, with a label
bearing its name in the centre, of such a size, that it can be
read from any part of the margin: this bed is divided by
small fences into smaller divisions, containing each one of the
subordinate Orders of the Class, these again being subdivided
into Families; and these into compartments for the Genera ;


each subordinate division in the classification being marked by a
conspicuous, but progressively smaller, label, until finally the
Species placed in each generic compartment have ordinary
sized labels, setting forth the Genus, Species, Locality, and
common name of each. A garden well labelled in this manner
will teach the principles of botanical classification, even if but
poorly furnished with plants, and the eye of the visitor will
familiarise him insensibly with the natural alliances and affi-
nities of the various groups of plants, and suggest the relations
which the scientific botanists have detected and used for their
classification, even when as yet we may be deficient in many
of the typical specimens. These, I have every hope, however,
will not long be wanting.
The Government Herbarium, collected principally by JDr.
Muller, contains a collection of dried specimens of great value,
of most of the native plants of Victoria. This hitherto has
been tied up in bundles, and kept in the little cottage in the
Botanic Garden, where the workmen took their meals and
slept, and where, consequently, visitors would scarcely like
to intrude. It has now been transferred by the Commis-
sioner of Public Works to the University, where it will be
most carefully preserved, as the original specimens on which
the printed reports of Dr. Muller were founded. It has
just undergone a thorough repair, I having found living
larv�e half an inch long, and numerous minute destructive
Termes, Psoci, and the like, ruinously at work in the first
parcel which came under ray care. We are having a suitable
case made for its reception in the new University Museum,
where it will be soon ready for reference. The University
gardener is forming a supplementary Herbarium of the intro-
duced plants, including those coming into flower in the Bo-
tanic and other gardens. Mr. Wilhelmi, the assistant Govern-
ment botanist, will furnish us with a suite of his South
Australian plants. I have just secured a good British Her-
barium; the Boston Natural History Society has given a
small collection of American plants, and I have written home
for an extensive Herbarium of the plants of other countries
for comparison.
A museum of this sort should have, however, in ad-
dition to the above, a well-prepared suite of preparations
and dissections, illustrating all the parts of plants, exam-
ples of all the tissues, the organs, with their more
striking modifications of development in flower and fruit.
All the structural peculiarities which have received par-
ticular names in the writings of botanists, should be illus-


trated by typical prepared examples, to which full descrip-
tive labels should be attached, so as to clear, as much as pos-
sible, difficulties from the way of persons entering upon the
study. A still more serious defect in the present public
botanic collection, in the mind of one who likes to see science
applied to the useful purposes of life, is the absence of speci-
mens of the useful vegetable products of the colony. It is
of importance to the community to have publicly exhibited
examples of all our native woods, from the timber excellent
for shipbuilding, and those good for house carpentry, and of
special utility for certain parts of machines, to our most
beautiful black-wood, and other rich sorts, for fine cabinet-
makers? work; the latter in manufactured and polished pieces.
We should also have well-prepared specimens of the tannin
from our bark; our indigo and other dyestuffs, our gums and
other medicinal products, should appear as they might be
prepared for the market. Sir W. Denison?s experience of the
facility with which potash can be manufactured from the
ashes of our forest trees, should be illustrated by samples of
the prepared alkali of the ash, and of the timber it was from,
with descriptive labels. It would be the duty of a ?Director
of the Museum? to see that such specimens as these were pro-
cured and exhibited, for though of the highest interest to the
public, they are almost sure to be neglected by the enthusi-
astic scientific collector, because no scientific interest attaches
to them, and such observers, led away by the desire for no-
velty and many distinct species, are apt to forget that these
are but the means to an end,and that those ?merely useful?
matters, instead of being neglected, should be brought pro-
minently forward.
� h. ZOOLOGICAL MUSEUM.
Zoological Museums are either local or general: the first
being as complete a series of species as possible of some par-
ticular locality; the latter being principally generic types
from all parts of the world.
It unfortunately happens in this, as in other depart-
ments of science, that the showy and useless have received
more attention than the apparently insignificant creatures
that for good or for evil most concern mankind. Thus
the natural history of Birds has usurped a most undue
share of attention: Quadrupeds have been less studied
or collected; and some of the more economically important
lower groups are almost unknown. Thus there is scarcely a


moderately perfect collection of Fishes in existence, although
the fisheries of various countries are of such high import-
ance to man. Scarce a year passes but some of the German
princes expend a large part of their income to fee scientific
commissioners to examine and report upon some of the mi-
nute beetles, or other insect destroyers of their pine forests,
although if the museums were supplied with the small and
ugly creatures as abundantly as with the showy ones-, the in-
sects would long ago have been perfectly well known to every
entomologist of Europe. Sir Win. Denison figures and describes
the Lymnoria terebrans, a little crustacean no bigger than a pin?s
head, which he convicted of the destruction of the sub-marine
piles in Tasmania while he was Governor there, and which a
less acute observer might have supposed to have simply
rotted ; yet, so inveterate is the habit of collecting only
pretty things for museums, that this creature is almost un-
known in Europe, where it has been described by three dif-
ferent observers under three different names. This same
little creature is the Mylostoma of Allman, which destroys
the wooden piers on the Irish coasts, and Della Chiagi had
long before described it at similar mischief on the piers of the
Two Sicilies. Then, again, when the Hessian fly appeared
first in numbers in Europe, and a famine was dreaded from
the destruction it occasioned to the wheat crops, there was
scarcely a museum in Europe contained a specimen, and the
creature was supposed to be unknown, simply because then,
as now, it was not the fashion to collect the smaller Diptera.
The fly which kills the vine?the fly which destroys the
turnip crops by eating the two first young leaves?and, in
fact, the great majority of the insect annual destroyers of
millions worth of property, are rarely to be met with in
museums. Here, again, is another instance of the necessity
of having always a Director at the head of any publicly en-
dowed Museum, independent of the collectors; for the latter
say, with some reason, that they must make up a show, or
the oi mA/.o\ will think them idle; and if they looked after
these matters, a year?s collecting might fit in a hat, and they
might lose their situations. A superior officer, to come be-
tween them and judgment, is, therefore, necessary. The
known Mollusca ( Teredo ), Crustacea {Lymnoria), and insects
most destructive to property, whether growing crops or manu-
factured timber, one of each, put together, would fit in a
wine glass ; yet, for the public service, it is far more neces-
sary that they should be collected and investigated than all
the most brilliant birds and butterflies the world ever saw.


As for our local collection, I have already alluded to the
beginning made by the Government Zoologist, principally
rich in birds and mammals. All the fishes of our coasts and
rivers should, however, be quickly collected, those good for
food,or poisonous, ascertained; their habits, times of migration,
&c., investigated, and registered in catalogues referring to a
perfect suite of specimens preserved according to the Cornish
plan lately adopted in the British Museum.* The shells,
corals, echinoderms, &c., of the coast should also be zealously
collected, from their important bearing upon the geological
data for determining from Palaeontology the age of the newer
form ations of this country. On these latter, if faithfully
labelled with their exact localities, depends the solution of
some fundamental problems touching the influence of geogra-
phical distribution on the similarity of the fossil I aunae of
geological formations in widely separated localities, supposed
to be of one age. These collections have still to be made,
the shells in the collection being chiefly dead, worn speci-
mens, apparently picked up on the beach, and without labels,
localities, and notice of depth or kind of water, or any of the
other essentials to make them useful. All the conchological
specimens should be fixed down to thin boards in the positions
most suitable for showing the characters, and with their labels
attached as in the Paris and London National Museums, so
that no confusion may ever arise from misplacement. The
Victorian insects'have scarcely been touched by the Govern-
ment collectors, but I have secured for the University a fine
series as a commencement, selected from the beautiful and
extensive collections of Victorian insects made by Mr. H.
Edwards and Mr. Kershaw, for their own use. These local
zoological collections should by all means be continued and
made approximately perfect, by the continuance of the annual
grant, voted for the last few years, for a little longer; and
illustrated reports should be published from time to time
on the plan of the Government Natural History Surveys of
the United States, but on a smaller and more economical
scale. In granting sums of money for the collection and in-
vestigation of the natural products of the colony, the mem-
bers of the Legislature have shown a great and wise liber-
ality ; but in doing so they have voted nothing for books, and
* Since the Government Survey collection came into my charge at the
University I have made a good beginning, and, hy mere purchase at the fish
shops, have already got together the more common species ; and I have
instructed the Taxidermist in the method of preserving them above recom-
mended.


for the specimens of other countries necessary for
comparison to enable the investigators to ascertain the name
and nature of the local specimens. As well might you expect
to understand the politics of one European state without
reference to the acts and laws of the others, as attempt to
investigate the natural products of a colony without at least
certain typical specimens from all the other parts of the world.
This oversight I have imperfectly endeavoured to rectify by
laying out the whole of the money placed at my disposal by
the University for Natural History collections, exclusively in
the purchase of specimens of other countries, illustrating all
the classical divisions of the science as a whole, embracing, in
the first instance, types of all the Classes, Orders, Families,
and as many Genera as possible, so that the public may have
an opportunity of acquiring enlarged views of classifica-
tion and affinity, and learn the scientific mode of approaching
the study of the subject. Taking it for granted that the
Survey collections would illustrate all the Victorian species,
I have thus secured the systematic skeleton, as it were, of a
public collection of the best kind for instruction, and which
may become indefinitely large by the addition of species
which will all naturally come at once into the systematic
groups indicated for them. My department of the University
Library will also soon be rich in English and foreign techni-
cal scientific works required by the colonial naturalist, and
at present the public can freely consult there many of the
more important works in natural history not to be seen else-
where in the country.
� C. GEOLOGICAL MUSEUMS.
Geological investigations can never be carried on with pre-
cision even by the most habile observers, without reference
to Museums of Rocks, Minerals, and Fossils, and in a country
like this, where mining pursuits are so important, and where
the intelligence of the masses of the people is so much above
the average, it is of greater importance than elsewhere to
have a well-arranged collection open to the people, where
they can learn to recognise by the eye those rocks, ofes, and
characteristic fossils which they may have read, and formed
dim notions, of from books, but which it is necessary for the
successful prosecution of this pursuit, that they should be
able to recognise at sight when they meet them under the
various aspects of the different varieties.
The only Geological collections as yet made by the


Government in Victoria are purely local, and as Victoria
affords examples but of few of the known geological forma-
tions, such collections could give only narrow and imperfect
views of the science. As soon, however, as it was made
known to me that the public geological collections, made by
the Government geologist while making his survey of the
country, were to be exhibited at the University, I at once
turned all the University funds at my disposal for Geological
purposes, to what I considered the greatest public good, by
purchasing such specimens from other countries as were re-
quired in conjunction Avith the Survey specimens, to give a
connected systematic view of the science as a whole. With
this view I purchased a nearly complete collection of all the
known species of minerals, containing upAvards of 2000 speci-
mens from all the celebrated localities in Europe and America.
These are now exposed in the University Museum in glass
cases, and I am having them labelled distinctly on a more
instructive plan than I have seen elseAvhere. The main col-
lection I have arranged upon the electro-chemical plan last
suggested by Berzelius, and adopted by all the best continen-
tal authorities, in Avhich the groups are formed by allowing
the greatest consideration to the electro-negative constituents;
but I shall shortly arrange a secondary collection of duplicates
on the more ordinary plan of English and American Avriters,
grouping the species according to the bases; so that in one
collection the observer will find all the oxides, all the carbon-
ates, or all the sulphides, &c., together; while, if he Avants to
see all the ores of iron, or copper, or all the salts of lime, or
barytes, &c., in groups by themselves, he will examine the
other series. Both collections are being labelled Avith tickets
on which I have had a form printed, having a line at top for
the name, then one headed ? Form,? on which the crystalline
system of the mineral, and often the angle characteristic of
the species, are written; then follows a line headed ? Com-
position,? on which the essential constituents or chemical
composition of the species are Avritten in chemical symbols ;
and lastly, the locality. Thus the specimen and label teach
all the essentials of each mineral Avithout reference to a book.
This plan I hope to see generally adopted. As the Avriting
the composition of the minerals in chemical symbols might
seem unsuited to the popular eye, I should explain that I
have had an alphabetical list of the letters used as symbols
of the 63 simple substances of which all things are com-
posed, written in large hand and hung up in the room with
the specimens, so that any one ignorant of the subject can


with a glance of the eye decipher the symbols and ascer-
tain the composition of any mineral for themselves.
The fossils collected by the geological survey of Victoria
have been lately placed in my hands, and I have placed
them in glass cases in a room of the Museum of the Univer-
sity devoted to Government Victorian specimens, adopting
the plan of ? Local groups,? in accordance with the method
of the American States Surveys, which I think is best calcu-
lated to illustrate, and assist in unravelling, the geology of a
new country.
� d. MUSEUM OF ECONOMIC GEOLOGY AND SCHOOL
OF MINES.
When giving evidence before the Gold Committee of the
Legislative Council I suggested the formation in Melbourne
of a ? Mining Museum,? like those of the Russian, Ger-
man, French, and London ? Schools of Mines,? for the pur-
pose of affording ? eye-knowledge? to a class of persons who
have neither time nor opportunity for lengthened study of
books; and on explaining the constitution and uses of such a
Museum to persons landing here on their way to the mining
districts, the Government, with the alacrity which I have
always found them display in forwarding the practical edu-
cation of the people, authorised me to make a commence-
ment of such a Museum in accordance with the recom-
mendation of that committee. Already excellently executed
working models, made of the true materials and accurately to
scale of some of the best mining machinery of the Bendigo
gold-fields, have been constructed for the use of the public
in one of the suites of rooms built by the University as a
public Museum. The complete ? Museum of Economic
? Geology and School of Mines,? on the European type,
which I hope to see well advanced here in a year or two, em-
braces the following features:?ln the first place all the rocks
of the country, plainly labelled, should be procured and
arranged, with references corresponding to the geological
map, which should hang up in close proximity to the speci-
mens, so that the inquirer may see in what parts of the
colony any particular rock occurs, and over what extent and
line of country it extends. The members of the Geological
Survey, and some members of the Topographical Survey, are
rapidly forming this part of the collection,|by sending in
specimens from their localities to the University, where my
assistant labels them in his spare time* All the stones of the


colony which seem fit for building purposes are procured in
cubic blocks of six inches, the faces being cut, polished, or
dressed by the stone masons in six different ways, exactly
according with the pattern adopted by the English Commis-
sioners appointed to enquire into the subject of Building
stones for the new Houses of Parliament at Westminster.
The collection of the commissioners just alluded to, increased
by additional examples of the same size and pattern, forms
now a most useful part of the National Museum of Economic
Geology and School of Mines in Jermyn-street, London,
and similar collections are, by order of the Government, being
made by the surveyors in Ireland and Scotland. Experience
has shown in those countries the great advantage of having,
when public buildings are to be erected, some public depart-
ment where all the building stones of the country can be
seen together, with the way in which each receives the tool-
ing or dressing of the mason, and the geological map to
show which kind may be obtained near the locality of the
proposed building, so that the most advantageous choice may
be made. It is now also the practice frequently to refer
public contractors to the national collection of samples in
specifications, and in this way references are obtained for
labels on the specimens to public buildings made of each, and
information as to durability of different kinds obtained. It
is only necessary for me to allude to these facts concerning
the importance of these collections in the old country, to show
how very much more important they would be to us here,
where great wealth and rapidly increasing population are
combining to create now so many, and fine, public buildings.
Some of our fine city buildings are already crumbling to
decay from the exfoliation of the soft concretionary sandstone
of which they are built; while in all the world there is no
finer granite, for durability and every other good quality,
than that of Mt. Eliza in our Bay, where inexhaustible
quantities may be quarried within a few hundred feet
of the water?s edge, giving the easiest and cheapest
possible carriage into the town, and yet the fact seems
unknown to builders, and the stone is not used. The Go-
vernment have authorised me to get a series of these samples
of building stones cut, and dressed as above, to be de-
posited in the Museum for the use of the public, and several
of them may now be seen in the western room of the Museum
at the University. With the aid of the Commissioner of
Public Works, a pattern sample of the stone of every public
building in the colony could be regularly deposited here.


The President of the Road Board (Dr. Murphy) has ex-
pressed his willingness to furnish us also with the specifica-
tion samples of the various road metals used, approved or not,
throughout the colony. So also the joint exhibition of map
and specimens will show the localities and appearances of
Victorian stones useful for other purposes; as our few lime-
stones; and our tertiary nodules fit for manufacture of cement,
?thousands of tons of which are to be had close at hand,
although we are yearly sending I know not what large sums
of money to England for exactly the same material.
Samples of all the metallic ores, not only of the colony, but
of all parts of the world, that they may be known when met
with, form the next grand feature of ? a Mining or Economic
Geological Museumand with each should be exhibited
samples of all the stages of the processes to which it is sub-
jected to render it useful in the arts and manufactures. Then
should follow models of mining and other machinery con-
nected with the economic history of the natural products as
used in all parts of the world, and samples of the smaller
tools, &c. of the best, and also of the common and defective,
or objectionable make, for comparison. I have mentioned
that the Government has already enabled me to procure several
of the tools and models of mining machines in use in Vic-
toria, and I hope soon to be able to exhibit in the Museum
exact working models of the gold, diamond, and platina
washing machines of the Russian Imperial Mines; tools and
models of the machines used in the copper and tin districts of
Cornwall, &c. &c. The various earths and stones proper for
making bricks, pottery, china, and glass, follow, with examples
of the manufactures from each, with models of the various
furnaces and other necessary arrangements employed in the
most successful working establishments of the old countries.
And so on through the various exemplifications of the modes
of utilising the raw materials around us, as in similar esta-
blishments at home in which I took an interest.
� e. AGRICULTURAL MUSEUM.
On my recommendation, a beginning has been already
made by the Government and by the University, to form an
establishment of this kind, like the Museum of Economic
Botany formed by my friend Professor Henslow at Kew, which
has been accepted as the best type by the principal museums
for showing the application of science to Agriculture in


Britain and on the Continent. For many years the Univer-
sities of France and Belgium and North America have had
chairs of Agriculture, and the late Sir Robert Peel, when
engaged in founding the Queen?s Colleges in Ireland, intro-
duced the subject for the first time into the teaching of a
British University, with a success which has led to the for-
mation of numerous Agricultural Colleges in England, where
the Universities omit such studies. Our University has al-
ready mooted the establishment of an agricultural course of
education, in which the University Lectures on Chemistry,
Geology, and Animal and Vegetable Structures, would come
in as they do in the Agricultural courses in the Colleges al-
luded to, and I believe the Government would willingly aid
the formation ofa model farm (with a resident superintendent,
to teach the field operations, the use of tools, and the treat-
ment of cattle,) which would be required along with the Lec-
tures and Museum, to diffuse a good knowledge of the modern
scientific agriculture; and if it had not been for those cheer-
ing prospects, I should not have thought it worth while to
attempt an Agricultural Museum, as all such are but
idle shows when divorced from their true use of aids in
teaching.
An Agricultural Museum should embrace, Ist, a complete
series of the soils and and subsoils of the country, collected
by the surveyors, and exhibited in square compartments, re-
presenting the squares or sheets of the general map of the
country, on the plan used by the Ordnance Survey at home;
each with its chemical analysis, stuck like a garden label in it,
and a reference to the rock from the disintegration of which it
?has been produced. Only a few of these have as yet been col-
lected. 2nd. As complete a series as possible of agricultural
seeds of the best growth, and specimens of the various grasses.
The pods, haulm, and straw for the farm-yard, and models
of the roots, tubers and fruit, too large to be preserved in
Goadby?s solution, which may have been grown with marked
success in the different districts; the chemical composition of
one of each group being affixed; and in every case of a finely
grown colonial sample of any vegetable production, the soil
in which it was grown should be placed beside it, labelled
with its analysis, so that the relation may be seen between the
constituents of the plant and the constituents of the soil, or
successful manure used for its full development. To show the
practical application of such combinations of specimens and
scientific observations, I may mention a case of a grower who,
learningthat fine wheat was rich in phosphates, manured his


wheat-fields richly with ground bones, and next year had the
finest crop of wheat, with the largest and best filled ears he had
ever seen; but, to his mortification, the whole crop was lost
before it was ripe, from the unexpected cause that the straw
was too small and weak to support the luxuriant heads, which
were all laid in consequence. Now an analysis exhibited of
straw would show that silica, or the material of quartz, flint,
or sand, is its most striking constituent, and the soil in ques-
tion being deficient in this material, the cause of the in-
sufficient development of the straw,* which defect a small addi-
tion of sand would have perfectly remedied. Again, to show
strikingly to the eye of the farmer the relative value of different
kinds of food, a model of a large potatoe, for instance, weigh-
ing so many ounces, would have its constituents displayed
beside it (in a way first suggested by my friend Professor
Plenslow, of Cambridge,) as, Ist, a large bottle of water, weigh-
ing nearly as much as the whole potatoe ; 2nd, a very small
bottle of charcoal, and the rest of the weight made up of a few
grains of less important matters! Then again, allusion has been
made to one of the numerous and valuable practical scientific
papers of Sir William Denison, suggesting the manufacture
in Tasmania of potash from the ashes of our gum trees.
Persons in other localities where gum trees grow adopting
the suggestion, might fall into a ruinous error for want of a
caution (which His Excellency did not think it necessary to
allude to in Tasmania), that the existence of potash in the
soil is essential to its appearance in the ashes of the tree, for
as my old friend. Sir Robert Kane, showed long ago, pines
and oaks which grew on granite and slate soils, yielded
abundance of potash in their ashes, hut the same trees when
grown on limestone soils yielded only lime instead. The advan-
tages of a National Museum collection of the analysed soils
of the colony referring to their distribution on the map, need
not, after these hints, be dilated on. The Committee of the
Port Phillip Farmers Society sent in this year the samples of
all the prize grain from their show; and if the samples exhi-
bited at the yearly Agricultural and Industrial Exhibitions,
were either presented to the Museum by the exhibitors, or
purchased in some cases, we could perpetuate the advantages
* The complaint in the Melbourne newspapers of farmers, north of the
city, that their poultry were laying eggs without shells, arises in reality from
the scarcity of lime in the soil, and may he remedied (as is known in similarly
circumstanced places at home) by leaving a lump of chalk for the hens to peck
at, or by mixing a little of it with their food, carbonate of lime forming most
of the hard part of the egg-shell.


of the exhibitions, which can now only be seen for a week,
and make the colonial part of the Museum with little cost or
trouble. In this Museum we should have examples (as
in the Mining Museum) of all the good tools in use in various
countries, and working models of all the improved modern
agricultural machines, accurately made to scale (so that an
ordinary mechanic could construct a machine from the model)
of England, America, and France ; models showing the appli-
cation of steam power to ploughing (or rather digging) and
other earth works, as well as in the new economical pipe-
distribution of liquid manure, &c. In no country in the
world is it so important that the best inventions in agricultural
machinery should be introduced ; and modern improvements
will be so evident to the eye of a practical man, from the col-
lection of models in our proposed Museum, that he can there
at once select the best that is known for his purpose. As in
Professor Henslow?s creation at Kew, we should have
examples of all the kinds of draining tiles and pipes ; speci-
mens showing the way in which they become filled by roots
of plants; models of the mode of construction of the different
forms and materials of drains suited to various local circum-
stances, &c. &c.
CONCLUDING REMARKS ON MUSEUMS OF NATURAL AND
APPLIED SCIENCES.
This paper has already extended to such a length, that I
shall only add an observation or two on the steps that have
been taken to carry into effect the suggestions I have mades
When the circumstances of this country sometime ago ren-
dered it desirable, in the opinion of Sir Charles Hotham, to
discontinue the Natural Science Collections, and to abolish
the Museum, as the house it occupied was required for
Survey offices, and the expense of a new one would not be
entertained, the Government offered to place the public
collections in the custody of the University, on the conditions
that they should remain the public property, and that the
University should erect, and fit with glass cases, a suitable
Museum, in which the present and future collections should
be freely exhibited to the public,?the University accepted
the trust, and with a liberality which has sorely pinched us
in other departments, has erected and'furnished a noble suite of
rooms, capable of indefinite extension, to contain these col-
lections, surrounded by enclosed grounds, so as to be com-


pletely free from the destructive dust of the town, and which
are open daily to the public. Both the Government and
the University recognised the mutual advantage of having
the colonial collections close to the general ones of the Un�
versity, as well as to the scientific books, the lecture rooms,
and, in the case of the Geological and Agricutural collec-
tions, to the Chemical laboratory.
MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS AND ANTIQUITIES.
The paper concluded with suggestions for the formation
of a Museum of this kind, by getting fron* the Sydenham
Palace Company copies of all the casts of classic statuary,
antiquities, and architectural decorations, which they have
received from all parts of Europe, and which, might be repro-
duced for us from the moulds which the Company has been
permitted to take of nearly every desirable model in the
princely collections of every city on the Continent (in many
cases where the like favour has been refused to crowned heads),
and which, at small comparative cost, would give us many of
the advantages of art-study at Borne or the other cities of
home, where the masterpieces of the old sculptors have
inspired the student for centuries. These casts might be
well displayed in the ground floor of the Public Library,
where, also, sulphur casts of the great European collections
of coins for historical studies, &c., would form the most ap-
propriate adjuncts to the works on Belles Lettres, fine arts,
architecture, and the like, in which that Library should be
especially rich, as the subjects do not enter into the Univer-
sity or other public libraries of the town.
Suggestions were also offered for the formation of a
museum of anatomy and pathology, to aid the medical and
surgical students, for whom the medical faculty is contem-
plated in the University. This museum, it was suggested,
should be placed in the new wing of the Hospital. �
