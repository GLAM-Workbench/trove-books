SIR,—
In offering you this booklet of verse, I am
anxious there should be a clear understanding between us.
Of course, X lay no claim to the Poet’s bays, lam but a
poor rhymer, who best compares himself to asmail fellow
creature of ours which we often see in a cage, with noth-
ing to recommend it either in its appearance, or powers
of song. But being caged, the captive must pipe its little
repertoire: if it didn’t it is probable its heart would
break. So I have rhymed in prison. Emerged from the
long and iniquitous imprisonment to which I have been
(as I assert), so wantonly subjected, it is necessary that
I should live. To live, because I wish to clear my name;
and because, after that, I am brave enough to think
there is still something like a future before me. There-
fore I shall be glad if this poor venture meet with your
encouragement.
I do not think it possible for any man to set himselt a
higher task than mine, 1 consider that X have given
yon, by every action of mine during my imprisonment,
and by the consistent position I maintain now that I am


TO THE RESPECTABLE THINKING CITIZEN.
free, fair reason to presume my sincerity. The circum-
stances attending my conviction are sufficiently known
to you. Exceptional as lire these circumstances, 1 have
never asked you to accept without reserve my statement
of innocence. It is sufficient for me to know that you
have asked yourself the question, "How would I like to
have been dealt with as Sufliuld has been dealt with ?”
On the bare self contradictory statemen t of a single fellow
creature, utterly unsupported by one shred of evidence.;
against the internal evidence; against personal evidence :
against the evidence of lime and locality: against the
evidence of character: against the theory of probabilities ;
against the dictates of common sense anil reason: over
the murdered reputations of persons, whose respectability
and integrity can be completely and overwhelmingly
established ; I have been, by a notorious Judge, acting
upon a plastic jury, adjudged to he a brutal ruJlian, and
sentenced to the horrors of ten years penal servitude, with
all its attendant awful disahilites, bur nearly eight
leaden years of that period I have beaten tuy heart against
the bars, appealing again, and again, ami again, for
Justice's sake, for humanity's sake, for Cod's sake, only
for one gleam of the daylight of enquiry; disdaining, all the
time, repeated oilers of liberty, conditional on my slicing
for mercy. On discharge, leaving behind me eight of
the best years of my prime, I find myself haunting the
purlieus of the Department of Justice, seeking for that


TO THE RESPECTABLE THINKING CITIZEN.
shred of Right, which as yet I ha ve failed to find ; begging
for the bread of justice to he offered the Hint of a con-
venient technicality, the ironstone of official precedent,
I need not ask you how you would like such a position to
be yours, your son’s or your brother's.
If this little publication possess no other
merit, at least it enables me in a more personal
manner, to lender yon my warm and grateful
thanks for the moral and practical support which
you have afforded me during my long and- protracted
suffering. I perfectly understand the grounds on which
you have so materially assisted me. Ido not infer you
to say (whatever may bo your private opinion), “The man
is innocent.” What I do understand is, that you are,
on consideration, certain that I was not proved guilty,
On this understanding, you, representing the vast
majority of a great community, have for eight years
rendered me a spontaneous, consistent, and persistent
support, To comprehend the value of your action, one
must consider what would be my position to-day with-
out it ?
On the other hand, there is a portion of the community
from which 1 have derived no benefit. It is that
minority formed of what I do not hesitate to term the
detrimental classes. The unjust judge; the spineless
Juryman: the callous Minister: the selfish .Politician ;
the narrow Citizen, indifferent to what does not directly
touch himself, to my mind are as inimical to you and


TO THE RESPECTABLE THINKING CITIZEN.
to me as are the plotter, the conspirator, the false witness,
the perjurer, the seducer and violator of women, the
forger, the thief, and the murderer.
The pamphlet which you doubtless procured from
my great and humane advocate, The Bulletin litis enabled
you to guage the measure of consideration I have re-
reived from such a quarter.
It therefore seems to me, that the "Suffield Case,"
affording as it does two issues; "Enquiry"' and "Burke
Enquiry," presents to us an arena in wltich are con-
fronted two combatants—One, armed with the means
and methods of clique-privilege, official precedent, and
red-tape technicality, stands as the champion of the
detrimental minority to which I have just alluded.
The other, for whose success I pray every day and night
of my life, is yourself, representing, as you undoubtedly
do, the respectable, law-abiding, justice-loving majority.
Inspired by the highest, the purest, the most unselfish
motives, you, by the attitude you have consistently
assumed in this matter, maintain yourself the guardian
of the equal administration ofjustice. And looking into
rny own heart, permit me to faithfully assure you that
in taking so natural a stand you cannot but be the
advocate of
Your Grateful Servant,
THOMAS SUFFIELD.

Behind my bars I tried the strains :
Then take, for better, or for worse
This —the rude jingle of my chains :
And if, in yours (a kindlier ear)
Threading the baser metal’s clang,
One purer echo linger clear,
Then—not in vain the fetters rang.


THE SISTERS OF THE CONVENT OF ST. MARY, DUBBO.)
"Inasmuch as unto the least,"
3jkOW blest the gentle of light
M That venture to illume
Some cold forgotten nook of night,
Where else were wholly gloom I
Who knows, on what small living thing
They fall —and what refreshment bring ?
Just as, beneath a cruel doom,
A prisoner, I bow ;
My heart so dark whene’er you come,
Is lighter, e’er you go ;
You never come but you are fraught
With warmth of speech,—and light of
thought,
Sisters 1 on us must come a day
When all shall Prisoners he ;
And shutting in this common clay,
The Earth lie heavily :
To you, in such a day of Night,
Shall steal an Angel, clothed with light;
Who, tenderly uplifting you,
Shall lead, (a wondrous way,)
Midst flowers of every glorious lute,
To everlasting day;
And, as you pass,—and wonder too,
Soft shall the Spirit answer you ;


“Lo I I, your sponsor, lead you forth,
And shine before you here ;
Twas I who watched your ways on Earth,
ifes—every smile and tear ;
What time ye did such gentle things,
Bright grew the Glory of my wings”
“Breathe, Sisters, breathe for ever, now
The incense of these flowers :
The flowers of Love ye strewed below,
Which God, to you restores
In perfect life and beauly seen
Never by mortal, King or Queen.”
“Look 1 in my radiance, blush and glow
The petals at your feet;
Put on your robes —and clothed so,
With loveliness complete,
And fraught with fragrance, come, for lo
He waits—on whom ye waited so.”

THE SILENT STRING.
WHEN I was blithe and free,
Oft lifted I a strain :
Poor fool! I sometimes thought it sweet:
And, when the stave I would repeat,
As oft I thought it vain.
Now,—l am prisoned here.
I try the chords again ;
And tho’ I know ’tis weak and poor,
Of strings I never stirred before
Surely I catch a strain.
Unto my lonely cell
There came, as in a dream,
A Presence beautiful, and brought
A harp—whose charmdd strings she wrought
To ecstasy supreme.
She struck a golden string,
Which living, round me wove
Quaint dreams where sun and shadow kissed,
And nooks of Silence whispered tryst;
I knew the spell of Love.
And then she swept the chords
That thrilled me through and through;
As clouds, that in the uncertain morn
Pass ’twixt the sun and waving corn,
Over my quivering soul were borne
The lingering notes of Woe.


Next, wondrous low and sweet,
But trembling ever clear,
A thrill of Hope she did sustain
And, as she stirred, she smiled again
To chide a falling tear.
“Mistress divine !” I cried,
(The music falling low)
“There is a string, in silence set,
Your fingers have not wakened yet,
Whose secret I would know,”
She bent her stately head ;
She laid her lyre aside ;
In the deep mysteries of her eyes
I saw the limpid Pity rise,
As softly she replied.
(And as she spake, it seemed
As I lay listening there,
That strays of lute and bird and bell,
All the sweet sounds that ever fell,
Enthralled the very air!)
“Mortal 1 I strike for you
The golden string of love:
Sweeter I know your lyre must be,
Tunbd to such pure memory,
Whene’er your hand you prove.”


“Mortal 1 I sweep the chords,
The melting wail of Woe :
Say—have you touched her chords before ?
I bid you strike them o'er ando’er !
Your strain shall upward go."
“Mortal ! to life I wake
Of Hope the slender .string ;
. However drear and dark his lot,
How can he sing who hopelh not ?
He cannot hope to sing,”
“Mortal! this silent string
Holds, in its leaden hue,
Dirge, Doom and Death. It is Despair.
Hush ! for its sombre silence there.

WHEN HONOR WEEPS.
Trial of Fraudulent Directors
" His Honor, in Sentencing the Prisoners, *lpas
visibly affected.”
—Sydney Press report.
(3f CROWDED court: a “cause celcbre
** A case that fairly takes the town ;
In all their precious mummery,
Sit parasites of “Wig’’ and “Gown”
And Fashion crowds to hear and stare,
The while the Law, avenging, keeps
A watch upon a guilt)' pair,
And dryly smiles, while Honor weeps.
With knitted brow, and rolling eye,
And heavy jaws that grimly lock ;
Mark 1 how a sinner sits to try
His trembling brothers in the dock ;
“Silence I” and here all ears are pricked,
And all the Court attention keeps,
As passing sentence, doubly tricked
In tears and tinsel, Honor weeps.


They tell me that this guilty pair
So lustful ol the golden sheaves,
Reckless of whose good bread was there.
I may not hold as common thieves;
I am no Judge : it may be so ;
I know that Reason sometimes sleeps :
Justice may nod : too well I know
Shame often laughs when Honor weeps
And I indeed were last to blame,
If I believed these tears sincere ;
’Tis kindly blurred, a blotted name,
When Pity drops an honest tear —
’Tis ill to see erst goodly men
Standing so pitiably poor,
Of name and honor reft But then,
How apt had Honor wept before !
But stay! maybe for him, whose loss
Lours heavy o’er his boys at play.
Whose girls, till this, no care might cross
But Mother’s arms could fold away :
The stricken widow in her dole,
Who houseless, aimless, hopeless, creeps ;
For these, maybe so soft a soul
Quickens until his Honor weeps ?
For these, on whom this bititer blight
(The toil of many a year in vain),
Falls as a pall of sudden night
Which clay may never lift again ;
For these, he visibly appears
Affected so ? Oh 1 not a whit I
Apportioned these judicial tears
To Gallery—boxes—and the pit!


Oh I Honor 1 hide your heavy face :
A kerchief to your cruel eyes I
And veil, in smug hypocrisy,
The savage jowl that never lies 1
When on the doomfed lads you fell
And snarling, bade your hangman creep
And launch the striplings into hell.
Your Honour 1 then you didn’t weep 1
When guiltless S d upright stood
And faced )ou, in the M d court,
How was’t so quickly you withstood
The plea for Justice there he brought?
Nor right nor ruth 'twas then you gave,
Rut down you thrust him in the deep,
And hurled him to his living grave,
Your Honor I then you didn’t weep)
And—what a main with Death you threw,
’Ere yet was proved the guilt of D—n !
“A heller Judge (the murmer grew),
Had not so good a tipsier been /”
How on your victim you had leapt
In all your pride of power and pelf 1
The Judge, not Justice, then that slept —
For then, you tried —and damned yourself!
Well Guilt may laugh, in devilish glee
Hugging the horror next his soul,
What chance has Innocence with me ?•’
His Honor’s name’s upon the roll I
Go I brand the virtuous wife a whore;
Give Falsehood way and bid her sweep
And gag the witness with your law,
While the blind eyes of Justice weep 1


When the mute agon}’ of Woe
No more one added pang may bear:
Of all the gifts of God, I know
The best, the dearest, is a Tear.
When the bowed heart at last is left,
Dark vigil with its Dead to keep,
Cleft is the gloom ! and thro’ the rift,
God’s gentlest Angel whispers “Weep I”
Oh I Tears ! poor Tears 1 that unseen fall,
Whose eloquence no pressmen tell,
Freight of worn eyes, wept to the wall ;
In the dark corner of the cell :
Salvage of foundered hearts —that none
But God may find ; and finding keeps
Till your dumb challenge, one by one,
Blasts such sly tears, as Honor weeps I
Ye are dumb hostages, to teach
Submission’s lessons to us all;
The giddiest heights of Pride to reach :
Down the dark slopes of Shame to fall;
Our stony griefs to fret away ;
To tell us, murmer as we will,
Building our Babels of a day,
We are but little children still;
To wash the stains of Shame and Guilt ;
To ease the weight of dull Despair ;
To cleanse, to comfort, chasten, melt;
To lead to pardon, peace, through Prayer
The torpid heart of Age to wake ;
To lull the fretful babe to sleep :
Who marvels ? He was Christ who spake
“Blessed indeed are ye who weep !'*


How base must be the wretch’s breast
Such pledge ot Mercy to profane!
Ne’er shall he know, when anguish-prest
The healing of your holy rain—
The brutal charlatan who strives
By shameful arts applause to reap
Of chance-met idlers, brazens lives
A sorry lie. —Your Honor weep 1
Oh Judge 1 Fate, in no stinted shower,
Hath dealt you honors, not a few ;
But lo ! there comes a sudden hour
When she, with hidden Ace to you,
Shall spurn your stake with shudd'ring hand
And you, and your dishonour sweep
(A carrion taint) from out the land.
And no impartial eye shall weep !
Oh, favoured land I so old, so new,
(Bright Alma Maker of my prime:)
Have I not honored, loved you too,
Dear as that Northern home of mine ?
A wanderer —o’er your rolling runs ;
A toiler—in your mine and mart;
A brother —midst your sunburnt sons ;
I never knew you wanted heart,
Australians : Britons : Brothers, too :
I ask, by every noble name,
Where are the hearts I thought I knew ?
Surely they ever beat the same f
Helpless, and hopeless, must I bear
Alone, forgot, the rotting years ?
Not one, who hears my broken prayer ?
Is there no market for MY tears P


Yes. If the kinder gales of Death
Lift gently o'er this prisoned clay :
And freed from this poor fett’ring sheath,
The Prisoner cast the Hodden Grey—
Wet be my Tears for One on high,
Who record for the helpless keeps ;
Who sees the wrong : and hears the sigh :
Counts every tear, when Plonor weeps I
Go, trembling strain ! poor prison song 1
But oh, how eloquent were ye,
If all my Right, and all my Wrong
I could, but as I would, give thee 1
Thou, Power of Right, thy help impart,
And breathe a blessing o’er my strain,
To touch Australia’s sleeping heart —
To take me, broken, back again.

On sovereign cares intent,

Come, Mistress of the Southern Sea,

What message do they bring?

Cold on the quivering heart as well,
But a living man’s own passing bell
Rings in the rune of the rust.
The rune, the rune of the rust.
To the tomb of the past, the Year
Glides with its shrouded dust:
And the darkened day, as it fades again,
A mourner adds to the funeral train,
To weep and to creep to the dumb refrain,
To the pitiless rune of the rust;
The rune, the rune of tire rust.
Rust—for the bolt and bar,
To cover, corrode, and crust,
And Oh I there creeps over body and soul,
A loathly leprous gibing ghoul,
With a closing clutch, as the years they roll
To the horrible rune of the rust,
The rune, the rune of the rust,


Manhood, Courage, an'd Hope,
Trampled and trailed in the dust;
Rotting muscle, and festering brain ;
How many years shall the sun and the rain
Day after day, beat the bars again,
To the tenible rune of the rust 1
The rune, the rune of the rust,
Day after day;—to steep
In the stench of corrupting dust;
To eat my bread with a sickening soul,
Drinking the slime of a stagnant pool
To the filth of the brute, to the wit of the fool,
To the bestial rune of the rust 1
The rune, the rune of the rust
Who comes to the bars, at night,
With a whisper never hushed ?
“Faith and Hope they have taken wing !
A man is a hungering thirsty tiling :
Nepenthe unto thy soul we bring
To the maddening rune of the rust
The rune, the rune of the rust.”
Were I the thing I scorn,
The slave of a biutal lust:
Are the long years I have log-like lain,
This sapping sloth’s lethean bane,
Spells that shall make me a man again,
To the withering rune of the rust?
The rnne, the’rune of the rust.


Gyve and fetter and bar
They cleanse : they polish ; they dust
But Ol for a care and a cleansing Art,
For the golden links of a human heart,
The God-head, dulled, in the man, to start
From the impious rune of the rust!
The Rune, the rune of the rust,
“O 1 every hour ye have cursed :
And every hope ye have crushed ;
To God, uplift an avenging song
To damn ye, fiends, who have hugged ray
wrong,
Gibbering sly in mine ears so long
Your devilish rune of the rust 1
The rune, the rune of the rust,


HODDEN GREY
Respectfully dedicated (inith thanks) to the Electors
of Singleton,
/|f\H I he may 101 l in his easy chair,
-Or ride in his car to town ;
And he may go in the good broad-cloth
And sleep m a couch of down ;
I may dwell in the felons cell,
Mine —for a year and a day,
The felon’s bread : and the felon’s bed :
And the felon's hodden grey.
If the Wrong were right,
And the Right were might,
What would the people say ?
Who would go in the good broad-cloth ?
And who in the hodden grey ?
His writ may hold in its lightest fold
The seal of his sovereign’s name :
From head to toe, let me blazoned go
In the government stamp of shame ;
If the folds of a heart could be torn apart,
How would the matter stand ?
Whose were bright with the talisman f
And whose were black with the brand f
If the Wrong were, &c.


Let him he sent to the Parliament.
Let me tie thrown to the Gaol i
He'll snugly sit in the Cabinet,
I’ll helpless ret in the cell ;
But if Parliament hut an hour were lent,
And God in the speaker’s chair;
Who were lift from the place of shame?
And who’d he transferred there ?
If the Wrong were right,
And the Right were Might,
What would the people say ?
Who would go in the good broad-cloth ?
And who—in the hodden grey ?
LINES TO MY CELL.
{My mind to me a Kingdom is).
JITIY cell to me a fortress is,
Where I a hostage dwell:
Mine innocence is my defence,
And Hope, my sentinel;
All braver thoughts encircling me,
A watch and ward do keep :
My challenge is security :
My countersign is sleep 1
And doubly safe, and doubly sure
And with me “All is well”
Since guarded by a band so pure,
A fortress is my cell.


My cell to me a Castle is.
Wherein I wave a wand :
A thousand winged messengers,
Spring up at my command j
With rushes sweet they strew my feet,
And when my couch is spread,
With silent wings, a canopy,
They hover round my head.
The moon o’er tower and turret is
My gentle seneschal:
And she shall mark my boundaries,
Whose castle is my cell.
My cell to me a Palace is,
Whose walls are stainless white :
And I, the King of all within,
Do rule, by writ of might;
If I so poor a cross endure,
If cross—then Crown as well;
I hold in due humility,
Whose Palace is a cell.
Who schools himself, he rules himself
And he is crowned as well;
Nor cup of gold, nor painted delf,
A palace is his cell 1

THE LILT OF THE LAG.
(Written in Dubbo Gaol. From my cell, I could
hear the hum of the streets.)
CHE night she brings on hov’ring wings
Her message to the town ;
The lamps are lit in the stirring street,
The burdened day is done ;
Over the heat of the lightened feet
Of them that pass along,
Music I hear so softly dear
A laugh and a lilt of song.
Music I hear; and a laugh and the lilt
Of them that pass me by :
Who hears the prisoner’s pitiful moan ?
The Prisoner’s sorrowful sigh ?
Oh 1 I could throw a stone, I know,
From here to the cheerful street,
Where the singer trolls his mefry round,
And the laughing people meet;
Oh! I could throw a stone, I know,
To a hearth and home, so near,
That a gentle hand o’er the keys may stray,
Whose broken chords I hear.
Music I hear, &c.


Only a snatch of the careless catch
Of a fleeting melody ;
But wondrous clear to a Prisoner here
Tis throated of Liberty :
Laughter! the ring of the very thing
Smites me, and mocks, and jars,
As here I lie in my misery,
With my face upturned to the bars.
Music I hear, &c,
Music divine 1 this waif of thine
Brings me, from buried years,
A light that Hies from her haunting eyes
Through a heavy shroud of tears ;
Lost chords of her lost lingers, stirred
When her love inspired the air;
Love, music, light: and now, this blight
Of silence and despair.
Music I hear, &c,
See l how I kneel and again appeal
'J his servant of the Crown ;
As I never thought I had been brought
To plead. For what ? mine own I
He will not brook my steady look
As 1 would have him do,
Nor in aught assail my damning tale,
For alas I it is 100 true.
Music I hear, &c,
I lift to him these fetters grim,
These hands with never a stain,
And this I claim in the Highest Name,
Only my Right again !
In very sooth, as the very Truth
For ever and ever stands,
He beats apace, mine upturned face
As I lift these fettered hands 1
Music 1 hear, &c.


No more I’ll bring this craven thing
My prayer, with poor hands bound ;
Back ! Back ! I throw each shameful blow
That beats me down to the ground :
His hand must be that striketh me
Who kneeleth so forlorn,
All stained and wet with his Master’s sweat
And for Him, he plaits the thorn !
Music I hear, &c,
(For brothers,—ye that pass by me,
Speak I in aught amiss,
If I say your creed is a lie indeed,
F its anything else but this ?
“For inasmuch as unto such
The least of these ye do ;
Even so ye do the Christ unto,
Who died and lives for you).
Music I hear, &c,
Someday I know, above or below,
I’ll meet him face to face :
Fettered no more a prisoner poor,
Nor liveried in disgrace,
Not in array of hodden grey,
But standing erect again,
Clothed in woof of the perfect proof,
How will he meet me —then ?
Music I hear, &c,
And how will you then meet me too,
Under whose very eyes,
This laying out of my manhood stout,
This quivering sacrifice?
It is not hid, this coffin lid
That shuts on a living Right—
A throbbing thing while they nail me in,
Ye stand and ye hold the light 1
Music I hear, &c,


When the low light of falling night
Holds the poor things at home ;
Oh ! how they shrink, and fear to think
Where does the wanderer roam I
With what poor smiles and artless wiles
They clothe this Silence fell;
Oh 1 dream, I crave, of the kindly grave,
But not of this cruel cell.
Music I hear, &c.
Let Justice (I) back the bloody pack
That tears and harries me :
It is not done, when the darkened sun
Glowers on my liberty ;
Nor will I go, beaten and low,
To creep with abated breath :
For by all I love! by the God above I
I light this out —to the death 1
Music I hear, &c:
Oh ! hear my moan I or—are ye stone,
With neither sense nor shame ?
A brazen taunt is this your vaunt,
Your fair Australian name?
“Fair 1 Equal I Free I’ 1 ye challenged me
Or ever I saw your shores—
Oh 1 look on me 1 which of the three,
Australians 1 is yours ?
Music I hear, &c.
Oh I hear my moan! or—are ye stone,
With neither sense nor shame ?
Oh I hear my cry 1 ne'er free am I,
If ye lift me not from blame ;
No bargaining, for I scorn the thing,
With these base hands that smite—
JUSTICE! I pray, thro’ the Truth alway,
The brimming Cup of my Right!
Music I hear, &c.


ON STOLEN STRINGS,
{Specially addressed to All ivlwnt it may concent.)
(£s)TONE walls do not a prison make,
Nor iron bars a cage ;
Quiet minds and innocent do take
That for a hermitage.”
If I be free, since free from guilt,
I never was but free :
And whoso stabs me to the hilt,
Knows no such liberty.
“Guilt is the grim chamberlain
That lights you to your bed ;
And draws your midnight curtains round
With fingers bloody red.”
Mine handmaidens the kindly Night
That clothes my naked cell:
And Innocence, with whisper light,
“Hope on I and slumber well!”
"He either fears his fate too much,
Or his deserts are small;
Who dare not put it to the touch,
To win, or lose it all."


I cry to meet this evil shame
With weapons good and true ;
Curs! ye are silent to the blame
That points it full at you 1
“He liveth best, who loveth best
All things, both great and small;
For the dear God who lovest him,
He made—-and loves them all.”
God me so love that I so live,
Whether as bond or free,
That all my ways the lie shall give
The fiends that harry me.
“Blind unbelief is sure to err,
And scan his works in vain ;
God is His own Interpreter,
And He will make it plain.”
Alone with Him, my prayer shall be
“Dli I draw the veil aside !”
Dare ye His Presence seek that He
That curtain open wide ?

IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT
(Specially addressed to All whom it may concern)
ItN the dead of night,
When low is the light,
Alone and slumberless;
Have ye never lain,
As a child again,
’Neath the weight of a vague distress ?
In the dead of night,
When low is the light,
Alone and slumberless ?
In the dead of night.
When low is the light,
And the shadows flicker there ;
When the seconds tick
To the shrouded wick;
And a stealth is hushed on the stair 1
And a coal falls dead
From the embers red,
Like a shot on the whispering air :
In the dead of night
When low is the light,
And a stealth is hushed on the stair,


In the dead of night,
Have ye never a sprite
That ye know—and hate—and dread ?
That round and round
With a sudden bound
Leaps, loathly, on your bed,
Whose finger-tips your bosom grips,
Till you turn on the Thing and crave
A curse that slips
From your wicked lips,
As a groan from an open grave 1
In the deail of night,
When low is the light,
As a groan from an opening grave.
God us array
In the night and the day,
With purposes sincere
Under His sight,
In the day and the night,
That all our ways be clear;
Wherefore, the Right
In the broad daylight,
Shall hold us without fear:
Wherefore His Light
In the Dead of Night,
Shall burn for us most clear:
In the Dead of night,
When low is the light,
And a stealth is hushed on the stair.


TO JUNIOR.
{A J ack-iu-Ofjicc (locum tenens) who treated me
with gratuitous impertinence).
H.M.G.B.
Qf RETORT FROM the wretch in whom,
A* stricken and friendless,
You saw but a mark for your gibes and your
jeers;
Whose halting and helpless appeal for cheap
kindness,
Tour chivalry deemed a fair target for sneers :
Let Memory bring back a day to your shame, sir,
When cut to the heart by your look and
your tone,'
The Prisoner bowed, who now tells you his
name, sir,
A name, which was never so low as your own!
This Precept is preached by your practice, I fear,
And written in dust on your surgery shelf:
There isn't a drug in the pharmacopoeia,
A drug on the market as you are yourself !
—THOMAS SUFFIELD.


WHEN STEALS THE BREEZE
JtffttlHEN steals the breeze thro’ Prison bars,
A breath of liberty
The Prisoner lifts from thralling cares,
And bids him still be free ;
To such a whisper so divine,
If I should give no het.d,
Then fettered were this heart of mine,
And I were bond, indeed.
“I come ” —(so murmuroth the Wind,)
“ No wanton wanderer here ;
For I have kissed (nor long resigned)
All that ye hold most dear;
Nay, with my burden, softly sweet,
A blending breath hath come,
And quickening, shall to thee repeat
Tlie sacred name of Horae.”
“For hovering o’er a distant scene,
I stirred the reverent air,
And caught thy name, (with wings unseen,)
Upon the breath of Prayer;
And here, the burden I resign,
That thou shall ne’er essay
A thought to chain that heart of thine,
For whom, and thus, they pray.”


“Surely thy bosom well may be
To darker prompting prone ;
When Faith and Hope together (lee,
And leave thee so alone:
But—gyves may jar, and fetters ring,
(Let this be plain to thee :)
And fettered by no baser thing,
The prisoner still be free 1”
“E’en I so light upon thy brow,
Must go, not as I list:
I have been fettered just as thou,
With bonds I have not kissed :
A Prisoner, when the Cavern's height
Hath mocked my struggles vain,
Oft have been curbed my freest (light,
And will be curbed again.”
“Stirred in unutterable throes
Of Earth and Air and Deep ;
Cradled amidst th’ inviolate snows
Of what stupendous steep 1
Lost, in immeasurable might
Of Wild, anil Waste, and Sea;
Spirit of Breadth, and Depth ,and Height I
/am not wholly free
“ But, with the ever-whirring Spheres,
Obeisant to one Law;
Submissive still, when Ocean dares,
And with the wastes I war;
Held in the hollow of His Hand
Who givelh rule nor rhyme,
Why, still or stirred at His command —
Save—it is His good time.”


“And now, responsive to the rune
Of field or forest green ;
While Earth, bewitched, as I croon,
Varies the Heeling scene :
Toying with honey-laden bees,
Beaten by gentle wings,
O’er fragrant groves, and flowery leas,
Throbbing with subtle things,”
“ I come. And thee, poor prisoner here
To lift and purify,
Bid thee no more the fetters fear,
That leave thee free as I:
They cannot chain the Prisoner’s heart.
Though his poor limbs they bind ;
HE manumits that better part,
Whose prisoner is the Wind !”
“ So, if all mean and baser things
Ye bravely hold at bay,
No matter that the iron rings
About the sorry clay :
If fresh and pure thine Heart thou keep,
Despite this galling chain,
I—whose poor province is the Deep,
Rule no such proud domain.”
Oh! Heavenly Whisper! Thou dost bless
And soothe my very dole:
For I have feared this bitterness
Would eat into my soul:
Honor and Arms I humbly take
From thee : and thro’ the night,
I’ll guard them till the Darkness break,
And Morning find them bright.


STAR! SOFTLY SHINE,
(I suppose every unfortunate who has passed through
the ordeal of "Separate treatment" will hear me out
when I remark, that the spirits of the solitary are
raised or depressed hy circumslanees the most trivial.
For instance, I used to attach much importance to the
appearance of a parlicularstar, which I cmildsee through
the liars, if 1 stood at the far end of my cell, ,1 derived a
meaning or message or portent of comfort or cheer from
Us appearance; and when it failed me, 1 found it dill'umlt
to shake off a consequent depression.
To this beautiful visitor these, linos were composed while
I was actually undergoing "separate treatment " in
Bathurst Goal,)
(ITS a white Swan may, hovering- in the dawn,
One golden moment rest ;
And the soft down, which tier swift flight hath torn
Fall floating from her breast;
Steeped in the light, be gently, lowly home
To comfort some poor nest ;
Star, softly shine!
Poised on glittering wings,
Sired thy bright affluence
On poor darkened tilings.
Star, softly shine ! on glittering pinions rest;
An angel hovering so :
And falling, as the down from thy bright breast,
Thy lucent pity, low ;
So this poor heart, of Earthly cares a nest,
Some Higher comfort know.
Star, softly shine!
Poisbd on glittering wings,
Shed thy bright affluence
On poor darkened things.


WENSLEYDALE.
(A Song of Home ; to; Men hy the light of the moon.
in my cell)
! Wensleydale ! dear Wensleydale !
What tho’ I be so far away,
And lonely pace a prison cell
To hold a deadly wrong- at bay ?
The Moon, she crosses, white and pure,
My narrow prison’s barnki pale ;
And she shall be a silver lure
To lead me back to Wensleydale !
Fall, Bolt and Bar! Ring, Steel and Stone!
From fall of Night to break of day,
This body is your lien alone ;
This heart, unfettered, flies away
By glow and gleam : and rack and rain,
And wild and waste, and sea and shale,
And wood and wold, and mount and main,
My heart is back in Wensleydale,
Oh Wensleydale ! dear Wensleydale !
Nor bolt nor bar can part us two ;
Tho’ cherished hopes lie deathly pale,
I still have left the past with you !
Once more upon the wooded lawn,
I watch the flickering shadows fail ;
Once more, upon the River borne,
I hear the Bells of Wensleydale !


Once more, and thro’ this wicket gate
■ The well-known path be mine to night,
Where the great beeches meet and mate,
Grim sentinels in black and white :
Here—resting on this uncouth seat —
I once was told the fondest tale /
Do Earth and Heaven ever meet?
I thought so, once—in Wensleydale,
’Tis Summer; and the thirsty Year
Hath deeply drained old Yore, I know,
For, falling over Mickley Weir,
His song is breaking faint and low;
Hack Fall’s far thunder trembles down;
Bass droning to th’ according vale,
The rock-stemmed River's monotone,
The deep key note of Wensleydale.
Hark / perched on Mowbray’s ivied height,
A throstle, at the early moon,
Waketh in wonder and delight,
And lifteth such a marvellous tune I
His mate, deep ambushed in the dene,
Catches and fills the liquid tale ;
And sprites of silver, gray, and green,
Chaunt “Echo /” all thro’ Wensleydale/
Harsh o’er the softer sounds of Night
Old Ebor bays, (the great bloodhound;)
There ■' —starting, in the white moonlight,
The old Home guards its hallowed ground
With Crinkling lights the casements glow —
Familiar voices faint and fail:
And Music soft / and laughter low
Thrill, “Florae/ Sweet liomel” in
Wensleydale I"


Pure lift of love 1 soft stray of bell 1
Ah, plaint of Weir I ami broken fall !
Sweet sounds; sweet prayers : and sweetest
spell—
The holy homeliness of all :
Surely the Night wind, soft and shy,
Confessing all the trembling vale,
Must breath a shrift in every sigh—•
“ Hush, Wensleydale ! hush, Wensleydale”
There is no shame in hodden gray
For me, who suffer this despite :
Whate’er my Earthly judge may say,
Mine is the ermine, in God’s sight:
His chastening 1 may not despise,
It must be kind, and who can tell ?
The hand that now so heavy lies,
May lift and lead to Wensleydale,
Who, throned amidst eternal spheres,
Can stop to mark the sparrow’s flight;
Who weighs my sins must count my tear, ;
Who knows my wrong, must hold my right;
The hearts of Captive anil of King
Alike from Him no secrets veil;
PJe will not chide if, as 1 sing,
Hope springs again to Wensleydale I
Thou I who dost all control and know,
Who liv’st and art in everything :
Who metes the runnel's ebb and flow,
Who bidst the speckled throstle sing ;
Bid springs of Faith within me start ;
A humbler—higher song prevail :
0 1 hush 1 hou this rebellious heart,
As hushed to night in Wensleydale,


IN MEMORIAM
,S died in the Prison Hospital rSgj, soon after
the refusal of his petition for remission ,)
grey, on prison pallet,
All that's left since that dread second.
Knew he, as slow broke the daylight,
Whose the hand that grimly beckoned ?
Tho’ in vain his brother mortal
Prayed he, for some poor remission ;
Death hath opened wide the portal
God hath read that poor petition.
Oh I may He grant and give Remission 1


THROUGH PRISON BARS.
(after “in cellar cool.”)
{Written after refusing Minister Gould's offers
of remission)
CHRO’ prison bars 1,11 stoutly sing,
Since tis mine own good pleasure :
And every link the fetters clink,
A measure give for measure ;
And since the Cap (by foul mishap,)
Of fortune fit no better
Than gyves and chains, I’ll cap my pains
And jingle every letter /
Thro’ Prison Bars I’ll stoutly sing,
Since tis mine own good pleasure :
And every link the Fetters clink,
A measure, give for measure I
The world but one vast Prison is,
Where each must serve his sentence :
And he whose chain doth weaker wane,
The stouter his repentance :
And who shall hold both gear and gold,
Plis bonds shall be the strongest:
And draught or drug he'll dearly hug
That bids him hug them longest 1
Thro’ prison bars he grins, I trow,
The Prince, the Peer, the Porter;
And sire or son. there is’nt one
Would have his sentence shorter I
Each hugs a chain of Pride or Pain,
Pelf, Poverty, or Passion ;
And he may rust in li.nks of Lust;
In fetters she, of Fashion.


The maiden trips (whose rosy lips
Are sung in many a sonnet);
In leading strings of ribbons, rings,
Her mirror and her bonnet;
Her lover crossed and vainly tossed
In muling melancholy,
From heel to head, a silken thread
Secures him in his folly !
The Parson prates; and in his rates
A screw he puts his thumb in ;
Plis holy withes are fattest tithes.
Nor rues he mint and cumin
And he that most defiant is
Of all the laws that tie, e’er
The Devil his best client is—
The Lawyer bound to lie e’er 1
The Miser wears the ring he hears
Of every coin that jingles ;
His liquid links, who deeply drinks,
Fie welds as well as mingles ;
Then thro’ the bars I’ll stoutly sing.
For who can boast him better ?
Or up or down but he must own
Fie wears, as I, a fetter 1
And so, the world a prison is,
Where each, e'er he hath quitted ;
The King, the Churl, the belted Earl,
Doth surely stand committed ;
When Death, (a turnkey); each enlarge
To meet the last decision,
There’s none awaiting his discharge,
But hopelh for—Remission 1
Thro’ Prison Bars I’ll stoutly sing
Since ’tis mine own good pleasure
And every link the fetters clink,
A measure give for measure 1


AS A FLOWER.
(Written on the death of a little child).
mILL tiie great Father count it,
That ye ask with repining breath,
“Was there none but this, in the ways of Life
For the ruthless steps of Death?
Ours, too is such a little nook,
Where our cherished blossom grew;
And 0, she was so much to us—
Such a little thing to you !
Hush ! beyond living wisdom
Are the ordered ways of Death ;
As one that plucketh a priceless bud
To crown a fadeless wreath,
He hath come, in his best and bravest,
As an Angel, wise and true ;
Hidden in mists of Mercy,
We, darkling, see not through.
Lo i when she laughed in the sunlight,
Was she not fair as fair f
Asleep, in her little coffin,
Was she not smiling, there f
What will she be, when she greets you
With rays unclosed and clear,
When she springs in her deathless beauty,
As a Flower, that noddeth near ?

TO MILTON SYDNEY LOVE, Esq
(Once Visiting Justice to H.M. Goal, Dnhho ,
whose great kindness I can never forget,)
m HAT’S in a name ? An appellation
For everything that makes Creation ;
Whence everything distinction takes
From everything Creation makes.
Therefore, an Ass, an ass we call,
Not that he is an ass at all;
But that, (my logic you’ll allow):
He isn't well, we’ll say—a Cow.
It similarly comes to pass
A cow is not set down an ass;
That who would milk, or who would yoke,
Yoke not the cow, nor milk the moke.
A matter of convenience
Where sound oft serves to master sense.
As instanced in these later days,
When the loud Politician brays ;
Threatens the state to overthrow —
(Why is he not at Jerico) ?
As oft the contradiction’s seen
Where Black looks White, and Brown turns
Green :
Enough 1 nor let me further quote
Nor pothook now, what Hood once wrote.


But if in names, is oft deception,
Pray let me sing his rare exception,
Who's named on such a perfect plan.
That all who name must “love” the man )
And he, an unassuming elf,
Whene’er he names, must “love’’ himself |
Nay I all who hate, (if such), confess,
If they would curse, they first must bless :
For who to him the most averse is,
Must “love” him every time he curses !
And so, a Name the truth may tell;
Who names, or ’knows him, “loves” him well,
And let him come, or let him go ;
“Love” him accompanies also.
He’s aptly named, (as proved above) ;
Whose name and nature both are “Love” ;
The more, that on a perfect plan,
Pie lives, a thorough gentleman ;
A just and fearless gentleman.
COUSINS.
a pleasant seat together,
When the year was busy Maying,
Warm the wind, and fair the weather,
Jack to bonny Kate was saying :
“Princess Charming i “(how he cozens)
Did you ever play at “Cousins ?”


“No! laughs careless Kate replying;
“That’s a game I never heard of;
And indeed I’m really dying
Explanation for a word of:
Tho’ of course I’ve got, by dozens,
Uncles, Aunts, and country Cousins.”
“Listen, Kate : the game I’ll teach you,
If you're an attentive hearer;
You must sit where I can reach you,
Can’t you come a little nearer ?
There! Iso steal kisses I dozens 1
That's the way to play at cousins” 1
Kate escap ng, tresses shaking,
“Jack, you wretch I this is a pastime
I am very much mistaken,
Tisn’t long since you played, last Lime 1
“Stealing kisses, oh I a dozen
Sure a cheat must be a cosen” 1
* *
Mark 1 when last together seated,
Kate and Jack mine eyes 1 put on :
They were most approximated,
And she didn’t care a button I
Paying back, indeed by dozens,
All the tricks she took at “Cousins 1
BILL SYKES’ FAREWELL
ItF hanged I must be to a limb of this tree,
I cry, though the prospect is grim ;
I’ll trouble no more e’er a limb of the law,
If I once get the law of this limb.


I hear ’em all say there’s the devil to pay,
And I must the ready produce ;
Well, it helps me to know when I’m dancin’ below,
I shan’t be so hard up for “noose.”
And if the last stretch 1 that ever I’ll fetch,
I’ve copped just for stretching a cop,“
You may bet I’ll be true to the Bill you all knew
For I’ll peg,, as I’m taking a drop 1
Deuce take it! Bedad, 'lis hard on a lad ;
But I’m hanged if I’m going to mope ;
Tho’ I wish I had got, (although not in a knot)
What I’m promised,—a little more “rope”
For thimbles and slags-t I’ll do no more drags,*
The coppermcn 0 hold every jack ;
With the devil a dib, all thro’ cracking a crib,
I’ll find my last crib, in a crack I
'Ere I bid you goodbye, (tho 1 I. never say die);
I wish I could echo “all cush I”?
As we can’t have a pitch B ’ere they give me the twitch,
I’m leaving a “line” for the push.
So, farewell dear pals 1 through sunshine and squalls
No longer shall Bill be your guide :
For he’s into a strait of the ocean of Fate,
Where the current I guess is “high-tied”
And now I. must jig for a pull at my gig,,.
Which yet I’m permitted to fill;
When finally out is the last of my snout, «
May none have a snout 11 on yours, Bill,

THE BUSH PHILOSOPHER.
CPUS practical ditty I’ve found an invention
Of value, for by its adroit intervention
At critical junctures, which duly 1 mention,
There’s nothing- a trouble to me.
If the boss wants a hand when my‘‘dhudeen I’m
It someone or oilier is bringing his bill in ;
If Pat wants a nobbier, or Mickey a shillin’ :
My answer is pat, don’t you see :
“Oh dear I wait till the billy boils ;
I wonder how long it’ll be?
To the bush where you’re going to save up your
money,
There’s kicks with the ha’pence, and strings with
the honey,
On mutton and damper, a cake christened
“Johnny,”
The best of your pickings will be—
When you’ve trod on a centipede, sat on another
one ;
When the damper’s a “sod,” and your blessings
you smother ’em;
Midst mortification, mosquitoes (Oh bother ’em)
Your blest consolation will be ;
Oh, dearl wait till the billy boils,
I wonder how long it’ll be f


For devilment, dancing, dolight, and “divarsions”
Without any help of the priest’s or the parson’s
Tis down at the publican’s, Billy M’Pharson’s,
The ladies will sit on your knee ;
When the cheque in my belt is well up to “three-
figger,”
When the missus, the talent, and Billy all snigger,
When I feel myself swelling oh I bigger and
bigger,
There’s something that whispers to me ;
Oh dearl wait till the billy boils,
I wonder how long it’ll be ?
Once I was shook on old Mulligan’s “darter;”
(Such an elegant 'foot never slipped through a
garter:)
Says I “Larry goshoon ] ’tis your Biddy I’m
arter,”
“Oh I tis Biddy yere afther,” says he—
“ Well don’t after Biddy ye come any furder,
Or bejabers! yerself I’ll be afther to murder I”
And Biddy she bawled, and you ought to have
heard her,
This elegant strain after me :
0 dearl wait till the billy boils,
I wonder how long it will be ?
So ladies and gentlemen, all who are listen!n.
There’s a time to be fightin’: A time to be
kissin’ in;
A time for the weddin’, a time for the christenin’ ;
A time for the wake there must be;
There’s a time to be born: and a time to be
buryin’ :
A time to be sad; and a time to be merry in :
And faith I but there’s lashing of time for no
hurry in :
And that’s what the song says to me.
Oh dear I wait till the billy boils,
1 wonder how long it will be ?


CAVE ! “ BULLETIN.!’
(On hearing of a departmental ukase interdicting
the "Bulletin:')
3|tY Bell and Book and Candle,
’Tis sworn to exorcise
The turnkey who shall handle,
Who borrows, begs, or buys,
Who steals, or lends, or loses,
Who carries out, or in,
Who uses, or peruses
The rosy Bulletin :
He shall, by regulation,
Declared these presents in,
Of his elimination,
Digest the Bulletin. I
Retrenchment hath a claw in
This meek officials’ pay :
By economic sawin’
Eight hours are ten, a day
To Jack-in-office bluster
Submissive he must grin ;
When the whisper flies at ‘’Muster,”
“Beware the Bulletin \”


Proscription the prescription
Of the “system’s” ever been :
Its fatuous subscription
To the rosy Bulletin !
From Pharisaic twaddle
Why so elect ? In sooth,
No “cady” for the noddle
Of the “system” is the truth :
And the devils own disaster
Were to let the daylight in ?
And oh ! what price a plaster
Of the rosy Bulletin I
Methinks this holy horror
Is an invite further in,
From our Sodom and Gomorrah
To the rosy Bulletin 1


A PAINFUL FAREWELL.
{Being an elegy written on a Window,)
During the earlier part of my confinement in Dubbo
Gaol, 1 was employed as a writer. .1 was located in an
office, the window of which afforded a view of the Gaoler’s
garden and the street.
Certain building alterations deprived me of this ines-
timable consolation. Hence the following lines,
LAS ! alas ! ah, woe is me!
Alack! and well-a-day !
Did you a mortal ever see
In such a panehil way ?
Will any mortal ever be
In such a way again ?
For oh ! they double every ache,
To take away my pane 1
And must I sing, oh ! window dear!
Farewell i in mournful strains,
There never yet was mortal here
So loth to lose his panes I
Oh 1 lux(ury), a fond, a long,
A lasl farewell to you 1
’Tis not enough to prison me,
They must coniine my view:
If things go on at such a bout,
Flo 1 warders, weep and wail;
They’ll brick the Gaoler in or out,
And then, shut in the Gaol 1


For me, through you, sweet magic grew
Beside the garden track :
The primrose look me home again,
The orange lured me hack :
Through you, old friend, bright eyes
glanced
As frankly as could be ;
And oft have merry children laughed
To share the laugh with me.
Thy simple spell, old window dear,
Full oft my fetters beat;
For many a pleasant jaunt have 1
Through you, had up the street ;
And if, through you, as fancy led,
A passing cal) J’d hail,
You never grudged the fare, old friend,
That franked me from the Gaol.
Oft, when the town was all agog,
Through you, I’ve crossed the way ;
Ami there was none in all the crowd
That shunned the hodden grey !
Through you, I’ve heard the Wedding-bell
Through you. I’ve thrown the shoe ;
Through you has tolled a sterner knell,
(Ami told a mourner, too).
I've conjured many a vanished scene
(Through you), of wold and wave;
Till eye has tilled, and heart has thrilled,
I've bowed to Him who gave.
Now closed in these stolid stones
I watch my life-time wane;
I bow to that Tite-Barnacle
Who grudges me my pane I


Ah me | no more my roving eyes
May reach the distant flat;
My only range, the kitchen range,
(I'll long be looking at I)
The prison store ; the hospital
Where the wardsraan greets the crew;—
“Abandon Hope who enter here,
For things, like me, are bluel”*
In vain I eloquently plead,
And hint at vested rights:
Pm not allowed to go according
To my (ancient) lights |
My “camera” a “camera
Obscura” now must be;
And regulation all my plates,
And that's what dishes me |
Oh dear 1 Alas I and well-a-day 1
A poor look out, I doubt,
That I must now be looking in,
So long a-looking out;
But never mind | a watch I'll keep
Oh prison gate I on thee,
And time will come, (tho 1 time may creep.)
Thou’lt keep no watch on me i
And so I pour, old window dear I
In mournfullest of lays,
Libation on thy bitter “bier” ;
Thou light, of other Days I
•Prisoner hospital wardamen are dressed in blue serge.


ARM A VIRUMQUE CANO.
(a cricketing cantict.e)
/AreAT Phoebus I and ye tuneful Nine
That e’er supremely reign ;
A little spare “afflatus” please,
To swell a slender strain.
Nor less than I, an easy youth,
Am not the sort of bard
In rude hexameters to roar
Heroics, by the yard.
I need no blast of trumpet,
Clash of lance, or whirr of sword ;
I only ask a summer breeze
To kiss a level sward ;
No Marathon do I declaim,
I sing no Waterloo,
But tell, in peaceful numbers,
What good cricketers may do I
I want no cannon thundering
With death in every note I
But the chuckle of the batsman
When the umpire sings “Not out” I


No hateful strife of clenching hands
All stiffening in gore ;
But the handshake of a cricketer,
When a close game is o’er,
For who indeed is Armstrong ?
Who cares a cuss for Krupp ?
If Tram hie gets a shooter by,
And Ranji’s bails are up f
And what the side and science
Of each military snob,
When Hearne manoeuvres Giffen
With a curly little lob ?
Though the papers gravely tell us
That the “ tribes " retire with loss ;
It’s a more important matter
That Maclaren wins the toss /
That the gravity of England
Is increasing, while the bat
Of the doughty Brown’s suspended
To the query, “ How is that ?”
That Australia’s hopes are rising
With the figures on the board,
With the hundreds evanescent.
And the fifth is duly scored I
Sing Hey I Sing Ho I ye Cornstalks ;
Let Darling sing a strain :
And Gregory, Hill, and Noble
Take the triumph up again 1


Sing oh t Sing low i oh England,
For the odds are ten to one,
Spite of Ranji and Maclaren
And of Richardson, ye’re done [
So by the lyre of Phoebus,
And by all (he tuneful nine !
(How had the Roman chanted
If he’d had a theme like mine \)
At ma 'bifumqae cam
(Sing bat and ball and “ bricks”)
May the popping crease be distant,
Where old Charon keeps the “ Styx I

THE GAGE.
mHO marks an influence arise,
Of subtle power posscst,
The trembling; blossom to surprise
From beauty’s guileless breast;
The gage is thrown !
A lance to break
In Honor’s cause.
For Woman’s sake ’•
Oh ! shall he not that limpid glance
Meet with a glance as pure,
And, Champion of her Innocence,
For her, the llow'r secure ?
Accept the gage!
A lance to break
In honor’s cause,
For Woman’s sake 1


AUSTRAL lE.
#H ! she may glide on Fortune's tide
In Fashion’s feathers line,
Or she may run, at set of sun,
To meet the homing kino :
Or high or low, howe’er site go,
It matters not to me ;
There is’nt one beneath the sun
Like sunny Australie •
Or high or low,
Howe’er she go,
it matters not to me ;
There isn’t one
Beneath the sun,
Like sunny Australie 1
Oh I she may turn the oaken churn,
Or she may lead the dance ;
Barefooted, she may cross the lea.
As straight as any lance ;
Or satin shoot) may be her own ;
It matters not to me ;
There isn’t one beneath the sun,
Like sunny Australie I
Or high or low, &c,
A gilded dome may roof her home,
Or shingled be her cot;
A Queen is she where’er she be,
Whatever be her lot ;
Her title’s good, tho’ not a rood
Be hers of lawn or lea :
In every heart is writ the chart,
The Right of Australie I
Or high or low, &c.


The Waratah her cheek so fair
Hath kissed ; and through her hair
The Wattle blows, to reach the Rose
That paints her lips so rare ;
The Wonga’s note is in her throat:
Her glances fireflies be ;
The lily rests and guards the breast
Of sunny Australie |
Or high or low, &c.
Whether a gleam, a golden beam
Or Night have caught her hair;
Her eyes their hue be brown or blue
I rfickon not nor care ;
Her hand, so light and lily-white,
Or worn with cares may be ;
As proven steel the heart is l£al,
The heart of Australie !
Or high or low, &c,
Though all the sheen of Sheba’s Queen
About her beauty burn ;
Though not a plack be on her back,
But what her hands may earn :
Some homely airs the palace wears;
A palace, home must be :
Wherever stands with ready hands,
The lass of Australie !
Or high or low,
Howe’er she go,
It matters not to me
There isn’t one
Beneath the sun,
Like sunny Australie 1


THE SMILE THAT LIGHTS.
[To a beautiful visitor \ who saw not in the
prisoner a hodden gra] automaton : but a sn/firing
fellow-creature ; a mark for her womanly courtesy ,
her delicate consideration. I shall respectfully
remember her, and hold her, with all I hold first,
as long as I live.)
CHE spell of your beauty had haunted me
wholly,
And dark were the place since I saw you depart
But this that I cherish, and hold the most holy,
The Angel that sped through your eyes from
your heart.
You resled, ere lost through the gates of my prison,
Nor scorned the poor service my fetters allowed ;
How gently you thanked me I a queen you
had risen ;
A pitying Woman, you smiled as you bowed.
Lady | I pray for thee
Ever and a)'e for thee
All I’d essay for thee,
Whoever thou art!
Oh | and the rarity
Of your pure charity ;
Beautiful smile 1 that is lighting
my heart I
I were not mortal had I never noted
The charm of your presence, the grace of
your hands;
The folds of your robe; and the perfume, that
floated
Around me, awaiting your gentle commands.
How could I dream, in the space of a prison,
The height of my loneness, the depth of my
dole,
A beautiful woman would bring such a vision ?
A glimpse of the light of her beautiful soul I


Lady, I pray for thee,
Ever and aye for thee ;
Yes | I could die for thee,
Whoever thou art I
God send thee light and love,
Surely Fie counts above
Every smile that is lighting a heart.
“WAIT TILL MY SHIP
COMES IN.”
(children’s saying.)
CHE tide had turned ; the yellow sands hashed
broad beneath the sun ;
The sky was blue as it should be ; the while cliffs
whiter shone ;
Over the bay the Ocean lav, heaving and glittering,
As homeward o’er his breast the while, the ships were
coming in.
A little lonely lass there was, who wondering watched
the sight:
She saw the stately vessels pass ; the far sails filling
white ;
“ Oh I wondrous ships that speed 1” see cried, ‘’What
happy homes ye win I”
“For well I know, that just like you, some day my
ship conies in I"
(Oh 1 happy bark I whose silken sails
The breeze may never know ;
While mother prays, God guards the helm,
And Life is at the prow 1)


Some Springs had lent their tenderness that little
maiden, grown
To girlhood’s bright and lissom grace, when next I
saw her roam
Hard by the margin of the Sea : as fair, as pure a
_ thing,
As in the rolling world can be —a woman in her spring.
No more a lonely lass is she, —for one beside her
stands
As straight and strong as heroes be. who, holds her
little hands,
And cries, “ Come, little sweetheart, smile I shall
tears those bright eyes dim ?
No 1 tho' the storm may rage awhile, wait till our
ship comes in!”
(01 Gallant bark I whose gleaming sails
The breeze may never know ;
Love—-Youth—and Beauty grasp the helm,
And Life is at the prow !)
Years and years and years passed by ; their weight
had wearied me:
I went to rest an aching heart down by the sounding
sea:
Westward, the sun was sinking slow into the waiting
Deep .■
The wind, as worn with wandering, did moan itself
to sleep.
There —by the ebbing waves again, I saw them ; and
I knew
By the sad light of Evening, that each was weary too.
Oh 1 was it Ocean’s low refrain? or the wind
whispering ?
A living Hope ? or a mocking vain ? ■* Wait till my
ship comes in I”
(Poor beaten bark ! poor raggdd sails
Near is the Haven now ;
So gently Death doth touch the helm
When Life is at the prow I)

TWIXT MAN AND MAN.
>fITWIXT man and man : so let it stand :
I care not what the matter he ;
Or crossed or crowned, or blessed or banned,
Since God hath set His seal on thee.
A king thou art ? well, be it so;
Then live a king ; ’tis but a span.
A clown, thou say’st ? so let it go ;
Tis little odds, if thou’rt a man.
So ever let the matter be.
It is the simplest, noblest plan ;
“Twixt me and thee : tvvixt thee and me”
And let it stand —“twixt man and manl
’Twixt man and man ; so let it stand,
Whatever is betwixt us twain :
And I, the lord of lease and land ;
And thou, the hind on my domain,
I doff my plume ! (it is but lent,)
And now, let each the other scan ;
So, equal Fortune’s argument; —
So, sway the Right! 'twixt man and man !
So ever let, &c.
’Twixt man and man ; so let it stand
And I the hind ; the master, thou :
It is no deed of lease or land
That I can read upon thy brow ;
But Courage—Truth—and Courtesy—
The MAN—writ on that ample span ;
And I'm no serf that cannot pay
A man’s respect, ’twixt man and man,
So ever let, &c.


’Twixt man and man ; so let it stand ;
Not in the jargon of on oath :
I meet thine eye—l grasp thine hand —
And thus is staked our trust and troth ;
Nor holy dust, nor book divine
Our promises shall seal ami set !
If neither heart the truth enshrine,
Tis not in any amulet.
So ever let the matter be.
It is the simplest, noblest plan ;
" ’Twixt me and thee ; 'twixt thee and me
And let it sUnd, "twixt man and man !
'Twixt me and thee ; 'twixt lliee and me"
uid let it stand, "twixt man and man !

A WEARY WORLD.
a weary world away 1
Who, upon a wintry shore,
Heedless of the driven spray ;
Dreameth ot the days of yore ;
Dreaming, looking hack at li f e ;
Seeing, not the storm and strife ;
Neiher cypress, yew, nor thorn :
But red Roses and the May 1
Fresh the (lowers to him are borne,
Oh 1 a weary world away.
Where the boughs are bending low ;
Where the gurgling becks they plav :
Where the golden mallows blow ;
Oh 1 a weary world away,


Oh 1 a weary world away !
Summer sun, and winter rain;
Every night and every day
To the dragging of my chain,
Do I beat my weary bounds ;
Hearing, deaf to harsher sounds,
Not the murmur of the storm.
But to me the breezes stray
'Set to sweetest songs of home,
Oh ! a weary world away I
Where the boughs, &c.
Oh ! a wear}' world away !
Where the boughs are bending low ;
And the ousel winds her way,
Where the golden mallowSjblow :
And the rivulet is clear,
And the cushats’ note I hear ;
Where they stand and whisper low.
And the lips are close that say,
“ 7V,v a weary world, we know
Thou, a weary world away”
Oh 1 a weary world away 1
Is it but a glorious dream ?
Boughs of healing ever away,
Bending o’er a crystal stream :
And the mighty pteans ring
To the glory of the King 1
Crowns and Fetters down are thrown
At His feet; for aye and aye
Dried the tear, and hushed the moan,
Yes, a weary world away 1
Where the nations bend them low :
Where the living waters play :
Crowns, as Fellers, down they throw :
Yes I a weary world away I


FETTERED AND FREE.
WITH a martial clang as his scabbard rang,
Nor drawing his bridle rein,
A belted Knight, in his mailed might,
Rode cantering over the plain :
Singing a song, as he swung along,
While his glittering armour rang
To the iron beat of his charger fleet,
And this was the song he sang :
“If love be kind,
My love shall find
This heart can loyal be ;
Honor and Love
My chains shall prove ;
And fettered, I’ll be free 1”
Tho’ the fetters ring, let the prisoner sing
With as stout a heart and as bold :
If the arras he bear, and the shield he wear
Be clean as the knights, of old ;
If blade and hilt nor shame nor guilt,
And the shield be blazoned “Right I”
Let the captive try with a heart as high,
As stout a stave, as the Knight 1
“Tho’ fetters ring,
Still I can sing :
(Since free from Guilt I be;)
Oh 1 link and lock 1
Ye vainly mock,
Tho’ fettered—l am free !”


TO MAUD, IN ENGLAND.
There are /mu mho mill always believe in you, Maud and
her mother.'' —Extract fnmi her letter, received by
nu>. in ISalhiirsl).
K AM looking backward, Cousin ;
And it scarcely seems a span
Since you were but a child, dear,
And I was just a man :
When in many a childish trouble,
Yon would stand beside my knee,
And howe’er had burst the bubble,
You would tell it all to me.
“Maud 1 Maud!”
So mournfully I’d say :
And the laughter in mine eves, dear
Would drive it all away !
I am standing in the Present:
I am sickening at shame:
For I hear my fetters ringing,
As again I breathe your name;
And so bitterly, long after,
I am thinking of the day,
When my light and loving laughter
All the trouble drove away.


Maud I Maud I
If you could see me now,
Would you help me in my trouble,
As 1 helped you, long ago ?
At last 1 I face the Future,
For mine eyes are clearer now :
And the Fear has left my heart,
As the Frown has left ray brow :
There is Hope, and Help, and Healing,
In the burden of the sea :
The clouds away are stealing ;
And there’s light again for me !
Maud! Maud 1
The tears, so far away,
Have glistened in your eyes, child,
To help my heart, to-day I
For you know, despite the fetters,
I have never earned the shame ;
And you trust me : and you hold me ;
And you love me, just the same I
The light and loving laughter
You have kept through all the years,
And you give it back, long after,
In a priceless gift of Tears !
Maud 1 Maud 1
My prayers are but few ;
But (here never was a purer
Than the one I keep for you I

NEW. WORDS TO AN OLD TUNE
(“the ole abbey ruins”)
N the gloaming I stray by a shadowy way
J*. To the wreck of an old Abbey grey ;
To the hills in the west the sun sinks to rest,
The throstle she pipes her last lay :
To the old ruin grey I am bending my way,
For one there is waiting for me ;
The blush on her cheek, her loving eyes speak
That she loveth, she loveth but me !
Moonbeams above
Hallowed our love ;
Night only knew of our wooing :
Shadow and gleam,
Haunting the stream,
Down by the old Abbey Ruin 1
Now the moon reigns; and silent the strains
Of the birds, save the nightingales lay ;
And we two linger still by the rippling rill,
Near the old Abbey, ruined and grey.
Her gentle head rests on its pillow, my breast,
Each beat of her heart I can feel;
How trembles her frame, as I whisper her name 1
How sweet are (he kisses I steal 1
Moonbeams above, &c,
Never more shall I stray by the old Abbey grey,
Never meet thee again, ay di me !
By the light of the moon to the nightingales tune
Never more shall I listen with thee :
No more feel the warm loving clasp of your arms:
No more thy sweet face shall I see ;
Like a dream of the night at the breaking of light
Thou art vanished and lost, love, to me.
Moonbeams above, &c.


But ever I keep in my heart’s deepest deep,
The mem’ry, the image of thee :
And my eyes fill with tears, as I look thro' the
years,
And the old ruined Abbey I see;
The nightingale’s trill; and the silvery rill;
The gloam of the mellow moonshine :
The shadowy wav ; and the old Abbey grey,
My heart shall for ever enshrine.
Moonbeams above
Hallowed our love
Night only knew of our wooing
Shadow and gleam
Haunting the stream;
Down by the old Abbey Ruin !
RANK AND FILE.
(a song op iteration)
CO him whose title's blazoned clear
Upon the scroll of Fame ;
Soldier or sage, or pleb or peer,
Be Honor, note, and name :
But let me sing the ruck, who bear
The burden and the toil ;
Greatest of all who nobly dare
And do—the Rank and File.
Let Fame her clarion ring
For all who catch her smile ;
While we together sing
A round to Rank and File !


I would not filch one glancing gem
From Mitre, Cross, or Crown :
The ireeman who dishonors them,
Assails his own renown.
Nor of one little leaf would I
A laurelled brow despoil;
Green be the bays 1 they cannot die,
If weft of Rank and File.
Let Fame, &c.
Right royal never shone a crown ;
Nor knightly e’er a spur :
But through the listening ages, down
Some song, to live for e'er;
But tell me, if the stirring beat
Of such a strain beguile
Are there no echoes just as sweet
With truths of Rank and File ?
Let fame, &c.
Hark I ’tis two hundred years ago
Since, in Westminster’s Hall,
The Fathers stood, for Holy Rood,
Resolved to stand, or fall;
And the rude shout that smote a King.
And bade Trelawney smile ;
Lives on, in freemen’s hearts to ring
A round to Rank and File.
Let fame, &c.
When Scotland thrills to Wallace wight,
To Bruce and Bannockburn ;
Ho ! for the ringing claymores bright,
That reddened round the kerne 1
“On Nolan, on ! the guns I the guns !
Hears Erin not, meanwhile,
The triumph of her deathless sons
Who knit the Rank and File ?
Let fame, &c.


O’er shores that stretch to sunlit seas ;
O'er Arctic’s nil bless snows ;
There floats to the eternal breeze,
As free a flag as blows ;
A golden crown, Columbia, thine
For svery toil-won mile ;
Thy kings by right that is divine,
Right from the Rank and File !
Let Fame, &c
If storied scutcheons may not grace
Thee, Queen of Southern Seas 1
Thy Bayards bore, a sturdy race,
The nobler shields of Peace.
0 ! maik Australia’s cities rise-
Australia’s harvests smile,
Where the blue heavens but cloud to kiss
The spoils of Rank and File !
Let Fame, &c,
Tis meet that men of such a breed
Ever together climb :
Ever the first with dauntless tread,
To wake the wastes of time :
Not crash of nations, creeds, or kings,
Shall herald us the spoil,
But, to true notes of better things,
The march of Rank and File.
Let Fame, Ac
So runs my rhyme ; and not in vain,
If ye will heed who hear;
Tho’ Honor ever love the van.
She’ll not forsake the rear;
Then, glitter, lance, and golden spur I
Good broadsword, cleave the whilej
Pie'll tarry not in peace or war,
Who’ll lead the Rank and File I
Let Fame, &c,


HALCYON DAYS.
HKN the cuckoo calls; and the snowdrop
VWStI trembles ;
And the violet nods to the bursting sprays :
When the laughing year his mirth dissembles
In the radiant rains of his halcyon days :
By bridle paths be love-lit ways
Sing Hey ! for halcyon days,
When the laden boughs lie low on the river,
And the lusty trout in the shallows plays;
When the scythe is set, and lush is the clover:
And the broo I hath 11 twn, in the halcyon days,
By cover and copse be love-lit ways 1
Sing 1 ley ! for halcyon days 1
When the barley bows, and the reaper bindeth,
The red fox steals by crafty ways :
When the kingfisher nests where Yoredale whuieth
In the golden hush of the halcyon days :
Where sheaves be stocked arc love-lit ways
Sing Hey 1 for halcyon days 1
When the wold is white, and the well is frozen,
The latch is snecked to the Yule-log’s blaze:
When the red-breasl Laps, an’ he would be housen
Till the spring come back with the halcyon days :
The rnisletoe hath love-lit ways,
Sing Hey ! for halcyon days!


What tho’ in the drear Decembers,
Dark be the light of bridal Mays ?
God no ashes gives, but embers,
Cradling light of cloudless days.
Light hath He for darkest ways :
Sing Hey ! for halcyon days !
Cold an’ the stone of my living grave is,
Never so dark be my prisoned ways ;
Hope can creep thro’ a little crevice
To bid me sing of the halcyon days 1
“Sigh no more 1 ' ! Hope to me says
“ Sing Hey ! for halcyon days I”

TO AUSTRALIA.
chaos fell: and lo ! there burned
The lamp of life and light;
’Ere first the day, declining, turned
To folds of virgin night;
And the moon, amidst a myriad slaves,
To glittering empire sprang—
O'er shores that glowed to lustrous waves,
The winds, enchanted, sang
Australia 1
Australia 1
Floreat Aust»alia I
When that first gentle sunbeam kissed
The shadows from thy brow,
And bade the last and lingering mist
Thy loveliness allow;
Thy destiny was graven clear:
Thy name was written plain :
And so, by wood, and wold, and mere,
The sirens’ changeless strain,
Australia!
Australia I
Floreat Australia I
And tho’ a thousand ages prone,
In thy primeval sleep,
And ocean still unbroken aone
Would round thy beauty keep ;
The Wanderer, whom heaven’s decree
Designed thee to belong,
Time's secret from the silent sea
Hath wrest, to swell the song
Australia 1
Australia I
Floreat Australia 1


And now, no more the ages hush
A slumb’ring southern sphere ;
O’er wild and waste, thro' brake and bush
Reveil hath echoed clear;
Thy broken fastnesses prolong
The notes that set thee free,
As to the rhythm of thy song,
The axe rings on the tree,
Australia 1
Australia!
Floreat Australia I
Where Solitude, supremely sad
Had hushed the lock’d lagoon ;
Where ’neath thine eucalyptus-shade,
The savage dreamed at noon ;
The wand hath waved ; the argosy
Beckons to mart and mine ;
The city roars ; the laughing lea
Throbs to the corn and vine,
Australia 1
Australia I
Floreat Australia !
Vain be the jealous hands of man
To compass thy design;
Thy measure is thine ocean’s span,
And that thy boundary line :
Glitter on thine encircling sea,
Inviolable gem 1
Whose golden girth hath chartered thee
One Nation, Land, and Name,
Australia I
Australia I
Floreat Australia I
When lo ! the solem hush of night
Is on thy starlit sea ;
You matchless diadem of light
A sign is set for thee;


Oh 1 may as steadfast, leal ,and pure,
Thine heirs themselves ordain ;
Then shalt thou flourish and endure
Unto the living strain,
Australia!
Australia !
Floreat Australia!
YOREDALE.
(a. SONG OE home)
/JSUEKN waved the woods of Yoredale.
The thrush was singing clear ;
I turned my back on Yoredale,
In the hey-day of the year ;
The hells of Masham steeple
(A melting threnody,)
O’er the river’s broken ripple
Rang a last farewell to me.
Woe worth the day, oh, Yoredale !
I turned my back on thee—
When the bells of Masham steeple
Rang a last farewell to me.
But oh 1 when life is springing,
There's magic in the air;
And a rune is ever ringing,
Whose promises are fair


And the glorious golden city
One must surely go and see ;
And sweetest spells of Yoredale
Were spells no more for me.
Woe worth the day &c.
Now in the glittering city
Is but a weary maze ;
Nor heed, nor help, nor pity
Can I find in all the ways.
And a felon blow hath smitten,
In the dust hath stricken me ;
And broken, bruised, and beaten,
Yoredale ! I turn to thee I
Woe worth the day, oh Yoredale !
I turned my back on thee :
When the bells of Masham steeple
Rang a last farewell to me.
THO’ ALL THE WORLD.
(TO MAIIY H.)
/fTVER many a mile ’twixt you and me
The stars may wax and wane ;
The sun may set on land and sea,
The year grow old again ;
Your glance the northern mist may greet,
And mine, a southern ray ;
A world divide our wand’ring feet,
Yet we have met to-day.


For tho’ the tide may ebb and flow,
And years may wax and wane :
Tho’ all the world divide, 1 know
Our hearts are met again I
Oh I never sang the thrush so sweet,
Nor scented was the flower;
As when we bent our careless feet
Along the banks of Yore ;
’Tis twenty years since, lass and lad,
We crossed the wooded hill;
The son x is hushed : the flower dead ;
And we forgather still!
For thro’ the tide &c.
As here a prisoner I sigh,
And there you lonely be ;
The dream that brings you company,
Shall tell me I am free I
Away ! the weight of years (lies,
And, boy and girl, by Yore,
With simple hearts and loyal eyes,
Are hand-in-hand once more I
For tho’ the tide &c.
Oh I it your pity bridge an earth,
And these stern stones be riven
By your bright tears’ unselfish worth,
Your prayers may reach to Heaven I
And Heaven may bless the hopes that ding
To memories so sweet:
And cares may cross, and fetters ring,
And we again may meet 1
Yes 1 tho’ the tide may ebb and flow,
And years may wax and wane :
Tho’ all the world divide us now,
We two may meet again 1


ALWAY.
sweet is the melody, that thrills to-nigh*'
*l|» the ancient hall;
Soft a thousand tapers gleam to kiss the grim arms
on the wall:
Flash the sconces ; whirls the dance, and thrills the
measure’s melting swell ;
Pure as the snow of a maiden's breast, without, the
moon keeps sentinel.
Feather light are the little feet, that tripping, tripping,
seem to fly .•
As folded to her lover’s heart a, dainty lady glideth by.
Oh ! ’tis meet that the tale be told of stalwart strength
to yielding grace ;
Never so new and ever so old from the lips of love to
a lady’s face I
Rend thee low o'er the little head;
let the broken words he said;
There , where the trembling shadow of night
Veil her broiu from the grareless light,
Reverent homage kneeling pay ;
‘■Mine?” “Thine!” “Alwayi”
The night is dark, and through the hall the twinkling
tapers gleam no more ;
Nor waif of tender melody pants fainting o’er the
silent shore,
Only the burden of the wind, that quavers as it soughs
along,
Over the moor, and over the mere, singing a sad
uncertain song.


Just as the ring of the leaping trout vanish upon the
moat below.
Vanish'd are dame and cavalier: gone are the lights
and music now I
Where is the spell of the blushing face, that upturned,
met you looking down ?
Where are the troth and the tryst you said ? love, you
hail died to call your own ?
Sure, T hear the. night breeze say ;
“ Where is the swirl of driven spray ?
Where is the old moon's vanished ray P"
Solemn words to he said, I wot;
Pledge for ever, to-night forgot:
"Mine ? Thine 1 Alway /" ’


A LAY OF LAMBTON.
These lines 'were written on the insia.Ua.iion in
Lambion of the electric tight:
3&0 I fathers of the people ! every aldermanic swell
Who ’neath the glorious skies of Australasia
mav dwell :
Each portly Mayor, each Alderman, Townclerk or
C.P.S.,
Each M.L.A. and M.L.C., P.M. or A.S.S,
Give ear unto the poean that your modern Homer rings,
A lay of fair Lambtonia : (nor blind the bard that sings:)
And you long suffering rate-payers, who pipers have
to pay,
Come, listen how at Lambton, they can turn night
into day.
In serried ranks are standing the posts about the town :
To right; to left, to north, to south, east, west, and up
and down :
There are posts that guard Karoola, that stately
Appian way ;
From Council house to Jakey Dent’s will shine
Electra’s ray I
Ho ! patres populorum ! your names we’ll ever bless,
And pray your lights and shadows may ne’er be any
less:
And lifted high a bumper, we will pledge you every one,
May every year that passes find you still as good as
*Young:
May you never change your Goddess ; to Electra still
be true :
In all her dazzling beauty may she still be true to
you;
King gas asphyxiated, fair Electra reign complete
And if gas be in the Council, may it ne’er be in the
street!
{* Note. Young was the first town in N.S.W. to adopt
this system of lighting.


Sing Ho ! the mighty banquet all at ten and six ahead :
Sing Hev 1 the tasty viands all upon the table spread :
Sing Ho ! the sparkling speeches of each sprig of
Parliament;
Sing Hi 1 Contractor Kingsbury ; Hurrah 1 for Mayor
Dent I
But never from our memories let the days of darkness
Hit;
When we splodged along *Karoola, when we splashed
in *Dixon street;
When we prayed and swore alternate, when in # Dog
and Rat aground.
And the kerosene-tinf shed its gentle halo all aronn i 1
What i r , within the cycle, and the town shall be no
more;
The dusky miner vanished since his occupation’s
o'er
What if her veil Futurity shall lift and show us bent,
O’er the ruins of Rotunda, the shade of Mayor Dent,
With bony hand outstretching, and with slow and
weary feet
Faltering, ’midst the wrecks of Lambtou, up and
down each lonely street:
When vanished, too the land shark : and the land
courts lost to si^ht;
Gone town and trade, and mine and men, and gone,
Electric light ?
But no 1 A brighter Future, of this modest hard the
tip,
When Electra rules the mart, the mine, the wharf, the
store, the ship;
(*A succession of man traps known in Lambtou as streets),
{Pending the establishment of the light, rates were
charged on a judicious arrangement of kerosene tins,
each containing a candle, (fact.)
{How long before Lambtou coal is worked out ?


She will shave us ; she will shrive us : blow our noses
cut our hair:
Make our boots and shoes and shine ’em ; cut the
very clothes we wear;
She will school us ; she will rule us: boil the pot, and
bake the bread ;
She will carry us, and marry us, and bury us when
dead :
Wallop Billy when he wants it; nurse the baby ; brew
the tea :
And we’ll be hatched, and thatched and batched
by Electricity r
