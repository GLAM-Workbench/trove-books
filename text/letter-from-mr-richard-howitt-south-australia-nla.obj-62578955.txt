ing scale of duties. That they view with horror and
aversion the proposition of an atrocious measure framed
for the purpose of plundering the mass of the people in
perpetuity?a measure which will be execrated and ought
to be firmly resisted by every honest man; which is directly
opposed to the beneficent intentions of an all-wise Provi-
dence, and is calculated to despoil the toiling millions of
the fruits of their honest industry, and reduce them to
starvation, for the benefit of a grasping and rapacious
aristocracy .?
This, it seems, is ? not stronger than the occasion
demands.? Pray what is ?
Burning the Effigy of Sir Robert Peel, in Derby.
?The Derby Reporter , in describing this exhibition, says.
? As the procession passed the Mercury Office the yelling
was deafening.? We have no doubt that the writer of
this paragraph was one of the yellers, and that he would
have been exceedingly glad to have done something mere
than yell , had an opportunity presented itself.
Feargus O?Connor in Derby. ?Pursuant to public
notice, this gentleman visited Derby yesterday, for the
purpose of giving a lecture on what is called ? The
People?s Charter,? at the Theatre. A carriage, drawn by
four greys, preceded by a band of music and green flags,
and a procession, amounting to near a thousand persons
met him at the Railway Station at J past three, where he
arrived from Nottingham, in which town he had addressed
a large concourse of persons in the Market-place the day
before. He was escorted into the town as far as
Royal Hotel, in front of which, the carriage drew up
where he briefly harrangued the crowd. At seven o?clock
Mr. O?Connor attended at the Theatre, which was
tolerably well filled; the admission being 6d. 4d. and 2d.
A chairman (a person named Nott) was appointed, and
resolutions were adopted after speeches by several
chartists. Mr. O?Conner then addressed the assembly at
considerable length on the usual topics, when the meeting
broke up, and the people peaceably dispersed.
Her Majesty the Queen Dowager. ?Her Majesty,
we are happy to state, progresses favourably towards the
restoration of health.
The Derbyshire members who voted on Lord J. Russell?s
Amendment are as follows:?
AGAINST. FOR.
C. R. Colvile. Hon. G. H. Cavendish.
E. M. Mundy. W. Evans.
Hon. J. G. Ponsonby.
E. Strutt.
There were 28 Liberals and 8 Tories absent from the
division, without having paired off.
Archidiaconau Board of Education. ?A Meeting
of the Board of Education, for the Achdeaconry of Staf-
ford, was held at Lichfield, on Tuesday, 15th inst., for
the purpose of making grants in aid of the objects of the
society, and of receiving the first annual statement of its
proceedings. It appears that out of its limited, but, we
are happy to add, growing funds, it has granted, at the
four quarterly meetings which have taken place since its
formation in Jan. 1841, aid towards the erection of nine
schools in the county, and providing books for one of
them, assistance in augmenting the stipend of two mas-
ters, besides providing efficient inspection for all schools
desirous of it, and granting exhibitions &c., to two pupils
training at the Diocesan School at Lichfield.?The Arch-
deacon, as president, occupied the chair, and the Dean of
Lichfield, with several other clergymen were present.
An abstract of the proceedings of the Board, with an ac-
count of receipts and expenditure, will appear in the next
report of the Diocesan Board of Education?the annual
meeting of which will take place, we understand, in
Easter week, at Lichfield.
The Earl of Lichfield has broken up his establishments
at Shugborough, Ranton Lodge, and St. Jame?s-square,
the family intending to travel on the Continent for two
or three years.
Fine Arts.? ln a Review of Pictures now exhibiting
in the British Institution, London, The Literary Gazette ,
and Journal of the Belles Lettres , thus describes the fol-
lowing:? ? No. 9. An Italian Beggar Boy. T. Ellerby.
After the manner of Murillo, and painted with consider-
able taste and expression. 35. Medora; and 399. A Lady
dressing for a Masquerade , by the same, are favourable
specimens of his art.? Mr. T. Ellerby, the Artist, is now
on a visit at Derby, painting Portraits, and we are glad to
say he has met with great encouragement. The feeling
and delicacy of his Ladies? Portraits are much admired,
as well as being striking likenesses. Some groups of
children are also well drawn and finely coloured.
Banking Company. ?The eighth annual meeting of
the Chesterfield and North Derbyshire Banking Company
was held at the Angel Inn, Chesterfield, on Monday the
14th inst., when a very favourable report of the state of
its affairs was presented by the Directors. A dividend of
per cent, was declared for the past year, which left 21
per cent, of the profit to be placed to the credit of the re-
served fund. The Proprietors present were unusually
numerous, and evinced their satisfaction by uanimously
re-electing the whole of the Directors, and by voting a
handsome sum in testimony of the sense they entertained
of their past services.
At a board meeting, held at Derby, on Tuesday the
15th inst, Anthony Titley, Esq., of Wortley Lodge, near
Leeds, was elected Deputy Chairman of the North Mid-
land Railway, in the place of James Hubbard, Esq.,
deceased.
It is rather uncertain at what period Derbyshire was
represented in Parliament. But there is no doubt that it
sent thither two Knights as early as the twenty-third of
Edward 1., in the persons of Henry de Kniveion and
Giles de Meynell.
On Sunday last, an excellent and appropriate sermon
was preached in the parish church Chesterfield, by th*e
Rev. Valentine Green, M. A., rector of Berkin, Yorkshire,
after which the sum of 161. 2s. was collected in aid of the
Chesterfield district visiting society.
Ilam. ?Collected in the parish of Ham, after a sermon
by the Rev. Frederick Day, in compliance with the Queen?s
letter, in aid of the Society for the propagation of the
Gospel in Foreign Parts, the sum of 211. 12s.
Oodnor and Loscoe. ?The distribution of clothing to
the value of 71. ss. to the poor of the parish of Heanor,
including the townships of Codnor and Loscoe, the muni-
ficent annual bequest of the late Rev. Francis Gisborne,
having been delayed till last week, the principal inhabi-
tants of the latter hamlets, sympathising with the distressed
state of the poor residing there, determined to raise a
small subscription in addition to their portion of the said
bequest. This was entered into with the greatest alacrity,
and 41. 18s. promptly obtained. By these means 40 of
the most destitute individuals were furnished with one or
more necessary articles of clothing each. Messrs. Good-
will and Griffin also, with a kindness and liberality truly
laudable, gratuitously supplied 16 poor families with about
half a ton of coals each.
On Shrove Tuesday there was a meeting at the
Wesleyan Chapel, Tansley, when near 200 persons par-
took of tea, after which the audience was addressed by the
Rev. J. Pearce and others. Thanks were due to Mrs.
Hackett, Mrs. Calow, and other ladies, on this interesting
occasion, for their kind exertions.
Geological Discovery'. ?We have seen in the posses-
sion of Mr. Hall, at the Marble Works, in this town, a
very interesting specimen of geology. It is a large fossil
tooth, most likely of the Mastodon, and is in a fine state
of preservation. The enamel parts of the tooth are per-
fectly silicified; the other parts of it are not so much in-
durated. The whole is beautifully stratified, exhibiting
various degrees of hardness, clearly shewing that it be-
longed to a gigantic herbivorous animal. Not the least
interesting part of this ancient relic of the antidiluvian
world is theloeality ; it having been found in the alluvium
in this neighbourhood.

Chapel-en-le-Frith. ?The annual winter relief fund
of Chapel-en le- Frith (as it now may be termed, being
the contributions of some benevolent individuals for the
purpose of alleviating in some degree the privations which
may be felt among the labouring classes in that neighbour-
hood,) is in course of distribution. The original promo-
ter of this charitable aid is the Rev. William Bagshaw,
who has for several years back at this season of the year,
put into the hands of the minister of the place thirty
pounds to be given by him to families whom he saw
might be in need of such aid, and through the kind exer-
tions of the present minister, the Rev. G. Hall, several
donations are now added to the fund. Among the number
of the present year, W. Thornhill, Esq., of Ollerenshaw
House, has contributed to its support in a manner highly
characteristic of his benevolent disposition. The relief is
given weekly in oatmeal and coals, and the committee
who kindly undertake the management of the distribution,
meet at the National School each Saturday forenoon to
issue tickets to deserving objects. The distribution com-
menced the first week in January, and will continue while
the fund will allow it. The claims upon the committee
for the present year are more numerous, not only on
account of the general scarcity of employment among
out-door workers, but because the power loom mill has
been standing now two months, besides the late lament-
able fire of the Waterside factory, which has caused many
of the hands to be in a state of destitution. We regret to
understand that the fund is greatly reduced, and will soon
be quite exhausted, unless further aid be obtained from
some source or other, which would be very acceptable
under present circumstances.

The Wolverhampton Branch of the Dudley and Mid-
land Geological Society held their first general meeting
on, Friday se?nnight, when the opening address, embrac-
ing an account of the minerals of the district, which was
delivered by Mr. Jukes, was ordered to be printed and
deposited amongst the papers of the Society.
Nearly all the cotton manufacturers of Stockport and
neighbourhood have given notice to reduce the wages of
almost all description of hands in their employ.
Fowls Stolen. ?ln the night of Friday last, the out-
buildings belonging to Mr. John Wragge, farmer of Calow
Green, near Chesterfield, were broken open, and upwards
of 20 fowls stolen therefrom. A reward of ten guineas
(over and above what is allowed by the Chesterfield as-
sociation) is offered by Mr. Wragge, on the conviction
of the offenders. We have before had to remark on the
prevalence of fowl stealing in the neighbourhood of Ches-
terfield, and are sorry that the depredators still continue
their nefarious practices with impunity.

Wednesday night, for the purpose of exhibiting, as they
express it, their detestation of the right hon. baronet?s
proposed change in the sliding scale of duties by burning
him in effigy. The timely interference of the police,
however, prevented their carrying this part of their plan
into execution, although it did not succeed in allaying
their propensity for mischief; for no sooner did they find
themselves thwarted in this particular than they betook
themselves to the house of Mr. J. Marshall (a gentleman
recently appointed to the magistracy and a Tory), and
demolished the whole of his windows, amounting to some
80 or 100 panes. Not satisfied with the work of destruc-
tion here, they turned their attention next to the Town-
hall adjoining, where in the course of a few minutes they
succeeded in completely battering the whole of the win-
dows in. By this time it was found necessary to send to

BIRMINGHAM AND DERBY RAILWAY.
On Thursday last a deputation from the Alstonefield
Incorporation, in the county of Stafford, consisting of
John Oakden, Esq., the Chairman, and Mr. John White,
one of the Guardians of the Incorporation, had an inter-
view with John Walter, Esq., the late representative for
Nottingham, and presented to him an address from the
Incorporation, expressing their thanks to Mr. Walter for
his zealous exertions in the cause of humanity, in the firm
and continued opposition he has offered to the oppressive
enactments of the New Poor Law. The address, signed
by Sir Henry Fitzherbert, Bart., the Visiter, John Har-
rison, Esq., Deputy Visiter of the Incorporation, and the
whole of the Guardians, was placed in a very neat and
suitable frame, and is to the following effect: ?

A half-yearly general meeting of the Shareholders in
the Birmingham and Derby Railway took place on Wed-
nesday morning, at the Waterloo Rooms, Birmingham ;
Henry Smith, Esq., in the chair.
After the usual preliminary business, the Chairman
read the Report, which stated that between the 30th of
June and the 31st of December, 1841, 90,640 passengers
were carried on tills railway without accident, making,
since the opening of the railway, a total of 411,390.
The amount received for passenger traffic in the last
half-year has been 24,9201. 3s. 2d., and for merchandize,
8,0221. 7s, Bd., making a total of .32,9421. 10s. 10d., be-
ing an increase on the previous half-year of 4,8751. 6s. 2d.
(or 17 per cent.) and au increase on the corresponding
period of 1840 of 9 per cent. Pursuing the same mode of
comparison as heretofore adopted, it appears that the in-
crease in the local trade in the last half-year, beyond that
of the same period in 1840, has been 16 per cent.; this
arises from the carriage of the mail and an increase of
merchandize and minerals. The addition from the latter
items of merchandize and minerals amounts to 17 per
cent, over the last half-year, and to this the Directors
refer as exhibiting that gradual increase which they have
anticipated from improved accommodation. That the
passenger traffic has not increased the directors attribute
to the continued inconvenience of the circuitous route by
Hampton, and to the disastrous state of the trade of this
district and the country generally. The subsidence of the
embankments being now materially lessened, and the
other works of the line being more settled, it is believed
that the expenditure for the maintenance of way may be
start was to take place at one o?clock, and shortly after-
wards the horses and riders were on the ground. Mr.
Villiers sporting the colours of Lord Chesterfield, red and
blue, with red cap ; Lord Maidstone, buff and purple with
a black cap. After the usual preliminaries of weighing,
saddling, and mounting, both riders being on the qui vive,
the start took place at a few minutes past three o?clock,
and for the first few fields the fences were taken together.
Lord Maidstone then inclined to the left, avoiding a nasty
drop leap, and a flight of rails, but taking rather a wide
sweep of ground in his gallop. Mr. Villiers went straight,
and his mare took everything in her stride, and he was
the first over the brook, which both did cleverly, crossing
the Packington-lane. Lord Maidstone went on the wrong
side a flag, which he ought to have kept on his right
hand, and he therefore had to turn back ; the ground thus
lost he never could recover, and though he rode most
gallantly and came into the winning field very little
behind his opponent, finding ivhen he loosed his horse
he had no chance of winning, he very judiciously pulled
up, and Mr. Villiers went in a winner about twenty
lengths.
Tbanspobtation of Jersey Felons to England.?
We mentioned in our last that a highway robber, con-
victed of four distinct felonies in Guernsey, had been
sentenced to be transported to England; and we have
since heard that he is to be shipped to Southampton, and
there let loose on the community. He is said to he a
most expert burglar, and can pick a look equal to Black
Dick, who was some years ago hung at Salisbury; but
his principal forte seems to he that of a highwayman and
pickpocket?so we would advise our neighbours across
the Channel to keep a sharp look-out. ?Jersey News.

sooner than the hon. and learned member anticipated, as
his name does not appear in the division list. Three of
his relations, however, viz.?Messrs. Maurice, Morgan,
and John O?Connell (the members for Tralee, Kerry, and
Kilkenny), voted in the minority.

lives and the infliction of serious injuries to three other
persons.
The meeting was then dissolved.
OPPOSITION TO THE NEW POOR LAW.
Steamer Ashore.?On Wednesday week, the steamer
Victoria, which was between Fleetwood and Belfast, got
aground and has since gone to pieces. Her cargo, which
was valued at 15,0001., was all lost or very seriously
damaged.
Corn-law Petitions. ?The disgraceful practices re-
sorted to by the gentlemen favourable to the abolition of
the Corn-laws to procure signatures to petitions, to im-
pose on the House of Commons, and commit gross frauds
upon its privileges, are of too impudent a description to
be allowed to pass unnoticed. The exposing of the peti-
tions for signatures in gin-shops, public-houses, coffee-
houses, coffee-shops, barbers, bakers, pawnbrokers shops,
workhouses, London and the other bridges, the taking
possession of public situations, where there is a great
traffic with a table and a ? barker,? with ? Please to sign
the petition against the Corn-laws,? the attracting the
children as they come out of school by a ? decoy,? and
the placing themselves at all public meetings, bawling
out ? Who will sign the petition against the poor man?s
enemy ?? the signing the same twenty times by one per-
son, are innocent expedients in themselves compared with
the unwarrantable taking possession of large workshops,
where a great many persons are employed, with an intima-
tion from the foreman (he having been waited on in the
first instance by the party in charge of the petition, and a
gallon or so of the ? heavy? awarded for the ? influence?)
that they cannot object to sign the petition, as it will he the
means of procuring them and their families cheap bread
and higher wages, in the different parishes sending per-
sons round from house to house canvassing for signatures,
and the innocent amusement of teaching the dear little
ones (on the petition of course) to write their names back-
wards and forwards ; the gentlemen following the pro-
fession of ?corn-law signature agents,? with a fee of 2s.
per 100 names, are not alarmed at the publicity of a tap-
room in the following of their useful avocation of ? ficti-
tious name and address manufacturers.? The fraudulent
petitions professing to emanate from public meetings, and
signed by the ? chairman? on behalf of the meeting, are
a few among the countless stratagems palmed upon the
gullibility of the people. It may fairly he said that the
petitions on this subject, professing to come from the
people, through the influence of a set of low lazy agitators,
are public nuisances.

Remarkable Coincidence. ?lt is worthy of remark
that at the present period there are three countries in
Europe, the existing governments of which have just
been firmly established in power by the vote of their re-
spective Legislatures. We allude to Great Britain,
France, and Spain, all near neighbours of each other. In
Great Britain the Ministry of Sir R. Peel, have just been
confirmed in office, as it were, by the vote of an over-
whelming majority of the representatives of the people on
the important question of the Corn-laws. The very next
arrival from France brought the news of the defeat of
M. Ducos?s motion in the French Chamber of Deputies,
and the consequent accession of strength obtained by the
Ministry of MM. Soult and Guizot. Lastly, the same
post brought news from Madrid, to the effect that the
question of Ministerial strength was decided by the vote
of the Spanish Legislature on the address in favour of the
Gonzales Cabinet, which is now secure?at all events for
some time to come?from any danger of defeat.

It is believed that the Court will remain at the Royal
Pavilion a fortnight longer, when it will remove to
Windsor Castle until the Easter holidays.
We have before stated, that the occasion of the sudden
removal of the Court to Brighton was for the improvement
of the health of the Princess Royal. We are now happy
to state that Mr. Harry Blaker, the eminent surgeon of
that place, having been called in. has lanced the gums of
her Royal Highness, which has allayed the irritation, and
she has since cut three teeth. The Princess?s health is
now much improved.? Observer.
Prince Albert?s musical acquirements (says the Stan-
dard) are considerable: he is a good performer on the
violin, piano, and organ ; besides which, his Royal High-
ness has composed several works of great beauty.
The late Duke of Cleveland?s eldest son, the present
Duke, succeeds to 80,0001., a year. Lord William Pou-

the Duchess Dowager the Yorkshire estates, the house in
Grosvenor-square, and an immense amount of plate, jew-
ellery, and furniture. A large portion of the unentailed
estates in Durham go to one of his daughters. His Grace,
it is said, had 1,250,0001., in the Three-and-a-half per

a million sterling.

Curious Fact.? lt is a remarkable fact that upon the
last occasion of the present corn laws being discussed at
length in the House of Commons?viz., when Mr. Villiers
brought forward (in May 1840) his annual motion for a
committee to consider the laws relative to the importation
of foreign corn, the majority against his proposition was
exactly 123, the same as the majority by which, on Wed-
nesday night, Lord J. Russell?s amendment was thrown
out. The numbers on the occasion we allude to were
177 to 300.

Pretty good again 1 and especially that part of it which
relates to the ladies. They will pay no taxes, sweet
creatures (!) except in goods ; and we trust the collectors
will be gentle with them, and let them off easily, as all
ladies ought to be. The lords of the creation, we are
sure, will readily subscribe, rather than that a bailiff
should rudely distrain the china, the work-baskets, or the
scissors, thimbles, or needleeases of these fair politicians.
But let 11s see what says Mr. James Howie, who is a
Radical of the first water:?
? For himself he might remark, that he was no new advo-
cate of universal suffrage. Ever since 1815, since the pass-
ing of the corn bill, he had been persuaded that the great
source of all our political evils was the want of a government
truly responsible to the people, instead of a government, like
the present one, which depends on the will of the landed
aristocracy (Cheers.) He had lately happened to see, ina
bookseller?s window in this town, a print representing ? Auld
Nick' sitting in council in pandemonium; and he Could not
help conceiving the artist to have been a bit of a wag, for he
had so contrived the picture as to make it look exceedingly
like the House of Lords in 1815, at the time when the corn
makes it appearance. Walter?s letter was six months on the
way?your?s not four. Xam glad to hear from you, and also
glad to learn that you have left Nottingham. Still, in that
place of poverty there are some things not to be despised;
friendly people, ? the old familiar faces??-pleasant walks in the
neighbourhood? to Wilford and Clifton?Colwick and Brox-
towe; then there is the Artizans? Library. I fancied you
and my other Nottingham friends had forgotten me?still
you were all unforgotten?and you will find, if the ship by
which it was sent reaches England safely, that I have written
to you some months ago, enclosing a letter, unsealed, for
Tail?s Magazine. If you have any opportunity, make my
kind remembrance to Mr. Alford. lam glad to hear ? Festus?
will be followed up, the author is a true poet. You say you
will come here if I can give you any good account of this
place?any assurance that it would suit you. ? Wait a wee,?
good S , when I think well of this country I will speak
well about it?stick where you are, that is my advice?things
are never so bad but they may he worse. I shall return de-
pend upon it before long, if I live, or attempt to do so?l may,
it is possible, go to the bottom.
? Since writing the above I have taken a stroll out on the
other side of the river Yarra, amongst the old eucalyptus
trees, mimosa, wild cherry, and she-oak woods?a pleasant
walk enough, though solitary. The mimosa on the river's
margin is bursting into bloom; a profusion of pale golden
flowers, and the strong odour from it on the breeze is delici-
ous?grateful to the smell as to the sight. I would you had
been with me, for the day is beautiful?finer than an' English
autumnal day; the wind is strong?the clouds flinging quick
shadows o?er slope and glen, blent with golden sunshine. We
have heavenly days here, such as I cannot expect to have in
England; yet in England are many things that are not
obtainable here. There is no danger of my remaining in
Australia longer than is expedient: for there Unger in my
mind such things as ? old impressions. ? After all, you must
not infer that I repent coming to Australia?there is some-
thing good as well as evil in the composition of this strange
region. The climate in winter, or X may say for nine months
out of the twelve, is delightful?l prefer it to the English.
The absence of poor-rates and taxes is another circumstance
in the favour of Australia. Perhaps when I return to my
native laud it may not be so pleasant as it pictures itself to
the imagination at this distance. 1 always disliked the Eng-
lish winter, here there is little to call so; snow I have not seen
since the winter of 1838, and ice we have had only a few times
this season, once in a single night three quarters of an inch
thick; here there can be no accumulation of ice, for every
day?s warmth melts what had frozen the night previous. This
is not the country for people of small capital?men of large
fortune may here, by speculating in land, soon double it.
Labourers and common artificers may also do well, hut such
people as your correspondent and yourself are better in their
own country. What know or care this people of or for fine
nerves, your men of feeling and fancy are out of their element
here?for this race. These Port Phillipians (no small portion
of whom have been transported) are a hard-souled and hard-
visiged generation.
? If you are at Leicester when I return we must look over
the Abbey and visit Bradgate-park together, it will be a
pleasant ramble.
? O, for such a place as this in England ! half of it my own,
95 acres of land and a pretty cottage standing near the plea-
santest river, looking down upon the pleasantest valley ima-
ginable, just upon the brow of a circular slope, with open
expanses of the finest country-ranges of woody hills bounding
the prospect north and south, the vale of the Yand winding
east and west. Could I just drop down with this in the vale
of the Trent, how thankful should 1 be; I must, however,
leave it; do you believe with regret? Yes, with unfeigned
regret; for I have spent many months of the most active en-
joyment ; still I shall leave it, for there is in dear Old Eng-
land a much larger proportion of real and preponderating
good.
? Send my friendly regards to all the good people of my ac-
quaintance at Sneinton and Nottingham, or such of them as
you know. You imagine us wandering about in search of
adventures, and wish we may escape the Quixotish and San-
cho Panzaish buffettings and blanketings?thank you; all
the adventures we have met with are not many; nor then,
have they been of our own seeking for, ?such as ranging some
30 miles and back into the country; hushing it out all night
by the rushing and lulling sound of a small river, wrapped in
an oppossum rug, with the stars twinkling overhead, and a
blazing fire before us, surrounded by strange sights and
sounds in the darkness, the solitary howl of the wild dog, the
bickerings of the Tuan and its plop plop from tree to tree ;
the ranges wild and wide in the stringy hark forest, I have
lately taken with our bullock driver and the team, holding
broken chat with the dusky natives; these and a night spent
on the sea beach, like as many natives, round a blazing fire of
wood, some six or seven of us, feasting ourselves with wine
and tea, and dampers, are nearly all the adventures we can
boast of; no ? dangers in the imminent deadly breach? have
we to boast of.
