1 GAZED on a lovely garden
to-day.
Where flowers of every hue held
sway,
The scent of the gums was in the
air.
But my heart was heavy with
care.
The butterflies danced and the
magpies sang,
The dear little bellbirds? notes
just rang.
What folly to be a discord there,
So I laughed,
And joy filled the air.

The fairy folk are all departing.
And the forest is damp and still
The dawn is creeping o?er the hilltop
To the sound of a distant trill.
Methought I heard the yellow robin.
Or was it the Australian thrush?
Perhaps it was the kookaburra.
Or whipbird deep down in the bush
Impudent fellow this mocking-bird,
As he mimics his mates on high.
His own charming spng rings through the
trees
And echoes far into the sky
His shimmering lyre of silver hue.
As he sways and dances on mound.
Is a wonderful sight to behold.
As he sweeps it up from the ground.
Sing on you beautiful forest bird;
Let Bush-land hear you the day long
Tall gum trees are swaying in the breeze.
The glory of love is in song.


.A S one door shuts another opens,
It always has been so;
Then put your faith in God and
trust Him,
Do not let doubt be your foe


An old bush track, a gurgling
stream.
Winding its way to the sea.
The happy laughter of children.
What joy for you and me.
The simple pleasures of this world.
Are here for all mankind,
Do not waste the golden moments.
Life is so short, you?ll find.


It has a pretty, tre
A song, and its favourite
are shrubs and the ec
i water-courses.

The bush birds all day long are
singing.
Their concert is on the air.
And flute-like notes of pleasing
sweetness.
From their throats ring every-
where.
They?re telling us that joy and
gladness.
Always on this earth should
reign.
Then let us banish hate and
sadness,
So that Peace will e?er remain.

Life is not easy for anyone,
There?s always sunshine ?then

If you make the most of the
sunshine,
You must reap more joy than
pain.

FLOWERS in all their radiant
glory.
Ever tell to me a story.
They speak of love, and friend-
ship, too.
And Memories sweet they
awake anew.


Come along in and see my
dahlias.
I said to a passer-by
The v?re so very large, and so very
' tall,
But all she said was, Oh My!
You really should see my fine
dahlias,
Pop in when you re passing by.
They're so FRIGHTFULLY large!
and SO FRIGHTFULLY tall!
So I just said, Oh-Oh My!

A SMILE is health.
A smile is wealth,
So smile along your way.
Don?t watch the clouds.
Look for the Sun,
And joy you?ll find each day
