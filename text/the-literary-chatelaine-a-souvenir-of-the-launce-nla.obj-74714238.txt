PREFACE.
This little work, which we have here the honour to introduce to a
generous and discerning Tasmanian public?is, as its title implies, a
collection of trifles. In the middle ages, when the lady of the castle
attended personally to her domestic establishment, and when those
cunning devices of the milliner ?dress pockets?had not been
fashioned, some invention, it was evident, was required for the
purpose of supporting the heavy and numerous keys, the scent
box, and other articles of necessity or convenience, required by the
bustling dame of those days. This instrument, wrought doubt-
less by some skilled armourer ?to which was attached such grave
and weighty responsibilities, became in time, indispensable to the
dignity and rule of the Chatelaine ?taking from her, indeed, her very
title; it was henceforth called the ? Chatelaine.? ?In the unceasing
round of fashion,'the Chatelaine, which for many a year had dis-
appeared, has again recently come into vogue, no longer (alas for
modem degeneracy!) serving the useful purposes for which it once
was formed, but now revived as an article of luxury, an object on
which to suspend all sorts of quaint and fantastic ornaments.
Some of these, indeed, have a remote reference to utility, or the
past with which they are connected; others are mere fanciful
vagaries, in gold a)nd gems, known as breloques. Fairy keys,
miniature snuffers, mimic fruit-knives, liliputian nutmeg-graters,
tiny viniagrettes; all these have we seen suspended glittering from
a lady?s Chatalaine. Or to quote from Albert Smith, who has
written a pleasant chapter on this very subject


? Charms of other climes and ages.
Still possessing unknown powers;
Fairy knife to cut the pages.
That shall wile the summer hours.
Locket quaint, or by-gone token,
Hanging by a golden chain;
With the old coin bent or broken,
From your Chatelaine.?
Now, dear reader, we would wish that this our Chatelaine ?
which you may here purchase for the modest sum of 3s. 6d.?
should partake of the characteristics of both by-gone and present
Chatelaines. We trust that it may prove as useful (in regard to
its object) and as respect-worthy, if not so cumbrous and unorna-
mental as its ancient godmother; and we hope that you will find it
as elegant and amusing, though not quite so purposeless as its
modern namesake. At any rate, you will kindly remember, that
we lay claim to nothing higher or grander than our title implies?
that we do not invite your wondering inspection of a mass of
bullion carefully secreted in the Bank of England, nor of a splendid
regalia, jealously watched by beef-eaters in the Tower of London,
nor of a magnificent service of plate, as displayed in the windows
of many a silversmith in the Strand; but we hold forth to your
view a simple Chatelaine?some score of articles of more or less
value?but all of genuine Tasmanian workmanship.
To drop the figure, we trust that our readers will be pleased
and gratified, even should they meet with no vast treasures of wit
and wisdom in our little volume; and we hope that this, the first,
may not prove the only attempt of the kind. Perchance in turning
over these leaves, dear reader, you may light upon a paper written
by a friend, which you can trace to some happy suggestion of your
own; perchance you may discover the tale, part of which you


yourself transcribed; nay, even your own little poem, which you
in doubt and trembling forwarded to the unknown Editor. \on
will feel how the charm of the book is increased by this kind of
interest, you will understand how we yet linger over our labour of
love, our task of editorship, reluctant to bring it to a close. Here
is the contribution of our timid friend, who is so fearful of being
recognised, as to write in a carefully disguised hand; here are the
articles of our self-complacent friend, who offers us stately hints
for the proper management of our task, and confidently requests
proofs of his contributions to be sent to some outlandish country-
place ; here are the swe'et and simple poems of our modest friend,
who ?hardly expects that they will be worthy of our volume;
here is the bulky tale of our kind and encouraging doctor, who
sends it with an explanation that it was written years ago, half
fearful lest the public, unaware of this fact, should deem such light
writing, incompatible with his present grave walk in life.
We say we cannot help calling these our friends, though we may
have never seen or exchanged a word with one of them.
To each and to all who have assisted us in our undertaking, who
have ever written us one cheering lineI?to 1 ?to these and it is with a
proud and grateful heart we remember they are so many-we bid
our thanks and
Farewell.


ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS,
G. N. M.?Our poetical contributors, with but three or four ex-
ceptions, all appear intensely devoted to their native or adopted
land, Tasmania. Witness the following glowing panegyric?
? Fair isle ! thou garden of the Southern sphere,
Where nature?s beauties are profusely spread ;
And sweetest fragrance pervades the air,
Which rise spontaneous from thy flowery bed.?
But the ? fair isle,? and the readers of the Chatelaine also, must
remain contented with this single verse of the patriotic poem.
We should fear exciting the ire and jealousy of the neighbouring
colonies, by a longer quotation.
Amicus, (No. \.) ?Quite unintelligible.
Mary M.?Onv fair correspondent also favors us with an ? Ode
to Tasmania.? The opening lines indicate the island to be at
present in the same condition as Dr. Watts? celebrated sluggard?
? Awake, Tasmania, wake and see
The light that now illumines thee.?
We are led to infer that at about the 6th verse, Tasmania,
obedient to the call, has rubbed its eyes, yawned, risen, and
attired itself, for we are told??
? In this arrayed thy glory stands
Unrivalled in the eyes of man ;
And thou for beauty, and for worth,
The joy and praise of all the earth.?


Good news indeed!? The enigma composed in 1851, suggested
by a colonial event of that year, is too remote in interest for
our pages.
C. B. A. ?The verses forwarded exhibit good plain sense, and
hearty honest feeling, yet are by no means poetry. A poem does
not consist merely in a certain number of even-measured lines,
with a rhyme tacked on to each pair. It is, indeed, far easier to
define what poetry is not, than what it is. Each writer possesses
his own peculiar style, and this style is the impress of his mind,
his personality, his idiosyncrasy made manifest. Yet with this
infinite variety in thought, form, and expression, the band of poets
stands marked distinct and high above the herd of vainly aspiring
poetasters. The deficiencies in your verses are?first, a lack of
imaginative power, and freedom in conception; and second, a
strained formal diction. Read Shelley, Browning, and Tennyson,
and observe how musically their lines fall upon the ear.
Gemini. ?The sketch of Launceston in 1865 is, we fear, rather
too bright and hopeful. Suppose we had admitted it, and seven
years hence some worthy alderman were to take up our work, and
read the article, what a satire it might appear on the real state of
the town. No new wharves, no pier, no railway, no drawbridge,
no suspension bridge, no excursion trains, no tasteful gardens in
St. John Square, no public baths fronting said gardens, in brief,
?no nothing!? Certainly, the cry we so often hear raised,
? Advance Tasmania,? sounds well and cheering, but the pace of
the progress and improvements made, seems on a par with that of
the oft commended ? Tortoise? in the fable.
W. W. W. ?The sage Martin Tupper, in his ? Proverbial Phi-
losophy,? thus opens a chapter. ? All things being are in mys-
tery ;we expound mystery by mystery.? True enough, no doubt,
but, unfortunately for W. W. W.?s wondrous verses (we had
almost written �C werses,? such was the charm of alliteration), for


these we cannot find the proper mystical key. Can our readers
help us in the two first verses ?
PROSPERITY.
? In the vale flowing with happiness,
All shall be emblems of righteousness ;
Gifts that the heart are bound to fill,
And the world with general good-will.
Oh, flow on ye waters, and give security,
I'or ye shall be bound with purity ;
Studded with ships of merchandise,
Endeavouring with honesty to gain the prize.?
Captain Stoney has mistaken the form of our publication.
# ? An incident in Bush Life,? ? lire minister at the little
church,? ? Letters from Tasmania,? and ? Notes during a voyage,?
are declined with thanks. They are clever and graphic, but would
prove of greater interest to the author?s family and friends, than to
the general public.
? A sea-yarn,? ? Five minutes too late,? and ? What are your
intentions ?? are not quite suited to our pages.
Trojan has sent us some very boyish effusions. We would
advise him to apply the ? stolen moments,? which he now devotes
to ? making? poetry, to a better purpose?say, the study of John-
son?s Dictionary, where he will find the word ? literary? spelt
with one t.
Crispin?s poems are rather too long and heavy for the light links
of our Chatelaine.
Goldpen?s ? Essay on the social condition of Woman,? is de-
clined with thanks. It is a wide subject, and cannot be disposed
of in a few pages. Women themselves, with doubtless the best
knowledge on the subject, have written earnestly and boldly, and
are still, indeed, in various ways, discussing it. Legislators are


trying their hands at the knotty question. Our Poet Laureate,
has also dealt with it, in the glowing and fantastic poem, ? The
Princess.? He thus pictures the end and aim of woman?s career ?
? Till at the end, she set herself to man
Like perfect music, unto noble words;
And so these twain, upon the skirts of Time,
Sit side by side, full-summed in all their powers.?
? A native youth? sends us a batch of Tasmanian lyrics. We
suppose they are intended as parodies; take, for instance, the fol-
lowing, which is certainly no improvement on ? Loch-na-Garr? ?
?' Away ye gay climes, with your bowers of roses !
In you the wild, fickle, and heartless may rove ;
But give me the isle, where the wild-fern discloses
Its beauty in freedom, the land that I love.?
And here again our native youth has forgotten the distinction
between parody and plagiarism:
?My island home, land of the brave,
Pride of the Southern Sea ;
Like Naiad rising from the wave,
Most beautiful and free.
Though drear and lone the Tasman?s home
To such as soulless be ;
She woos my steps where?er I roam,
My island home for me.?
Casa Dodd ?F. M. ?Attempt?Amicus, No. 21?M. J, C.?
Helena ?G. L. ?Halcyon?J. F.?Nemo ?Tasman ?Mercury?
H.?R. H.?Cleon ?J. H. M. ?Candour?and Sphynx send us
? verses,? ? lines,? ? fragments,? ? poems,? and ? stanzas,? on
various subjects, and of various degrees of excellence, for which
we beg to offer our thanks and compliments.
Our contributors must not be disappointed at finding their com-
positions excluded from the Chatelaine, as the habits of thoughts
induced, and the exercise in writing, will still benefit them.


Many of these contributors, with a little more practice, will write
remarkably well; and should the Chatelaine ultimately assume the
character of an annual, we shall hope to hear from them again
next year.
P. C. deserves our thanks for the trouble he has evidently taken,
but his poem, in addition to its extreme length, is for other reasons
unsuited to our work.
The ? Fugitive Thoughts? of A. Miggs, might have been ac-
cepted, had they been a little less fugitive. Such tiny poems of
one and two verses only serve to whet the appetite, without satis-
fying it. Try your hand at a more solid substantial dish, a " piece
de resistance.?
Loftus?Veritas?and Euterpe have sent us some sound sensible
papers, but the topics they have selected are too vast to admit of
justice being done them in such small space,
The Tale of the Duroc has appeared in another form.
? A Fragment? is the title of a tale about a nice girl, who has
fallen in love with a nice young man (Mr. Edward Payson), and
who reveals the state of her affections with nice little palpitations
of the heart, to her nice kind mamma; so far all is very nice.
Mamma approves the match; but then, most inopportunely, Ellen,
the heroine, is taken ill, goes to the sea side, becomes worse, and
dies, leaving poor Edward quite disconsolate. This is the plot of
the tale; we wish we had room for a specimen of the style, which
is very quaint and queer.
L. B. ?Still another poem on Tasmania, of which, as in former
cases, our beloved readers shall have a specimen?
? Let Victoria boast of her regions of gold,
Her resources unknown, and her treasures untold ;
Let her proudly exhibit her unrivalled store,
Of ponderous nuggets and sparkling ore ;


But Nature?s best gifts on Tasmania are showered,
With a liberal hand she our island has dowered;
For climate, for scenery, for fruit and for flowers,
Oh where is the land that is richer than ours.?
The lines (forwarded by a gentleman whose name we cannot
decipher) written by a little girl of ten years of age, exhibit no
remarkable degree of talent. We have known many children write
equally well, yet there is always something unnatural and unplea-
sant in such early efforts. Don?t encourage it; if little Mary ask
for a pen, give her a ball; place a skipping-rope in her hand
instead of a sheet of paper, and depend upon it she will ultimately
become much more intellectually, ?healthy, wealthy and wise.?
That careful observer, and genial writer, Sir Bulwer Lytton, has
noticed this precocious and unhealthy developement of ideality, in
his delightful tale ?The Caxtons.?
A young lady, who signs herself Anon, A. Z., Ava, Eva, Ida,
and Y. Z., in a charmingly indifferent fashion, has sent us a
bundle of little poems, for not one of which, alas! can we find a
spare nook.
Delta.? Your sketch of the ?Showman,? is certainly very
clever, but smacks too much of the broad humour of ? Hood?s
Comic Annual,? to allow its appearance among the more staid and
sober articles composing our little work.
Jeane. ?Here we have another rechauffe of that favorite theme,
? Tasmania,? The opening lines dash off in brilliant style?
? Ho ! ?tis the youth of Tasmanian birth,
His eye flashes vigour, bravery, mirth ;
Strength sits on his limbs, and girdeth his frame,
Seems he not born for the favorite of Fame ??
Then we come to ? Ho! ?tis the horse of Tasmanian breed! E?er
was there seen a more excellent steed ? ? and so on, till we reach
? Ho! ?tis the blushing maid,? concerning whose charms the poet
goes into the wildest raptures ?


? Her half-parted lips, two cherries might be,
Her soft gentle voice sounds mu-si-cal-ly.?
We have been beguiled into these quotations from Jeane?s verses,
by the influence of a deep-seated affection, a tender weakness for
that little exclamation Ho! There is in this small word a martial
trumpet-like force, a condensed ? Up Guards and at ?em!? It
brings to mind the stately ballad of the Battle of Navarre, where
Macauly has put it to such good use, and also the Banquet at
Windsor, of the parody-loving Bon Gaultier?
? There drank the valiant Wellington, there sipped the cautious Peel;
And at the bottom of the board, Prince Albert carved the veal.?
? What, pantler, ho ! remove the cloth. Ho ! cellarer, the wine,
And bid the royal nurse bring in the hopes of Brunswick?s line 1
Then rose with one tumultuous shout, the band of British Peers,
God bless her sacred Majesty! Let?s seethe little dears !?
? How I put my foot in it,? is written by one who has plenty of
language, but lacks clearness and concentration. The result is,
that the tale is wearily spun out, and, indeed, seems to possess
no settled plot or interest.

LAY OP FATHERLAND.
IF, Carr Boyd.
O my fatherland, O thou far land,
Rushes swift memory home to thee;
Mellow and holy as dreams of the star-land.
Of the high star-land where Love hath its dwelling??
(Heart of mine, heart of mine, still thy wild swelling).
Dear-native land, are thy visions to me.
O my fatherland, sweet sunny motherland.
Wondrous thy scenes both of mountain and lea;
Bright tho? the glories of many another land.
Kindling the soul of the bard with devotion,
Yet they awake not the thrill of emotion,
Dear motherland, thou awakest in me.


O my fatherland, fairy-land, golden-land.
Memory revels in dreams of thee;
Me seemeth thy wood-lakes I view, dear olden land,
Where through thy hoar-trees the moon?s face is glim
mering,
Where on thy wavelets her long wake is shimmering.
Full of sweet glories thou art to me.
O my fatherland, youthhood?s mirthland.
Land of the merry heart, frolic and glee;
Land of proud loving souls, honour?s own birth-land.
Land of high daring, that wooeth all danger.
Land of true friendship, home of the stranger.
Evermore pineth my heart for thee.
O my fatherland, boyhood?s magic land,
Tremblingly yearneth my breast to thee;
Famine and Death-plague have made thee a tragic land,
Yet in thine anguish and woe thou are dearer.
Dearer still, loved one, and ever yet nearer,
Presseth thy heart-grasp on memory and me.
O my fatherland, childhood?s dream land.
Dreaming I rove by thy rivers and sea;
Purest of rivers are thine, O stream-land.
Noble thine ocean shores, worn by the surges ;
Nought they now echo save sorrow?s loud dirges.
Motherland, mourneth my soul for thee.
O my fatherland, fair-land, far-land,
Hear my sad wailing voice o?er the dark sea;
Take thou this wreathlet, this fast-fading garland,
Woven of Poesy?s humblest flowers,
Culled mid the heart-griefs? bleakest showers.
Fatherland, ?tis my poor tribute to thee.


VINETA.
From the German of W. Muller, ? Ans des Meeres trifern trifern
Grande .?
From the quiet Sea?s deep deep foundation,
Evening bells are chiming faint and slow;
Ah! they give us wondrous information.
Of that ancient town which lies below.
Sunk for ever, with its Art and Wonder,
Life and Beauty there have found a grave;
Yet the burnished pinnacles gleam under.
Throwing golden sparkles on the wave.
And the sailor, who once idly steering,
Saw that magic glimmer gild the tide;
Still returneth, caring not nor fearing,
Tho? the rocks may frown on every side.
From the quiet heart?s deep deep foundation,
Comes a chime as of bells faint and low;
Ah! they whisper wondrous information.
Of the love, which it no more may know.
There for ever sunken, sad and lonely.
All my world of hope and beauty lies ;
And bright gleamings from its ruins only,
On the mirror of my dreams arise.
Like that long-forgotten buried city,
In the deep, I too, would find a grave;
And sweet Angel-voices, full of pity.
Seem to call me from beneath the wave.

LEGEND OF THE CATARACT.
The ? Legend of the Cataract ? may not be philosophically or
geologically correct. It is the production of fancy; and the only
object I had in view in writing it, was to contribute something to
the ? Literary Chatelaine,? which might have the effect of inducing
many of our citizens, as well as the visitors to the Northern Capital,
to appreciate the beautifully picturesque, and grand, and majestic
scenery by which it is surrounded.
I might have elaborated the subject, but found it absolutely ne-
cessary to clip the wings of fancy very closely, in order to keep
within the limits of such a work as the ? Literary Chatelaine.?
The Author.
INTRODUCTION.
Launceston held holiday. Christmas had come to greet us.
Not as in the fatherland, heralded by sleet, and frost, and snows,
and the gloom of dismantled forests; but here nature had put on
her loveliest dress of many-shaded green to meet him, and shook
hands with him under the canopy of an unclouded summer?s sky.
Guns and fishing tackle were in great requisition that day; and
the watermen reaped a harvest of gain. Glad to escape for a short
season from the monotonous task of posting ponderous ledgers,
and tediously endless letter copying, I found myself in the after-
noon of the day sauntering up the Cataract Hill, on the west side
of the town, enjoying the extended and beautiful prospect presented
to my view from the elevated position I occupied. The town in
the valley below me, laid stretched out like a large map. Through
the vale beyond flowed the North Esk, like a huge serpent drag-
ging his sinuous trail along ; and in the distance, the lofty ranges


of Ben Lomond formed a noble back ground to tbe whole, lo
the north the Tamar might be seen, encircled by hills, having no
visible outlet, but giving one the idea of a fine inland lake. A
beautiful panorama, unknown to many of the visitors to our
Northern Capital; but once witnessed, what lover of the grand
and picturesque could fail to appreciate it.
I strolled along, lost in admiration of the enchanting scene
before me, when I suddenly came upon the edge of that stupen-
dous gorge, through which.the South Esk foams along in its roar-
ing, turbid course to the Tamar. How marked the contrast
between the two sceneries ! The one peaceful and picturesque, on
which the eye reposed with calm delight; the other magnificently
wild and grotesque, striking the soul with awe and wonder.
Wandering over the hill, and descending its steep and rugged
side, I entered a deep ravine. As though nature were desirous to
clothe her ruins with beauty?wild flowers of every hue, and blos-
soming shrubs grew in the crevices of huge boulders, and the wild
geranium and clematis crept up the sides of precipitous rocks, that
frowned majestically over me as I passed under them. A boat was
crossing the Basin; I hailed it, and went over to the other side of the
river. On up a gully, where the tall tree-fern spread its long fan-
like leaves, forming an impervious shield from the sun?s rays; over
and around rocky eminences; and then after sundown I found
myself reclining on a rock, looking down the ravine through
which the river was brawling, and seething, and tumbling.
Fatigued with my ramble, and lulled by the waterfall, I must
have yielded to the powerful dominion of the sleepy god, for
strange fancies took possession of my brain, and m imagination I
was speculating on the probable cause which had produced the
results displayed in the scene before me; when, I was suddenly
made aware of the presence of a second person. Looking round,
I saw standing by my side, a tall muscular man. His complexion
was black. He was drest in a cloak made of the skins of the


opossum and native cat. His hair was matted, and hung in thick
clots around his neck. In his hand he held a spear, and a waddy
was stuck through a girdle, made of the sinews of the kangaroo?s
tail, which encircled his waist. ? You seem to enjoy the scene be-
fore you,? said he, mildly. ? I do,? I replied, looking up to my
visitor with feelings akin to fear. ? You need not fear me, ? said
he; ?I suppose you think that this was always as it now appears
to your view.? ?On the contrary,? I replied, ? I was just at the
moment of your appearance wondering what great convulsion of
nature had produced such awfully magnificent results.? ? Would
you like to know ?? ? I should; and you speak as though you
were somewhat acquainted with its history.? ? I am,? said he,
mournfully; ? I remember too well its sad history. I was too
deeply interested in the direful catastrophe ever to forget it.?
? �u remember ?? said I, staring at him with surprised enquiry.
? I remember,? he briefly rejoined. ?By your appearance,? I
said, ? I should take you to be a descendant of the aborigines of
this island, and yet your speech and expression is vastly superior.?
? I am not a descendant, nor can I claim to be an ancestor of the
present degraded race,? said he. ? I was one of the first who
landed on this fair isle; and as to my speech, it is not for an in-
habitant of the body to dive into the mysterious teaching, whereby
one released from his load of earth acquires knowledge in a far
greater degree than falls to the lot of the most gifted of mortals.
But listen! I am about to disclose what has hitherto been hidden
from your race. A tale of love and friendship, sorrow and death.?
?Love and friendship?? said I, interrupting him, ?really the present
barbarous condition of the native tribes would not lead one to
expect that such feelings could have an existence within them.?
?There,? said he, ?you show your ignorance of human nature,
and consider not, how that the unbridled restraint of such fierce
passions as love, revenge, jealousy, and hatred, would soon break
up all social ties, and good government, leading to wars, and
treacherous bloodshedding; and, unaided by civilization, ultimately


degrade the man or the nation to the level of the brute creation.
But your time is precious, and therefore I will at once begin my
sad tale.? Casting his dark eye around him, and heaving a deep
sigh, he commenced.
Chapter I.
Many centuries have elapsed since we came across the sea from
the north. Some fishermen, driven out by the fury of adverse
winds, returned with the intelligence that they had sighted land,
far away to the south. Prompted by curiosity, and that desire for
roving which characterised our race, but more particularly by the
hostile attacks of powerful neighbouring tribes, which necessitated
us to retire before our conquerors; our tribe determined to make
acquaintance with this unknown country, and accordingly, pre-
parations for emigration were made on a grand scale. The stringy-
bark trees were stripped, and huge sheets of bark were formed into
canoes, capable of holding some twelve or fifteen persons, and
secured from capsizing by long outriggers of pine. These were
launched: and after waiting some weeks for a fair wind, and a calm
sea, we embarked. An equal number of the sexes occupied each
canoe; the men armed with strong paddles, and each vessel carrying
a sail, made of the skins of the opossum and kangaroo. Two days
of hard paddling and sailing brought us to land. I shall pass over
all the incidents connected with our landing, and all the inter-
vening circumstances which resulted in our settling down on this
lonely island. Suffice it to say, we loved our adopted country,
found plenty of game, and enjoyed an undisputed and unlimited
freedom in roving about from place to place. Years passed away
happily. But alas! dissensions arose. Think not, as I have told
you before, that our race presented at that period the same degraded,
savage, and brutish appearance as when the first white man landed
on these shores. We had then our government, patriarchal in its
nature, the oldest being considered the father of the tribe, to


whom all the rest paid due reverence. His will was law; his decision
final in all matters of dispute; and he was, in fact, the absolute
governor of the tribe. Our old chief was, almost in a literal sense,
the father of his tribe; most of those whom he governed being in
some way or other related to him : but the ravages of age had so
far impaired his intellect, that he issued the most tyrannical orders,
and though all due respect was paid to his position, and great al-
lowance made, and forbearance manifested to his infirmities, yet
he was a constant source of annoyance, dispute, and dissension
amongst the family he governed. Matters rose at length to such
a pitch, that I, who was next in seniority to the old chief, was
called upon by many of the people to take the reins of govern-
ment into my own hands. This request caused no little jealousy
amongst those more nearly related to him, and the upshot of all
was, in a word, that we agreed to form ourselves into a distinct
tribe, with myself as the patriarch or chief. We bade adieu to the
remainder, and shaped our course across the country, until we
arrived at the borders of a large river. Following this down, we
came to a large and beautiful lake, surrounded by hills and alive
with fish. This is the very spot; not as you now view it, degene-
rated into that shallow basin, but spreading its calm surface nearer
to the tops of those hills, whilst the spot on which we now stand
was many a fathom beneath its surface. This deep ravine?through
whose wild and unshapen sides you look, as through a vast
tunnel, upon the peaceful Tamar and the lower part of the town
picturesque and beautiful indeed, did not then exist?Ah me! that
it ever should ! The Wamarrady, or South Esk as you now call it,
did not foam and war through its caverned gorge then; but went
off in a more tranquil course down yonder to the right, past the
burial ground, and through the valley on which your town now
stands. (He turned away and covered his face with his hands in
deep mental agitation. It passed, and he resumed.) Well, I
called my tribe around me, pointed out the beauty and advantage
of the situation, and commenced at once to lay out our camp.


Some days went over; and whilst the men were employed in
hunting, the women had stripped the surrounding trees of
their bark, for the purpose of building their gunyahs (huts), and
making canoes to paddle across the lake. Thus our days were
past in fishing, hunting, and paddling our canoes across the water,
or diving down into its pellucid depths. No jarring sound of dis-
cord was heard amongst us. Nothing but peace and harmony
prevailed.
I had a daughter; ah ! I had a daughter. Beautiful she was,
dark though her skin, and the white man might have passed her
by as beneath his notice. But she was lovely in my eyes, graceful
in form, nimble as the kangaroo, with the eye of the hawk, and
the innocence of the wood-pigeon. She was the idol of her father
and her tribe. Many of the young men aspired to gain her af-
fections, but one only was fortunate enough to revel in their lavish
and fervent outpourings. Poor Wammerroo! I loved him too.
Bold and fearless was he of the eagle eye, yet tender and affectionate
withal. I loved him, and was happy in knowing that Yanna loved
him too. I think I see them now, as hand in hand, or with their
arms entwined around each other, they wandered forth to the brow
of yonder hill, and gazed upon the lovely prospect before them;
or, with her seated in the canoe, which he shot across the lake with
a few strokes of his nervous arm, they drank in large and deep
draughts of love from each other?s eyes. Alas! alas! all gone!
all gone!
We had not been here many months, when a deputation from
the other tribe came to visit us in a friendly manner. We heard
by them that the old chief was dead ; that the son, as being next
in age, and possessing a robust and commanding exterior, had
taken his place, and that the tribe was desirous that we should
meet in a friendly corroborree at a place equally distant from each
of our encampments. Two persons formed the deputation. Of
one I shall say nothing, as he appeared to be merely the other?s
shadow. The other was the grand-son of the former, and son of


the present chief. I noticed that he had a restless, cunning look in his
dark eye, and was peculiarly taciturn and haughty in his bearing.
We received them with all the marked attention they deserved, as
ambassadors from the parent tribe. I issued orders for a grand
corroborree in the evening. The hunters went out with waddy
and spear, and the fishers watched to transfix the fish as they in-
cautiously rose to the surface of the lake. In the afternoon an
abundance of kangaroo, opossums, snakes, and fish were brought
to the camp. The women had collected huge piles of wood for the
night-fire, and soon all were busily engaged in preparations for the
feast. The deputation sat with me, in front of my humble gunyah,
around a large fire; and the rest ranged in a circle around us, each
family having its distinct fire. A low and plaintive melody was
chanted by the women, which gradually rose into a wild and stirring
chorus; then the dance was commenced by the men round the
huge fire in the centre, and continued until bathed in perspiration
they sank on the ground with fatigue. Then the same low, plain-
tive sound was heard, rising as before, and accompanied by the
beating of time on stretched kangaroo skins with a short stick;
and so it went on, Yallarrama, the old chief?s grand-son, was
highly pleased ; and to do him honor, I commanded Yanna to
fetch some of the choice morsels of the feast, and present them to
the two visitors with her own hand. She advanced timidly and
did my bidding. But such was the look Yallarrama gave her that
my heart sank within me, and she looked at me disconcertedly
and appealingly. ?Thatwill do, daughter,? I said, ?resume your
place.? ?Will she not sing,? asked Yallarrama. ? She will,? I
briefly replied. I gave her a look ; she returned to her former
position, and presently was heard the soft and sweet murmur of a
native melody, to which she had improvised the following words :
Our fathers all lived on the far off shore,
But they built the canoe, and she brought us o?er;


They feared not the winds, nor the stormy wave.
For their skill it was great, and their hearts were brave.
Chorus ?For the winds might blow, and the storms might rise,
But courage and skill all their power defies.
The country, we liked it, for it was new.
No hunter had startled the fleet kangaroo;
The opossum was tame, and the wallaby stood.
And gazed at their foes in a wandering mood.
Chorus ?But our hunters soon brought them down to the ground.
And the spoils of their valor were strewed all around.
But our father is gone, and our eyes grow dim.
For the tears flow fast when we think of him ;
For we loved him, albeit that old age came
And quenched in their orbits those eyes of flame.
Chorus ?Plaintive and low let his dirge be sung.
For we all loved our father, both old and young.
See! our brethren have come! behold them there !
A message of friendship and love they bear;
To greet our old friends, they invite us to go.
And unite in a feast on the Warranambo.
Chorus ?We accept it with pleasure; to-morrow will go
And corroborree hold on the Warranambo.
The honor they?ve done us, let us now return.
Pile, pile on the wood, and make the fires burn;
Sing, sisters, sing; and our brethren advance.
And join in a ring in the kangaroo dance.
Chorus ?Rise, brethren, rise, and the circle complete,
And beat time to our song with the stamp of your feet.
Inspired by the song, so full of native sweetness and melody,
the men rose to their feet, and the dancing and singing was kept
up till the moon had sunk down behind the western hills.


Gradually fatigue overcame them, and one by one they wrapped
themselves up in their cloaks of opossum skins, and stretched
themselves to sleep before their separate fires. Silence once more
reigned, broken only by the hooting of the mopekawk, the leap of
the kangaroo, as the dry branches cracked underneath his feet,
the solitary squeal of the opossum, the croaking of frogs in the
rushes on the borders of the lake, or the gambols of the fish sport-
ing on its surface.
Chapter 11.
The sun had risen over the top of the hill in front of us, when
one by one the denizens of our camp arose; a hasty meal was
made from the remains of the previous evening?s feast, and then
we addressed ourselves to our journey. The day had worn away
when we arrived on the banks of the ? Warranambo,? now named
by you the ? Mersey.? There we found extensive preparations for
our fete. Heartfelt and sincere were our mutual congratulations, and
the evening was passed away much in the same manner as the one
previous. I was, however, low and dispirited; some forebodings
of impending danger had taken possession of my breast. I noticed
that Yallarrama had paid the most marked attention to my
daughter, and that her lover was proportionately jealous and un-
comfortable. I wrapped myself up in my cloak, and laid down to
rest; but found sleep was not to be courted, and after many
ineffectual efforts to obtain repose, I arose and walked off in the
direction of a neighbouring thicket. I was not unnoticed. In a
short time I was joined by Wammerroo, who expressed his appre-
hensions of the proceeding of his rival, and had already disclosed
his fears to his affianced one. She also dreaded the approaches
of a man whom in her heart she disliked, and had strongly urged
on him to represent to me the necessity of a return to our home,
as speedily as possible, consistently with our present relations to
our hosts. I promised that we would, if possible, return on the


morrow, and both of us returned to our respective resting places.
On the following morning, I was accosted by Yallarrama in a
haughty manner, demanding my daughter in marriage. He
stated that the union would be beneficial to both tribes, inasmuch
as our interests would then be the same; expatiating on the
greatness and power of his tribe, and the direful consequences that
would arise from anything like dissension existing between us,
consequences which might threaten the very existence of our tribe.
Cunningly and cleverly did he pourtray the horrors of civil war,
concluding by a haughty demand for my Yanna, as the only means
of guarding against so terrible a calamity. I answered him mildly,
making him acquainted with the position sustained by the woman
whose hand he sought, and ended by asking him in an injured
tone, why he so much encouraged the idea of misunderstanding or
enmity existing between the two tribes. He turned away from
me in great anger, and in a threatening manner walked towards
the camp. I followed, and found him seated beside his father.
The old chief rose as I approached. ? And, so you spurn an
alliance with the powerful tribe oftheTarmaroo.? ? I spurn it not,?
I replied, ? I have given my reasons.? ? Bad reasons are they,?
rejoined he; ?thinkest thou not that the grandson of the renowned
Tarmaroo is better than yon man, who has but the heart of a
woman, and therefore delights only in their company.? ? I listen
not with pleasuse,? said I, ?to these remarks: he is the man of
Yanna?s choice, and she is the woman of his choice; I wish it not
to be otherwise.? ?If he is a man,? replied the old chief con-
temptuously, let him try his strength with Yallarrama, and let the
victor have the prize.? ? I boast not,? said I, ? but cannot do
other than accept the challenge.? Wammerroo had heard all that
had passed. Stepping up to me, he cried out, ?I am ready.? A
clear space was formed for the combatants in the centre of the
camp. They advanced slowly, each armed with a waddy. Well
matched were they in muscular power. Yallarrama rushed suddenly
on his foe with feelings of rage, hatred and disappointment, and


Wammerroo awaited his attack, animated by a feeling of hatred also
to his rival, and sustained by the love he bore to her in whose cause
he fought. Dreadful were the blows given and received, until one
from the powerful arm of Yallarrama laid prostrate on the ground
the youth I loved. A yell of triumph arose from his friends,
and a scream of anguish from the women on our side. Yanna
rushed to his side, and was about to raise him in her arms, when
\ allarrama caught her up, exclaiming, ? Thou art my prize.?
? Not yet,? shouted his antagonist, who had been but partially
stunned by the blow; ?Not yet.? Starting to his feet, and
maddened at the sight of his loved one struggling in the arms of
his foe, the whole powers of his soul and body seemed to be
concentrated in his nervous arm, as he dealt a well-aimed blow on
his head, and felled him to the earth. Insensible and bleeding he
was borne to the banks of the river, whilst Wammerroo bore off
his destined bride in triumph. ?The battle is won,? shouted I,
? I have saved my daughter.? ?It is won?? said the old chief
frowning, ? but from henceforth we cease to be friends; return to
your camp, we may some day meet again.? ?And should we
meet,? answered I haughtily, ?we shall show ourselves men.?
The old chiefs brow contracted, his dark eyes flashed with anger,
and his whole frame trembled with excitement. I saw that it
would be no longer safe to stay, so giving the signal to our party,
we turned our backs upon our former friends, and commenced our
journey homewards. Wammerroo was so faint and prostrated by
the severe blow he had received, that two of our men had to carry
him the greater part of the way; relieved as they grew weary of
their burden by other volunteers; for he was loved by all the
members of his tribe. My daughter walked beside him the whole
of the way; occasionally, when he stopped to rest, bathing his
wound, and displaying the tenderest and most affectionate anxiety
on his account. We reached our camp late in the evening, and
betook ourselves to rest. Wearied in mind and body by the
troubles and march of the day, we all slept soundly. I was awoke


in the dead of night by a piercing shriek, issuing from the quarters
of the women. Well did I know that voice; it was my daughter?s.
I sprang up, and found the whole camp in consternation. The
women were running about distracted. I ordered silence, and
listening, distinctly heard the cracking of a stick on the brow of the
hill there to our left; I snatched my spear and waddy, commanding
six of our most powerful men to accompany me, and commenced the
pursuit. Wammerroo was at my side; yet, weak as he was, he,
in the ardour of his spirit, soon outstripped us in our progress
across the rocky summit of the hill. We scattered so as to be
within call of each other, and held our course along the brow of
the hill for some time, when a low whoop was passed along from
the outermost man in the line; and soon we were gathered around
Wammerroo, who, holding his finger up in token of silence, was
gazing and listening intently to some sound that had caught his
ear in a westerly direction. ? The knaves have tried to put us on
the wrong track. They have not gone that way,? said he, pointing
in the direction we had been taking, they are down here, ?let us
go on quietly, and we shall surprise them before long.? He led the
way. We followed, stealthily and noiselessly as the native cat in
pursuit of her prey. Scrubs, rocks, and mountains formed no
obstacle to his ardent anxiety to overtake the wretches, and to
rescue from their hands all that he loved in life. He stopped on
arriving at the borders of a small running stream. ? Let us look
here for tracks,? said he, calmly. We distributed ourselves up
and down the stream, bending eagerly down to discover the
slightest trace of a footstep. Not long were we kept in suspense.
The signal was passed along, and we found ourselves again col-
lected around Wammerroo, who was carefully examining some
footmarks in the mud on the margin of the stream. ? Four have
passed here,? said he, in a whisper; ? and see, here is the print of
a woman?s foot.? We crossed over to the other side; there the
tracks were numerous, leading off at right angles with the creek,
and taking a direction almost due south up a high hill. Cautiously


we continued our course, and on gaining the top of the rise,
discovered a dim light in the valley below us. ? There they are,
said Wammerroo; listen! ? We did so, and distinguished the low
murmur of voices, and what struck to our inmost souls, the
groaning and weeping of a woman. ? Grasp well your spears,?
said I, in a low voice, ?and fail not to use them.? Hymen
answered by an expressive look. Slowly and quietly we descended
the rocky and almost precipitous sides of the hill, and entered a
thicket, distant about thirty yards from their halting place, and
under cover of which we could distinctly see and hear all that was
passing. There stood the fiend Yallarrama, with three men; and
there on the ground, almost naked, lay my weeping daughter.
I restrained myself and Wammerroo from rushing on them at
once, as I was anxious to know their intentions. Yallarrama
stepped up to Yanna??And so you thought you were won yes-
terday by your woman-faced man,? said he tauntingly. ? I was,?
answered she,? looking up proudly, ?and you were forced to acknow-
ledge it when his powerful arm made you lick the dust.? ? Ha! ha!?
said he, laughing, ?I am not so easily beaten; you must know,
young woman, that you will this night be the wife of Yallarrama,
the son of the chief of the powerful tribe of the Tarmaroo.?
?Be not too sure,? answered she; ? the depths of the stream will be a
certain refuge from such disgrace.? ? Talk not of disgrace,? said he
haughtily, ? nor think that such charms as yours will not call for
extra watchfulness on my part; depend upon it, no other refuge than
my arms can be allowed you. Come, arise, and let us continue our
journey.? She moved not, ?If you are tired,? continued he, ?there
is nothing will give me greater pleasure than to carry you in my
arms.? He approached, and was about to enfold her in his hated
embrace, when Wammerroo sprang forward with a yell of fury;
hurling his waddy, he struck the arm that was ready to defile her
with its loathed touch, and broke it. Our men, at the same
moment, had thrown their spears with such precision, that the
remainder were lying transfixed and dying on the ground. Yallar-


Rama, seeing all lost, by a succession of almost superhuman
bounds, gained the top of the hill beyond. I rushed to the side
of my daughter; but she had fainted from fatigue and fright.
Wammerroo took her up in his arms, and when she had recovered,
stooped lovingly down and kissed the pretty pouting lips, wiped
the tears from her eyes, and whispered in her ear, ? I have won
you once more.? ?You have,? replied she, with emphasis;
?Nobly have you won me, and you shall have the prize.? We
rose and hastened back to our camp, which we entered just as the
first streaks of morning appeared in the eastern sky.
Chapter 111.
It became absolutely necessary now for us to prepare for the
worst. I well knew the character of our opponents, and the fact
of blood being shed by us, was an insuperable bar to reconciliation.
We therefore agreed to remove our camp across the river, under
that rocky hill yonder to our right, so as to put the river between us
and our foes, in case of an assault. The young lovers pleaded hard
to be united after so many hairbreadth escapes from eternal separa-
tion. I could not deny them; and according to the ceremonies of
the tribe, they were joined together as man and wife, as soon as we
had occupied our new position. Our canoes were all moored by
the women?s gunyahs, on the borders of the lake, so that in the
event of an attack, they might seize them, and paddle out beyond
the reach of danger. Not many weeks had elapsed when some of
our scouts, whom I had daily sent out to watch the movements of
the enemy, came in with the intelligence that fifty men had entered
our territory, well armed, and besmeared with the war-paint. I*
called out our men, and numbered forty strong, able and active
warriors. I considered it advisable to go and meet the foe, rather


than to allow him to approach our camp. All were agreed on this
point: and leaving the women in the camp, with injunctions to
keep strict watch, and to take to the canoes in case of surprisal,
we started on our first warlike expedition. Marching all day, we
encamped about a mile distant from our adversaries, intending to
commence the action on the morrow. The enemy must have had
some intimation of our proximity to them, for they appeared soon
after daylight in the valley in which we were encamped. The war-
whoop was sounded, and returned hy our party, and taking shelter
behind the tall stringy bark and gum trees that stood there in
great numbers, each side awaited the onset. I need not enter into
all the particulars of the battle, so widely different from those your
race engages in. Ours consisted in a series of ambushments and
skirmishes, whilst our only defence was the cover of the trees, and
a constant and guarded watchfulness. Occasionally, some man
would step out from behind his cover, as if in defiance ; but he
had need of an eagle eye, and a bold heart. Spears and waddies
from all directions would fall around him in a perfect hail. Such
examples of daring had their beneficial results, however, inasmuch
as they gave some clue to the places where the opposite party lay
concealed. It is not to be wondered at, then, that a fight like
ours should last all the day, with no great loss on either side. There
were seasons, however, when, infuriated by rage, or startled at the
nearness of the foe, the opposing parties rushed out, and grappled
one another in deadly conflict. The result then depended mainly
on mere physical strength. The spear was thrown aside, the waddy
plied with desperate energy, and sharp flints inflicted deep gashes
on the naked bodies of the wrestling combatants, whilst yells of
anguish, rage and triumph, made the very hills and woods ring
again. In such desperate charges as these, as may be anticipated,
the loss would be proportionately greater. Our loss amounted to
only two men killed, and five wounded. That of the enemy, to
six killed, and eight wounded. We both retired at the approach
of night; they to their home, and we to ours; each party carrying


iff its own dead and wounded. Several such encounters took
dace, during the short space of a few weeks; and, I say it boast-
fully, our party had the ascendancy in every engagement. We at
length agreed to desist from hostilities for the present; not that
the rancour and enmity existing between us was in the least sub-
dued ; hut, because both sides were weary of contending longer.
I come now to the sad conclusion of my story. Many moons had
waxed and waned since our last battle, and the summer?s sun had
risen many times. One day only, I shall speak about Alas!
the day that robbed me of all that I had in life worth living for.
That day was suffocatingly hot. The air seemed changed into a
yellow mist, through which the sun appeared shorn of his coronet
of rays. The birds ceased to sing, and panted for breath amongst
the thickest foliage of the forest, or dropped dead on the ground,
overpowered by the excessive heat. The very fish rose not to the
lukewarm surface of the lake, but lay reposing in its cool calm
depths. The kangaroo and wallaby left not their cover till dark-
ness had overspread the earth. Human nature, so constituted as
to be capable of enduring the greatest extremes of heat and cold,
sank prostrate and exhausted. Night came; but, although par-
tially relieved by the absence of the sun, the same close and suffo-
cating sensation prevailed. Dark clouds rose in the west, black
as the embers of the extinguished fire. They gathered and hung
over our camp, so low in position, that an awfully portentous
feeling took possession of the soul. The wind, now and then,
rushed down the valley in such strong gusts, as threatened the
overturning of our bark gunyahs, and then all was awfully still
and silent as death. We all lay gasping for breath, and almost
expiring with langour, when we were startled by the same piercing
shriek as heard on a former occasion. Again all was commotion.
Deep and low growling thunder issued from the black cloud
overhead, and flashes of forked lightning followed each other in
quick succession. One of them disclosed three canoes paddling


away from the bank, in one of which I distinctly saw the form of ray
daughter, held down by the dastardly Y allarrama. He and some others
had taken advantage of the storm to swim across the lake, unmoor
the canoes, and again snatch from my arms my darling treasure.
There was no time to lose. Wammerroo and three stout warriors
seized a canoe, and armed with spears and waddies, dashed out
into the middle of the lake in pursuit. The darkness was so in-
tense that neither our enemies nor ourselves were conscious of the
direction we were taking, until a blinding flash revealed to us our
foes, evidently bewildered, paddling back towards us. All again
was darkness. ?Wait,? said Wammerroo, as he raised his spear
in readiness for the next flash. It came, and showed him his
mortal foe within twenty yards of him, standing upright in his
canoe, with his back towards him. With all his might he
launched his spear. The missile flew, but the result was unknown
for darkness again obscured every object: but the ear caught,
amidst the deafening noise of the thunder, and the roaring of the
freed winds, a dying yell of anguish, and a heavy splash. Although
the flashes followed each other more rapidly than I had ever ex-
perienced before, yet it seemed an age until the next one came;
and when it did, we saw a canoe upset, and a female form close
under the bows of Wammerroo?s canoe. It was Yanna. He drew
her in affrighted and exhausted. The black cloud lowered over us.
Deep silence succeeded, and seing that all was safe, I managed to
grope my way back to.land. All our women had taken to their
canoes, and most of the men had joined in the pursuit. A faint
flash showed me the whole of them returning across the lake.
Suddenly its surface became strangely agitated. Huge whirlpools
and enormous billows disfigured its hitherto calm face, and a
hollow, murmuring sound was heard underneath the ground. All
at once, a stunning and deafening thunder crash burst almost in
our very ears, accompanied by a flash of lightning which lit up the
whole horizon with the brilliancy of day. The black cloud was
apparently cleft asunder. The ground on which I stood heaved


id fell like the ocean billow. A noise like the violent collision of
two rocky mountains was heard, followed by a roaring sound as of
a large body of water rushing through a rocky ravine. The lake
receded from my feet; and just then a faint flash of light shewed
me the canoes borne on the receding waters, as with a roar equal
to the loudest thunder, it swept foaming down yon awful gorge.
One shriek I heard above the -tumult of the elements. That
shriek still lingers in my ear; and when I visit this spot, it is the
signal calling our spirits to meet. Nature?s throe was past; the
black cloud had rolled away to the east; the moon shone forth in
all its purity and serenity, but I saw nothing hut the white foaming
torrent; heard nothing but that shriek drowned in its awful roar-
ings, and then sank down insensible on the earth. How long I re-
mained so I know not; it must have been some hours, for when I
came to myself, I saw the miserable remnant of my tribe standing
around me. I thought for a moment that I had been sleeping,
and that the events of the preceding night were the effects of some
disturbing and awful dream. I was soon painfully convinced of
its^reality: for on looking round, I saw that the bed of the river
had been altered. The ground had risen away there to the
right, and impeded its further progress in that direction. I found
that the hill on which my camp stood, and the mountain
before us, had been cleft in twain. Our noble lake had degenerated
into that small and insignificant basin, and its waters, one hundred
feet lower than before, had drained away through that rocky chasm.
We wandered with saddened hearts along the edge of that pre-
cipitous gorge, and near its termination found the bodies of
Wammerroo, and his and my Yanna. They had become entangled
amongst the rocks, and there they laid, a loving, yet heart-breaking
spectacle, clasped in each other?s arms. We dug their graves there
amongst the rocks, and interred them, A huge block of rock,
shaped something like a pillar lay close by, which, by our united
strength we raised, and placed as a mark to indicate their last
resting place. That rock, after the lapse of many centuries, still


stands; but who, excepting yourself, knows anything of its sai
history. I gathered together the few relics of my once nohlf
and loved tribe, and shaped my course with them beyond those
mountains in the east, on the shores of the great ocean. Oui
women had all been swept away in that convulsion of nature.
One by one the men died away, until I alone was left, the repre-
sentative of a once powerful and peaceful tribe. Weary of life,
and infirm with age, I dragged myself back to the spot where
those I loved reposed; and lying down by the stone pillar that
marked their grave, a cold shivering seized my limbs, my senses
left me, and?l woke to consciousness no more in the land of the
living. But my spirit still lingers spell-bound around the awful
spot, and revels in the deafening noise of the torrent with a strangely
morbid feeling. Hark! do you not hear the signal-shriek and the
roar. lam coming, Yanna; my daughter, lam coming!?
My ghostly visitor disappeared, and I awoke to the shrill sound of
the night wind, and the roar of the South Esk foaming down the
Cataract gorge.


TO MY INFANT SON, ON HIS FIRST
BIRTH-DAY.
A year has passed since thou, my son.
My first-born, breathed the vital air ;
A year with all its changes gone.
Its sunken hope, its-joy, its care.
Twelve months have rolled on silently.
And as the swell on ocean?s breast,
Moves on the vessel stealthily.
When stormy winds are hush?d to rest.
So time has led us on life?s way,
And left the past a dream gone by ;
A picture varied, sad and gay,
Pourtrayed by memory with a sigh.
Since then, thou oft hath cheer?d the hearts
Of thy fond parents with thy smiles;
And kindled love with infant arts,
Their fondness winning by thy wiles.
We?ve watch?d thy little growing form.
Like swelling blossom on the tree;
And noted many an opening charm,
That parents? eyes are swift to see.
"Then pleasant thoughts of future grew.
When fancy traced thy life?s career;
And with a hopeful pencil drew,
Success, to which we came not near.


Thus does kind Providence repay,
The blighted purpose, ruin?d hope;
Since in our children still we may.
The door of other visions ope.
We live in them?on them we rest.
To win the triumphs once we lost;
As when the sun sets in the west.
He still may in the moon?s light boast.
SUMMER SABBATH MOENING.
? Thou shall call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord and
honourable.?
Sun of the Sabbath! o?er the misty mountain
Rising sublime, again I bid thee hail!
To welcome thee each sparkling rill and fountain.
Hastes to the vale.
Then will they meet thee in those cool recesses.
Where flow?ry turf beneath the shade is spread.
And the fresh breeze the early wanderer blesses,
While over head?
The woodland minstrels their sweet chimes are ringing,
(Sweetest this day methinks of all the s,even,)
While from his grassy nest the lark upspringing,
Soars high to heaven.


Children of sorrow! greet this day?s returning,
A moment look away from your distress,
And to God?s holy temple humbly turning.
Seek there for peace.
Oh! ye that toil! your six day?s work is ended.
Rejoice! rejoice! the day of rest has come!
And quiet love, and joy, together blended,
Meet you at home.
Mothers, this blessed day of home communion,
Will on your children?s minds for ever tell ?
A holy bond of intellectual union.
A fireside spell.
As life advances, care perchance may sever
Those who now cling around the parent tree;
But peaceful, happy Sabbath homes can never
Forgotten be.
Britons rejoice! that still we, as a nation,
Claim for ourselves and God one day in seven,;
Oh! be it spent in careful preparation.
To dwell in heaven!
Sabbaths of Earth! who counts the priceless treasures,
By this one boon poured out upon mankind;
Sweet are its duties?holy are its pleasures?
Pure and refin?d!
Sabbaths in Heaven ! some seraph tongue must teach us
The boundless triumphs of the world on high;
And we must, ?ere those revelations reach us.
Have learned to die.

NOTES OF A TRIP TO GEORGE
TOWN IN 188 8.
Vates.
? That sacred seer whose comprehensive view,
? The past, the present, and the future knew.?
Pope?s Homes.
Tuesday, March 6th , 1888 ?I am at last at George Town, which
1 began to imagine I should never see again. How often have I
in the midst of business, sighed for the sea breezes and clear skies
of this lovely spot, endeared to me by so many fond recollections
But how changed in every respect is the present George Town
from that of thirty years ago! For instance, when I last left the
pier, then a patched up structure of wood, it was to embark on
board a tiny vessel called the Gazelle, which, however, was the
only steamer plying in those days between Launceston and the
various settlements situated along the banks of the Tamar: the
passengers by which might congratulate themselves, if they accom-
plished the journey in less than seven hours. Now, the handsome
rapid Titan conveyed us the whole forty miles in three hours
(including stoppages), and landed us at a magnificent structure,
wooden indeed, but resplendent with white and gold, and brilliant
coloring. From the wharf itself, alongside of which the steamer was
moored, we ascended a broad flight of steps to the covered pier, a
long and lofty room, lighted with windows on each side, and ter-
minated towards the shore by a verandah, beyond which were
assembled cabs and other vehicles, for the accommodation of new
arrivals. I however, having but scanty luggage, disdained these
appliances of ease, and shouldering my portmanteau, strode, like an
independent Briton, up the ascent to the township, stopping at


very instant to admire some new improvement in the scene before
ne. Instead of the wooden building, which, in my younger days,
food on the left hand of the road from the pier, at the very entrance
if the township?of which building not a vestage now remains?
he traveller of these days is invited to enter a spacious stuccoed
lotel, which stands conveniently for the use of those visitors who
)ring their yachts with them to George Town, the number of
diom must be considerable, if one may judge by the variety of
ileasure boats visible in all .parts of the bay. Those who, like
nyself, intend to make a long stay in the place, generally penetrate
her, and resort to'one of the two rival boarding houses, one
fronting the sea, at the further corner of the square, and the other
situated at the upper part of the township, and, consequently,
removed a good way from the water. I ought not to omit, while
speaking of the bay, the new colony which has lately sprung up
on the bank opposite to George Town, and which seems flourishing
enough, if one may judge by the frequency with which a ferry boat
is plying from one side to the other, about a stone?s throw from
the pier. I trudged slowly along that side of the square nearest
the sea, formerly uninhabited, save by a few cows and goats, the
poverty of whose condition betrayed the scantiness of their pas-
ture : now occupied by detached residences of various sizes, each
standing in its own garden, until I reached the gate of the Marine
Boarding House, to which I had been recommended. I had no
reason to find fault with the recommendation. The spot on which
it stands used to be a favorite with me even in early times, and I
had often remarked upon its peculiar capabilities for being made both
a picturesque and commodious residence. I am extremely glad to
find, that its original beauties have not been interferred with ; but
only, as it were, retouched, and set in a more favorable light. As
I sit writing by my window, which faces the sea, I see the western
snn still shining on that wonderful assemblage of underwood,
among which, in former days, it was so delightful to ramble : it
still extends itself through the gardens of this splendid mansion


(for so I must call it, although it is but a boarding house): all thi cc
man has done, is, to make good the innumerable pathways whic s *
intersect the scrub in all directions, and, in one instance, to develo
the resources of a little stream, that, in my younger days, used t
expend its waters idly in saturating all the ground in its neigh v
bourhood ; now it has been confined within bounds, and directei c
to leap in a mimic cataract over an artificial dam into a smal 1
basin below, from which it pursues its quiet way into the sea. M; '
room possesses also a second window, from which I command i
view of the. street leading to the pier. Along it I see pacing
slowly my companions of to-day?s voyage from Launceston, wh(
are also my fellow lodgers at the Marine Boarding House. Yes
there they are, both of them, and there is she, my dark-eyed
sweet-voiced acquaintance from Hobart Town, in whom, old fogy as
I am, I could not help taking a deep interest. Her story was as
plain to me, as though she had told it word for word, instead oi
pretending to mislead me, as she did with such engaging perverse'
ness. If she does not wish all the world to know her secret, she
will leave behind her, the next time she starts on her travels, that
extraordinary bird, who is, unintentionally, the most barefaced
tale-bearer I ever met with. Poor thing! I dare say, though, she
would not for worlds part with that bird; ?with his incessant cry
of ? Richard,? and her pale face, a man must be a very dolt who
cannot construct a story. Ido not wonder at her pale looks, her
. languid deportment?change of air and scene, forsooth, and
doctor?s orders?if I am not egregiously mistaken, love is the
cause of her sickness, and love alone can cure it. But then again
?how can a bald-pated senior, like me, turned sixty-three,
imagine the existence of such a thing as love ? I wonder I can
even spell the word! The boarding house bell rings for tea, far
more fitting object for my old meditations than love, cockatoos,
or young ladies, however pale and dark-haired, and interesting
looking. Ido wonder, however, if she will he at the table: if so,
I must manage to get near her, some how, sufficiently near to


intinue our acquaintance, so auspiciously begun on board the
earner this afternoon.
Wednesday, March 7th.? This morning?s post brought me news
which agitated me not a little ?I almost regret, that the old system
of posts twice a week between George Town and Launceston is
no longer in existence ?I should have had a day or two of quiet,
at any rate. My friend Smith, of Melbourne, writes to tell me,
he has seen my nephew Richard, from whom I parted five years
ago, under circumstances the recollection of which, even now,
gives me unspeakable pain. I thought I had forgotten both him
and all things connected with him, as fully as he forgot me ?for
that there was forgetfulness on his part is amply shewn, by his
having never written me a line, or sent me a message respecting
his abode or occupation, since the night when we parted, after
our difference. In spite of his faults, his deception, his want of
consideration, he was a fine lad : there was the making of a really
manly character in him, but his one fault of selfishness marred all.
He fancied he had a right to command the services of all connected
with him, and, so long as others cared for his interests, he would
sit with his hands folded, condescending to let them minister to
his necessities and caprices. Then he ran into debt, and into
trouble: and when I was willing to have helped him, he did not
make out a fair statement of what he owed : I discovered the
mistake in his account, and remonstrated with him?was I too
harsh, too hard upon him, poor lad ? I used the word lie to him,
and his proud spirit could not endure it, and we parted in anger.
Oh ! it is hard to forget one, whom I loved as my own child, for
the sake of that dear sister who is gone. Smith writes, that
? Richard seems Well, and in easy circumstances, but restless, and
sometimes gloomy, as though some secret grief oppressed him.?
Poor fellow! can I, dare I to hope, that his proud spirit is subdued,
and that he is contrite and repentant for his faults ? There
is that bird again, going through his words and sentences; his


mistress must be near, for there he is beginning, as usual, ? Oh! dt\
come and scratch poor Polly??and then, as the desired operatic�
proceeds, ?there?s a darling.? The creature, evidently, considered
himself as much at home in George Town as elsewhere. Now he
begins with his cry of ? Richard? let me see?there, she fondlei
the bird, and he actually seems to understand that he pleases hei
best by repeating this name: so again and again he says it; anc
again and again she caresses him for the sake of ?whom ? Curious,
that, on this day, of all days, I should hear of two Richards!
Come, this sort of idling will never do: what between Melbourne
letters and lack-a-dasical cockatoos, my few days? leisure at George
Town is likely to be frittered away finely. I will resolutely shut my
writing-case, and go for a solitary walk among the improvements
of George Town.
Same day, 10 o?clock An old fellow like me, who has
gone on year after year, losing the friends of my youth, and
replacing them by no new ones, may well be astonished, when, in
remote corners of the earth, he stumbles upon one of the few
people who still retain regard and affection for him. It has been
my fate to meet this afternoon with one of these, and the sight of
him affected me much. I met him in the pretty garden that sur-
rounds the church, a most elegant structure, recently erected in
place of the tumble-down, misproportioned edifice of my early
reminiscences : the garden now slopes down to the water?s edge,
and is very tastefully laid out with flower beds, shrubberies, and
gravel walks, forming, altogether, one of the prettiest features in
this pretty landscape. We talked of old times, and it was strange
to notice how the line of his recollections coincided with my own
thoughts of the morning : for he commenced, of his own accord,
upon the subject of my nephew. He had encountered him, he
said, shortly after his dispute with myself, in the interior of the
island, where he seemed to be leading a very careless and jovial
life of it with a young bachelor friend of his, whose solitary cell


situated in the same grounds with the mansion belonging to
ae rest of the family. My friend had met him at the large house,
r here there seemed to be, by his account, some sort of under-
tanding between Richard and one of the young ladies, and he
ished to know if anything had come of it, I avowed my total
rnorance of his movements, after he had quitted my house in
Launceston, and then our conversation went on to other matters.
I cannot help noticing these details, because to-day, everything
animate, or inanimate, seems to recall poor Richard to my
thoughts : as though, after the receipt of this morning?s letter, I
needed any further reminder to bid me reflect on that painful
subject.
Thursday, March Bth. ?After our water excursion to-day, my
friend dined with me at the table d?hote of our boarding house,
where he had hardly taken his seat, before he recognised an
acquaintance in the young lady who owned the wonderful cockatoo.
The plot thickens : for, so far as recollection served him, this was
the same young lady, whose partiality for my nephew, as well as
his for her, had been so perceptible, during my friend?s visit at
Park, five years ago. But she told me she came from
Hobart Town; and my friend knew of no such bird as the remark-
able one which now attends her, and which I pointed out to his
admiration, as it sat on a railing in the garden of our house, and
implored us to come and scratch poor Polly.
Friday, March 9th. ?This morning was devoted to an ex-
ploring expedition, in company with my friend Jones. He is well
acquainted with George Town, and has remarked with great
interest its changes for the better, which have been proceeding,
with tolerable rapidity, for the last fifteen years. I commenced
the day by joining him at breakfast, in the rival boarding house to
the one I am staying at, which, being situated at the upper part
of the town, commands a more extensive view than ours can boast.


Jones is an old traveller, and willingly purchases exemption from
the high winds which beset our residence on the sea shore, with
the loss of the sumptuous accommodation, and close neighbour-
hood to the bathing houses, which I and my fellow lodgers enjoy.
In passing from one house to the other, I traversed one side of
Regent Square, which, in my younger days, as now, formed the
centre of the township; but in those days it was a wilderness of
prickly herbage, sacred to goats and geese, with a solitary sun-dial
breaking its monotonous level. Now it is the scene of merriment
and recreation from morning till night. The ground has been
railed in, and laid down with grass in various places, to serve for
cricket grounds; there are also arbours, and rustic seats in the
midst of shrubberies and flower gardens. In other parts may
be seen leaping-bars, swings, and other appliances for gymnastic
exercises; finally, the centre of the square is occupied with a spa-
cious rotunda, of iron and glass, containing a swimming bath,
which is supplied with water from the sea, pumped up through
pipes, and regularly emptied out and replenished every day. My
friend first conducted me to the grounds behind the township,
which in my time were entirely uncultivated; now, the labours of
energetic settlers have transformed them into productive market
gardens. In particular, he pointed out one plot to me, sloping
down to the fresh water creek, from whence, in the early summer,
an almost fabulous supply of strawberries was produced. I was
somewhat disappointed to find the commercial part of the township
so little altered, in comparison with the improvements visible else-
where. However, progress has begun even here, and a few good
shops have risen, or are rising, along those well-remembered streets,
where, thirty years ago, nothing was to be seen but lines of paltry,
insignificant stores, of iron or wood, in which the worst goods were
offered at the highest prices?things nasty, without the recommen-
dation of being also cheap. After inspecting the gardens and
the streets, we extended our walk in the direction of the Heads,
admiring, as we went along, the commodious villas, each sur-


rounded by its own garden, which flank both sides of the broad,
well-paved road leading to the lighthouse. In these rambles we
spent several hours, being never weary of instituting comparisons
between the present and the past, which, in this case, were certainly
by no means odious. At length, as evening drew on, we retraced
our steps to the township, and saw, as we approached, the signal
from the flagstaff, betokening the arrival of a steamer from Mel-
bourne. The daily visits of vessels from the various Australian ports
form epochs in the life of that community of idlers, which constitutes
the summer population of George Town; and accordingly a crowd
is never wanting on the pier to hail the arrival of a new batch of
visitors. We, however, were too late to join the usual assemblage
on this occasion; and as I went home with my friend, and did not
reach my own lodgings until a late hour, I shall have to wait till
to-morrow morning to ascertain what additions to our circle have
been made in my absence.
Saturday, March 10th.?' To-day has been an eventful one, such
as I never expected to have spent at George Town. Let me try to
recall each link in the chain of events, if my confused brain will
serve for the record with sufficient clearness. I had quite forgotten
the steamer from Melbourne, and was surprised to find a large
company assembled at our breakfast table this morning. Seeing
my young friend at the upper end of it, and a chair beside her
vacant, I seated myself there, and we were soon deep in conver-
sation. While so employed, we heard from the verandah the well-
known voice, calling, as usual, ? Richard! ? ? Richard ! and a
moment after, another voice, so familiar as to make me start, ex-
claimed, ?My name, by Jove! ? Then footsteps came crunching
along the gravel walk up to the verandah, and a moment after a
young man entered the room, carrying the talkative bird upon his
arm, who had made friends with him in that short time, and was
now entreating him to scratch poor Polly, in its usual persuasive
tones. ? Why,? addressing himself to a gentleman seated opposite


to me, a stranger like the speaker, ? this creature knows my name.
How ever did it learn it ? Whom does it belong to ?? I turned to
my next neighbour with a smile; but, if I intended to say anything,
I never said it; for she was deathly pale, trembled in every limb,
and seemed ready to faint. She conquered her emotion, however,
by a strong effort, as Mrs, M., the lady of the house, pointed her
out as the owner of the bird, thereby drawing the stranger?s
attention to her. It was now his turn to start, and look pale; and
I could not help sharing his perturbation; for in the sun-burnt,
manly form before me, with his enormous beard and moustache,
I recognized my long-lost nephew, beyond the possibility of
mistake. He, however, seemed hardly to see me, so entirely was
his attention fixed upon my neighbour; he muttered something
inarticulately, and stumbled to a vacant seat just opposite to us,
still keeping the bird upon his arm. No sooner was he seated,
than the creature left its perch, and hopping across the table to its
mistress, saluted her by name, in its usual fashion, fluttering and
bowing with every mark of grotesque delight. This incident
seemed to increase his disorder to the utmost; and his fair neigh-
bour was similarly affected; and, evidently unable to control her
feelings, she caught up the bird hastily, and retreated from the
room through one of the windows. The rest of the company, who
had been surprised for a moment at her abrupt departure, soon re-
sumed their former occupations; but Richard followed her with his
eyes, seeming more than half inclined to leave the table in pursuit
of her. As I watched his movements with great curiosity, his eyes
happened to meet mine. I was sure he recognised me, by the
peculiar start he gave; but the recognition, for the present, had
the sole effect of stimulating him to fresh struggles, in order to
regain his composure, in which he so far succeeded, as to be able
to address an observation to his friend, excusing his awkwardness
on entering the room, by the surprise he felt on hearing the bird
pronounce his own name. But he was evidently much disturbed,
and took the earliest opportunity of quitting the room. As for


me, I was nearly as disturbed as he was; only one idea presented
itself distinctly to my mind ?the necessity of seeing him again, and
in private. Yet how to accomplish this, I knew not, for he
evidently refused to acknowledge me; and my pride said, that it
was not for me to take the initiative in seeking this interview.
While I was pondering these things, too restless to remain in my
own room, I strayed into the garden, and wandered idly among
the tea-tree scrub. Chance led me to the little sequestered basin,
near the bottom of the garden; when, on approaching it, I per-
ceived the very man I was in search of, alone, and stretched at full
length on the grass beside the stream. I was so close to him
before he saw me, that it would have been impossible for him
to avoid me, even had he been minded to do so. A sudden
resolution entered my mind : I went up to him, and, placing my
hand on his shoulder, called him by his name. He looked in my
face defiantly for one moment, and then, his better feelings pre-
vailing, he seized my hand with both of his, and sobbing out
?Oh ! Uncle,? fairly kissed it. I need not record the conversation
which followed, every word of which is impressed on my memory.
He told me of all his adventures since our parting; of the weeks
and months he had spent in loneliness and want; how, frequently,
after a day spent in fruitless toil, his broken spirit would recall, in
the silence of the night, visions of that home he had quitted so
recklessly; visiops, which presented themselves so vividly to his
imagination, as to fill him with anguish and remorse. At length,
fortune had smiled upon his toils, and at the moment he spoke to
me, he was in possession of a good station in Victoria, and in the
receipt of something like five hundred a-year ?? but,? said he, ? I
could not rest until I had found you out, and sought your forgiveness
for my extravagance and insolence; besides I wished to repay you
some portion, at least, of the debt I owe you. My heart failed me,
however, before I reached Launceston; and I turned aside to George
Town, until I could summon up courage to meet you And
you, dear uncle, are not the only friend I have met here un-


expectedly.? ? I thought not,? said I. ? You need not tell nae
who she is, for I know that already: but how stand matters be-
tween you?? He blushed, as he replied that, on the occasion
when my friend met him at Park, he found, after a time,
that he had over stayed his welcome, so far as his male entertainers
were concerned. This he had felt severely, but yet he could not
tear himself away; for, indeed, what prospect of a livelihood had
he in the world beyond ? And besides, he had found such an at-
traction to the place in the person of the fair Emily, as made him
bear the sour looks and illnatured inuendoes of her kinsfolk with
tolerable resignation. ?At last,? he said, ? the old man came to
an open quarrel with me; said he wanted no paupers hankering
after his daughter; that he was sick of hearing the name of
Richard pronounced so often in his house. In fact, he showed me
the door, and looked so sharply after me, while I was preparing
for my departure, that I had no opportunity of exchanging a part-
ing word with Emily. I hung about the neighbourhood for a
couple of days, in the hope of seeing her; but on the second day
she was sent from home, and means were taken to set me on the
wrong scent; so that, after a fruitless search through the whole
neighbourhood, I was as last obliged to abandon the pursuit of
her.? ?I do not think she has forgotten you, though,? I said.
? Not my name, at any rate,? said he, smiling. "I am a friend
of hers, ? said I; ? shall I introduce you to one another ?? He
answered that he thought that was scarcely necessary; ?indeed,? he
added, with some hesitation, ? I have seen her myself this morning.?
? And what did she tell you ? ? ? She had not many moments
for conversation,? he replied, ?for she was on the point of starting
on an expedition to Mount George, or somewhere; but she had
time to explain to me that, since her father?s death, two years ago,
the whole establishment at Park was broken up, and she
had been consigned to the care of an aunt, who resided in Hobart
Town. She hinted, also, that the circumstances of the family were
not so prosperous as they had been; and that the reason of her


relative retiring to Hobart Town, was, in order to live cheaply;
since, now that the seat of government had been removed to
Launceston, expenses were much less there than in any other town
in the island.? ? I think, ? said I, " I may promise you another
interview with her before her day?s expedition is over. I have
some acquaintance with the giver of the picnic, and if you will not
mind accompanying me through the bush for a few miles, I fancy
we shall not be considered -intruders, if we join the party under
Mount George.?
We went. The day was deliciously fine?a true George Town
autumn day?and two of the party seemed to enjoy it, if no one
else did. Indeed, I ought to answer for four, in a certain measure;
for myself, in seeing the happiness of the young couple, and re-
flecting on the unexpected good fortune which has befallen me on
my visit to this place; and for the cockatoo, which, I am certain,
is too sensible a bird not to share its minstrel?s delight.
We three ?we four I mean ?for the bird is too important a per-
sonage to be neglected in the account ?returned to Launceston on
Monday. I am impatient to put a termination to the business
which has so unexpectedly arisen in the course of my holiday
trip, and I know, in so doing, I am acting in accordance with the
wishes of all parties concerned. Ido not think Emily wants any
more George Town air to make her quite well and bonnie again;
nor do I expect to find much difficulty in accomplishing my under-
taking. The father?s death, and the reduced circumstances -of
the family, will, I imagine, be found to have removed obstacles,
which some time ago might have proved formidable. Richard
himself has enough, and if he had not, he has a tolerably rich
uncle, who will not let money, or rather the want of it, stand in
the way of his nephew?s happiness.
I always loved George Town, my happiest days have been spent
there; and my present visit has been no exception to the general
rule. I have found an old friend, recovered a lost kinsman, and
gained a new kinswoman, all within a week. So lam resolved,
should I ever be down on my luck, to fly to George Town for
refuge, as I know something is certain to turn up in my favor.


LIGHT AND SHADE.
From the Italian of Caravita.
Through midnight gloom Bianca strayed.
Her ebon locks around her played;
So dark they waved, so black they curled.
Another night o?ersnread the world !
The moon arose ?Bianca?s face.
Resplendent shone with every grace;
It gleamed so fair?it beamed so bright,
Another moon illumed the night!

THE EARLY DEAD.
How does the cheated heart recall.
The feelings of the past;
Despite the chilling clouds that fall.
The early flower to blast.
The flower that blossoms and lives on.
Throughout its destined time,
Is not so missed, when it has gone ;
It has outlived its prime.
But when we see the bud we nurs?d,
E?re it has reached its bloom;
Its beauty gone, its charms dispersed.
By some untimely doom.
Long shall we mourn its early death.
When lighter griefs decay;
And we have seen the spoiler?s breath.
Sweep later flowers away.


FIRST IMPRESSIONS:
A TASMANIAN SKETCH.
S. Front Hill.
Poor Emily S ! The calm influence of her gentle spirit,
as it spread its young pinions and took its flight into a still
brighter scene, mingles yet with the strong emotions awakened in
the mind whenever memory travels back to the loveliness of that
morning, in which the splendour of Tasmanian scenery, bathed in
the cloudless glory of a Tasmanian sky, burst upon us. The
insidious bloom which then mantled on her cheek was but a
mockery, a delusion, and a snare?it was hut the blush of that
relentless disease which had fastened itself upon her young heart.
Why had it not consummated its secret and fatal designs amidst the
screams of that tempest which, for several days previous, had been
holding the destiny of our frail barque in doubt and suspense ?
Was there no sympathy between the two ? Was not the wild
uproar of elemental strife congenial to the triumph of death over
youth, beauty, and love ? Is there no kindred feeling between the
dark spirits who ride upon the wings of the storm, and the fell
tyrant who spreads a mildew over the freshness of health, and
points its young victim onward with an unmoving finger to the
cheerless portals of eternity? Had not the unchained winds
power over the weak and fragile being whose immortal mind was,
even then, fluttering on the extremest verge of the world ? Could
not that regal blast, as it swept onwards in desolation, disentangle
the relaxing grasp which her spiritual essence so feebly retained
upon its earthly tenement ? It would seem not. There was no
sympathy between the calm sunshine of her young mind, and the
wild tumult of the elements. She waited for a more tranquil


hour, and?it came. jThe hour that was to have brought back to
her faded cheek the glow that had departed; that was to have
given vigor and elasticity to her enervated form; that was to have
lighted up the eye, and to have sent the warm blood careering
joyously through her young veins; that hour?the hour of hope?s
fruition ?the hour which had been sighed for and prayed for ?came.
Our ship was lazily drifting past a huge pile of whitish grey rocks,
upon which the genius of barrenness and sterility sat enthroned.
Tasman?s Island looked cold and desolate as it heaved its deformed
proportions out of the ocean. A few feeble rays of early morning
came struggling across the sombre breast of the lazy swell of the
sea, and the harsh cry of the gull might he heard, now and then,
as it rose from its eyry amidst the crags, and sailed away into the
wide waste of waters. There was something chilling and repul-
sive in the scene around us ?and yet, perhaps, it was congenial to
our minds at the moment. Was there no doting father, at that
same instant, on board, tenderly bending over the wasted form of
his child, and speaking to her of a hope he felt not ? ? Are you
better this morning, Emily? We are in Storm Bay, darling, and
we shall be on shore to-night! Are you not better ??
There was something in the sluggish calm that was imposing;
whilst the baldness of the shore ?its utter cheerlessness?and the
absence of anything approximating to fertility, imparted a melan-
choly character to all around us. We might have thrown a biscuit
upon the rocks of Tasman?s Island, by the side of which we were
then floating. The dull and mournful wash of the sea, as it tamely
laved the slippery base of the'slimy rocks, over which green and
mossy kali had been clinging for ages; and the wild cry of the
myriads of sea birds, which now began to quit the nests they had
built amid the guano-whitened masses of stone; the flapping of
our sails, the creaking of the yards, and the indolent motion of
the ship, all tended to depress the spirits. At that early hour
there seemed to be a sympathy between the lazy ocean and the
grim crags which reared their cold grey forms, like petrified


sentinels, from out its bosom. Yet, all this blank and unmean-
/
ing ugliness guarded as lovely a spot as there can be found in
nature. How lovely?yet a prison !
Another hour?and what a change! The sun was just shaking
himself free from the horizon; scarcely a breath of air was to be
felt. The sea was heaving its undulating and glassy surface in
the earliest beams of the morning, like some huge giant rousing
himself from a troubled sleep. Stretching far away, hills upon
hills, varied with every hue ?every line of beauty?riveted the
attention. The Raoul, sterile, grey, and cold, flung its long arm
into the Bay, as if to shield the proud magnificence jt enclosed.
Who that has once beheld that splendid and gorgeous scenery can
ever obliterate it from his memory ? Bays and promontories, of
every form, met the eye whichever way it turned. Mountains and
hills of the most fantastic and picturesque shapes?their summits
crowned with the rich warm foliage of the cedar and the pine?
started into a living reality ; whilst the monarch of all. Mount
Wellington, with its snowy diadem sparkling and glittering like
diamonds in the warm beams of the morning sun, shot far away
up above and beyond the fleecy clouds that were reposing undis-
turbed upon its breast?the guardian spirit of the scene.
I was leaning over the bulwarks, in the waist of the ship, lost
in thought, and in admiration of the scenery, when Mr. ,
the mate, placed himself noiselessly by my side. The quarter deck
was generally deserted, save by the man at the helm, lest any noise
should disturb Miss Emily. When the men spoke to each other,
it was in an audible whisper. This was the only mode in which
these warm hearted sailors could evidence the tenderness of their
feelings towards ? the poor young lass.?
? How is your passenger this morning, Mr. ? I hope
she is better.?
?I believe not!? was the whispered reply. ? Nor do I expect it,?
he added mournfully. ? Ah! sir, when you see a ship?s anchor
hove short, her topsails mastheaded, and the blue peter at the fore,


you may log it that she?s bound on a voyage. Miss Emily had the
blue peter flying yesterday?l saw it plainly enough, and, depend
upon it, she?ll break ground before long!?
? Have you seen her father this morning ??
? He?s sitting in her berth, and has been all through the night.
This storm that?s coming on will lay him on his beam ends, poor
gentleman! That?s Hell?s Gate, Sir; it?s not often you have such
weather as this in the Bay.?
? Indeed!?
? I remember one morning, Sir, ?twas on board the Franklin,
and in the very heart of winter, when we were, as near as possible,
in the spot we now are. The sky was overcast with leaden colored
clouds, and every now and then there would be a spit of rain. There
was not much of a breeze at daylight, although quite enough, and it
cut one like a knife. It was cold, piercing cold: a sort of morn-
ing to make one growl if the galley-fire wouldn?t burn. We were
just opposite the opening here on our starboard bow, when a
nor?-wester came out of Port Arthur. I shall never forget it. You
don?t catch such a breeze every day. Our gear?like everything
else belonging to the Government?was, fortunately for us, none of
the best. Both our topsails went to leeward with the roar and the
smoke of a cannon, and that saved us. There was no sea on at
the time, there rarely is with the wind from that quarter, but the
ocean looked as if it was steaming. Its quite different when the
breeze comes in from the south?ard. You can?t hear yourself
speak then for the music. As I was saying, when the squall struck
us, the sea came hissing over the ship like hot rain. To get a peep to
windward was impossible, it would have blinded us. Far away to
leeward, we could just catch the faint outline of Bruni above the
smoke. The whole bay was just for all the world like a washer-
woman?s tub ?all soap-suds. The sea gulls were whirled aloft in
the eddies, as the blasts tore furiously round the Pillar, as though
they were so many bits of paper. We could do nothing. All hands
were huddled together under the windward bulwarks, whilst the


gale was fairly screaming over our heads. It was more like the
scream of a steam-engine?s blow-pipe than anything else I know of.
I tried to speak at the top of my voice to the man alongside of
me, but it was of no use. To hear my own voice was impossible.
Yes! The Bay looks quiet and loving enough this morning?it?s
turned out on the right side?but, as I said before, Sir, don?t
persuade yourself that it is always like this!?
Although the sun was travelling upwards in uninterrupted
glory, lighting up, here and there, the sharp angles of the frowning
cliffs?spotting the cold grey masses of granite with a warm touch
of yellow, and enlivening the frigid blackness with jagged and un-
even patches of rich dark brown, still this was insufficient to remove
the impression of solitude and inhospitality which had fastened itself
upon the mind. An apology for verdure ?a stunted furze ?
crowned the lofty summit of �ape Pillar, whilst a scarcely greener
vegetation capped the Raoul.
As the morning advanced, a light cats-paw would, now and
then, creep stealthily into the Bay from the east, streaking the
shining surface of the water with blue, and breaking the long
reflections that seemed to travel downwards into the sea, towards
another sunny and congenial sky beneath. The swell of the
Pacific was still felt in the Bay, and its hollow surge could be
heard thundering amidst the reverberating caverns, as the waves
rolled heavily and lazily along the shore. Now and'then an albatross
would rise slowly from the transparent bosom of the sea, playfully
flapping it with its wings, and leaving a silvery stream of light in
its trail. There were several vessels becalmed in the numerous bays
in the distance, their white canvas glittering in the sun, and flinging
their reflections downwards, uninterrupted, to where we lay.
Towards one o?clock the sea breeze fairly set in. The horizon
to windward assumed a deeper hue, and the outline of Bruni stood
distinctly confessed against the sky. As we left the Raoul behind
us, the whole aspect of the scenery began to change. The bald
coast was superseded by bays of exquisite loveliness; the brown


stinted scrub, by the lofty pine and cedar; the perpendicular rocks,
by the shelving shore, which swept downwards, in every line of
beauty, into the sea. The magnificent scenery of nature, in all its
tangled profusion, was around us on every side. Nor were the
signs of civilization wanting. Here and there patches of ground
had been reclaimed and cultivated. Small white cottages stood in
bold relief against the rich dark-green masses of foliage; and
unambitious gardens, neatly fenced, and in full vegetation, ran
downwards to the beach. After a tedious voyage there was some-
thing really beautiful in the fluttering of some linen hung out in
the sun to dry. Nor could any theatrical representation have
afforded one tithe of the exquisite delight we experienced in witness-
ing the gambols of the children at play upon the shore.
We were now abreast of Betsy?s Island?Big Betsy, as it is
sometimes insultingly called. On a clump of rocks of the south
point of this beautiful island?and at the mouth of the River Der-
went, stands that most eccentric and whimsical offspring of an
equally eccentric and whimsical imagination the Iron Pot.
Contemptible, as it appears to be, with its two or three lowly
dwellings by its side, many are the blessings which its unpretend-
ing and unassuming light has evoked. How many a trembling
heart, tossed about in the roaring billows of Storm Bay, on nights
so pitilessly dark that nothing could be seen save by the light of
the hissing phosphorus as it tore madly along the side of his frail
barque?how many a trembling heart, on such a night as that, has
been gladdened by a glimpse of that solitary light, shining like a
beacon of hope amidst the blackness of the darkness that en-
veloped him!
Emily S had been brought in her father?s arms, upon
deck. A bed had been prepared for her by her own desire. Each
hastened to express a hope that she was better; but, it was
expressed in a tone so subdued and faltering, as to make it
manifest how small was the hope they felt. There was a brilliant
light in her eye, and there was a flush upon her cheek; but the


light was not the joyous light of health, nor was the spot upon
her cheek the rosy representative of youth. She would smile at
the delight experienced by those around her, as they would direct
her attention to the charms of the scenery; and her faltering and
difficult reply?? Oh! yes, ?it is very beautiful!? still rings in
my ears.
Towards four o?clock the light sea-breeze had died away. Nearly
the whole breadth of the Derwent was now visible; and a noble
sheet of water is was! The north-eastern banks of the river?re-
vealing line after line of beauty? were bathed in a flood of glory,
as they lay in the full warm blaze of the declining sun. The
eastern side of Mount Nelson was in shade, cool and refreshing;
and the eye rested upon it with gratitude, for the relief it afforded.
Along the base of the mountain the mimic ripples of the almost
unruffled sea gambolled playfully amongst the few rich dark brown
rocks that, here and there, cropped up their heads. The beach
was narrow, but beautifully white; and appropriately set off with
patches of brownish green kelp, or sea-weed, marking the highest
encroachments of the tide. Immediately above, the land was in a
state of homely cultivation; and was adorned with a cottage of a
very unpretending but picturesque character, flanked and garnished
with outhouses and sheds. The trunk of an old tree ?barkless,
branchless, and whitened by age ?was still standing, a hoary rem-
nant of the magnificent forest that once stood there. Behind, the
mountain began to ascend; and masses of foliage succeeded each
other in profuse luxuriance, as Mount Nelson towered upwards
and away towards the sky.
Our barque was now drifting along, abreast of Sandy Bay. The
? upper portion of Mount Nelson was still bathed in the splendid
blaze of the declining sun. The water in the bay was entirely
sheltered from the influence of the light air, and the whole of that
magnificent scenery was reflected downwards in the transparent
mirror that reclined, in unbroken repose, along the margin of the
shore. Nearly the whole of the land lying upon the bank had


been reclaimed. Here might be seen, reflected in the water, th(
unpretending cottage, with its garden of vegetables and fruit trees th
and, by its side, the lordly and ambitious mansion, with its proud si
pillars, and its aspiring turrets, peeping through the rich bosses ol s<
foliage that lined, on either side, its gravelly carriage drives, and t(
surrounded and enclosed its arrogant lawn. Hundreds of buildings 1
of every shape, and composed of every material?the wooden, and t
the rough slab hut, and the neat brick cottage ?with their culti- [
vated gardens attached, dotted the landscape in every direction.
Here and there a solitary and unpretending building might be
seen, some distance up the mountain, struggling for a victory over
the unreclaimed majesty of the forest, which lay, mighty in its j
native strength, around and above it, and which seemed to smile
with scornful contempt at the pigmy efforts of man to invade its
lordly domain. Such was Sandy Bay.
Another hour had passed away; and the sun was sinking behind
the haughty summit of Mount Wellington. The absence of its
beams was a positive relief. The light air had died out, and our
barque was floating on a sea of glass. The anchor was hanging
over our bows, ready, at a moment, to be cast free from the cat-
head ; when the mate, who had been forward, took me suddenly
by the arm, and pointed aft. He spoke not; but to me his mean-
ing was clear and intelligible. With hands clasped, in an agony
of despair and grief, Mr. S was bending over the form of
his fair daughter. The picture presented by the dying?or dead ??
child; the wild pathos of the parent?s grief; the captain, pilot, and
men, standing round uncovered, and the sorrow depicted on every
countenance, presented a group to my contemplation I shall never
forget. The terrible grief of Lear, over the dead body of Cordelia,
recurred to the mind with a fearful emphasis, as the father tried to
persuade himself that life had not departed;?
? I know when one is dead and when one lives ;
She?s dead as earth. Lend me a looking-glass :
If that her breath will mist or stain the stone
Why, then she lives.?


Yes! amidst the rattling of the yards, and the rush of the cable
rough the hawse holes; at the moment the semaphore on the
summit of Mount Nelson was glittering in the last ray of the
setting sun; and the ship had completed that voyage which was
to have brought back the bloom of health to the cheek, and to
have given renewed life and vitality to the form?at that moment,
the gentle spirit of this fair girl winged its way into eternity!
There can be no doubt that, under ordinary circumstances even,
first impressions are not only the most accurate, but, also, the most
enduring. There are times when the mind is unprepared to yield
itself to the pleasurable emotions derivable from the contempla-
tion of the majesty and magnificence of nature. To deny this
would be unphilosophical. Nevertheless, first impressions become
in some degree deadened by a familiarity with the objects that
produced them. I have frequently contemplated the scenery of
the Derwent since; and, although it has forcibly recalled to my
niind the exquisite emotions it produced at the time; I have been
sensible, notwithstanding, that it failed to awaken the same keen
enjoyment. Some of its loveliest spots, too, have become identified
with associations of the most painful character?such as that of
the amiable Emily S ; ?associations with which many a
cherished idol, since relentlessly swept away, is indissolubly
cemented. We still acknowledge and confess that those scenes
are lovely. Who can deny it ? Although there is a melancholy
tenderness in the emotions they produce, to which the mind, at
first, was a stranger.
Even the grandeur of the scenery from the lofty summit of
Mount Wellington has been tinged with many a melancholy as-
sociation; although such emotions of regret for those who were
companions of our journey, but who are now for ever lost to us, are
n �t altogether antagonistic to the feelings of wonder, of sublimity,


and of awe, which that scenery inspires. The mighty ocean stretch-
ing far, far away into undefinable distance ?glittering and shining
in the rays of the sun?the lovely bays and promontories trembling
through the pale blue atmosphere; the vessels reduced to a mere
speck; the city dwindled into miniature; the broad tops of the lordly
trees,beneath the shelter of whose foliage the eagle-hawk has built his
eyry ; and the clouds rolling along beneath our feet. Who could
obliterate the memory of such a scene ? Or, who that has strained
his gaze to penetrate into the dark mysteries that lie hidden in the
inscrutable depths of the fearful clefts and chasms of that kingly
mountain; or, after detaching some huge mass of granite, has
listened with breathless silence, as it has bounded deeper and deeper
into the awful gulf, crushing all that opposed its downward and
fearful impetuosity, to catch, if possible, some faint echo of its
ultimate destination; who has not felt himself oppressed, at such a
moment, with feelings akin to terror ? The faint and almost in-
audible rush of unseen waters, as they pursued their secret course,
has been the only response. We turn away with a cold shudder
from the contemplation of the mysteries which cannot be revealed,
and oppressed with a sense of the stupendous and terrible majesty
of nature!
These scenes remain unchanged, hut not so the mind upon
which they operate. There they lie, in all their gorgeous magni-
ficence, as capable of imparting to others now the same emotions
as their first impression produced in me. Years have passed away
since then; yet, the memory of those feelings remains fresh and
green, although the feelings themselves can never again be recalled.
There can he nothing more vivid than first impressions. Whether
those impressions are invariably just, I leave philosophers to
decide.


TO CHLOE.
I care not for a handsome face,
Nor for a perfect figure?s grace;
O give to me the meaning eye.
And lips that speak sweet gentleness.
And movements marked with modesty;
This is to me true loveliness.
And if within the heart there dwell.
Love, like a pearl within its shell;
A calming pleasure then is felt.
That cheers the soul like summer bright;
In which the sun?s soft rays all melt.
In one wide outspread ocean fight.
So when I see sweet Chloe?s form,
Her presence sheds around a charm;
She charms the eye, she charms the mind,
Like gem enclosed in beauteous case ;
Of goodly heart and form combined,
Her beauty suits her inward grace.
She came, she saw, she conquered me.
Her flag she raised triumphantly
O?er ground that ?erst was free, it flies
O?er him who lawless once did rove ;
Beneath her gladdening rule there rise
The pleasant arts of joy and love.


And may that flag for ever fly.
And may the glances of her eye
Dispel the lowering clouds of gloom.
That o?er this changeful world?s cold skies
So constant flit, and nip the bloom
That former sunshine bade to rise.
So shall she find her liege?s soul.
True, loyal, steadfast to her rule ;
No foreign wiles, nor foreign power,
Shall ever o?er her right prevail:
Till at the last and parting hour.
Death shall between them draw his veil.
THE BANSHEE.
An Irish Superstition.
A bright-eyed boy on a couch was lying.
Silently, sadly we sat around;
Louder the winter winds were sighing.
Damping the heart with their hollow sound;
And night in her mid career was flying.
Enveloping earth in gloom profound.


Whiter the young cheek grew and whiter,
Louder and louder the winter winds blew;
But the heavy cloud on our souls grew lighter.
Which had shrouded us long in its sable hue;
For his gem-like eye now sparkled brighter.
And its beam lit up our quench?d hopes anew.
At length a wild shriek pealed nigh our dwelling.
Drearily thundered the winter blast;
And rushing forth through the tempest swelling,
We saw the dread Banshee gliding past;
A mortal?s death were her wild shrieks knelling,
For the bright-eyed young heir had breathed his last.
AN EXCURSION IN TASMANIA.
As but few persons are aware of the existence of that extraordi-
nary natural phenomenon called ?Tasman?s Arch;? and as still
fewer have ever visited it, I will endeavour, in the following pages,
to give' a description of an excursion made to it by a party in the
year 185-, It is scarcely necessary to say that the names mentioned
are fictitious.
The little church clock had just struck seven, when we stood,
a merry party, on the stone jetty that projects into the blue waters
of the bay, on which the convict settlement of Port Arthur is
situated. It was a lovely morning, in the beginning of November,
that sweet month in which spring and summer meet; we had risen


unusually early; discussed at our several tables a substantia
breakfast, and met here to join in the proposed excursion of th
day, an expedition to Tasman?s Arch.
We were a motley group, and though consisting of only seven
persons, it would have been difficult to find one of more hetero-
geneous materials, or more opposite characters. First, there was
our gentlemanly host, Mr. R., the civil commandant of the settle-
ment ; his tall military-looking figure contrasted strongly with his
remarkably quiet manner, and low, measured voice: he had kindly
placed boats, men, and etcetras, at our service for the day, and his
presence being then necessary at one of the government stations
on our route, he had consented to snatch a few hours? holiday for
himself, and to be our guide ?to the Arch.? In juxtaposition to
him was Lieutenant Laughton, who, with a company of soldiers,
was then stationed at Port Arthur; he rejoiced in the high-sound-
ing title of ? military commandant,? wore an aristocratic moustache,
and extremely light kid gloves, and was in every respect the
? cavalier par excellence? of the party. Report said, his handsome
face and agreeable manners had gained him so high a share of
admiration with the softer sex in Hobart Town, that the gallant
islander was in a fair way to be completely spoilt by adulation
and flattery, when an unlucky freak became the cause of his tem-
porary banishment from the social circles of the capital, to this
remote corner of the world. Be this as it may, it was very clear
that neither his spirits nor his good breeding had deserted him,
and he now came forward with true Chesterfield grace to hand the
ladies into the boat that was awaiting them.
Mrs. Linwood was a lady of doubtful age, but still prepossessing
appearance, whose bright hazel eyes and coral lips, released from
the embarrassments of an odious widow?s cap, were again free to
do a legitimate amount of mischief among unsuspecting hearts.
Under her chaperonage and protection, though for what earthly


reason no one could imagine, was Miss Hamilton, one of the
reigning belles of the day; a tall, handsome girl, with fine dark
eyes, raven hair, and a complexion that was the envy of her female
friends. She trod the little jetty with a queen-like air, as if the
very waters were subservient to her will, and acknowledged the
full power of her radiant beauty; so, it was evident, did also
Monsieur Laurent, a foreigner and Frenchman, who, after travelling
over the rest of the known world, had been for the last three weeks
lying ? perdu? at Port Arthur, busily engaged in studying the
Flora of Tasmania, which is here peculiarly rich and varied. Poor
man! after having passed scathless through the ordeal of Parisian
fascination, and Circassian beauty; after listening with unenchanted
ears to the sweet voices of Italia?s syrens; after gazing unmoved
on Indian voluptuousness ?to fall, an unsuspecting and unpitied
victim to the charms of a Tasmanian maiden! Yet, so it was;
and for the last nine days Monsieur Laurent?s botanical researches
had been arrested, the wild flowers of the bush allowed to blossom
and fade as they would, and even the choicest specimens of a
hortus siccus to remain uncared for, in the patent press that stood
in his room, just in the front of the eastern window ! Though of
no great personal beauty, Monsieur Laurent was gifted with the
national ? gentilite? of manners, that is so prepossessing in French-
men, and his broken English, wretchedly pronounced, and per-
fectly independent of grammar, was delivered with all the ease of
an accomplished conversationist. He was rather below the middle
height; his clever countenance was enlivened by a pair of spark-
ling grey eyes, so restless in their movements, that it seemed im-
possible for them ever to close in sleep, even for the shortest nap.
His travelling companion was as different from him as possible;
an Englishman, of average height, fair hair, thickly sprinkled with
white, and mild blue eyes, that bespoke their owner of the Wil-
berforce school; his voice was low and peculiarly calm, his words
fell clear and gently on the ear, like drops of water from a summer
fountain; his benevolent gaze seemed to meet you like that of


some tried old comrade, and when we parted from him, we sor-
rowed as though we had lost a friend. He was the best picture of
man?s declining years that I have ever seen, I, myself, whose
description I shall omit, completed the group.
When we were all comfortably ensconced in the boat, and had
fairly started on our expedition, we had leisure to admire the love-
liness of the scene, bathed as it was in the light of the morning
sun; behind, the white buildings of the settlement glittered
amidst foliage of the richest green, rising on the sides and crown-
ing the summit of the little hill that rose abruptly from the water?s
edge; here and there a small cottage, the residence of some
government officer, peeped forth picturesquely, from a garden gay
with flowers; while the tall spire of the church, and the large
store-like looking buildings on the wharf, contributed to the
illusive effect of the whole: for, strange to say, Port Arthur looks
rather like a pretty English village, than the abode, as it is, of the
accumulated crime and moral wretchedness of the whole United
Kingdom. But it is not my intention to enter upon so sad a sub-
ject as that of convictisra; suffice it to say, therefore, that though
every visitor to Port Arthur must, at first, be painfully influenced
by the sights and sounds that surround him, the hardened scowl
of the criminals, the clanking of their iron fetters; yet he soon
becomes so accustomed to it all, that it ceases to offend him, is
scarcely even observed: thus we had met that morning in our
general spirits, and if at times a less happy thought than usual
intruded on our minds, as we watched the swarthy, desperate-
looking crew that plied their oars in unbroken silence, it was en-
tertained but for a moment, like an unwelcome visitor, and then
flung aside for a more congenial topic.
But to return to the landscape, which has remained undescrihed
during this digression?before us stretched the clear blue waters
of Long Bay, a deep inlet of the Southern Ocean, the narrow,


rock-bound entrance to which was visible in the distance on our
right, while in front and on our left, the bay, after extending about
three miles, was bounded by a series of high, rounded hills, clothed
from base to summit in the sombre hues of Tasmanian foliage.
An hour?s rowing brought our boat to the foot of one of the
hills at the northern extremity of the bay ; here we landed at a
wooden pier, and seated ourselves in the little open carriages that
were destined to cpnvey us along a tramway to Norfolk Bay station,
our second stopping place. This mode of conveyance was cer-
tainly novel, though at first by no means of the pleasantest; in
front of each carriage on either side projected a strong iron bar,
which served as a handle for two men, who propelled the vehicle
at a speed which seemed perfectly astonishing to all unaccustomed
to such a species of locomotion; now along a level road, cut
between tall gums, that over-arched and shaded us; now up a
steep acclivity, now again into the valley beyond, along we went,
the wild beauty of the scene according well with the still wilder
faces that surrounded us.
Except for this one pathway, there was no sign of man?s ever having
trodden this ground, so unbroken everywhere was the rich
luxuriance of nature ; on each side the earth was covered with
flowering shrubs of every size and hue, from the delicate-tinted
native rose, that loves companionship with the earth, to the gay,
golden-eyed mimosa, with its tall, prickly stems and gracefully
drooping branches: occasionally a bright winged bird, the purple
Wren or the variegated rosella, flew across the path; and the
cheerful, ? chatty? voice of the miner, alternated with the solitary,
desponding note of the distant quail.
After a five mile ride we arrived at the jetty of Norfolk Bay
station, having traversed the Peninsula at one of its narrowest
parts, in a direct northerly course. This is the place were the


government steamer from Hobart Town stops, when it brings
down a fresh lot of sentenced men, and the few visitors that occa-
sionally find their way to this interesting spot.
Here another boat awaited us, which we quickly entered, as the
day was advancing, and we had still far to go. Keeping a northerly
direction for about a mile and a-half, we passed Woody Island on
the left, and by a sharp turn to the right entered a narrow bay,
upwards of two miles in length, which led to the isthmus called
Eagle Hawk Neck. This isthmus, as is well-known, connects
Tasman?s with Forester?s Peninsula, which latter is joined to the
mainland at its north-western extremity by East Bay Neck. Eagle
Hawk Neck is a narrow strip of land only seventy-eight yards
across, consisting of two low, grass-grown hillocks, and a sandy
pass between them. These hillocks are connected with the two
peninsulas, one branching away to the lofty hills of the southern,
or Tasman?s, the other in a northerly direction to Forrester?s.
Being the chief point for which deserters make, in the hope of
reaching the mainland. Eagle Hawk Neck is strongly guarded by
constables, a company of soldiers, and a chain of dogs, which latter
are stationed some on one side, some on the other of the above-
mentioned hillocks : on their summit a sentinel is placed, ready to
give the alarm on the slightest suspicion.
On our approach we were greeted with a furious barking from a
couple of dogs chained on elevated wooden stages, at different
distances from the shore. Regardless, however, of their loudly
expressed opposition to our plans, we disembarked, and examined
the baskets to make sure that nothing had been forgotten, and
then set forward by means of that primitive conveyance which is
usually (?) denominated ? Adam?s curricle.?
On issuing from the narrow pass, which we crossed from west to
east, a magnificent spectacle burst upon the view; before us lay


the wide, illimitable expanse of ocean, rolling in billowy, foam-
crested waves up to our very feet, while in the distance it heaved
and rocked, with gentle yet ever varying motion, its white-winged,
bird-like wavelets, dancing and gleaming in the cloudless sunshine;
a sail was seen on the distant verge of the horizon, looking like a
spirit messenger from the polar regions of ice and snow; while on
either side of the spot on which we stood, the shore arched out-
wards and formed the beautiful, semicircular cove called Pirate s
Bay; on the left hand the furthest promontory was bold and pre-
cipitous, its basaltic cliffs dipping perpendicularly into the deep
blue waters beneath ; while on the right the land sank gradually
and terminated in a long, low headland, covered with grass and a
few stunted trees. It was in this direction that we turned our
steps. The party rapidly broke up into little sections, following
the good old rule that ? two are company, three are not: the
gentlemen possessed themselves of all superfluous mantles and
shawls, and were rewarded by bright smiles, and the exhortation
? not to lose them.?
The superb Bella Donna looked methought less regal than was
her wont as she listened to the entertaining speeches of her bo-
tanical admirer ?What can she be smiling at now ? Surely there
is nothing in that pretty white everlasting, which M. Laurent has
just gathered and presented to her, that can account for the
sudden improvement visible in her usually too fair cheek ? Ah!
M. Laurent! M. Laurent! Alas for the hortus siccus!
We walked along the sandy beach for a mile or more, now
picking up the pretty razor and pheasant shells which the tide
had left behind, now stopping to examine the so-called
tesselated pavement, or curiously marked beds of rock, which
jutted out here and there in large horizontal masses. At
length the long wished for turning appeared, and we struck
off into a track on the right, that led us into the depths of the


bush: here was seen the same wild luxuriance of flowering shrubs
that had already so deeply charmed us; we no longer wonderec
at poor Hylas, of Moorish memory, and could easily, like him
have forgotten, not merely a task, but even an anticipated pleasure
in a longer ramble among the sweet beauties of Nature?s garden;
but the sun was now high in the heavens, and symptoms ol
impatient hunger became more and more evident in the van of the
party; so we pushed on resolutely for three-quarters of an hour,
the whole time continuing a gradual ascent. At length the
welcome cry of ? here we are,? broke from the foremost of our
number, and all who had not been there before were exhorted to
shut their eyes and entrust themselves to the guidance of more
veteran leaders; we followed the injunction, and were led forward
a few steps, then we stood still.
On opening my eyes, an involuntary start would have precipi-
tated me into an abyss, had I not been firmly held. Before me,
but separated by an awful chasm, rose a gigantic natural arch or
bridge, its lofty sides and roof, formed, seemingly, of massive
masonry: huge blocks of sandstone, of every size and hue, were
piled in regular order, one above another; here and there the
sharp tooth of time had broken away a ponderous morsel, hurling
it into the black abyss beneath; while in the crevices thus formed,
the bright-eyed everlasting and sweet-scented daisy had fixed their
tiny fibres, leaving their graceful stems as if in fearless innocence
over the precipitous cliff. The roof of the arch was straight, or
nearly so, presenting an appearance of slightly rounded angles
from one point only: long creeping plants, and grassy tufts, and
low branching shrubs hung over it, while above, on the summit,
tall gum trees grew, dwindling by comparison into mere straggling
thickets. Looking beneath the arch, the eye glanced up a rocky
tunnel, about fifty yards in length, and narrowing slightly at the
further end: here, strange to say, rolled in with thundering sound
blue, wind-driven waves, which broke with giant sweep against


Ie walls of the massive tunnel, dashing their spray high up its
me-worn sides: at the base of the arch, in the chasm beneath
i, the water lay still and calm in inky blackness, scarcely answer-
ing with audible voice to the messenger stone that we threw into
its fathomless depths. Three hundred and seventy feet was the
height of this extraordinary natural edifice, the width of the
chasm, one hundred feet.
We stood before it in silent admiration, and felt as though we
could never gaze enough; none of us, not even either of the
travellers, had ever seen its equal; we walked along the dizzy
brink, now viewing it from one point, now from another, and
from all it looked equally grand, and strange, and startling. How
had it been formed ? What mighty agency had cleft the rocks
on which we stood, and opened that deep abysmal chasm ? How
many ages had Old Ocean beat unceasingly against the stony
rock, ere he could wear a passage for himself into the bowels of
the earth, and sound in subterranean halls the mighty music of
his own eternal sphere ?
While thus we mused and wondered, the more practical of the
party had selected a convenient spot for the discussion of the
long desired luncheon, and in due time we were summoned to
the ? spread.? Corks had already been drawn, fowls dissected,
hams sliced, and deep gorges cut into the pies that garnished our
rural board; at a little distance the pleasant sound of a tea-kettle
was heard, hissing on the fire; and as the sun just then obligingly
retired behind a silvery cloud, we were able to devote ourselves
with undivided attention to the appeasing of our carnivorous
appetites. During the repast, our plans for the afternoon were
discussed. Mr. R. and Lieutenant Laughton, who knew the
ground, were for pushing on to the Blowhole, another natural
phenomenon, well worth seeing. The only drawback to this was
the distance we should have to walk, as the Blowhole was situated
on the extreme end of the promontory already mentioned.


Monsieur Laurent and his friend proposed a ramble round the
arch to the precipitous cliffs beyond ; they were only a hundred
yards off, and would afford us, from their height, a magnificent
view of the Southern Ocean, as well as a slight glimpse of the
entrance at their base to the arch : this they thought, combined
with a few botanical researches, would occupy the time until the
declining sun should warn us to depart. The ladies were unani-
mous in advocating the necessity of an hour?s rest; they, however,
received in silence the obliging offer of Monsieur Laurent to
suspend his botanical studies, and entertain them by reading
aloud. At length he was persuaded to embrace his original
intention, and resign the task of entertainment to the Lieutenant.
Having chosen a shady seat under a clump of trees, whence
they could command a view of the beautiful arch, and yet not be
incommoded by the sound of the water, most of the party retired
after luncheon to enjoy the volume of Tennyson, which was the
constant companion of the ?chevalier,? which he now read aloud
with considerable taste and feeling, stopping occasionally to
receive the remarks made on his favorite selections. Meanwhile
I seized my sketch-book, hastened to the spot which I had fixed
on in the morning, and abandoning myself wholly to ? the spirit
of the hour,? endeavoured to pourtray, however feebly, the grand
spectacle which nature had here prepared for her admirers. The
cloudless sky above, the thousand scents and hues around, the
utter stillness of the shadowing trees, the mighty chasm before
me, with the sounding waters that seethed and rocked at its base,
all worked like a spell upon my imagination, and ere long I had
wandered far into the misty realms of an artist?s dream. At length
the sketch was finished, the last few touches were lightly intro-
duced, and I still gazed at it with pleasure, yet regretfully, because
it answered so faintly to the ideal within, and the actual before
me, when I was roused from my reverie by the quick steps of
several of the party, who, with scared faces and trembling voice


announced the dreadful intelligence that Monsieur Laurent had
disappeared, and could no where be found! Growing alarmed at
his absence, as the hour of rendezvous was long past, they had
traversed the bush a considerable distance in every direction, and
had called again and again in vain, making the woods resound
with the far-reaching ?cooey.? Was it possible that he could
have fallen from the cliffs ? The idea was too dreadful to be
entertained, yet it was scarcely less so to suppose that he had
wandered away and become entangled in the intricacies of the
bush, which here covers hill and valley alike with unbroken
denseness.
Tales of travellers lost on Mount Wellington rose in our minds
as we stood and looked at each other, and for the moment a
sickening fear seemed completely to paralyze our energies. The
day was far advanced ?would it be better to hurry back to Eagle
Hawk Neck and give the alarm at once, or make another attempt
to find him before night came on ? At length, the last was
decided on: the ladies were entreated to remain together at the
arch, while the gentlemen dispersed once more in different direc-
tions, hallooing as they went, to attract his attention. But to no
purpose?at the end of another hour they returned once more,
weary and dispirited, without having met with the slightest
success. It was now decided that Lieutenant Laughton, the most
active of the party, should hurry hack to the Neck, give the alarm,
and return with men well furnished with provisions and lights,
to prosecute the search during the night; the rest should return
more slowly, being quite broken down with this sad termination
to their day?s enjoyment; but nothing could induce Mr. Harford
to accompany us; he would not leave the spot, lest his friend
should return to it meanwhile, and find himself apparently
abandoned. He could pass the night very well he said, under a
sheltering rock, if we left him a few wrappers to keep out the
chill. We therefore prepared for our departure, and had just


adjusted the last cloak, and closed the provision basket, when a
slight rustle among the bushes attracted our united attention
A moment?s suspense, and who should emerge from the thickets
but our lost friend, Monsieur Laurent! A general burst of delight
welcomed his arrival! The ladies wept and grew pale, the
gentlemen flushed and confusedly talkative. But, alas! it was
not the well-attired Monsieur Laurent of the morning that
stood before us. A sad change had come come over him;
pale and weary, in torn garments, and without a hat, he
tottered forward a few steps, and then sank exhausted on the
ground. A glass or two of wine soon restored him, however, and
overwhelmed with questions, he found breath to relate his adven-
tures. His curiosity having been roused by Mr. R.?s description
of the Blowhole, he had determined to see it, so he set forward
on tlffi route pointed out to him in the morning, along the beach,
across the narrow inlet of water, up the little hilly promontory,
and along its summit to the furthest extremity, where the Blowhole
was situated; it was, he said, very similar to the arch, but on a
much smaller scale.
Having completed his survey, and finding that it was time to
return to the place of rendezvous, he retraced his steps as far as
the narrow inlet of water; but found, to his amazement, that the
tide had risen so high as to preclude all hope of crossing it; he
therefore made a long and difficult detour through the bush; now
descending into a valley overgrown with thick brushwood, out
of which he could scarcely force a passage, now climbing the steep
hills that lay between himself and the arch. Time, which waits
for no man, seemed to fly with double speed to him, so that he
soon gave up all hope of finding us still at the place of picnic;
yet thought it best to make for that spot while it was light, as the
rest of the way would be easy enough. His botanical box he had
thrown away as an incumbrance; his hat had been lost and
his clothes torn in ? dat attrocious diable of one valley,? which


he ceased not to anathematize in broken English and fluent
French, to the evident relief of his excited feelings. We listened
with interest, but could no longer laugh at his amusing descrip-
tions : the matter had looked so very serious, that it required time
ere we could view it in any other light. His only regret, on the
contrary, was, that he should have shown such apparent want of
politeness in detaining us here; he assured us that he was ?au
desespoir? at the thought of it, and volunteered to proceed at
once on our route : "this, however, we would not agree to, as the
nights were then mild and light, and it mattered little at what
hour we returned. Poor Mr. Harford, indeed, looked completely
worn out with fatigue and anxiety, for he was not strong, and had
over exerted himself in looking for his young friend, whom he
now gazed at with beaming eyes, their placid blue occasionally
dimming with moisture.
And she, the stately beauty, our queenly Bella Donna ?how
does the day?s short tragedy affect her ? She has shown of all
the least excitement, the least interest in the fate of Monsieur
Laurent ?she, to whom so many of his daily offerings were brought!
And now she sits with silent lips and marble brow, as though his
words could find no echo in her thoughts. And is it so ? Is she
indeed so callous ? Or are the tablets of her memory so deeply
graved with the markings of the terrible past the past of a few
short hours, that the present glides over them uncomprehended,
or but - faintly understood? As those whose eyes have long been
bandaged in severe sickness can no longer bear the full brightness
of the morning light. Ah! the hidden life how deep, how dark
its waters; and darkest and deepest still, where their surface sleeps
the calmest!
The conclusion of the day?s adventure needs but a short descrip-
tion : reader, you can imagine it all; how fatigue and weariness
vanished when once we had set out on our homeward walk; how


we met the Lieutenant with his party of men, and rejoiced together
that their services were no longer needed; how we lingered in that
narrow sandy pass at Eagle Hawk Neck, to look our last on
Pirate?s Bay, and watch the setting sunlight on the distant waters;
how we passed along the pier and entered the boat which had for
hours been awaiting us; ?then the five miles journey through
that silent solemn forest, whose dark shadows slept in the moon-
light?s radiant arms; ?then the rowing across Long Bay, where
every stroke of the oars woke a mimic flash of liquid lightning in
the phosphorescent waters; ?then the landing at the garden jetty;
the bright well lit drawing-room, with its kind thoughtful hostess
ready to receive us; the refreshing tea; the amusing narration of
our day?s adventures; and lastly?shall we hint the secret ?
the whisper that went round among us, that M. Laurent?s
misfortunes had been but blessings in disguise, winning to him
this day the fair hand and heart of Tasmania?s loveliest rose !
No, we need not tell all this. Reader, thou mayest have guesed
it already. Adieu.


LIFE?S TREASURES.
They drop away ?an unseen hand
Doth shake at times the tree of life;
And from its sunlit branches fall
Youth?s flowers, how fresh ! with bloom how rife !
They-drop away ?in vain we stand
To watch each blossom in its fall;
To trust the rest may yet be spared;
To mourn the last, the loved of all!
They drop away ?our hearts are wrung.
With parting from these treasures sweet:
When shall we learn to lay them, Lord,
A willing offering at Thy feet ?
SILENZIO.
SPRING.
Spring is coming ! Hark, its whisper
Lightly on the breeze is borne;
And the fragrance of its breathing
Rises with the dewy morn.
Leaf by leaf, each flower uncloses,
Smiles at all the beauty round;
Smileth at the greater beauty,
That in its own breast is found.


Calmer flows the restless river.
Lulling to a measured flow;
All the wild tumultuous rushing
Of the winter?s gathered snow.
Clearer grow its turbid waters.
Till within their depths at rest.
Sees itself, the heaven reflected,
And the white cloud on its breast.
Like a slumbering babe it lieth
Cradled in its mother?s arms ;
Who, with eyes of liquid azure,
Guardeth it from all alarms.
And I wander by the river,
Where the scented wild flowers grow.
Looking on that cloud in heaven,
Looking in the stream below ;
And it seems to whisper softly,
Well-known words of long ago:
Songs and voices, heard in childhood,
Gentle figures, come and go.
Fragrance, as of hawthorn blossoms.
Skylarks song in early morn, ?
All that to my soul was dearest,
In this hour again is born.
And I gather them with gladness,
(Mournful, yet with gladness still,)
All these lost, revived memorials
Of my early hopes and will.


Welcome, even as withered blossoms
From the friend that?s far away.
Come to me these shadowy records
Of a life?s first bright spring day.
Silenzio.
LIGHT AND DAEKNESS.
LIGHT.
Oh, glorious Sun!
From the dark caverns of the night
Thou comest with thy golden light;
All hail unconquered one!
O?er the green land
Thou pourest forth thy smiling beams ;
Down drop thy flashing, dazzling gleams
From thy untiring hand.
Thy golden car
Rolls shining through the gates of day;
The dark clouds spread themselves away,
But stand and frown afar.
So on my heart
There comes a flood of gladness down ;
Though doubts yet stand aloof and frown,
And will not quite depart.


DARKNESS
Oh, gentle night!
Thy noiseless step comes gliding on;
The beauty of the day is gone
With the last gleam of light.
Thy touch, how mild!
How full of pitying love thy breast;
Oh, Ethiop mother, hush to rest
The earth, thy weary child.
Upon thy brow
There gleams a crescent jewel fair;
Bright gems flash through thy raven hair,
And shine upon me now.
Look up, my soul!
Know that thy path is never dark;
There still is light enough to mark
Thy high and glorious goal.

VIRGINIA ST.CLAIR.
A TALE.
Chapter I.
The impressions stamped upon the mind during the first years
of early childhood, are often more permanent than those received
at a later period of life. It is always with a lively interest, and
sometimes with profound regret, that we look back upon our
earliest days, when, undisturbed by care or painful thoughts,
unconscious of error, and beaming with innocent gaity, we played
in the green meadows of our native land, with those who are now
no more. With a lightness of heart as well as of foot, to which
we have been for many years a stranger, we have pressed the green
sward of sweet Wicklow?s romantic hills and glens, and wandered
along the banks of her beautiful rivulets. We have clambered to
the top of her highest mountains, and plunged to the lowest
depths of her rocky and water-worn dells. Thus, while the mind
recalls the happiness of those days, memory is busy, and culls as
it were from a mine of wealth, the choicest gems of personal
experience or communicated narrative.
There once stood, and perhaps still stands, on an eminence in
the neighbourhood of one of Wicklow?s loveliest glens, a solitary
habitation. It was built of white stone, yet so discoloured were
the external walls, that the period at which it had been constructed
roust have been one of great antiquity. The curiosity of the
passing traveller could not fail to be excited by the singular
appearance of this desolate mansion. The narrow and highly


arched door, the small square windows, to the number of four on
each side of the building, gave it the appearance of having been
constructed for the purposes of defence. It might have served,
however, as the residence of some quiet family, who, wishing to
shun the noise and bustle of the capital, delighted in solitude and
romantic scenery. But at the commencement of the present
century, it was inhabited by four individuals, who, seemingly
impenetrable to visitors, and seldom showing themselves outside
their narrow doorway, soon became a mystery to the entire neigh-
bourhood. The master of this singular residence was a tall and
slightly built man, evidently about fifty years of age. His name
was St. Clair, and as he styled himself Captain, it was generally
supposed that he had served his country either in the army or navy;
but no one was accurately acquainted with his former life or
present pursuits. He was a mystery in his appearance. The
aspect of his features was harsh and stern; his eyes were dark,
small and piercing; his face, pale and habitually calm, could not
be used as an index of his mind. His hair, very thin and slightly
tinged with grey, hung in loose curls over the collar of a faded
black cloak, in which his person was almost always enveloped.
His step, as he occasionally walked to and fro before the door of
his dwelling, was stately and firm. His chest was prominent, his
limbs, though slender, were vigorous and well shaped ; and when
we add that on his thin and wasted lips, no person had ever
remembered to have seen the most distant resemblance to a smile,
we have finished, however imperfectly, a picture repulsive and
disdainful in its perceptible outlines.
If St. Clair ever wandered from the immediate precincts of his
dwelling, he always made choice of such times as placed him, in
some degree, beyond the inquisitive gaze of his fellow men. The
peasants of the country often amused each other with stories of
having encountered on some lonely road, at early dawn, or by the
dusky twilight of evening, a tall figure, closely wrapped in a black


cloak; and the young maidens who carried water from the road-side
well, or ventured into the plantations of luxuriant fir, birch and holly,
in search of twigs to light their cottage fires, had often fled in terror
at the real or fancied approach of this singular being. Various
were the suppositions entertained by the gossips as to who he was,
and what he had been: and that most favorably received, was, that
he was a retired pirate ; though many people would not believe
this, hut held that he was a political refugee from the continent
of Europe. However that matter may have been, it is certain
that his house, from its dark and inhospitable appearance, was
widely known as the Black Castle; and within its impenetrable
walls, the story ran, a fair and lovely girl was shut up, almost as a
prisoner, from the soothing influence of all human society.
This beautiful creature was not an actual prisoner in Black
Castle, but for all the liberty she enjoyed, or was allowed to enjoy,
might just as well have been one; for if she ever attempted to
wander along the neighbouring hedges, or gather wild flowers in
the adjacent meadows, St. Clair himself, her reputed father, or an
old domestic, would quickly follow and bring her back to her
gloomy dwelling. She was permitted to cultivate a small flower
garden, in which, however, she was not often seen. She was in
her seventeenth year. Her face wore the expression of extreme
loveliness, rendered more charming by her heightened color, which
went and came in unison with the different emotions which alter-
nately agitated her gentle breast. Her features were regular, but
small and exquisitely chiselled. Her eyes were not black, like her
father?s, but were brilliantly blue, and sparkled with all the
animation of youth and a high spirit. Her hair, which hung in
curls of the richest profusion over a graceful and snow white neck,
was light brown, and was bound by a bright blue silken braid,
which contrasted well with the high and fresh color of her counte-
nance. With teeth of purest whiteness, and small hands which
might have rivalled the most beautifully polished marble; the face


and figure of Virginia St. Clair might have formed appropriate
models for a sculptor, she having been, in the opinion of many, an
almost perfect specimen of female beauty.
Such were the father and the daughter. How two persons so
unlike each other, and so decidedly opposed in figure, face, and
appearance, could have been so related, was a wonder and a
mystery to all. The inaccessible gloom and repulsive nature of
the former, were slightly shared by the latter, though not in a
similar degree. If St. Clair happened to meet a stranger, more
inquisitive than polite, he never seemed to shrink, but generally
returned no answer to any question, and accompanied an impatient
gesture by a haughty scowl. If Virginia met with any rambling
botanist, or even if she only heard a strange voice or song, she
ran or seemed to fly from the spot in dismay, and paused not
until she was safe within the sphere of her father?s influence; ?if
she ever so far escaped his watchful vigilance. But there were
times when this vigilance was much relaxed, for St. Clair would
sometimes pass whole days in the closest retirement, and in the
most dismal mental dejection; when the care of Virginia would
devolve upon their two servants, an elderly man and his venerable
helpmate. This antiquated couple performed all the necessary
domestic offices at Black Castle, though their labour was not heavy,
nor their remuneration light.
The interior of this gloomy mansion was scarcely more comfort-
able than its outward appearance indicated. One room, certainly,
and only one, seemed to be tenanted by a person who possessed
an elegant taste, though not expensive habits. This was Virginia?s
sitting room. The apartment was small, and but scantily furnished,
yet its extreme neatness, and the addition of many ornamental
articles of female workmanship, gave it an air of seductive comfort.
One small square window, with an eastern aspect, lighted this
room; and as the beams of the rising sun entered by this aperture,


Virginia was generally seated quietly at her work, or before her
harp, touching the strings to the sound of her own sweet voice.
A few books of the more feminine character were arranged on her
table, which was covered with a beautifully embroidered cloth, the
work of her own fair hands. A few unpretending pictures hung
upon the walls. A soft carpet covered the floor; and in cold
weather, a cheerful fire burned in the grate. On the whole, this
room seemed to' have been (contradictory as it may appear)
prepared by a fond father to gratify the desires, and indulge the
taste, of a much loved daughter.
The private room of St. Clair was situated on the same floor,
but at the opposite side of the building. It contained a long, low
table, covered with faded red cloth, upon which various books and
papers were scattered in careless negligence. There was no attempt
at comfort in this room; the floor was of stone, worn at the sides
and corners into deep fui?rows, by the agitated walking to and fro
of the occupant. Two wooden chairs, heavy and old fashioned,
stood, one by the wall and the other at the table; a heavy and
strongly-bound chest of large dimensions had its place at one side,
while in a corner stood an iron safe, such as are peculiar to the
offices of merchants. But the most peculiar feature in this curious
apartment remains to he mentioned; the proprietor s taste for
arms, of all descriptions, seemed without a parallel in any private
establishment. Guns, pistols, swords, and daggers, were ranged
irregularly on the walls; and, most singular feature of ally a large
square patch of black cloth covered the wall above the fire-place,
evidently intended to conceal some picture or portrait.
In a front room, cheerfully furnished, St. Clair and his daughter
took their meals together, waited upon by their faithful domestics ;
therefore conversation on such occasions was not generally animated,
and at other times they scarcely met, or spoke at all. Thus the
time passed slowly and tediously, until the events happened which
we will, with the reader?s kind permission, attempt to describe in
the succeeding chapter.


Chapter 11.
The evening of a stormy day in March fell slowly over the pic-
turesque hills and vales surrounding the weather-worn habitation
of Captain St. Clair. The ruddy tints of the setting sun were re-
flected from the summits of the adjoining mountains; and the trees
from their waving tops seemed to bid farewell to the departing
orb of day. The wind, which had blown throughout the day with
all the fury of a gale, had partially subsided, and now swept along
the green meadows in fitful gusts ; while the heavy clouds, spread-
ing themselves over the face of the sky, threatened a thunder
storm, or a renewal of the tempest on the morrow. By degrees,
the lovely face of nature was wrapt in total darkness; and every-
thing became shrouded in gloomy obscurity and silence, save when
the wind, in sudden blasts, shook the trees; or when the waters of
the brook gurgled incessantly over the polished pebbles. It was
in this dark hour that two individuals approached the rising ground
whereon St. Clair?s house was built. They did not walk in com-
pany : each was alone, and fancied himself unobserved, and
each bent upon projects which had some reference to the other.
The first of these was a young man of vigorous step and stout
proportion, who, notwithstanding the darkness of the night, seemed
to surmount the obstacles in his way with comparative ease. He
was carefully enveloped in a huge watch-coat, sufficiently ample to
cover, at least, half-a-dozen others; and round his muscular neck
and shoulders a thick woollen shawl was wrapped, as if with ma-
ternal care. As he drew near the house on which his contemplations
were evidently bent, he became more cautious in his movements,
and paused when he reached the hedge surrounding the little
flower garden before mentioned. It was well for him that he made
this pause, for in a few moments he heard a heavy step approach-
ing, and had scarcely time to conceal himself beneath the hedge,
when a man passed quickly by. Very much alarmed at the risk
he ran of being discovered in such a place, and at such a time, the


young man crept through the hedge, and remained perfectly quiet
for a while.
After the lapse of ten or twelve minutes he rose cautiously and
with great care, but without noise, reconnoitered the place in
which he found himself. He was in the little flower garden,
mostly cultivated by the hands of Virginia St. Clair, and was not
many paces from the window of her little sitting room. With
breathless anxiety he peered round this garden, every moment
fearful of stumbling on some luckless intruder; he could discover
no one, however, and having tried to convince himself that he was
unobserved, he stretched forth his hand and knocked slightly on the
window, which, up to that moment, had displayed a cheerful light.
This was now suddenly extinguished, and the room remained
lighted only by the embers of a decaying fire. Ihe visitors
knock remained unnoticed, until he repeated it somewhat louder,
and said in a low voice, " Virginia,?Miss St. Clair let me speak
to you! ?
? What would you with me, Edward Percival?? said the young
lady, as she partly opened the window and looked forth with a
fluttering heart and trembling voice; ?have I not forbidden you
to come here ? Did I not tell you that you could not alter my
resolution, and why will you trouble me thus ? ?
" Only listen to me for a few minutes,? replied the young man.
?Oh Virginia, I have reason to tremble for your safety?a strange
vessel is on the coast, and the man who has excited the sus-
picions of the lieutenant has been seen. Be decided, be wise, and
fly before it is too late.?
? You have had my answer before this,? said A irginia; tempt
me no farther with your fair reasons and beguiling tongue.
? For the love of heaven! Virginia, listen to reason; my mother
has prepared everything and expects you; a happy home, not a
dark, comfortless one like this, but a bright sunny bower prepared
by my mother?s hands and my own, awaits you; a fond heart


O how fond! ? longs for you. Believe me there is mischief brew-
ing, for even now a stranger is prowling about your dwelling.?
? A stranger ?? said Virginia, alarmed; ? did you see him ??
? See him I did most certainly, and he very nearly saw me too,?
said Edward; ?he was not so tall as your father, but walked just
as erect and stiffly.?
? I?ll see if my father is in his room,? said the maiden. She
went accordingly, but soon returned and told the young man that
her father was in his room, hut was not alone, as she had heard
voices in conversation.
? If,? said Edward, ? this should be the villian Crawley, you
are undone, Virginia. ? Not many months ago he attempted to
tear you from your father?s arms, and now I tell you he has been
seen near this, and his vessel is on the coast. My dearest girl?
my only love,? he added passionately; ?be persuaded, be ruled,
and confide yourself to my care ?more tender by far than your
father?s has ever been; and when you are settled, when we are
united beyond the possibility of separation, what is to prevent you
throwing yourself on your father?s mercy, and seeking his forgive-
ness ? ?
? You know not my father, or you would not speak thus,? re-
plied Virginia. ?He loves me I know ?I am sure ?but were Ito
leave him, he would hate me with a hatred more deadly than that
of an adder. You know him not.?
? I have no wish to know him,? answered Percival; ? a man
that spurned me from his presence, and who seems to regard all
mankind with equal hatred.?
? I will not listen to you if you go on thus,? interrupted the
young girl.
? You have a right?you will listen to me,? said Edward; ? are
you not my betrothed bride ? Did you not promise to be mine,
and mine only? You told me that when social storms were
gathering around you, you would take refuge in my home and in
my arms. The time is come now. Do you not remember when.


six years ago, you used to escape from your deaf schoolmistress,
and ramble with me along Killiney?s beautiful shore, indulging in
innocent talk and gay dreams of the future ? You have not for-
gotten your childish play with my brothers and only sister, now
far away; or the shells, or the pebbles, or the wild flowers I have
gathered for you; and you must still remember my kind mother,
how she fondly welcomed you to our sea-side home, and said, how
often, that you should be her second daughter. Though our
home is changed, and I am master of a fortune, I have them still,
the very dog you used to play with, and the pony you used to
ride. Come then to us once more, Virginia, and bring back those
happy days! ?
'ldle burning tears fell rapidly from the maiden?s eyes as she
listened to this eloquent appeal, and a short time elapsed before
she was able to reply. With a faltering voice she at length said,
? Edward, now hear me once for all. If you could offer me the
wealth of India, and the glory of a princess, I would not desert my
father. You would only despise me hereafter, and I should deserve
it; my mind is made up, and seek not to alter my decision with
words either of love or bitterness. I was a child six years ago,
and you were but a boy; you are still young, and you have fortune
and health, go then and seek through the wide world for some
one more worthy of you, and forget the partner of you childish
wanderings.?
? I s it your wish, Virginia, that I should forget all your promises ?
asked the young man.
? My wish is that you should do whatever contributes mostly to
your own happiness,? answered V irginia.
? Then, farewell, obdurate girl! but we part in peace ;-hap-
piness does not exist for me while you arc absent, and the best
gifts of fortune are bestownd in vain: may God protect you since
you will not permit me.?
Saying these words Edward affectionately kissed the object of
his love, and slowly departed.

The estate of which young Percival was the proprietor (through
the death of his father, some two years previously), was situated
at the distance of ten miles from the village of Bray, from which
St. Clair?s house was only four miles distant. It was in the most
beautiful part of the country, and enclosed within its broad
boundaries some of the most superb scenes of nature?s own making,
for which the romantic county of Wicklow is so justly celebrated.
The genius of a Scott, with all his splendid powers of description,
would fail, in some degree, to convey even a slight idea of the
grandeur of these hills and valleys ?not the bold and rough mag-
nificence of Scotch highland scenery perhaps ?but the quiet and
sylvan beauties more peculiar to the sister island, and how then
can the present writer hope to do so. A small, though exceedingly
pretty river flowed through this estate, winding with tranquil
sweetness through the grassy and flowered plain, and anon pur-
suing its course through a deep glen, where it bounded from rock
to rock with never ceasing turbulence. Meadows and corn fields
of the richest green, here and there dotted with neat white cottages
and cabins, built of stone without morter, and thatched with straw,
met the eye in all directions; while three-fourths of the horizon
was bounded by hills and mountains, the deep blue color of which
was seen on fine clear days in strong relief against the bright sky.
On the fourth side was the sea, and not very far from the shore,
the residence of Edward Percival stood upon a level plain of no
great extent. The house was large, and elegant in its appearance,
and seemed to be in every way suitable for the dwelling place of
a family of rank. It was a modern building of oblong form, its
highly decorated front facing the sea and the rising sun.
Of the family of Percival it is not necessary to say much; but
Edward was a noble and generous youth, of high blood, deep
feeling, and romantic aspirations after fame and happiness. His
countenance and figure, without being strictly handsome, were
agreeable and without defects; while his refined manners and
polite conversation, gained for him the reputation of being a very


well-bred gentleman indeed. The old ladies (we beg their pardon)
liked him because he paid them a considerable share of his attentions;
the young ladies liked him as a spirited partner in the dance, and
a pleasing companion at a picnic or boating excursion. Ihe
gentlemen, both old and young, were fond of his society, for he was
a daring huntsman, and did the honors of his house with becoming
liberality and uniform kindness to all. The peasantry of the sur-
rounding country ?-his own tenants, and those of other gentlemen
?had no fault to find with him; and the beggars, male and.
female, of whom there were at that time no small number, were
seen at all hours of the day climbing over the park walls, being
generally refused admittance by the gatekeeper, to pay their visits
to Mrs. Percival?s kitchen, from which they never were seen to
retire empty handed.
With a sad heart, and a heavy presentiment of evil, on account
of some communications received from his friend, the Lieutenant
of the Coast-Guard Service ?Edward Percival pursued his way to
the hovel called an inn where he had left his horse. The night was
very dark, and the rain fell heavily; still not wishing to remain at
a house where the accommodation was miserable in the extreme,
and unwilling to meet, if possibly he might be abroad, with the
object of his and the lieutenant?s suspicions, without a legal war-
rant for his detention, he hastily partook of such refreshments as
the place afforded, and mounting his horse, recommenced his
journey homewards.
He had not proceeded fax?, however, before it suddenly entered
his mind that it was undoubtedly his duty, if he had the least idea
that Miss St. Clair was in any danger, to remain in her immediate
neighbourhood for a while, and afford her the best protection in
his power. He checked his horse, and mused for a short time.
Should he return to the inn, or go back to St. Clair?s house, for
the purpose of opening a communication with old Dorothy, the
confidential servant of Virginia; or why, he asked himself, should
he not proceed to the lieutenant?s quarters, and consult with him


as to the best course of action in this unhappy crisis. The charac-
ter of the man Crawley, a notorious smuggler and suspected pirate,
and his supposed intimacy with St. Clair, was sufficient to alarm
the sensitive mind of Edward Percival, with respect to the safety
of his betrothed. To see the lieutenant, seemed to be in his
opinion, the best plan he could adopt, and we will leave him to
pursue his journey, through the increasing rain and thickening
darkness.
Chapter 111.
Dudley St. Clair sat in his comfortless apartment, an open book
on the table before him, and a lamp, burning with a dim light,
beside it. He was not reading with much attention, for he
frequently lifted his eyes from the volume, and gazed anxiously
round the room. He listened to the gusts of wind as they swept
round the corners of his dwelling, with evident uneasiness, and he
sometimes arose from his chair, took two or three rapid strides
across the stone floor, and sat down again with a restless air and
dissatisfied countenance. After one of these unsuccesful attempts
to compose his disturbed mind to some degree of tranquility, a
peculiar knock on the door of his room made him start up again
in undisguised alarm; without delay, however, he drew back the
bolt ?admitted a closely muffled stranger ?fastened the door again,
and resumed his seat.
For awhile neither spoke. St. Clair sat calmly, his white fore-
head had grown still whiter, his lips had curled into a partial sneer
of defiance, and his dark eyes were bent with flashing fire on the
visitor he had admitted, who stood immediately in front of him,
with his back to the wall, while he returned St. Clair?s gaze with
perfect coolness and effrontery. He had taken off his cap, and
on his low forehead and sharp repulsive features could be traced
the presence of none of the nobler qualities of our nature. His


visage proclaimed him to be a reckless and cruel specimen of the
human species, and without going to the trouble of describing his
person minutely ?a person evidently not worth the trouble of
describing,?we will note down the remarkable conversation that
took place.
" So you are come,? said St. Clair.?
"Yes, you may make sure of that,? replied the stranger.
? But why so 'soon ? The last time you were here, you gave me to
understand that it was unlikely you should come again.
? Oh, as to that captain, a fellow?s at liberty to change his way
of thinking a bit. I thought so myself at the time mayhap, and
mayhap I didn?t; it matters little to Bill Crawley where I be, so
not exactly in the jaws of the sharks.?
?There is plenty of room for you elsewhere,? said St. Clair, in
a quiet tone; ? you might leave me alone I think, we have settled
all our scores and dissolved partnership, have we not ??
? Well, by the powers o? war, but you have a decent way of
treating an old friend,? said Crawley, with a sinister smile; you
don?t seem to have the good sense or good manners to ask me to
sit down, though I?ve been tramping this five or six mile to see
you, and all out of friendship too ; and when I knocks at your
door like a gentleman. I?m told to take myself off again, just a* if
I was an Irish policeman or any other beast.
? Well, what may your friendly business be ?? asked St. Clair.
? Oh, come, come now,? answered his visitor, " you?re not a gom
to poke me into a corner with your business. Don?t be so stiff, man,
or look as if you swallowed three dozen marlin spikes or belayin
pins, but out with your bottle of the craythur, or whatever your
Irish savages call it, and let?s see if I can?t make a marine of it.
Talking?s dry work such a night as this, and by I m affeard
I?ll have a wet walk back to where I came from.
The insolent familiarity of this man seemed particularly offensive
to St. Clair; but, from whatever cause he gulped down his rising


wrath, motioned his unwelcome guest to take the other chair,
drew forth from his iron safe a flask and goblet, which he placed
on the table, and again seated himself in silence.
? Won?t you take a glass for old acquaintance sake ?? said the
visitor.
? No,? was the laconic reply.
? Well, here?s to you then, you see I?m no ways proud; you
was always a stiff cove, but now you hold up your head like the
main trunk of a man-o?-war.?
? How did you get in ?? asked St. Clair.
? Get in!? answered Crawley, ? why, like an independent man to
be sure, walked right hang into the kitchen, and found that old crone
o? yours fast asleep by the fire, woke her up with a shake, and
asked where you was stowed; that?s how I got in; was afraid to
make a row at the front door, for fear of startlin? your young bird
within there.?
This allusion to his daughter, St. Clair received with great
uneasiness: he writhed painfully in his chair, while his cadaverous
countenance was twitched with convulsive contortions; ?after a
pause of some seconds, during which the stranger again applied
himself to the goblet and flask, he resumed the conversation,
unbending at the same time somewhat of the severity of his
manner.
? You have not told me, Crawley, concerning your last trip, and
its possible success.?
?Begad, I?m glad you?re beginning to talk sense at last,?
answered Crawley; ? the last trip was middlin fair, and as for
success, why, if you consider that the partnership is not quite dis-
solved, here?s your share of the plunder.?
The speaker pulled from his pocket a good sized bag of coin,
and laid it on the table. St. Clair slightly nodded.
?We only lost? resumed Crawley, ?one hundred and sixteen
out of three hundred and eighty-five; a mere trifle you know;
the balance, a fine healthy lot, was worth something when I ran


?em ashore. We were nearly gripped though by a ten gun brig,
but hauled off in a fog after thirty hours? hard runnin; lucky
escape, wasn?t it ??
? Decidedly so,? answered his host, looking, nevertheless, as if
he wished it had been otherwise.
? And then,? continued Crawley, ? when we started the cargo,
we painted a new name on the starn, lowered our spars a bit,
clapp?d on a fresh coat of tar, and called at Barbadoes for a load
of sugar, which we left to the honest care of Peter Flannagan,
Esquire, merchant, of Cork, and all done in less time than it would
take you to whip a cat, as the sayin is.?
?Well, what do you propose doing now ?? asked St. Clair.
? That?s just what I?m goin to tell ye,? replied Crawley; ? I
means to give up the trade, the work is too hard, and I?m growin
rheumatic. I?m goin to hand over the Flying Jenny to Sam
Flounder, my first officer, now in charge, and have agreed with
him to set me down on a quiet island in the South Sea, where I
intends to live peaceable, and become the father of a race of colo-
nists of true British blood and bone, with a sprinklin of Irish
blood to give ?em smartness.?
? I suppose then,? said St. Clair, ? that you wish to introduce
this Sam Flounder to me as his future agent.?
? Suppose no such thing, man,? said Crawley; ? Sam is no such
fool; you may trust me, or I may trust you, but Sam Flounder
won?t -trust everybody; he knows a trick or two, does Sam; he
was?nt my apprentice for nothin, I can tell you. Besides, if I did
introduce him to you, he might be more trouble to you than he s
worth. No, let him find his own friends. I?m goin to give up
business, and dissolve all partnerships except one, and what that
one is, I see you are in no hurry to talk about; though, from what
passed when I was here last, you ought to know as much about it
as I do.?
?If you presume to allude to ? St. Clair paused, and
his face grew still more livid.


? Then I do presume to allude to her in course,? said Crawley
emphatically.
? Then I?ll give you a short answer,? said St. Clair, quickly.
? Don?t say*nothin in a hurry,? said his visitor with a sneer, and
don?t talk so loud neither, you?ve got no child to deal with, to
blow about like a shuttlecock, as you like?and I?ll tell you. Mister
or Captain St. Clair, as I told you before, that I must have that
girl by fair means or foul.?
? You shall not have that girl, Crawley, while I am a living man,?
said St. Clair firmly.
? Then I will have her when you are a dead one,? said Crawley;
?and by heaven, you are fast in my grip?but withdraw your
senseless opposition, and we are friends once and for ever.?
?Why not,? said St. Clair, condescending to adopt atone of
expostulation, ? why not seek some one more suitable to your age
and habits ??there are plenty in the world ?consider her tender
years, and the quiet life she has led from her childhood. It is
worse than madness to think of tearing her from this ?the land of
her birth, ?and forcing her to accept a husband like you.?
? She might have a worse husband than I though, for all that,?
answered Crawley; ?what about my age ? If not so young, lam
still as stout and jolly as when I first had the honor of servin
under you, ?and as for the treatment she?s to get, what on earth
are you afraid of? You knows I was never a bad hearted fellow,
and having plenty of rhino, she?ll live up to her chin in silks, satins,
and all sorts of luxury, with as many black blackguards to wait
upon her as she can count pins in her pincushion.?
?Nevertheless,? said St. Clair, ?she will not suit you,?it
would kill her; seek some one else, and let us remain friends; but,
in any case, I will never force her to become your wife.?
? Oh, you need force nothing at all,? said the infatuated wretch,
? only leave that part of the business to me, and don?t interfere;
if you do, your blood be on your own head, that?s all; make up
your mind before this time to-morrow night, and don?t attempt to


give me the double in the mean time, for you can t stir an inch
from your door but what I knows it, so I?ll bid you good night-
better keep things dark than to blow the gaff too hard, captain,
eh ? When I?m snug in my little island with the black slavies
and the princess o? beauty, you?ll be quite safe, but not before.
Let me out, and see me to the front door, as you would any other
gentleman ?and remember to-morrow night.
?Dog, I defy'you!? said St. Clair, with his teeth set; and
springing to his feet, he attempted to snatch a cutlass from the wall,
but the rough hand of his visitor was instantly on his collar, while
in the other he held a cocked pistol, which he had drawn from his
breast, close to his opponent?s ear.
? Do you defy me, by ,? he muttered in the same sneering
tone; ?another start, now, or another word, and your brains will be
food for the cats before morning?budge a single inch now, and there
is not a saint in the calendar that can save you, my high blooded
cock-chaffer.?
? Well, unhand me then, I was wrong,? said St. Clair submis-
sively?? you have the advantage, take back your gold, I want it
not, and begone ?to-morrow night I will answer you.?
? Aye, and take care how you do answer me,? said Crawley, as
he followed St. Clair, who led the way to the door. ? I give you
no more fair warnings.?
He was gone, and St. Clair returned to his room.
If we attempted to describe how that night was spent at the
Black Castle, our tale would swell very far beyond the limits we
have prescribed for it. Our obliging readers can picture to them
selves how St. Clair, with his dark and gloomy mind, distracted
by a thousand fears, and revolving a thousand schemes to escape
from the dilemma he was in, paced up and down his cold room, 01
threw himself upon his couch, to rest not, for there was neither
rest nor sleep for him; or how Virginia reclined upon her snowy
pillow, dissolved in tears, thinking alas! of pleasant and sunny
days gone by?of dark and unhappy days to come, and connect -


ing both with the image of one who was to her the idol of a
childish dream, yet still a permanent and enchanting one. Gentle
sleep had fled from the eyes of both?but true to her daily duties,
Virginia, who acknowledged her father to be her first care, arose,
and waited upon him; but she found that he was incapable of action,
almost of speech, and with the surpassing care of a devoted
daughter she forgot her own sorrows in her attempts to lighten
those of her afflicted parent, being attended by her faithful Dorothy
in these painful hours.
We will now proceed to narrate, though but briefly, the nature of
the connexion between the outlaw Crawley and his singular
acquaintance St. Clair?it is a dark story; yet blame us not, fair
reader, if we lay open before you a scene, the counterpart of
which is actually passing in many an hideous drama, in this fair
world of ours. About fifteen years before the time of which we
speak, a schooner of large proportions, strongly built, and well
manned and armed, was often seen in the neigbourhood of the
island of Madagascar. She was supposed to be a pirate, but it was
only a supposition, as if ever she captured any unfortunate India-
man or other vessel, no living creature ever escaped to give
evidence against her; and she sailed the seas in perfect security
for a while, for the naval powers of Europe, at that period, had
their hands too full to allow them to attend to the depredations
committed at a distance from home. One day in summer, when
a light breeze swept over the face of the ocean; when the gently
rolling waves reflected on all sides the multiplied rays of a bright
sun; and when the snow-white clouds chased one another playfully
over the azure vault of heaven, a ship of moderate size was dis-
covered from the mast-head of this armed schooner. Orders
were immediately given by her commander, and her head turned
in pursuit. The crew hurried to and fro, and spoke in low whispers
to one another; preparations were made as if for a warlike attack,
and the devoted ship still continued her course, unsuspicious or
fearless of open danger or concealed treachery.


At length, when it was too late to fly, and perhaps hopeless to
resist, the real character of the schooner was discoved by the
officers of the unfortunate ship. An attempt was made to defend her
by a number of men rushing to the side, hastily armed with guns
and cutlasses ?but the pirates, of great numerical strength, and
well armed, and headed by their ferocious commander, and cheered
on by a young man of a villanous aspect but great muscular
power, leaped on board the ship, and commenced an indiscriminate
massacre of all who were opposed to them. Poor fellows ! they
soon fell before the numberless blows of the infuriated outlaws,
and the pirate chief struck down with his own hand a man, in the
prime of life, of good appearance, though armed only with a cane.
He had no sooner done so, than a wild scream rent the air, apd a
young female, with a beautiful little girl in her arms, rushed upon
the bloody deck?firearms were discharged?the female fell,
wounded in the breast, and while the crimson stream gushed
rapidly forth, she rose upon her knees, and uttered these terrific
words?
?Oh Richard! my long lost brother, is it thus I find you ??
The pirate captain, to whom these words were addressed, stood
for a moment, pale and awe stricken, and then fell senseless. The
second in command ordered the wounded lady and her child to be
conveyed back to the cabin of the now captured vessel, where
she soon breathed her last, having witnessed the death of her
husband by the hand of her brother.
When the pirate chief recovered from his swoon, he found the
eyes of his lieutenant fixed upon him with an enquiring glance.
Springing towards him, he said, in a paroxysm of despair ? Kill
me, shoot me, tear out my heart, Crawley, for I am a miserable
man.?
The lieutenant, however, took his commander by the arm and
led him to his berth. The daughter of the poor lady he also took
some care of. Assuming the command of the pirate vessel, he
ordered the prize, after all the articles of any use or value had been


removed, to be instantly burnt. The captain was incapable of
farther exertion, he bewailed incessantly over the portrait of his
dead sister and her orphan child, so that Crawley was glad to set
them on shore at a foreign port; after which, fearing that piracy
was too dangerous, he turned his attention to the slave trade, in
which he was tolerably successful. The captain, under the as-
sumed name of Dudley St. Clair, wandered about from place to
place, leaving his niece, Virginia, to the care of a lady who kept*
school near Dublin. Here Virginia became acquainted with the
Percivals. She always considered herself the daughter of St. Clair,
and the latter had not thought proper to undeceive her. The time
rolled on. St. Clair became tired of wandering, and at length took
up his residence, with Virginia, at the lonely mansion we have
described. Here he was sometimes visited by Crawley, who, work-
ing upon his fears of a public execution, managed to obtain a
dangerous influence over him.
Chapter IV.
Lieutenant Bradshaw, of the Coast Guard or Preventive Service,
occupied a cottage near the sea side, and close to the town which
I have already named. It was one hour past midnight, and
Lieutenant Bradshaw was in his bed-room?nay, he was in his
bed?but his candle was still burning on a chair beside him, and in
his mouth he held tightly the amber mouth-piece of a meershaum
pipe, of imposing dimensions. Lieutenant Bradshaw seemed to
enjoy the fleeting moments as he lay propped up by four or five
pillows, watching the blue curling wreaths of smoke as they
ascended, and lost themselves in the folds of the canopy above
his head. Of the thoughts which presented themselves to the
brain of Lieutenant Bradshaw at this particular hour, it is not
our purpose to speak; but he sometimes cast his eyes to the
window of his apartment, as if afraid it would be soon broken


into fragments by the ceaseless rain that dashed against it with
ruthless violence. At length he laid down his pipe, adjusted his
pillows for slumber, and was about to extinguish his candle with
the heel of his slipper, when he was thrown into a state of excite-
ment by a most unwelcome interruption.
? Who in the name of ten thousand furies can that be at this
time of night ?? asked Lieutenant Bradshaw of himself; ? some
scoundrel of a spy or informing villain, I suppose, to take me out
on duty such a night as this, ?may the foul fiend himself fly away
with you, my friend, whoever you are; or keep you there till you
become a porpoise or an alligator.?
This benevolent speech was scarcely finished, before the ringing
of the bell, and the knocking at the door, became so violent as to
threaten the demolition of the one, and the bursting in of the
other, in defiance of sundry locks, chains and bolts; and not
satisfied with the usual means of making his presence known, the
applicant for admission applied his heels so vigorously to the
lower part of the door, that the lieutenant, arousing himself from
his apathy, called out loudly to his serving man, who slept in a
shed adjoining his cottage, ? you Simpson, holloa Simpson see
what beastly cur is that at the door.?
Simpson, not a whit behind his master in grumbling, and
bestowing a hearty malediction on the disturber of his slumbers,
hastened to the door, and there, to his infinite astonishment,
beheld the benumbed and dripping form of his master?s friend,
Edward Percival.
? It?s Mr. Percival, sir,? shouted Simpson to his master.
?Is it, by St. Patrick!? roared the lieutenant, with a chuckle,
then it?s not a spy after all; show Mr. Percival into the parlour,
or tell him to come in here at once. Light a fire, and get some
hot brandy and water directly.?
Percival entered, and exhibited to the wondering eyes of the
officer, a very sad exterior indeed. A saturated handkerchief was
tied round his head, and his heavy coat was not only soaked with


rain, but it was covered with thick black mud from top to bottom.
Far from taking matters very sadly, however, he smiled as cheer-
fully as the remembrance of his visit to the Black Castle would
allow him, and proceeded to take off his clothes.
?Why, Percival,? said* the lieutenant, ? ?pon my life I?m glad
to see you ?an unexpected pleasure to both of us; ?sit down, my
boy; what fun have you been up to to-night ??let?s have the
story. Now, Simpson, you rascal, be quick with that brandy and
water.?
?Oh ! never mind me, Bradshaw,? said Percival; ? 111 tell you
the story at breakfast?where am I to sleep ??
?Well, if you have no objection, you can pop in here with me,
there?s plenty of room, and I don?t think I?ll kick you.?
?No objection in the world, so that?s settled. Now Simpson,
get these things dry for me by breakfast time, I must get home
early; but how to get home?can you lend me a horse, Brad-
shaw??
? Not having yet obtained a commission in the horse marines,?
answered the officer, ? I?m sorry to say, I can?t; but I?ll get you
one from old Bottlenose, below there, at the sign of the Seven
Cats and One and Twenty Fiddles. What in the name of all
that?s aquatic, possessed you to walk here such a night as this ??
? I walked here against my will,? answered Percival; ? Rodolph
and I parted company three hours ago.?
? Ha, ha!? laughed the lieutenant; ? never heard of such a thing
before; the idea is quite rich, ?pon my honor, as Rodolph and you
parting company. Simpson, draw that table to the fire, and bring
in everything you can muster for supper; ?where did it happen ??
?Well, that?s rather more than I can tell you,? replied his
visitor; ?it was somewhere up in the hills there; but, I suppose it
all amounts to this ?that he took one road, and I took another.?
The conversation of the two friends, until they found themselves
wrapt in the arms of Morpheus, was of too desultory a nature to
require repeating; but the next morning at breakfast, Percival,


considerably refreshed by a sound sleep and dry clothing, recounted
to the lieutenant his adventures of the preceding night, not omit-
ting his strong suspicions that some person, of perhaps lawless
character and pursuits, had visited St. Clair at the same time that
he, in perfect innocence, had paid his respects to his fair daughter.
?Well, that is good,? here broke in the lieutenant with a laugh;
? perfect innocence do you call it, to induce a girl to run away from
her father?s roof-; besides, ?tis a dangerous affair, as she is not of
age. So, my dear fellow, I recommend you to have a little
patience.?
?Ah! if you knew what a Turk of a father she has got, you
would pity her,? said Percival with a sigh.
?So I do pity her, from my soul; so much so, indeed, that I
heartily wish she was either in your quarters or mine; ? anti toe
light-hearted officer laughed aloud.
Percival colored, but immediately said, ? I am not afraid of your
interference, Bradshaw, but I should like to know if you have an
intelligent man in your guard, who can go up and screw a little
information out of the old couple at this Black Castle; I think we
should send a spy into the enemy?s camp, merely to ascertain
what the business of that lurking scoundrel may have been.
? Right, my boy, right,? said the lieutenant; ? 111 send one
instanter. And I?ll board that schooner in two hours, with a dozen
men; and if I don?t like the look of her, Mr. Crawley, or whatever
his cursed name is, won?t get away in a hurry.?
? And I,? said Percival, ? will just borrow, or hire, a nag some-
where, and ride home. If my worthy mother catches a sight of
Rodolph with the saddle under his belly, she?ll be buried in hys-
terics; but be sure, Bradshaw, if you hear any stirring news to
send me a special notice without delay.?
? You may trust to me, Ned,? said Bradshaw; so here goes
for the schooner.?
Edward, having procured a new hat and a horse, proceeded on
his road homewards; and the lieutenant summoned his men fox


duty. One of them, a short, strong man, who looked as if he had
spent a portion of his life in every quarter of the globe, he took on
one side and said a few words in his ear. The man went away
immediately. The others were directed to arm themselves, and
man the cutter, which lay in a little bay near the station. In a
short time all was ready, and they proceeded to sea, the officer
having whispered a few words to the man who remained at the
station. The weather, though the rain had ceased for some hours,
was by no means settled, for the heavy black clouds still floated
gloomily over the already drenched earth; the wind was moderate,
and an occasional glimpse of sunshine would sparkle over the sea,
or spread itself for a moment, like a carpet, on some green field or
distant hill. The boat sailed lightly over the waves, and it was
not long before the lieutenant descried the vessel he was in search
of. For a short time the schooner was hove too, as if in expecta-
tion of intelligence from the shore; but the vision of the prize, if
such she was likely to be, soon vanished from the eyes of the dis-
appointed men, as the vessel suddenly crowded all sail, put herself
before the wind, and quickly disappeared. The disconsolate officer
and his crew commenced their return, but their progress was re-
tarded by the wind and waves. A gun was fired as a signal from
the shore, and this, the lieutenant knew, summoned him on im-
portant business. He became dreadfully impatient, and was over-
heard by his coxwain to wish that the smuggler, as he suspected
him, might be blown into some friendly port, where he might be
soon comfortably hanged.
At three o?clock in the afternoon the boat touched the shore;
and as the officer walked out, he was met by a ragged urchin, who
handed to him a soiled piece of paper.
? What?s this ?? said the lieutenant.
? A letther, plaze yer honor,? replied the boy
? Who is it from ??
? Troth, its meself dosn?t know that same, sir; it was guv to me
by Jim Casey, and he says to me. Pettier, says he, run yer sowl


and give that to the wather poliss offisher, says he, and don t tell
him I sint you, says he, or ha the powers o? Moll Kelly I?ll kick
you from here to Ballinagrab.?
? Tell Jim Casey if he lays a hand on you, my lad, you re
such a clever fellow, that I?ll break every bone in his body, said
the lieutenant, opening the letter, which ran thus
?To Leftennajit Bradshaw? Sur, I make bould to be afther
tellin yer honor?s glory, that Paddy mulhalagan tould me that
Dermot doherty tould him that nancy Callaghan?s niece was up at
the black house an? that there?s a quarr concarn ther its no less
than the yung leddy is to be run away with an? that this very
night so be up there at 8 or before with some men and take the
blackgards an? this is no thrap but honor brite among thiei es like
yer honor and yer humble Sarvint to command
?Tim Lamplight.?
? This is something that concerns Percival,? said the lieutenant
to himself. ? Go, Williams,? he said to his coxwain, ? without a
moment?s delay; get a swift horse, and ride after Mr. Percival?
ride to his house, or to the d 1, so you only find him; tell him
there?s news from the hills, and he must be there with me by eight
o?clock; he?ll understand you?ride for your life.?
Having issued these orders, the officer betook himself to the
enjoyment of his meershaum, muttering to himself,? ? eight
o?clock?six miles?four men and self? pitch dark at seven?this
Ireland is an infernal hole ??&c., &c.
We will leave him to his meditations, and return to the beauti u
Virginia and her gloomy uncle, as we must now call him. She
had passed the whole day in attendance upon him, though er
mind was very sad, and her bright eyes red with frequent tears.
It was in vain that she tried to drive away her unhappy thoughts,
and lead her imagination to the hope of days of love and gaiety yet
to come. The visit of Edward Percival had acted like a me an-
choly charm, and she repeated often to herself the words, ?he


still thinks of me?he still loves me; ? words that did not fail to
make her heart beat quicker, and brighten the clear color of her
cheek. Thus the time passed, and night came on. She sat alone
in her little apartment, having left her supposed father to himself,
at his express desire, and occupied herself alternately with her
needle and a book.
No incident of importance had occurred throughout the day,
except that a weary pedlar, with a heavy pack, had called late in
the evening, and pleading the coming darkness, asked to be
allowed to remain all night, and his request was granted by the
old couple in the kitchen, who said nothing about it to their master.
A countryman, who seemed to be an old acquaintance of Dorothy
and her husband, had also dropped in to have a quiet chat by the
kitchen fire. It was remarked by Dorothy, who was particularly
sharp, that her acquaintance and the pedlar eyed one another with
distrustful and suspicious looks; and as she afterwards told her
mistress, from the way they conversed she was ? afeard of a
skrimmage the whole of the evening.?
St. Clair sat in his room as usual, having been throughout the
day, more unhappy than he generally was. The ill-omened visit
of his hated companion in former crimes, called them up in his
memory, if anything was necessary to do so, with tenfold distinct-
ness ; and he, now more than ever, inwardly cursed the day that first
witnessed his transgression of the laws of God and of his country.
His heart, though originally cold, selfish, and unfeeling, had had
time to soften. The unexpected and revolting murder of his
sister?s husband, so soon followed by the tragical death of his
sister herself, had the effect of crushing the natural ferocity of his
temper, and from that moment he determined to tear himself from
the lawless but exciting life on which he had entered. Willingly
too would he have abandoned all connexion with his companions
in crime, but Crawley was not so easily shaken off. He required
the assistance of his former commander, and by the influence he
obtained over him, could command him to almost any extent.


One absorbing idea bad taken possession of St. Clair?s mind. His
affection for Virginia grew to that extent, that it exceeded the love
of very many father?s for their children. His anxiety on her ac-
count was indescribable. If the sun shone too brightly, or the
wind blew too keenly, his first thought was for her, as of a delicate
flower; and the thought of a villain like Crawley obtaining pos-
session of this flower was madness.
The clock struck nine. The night was black, but no rain fell.
The countryman in the kitchen rose up as if preparing to depart,
when a noise was heard, as if some person or persons had entered
the house, and were groping their way in darkness. The country-
man turned at the sounds and faced the pedlar, who stood with an
excited glance; going up to him he whispered, ? are you a frind
or an inemy ? tell me, or by the holy St. Dominick ?
? A friend,? replied the pedlar; ? I?m here to save her if I can. ?
Just then a female voice of agonised distress was heard: the two
strangers, followed by the two old servants, rushed into the hall at
the same moment that St. Clair rushed from his room, saying
aloud, ? villain, you shall die !?
? Madman, your time is come,? said a voice, hoarse with pas-
sion ; ? had time served, you should have been hanged like a
dog.?
A heavy blow was struck, and St. Clair fell bathed in blood; but
Crawley, the murderer, was seized by a powerful hand and quickly
secured", notwithstanding his great strength. The triumphant
Irishman held him fast, while the pedlar flew to Virginia?s rescue :
he found her struggling faintly in the grasp of a huge ruffian a
moment more and Percival, followed by the lieutenant, burst in
with breathless haste.
?Too late, by Jove,? said the latter; " where are you,
Thompson ? ?
? Here, sir,? said the pedlar; ? and I?ve got a prize here whose
neck is ripe for the halter.?
? Hold him tight; ?how many are there ? ?


? Two, sir; and that honest countryman there, who I mistook
for one of the gang, has got one.?
? Well done, my lads,? said the officer; ? this is Jim Casey, I
presume; mind you, Jim, don?t kick that boy Peter.?
Virginia had fainted, but when she opened her eyes they rested
on her lover?s face; a profound sigh, and a flood of tears, relieved
her;?the sight of blood was kept from her, and she knew nothing
of the murder of her uncle until she was the guest of Edward?s
mother.
It only now remains to be told that on an official examination
of St. Clair?s house, a manuscript was found, containing the leading
incidents of his life, and an account of the parentage of his sup-
posed daughter. The black cloth was removed from the wall, and
the portrait of a beautiful woman was discovered. On the back
of this portrait was found written, in St. Clair?s handwriting?
? My unfortunate sister, Jan. 23, 1787- ?R. C.?
One year was allowed to elapse before Virginia and Edward
were united. We will not attempt to describe the rejoicings, the
balls, picnics, regattas, or fireworks; hut certain it is that Lieu-
tenant Bradshaw was rudely torn from the most splendid
jollification he was ever engaged in, by the appearance of a real
spy, upon whose unlucky head, not daring to disregard the infor-
mation, he heaped up all the blessings (?) of which his careless
nature was capable.
The outlaws had been disposed of less to their own satisfaction
than to that of other people, and the strange vessel, yclept the
? Flying Jenny,? commander Samuel Flounder, sailed away, and
was never more seen or heard of on the Wicklow coast.
Mortimer.


AT REST.
Upon a soft and silken couch,
A shadowy form she lies;
One wasted hand beneath her head.
And closed her dreamy eyes.
All costly and luxurious things
Are in that darkened room;
Rich flowers breathe forth their thousand scents ?
She recks not of their bloom!
And loving ones are tending her.
They smooth her pillow o?er;
They cannot do enough, they think ?
She knoweth them no more 1
There is a chill upon her brow.
That brow so fair and high ;
And round her pallid lips comprest
The trace of agony.
Hush! from beneath those heavy lids.
Large tears are slowly pressed;
And now ?a sigh, a sob, a gasp?
The weary one?s at rest!
At last, at last the broken flower
Has fallen, branch and leaf!
The heart has laid its burthen down
Of mingled love and grief.
I would not call her back again.
Her of the fair young brow; ?
In the far mansions of the blest
She walks, an angel now.
SILENZIO.


THE DEATH OP THE FIRST BORN
Before the monarch stood the man of God,
And in his hand he bore the wond?rous rod;
With lips that quivered not, and dauntless breast.
Proud Egypt?s awful doom he thus exprest; ?
? Thus saith the Lord, the God thou hast defied.
? I?ve heard thy threat?nings, and I know thy pride;
? Though hard thy heart, by proud rebellion steeled,
? Jehovah?s mighty arm. shall make thee yield.
? And those, my people, now by thee opprest.
? Shall be redeemed, and all their wrongs redrest.
? Nine times I?ve proved thee, yet thy stubborn heart
? Refuses to let Israel depart.
? I?ve shown the power of my Almighty hand,
? In thee, thy gods, thy servants, and thy land;
? And now, one more terrific plague I bring
? On Egypt?s people, and on Egypt?s king.
? Thus saith the Lord : thy most determined foe,
? Thro? Egypt about midnight will I go;
? I?ll lift my glitt?ring sword of vengeance high,
? And all the first-born of the land shall die;
? From the poor captive, in the dungeon prone,
? To the proud occupant of Egypt?s throne.?
Thus spake the seer, with holy anger fired.
And from the presence of the king retired.
The day rolled on,
The glorious sun.
Sank ?neath the western sky;
And crowned with flowers.
? The laughing hours,?
In noiseless speed swept by.


And night again.
With all her train,
Of dim and gloomy state,
On her black throne.
With stars thick sown
In sable splendour sate.
No dark gloomy clouds, by the hurricane driven,
Obscured for one moment the fair face of heaven;
No thunder-crash.
No lighting flash.
No trumpet blast,
No signal past,
Nor omen portentous, nor ?larum was given.
Calm as the bosom of their Nile,
Resting beneath the moonbeam?s smile,
The stream of life did onward glide;
Peaceful and mild, serenely still,
No thought nor care of future ill
Aroused the fears, or bowed their pride.
The hour drew near
Of midnight drear.
No sound was heard, no word was spoken;
There was not a jar,
Or ought that could mar
The silence that reigned, deep, full, and unbroken,
Save by the murmuring moan.
Of the nightly breeze alone,
As sighing it swept round the Pyramid s cone.
In the high court of heaven
To the Angel of death,
The dread mandate is given,
And with pestilent breath,
With dark vengeful frown,


And fierce fire-flashing eyes.
With flaming sword drawn.
Throughout Egypt he flies.
At the strength he mocks.
Of bolts and locks,
And he laughs at the gate by bars made fast.
Where its inmates in fancied security sleep.
Whilst their vigilant watch the sentries keep;
Yet he enters unseen.
Their ranks between,
Like the piercing breath of the desert blast.
He passes no house on his pestilent way,
Whether palace or cot.
It mattereth not,
He enters them all with commission to slay.
And the mother hung over her first-born child.
And her bosom was thrilled with transport wild.
As his cheeks she prest.
To her snow-white breast.
And her darling looked up in her face, and smiled.
Who can describe that mother?s joy,
As she gazes thus on her only boy;
But a sudden change o?erspreads his face!
Where erst was seen health?s rosy hue,
An ashy paleness now takes place.
And quiv?ring lips of livid blue.
Keen throes of anguish rack his frame.
Quenching life?s feeble flickering flame;
Ceases his fluttering heart to beat.
Death?s ruthless conquest is complete!
Ah! mother, thy tears and thy struggles are vain.
And fruitless all means thy dear babe to restore;
The face thou hast gazed on shall ne?er smile again.
And those eyes that entranced thee shall sparkle no more !


And another was roused by the piercing cry?
Of her only son in Death?s agony.
And in terror she rushed to the side of him,
But in time to witness the parting breath ;
The glazing eye, and the quiv?ring limb,
And the last convulsive struggle of death.
Hark! music and song float on the air,
Breaking the stillness of the night;
And see! where the blazing torches glare.
Borne by virgins arrayed in the purest white,
O?er the dull, darkened streets sheds a brilliant light,
With pipe, and timbrel, and dancing so gay ?
What means it ? this outbreak of gorgeous display ?
?Tis a bridegroom?s procession; in youthful pride
He is carried along to the house of his bride.?
And there in yon mansion, in splendid array,
Where the numerous torches out-rival the day,
Reclines on her couch the luxuriant fair.
With jewels adorned, decked with ornaments rare.
A diamond-lit girdle encircles her waist,
And a gem-broidered veil o?er her figure is cast;
Pale, pensive, and sad, little cares she just now.
For the jewels and rings, and the gem on her brow.
Alone and absorbed in her thoughts she is found,
Tho? kindred, and friends, and relations surround ;
O, how her heart beats, as the moment draws nigh.
And oft uncontrolled, will escape the deep sigh.
? He is coming,? she murmurs ? he?s near, very near,?
As the sound of his music falls sharp on her ear;
Opprest by her feelings, not long doth she wait.
Wide open the doors, and ent?ring in state,
Her lover, her bridegroom, all richly arrayed,
In manliness, beauty, and youth stands displayed.


Deeply anxious he rushes, the veil throws aside,
To catch for the first time, a glimpse of his bride :
What rapture is his! what exquisite delight!
As the bright blaze of beauty bursts full on his sight! ?
But ah! as he gazes, his eyes become dim.
Convulsed is his frame, and contracted each limb ;
Quenched at once, and for aye, are his fierce passions fires.
And he sinks at the feet of his bride, and expires !
On his bed of down the warrior rests.
And suspended on high.
In glittering panoply?
Are spears, and shields, and nodding crests,
Trophies of many a well-fought day,
Torn from his vanquished foes away.
Hark ! in the stillness of the night,
A cry of horror rises.
And a shriek which any mortal may fright,
The warrior surprises.
Yet void of fear
He grasps his spear.
And stalks in martial pride to where,
Issue those sounds of deep despair.
What sight is that which meets his eyes ?
There on his couch his first-born lies,
And in his features he descries.
Marks of intensest agoniels.
As if the soul had, ?ere it fled.
And left the body cold and dead.
Its parting pangs essayed to trace,
And stamped the struggle in his face;
All, all the warrior in him dies,
The father glistens in his eyes.
Awhile he looks with vacant stare,
The living picture of despair:


Falls from his trembling hand the spear,
And with a burst of anguish wild;
With slow and faltering steps draws near,
T embrace his loved, his first-born child !
In yon lone cot, where vapours damp,
Half extinguish the midnight lamp.
A widow on her couch reclines.
With feelings most intensely wrought,
A prey to melancholy thought.
To pensiveness her soul resigns.
Thinks of the husband of her youth.
Who loved with constancy and truth;
Of past endearments, and the smile
Which all their sorrows did beguile;
Then of the hour, that awful hour.
When Death with stern, resistless power,
Snatched him away while in the bloom
Of youth, and laid him in the tomb.
And on her pillow, trickling slow,
The scalding tears, profusely flow;
And is there then no solace left ?
Is she of every joy bereft ?
No?he has left behind him, one
Pledge of their love, an only son,
And as she looks on that loved face,
His auburn locks, his eyes of fire,
She sees, or fancies she can trace
The dear resemblance of his sire.
? Long may?st thou live,? she prays, my boy,
?Thy mother?s only source of joy;
? Long may?st thou live to cheer and bless,
?Thy widowed mother?s loneliness.?


Ah! vain the wish, and vain the prayer;
For as she strains him to her breast,
And on those cheeks, so passing fair.
The fond maternal kisses prest.
With sudden horror back she reels,
So cold, so icy cold he feels :
His eyes are raised, his lips just part,
One sigh is heaved, one parting breath;
Hushed are the beatings of his heart.
Frozen in the embrace of death.
But where is he, who, filled with pride.
The God of Israel had defied;
Who, list?ning to his sacred word.
In scorn replied, ? who is the Lord ??
And treated with contempt and shame,
The men through whom the message came.
Go to yon princely hall, and see
Him, whom ten thousand slaves obey,
A prey to sad anxiety.
Nor can he chase his fears away.
By past experience he knows
The sureness of predicted woes;
And that from heaven each message sent,
Will have its full accomplishment.
And oft he softly steals alone.
Where sleeps in robes of silk enrolled,
Under a canopy of gold.
The youthful heir of Egypt?s throne.?
The time draws nigh??tis come??tis gone,
Yet, undisturbed, he still sleeps on.
Now pride and unbelief commence.
To have their wanted influence;
And quivers on his lips the word
Of scorn and pride?? who is the Lord ??


Schemes of revenge begin to grow.
And frowns to gather on his brow ?
But from the gilded couch their came
A smothered, wailing sound of woe;
And the youth?s tender, feeble frame.
Is racked with many a dreadful throe.
Not long protracted is the strife.
The struggle between death and life;
One piercing shriek and all is o?er.
The hope of Egypt is no more.
And thus did the angel of death ride on.
With with?ring blight.
Thro? the gloom of night.
And thousands were slain ?ere his work was done.
The rich and the poor, the lord and the slave.
The prince and the peasant, the noble and brave;
Nor riches, nor honor, nor power could save
Their hopes, and the pride of their hearts, from the grave.
How great is the outcry! the wailing, how dread!
For no dwelling is found, where there is not one dead !
From the south to the north.
Dire confusion is springing;
Far away in the mountains
The echoes are ringing;
And shrieking, and yelling, in chorus are swelling.
From city to city, from hamlet and dwelling.
Thebes with her hundred gates.
Thro? which embattled states
Rushed to the war.
Joins in the general cry
With notes that rend the sky?
Heard from afar.


From every tower and pillared hall,
In Memphis? ancient capital.
The sounds of deep and bitter woe,
In one continued current flow.
And the cry reached the wand?ring Arab?s ear,
As he dozed in his tent on the sandy plain ;
And he suddenly started, and grasped his spear.
And listened, and wondered, and listened again.
And the eagle is scared from her midnight rest,
And screaming, she starts from her rock-built nest;
And the wolf, as far off in the mountains he prowls,
Is struck with affright, and in sympathy howls.
And in terror the owl and the bat seek the gloom
Of the dark caverned rock, and the mould?ring tomb.
From where the Nile glides.
By the reed-margined sides
Of Elephantina and Philoe,
To its farthest extreme.
Where the deified stream
Is met by the proud ocean?s billow.
One loud swell of grief?long, sad, and forlorn,
On the winds of the nocturnal breezes is borne.
?Till the mingled sounds of dire dismay.
Like informal minstrelsy,
? In hollow murmurs died away,?
Far over the distant sea.
But where was Israel, when this storm of wrath
O?er Egypt?s land in vengeance was poured forth ?
The cry of horror that assailed their ears.
Roused not their wonder, nor awaked their fears.
The dismal shrieks that filled the midnight air,
Proclaimed release from bondage and despair.


It spoke of fetters broken, foes subdued.
And their escape from galling servitude ;
And all those notes of woe, so sad and drear.
Where but as grateful music to their ear.
The lamb was slain, and every Hebrew?s door.
With its warm blood was freely sprinkled o?er;
And the destroying, an gel, when he cast
His baleful eyes upon it, o?er it past.
Protected thus by an almighty power,
Unmoved they stood in that disastrous hour;
And joy, by awe subdued, their hearts possess.
? The Lord fought for them, and they held their peace.?
So in that awful day, when Thou shalt come
To judge and deal to each his final doom;
When far away from Thee, and light, and heaven,
The wicked in his wickedness is driven;
When universal nature shall expire.
And earth and heaven dissolve in raging fire;
O ! may I stand secure as Israel stood,
Covered and sprinkled with a Saviour?s blood.
JUVENIS.


STUDENTS OP OLD TRINITY.
HARRY STANFIELD?S NARRATIVE.
(From a series of unpublished College Tales.)
W. Carr Boyd, A.8., T.C.D.
? Come along, Harry, my boy,? said Tom Hardy to me, one
evening, as he entered my rooms in old Botany Square, T.C.D.;
?I am sure we shall be late?are you quite ready to move ??
? Quite,? I replied, and in a few moments we had passed the
college gates. Not a word did either of us utter on the way,
although it was a considerable distance to B street. Tom
was, no doubt, busily employed in thinking over the bets he had
accepted upon the match he was to play that evening; and I was
too much filled with anxiety for my friend, to feel any desire for
conversation.
We walked, however, rapidly, and shortly found ourselves in
W ?s billiard room. The apartment was very large, and well-
nigh crowded with military officers and collegians, whom the
rumours of the coming match, and other causes, had brought
together.
To a gamester, the occasion was certainly interesting. Tom was
the crack billiard-player of Trinity College, and his antagonist,
Captain Roberts, of the B?th,8 ?th, was unequalled by any of the
garrison.
It would be needless to give a copious detail of the three games
played by the two champions. A bet of fifty pounds pended be-
tween them, and Tom had staked at least five hundred pounds in
several sums with others. Roberts won the first game with an
ease that made almost everyone present think it folly for Tom
to persist. But I knew him better; so, notwithstanding the
scarcely repressed sneers of his opponent, and the remonstrances


of the Trinitarians, I made Tom take a tumbler half-full of brandy,
and smoke a cigar before he commenced the next game. In fact, he
had been at a large party the previous night, and his hand was
unsteady, from want of rest and too much wine. The second
game commenced, and Tom made some points in rapid succession;
his opponent?s sneers became more rare, and our hopes more
elevated. It was a fine game, and Tom was successful.
In the interval between the second and third games, I induced
him to take more brandy, as the excitement had deadened the
effect of the former potion. Never did I behold, before or since,
such magnificent play as Tom made in the third game. He won
point after point, while his adversary scarcely made one. I closely
scrutinized Captain Roberts? features, and could not have imagined
that a man?s face could assume an appearance, so entirely different
from its ordinary expression, as his then assumed. He was a tall,
black-visaged person, of imposing aspect. Ordinarily he wore on
his face that calm, gentleman-like air of self-possession and ur-
banity, that so distinguishes the thorough aristocrat from the
mushroom. But now, while he was losing no, that was nt it
while his own sneers were thrown back on himself, his features
worked, and his eyes flashed with impatient fury. Tom continued
to strike, and was fast approaching a victorious termination to the
game, when he made a long pause, apparently undecided as to the
next stroke; by striking his adversary?s ball first, he was sure
scoring two points ; but by striking the red successfully he wou
at once win the game, This, however, was a manoeuvre that r
quired coolness and skill; and he seemed at length to have made i
his mind to the slow but surer style of play, as he prepared to sen
the ball against the white. At the moment of his taking aim, an
officer, who was standing behind him, turned round and said
Roberts, in a voice low, but audible, from the breathless silence
that had until then prevailed, ? I thought so; the infernal gyp
hasn?t the manliness to play boldly.?


? Did you speak of me, sir?? inquired Hardy, raising his head.
? I spoke to Captain Rabawts,? drawled the gentleman.
? Did you speak of me, sir?? exclaimed Hardy, his lips whiten-
ing with passion.
I thought it was high time to interfere, and, accordingly went
up to Tom and entreated him to finish the game, assuring him
that the affair would not stop there, but that I would see him
through it properly.
His excitement somewhat subsided, and with merely a remark
to Captain Wilkinson that he would speak to him presently, he
addressed himself to his task. To my grief I now saw that my
friend?s nerves were much shaken, and that his hands trembled
exceedingly. Notwithstanding this, had he persevered in his
former plan, I have little doubt of his success; but piqued by
Wilkinson?s rude speech, he aimed at the red ball and failed.
Roberts then made many points in succession. Tom?s play grew
worse and worse; and, finally, the former won the decisive game,
amid the smothered execrations of the collegians, and to the un-
disguised delight of the military spectators.
Although ? graviter commotus,? I had presence of mind to be
? serennus? (this is Virgil?s seeming paradox, not mine), and
presuming upon my powers of self possession, I advanced to
Captain Wilkinson, who happened to be standing alone, and
said, ? It is almost needless for me to remind you, that your
uncalled- for interference has been the cause of Mr. Hardy?s failure,
and therefore?
?Sir,? returned the officer, gazing on me with half shuteyes
and elevating his eyebrows, ? I don?t understand you.?
'?I repeat,? I said, ?that by your rude language Mr. Hardy
was so excited that he lost the game.?
? Well, sir,? he said, with an air of greater firmness than I had
anticipated, ?it is to Mr. Hardy I am answerable, I think; I
haven?t the pleasure of your acquaintance.?


This speech was accompanied with a look of such supercilious
scorn, that I was instantly deprived of self-command, and furiously
exclaimed ?
? Here then, sir, is ray card, and never was it given to so con-
temptible a puppy as Captain Wilkinson, of the 6 th.
What answer he would have given it is impossible to say, for at
that moment Tom burst forth from among, a knot of clamorous co -
legians, and stood before Wilkinson with a countenance distorted
with passion; at length, with vehemence of gesture and intona-
tion impossible to be described, he thus addressed him: ?So, you
swindling fellow! not content with being kicked out of the - ew
Market Club as a blackleg, you must endeavour to swindle Irish
gentlemen in their own city? Eh? Altho? you know the rule
that no one should speak during a game, you are mean enoug
do so, in order to save your friend?s purse, and your own too, no
doubt; but it will be no cheap bargain to you, that I promise ;
you?re a rascal, do you hear? You and your friend Roberts, are
a brace of swindlers!?
Let me assure my readers, not as an excuse for this most in e
perate language, but as a slight palliation, that Tom Hardy would
not have so expressed himself, but tor the brandy he had imbibed,
for he was naturally generous even in his warmth. He had en-
joyed, as I said above, but little rest the previous night, ana this
'ill prepared him (or strong potations and
His loud tones had by this time gathered around us all the com-
pany, soldiers and civilians, and almost before he had eonduded,
Captain Roberts had rushed forward, and pressed Captain ilk
son back. , . , -
?It is ray quarrel, Wilkinson,? he said; and in a much lower
tone, but overheard by me. he added. ? I never should be for-
given by my sister, tor bringing you into an affair of this k ,

said; he has called both of us swindlers.?
? l*2


Exactly, my dear fellow,? replied Roberts, ? both of us as you
say, therefore I am bound to deal with him; should I fail, and
he laughed savagely, you can succeed me.?
With these words he turned, advanced a step, and stood with
his face not twelve inches removed from that of his adversary.
Never shall I forget that picture; there they stood, tall, portly,
majestic, scowling in each other?s faces, the one with passion
working every feature; the other, with his countenance calm and
unperturbed, with the exception of his eyes, the expression of
which, altogether transcended aught I had ever seen, even in the
so called extravagant delineations of the French' artists. I could
almost fancy that his terrible anger, debarred from diffusing itself
through other features, through mien and gesture, had concen-
trated in intensely aggravated power, within the precincts of those
blazing eyes. But Hardy was not in such a frame of mind, as to
quail before fierce looks; he returned his new antagonist?s gaze
with interest, and after a pause, which seemed to our quickened
fancies fearfully long, he spoke in a voice hoarse with suppressed
rage, ? you are heedful of your friend, I perceive, but unnecessarily
so : it is not now that I intend to obtain the satisfaction I require.?
?This is but brawling,? replied Roberts, ?and it is disgraceful to
prolong it; you have insulted me as w-ell as Captain Wilkinson,
and I demand the priority in calling you to account.?
? By what right,? exclaimed Hardy, ?do you demand priority ?
Am I to incur the chance of falling by you, before I have had satis-
faction from the man who, in his insult to me, has injured my friends,
who staked largely upon me filled your pockets and his own,
with fraudulent gains, and seeks to ride rough-shod over men
better born than himself.?
I saw that Hardy?s impetuous rage was giving all the advantage
to his opponent, who still preserved a calm exterior.
?Tom,? said I, ?you must withdraw with me ; to-morrow you
will be better able to see your way in this unpleasant affair.?


? I shall not go, Harry,? he exclaimed, ? until 1 have taught
these scoundrels the consequences of swindling an Irish gentle-
man.?
Before one of us could interfere, he had clubbed his cue, and
struck Roberts a blow on the temple, which felled him to the
ground. This was the signal for one of the most desperate melees
I ever remember to have witnessed, even in those days of college
rioting. Wilkinson sprang forward, seized a billiard ball, and
aimed it full at Hardy?s head, which, as well as my own, it most
narrowly missed. It was a villanous and cowardly act, for had
the aim equalled the impetus, Tom had been killed on the spot.
My half-formed intention of neutrality, vanished at this outrage ;
the next instant I felt myself planting a blow at W ilkinson s nose,
and simultaneously experienced a misgiving, about the state of my
own. I cannot say which of the two was superior, for after a
good deal of severe hitting, we were suddenly crushed to the floor,
and severely trampled by a rush of combatants. I believe I was
deprived of sense for some time, for the first thing I remembered
after the trampling, was the sight of several persons, seated like
myself upon the floor, and laving or wiping their wounded faces.
I also saw some rapidly retreating by a back door.
?Where?s Tom?? I asked of one of the wounded.
?Made off,? said the party addressed; ? don?t you know the
? Charleys? are coming ??
? Why do you not provide for your own safety?? I asked.
? Oh ! if that were all I had to think of, I should be very easy,
said my friend; ? I have got a twist in my ankle, confound it, in
the scrimmage, and I can?t move a step for the life of me.?
At this moment Hardy entered the room.
? Why, Stanfield, you?re alive after all,? he said; ? I had brought
two fellows here to carry you; I thought you were regularly
floored. Quick man, be off, or we shall be picked up in no
time.?
L 3


? Don?t leave me, Harry, like a good fellow,? implored my dis-
abled friend; so with a little delay and some difficulty we got the
poor fellow away in safety.
The next morning saw me industriously knocking at the outer
door of Tom?s college rooms. Long did my foot play upon the
panels, before a pause in the boisterous mirth within, allowed the
subdued noise of the thumps to be heard through the double
oaken doors. When I entered, I found about a dozen of yester-
night?s heroes, smoking prodigiously, a tumbler before each man,
and a large square bottle of brandy in the centre of the table.
?Excuse me, gentlemen,? said Hardy, rising as I made my
appearance, ? I have some little business to transact with Harry,
I shall be with you presently.?
? Don?t move, Hardy,? said Fortesque, ?we must be off now;
success to you, old boy??and?? success to you,? was echoed by
the rest, as they left the apartment.?
?Now, Harry,? said Tom, taking a chair; ?we must be busy
for I have much to do, before I sleep to-night.? So saying, he?
handed me two notes, one from Roberts, the other from Wilkinson,
requesting the address of a friend, with whom they might arrange
matters in the usual form. Wilkinson had called on the part of
Roberts, and a Captain Lindsay on the part of Wilkinson; he had
referred them both to me, and now asked if I had seen them. I
answered in the affirmative. ? The only terms they spoke of,? I
continued, ? was an unqualified apology.?
?Of course you told them it was not to be thought?of.? ? I did
not; I said that Captain Wilkinson had given the first offence,
and I brought the affair so plainly before Lindsay?s eyes (he was
not in the billiard-room last night) that he candidly confessed his
principal was wrong. To Wilkinson I said, I would communicate
with you, respecting the insult to Captain Roberts. The singular
part of the circumstance is, that I myself expected a note from
Wilkinson, on his own behalf; but, I suppose he has deferred his
business with me for another day, lest by refusing to act as Roberts?


second, Roberts might suspect his intention of fighting and prevent
it; for I believe Wilkinson is engaged to his sister.?
?No doubt you have hit on the true reason: did you see Lindsay
again ??
No : I expect him to be with me in a quarter of an hour; but,
come now, Tom, you know you ought to send an apology to
Roberts.?
? Never, by heaven!? exclaimed Hardy; ?an apology to that
cheating ruffian ? I wonder you can name it.?
? I speak as one dear friend should speak to another. What
is the use of a friend if he'withhold the truth ? I tell you. Torn,
you are wrong, and what is worse, you know it too.?
? I was not wrong,? said Hardy with vehemence; ? you don?t
know that scoundrel, Harry; I have seen him frequently, and
observed his tricks.
? What if you have ? The world is wide enough for both of
you; apologize, and avoid him for the future.?
? I would die a thousand deaths first,? said Hardy.
?Tom, let me ask you,? I said, ?have you calculated the
consequences ? Have you thought of your widowed mother ?
Have you thought of Lucy? Gracious heaven! the bare idea
drives me mad! How should I tell her of your fate, if you
chance to fall ? In what words could I address her ? Could
she outlive the announcement, Tom ? or if so, would her
intellect survive the shock ? Madman that you are, can you
for a moment put the capricious and tyrannical forms of society
into the scale with the destruction of that amiable girl, with the
despairing groans of your devoted mother ?
? I thought of all this, Harry,? he said in a troubled voice;
?but if a man conform not to the usages of society, far better he
should be out of the world.?
? And so to conform to those usages, that is, by your own
words, to make yourself comfortable in the world, you arm a man
with a pistol to put you out of it. Am I to suppose that this


miserable stuff can impose on a mind like yours, Tom? Far
from it, the truth lies hid in a small compass?merely in the
melancholy fact that pride alone incites you to an act which your
native goodness of heart abhors, which your judgment denounces,
which your moral perceptions condemn.?
? Not so,? Harry, you wrong me: it has been always my opinion
that there are some cases in which duelling cannot be avoided.?
? I concede, for the sake of argument, dear Tom; but, is that
the question now ? I put it to you plainly, is your present position
one of those exceptional cases ? Have you not frequently said,
that duelling is only for those whose female friends have been
insulted and outraged in such a manner that the law is not avail-
able for punishment ? Observe now your inconsistency, excited
by brandy and defeat, you wantonly abuse a gentleman in the most
violent manner; no great principle is at stake, no lady in the case;
the affair takes place among our own companions merely, whose
heads were as unsteady as your own; could it be possible that one
human being in Trinity College will attribute your apology to
cowardice ? They know you better, Tom.?
? This is only an exparte statement, Harry; you lose sight of
our military friends altogether.?
? What do you care for them ? What have you in common
with them ? Shun their society at once.?
? By heaven, Harry, your anxiety deprives you of common sense.
Am I to avoid going to W ?s room to spend a pleasant hour,
through fear of meeting these scarlet puppies ? Am I to decline
invitations to dinner, because some of the B?th8 ?th are to be at table ?
I must fight, Harry, or lose my standing in society.?
? I see I cannot influence you, Tom; I shall act for you, there-
fore, solely because in other?s hands you might not fare so well;
but, a fearful cloud hangs over me; if ever man felt a presenitment
of evil, I feel it now.?
?My dear Harry,? said Tom, coming forward and clasping my
hand, ? do not be so troubled, things are not hopeless.?


I waved ray hand impatiently; he went on,
I swear to you, Harry, that the thought of of Lucy herself
does not afflict me so much as the distress which my conduct pro-
duces in the best, the truest, the kindest of friends; I solemnly
assure you that this affair over, I intend seriously to shun such
meetings for the future.?
?Why not now, dear Tom,? I said; ?you can avoid meeting
Roberts with a better grace than a business of the kind generally
admits of.?
? I cannot do so : your concern for me darkens your perception
of the matter; I see it in the proper light.?
Any further controversy was evidently hopeless, and I therefore
withdrew to my rooms, to receive Lindsay, who came at the
appointed time. He was a very young man, tall and slender, and
of polished manners, he seemed rather downcast; an evil augury,
and with anxious heart I invited him to be seated.
? I am truly sorry, sir,? said he, ?to have to state that my
principal does not coincide with me in opinion. I was about
to withdraw myself from this affair altogether I told him so when
he said he would apply to Major Huskisson, whose notoriety as a
duelist you can be no stranger to. I have consented to act still
for Captain Wilkinson, to prevent the interference of this man,
whom I much dislike, hoping that, even on the ground, our
mutual remonstrances may not be without effect.
? I certainly join you in that hope, Captain Lindsay and now
let us arrange the meeting: will five to-morrow do-in the fifteen
acres, of course ??
? Say six, if it be the same to you.?
?Well, I had a reason for wishing it five, but six will do.?
?You will have your own pistols??
?Probably; if not, we shall trouble you.?
? I suppose we had better settle the distance, what do you
suggest ??


?Twelve paces,? I answered, ?are better and safer than fifteen.?
? You are right ; but ten is the safest distance.?
? I am glad we understand each other, you wish like myself,
that at all events, no more than one exchange of shots shall take
place, and that both shall escape.?
? Such is certainly my wish,? I replied.
? Then I believe we have finished for the present: in the per-
formance of a disagreeable task like this, there is a pleasure in
doing business with one whose principles are such as yours.?
I bowed in acknowledgment to the compliment, and he departed
A more unpleasant interview was now before me, and I braced
myself up to assume a recklessness of manner, which was far from
being an exponent of my feelings. I drove off to the barracks of
the B?th, and found Captain Yvfilkinson reclining on a sofa
reading. I opened the colloquy without delay, by saying?
?My principal cannot think of apoligising; I have come, there-
fore, to arrange the preliminaries for a meeting.?
? What time and place do you appoint then ?? asked Wilkinson;
? you have the right, in the present instance, to fix both.?
I noticed a slight shade of anxiety in his manner; also, that he
had discarded the affected drawl in his utterance.
? I say half-past five to-morrow morning, in the fifteen acres;
distance ten paces.?
? Very good, sir, we shall be punctual.?
At this moment Captain Lindsay entered the apartment.
? What?s this, Wilkinson ?? he said; surely it was only decent
to leave the affair in my hands. I arranged everything with this
gentleman ten minutes ago. Besides, you know that it is not
etiquette for an adversary?s second to communicate in person with
the principal!?
? You are on the wrong scent, Lindsay,? replied Wilkinson;
? this is another matter altogether.?
? I beg pardon,? said Lindsay; ? I heard this gentleman say as
I'was entering, fifteen acres, distance ten paces.?


I had nothing further to detain me, so I left the room.
An hour afterwards Tom and I were driving rapidly out of town,
in the direction of his mother?s residence. It was a charming
cottage, situated about three miles from the city, with a lawn in
front, sloping down to the romantic Dodder, whose pebbly bed, in
summer, was almost undisturbed; but in the wintry months was
tossed by foaming, ang'ry, dark, and brawling waters. When we
entered the avenue and came in sight of the abode of his mother,
I stole a glance at Tom?s face; his eye was somewhat restless, but
no other trace of emotion was discernible. What repose, what
happiness seemed to beam from every portion of that dwelling.
How sweetly the monthly rose clustered around the windows, as if
eager to peep in upon the angelic beings within. Although I had
often visited the place before, yet the peculiar circumstances of the
last few hours made me feel with unusual force, the strength of
the contrast between the crowded city and, this delightful spot;
between the high, close-piled, and hot buildings, and the um-
brageous and lordly trees; between the monotonous hum of busy
multitudes, and the diversified trilling of the thrush and blackbird;
between the narrow streets, crowded with hustling citizens, and
the uninterrupted expanse of hill and dale; but above all, between
the strong passions daily aroused in the one, and the still serenity
engendered by the other.
These reflections lasted during our progress along the avenue,
and until we alighted at the porch. Tom had scarcely touched
the ground, when a still young and elegant woman rushed out and
clasped him in her arms. He kissed her again and again. ?How
beautiful you are to-day, dearest,? he said; ? this charming place
has made you young again, mother.? ?It is indeed a charming
place, Tom,? she replied, while a tinge of red stole over her cheek
as she saw me. ?lam so glad you are come with my son, as we
are now sure of his company for the entire day; I need not say I
rejoice to see you for your own sake also.?
? You are too kind, madam,? I returned, ? I feel assured,?


? Where has Lucy vanished, mother ? enquired Tom, out of the
window of the drawing room, whither he had rushed during his
mother?s speech.
? You will find her in the library,? she answered, and Tom?s
head disappeared.
We entered the drawing room, and Mrs. Hardy carefully closed
the door.
? Lucy is not very well to-day,? she began, after a short silence;
? s he is a very imaginative girl, and has been out of spirits for the
last few days, in consequence, as she says, of a strange presentiment
of evil, which she cannot dispel.?
I felt my color recede as she spoke, so strangely ominous did her
announcement appear in connection with my own misgivings.
Mrs. Hardy, fortunately, did not observe my agitation, and I had
time to recover presence of mind ?ere I replied
?It is but natural that a young imaginative girl, who loves as
Miss Ashburne does, should some times become a prey to gloom}
fancies. The bliss that is in store for her, in her union with one
so noble and gifted, is so perfect, so extatic, that it is no wondei
she doubts, at times, the reality of its approach, and this doubt is
a living death while it lasts.?
? I have spoken to Lucy in this strain,? replied Mrs. Hardy,
? but it availed not; and alas, alas, how often have forebodings like
hers been fulfilled.?
Tom and Lucy now entered the room; the former was in high
spirits, and after my usual interchange of greetings with Lucy, im-
mediately assailed me?
?If your nose disconcerts you, Harry, (for I see you are
blushing,) my mother is a capital hand at doctoring bruises.
He knocked his unfortunate feature, Lucy, stupidly against a
person in a crowd yesterday.?
Lucy shook her head and laughed.
Mrs, Hardy left the apartment.


? Ah ! you and Tom, I am afraid, have been engaged in some
naughty college freak, for he has a cut upon his cheek,? she said.
? Nay, I thought your opinion of Tom and me would prevent
such a terrible suspicion,? I replied.
The beautiful girl, whom her lover?s presence had divested of
all misgivings, looked up in his face archly, and then said, turning
to me?
? Tom, I believe, is the quietest student in college, is he not ??
? A very quiet person,? said I; ? and greatly respected by the
tutors in consequence.
? And your dear Harry, Tom,? said the merry girl, ?he is
equally quiet of course ??
? The gentlest fellow in the world, Lucy,? replied Tom; ? and
he and I are cut by all our class-fellows for our demureness.?
Lucy clapped her hands together, and made the room ring with
her silvery laugh. ? Who were the two foreign gentlemen, whose
faces were covered with black whiskers and moustache, and who
hardly knew a word of English, but who found their way to Sir
William Harrison?s in Merrion Square, on the night he was giving
a ball, cleared a passage through the domestics, and burst into the
ball-room in search of a wife, who had run away from one of the
two foreigners in Vienna. Poor men! How their lamentations
resounded through the house, when they did not find the lost one ?
I question though if in any country, save Ireland, compassion for
the stranger would have prevented an unceremonious expulsion
from the house, much less have prompted a host to act as Sir
William ; who, seconded by the company, succeeded in calming
the gentlemen?s grief, and made them stay until the ball was over.
Did you ever meet these foreigners, Tom ?
? I believe I heard of them,? said Tom.
? Indeed,? returned Lucy. ? I suppose you know equally little
of two very tall young ladies, who were running away from a cruel
parent, to escape a hateful marriage, and who, accidentally of
course, met a young collegian named Richard Brewster, allowed


him to escort them to an hotel, and to breathe vows to one of them
the whole evening, she, meanwhile, ungratefully concealing all her
features, save her roguish eye, with which she managed to do a
world of mischief? Was she not cruel to the generous youth, in
appointing an interview for the next morning, and vanishing for
ever immediately after his departure that night ? Think of his
feelings on going at the tryst hour, and finding?not the sisters, but
a -wicked little note on the mantle-piece, containing these mysterious
words? f Dick, you are sold!??Sold,? she repeated; ? what an
awful expression! It would do for a German student. The young
lady, no doubt, would be considered the arch fiend in disguise.?
? By Jove, Harry,? cried Tom, ?there is a spy in the camp.?
? Stay,? cried Lucy, ? I have not done yet. Who stuffed a
pocket handkerchief, and sewed it up, after inserting some horrid
chemicals, and then put it in boiling water until it jumped, placed it
on the lobby of the vice-provost?s stairs, and stood, apparently,
with awe-struck countenances, surveying its gambols, without, of
course, perceiving the learned dignitary, who was then ascending
to his room; who, in answer to his query ?? may the devil admire
me, what?s that ?? said, its a strange animal, sir, that we caught
in the park.?
? I don?t know how you gain all this information, Lucy,? said
Tom; ? but had you beheld that scene you would have enjoyed it.
The little scare-crow of a man bent down and glared at the jumping
handkerchief through his spectacles like a fiend ; he was coming
at last, too near it, when I sung out, ?he bites, sir, like a croco-
dile.? ? ?Do you see me now, young man ?? said the vice-provost,
hopping back; ? you don?t say so ? Are its teeth incisores and
canine ??
? Yes, sir!?
? Then it is genus carnivora ! I?ll just go for a book, and settle
its species. Don?t let it escape, young man ! And the crabbed
little fellow hobbled off to his rooms. Of course, when he returned
it had run away, and we were in hot pursuit.?


? What happened the next morning, Tom,? said I, ? was not the
worst.? Barrett, W. S., and two others were standing at a
table in the examination hall, not far from where I sat, and Barrett
was gesticulating violently, evidently trying to persuade his hearers
of some fact, while the redness of their faces, and the sudden
cough which seized them now and then, told of their efforts to
maintain their gravity. At length the Rev. Doctor exclaimed,
loud enough for me to hear ?
? The devil take you, W you will believe nothing.
? Don?t I tell you I saw it with my own eyes; it was cream-
colored, and striped like an armadillo, had short legs, and very
little hair, if any.?
? Why, Barrett, it was a guinea-pig, no doubt,? ? said L
? Say a rhinoceros at once, L ? exclaimed the exasperated
doctor: ? may the devil admire me, but you?re enough to drive
me mad.?
? Who shewed it to you ?? asked W
? What is that to the purpose,? said Barrett, sharply.
? Oh, nothing whatever,? replied W- , ? only I should like
to hear more about it.?
? Well,? squeaked the vice, ? Hardy and Stanfield were the
persons.?
The four burst into a roar of laughter. � Why on earth did you
not tell us so before, Barrett,? said W , after his mirth had
subsided, before you bored us with a description of this singular
beast ? And so you have actually traps set this morning m ic
park to catch one ?
?To be sure I have? responded the indignant nee-provost;
? and Hardy says he will watch them tor me;? and too angry or
further conversation, he ran away instanter.
How did the affair terminate ? inquired Lucy.
? Why, Tom and I were deprived somehow of our usual modesty
one morning, about three weeks after, and I am afraid impudence
got the better of ns, for, seeing Dr. Barrett talking with some
M i


of the seniors on the steps of the chapel, we went up and asked him
(Tom was spokesman) if he had yet found a name for the strange
animal ? The doctor grinned like a hyena upon us, and as soon
as passion permitted him to speak, he screamed out, ? W
do you hear this young scoundrel ? Do you mind me now, you
brace of Arcadians pcene gemelli nequituset nugis, you villanous
young reprobates, how dare you play me such a trick, eh? You
caught it in the park, you idle vagabonds ? It bit like a crocodile,
did it, you dogs ? It had dentes incisores and canine, you atrocious
young fabricators, had it ? May the devil admire me, but you
ought to he expelled before you have entirely corrupted the rest;
and do you see me, now, you had better be made up for Monday?s
examination : be off, you pair of impostors.? ?
? Very good,? said Lucy; ?these proceedings are highly charac-
teristic of the two most steady youths in the university.?
Luncheon was now announced; previous to partaking of which
I was compelled to undergo the process of having my enlarged
member bathed in a lotion prepared by Mrs. Hardy. Tom and
Lucy warmly applauded the operation. ? Every vestige of the
wound will be away,? said the latter, ? before the day you and
Tom go in for your degree.? She stopped and blushed, for the
week succeeding the degree examination was fixed upon as the
time of her nuptials.
?What ails you, dear?? enquired Mrs. Hardy of her son;
? you have turned as pale as death.?
It must be the reflection of the curtains, mother,? he answered
with a frightful attempt at a laugh, ? or ?or some other cause of
that kind.?
? You are not ill, my dear boy ? You would not conceal the
fact from me if you were.?
? I was never better in my life, mother,? he replied; ? gay and
hearty, hale and stout (he had by this time swallowed two or three
glasses of wine); how could Ibe otherwise, with such hopes before


me, with Lucy so soon to be mine ? Nay, mother, 1 m well, quite
well!?
The extraordinary vehemence with which he spoke, not a little
startled his mother and Lucy, the former of whom said, in calm
but anxious tones ?
? Tom, you are the only child that heaven was pleased to send
me. For many a long year you were the only earthly object that
engrossed my thoughts. It was by your features I discerned the
first developement of your intellect, by the same I traced its pro-
gressive powers. When in the careless freedom of childhood you
played around me, you could not guess that a mother?s anxious
eyes watched the workings of your countenance, until every
emotion, every wish was known to me, ?ere you had expressed it.
Think on this, my dear son, and then imagine, if you can, that I
do not now perceive the misery you strive to hide beneath your
present bearing.?
Lucy had quitted the room before Mrs. Hardy had done speaking.
? Mother, is any man at all times equally happy ?
? A wise providence has wisely chequered the lives of all, my
son, that by contrast happiness may be more strongly appreciated ;
but what, save joy, should enter your heart now. I can speak
unreservedly before Mr. Stanfield, whom I look on as a son, whom
you regard as a brother. A comfortable independence is assure
to you, this dear girl?s fate is soon to be linked to yours, her heart?s
best treasures are your own already; and Tom, you little know t e
strength of a devotion such as hers, but I am afraid you know still
less the method of deserving it.? ,
?What is your meaning, mother? Does it imply a doubt of
my affection for Lucy ?? ~
? No, my dear boy, I know you think your love is boundless.
? Think! mother.?
.. I said so. and you must understand me, Tom. Are you sure
that your love is not a mere affair of sentiment? Let me put the test.
Is her image always before you, inciting you to honorable efforts,
M 3


and thwarting foolish inclinations, or perhaps worse ? Are your
thoughts in the morning, these ? � what shall Ido to-day to please
Lucy ?? c Or, what would Lucy say, did she see me in these wild
supper-parties, whose termination is generally a disgraceful riot ??
? I shall not go to so-and-so?s to-night.? If you do feel thus, Tom,
then is your love not a sentiment, but a principle?an influence; ?
if you do not, then I say, and do not think lightly of your
mother?s words, your feelings towards Lucy will be a curse instead
of a blessing.?
? Mother,? said Tom, raising his head, which had fallen on his
hands, �� I have been gay, I admit, but not a roue. I have mixed
with wild companions, whose principles of honor were loose, but
there lives not a human being who has ever mentioned my name
in connexion with anything dishonorable or mean; and?nay, hear
me out?l am not deficient in that feeling you have just pour-
trayed. The thought of Lucy has often withdrawn me from the
threshold of error; often, too, has it sealed my lips against the
utterance of words that might have caused bloodshed.?
�� Why has it not always done so, Tom ? inquired his mother.
Her son gazed dubiously in her face and then in mine, as though
he was half persuaded I had told her all. I felt confused, partly
from his suspicion, and partly from the very unexpected pertinency
of her question.
�� My God! Harry,? he said at length, ? you cannot have been
so indiscreet ??
�� Stop, Tom,? said I, ?you are mistaken.?
? Mr. Stanfield,? said Mrs. Hardy, who had heard his speech,
and my reply, with wonder and alarm, ? you are my son?s dearest
friend. Yours is an educated mind, and must admit the responsi-
bility which attaches to that rare title, but which, too seldom, is
regarded among men at least. Your agitation and depression
have not been unobserved to-day. There is something seriously
wrong with Tom. This moment I perceive the struggle between
your sense of duty, and your dislike of annoying my son. I ask


you solemnly, does that sense of duty prompt you to disclose the
matter to me ? Would the disclosure be a benefit to your friend ??
The method in which she put this question was like a respite to
a condemned malefactor. Tom looked at me with much anxiety.
? Madam,? I replied, ? I assure you the disclosure would be no
benefit; however, I continued, assuming (God forgive me) an air
of indifference, ? we may as well make a clean breast at once ; or,
perhaps to-morrow will be better,? looking at lom. He under-
stood me in an instant, and said, ?Oh yes, Harry, let it be
to-morrow; we shall come out early and give you the whole
history, mother; I know you will laugh to think how small a trifle
can dash our spirits.?
? I have every confidence in you, Mr. Stanfield,? said Mrs.
Hardy; ? I believe you incapable of trifling with a mother?s
feelings, and your words have greatly relieved me.?
Curses upon my mean, low spirit, in thus deceiving that ex-
cellent woman! My eyes then beamed with the fire of youth, my
brow was smooth, my hair like the wing of the raven; age has now
quenched the fire, furrowed the brow, and blanched the hair, but
even yet, aye, as I pen these words, that deceit causes tears to roll
down my aged cheeks that ill beseem them.
We spent the rest of the day in varied conversation, until the
hour of our departure arrived. The countenances of all fell when
the servant announced that the phaeton was at tne door.
� Good bye, dearest mother,? I heard Tom say when I was
seated in the vehicle; ? Good bye, my own Lucy.?
? Don?t forget your promise to spend to-morrow with us, lom,
said his mother. ? Forget,? he returned, ? dear mother; is such an
appointment easily forgotten ? You know lam happy only when
here. And, Lucy, bye the bye, you must not indulge m the
fancies you spoke of awhile ago to me.
? When I see you to-morrow, dear Tom,? she replied, ? I shall
ose them all.?


? Yes, Lucy, but?but if Ibe an hour or two later than usual
in coming, you will not be alarmed, you understand.?
? What possibly can there be which will detain you ?? said his
mother.
? Tom, Tom,? I said, ? the horses are getting restive.? I saw
he was losing himself. ?In a moment, Harry:? ? nothing, dear
mother, nothing; only accidents ?you know?accidents may
happen. People must take these things into account; they must,
mother. My own darling Lucy, God help you I mean, God
bless you! Now, Harry, ray boy, lam ready.? He spoke in a
voice husky with agitation.
? Stay, Tom, for one instant,? said his mother; ?there?s some-
thing more dreadful under this than I had divined; may God
watch over you, my poor boy !? She burst into tears.
? O, mother, mother,? he exclaimed, ? what a wretch am I to
grieve you thus! Many a sorrowful hour I have caused you; at
this moment do I feel it most strongly. Oh that the past could
be recalled; that my many sins against you might be obliterated.
I have been a disobebient son, and have often wrung your heart.?
? Never until now,? she sobbed; ? never until now.?
? Grant me your forgiveness, mother, and your blessing, for my
conscience tells me I have need of both.?
? I forgive you, my dear dear son, and may the Almighty bless
you for ever! But stay, my dearest, you must not go?stay with
us only this night; go not into that fatal city; oh, fatal has it been
I fear to you!?
? Impossible, my own dear mother, I have much upon ray hands
which I must perform to night.?
There is far more upon your heart, Tom, and more upon mine.
Look upon that dear girl, see her drooping form, behold her pale
cheeks ?pale with her fears for you, Tom; if you leave her now, who
will comfort her ? Is it I, who, myself, am a prey to misery ?
Who will dispel the terrible illusions that of late have taunted


her ? Is it I, whom your last words have filled with the direst
forebodings.
? Gracious heaven !? exclaimed Tom, writhing with anguish,
? in what a hell of torture has my own folly involved me!?
? Beware,? said his mother, as though she had not heard his
exclamation, ? beware, I say, what you do ; one false step on your
part would crush her to the grave, as the hailstorm dashes the bird
upon the earth ; shame upon you, man! Your presence can raise
her heart to bliss, and you wantonly abandon her now to her
wretchedness! What motive is strong enough for this? Would
the universe tempt her so to act to you ? O, Tom, Tom, you are
unworthy of her!?
? Mother, farewell; Lucy, dearest Lucy, farewell! I can endure
this horror no longerso saying, he rushed out of the house,
sprung into the phaeton, seized the reins, and the next instant we
were whirled along with maddening velocity.
We interchanged not a word for a considerable time; at length
the horses stopped of their own accord at the foot of a hill, and he
then spoke.
? Harry, you heard it all, and are capable of judging ray
feelings ; by heaven ! a second scene like that would kill me ; as it
is, my senses are almost gone.?
? I can afford you no consolation, Tom,? said I; ?my mind is
totally overwhelmed as well with gloomy anticipations, as by the
sufferings of those we have left behind.?
? But why have gloomy anticipations, Harry ? I can unbosom
myself to you, and I tell you that death is most forbidding, as
it must be to every one in my position. Reflect, that very few
affairs of this kind terminate fatally. They are generally but a
form, a dangerous one certainly, but by no means murderous.?
? That depends, Tom, upon the temper and character of both
parties; besides, you have two antagonists to meet.
? Well, well, Harry,? was his reply, ? a few hours will put the
matter beyond calculation.?


No more was said until we reached his apartments in the college.
It was now night, so candles were lighted, the shutters were
closed, and we sat down before the fire.
? Tom,? said I, ?it is your duty to make arrangements against
unfortunate accidents. You should write some letters.?
? I intend to do so,? he replied; but lam not equal to the task
as yet.?
He leaned his elbow on the table, and reclined his head upon his
hand. A long silence ensued, broken only by the noise of the
thick rain-drops, beating against the windows.
? is a wild night, Tom,? said I. He did not answer, and I
bent across the table and looked in his face: he was sleeping
soundly; the extremity of wretchedness had acted as an opiate,
as criminals have been known to sleep upon the rack. I suffered
him to repose thus for about three hours, and then awoke him
by a violent shake.
? Is he killed ?? he asked in a terrible voice.
? Rouse yourself, Tom,? said I; ? you have much to do.?
? Presently, Harry, I have been asleep I perceive, I thank God
from my heart.?
? What, you have been dreaming then ??
? Oh yes, but now I must to business.?
He commenced writing his letters, of which he finished three?
one was addressed to his mother, the second to Lucy, and the
third to one he would not name. He made me promise to deliver
the first two personally. He next wrote several memoranda, which
he sealed, and then looking at his watch, said it was time to be
moving.
?We must go,? said he, ?to D ?s, where my horses are at
livery, and it will take some time to get under weigh.?
He took his cloak and hat, put a pistol case under his arm, and
moved towards the door. As we were going out of the room, he
threw his eyes around it, unperceived as he thought by me, and
seemed to take in every object within its walls ; they rested finally


upon the letters which lay upon the table, and then I saw his lips
quiver, and a shudder steal over him. We passed out into old
Botany Square, now still as the grave, and this too he surveyed
with the same sad and silent gaze. We were soon on our way to
the Park.
? Tom,? said I, ? we should have a surgeon with us.?
? Well thought of, Harry,? he replied; ?we were almost too late
about it, but luckily we shall in a minute pass the house of C ,
and I shall knock him up.?
Accordingly we sent up our cards by the lazy servant, who came
to the door on the third ringing of the night bell, and I desired
him to request his master to follow us in all haste to the fifteen
acres. We reached the appointed spot at length, and had not
long to wait for Tom?s antagonists, who were on the ground
precisely at half-past five. They raised their hats, and we returned
the salute; I then walked over to Wilkinson, and said, ? You
have brought no surgeon I perceive, we expect one in a few minutes;
have you any objection to wait so long ??
?We can at all events,? he replied, ?have our men ready.
?Is your principal still desirous,? I asked, ?that this matter
should not be amicably arranged ??
? If you mean to ask,? returned Wilkinson, ? will anything short
of a written apology satisfy Captain Roberts, I answer decidedly.
No.?
? Well, we may now toss for the choice of ground.?
He threw 'up a shilling and won. The position he chose for
Tom was very unfavorable : his form would be in broad relief
against the sky, while Roberts would be much lower, and more
shadowed. I remonstrated, but in vain. The accursed laws of
duelling were in his favor, and he was determined to avail himself
of the advantages they allowed. Tom meanwhile was walking
calmly up and down, without a trace of care upon his features.
The presence of his adversaries had called up all the man in him,
and his air seemed more akin to gaiety than to the opposite feeling.


About twenty yards off stood Roberts, smoking a cigar, and
patting his boot with a riding whip?we did not long remain in
expectation of our friend C , who was soon descried urging his
over-fed steed into a nondescript kind of canter. The worthy
fellow soon came up, and after warmly shaking hands, said.
? I need not ask who are the principals, for I see already, and
am truly sorry for one, at least.?
? I believe we can now proceed,? said Wilkinson; ? have you
brought pistols ??
I replied in the affirmative.
? I suppose in that case, each will make use of his own ?? he
next asked.
? Perhaps it will be best so,? I replied.
We then loaded the weapons in each other?s view, and I placed
Tom in the spot which Wilkinson had marked out for him, and
stepped out ten paces ?Wilkinson posted his friend at that dis-
tance. I went up to Tom, and handed him a pistol. ? Good bye,
Harry,? he said, smiling.
? God bless you, Tom,? I whispered, and withdrew to the front
with Wilkinson.
? Gentlemen, you will raise your pistols and fire at the word
� three,? ? said Wilkinson. ? One?two? three'?? Roberts fired on
the instant, but Tom did not raise his arm; I ran to him and asked
if all was right.
? Safe, Harry, for so farand so saying, he raised the pistol and
fired in the air. I went over to Wilkinson and said, ?of course,
Sir, your friend is now satisfied.?
? Certainly he must be,? he replied, ? according to all perce-
dents.?
?Now touching your own affair,? said I; until Captain Lindsay
arrives, we can do nothing.?
? It is possible,? he replied, ? Roberts, I think I shall have to avail
myself of your services in turn.?


I had turned, and was walking over to Tom ; but the stillness
of the morning enabled me to hear their conversation.
? What do you mean, Wilkinson,? inquired Roberts.
? Why, simply this, I too made an appointment this morning
with your antagonist, and as I thought you would be surly, I
employed Lindsay to make arrangements, but he won?t he here for
a quarter of an hour or so, and so you will act in his stead.
?You shall not fight,? exclaimed Roberts; it is my quarrel, and
mine it must be.?
?Come now, Roberts,? returned the other, ?this is very absurd.
If you will not act as my friend, say so; but neither you nor any
man will prevent me from fighting.?
? Is that your determination,? said Roberts fiercely.
?It is.?
? Then by Heaven,? shouted Roberts, ? I have not done yet!
Hark you, Sir, he good enough to place your friend on the ground
again; you seem to be in a hurry to get him off it.?
? I don?t understand you,? said I; ? your friend is the proper
person to transmit your wishes to me, or my principal; but, as
you have spoken, explain yourself.?
? Let me speak, Wilkinson, will you?? exclaimed Roberts, furi-
ously. ? I say, Sir, I have not got satisfaction, and that you and
your friend are in a great hurry to leave the ground.?
? There is but one way of understanding that, and one way of
meeting it,? I said, snatching a loaded pistol from Wilkinson?L
had Tom?s second weapon in my other hand. Stand off, Tom, do
not approach me, or by the God above us were you a thousand
times my brother, I will shoot you on the spot; stand aside, you
Sir, from that ruffian, and let him eat his lying words.?
So terrific I have no doubt was my aspect, maddened as I was
by fury, that Wilkinson recoiled, I might almost say, in affright.
I extended a pistol to Roberts, who instantly grasped it. ? Take
hold of that, sir,? I exclaimed, throwing the end of a pocket-hand-
kerchief to Roberts, and retaining the other end in my left hand.


He hesitated. ? Take hold of that, sir,? I repeated, stamping my
foot with rage, ?or I shall spit upon you.? He seized the hand-
kerchief. ? One ?two ?three? ?I shouted, and the lock flew off
my pistol, struck by the ball from his.
All this occurred in far less time than it takes me to describe it.
Tom now forcibly led me from the spot, and ere my pas-
sionate excitement had entirely subsided, Captain Lindsay arrived.
? Has the first affair gone off ?? he enquired.
? I cannot answer you,? I replied; ?the circumstances are rather
uncommon;? and I then told him of the conduct of Roberts.
?I could hardly have imagined this of Roberts,? rejoined
Lindsay;? he was a regular umpire in all difficult points of duelling
when he was in the 68th. I must say he has acted most strangely
on the present occasion.?
? I beg pardon,? said Tom, ? you mentioned the 68th just now.?
?That is the corps I belong to,? returned Lindsay.
? There was an officer in that regiment about six years ago,?
said Tom, ? who was noted as a duellist, and who changed his name
soon after, in consequence of his falling into a property somewhere
in England. Do you know the name he assumed ??
? Roberts is probably the man you allude to,? replied Lindsay;
? his name was Dennyson in the 68th.?
The change that passed over Tom?s face was appalling. He
gasped for breath, and caught me by the arm.
?In the name of God, Tom,? I exclaimed, ?what is it?? He
did not answer, but hurried me with rapid strides up and down
the field. At last he stopped abruptly, and turned short round
with his face opposite to mine.
? Look at me, Harry,? said he, ? I am cool enough now, am I
not ??
Cool enough he certainly seemed, but his face was that of a
corpse, and I told him so.
?So it should be, Harry,? was his reply, ?it is best fitted for
the grave work I have now to do?you don?t enjoy my pun, man.?


? Cease this unnatural trifling, Tom, and tell me what moves you
thus.?
? Come along with me and you shall know it,? he said; at the
same time moving in the direction of Roberts and Wilkinson, who
stopped in their walk as they saw us approach.
? Roberts,? said Tom, in a deep thrilling voice, ? I came into
this field to give you satisfaction for an injury, for which I could
not bring myself to apologize, but which my better feelings could
not altogether justify. You were about to escape; I did not from
the first intend to fire upon you, but the hand of Providence has
shown itself at the proper moment. It is but this instant I learn
that you are the murderer of the dearest friend I had in the world,
next to those who gave me birth.?
?He is mad, Wilkinson,? said Roberts; ?you need not hold my
arm.?
Tom smiled bitterly.
?The truth of my words,? he said, ?is written upon your livid
cheek, it flashes from your restless eye, it strives to break forth
from your heaving chest.?
?You wish as I do,? said Roberts, interrupting him, ?that our
meeting shall not end here ; let us return to our places, and settle
it at once.?
?Not till you have heard all,? replied Tom. Wilkinson and
myself listened in amazement. Tom went on, ?You met an Eng-
lish gentleman in Flanders, named Barclay;? Roberts winced at
the name; ?you decoyed him into hells and plundered him.
When it was too late, he received indirect information that you
had had recourse to dishonest practices, among others that you had
employed loaded dice in playing with him. He was indiscreet in
mentioning the matter to a friend, before he had collected full proofs;
it was brought to your ears, you challenged your victim, you fired
before the word was given, and he fell dead on the spot. This
double victim was my mother?s only brother and protector.?


? It was an accident,? exclaimed Roberts, in an hollow voice,
? the 68th knew me too well to think otherwise.?
? They knew too well your character as a duellist, to pretend to
think otherwise,? replied Tom; ? I was a boy then,? he continued,
? and the gloom of my home after that sad event impressed me
deeply. I longed for manhood, that I might pursue my uncle s
murderer; but time, and the Christian exhortations of the one most
injured had deadened my desire for vengeance. But from the first
moment I beheld you in W ?s billiard-room, I experienced
a feeling towards you different to what I had ever felt to man. I
hated you, I knew not why; but the instinct of the heart is never
wrong. Roberts, the grave is open for one or both of us.?
He waited not for a reply, but immediately withdrew to the spot
on which I had first placed him. Roberts followed his example,
and Wilkinson, Lindsay (who had heard the greater part of Tom s
speech), and myself, were left together. I felt it would be childish
to attempt to change Tom?s purpose, nor knew I how to set about
it. Wilkinson soon asked me to load my friend?s pistols, I did so;
and in going to give them to Tom, I stole a glance at Roberts.
He was deadly pale, but his desperate determination was evidenced
by the diabolic eagerness with which his eyes were surveying
Tom?s person, in order to be sure of his aim. 1 om, said I,
? there is no help for it, you must bring him down this time.
Don?t hold your pistol so near the butt, grasp it close to the lock,
you can command it better by doing so.?
We interchanged another farewell, and walked away.
?Are you ready, gentlemen ?? said Wilkinson.
? Yes,? they both replied.
? One ?two ? three !?
The reports rang sharply, and I was about to rush forward, when
the pistol fell from Tom?s hand, and his noble form rocked like a
vessel?s tall mast, he reeled twice, and fell slowly as a reluctant
pine beneath the woodman?s stroke. Wild with horror, I shouted
for the surgeon, who ran up and turned him on his back; a gush


of blood burst from his mouth. We all stood around awaiting
his announcement.
?He is shot through the lungs,? he said, deeply affected; ?he
cannot last five minutes.?
? Roberts, be off,? exclaimed Lindsay, and Wilkinson also, you
can do no good here, provide for your own safety,?
?Tom, Tom,? I cried, ?speak to me one word, but one word.?
He raised his drooping eyes to mine; I knelt beside him, and
took his hand, he tried to speak, but his efforts failed.
?Oh mercy, mercy, Doctor!? I exclaimed, ?is there no hope?
must he die thus ??
C. took off his spectacles, which his tears had rendered useless;
but he replied not, and his silence chilled me ?a deadly sickness
came over me, and my brain reeled.
?There is a carriage coming rapidly in this direction,? said
Lindsay. ? Keep off,? I screamed; ? I know too well who is
coming. Father of Mercies ! what is to be done ??
Hardly were the last words uttered, when the carriage stopped,
and two ladies alighted; they flew towards us; I was stunned,
petrified with intensity of agony.
?Too late, too late!? exclaimed the first. ?Alas !my wretched,
my unhappy son!?
Just then arose upon the morning air, a shriek, so wild and
thrilling, that every muscle of my frame started as though by an
electric shock. It proceeded from Lucy, when she saw her dying
lover. The film of death was scared by it a moment from his
eyes, and then closed over them for ever. When I knew that his
pangs were over, I turned to look at Lucy, she had sunk on the
ground, the Doctor hastened to her; by his order she was conveyed
to the carriage, and Mrs. Hardy also, who was led off as passive
as an infant, her sensations evidently paralyzed.
My narrative is nearly ended. Tom was buried in the vault of
his fathers. Lucy survived him but a twelvemonth. I never saw
his mother again. I forwarded the two letters Tom had written


to her and Lucy. Mrs. Hardy died not many years since, regretted
by all around her, to whom she was endeared by her sweetness of
temper and her active Christian virtues. Roberts was tried in
Dublin, but duels were then too common to excite popular indig-
nation. He was acquitted, as by the doctor?s evidence it appeared
that Tom had been most bent on the continuance of the combat.
This acquittal, of course, caused Wilkinson?s prosecution and mine
to drop.
The third letter which Tom had written the night before his
death, I found to be addressed to myself. I intended to transcribe
it for the reader; but it is so personal, and breathes so strongly of
affection to his old friend, that the effort would cost me much, and
perchance the fine feeling pervading it would, after all, be unappre-
ciated by the general reader.
THE FEATHERED FAMILIES.
A Fable.
Sometime ago, an old hen sat
With neighbourlike approximation
Upon a nest, adjoining that
Where mother duck held occupation :
So they agreed, by friendly chat,
To pass the time of incubation.
Their learning differ?d much, for quack
Was all the beak?d one?s education;
But Mrs. Roundbill spoke in cluck.
Which needed further explanation,
However, they had got the knack
Of simplifying by translation.


The time of hatching came at last,
When ten fine chickens joined creation;
And quite as many ducklings cast
Their shells, to show their fine formation :
So their confinement being past.
They all strolled forth for recreation.
On worms .and seeds the parties fed,
Just as it pleased their inclination;
And sometimes oats, or broken bread.
Were thrown to them, as extra ration:
Such comfortable lives they led.
Considering their situation.
When standing near a pond one day,
The mothers made a declaration,
In which they pointed out the way
Of safety, for the information
For all their little ones, that they
Might know the duties of their station.
The ducklings were informed, they could
At once commence the operation,
Of dabbling in the dykes, and mud.
And learn their art of navigation:
By which they might, when they thought good.
Dive down below on speculation.
As to the chickens, none should think
(Who valued life and preservation),
To venture further than the brink,
Under any consideration;
But they might freely go and drink.
Within the line of demarcation.


And these were made to understand
They had a different vocation;
To root, and pick on dunghills,?and
Take pleasure by perambulation
On any part of solid land.
Within the bounds of moderation.
The sun was shining, warm and bright,
And all seemed filled with animation.
At such a prospect of delight
And personal gratification;
For chirps and quacks, from left to right.
Burst from the feathered congregation.
Dame duck, to water took the lead,
And all the young who bore relation
To her, by nature, shape, and breed,
Soon followed without hesitation;
And many useful tricks, indeed,
She showed to them for imitation.
A little chick, that loitered by.
Beheld the scene with admiration ;
And could not keep from wondTing, why
Her mother in her dissertation.
Could be so cruel, to deny
Such pleasure, without provocation.
The ducklings liked their pastime well.
And gave this chick an invitation
To join them, ?whereupon she fell
Into a train of meditation;
Scarce knowing whether to repel,
Or yield to their solicitation.


At length, I?ve weighed it well, said she,
By just and calm consideration;
Yet, after all, I cannot see
The slightest cause for separation ;
Therefore consider it to be
Unjustifiable privation.
Have I not-got both sense and eyes.
For watchfulness and penetration;
And legs, and wings, to exercise,
In cases of necesitation;
With feathers, aye, and down likewise.
To buoy me with facilitation.
Supposing I should he so bold,
To break for once the regulation,
And with these little ducklings hold
Unlimited association;
I think that mother would not scold,
For such a simple violation.
However, be it right, or wrong,
I?ll prove the thing by demonstration;
And saying so, she dash?d among
The ducklings, but to her vexation
Found that she could not get along
According to her calculation.
The feathers she had prized before,
Grew burdensome by saturation ;
In vain she tried her wings, to soar,
Then struggled on with desperation
To reach, if possible, the shore,
And save herself from suffocation.


But all in vain, for tho? she cried,
In mournful chirps of lamentation,
No duck, nor ducklings, ever tried
To save her from such situation;
So that imprudent chicken died,
Died through her insohordination.
The Moral.
Incautious youth should ever take
Parental council for its guide;
And unreserv?d compliance make,
With what is granted or denied;
For when by judgment immature.
Our erring footsteps turn aside?
Disasters, great or small, are sure
Eventually to betide:
And when the evils we endure,
Of disobedience and pride ;
The very objects which allure.
At our calamities deride.
