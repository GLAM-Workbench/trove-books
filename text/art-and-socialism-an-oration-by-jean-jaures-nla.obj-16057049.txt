Art and Socialism.
The following Oration was delivered by Jean James, one of the leading
Socialists of France, to a conference of literary men and artists, organized
Friday, 13th April, 1900, at the Porte St. Martin, by the ? Theatre Civiqne ?
and the ?Petite Republique," under the presidency of Anatole France, a
distinguished savant. It is translated into English by Helene Campbell, and
published by the International Socialist Club, 74 York-street, Sydney, N.S.W.,
for the enlightenment of society.
Citizens^ ?
Allow me in the first place to thank Anatole France, both
in your own name and mine. It is a great joy for all of us :
it gives great hope to see him bring his wonderful mind to
bear upon the noble ideas for which you are struggling.
They are indeed mere superficial critics those who do
not recognize the positive efficacy of his work, forgetting as
they do that the characteristics of light are the source and
first cause of fertility. (Long continued applause ; prolonged
cries of ? Long live Anatole France.?)
I have been asked by some young persons, literary men
and artists, to tell you this evening what (in our Socialistic
conception) the idea of Art represents. I gladly comply with
their summons, and I begin a discussion with them in the
hope that, if not to-day perhaps a little later on, they will
answer me. They are attracted towards a militant life, to
seek there a new principle, a new power of beauty. They
have seen from a recent drama which his disturbed the
human conscience that the conflict of the social forces', the
conflict between right and wrong, between truth and false-
hood, has given birth in the souls of men to emotions so
strong, so full, so powerful, that, compared with them, all
others appear commonplace and futile; and it is from the


renewed life that they wish to demand a revivifying of Art
and of beauty itself. This first awakening of conscience has
given rise to such noble emotions that they have felt that,
with a complete renewal, with a complete transformation of
society in the direction of justice, new forms of Art would be
evolved.
They have not asked themselves, nor do they ask me to
say, in what form, in what measure, by what means, artists
will be remunerated in the Socialistic order which we wish to
establish. This does not concern them ; in the first place
because they are at the happy age when the burdens of
material wants and social habits do not yet weigh on their
lives ; and also because they have seen that, through succes-
sive changes of society, Art has always been able to make a
place for itself. They know that when society attaches to the
idea of beauty the price which ought to be placed upon it?
that is to say the very highest price?it always finds the
means of assuring very large elements of work and of means
of living to the workers of the beautiful, who have become the
brothers and the friends of the other workers.
Thus they see in the future a more harmonious and
beautiful form of society, and they can say, like Beethoven,
? We feel greater things towering aloft in front of us.?
They are not dismayed at the prospect that works of
Art, ceasing to be the individual property of a few privileged
amateurs, will become the collective common property of all
admitted to contemplate and admire them. They are not
afraid of it, because works of beauty are, from their very
nature, the property of the community, held in common. A
chef-d'oeuvre is belittled by being possessed only by a few.
Like a mirror continually reflecting only the same face and
reproducing its wrinkles as it recurs with obstinate impor-
tunity, the chef-d'oeuvre loses its status by being admired only
by a few. The human masterpiece wants the whole of
humanity to mirror in it its changing soull (Applause.)
For myself I do not know any emotion more beautiful, more
grand, more august and sacred, than that which fills one?s
soul at certain times in the great art galleries where the
works of the great masters are gathered together for all of us.
Recall to yourselves the close of the day, and those flitting
moments preceding your dismissal by the barbarous caretaker
the emotions which fill the mind in the presence of


those assembled masterpieces offered to the admiration of all
men. One would think it an Olympus, where the gods alone
have filled the sacred space with their dreams. Yes, the
beauty there is created for all, and I do not fear that those
who dream of glory will be afraid of Communism, for glory is
supreme Communism. It is supreme Communism, inasmuch
as it implies that the artist, the creator, emerging from the
narrow and wretched limits of individuality, has been able to
give to his work an impersonal and eternal value. It is Com-
munism, for through its means the whole of humanity
appropriates the greatest riches of the human mind; and
because in each generation the minds that pass away derive
from it a new sense, a new force, and a new joy in the eternal
work, immutable and ever renewed. (Loud applause.)
Bo that artists cannot be afraid of us ; and it is to liberal
minds open to the light of to-morrow that I state this problem.
We are clearly in the period which divides the end of the
middle-class democracy from the advent of social democracy.
We are in the terminal period of middle-class democracy, in
the initial period of social democracy. We may therefore take
a bird?s-eye view of the work of Art, which the development
of middle-class democracy for more than a century has
bequeathed to us.
I do not maintain, mark you, that the creative fertility
of what I call middle-class democracy, which was the outcome
of the philosophy of the 18th century and of the Revolution
of ?B9, I do not suggest that this creative fertility is altogether
exhausted. New masterpieces may come into existence before
the Socialist era is positively initiated. You know how, at
the end of a summer day, when the clouds become lighted up
by the setting sun, and all at once grow dull, we imagine that
this supreme illumination is ended. Yet suddenly another
cloud top is touched with light and bursts into flame. The
horizon has been so charged with light during the long
summer day, that it cannot, so to speak, exhale the sunlight
it has received, and the sun, although he has disappeared,
sends to the horizon, which he has just left, from far off his
glorious message of good-bye. It may be that the revolution
of the middle classes still continues to illuminate the works of
men, even at the hour when the dawn of a new revolution is
breaking. (Prolonged applause),


I do not pretend either to be able to sum up in the dry
brevity of a formula the work of creation and of beauty, which
was accomplished a hundred and twenty years ago, inspired
by the revolutionary mind of the middle classes. Using the
illustration I employed just now, I say that, in the same way
that every minute of a summer day has its own natural tint,
its normal coloring, so in this long and brilliant period of
creation and of art each minute has had its characteristic
shade, and I do not wish to confound all these diversities and
blur them in an abstract formula. We can, however, sum up
and characterize in broad lines the work of Art belonging to
the human period, which was initiated a hundred and fifty
years ago by the works of thinkers who immediately preceded
and prepared the way for the Revolution.
Well, how can we characterize this grand period from
the point of view of art ? It became great at a single mighty
leap by means of an activity infinitely diverse and compre-
hensive. When democracy was causing the old barriers of
class distinction to fall and was saying to men, hitherto
chained by royal caprice and feudal stagnation, or by corporate
regulation, ?Go ahead; dare: try your luck in the vast
illimitable Universe ? ?at that time, when democracy seemed
to open to men, to all men, the social world, Science offered
them the whole stretch of time and the wide expanse of space
?history told them of past civilizations, science made clear
to them, with Buffon and Laplace, the origin of the planet;
archeology, the name of which appeared for the first time four
years before the Revolution?look at this extraordinary con-
junction of events; the great drama of modern times pre-
ceded by the word denot ng the science of ancient times, so
that men, intoxicated with knowledge, saw at the same time
opening before them an unlimited social future and the depths
of the past explored for the first time. There was at this
moment for men, for all men, as it were an intoxication of
thought, of visionary mental speculation, of activity, so that
never were forms of Art more diversified, more varied, more
strangely manifold than those which came forth from the
revolution of the middle classes. It may be said that for a
century and a half Art has had the genius and the freedom of
space and that it has penetrated everywhere, amongst all
peoples, into all periods, and into all the peculiarities of
civilisation and of nature, seeking for impressions, colors,


symbols ; so that all Art for a century and a half calls out to
us: ?Hail life, be eager to know every form of life ? ?lit.,
Have the universal curiosityjoj life. (Applause.)
That is the first characteristic (and I certainly do not
ignore the grandeur of it) of that period of Art which
coincides with middle-class democracy. And at the same
time all these individuals to whom the world opened itself
thus felt a sort of restlessness, of passionate aspiration, though
painful at the same time. Yes, the world was being revealed
to men; but had the individual the force to conquer and
possess it ? And each one compared the weakness of his own
resources, the smallness of his soul, the shortness of his life,
with the infinity of time, space, and action, which seemed to
lie open before him.
It is the ardent and painful dream of Faust, intoxicating
himself with the contemplation of nature, and saying ? What
a spectacle 1 But, alas 1 it is but a vision I How shall I
seize thee, oh infinite nature 1? It is the suffering of Werther,
of Obermann, of Btendhal, of Flaubert; it is the home-
sickness of Loti; it is the ardent aspiration, anxious and sad,
of all those who perceive the infinite in the beauty of life,
waiting to be moulded into shape, and having to confess the
weakness of their arms.
At the same time there is another feature of this great
period of art?it is the individualistic interpretation of nature
by man. For a hundred and twenty years, man, when he
appears before nature, only appears as an individual. He is
no longer tied by a positive faith, but only by an imperious
social organization to the human whole. Each individual
lives by himself, and for himself, and when he presents
himself to nature, when he interrogates her, he cannot be
accompanied, so to speak, by humanity itself. For it is
to-day too discordant, too confused, too contradictory, too
much given over to all the conflicts of passion, interests and
ideas to permit an individual to stand up before her and say:
? I am humanity.? And this is why for a hundred and
twenty years all men, all the creative geniuses, all the artists,
all the poets have given up confronting nature, which they
contemplate, with all humanity, of which they form a part.
They only interrogate it as individuals, either to interpret it,
like Chateaubriand, who entreated the thunders of the earth
and sea to rise and rock his passion to sleep?to interpret


nature through its breezes, its rays, its sadness by its
tempests, which bring them back to the events of their own
lives ; or on the other hand they are reduced to effacing them-
selves, to absorbing, to forgetting themselves in nature to
bringing forth, as some of our wonderful landscape painters
have done, landscapes in which nature seems to be quite
alone. Kecall to mind those beautiful verses of Sully-
Prudhomme, forgetting for a moment in the intimacy and
solitude of nature that men exist;?
And I may say, thinking of men, what do they ?
When the remembrance of loves and hates
Will lull me like the sound of distant seas.
These are the three decisive traits of the creation and the life
of Art for a century and a half?a wonderful and feverish
effort of mankind towards (new) perceptions, towards all the
forms of beauty and of life; the idealistic interpretation of
nature.
But there are other features, and these are the shadows.
The creation of Art, the life of Art in the democracy of the
middle classes, such as the revolution of the middle classes
has made it?although it is powerful, although it speaks with
the voice of thunder, although it brings the individual alone,
face to face with eternal nature?this life of Art is at once
chaotic and superficial.
It is chaotic; there is no longer in the work of Art as a
whole, in the artistic creation of mankind for the past century
and a half, any harmony or unity. Why ? Because there
are no longer ideas in common, unanimous conceptions,
which draw nearer, reunite and blend (the sympathies of) all
mankind, which, as a consequence, give to the work of Art the
expression of life, and which arrange and harmonise all the
the forces. The Universe is no longer disciplined, it is no
longer governed by the ancient religious hypotheses, which
have vanished before the light of science. Science is still but
an outline, and although it dissipates the phantoms of the
past, it cannot bring to men any final and ultimate con-
clusion. What would then remain in this confusion and
downfall of the old expiring religious beliefs, in this imperfect
birth of science; what would remain to mankind to consoli-
date and organize the idea of the Universe ? There would
only remain Humanity itself. But at the present time
Humanity?a human unity?has no existence. Men are too


much divided by the antagonism of the classes. The privilege
of property has created between them too many rivalries, has
opened up between them too many abysses for human unity
to be possible. There are humanities which rend each
other, and the Universe can only answer by an echo of discord
to the discord which comes from man. (Applause.)
You can see how the conception which we form of the
world varies according to the interests of the classes. There
are sections of the middle classes which try to retain, for the
preservation of their social privileges, beliefs to which their
mind no longer adheres; so that we launch forth on the
world a ray of light, which is dim, flickering and false.
Ah, we have seen in illustrious examples the impotence
of art and of artists, exponents of life, to produce in their
conception of the Universe and of man a unity which
humanity itself has not placed there. There are two notable
examples.
In the beginning of our century there was Goethe;
towards the close of our century Victor Hugo. They were
both marvellous artists ; yet look at the incapacity of Goethe
in that otherwise admirable work, ? Faust,? to propound to
men a clear idea of life. Faust accumulates force and energy
in a most wonderful manner. First he demands them from
his renewed youth ; then he seeks them from magic, and not
only from Christian magic, not only from the magic of the
Middle Ages, but he knows where to find, even under the shining
land of ancient Greece, the sombre magic lakes of the Thes-
salian regions. Nay more, to enable him to live so that he
may feel within him the fulness of life, he summons to his
aid all the occult forces of the depths of the Universe.
Excellent, when it is only a question of accumulating
and storing force; but in the second part of ? Faust,? when
it becomes necessary to say u hat use is to be made of these
forces, Goethe?s mind hesitates, perplexed and doubting. In
fact, the obscurities of the second part of ?Faust,? which
have been pointed out (by critics), really arise from the
incapacity, the utter inability, of perhaps the greatest of all
bourgeoise artists to indicate to the Universe and to man a
definite aim and purpose. This is why Faust, in the second
and last part of his work, proposes to himself the most
contradictory and uncertain aims ; and he extricates himself
from a definition of what action is by some mysterious return


to the eestacies of the Middle Ages and some semi-religious,
semi-sensual adoration of the Everlasting Feminine; proof,
indeed, of a vague and faltering conception, and proof, too,
that the greatest genius, the great prophet who foresaw and
predicted the new development of the human mind, was
incapable of giving it a clear name, a precise object, a definite
aim, because at the root of the revolution of the middle
classes, and before Socialism and Communism have truly
unified and organized mankind, there is nothing but discord
at the foundation of society, and because artists can only find
at the heart of life that which it contains to evolve it. (Loud
applause.)
And look at the last part of Hugo?s work. One would
have thought, after the master?s long experience of life, that
when he collected himself to give men a supreme and final
lesson, he would bring them a broad and firm conception.
In speaking of Hugo, Eenan said that he was the cymbalum
seculi , ?the cymbal of the century?: one who gives a body
to all our dreams, a form to each of our thoughts. Yet,
when he tries to sum up the philosophy of the century, he
becomes as indignant as a child whose brain has been tutored
by the Church. He is indignant at what ? Over the Dar-
winian theory, which traces the evolution of man from the
mere animal; he becomes indignant that man should be so
debased, so degraded; and he, the Pantheist?he, whose
poetical genius consisted in discovering, slumbering in the
flint, the sacred fire of the mind?he who said, ? There is no
animal that has not some reflection of the Infinite ? ?with
the most marvellous incoherence, when it becomes a matter
of precise and definite statement, is indignant that science
should state that humanity has risen by means of evolution
from the lower animal kingdom.
Incoherence, weakness, impotence! Impotence of the
greatest ?mark well?of the greatest genius, constitutional
impotence, which considers that the humanity of to-day?
being divided against itself, incoherent, discordant, carrying
in its very entrails economic and intellectual strife?is
incapable of producing, even at the hands of the greatest
genius, a fully homogeneous and harmonious work of art.
(Loud applause.)
And at the same time I say that the life of Art, such as
it has been made by the middle class revolutionary period, is


superficial: it does not sound all the depths of the people. I
have applauded with you the marvellous appeal that Anatole
France has just addressed to the artisans and artists. Yes,
there is no such thing as the beauty of the Fine Arts, as dis-
tinguished from the beauty of the Arts of Industry. There is
only the one (pervading) beauty, which shows its identity
through a diversity of processes ; but the artisan, the gold-
smith, the carver, the gold-beater, the moulder, the typo-
grapher do not represent the totality of manual labor of the
work of the proletariat in capitalistic society ; and the question
now is to know, for those who wish to lay the foundations for
the life of Art, for those who wish all men to participate in it,
that all humanity should pass through this light. The
question we have to ask is, whether the middle classes have
been able to make Art and the life of Art penetrate to the
depths of social life and the proletariat conscience.
Well, I say ? No.? And this is what condemns the pro-
visional civilization of to-day. I know well enough that in
the most mechanical industrial work there are elements of
beauty, not only in the masterpiece of the artizan, but in the
apparently mechanical work of the factory hand. I was
reading the other day in a recent book of Rosny?s a very fine
passage. It points out the wonderful ingenuity of all me-
chanical inventions, which produce at the present time the
enormous quantity of goods which circulate in our markets.
He says: ?But this ingenuity, this genius of mechanical
science, has passed, so to speak, into the brain, into the
hands, into the muscles of the workmen who put in motion
these perfected mechanical forces.?
Yes, the workman is obliged to put in motion in ships,
in locomotives, in the operation of weaving, mechanism more
and more complex, more and more perfected, which represents
a crushing volume of human thought and human genius ; so
that the working class is the class in which the (accumulated)
genius of humanity, the genius of inventors, is, as it were,
incorporated.
Through it genius takes, so to speak, shape as an organic
whole; it becomes flesh, nerve, muscle; it incorporates
within itself the genius of all the great thinkers, of all the
inventors, so that Rosny is right in saying that to-day the
proletariat class is the true intellectual class. (Warm and
prolonged applause.)


But if there are here wonderful elements of intelligence
and wonderful elements of beauty, that does not justify one
in saying that the proletariat has entered, has ascended to the
sphere of Art. No; Art has not penetrated to the depths of
Labor, because Democracy has not pervaded it either.
Democracy remains at the surface in our polity. All men are
theoretically sovereign and theoretically equal; but in the
workshop the omnipotence of Capital dominates enslaved
Labor. Without powers of direction and without guarantee,
Democracy has not penetrated to the workshop?that is to
say, in Labor, and as it is Labor which is life itself, Demo-
cracy has remained at the surface ; it has not penetrated the
depths, neither has Art penetrated the depths.
What, then, is really necessary so that a class may be
truly artistic ? Two things are necessary; it must have at
its disposal a means of expression, which it can use readily to
interpret, to intensify, its emotions and its sensations.
It is useless in the presence of a spectacle of nature or a
movement of humanity to feel a profound emotion, a unique
sensation, if you cannot interpret it to yourself before trans-
mitting it to others by means of appropriate expression?this
sensation, this nascent glimmer of the beautiful, extinguished
in you like a flame which does not reach an atmosphere where
it can burn. Well, the proletariat class in France, which
to-day consists of the working and peasant classes, have not
at their disposal sufficient means of expression to interpret in
the beauty of art its sensations, its thoughts, and its
dreams.
It is a disgrace to the society of to-day that there are so
many men, so many workers, so many of the proletariat
crushed by their daily labor, having received no education
and training, and who do not possess in its beauty, in its
power, in its wealth, the subtlety of its shades of expression,
this French language, created by the genius of thinkers, of
writers, of artists. Ah, the aristocrats from outside know all
the niceties of the French language, and the civilization of
to-day has refused to the peasant and the workman the means
of penetrating these treasures, which have been stored up by
the genius of generations. (Prolonged applause.)
So long as Socialism has not completed popular education
by giving to all workers the complete art of using, and the


delicate perception of, all the riches of our language, the
proletariat will not have risen to the height of Art.
And then there is another fatality; there is another
servitude which prevents the proletariat class to-day from
constituting a part of artistic humanity. Citizens, to do the
work of an artist, to enjoy Art, to rise to a conception of the
beautiful, we must control our own life, we must control our
own work. Whoever is the slave of his own life, whoever
cannot rise above the level of his own work, whoever cannot
connect himself by thought and happiness with the movement
of humanity as a whole, cannot truly attain the life of Art.
Ah, how few peasants are able to feel the conception of
artistic beauty awaken within them. Yet they are in im-
mediate, constant contact with all the beauties of nature, with
all its grandeur and with all its changes. But as they are
engrossed in their hard work, as they only dream of extracting
from the niggardly soil a few crowns and a few pounds ; since
they are incapable of bringing their efforts into line with
human effort as a whole, and the effort of humanity with the
movement of the Universe, whose changes and seasons unfold
themselves before them, they are incapable of raising them-
selves to a clear notion, to a (true) perception of the beautiful.
They are sunk in the ground up to the heart and the weight
of earth stifles the heart-beat. (Applause.)
I have sometimes seen in our country roads poor old
peasant women returning from the forest, carrying?not on
their shoulders but on their back?a whole load of green
branches. (Interruption: a dissentient voice is drowned by
applause.) And the wind, passing through this foliage,
aroused around the old peasant woman, as it were, a great
rustling of the forest. But she heard it not, and walked on
with mechanical step, without understanding this dream-song
which this little bit of the forest that she was carrying away
murmured in her ear. Well, the peasant of the proletariat
walks on just in this way, surrounded by the whispered
inspiration of Nature, but he heeds it not. Indeed, how can
you imagine that after his twelve hours, his fourteen hours,
his fifteen hours of factory labor, when he has the feeling that
this mechanical and prolonged work is not free (and volun-
tary), that the next day he may be dismissed by the brutality
of his master, by mere force of circumstances or by the
severity of men or the exigencies of the labor market, how


can you imagine that the workman?harnessed to his
machines which sap his strength and which may fail him
to-morrow?how can you imagine that he, thus crushed, thus
enslaved, always having thought for his bread of to-morrow,
for himself or those belonging to him, how can one expect
that his thoughts should be able to soar in dreamland above
all these deafening noises of machinery and say : ? This noise
of machinery at work is a part of the universal harmony ??
That he will know to-morrow when we have freed him. (Long
continued applause).
It is thus that Socialism will call to the life of Art, to the
life of the beautiful, human beings, whoever they may be.
It is Socialism which will for the first time invest the
proletariat, now disinherited, with the sacred beauty of Art.
Oh, artists fear us not! It is we who will be the first to
summon before your masterpieces, no longer divided frag-
ments of humanity, no longer an aristocracy bloated and
Uas6, followed by a blind crowd, but one humanity, fraternal
and free. It is we who for the first time will create human
Art. There have been till now mere shreds of human Art,
because till now there have been mere detached fragments of
humanity. (Loud applause.)
Ah, yes ! we can conceive, without being exactly able to
define it, that from this coming of the social spring-time will
burst forth a wonderful artistic spring. For the first time,
Humanity as such will be face to face with Nature; every
man in contemplating it, interrogating it, will feel in himself
the familiar presence of all humanity; and it is through each
individual that the whole of humanity will interrogate and
contemplate nature. Then, too, for the first time all
humanity will at this point have thrown off the shackles of
nature ; it will dominate nature from so great a height that
it will be able to interpret her with more confidence and more
gentleness. So long as all we men war one against the other;
so long as there remain among us social inequalities, ranging
men, whatever may be the individual worta of their souls,
into two classes?those who impose upon others and those
who are imposed upon ; so long as there shall be amongst us
antagonistic classes ; so long as the reign of force exists, we
shall be part of nature. For that which characterises nature
is the predominance of force. Humanity will only escape for


the first time from nature when she shall have subdued force
in her own breast?when she shall have created within herself
a truly fraternal harmony. Then will humanity rise above
all the brutalities of nature and say to them: ?I have
escaped from you; I have escaped from the old-time servitude
of hatred, of murder, of ferocity. lam humanity, fraternal
and kind !? At the same time humanity will say to herself:
? As I have become good, I, who came from this nature, there
must lie sleeping in this nature, notwithstanding its brutali-
ties, mysteries of goodness and of hidden tendernesses.?
And we shall feel a new bond establish itself between
humanity and nature. All the unknown tendernesses which
lie dormant in the depths of things will have become visible
and luminous in emancipated humanity. (Applause.)
Do not tell me that I am putting off the creative effort
of artists, who are drawing in the still uncertain breaths of
socialistic thought. Do not say that lam putting off their
creative effort until the full advent of the new order?the
communist order?in all its integrity.
No, no, even at the present day?nay, a century ago?
socialistic thought began, obscurely, insufficiently; but it
had, in fact, began to act on Art itself. For almost a century
there has been a commencement of Socialism, and in conse-
quence there is a beginning of the action of Socialism upon
social life, and on Art, which is the expression of it. Do
you know that it is to the first large Socialist schools ?to
Fourierism and to St. Simonism?that we owe the positive
new departure of Romanticism and the most beautiful works
of Hugo ?
You know that at the beginning Romanticism was of a
feudal, reactionary character, monarchical, and, as some
young men say to-day, belonging to the Middle Ages. You
know that Hugo had begun by extolling the virgins of Verdun,
and the ancient royalty, dogmas and religions, the throne
and the altar. You know that be ran the risk of wasting his
genius in vague sentimentalities. Well, Fourier and St.
Simon intervened, and Fourier said to the Romanticists:
? Do not dissipate your thought in vagueness and in the
phantoms of lunar landscapes. Do not say, Mr. Hugo, to
the man who is passing at nightfall?
Where leadest thou so late thy patient horse ?


We, the innovators?we, the creators of a new world?we
will create a human light more beautiful than all the moon-
beams, amidst which your muse walks in so melancholy a
mood.? ? And we,? said St. Simon, ?ask you Romanticists
not to turn towards the past, not to separate yourself from
the flowing tide of the ages. You must??these are the
expressions used by St. Simon?? you must create a great
art of common sense (sensus communis) ?that is to say, an
art gathering inspiration not from individual fancies, more
or less frivolous, but from a grand common thought, from a
grand social thought. Give up retrograde imagination.?
And thus, warned by St. Simon?s conception, diffused every-
where under the Restoration and under Louis Phillippe,
Romanticism turns towards the future. Hugo has not shut
himself up in the worship of fallen idols; he has felt the
great tide of ages, and has written the ? Legend of the
Ages.?
In the same way, when in 1848 a Socialist wave of
thought made its appearance and the Revolution burst, it was
this socialistic idea which revealed to Wagner the fulness of
his genius and all the meaning of his work. There is no
contesting this fact: it was Communism that revealed Art to
him ; it was Communism which, by the bringing together of
all divisions of society?by the intended amalgamation of all
human energy?inspired Wagner with the idea of realizing
this unity in Art; of no longer disassociating painting, the
drama, and music, but of forming with all these forces a
whole, a harmony, a unity, a world. And it is characteristic
of the work of Wagner that he has grouped around an ardent
inspiration?around an individual soul?a whole world of
pictures, of faces, of colors, of sounds?an orchestration
almost infinite: it is, as it were, a mighty central wave,
which spreads and imparts its rhythm to the swell of the
ocean: it is the mark of Communism. And even now, in
the work of one of the greatest masters of painting and art?
in the work of Puvis de Chavannes?we can just perceive the
serenity of humanity, reconciled with itself and reconciled
with nature. You have admired that series of landscapes?
so soothing and so vast ?which range from the Chaldean
peasant contemplating the stars of the nocturnal heavens to
that magnificent amphitheatre of the Sorbonne, with its blue
and green lights, where the agure of the sky and the young


sap of the budding leaves seem to be blended; you have all
seen this brightness enveloping groups of men who think and
meditate. This is humanity?happy, fraternal; it is a
pictorial forecast of the society of to-morrow. And it has
sufficed Puvis de Chavannes to dream of vast panoramas
breathing peace and harmony ; to foretell, to sketch before-
hand that which we dream of. It would seem that the
communistic ideal has touched him with its rays before even
having risen, to recall those beautiful verses of Hugo where
he shows in the summer night, before even the sun has risen,
the dawn quite ready:
And the dawn, sweet and pale, waiting long for its hour,
Seems to wander all night at the foot of the heavens.
Well the dawn of serenity, of sweetness, which we dream
of, it seems to have come before the appointed hour to light
up the masterly work of Puvis de Chevannes, it is like the
white and soft Milky Way, which has traversed, from the
beginning of the centuries, the confusion of the times, the
brutality of things. (Applause.)
Thus even the first glimmer of Socialistic light?the
communism of to-morrow ?begins to penetrate the Art of
to-day. Ah ! do you not see how the rhythm of artistic
creations seems already to sway towards justice ? I will say
nothing of the work of Anatole France, how by exposing with
a light and subtle hand all the roots and all the rootlets of
lying which feed our society, he has by this alone stopped the
flow of the sap and gently condemned to death the tree of
injustice, which he only seemed to be looking at. (Laughter,
applause, repeated shouts of ? Vive Anatole France.?)
And you can also see how the work of Zola has turned
towards fighting and the battlefield. Ah !he seemed to think
that it would be only the wide and slow movement of life
which would sweep away, little by little, by the physiological
renewing of generations alone the servitudes, the miseries,
and the ignorances of former times. And he developed
throughout his work the mighty stream which hurried along
pell-mell the rubbish of the city, the innumerable germs
which the trees on the bank let fall, and the wandering
reflections of the moving and uncertain skies. And Zola
seemed to expect that this great mixed flood would carry
all the miseries and all the slavery, And all at once this


slow, turbid, yet calm stream hurls itself on a great iniquity*
and is upheaved with a magnificent burst of anger. (Pro-
longed applause.) All work to-day, in proportion as life acts
more strongly and more largely upon it, every work partici-
pates more and more in a glorification of justice and of work
and in the proclaiming of a new social order. Ah ! you can
see that we are all the beauty, because we are all the truth ;
you know, you see, that the others can no longer live but by
trickery, by hypocrisy and by lies. They pretend to believe
in things in which they no longer believe?and they desire so
much to accustom the country to live by lies?that, even
when it is evident, even when it is flagrant, even when the
facts demonstrate lies they endeavor to shut the mouths of
the facts themselves which show the reality of life.
You saw it yesterday and you see it to-day. There was a
soldier, Yillebois de Mareuilf, who wished to fight,and befell
in a distant country for a cause which I do not inquire into
and which Ido not judge. He certainly wished to fight?he
perhaps wished to die ; but before dying, and because he had
no doubt great grievances against certain men and against
certain things, he wrote : ? Militarism, I despise it. Mercier,
I condemn him. The Church, I don?t want any of her
prayers.? ... He was there one with us. Well, they
nevertheless seize him, and in spite of him?although he is
buried according to his wish in a foreign land?in spite of
this they are going to inflict patriotic prayers on him, and
like a yellow taper. . . . (Interruption; the
person who has previously given vent to adverse sentiments is
violently ejected and the whole hall re-echoes with long and
ringing applause.)
The Citizen Anatole France; Citizens show by your
calmness that you are in the right. (Applause.)
Citizen Jaures : If I had foreseen this incident, the cause
of which I am ignorant of, I should have asked the meeting
to show a little less excitement. It will not be out of place,
moreover, to prove once more?and I would beg you to add
no comment on my words, above all by gestures (laughter)?

very root, the whole of society by denouncing the falsehood
upon which it rests, and I did not succeed in raising a single
protest; but I have been unable to pronounce the name of
Monsieur Coppee without exciting uproar. Truly I must say
to the gentleman who interrupted that he gave vent to his
indignation in a very foolish manner. (Laughter.) I wish
to demonstrate by this example the spirit of lying by which
the institutions of to-day shield themselves. You see these
infuriated, obstinate men bent on taking possession of a man
who cursed and denounced them, and you see them obstinately
bent ?to use the instance against us? on pouring out their
prayers over a grave which protests against and refuses them.
Everywhere hypocrisy, everywhere artificial combinations,
everywhere lying, everywhere, in consequence, the negation of
life, the negation of beauty. And it is because we claim to be
truth in action, life itself in its necessary evolution, that we
believe we shall be able more than all others to help creative
Art to soar aloft.
This is why I appeal to all those who dream of beauty,
who dream of an ideal; and I beg them to join their force to
this force of the beautiful, which even now is the organized
proletariat on the march towards justice. Artists, if you will,
let us form an alliance. (The entire hall applauded the
prator. Prolonged shouts of Vive Jaures, and long applause.)
