DARDANELLES COMMISSION.
Supplement to First Report.
THE Government authorise publication of the following notes, which, so far as
public interests allow, replace the sense of some of the portions excised from the full
Report of the Dardanelles Commission :
REPORT BY THE COMMISSION.
Paragraph 45.
Towards the end of August 1914 Mr. Churchill formed the opinion that Turkey
would join the Central Powers. On the Ist September he wrote privately to General
Douglas, who was then Chief of the Imperial General Staff, in the following terms :
" I arranged with Lord Kitchener yesterday that two officers from the
Admiralty should meet two officers from the D.M.O's. Department of the War
Office to-day to examine and work out a plan for the seizure, by means of a Greek
Army of adequate strength, of the Gallipoli Peninsula, with a view to admitting a
British Pleet to the Sea of Marmora.
" In his absence I would ask you to give the necessary directions, as the
matter is urgent, and Turkey may make war on us at any moment.
" The meeting can take place either here or at the War Office as soon as you
can arrange with our Chief of the Staff. I will myself explain verbally to the
Committee the points on which His Majesty's Government desire information."
On September 3rd General Oallwell, the Director of Military Operations, wrote a
Memorandum on the subject, in which he said that —
" it ought to be clearly understood that an attack upon the Gallipoli Peninsula
from the sea side (outside the Straits) is likely to prove an extremely difficult
operation of war."
He referred to the discussions which had taken place in 1906-07, and expressed
the opinion that it would not be justifiable to undertake the operation with an army
of less than 60,000 men.
Paragraph 94.
An officer from the Admiralty was asked the following question: " Did the
intelligence in your possession favour the idea that the arrival of the British Fleet
would have produced a revolution in Constantinople ? " He replied: " Oh, yes ;
certainly it would. I feel no hesitation in saying that."
Paragraph 119.
At the time of the bombardment it was suspected by the Admiralty that the forts
of the Dardanelles were getting short of ammunition. Evidence was subsequently
obtained which showed that the suspicion was well-grounded.
MINUTE BY MR. ROCH.
Paragraph 43.
The success of this first attack at once produced important diplomatic results.
The eyes of the Balkan nations were fixed on the Dardanelles.
[4o6]


On March Ist the British Minister in Athens telegraphed that M. Venizelos
proposed to offer the co-operation of a Greek army corps of three divisions in the
Gallipoli Peninsula. He telegraphed again on the 2nd that this proposal had been
made after the King had already been " sounded," and that he heard from another
source that the King " wanted war."
*•## * # #
Within a fortnight Intelligence reports showed that the Turks were moving back
to Adrianople and developing their front against Bulgaria.
On March 17th General Paget, who was engaged on a special mission in the
Balkans, telegraphed to Lord Kitchener that —
" The operations in the Dardanelles have made a deep impression ; that all
possibilities of Bulgaria attacking any Balkan State that might side with the
Entente is now over,, and there is some reason to think that shortly the Bulgarian
Army will move against Turkey to co-operate in the Dardanelles operations."
