A BOOKLET OF BIRD-VERSE FOR THE CHILDREN,

FOREWORD.
It may be of interest to those bird lovers, into whose
hands this modest Booklet comes, to learn of its origin and
purpose. The writer has reason to be grateful for the songs
of the birds around his home during years of confinement
therein. As a mark of affection for his feathered-favourites,
and in hopes of fostering the love of children for them, the
production of this Booklet by hand for private circulation
was attempted. With a typewriter in bed. calls were made
upon a rather unpractised pen for pictures, and upon very
surprised Muses for verse, but there were thoughts of the
kindly reception awaiting the effort from friends, and it
began. At the outset hand production proved unequal to
the demand for copies, and thus advice to publish was
tendered. Now, the writer knew full well that friends are the
worst persons from whom to take such advice, but physical
disabilities prevented him from otherwise satisfying them in
any way. And here it is. May it help to swell the mem-
bership of the Gould League of Bird Lovers, and induce
parents to purchase those fine works: l “What Bird is
That? ‘ by N. Cayley, “Nature Fantasy in Australia”, by
A. H. Chisholm, and “An Australian Bird Book”, by J.
A. Leach, the last-named of which I have had by me for
twenty years, drawing from its use most of the information
included in the Booklet, with grateful acknowledgment.

YELLOW-BREASTED SHRIKE-ROBIN: Wild Canary, Yellow
Bob. Dark grey; upper base tail olive-yellow; throat grey-white;
breast bright yellow. Eats insects. Varied piping song.


YELLOW-BREASTED ROBIN
I love my little Robin best
Of all the birds I see,
And in his lovely yellow breast
I know he, too, loves me.
They call him Psalmster of the Dawn,
But Yellow Bob does me;
He sings to me from early morn.
Away up in a tree.
I’m sure he calls me Sleepy-head,
For I’m slow coming out;
His sweet canary call from bed
Is nice to hear, no doubt.
I have a little garden plot
I dig with Yellow Bob.
He catches worms —O, such a lot !
•While I am on the job.
I like to pull up things and try
To see the way they root;
While Bob, to catch a grub, will fly
Right down beside my boot !
And when I hose him in the garden,
(He will get in the way!)
I never say: “I beg your pardon,”
Bob likes the fine cool spray.
He shuts his feathers, O, so tight!
That ne’er his skin gets wet.
And shakes the water off in flight.
And so I need not fret.
And when Bob goes to nest at night
He sings his evening hymn;
And God who loves the birds all right
Just keeps him safe with Him.


LAUGH INC KINGFISHER: Kookaburra, Laughing Jackass.
Upper, line past eye, brown; side head and under whitish; blue, white
spots on wings; tail barred black and white. Eats mice, lizards, insects,
snakes. Peels of human laughter.


A BUSH BANQUET.
O, Kook! Kook! Kook!
And Ha! Ha! Ha”
Tried ‘Johnny Cook’
“Why! Here we are !”
So laughed a flock of Kookaburras
From out a great gum-tree.
The gullies of the Minnamurras
Resounding with their glee.
Then, suddenly, there was a parting !
One Jackass, wide awake.
On well-extended wings down-darting.
Had swooped upon a snake!
With powerful grip of ample beak
Behind the reptile’s head.
He raised the wriggling serpent sleek
And to a tree-top sped !
From there he let his victim drop
Upon the hard-worn track.
Where, falling with a woeful flop,
It writhed with broken back !
The process he repeated till
The reptile’s wriggling ceased.
When every bird with snap of bill
Flew down to make a feast!
Then, “Kook! Kook! Kook!
And Ha! Ha ! Ha!”
Cried johnny Cook,
"We’re off! Ta ! Ta!”


RED-CAPPED ROBIN (NOT Redhead ): Crown, breast, scarlet;
upper neck black; white on wing, abdomen and under tail. Eats
insects. Sings.


MY PRETTY PLAYMATE.
“Do you know who is my playmate
On my holiday, Papa?
You won’t guess a Red-capped Robin,
But he is! So there you are!”
“I was sitting on the verandah,
The first morning at the Vale,
When along he came a-bobbing
Till he hopped upon the rail I
“So I sat as still as Granny
And the Robin came quite near
He began to eat my crumbs up,
Did the pretty little dear 1
“He has legs like thin black fermtalks.
And a red cap like his breast;
And his wings have some white feathers,
But he’s black for all the rest."
“Granny wouldn’t let me catch him, —
I don’t think she thought I could
But a pinch of salt would help me,
I am pretty sure it would.”
“But I couldn’t take him with me
Into bed, at any rate.
For his legs and beak might come off,
Like my toy-bird from Aunt Kate.”
“I took paper and a pencil
And, to do his breast, red ink.
But I made his picture something
Like a carrot, they all think!”
“So I’ll wait till I am back at
Home, for you to draw my mate;
And I’ll lend you my best paint-box
So you’ll make him look first rate."


SUPERB WARBLER: Blue Wren, Blue Bonnet, Crown, be-
hind ear, and upper back enamel blue; tail deep blue-black; rest black.
Eats insects. Fussy song.


THE WARBLER ON THE WING
There’s a rustling m the leafy vine
As the Warblers flit about
Where with trellis many stems entwine.
Tis a leafage fine to scout,
And on insect fare they all must dine,
When a Blue Wren’s family’s out.
His black coat, to vie with any other,
With enamel blue he cheers;
While his wife, the Jenny Wren, wee mother,
Is in brown like all her dears;
As his ‘blue’ is not for tiny brother
Till he enters adult years.
What a fussy little song they sing.
As they hop from stem to stem.
Or look round for prey on flitting wing.
With an eye like glistening gem,
Tis small wonder they ne’er miss a thing
That is meat or drink to them!
With the leafage now well cleaned of all
Save the woolly grub or snail.
The superb wee birdie pipes his call,
As he stands erect ©f tail;
And away all fly along the wall
For a drink at yonder pail.
But, O. Shame! If what is said be true
Of a thoughtless, cruel boy!—
That, attracted by the Blue Wren’s hue,
He had sought him to destroy!
How can any boy such ill deeds do.
And his happy youth enjoy?


BLACK AND WHITE F ANT AIL (Willie Wagtail, Shepherds
Companion) : Upper, throat, breast black; eyebrow and rest under
while. Eats insects. “Sweet pretty little creature.


A WILLIE WAGTAIL’S WAYS
“Sweet pretty little creature!”
The Willie Wagtail sings,
And if we note each feature
His song most truly rings.
His soot-black coat becomes him.
Along with snowwhite vest,
As, swaying on the tree-limb.
His fantail knows no rest.
To friendly milch cow grazing
Our Willie forthwith flies.
And flits around whilst catching
The insects as they rise.
And though his eyes gleam mildly
’Neath friendly brows of white.
They also can flash wildly.
Like those of tourney knight.
For, when his nest he’s tending.
Sharp sallies from a log
He’ll make, in its defending
From hostile cat or dog.
Companion of the shepherd.
His song is heard at night.
When loneliness is tempered
By rising moon’s pale light.
And of the Wagtail’s brightness
We should a pattern make—
With confidence and lightness
Our tasks to undertake.


SCARLET-BREASTED RODIN: Head, throat, upper blacfy;
white on wings, abdomen; cap white; breast scarlet. Insects. Sings.


THE
SCARLET-BREASTED ROBIN
A mother, one evening late,
Sat anxiously on her nest
Awaiting her red-breast mate,
Her daughter therein at rest.
At length the wee nestling woke,
And, noting her mother’s care,
In wondering accents spoke
Concerning Papa’s welfare.
Then, keen in her baby mind.
The little one asked Mamma,
“Why is it you often find
Papas so much brighter are?
“The reason’s not hard to glean,”
Came readily in reply,
“Bright feathers are easily seen
By enemies flying by.”
“While sitting on eggs ail day.
My brown does not catch the eye
Of hawks, out in search of prey.
That chance to be passing nigh.
"When, presently, Rob returned
From helping a once kind brother.
Said mother, now less concerned,
“A good turn deserves another.”


MACPIE-LARK ( Mudlark . Pee.-met): Blacl\ and white, slender
legs. Throat (male) black, ( female ) white. Mud nest. Eats
insects, pond snails. “Pee-wee.”


THE PEE-WEE IN THE PARK.
I miss the dainty Magpie Lark
That would with laboured flight
Each morning in the local park
On slender legs alight.
So straight his heavy course he’d set.
You’d think he bore a weight;
And from the muddy pond he’d get
The snails his palate sate.
In this he is the graziers’ friend;
From liver fluke s dread toll
Their thirsting flocks he’d help defend
At creek or water-hole.
With White-winged Chough, Apostle Bird;
And Swallow does he share
A love of mud-built nest, preferred
By these Australians rare.
A well-kept plumage lent him grace.
Although but black and white;
His eyes, set gem-like in his face.
Were lit with pale blue light.
I picture now his stilt-like walk,
And o’er the park to me
There comes so clearly, as I talk.
His strident call “Pee-wee!”


CREY SHRIKE-THRUSH (Grey Thrush) : Crey; hack pah
umber-broom; under lighter; face mhitish. Insects. Powerful swelling
harmonious notes.


THE
SONG OF THE THRUSH.
“What bird is that? Oh! mother dear,
Just look! He’s flying down!”
With smooth grey breast he settled near.
His back pale umber brown.
“Why! That’s a Thrush,” the mother said,
“Of sweet harmonious song.”
Quite tame, he raised his shapely head
And calmly hopped along.
“I wish the friendly dear would sing!”
Came with endearing term;
But, gliding down on outstretched wing.
The Shrike-Thrush caught a worm.
“That’s what he came to get, my dear,”
The mother laughed. But now
The bird is back with them, quite near.
Prepared to make his bow.
“He’s happy now,” the daughter said,
“Perhaps his song we’ll hear;”
As though the thrush her meaning read.
His notes rang out so clear!
They watched the throbbing of his throat.
As o’er the air there went
Such song as never human wrote,
In swelling sweetness sent.
“What instrument could make such sounds?”
The daughter keenly asks.
As, while once more his song resounds,
The Thrush in sunshine basks.
“All music is from Heaven sent,”
The mother said, with hush,
“To sing our thanks to God ’twas meant.
In fullness, like the Thrush.”


RESTLESS FLYCATCHER ( Scisscrs-grinder , NOT Wagtail ) :
Upper glossy black; under while. £7£e the Black and White Fantail,
but throat white and a larger head. Insects. Harsh call "Tchu-whee."


'v -V
THE SCISSORS GRINDER.
“Oh! Look ! The Scissors Grinder’s here!”
I said in quiet tones to mother.
And kissed her on the cheek.
‘Well, dear,” she whispered at my ear,
“Just tell him we have nothing other
Than what he did last week.”
“Ha! Ha!” I laughed. “He’s nowhere near!
It’s only Willie Wagtail’s brother.
Fly-catching with his beak!”
"Just look! He’s there upon the fence!
He’s peering at those tail-grown weeds,
Thev’re full of insects small.”
And as I speak he tumbles thence
With scissors-grinding sounds, and feeds
While on his downward fall!
Then, where the growth is high and dense,
By restless hovering he succeeds
In making quite a haul!
“Snap! Snap?” his beak resounds, “Snap! Snap!”
And to the fence he flies to rest.
And wipes off insects’ wings!
And, having cleaned his beaky trap.
He raises it as suits him best,
And joyfully now sings.
“Tchu-wee! Tchu-wee!” he calls, mayhap.
His white throat throbbing o’er his chest
Ere back the echo rings.


PALLID CUCKOO (Scale Bird, Brain-fever Bird): Upper
brown; under grey; eyelash yellow; edge of wing while; tail barred
while and brown. Eats caterpillars and insects. Runs up scale.


THE HARBINGER OF SPRING.
“Tee! Tiddly-iddly-diddly-widdly-winky 1 ”
Came in ascending scale upon the breeze;
“Tee! Tiddly-iddly-diddly-widdly-winky!”
In dulcet semi-tones from out the trees.
The Pallid Cuckoo, Harbinger of Spring,
Was giving forth his song in cadence sweet,
Inspired thus his quaint refrain to sing
September’s welcome warmth to gladly greet.
Alike in genus and appearance bright,
Tho not by any means of song the same,
As Springtime’s herald it was thought but right
Australia s bird should share the English name.
Wee-wee! he calls by night,
At times with such persistency absurd
That he has earned, from those who claim the right
To sleep in peace, the name Brain-fever Bird!
His own kind, too, the Cuckoo will molest.
For, ever loth to rear their own young brood.
Their eggs are laid within another’s nest.
The foster parents oft supplying food!
The Cuckoo’s greatest use to man, indeed.
Arises from the care he gives the vine.
For, while he does no harm to what we need,
On hairy caterpillars will he dine.


SPINEDILL ( Honey-eater, Humming Bird) : Back brovn; crown,
outline chest, wings, tail black; patch on throat, abdomen light chest-
nut brown; chest, edge of tail while; eye scarlet. Eats honey and
insects. Strong humming call.


THE BUSY SPINEBILL.
I love to watch the Spinebill gay
At work among the flowers.
As in the garden every day
He spends his busy hours.
Monotonous his humming song
And delicate his tasks.
He alternates them all day long,
But rest he seldom asks.
He’ll hover on fast flitting wing.
Inserting awl like bill.
Or, pendent, to a vine-stem cling
To take from flower his fill.
With sooty wings and cap and tail,
His chestnut body bright
Completes a gay contrasting mail
With throat and breast of white.
He has a brush-like tongue to get
The honey to his bill.
And never have I noticed yet
That honey-eater still!


AUSTRALIAN BROWN FLYCATCHER. ( Jacky Winter.
Post-boy) : Upper pale brown; under lighter; side tail, chin, abdo-
men white. Eats insects. “Peter, Peter."


JACKY WINTER
There’s a fluffy little bird on our line;
Jacky Winter is his name.
As he’s sitting there his eye catches mine,
And I know just why he came.
He is thinking of a mother with two
Tiny fledglings in her nest.
With their beaks wide open pleading anew
For the insects they like best.
He has singled out papa as his host,
For Pa’s digging in the plot;
So, on outstretched wing he glides to a post,
Just to see what can be got.
When a whitish, wrinkled grub lies on top
Of the freshly upturned soil.
Jacky reaches it with flutter and hop.
Soon departing with his spoil.
For the gaping pair of mouths *tis but one,
But he feeds each one in turn,
Till, on tireless wing, his duty is done.
And relieved his chief concern.
So that, flying to a tree within sight
Of his nest-home on the slope.
He is preening well his plumes, brown and white,
With a pride that’s full of hope.
And contentment in his brood brings him glee
As he views them from above;
And his song, tho’ “Peter! Peter!” it be,
Is to God a lay of Love.


BLACK-BACKED MAGPIE (Piping Crow-Shrike. Carol Bird):
Black; hind head, base tail, patch wing Me. Eats insects. Glorious
modulated carol.


THE CAROL BIRD.
To greet me at break of day!”
“How I wish you could hear their corroboree,
With its wonderful chorus of song.
On mornings of glistening dew!
Or could see them aloft in a tall gum tree
In a rollicking, frolicking throng!
I’m sure they would gladden you.”
“I like calling the songster the Carol Bird,
As he’s not a true Magpie, in class.
But one of our own Crow-Shrikes.
“As you ask what appeals to me most up here,’’
Wrote a city-bred lad from the land,
“Why! then, without doubt, I say:
“ ‘Tis the glorious carol in flute-notes clear.
As it comes from the Magpies at hand
There’s a tame one in town, though it seems absurd,
That’s a mimic you’d never surpass,
And whistles what tunes he likes!’’
“He’s about the verandah of Jenkin’s store,
And there’s not much that misses his eye
Or dodges his biting bill!
Being caught as a fledgling, he knows no more
Of his natural life than do I,
But sings while he gets his fill!”
“Yet the thoughtful will say: "Let a bird be free
To rejoice in the life that was meant
By God, its Creator wise,
With His purpose for birds, as for you and me.
It is not for the cage they are sent,
But freedom beneath the skies.”
