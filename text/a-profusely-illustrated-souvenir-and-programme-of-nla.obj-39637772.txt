History of the Australian Game
By H. D. NEWBY, B.A., LL.B.
It is said that wherever Britons go they take their games
with them. But we shall have to extend this statement
by saying that those of the British stock who people this
, sunny land of Australia have vastly improved upon the
game -which their forbears brought with them. And it
is no fanciful conjecture that the popularity of “ the Aus-
tralian game ” has already established it as our national
Australian winter pastime. If proof were needed, we
should find it in the present Jubilee Carnival of Australian
Football, and in the extraordinary perfection of skill and
science displayed by the teams at present visiting Mel-
bourne from each of the sister States and from the island
Dominion of New' Zealand. Nor does the growing popu-
larity of the Australian game end there. For, in Canada,
in South Africa, and even the United States of America,
the game is finding favour and popularity, alike with
players and spectators; while, even in conversative old Eng-
land, where tradition dies so hard, and prejudice is as
strong in sport as in politics and trade, an attempt is
being made to introduce it in the great Public Schools.
Is it too much to forecast that those who live to see
the centenary of the Australian game will witness the
competition of teams from all parts of the Empire for
the honor of the Imperial Premiership?

EARLY BEGINNINGS.
" What great events from trivial causes spring," is an
oft quoted phrase from Homer; and it finds appropriate
illustration in tracing the beginnings of the Australian
game fifty years ago. To kick something, an inflated
ball for choice, and to do so in a competitive spirit, has
always been characteristic of Britons, whether at the
Australian diggings in the '' roaring fifties ” or in modern
sun-baked India .amongst “ the Tommies." And thus, says
the chronicler, the diggers of remote Victorian days found
occupation and sport each Sunday (there were no " social
Jas. Sleight
reform ’’ gentry in those days) in football, under non-
descript rules, where argument and “scraps" divided the
honors with strength and pluck. With twenty or more
aside, and no “ beg pardons," it was scarcely a game for
consumptives and weaklings; and, indeed, for many a long
year after the introduction of set rules by Mr. H. C. A.
Harrison (“the father of the Australian game”) and Mr.
T. P. Power, whose photos we reproduce, and their col-
leagues, the strenuous nature of the sport gave force to
the saying so frequently repeated by the old-timers that
“ they were giants in those days!”

informing you that my League have decided
to use only your Kangaroo Brand ” footballs for semi-final, final, and Interstate matches, and,
further, that all balls supplied by us to the schools are to be the same We came to this
decision only after fair trial Your balls have always given us complete satisfaction, and, as
you can guess, school yards are very severe, and we have to give all schools playing the Aus-
tralian game footballs, the boys preferring a “ Slierrin." I might further state that a!! our
clubs use your footballs in inter-club matches, and the general opinion of players of the Aus-
tralian game here is that Sherrin ’s “ Kangaroo ” Brand Football is superior to any other
imported into, or made in, Australia. —Yours faithfully, H. CHESNEY HARTE, Hon. Sec.

A GAME IN THE SIXTIES.
We get an interesting glimpse of the game as it was
played in the early days from the description supplied
by an old lime Ballarat player. Ballarat football was
started in ISOI. with Colonel Greenfield as its first captain.
The Odomd, whose photo will be found in the souvenir,
is still hale :uul hearty. “The first game,” says the nar-
rator, “ was against Geelong in 1862. In those days the

That Mr. Harrison is with tis to-day to witness -the
Jubilee Celebration of bis creative genius in the apotheosis
of the grandest of games gives just that finishing touch
which was needed to render the popular gratification com-
plete. It is given to few men who have rendered a public
service to know and to feel that he carries the united
goodwill and good wishes of some hundreds of thousands
of devotees of the Australian national game, who, week
by week, find just that pleasurable relaxation which is
so essential in the modern busy work-a-day world. The
gre.nest ul democrats, it is said, is he who can level all
c axis in a common enjoyment; and if this he so, then,
above all others, this honor and distinction belongs to
Mr. IF:mi-on as “ the Father of-the Australian Game.”
THE GAME GETS FASTER.
The whole policy of football legislation of late years
has been to make the game faster by bringing everyone
into full play. The introduction of the 'boundary umpires
by the League has immensely improved the game from
a spectacular point of view. Another great, aim lias been

to change all that. Strength gave place to skill; force
and weight were superseded by judgment and resource;
so much so that nowadays the lightest and physically
weakest player on the field has an equal chance with
the heaviest and strongest to turn the tide of victory
in favor of his club. The introduction of “ systems." such
as the, at one time, almost invincible and inimitable
Collingwood " system,” with its passing and exchanges,
long or short, at once placed the heavy bullocking player
at a discount, and necessitated methods with which lie was
quite unacquainted. Combined play came to be regarded
as the keynote of success: and the team which gave the
most studied care to the science of the game found itself
on top most of the time and almost all the time. The
effect of the transition has been as marked as it has proved
popular: whilst the latter-day innovation of expert
“ coaches ” is rapidly' tending towards perfection of the
game. Nowadays, to do his part as it ought to be done,
every member of the team must work in harmony with
the rest, and on a definite system, in all cases subordin-
ating his own methods and personal interests to promote
the general well-being of his side. In another direction,
what an object-lesson this is in that spirit of co-operation
which the progressive Democracy of Australia manifests
in some of its more advanced communal aims and ideal-.

of whom are reproduced in this souvenir, will recall many
a pleasant memory, and suggest, we hope, many a pleasant
quarter hour’s chat respecting the merits of old friends in
the field from the sixties to the present day. It is a far cry
from the seventies, when the sporting scribe wrote —“The
lack of proper grounds set apart and enclosed is one of the
greatest disadvantages under which the game labours. Bowl-
ing has its roods, cricket i'* acres, and racing its hundreds of
acres, but football has imt an inch . d '.and to call its own."
And we read how, on the -’mi of Jmu. )d;~ when .Melbourne
met Hotharn, “an excellent eoiucn was brought to an
abrupt termination by tin utcrb.adiiiient of the spectators in
the second half.”

Melbourne, with T. A. Wills as first captain and H. C. A.
Harrison as his successor, was formed in 1858. "'I he In-
vincible Whites." as they were then called, from .their colours,
carried all before them —with only the South Varra and Rich-
mond clubs to challenge their supremacy. 1 hen, in 1850.
Geelong was established; and. five years later, m 1864, Emer-
ald Hill. Royal Park, and Carlton, with Brunswick. Colling-
wood. University and Williamstown. gave a new impetus to
the game; whilst in 1865 "The Athletic Sports Challenge
up " competition ushered in a brighter era for football, and
called into prominent notice many famous players. Mel-
bourne boasted Harrison, the greatest charger and runner
with the ball of his day; Wardill, the Campbells. Conway,
lleming ("the hero of too goals"), little Tracy, Riggall.
G. Kennedy and Bennie: while South Varra had O'Mullane.
Btidd, Ireland. Freeman ("the indefatigable"). Green,
Wright, and Balcombe. From Carlton came Harry Guy. the
invincible back: Jim Herne. Chadwick, "the skipper."
Lanty " O'Brien, and the two Gormans, Geelong's annals
were already beginning to blaze with the deeds of the bro-
thers Wills. Adams. Rippon. Dickenson, Bowden and Bar-
ker; while University had Geo. Tail. M'Pherson, and Hope,
all grand players.
The winter of 1868 saw another accession to senior rank
in " I he Soldiers," led by Lieut, Xoyes; but above and beyond
all competitors stood Melbourne and Carlton, with organised
scientific play. The struggles between these two clubs in 1861;
are described by the sporting scribe of the day as " eclips-
ing anything yet seen." Melbourne in that year numbered
amongst its champions Harrison (captain). C. Forrester. H.
Goldsmith. Hope and Riggall; while with Carlton there were
Conway (captain), Donovan. Guy, Marshall and Williams.

from the arena of Conway, who had oft led Carlton to vic-
tory, and Harrison, the veteran captain and hero of many
a well-won fight.
The year 1873 in many respects marked a new era. The
old South Yarra, once the glory of football, became a back
number ; St. Kildn, a recent birth, absorbed most of the play-
ers; whilst University dropped out entirely. Esscndon, too,
was established, and commenced that brilliant career which
has always rendered "llu; same old" a {oeman uin'ilr. of die

unsullied banner, and repeated the process in 1874, her cham-

League superseded it, and has since controlled and shaped
the destiny of the pastime.
Of the famous players in the eighties and nineties, and
the inter-club struggles for supremacy, a volume could readily
be written; but it must suffice to mention a few of them. The
enthusiast who glances back will probably name George Coni-

youngsters on the Melbourne Ground is an earnest for
the future of the game across the border when this
younger generation of footballers attains its manhood.
Incidentally, those who look beneath the surface of events
political, will find good reason to hope that this new and
splendid spirit of rivalry in the football arena between the
various State teams may, more speedily and satisfactorily
than any other course, tend to put a period to that pro-
vincial strife which for seven years past has, unhappily,
hampered the realisation of an ideal Federal union.
CHANGES IN RULES AND PLAY.
Though the rules governing the actual play have under-
gone few variations, the evolution of the Australian game
since its inception half a century ago has brought in its
train many important changes, as well from the players’
as from the spectators’ point of view; whilst the scope and

powers and responsibilities of the governing authorities
have been correspondingly widened. For a time com-
petition was limited to Victorian teams; and the game
was admittedly an amateur sport. The advocates of open
professionalism in football, as in cricket, are by no means
few; but he would be a rash prophet who would hazard the
conjecture that professionalism will ever be accepted by
the football loving public, or be sanctioned by the govern-
ing authorities. Public opinion is, however, a curiously
variable quantity.

were the stirring days of vigorous play, productive of
men of nerve and muscle and sinew. And how shall we num-
ber their champions in the contests with Carlton and South
Yarra for pride of place? Particularly in the seventies, when
the “ Invincible White? “ included such players as the Ben-

The Beverage of HEALTH & REFRESHMENT
It cannot be uninteresting- to bring to the notice
of the public the manner in which an article that in
consequence of its particular qualities has obtained
a world-wide reputation, is imitated in one way and
another by a certain class of people, who, by this
means, try to sell such shams to the public.
At our factory we have established an “0.T.”
museum of shams a collection of counterfeit imitations
of this favorite beverage, against which it is necessary
for us to warn the public.
A preparation which has induced so many attempts
at Imitation must be excellent —and you will find it
a distinct advantage to insist on the genuine “ 0.T.”

CARLTON, founded in 1864, deserves a special note,
since at each end of the “ Golden Jubilee ” its banner waves

company of fine, fast and skilled players, whose names need
no mention to establish their popularity, and who. though
playing with perhaps less premiership luck than in the earlier
days, kept Carlton well to the fore. And, to-day, Carlton
stands almost invincible, with two premierships in the last
two seasons; and, shall wc venture to hint it, another in
sight? Let it he freely conceded, too, that the honor and
glory which has fallen to the “ old blues ” in recent years is
due mainly to their chief adviser and general, Mr. Worrall,

It is a far cry from Carlton in 1868 to Carlton in 1908; and
our readers will be interested in comparing the photos, of
the Carlton teams of those two years, as reproduced in this
souvenir,
FITZROY, most brilliant of the later clubs, formed in
1884. is a close relation to Carlton, and has proved itself a
worthy son of a worthy sire. Mr. Jno. M'Mahon, J.P., was
first president, with P. G. M'Shane first contain and J. H.
Simpson first secretary. And with much truth it may be said
that when such noted Carlton cracks as Messrs. Shearwood
and J. F.lliott. and a few others of "the old bines" amalga-
mated with the Xormanby (Junior) K.C. to form the new
combination, the I'itzroy club leapt at once into prominence
to be Minerva full-armed from the head of Jupiter. Mow
great was that prominence, and how splendidly it has been
maintained, is evidenced in the club’s premiershins of 1895,
[B9B. 1899. 1904 and 1905; whilst the names of its most bril-
liant players have become household words in the football
world. Amongst them we may mention, first and foremost.
Jacky " Worrall (the greatest general and organiser the
game has ever known), T Peggs. Rapiport. Rolls. J. Muir,
“Jockey" Pierce, J. Maher and J. Kerrigan, of earlier days;
Con Mickey, P. Hickey, Tom Banks, W. Cleary and Ted
Melling (the "Four Loyalists" who from the 'Bo’s have
stood so steadfastly behind the “ Maroons”), and Jim Grace;
E. Strahan. J. Leckie, Millard, Geoff Moriarty, C. Buckley.
A. B. Sloan, W. Buckley. Leydin, Reynolds and S. M'Michael
of the early '9o's; F. Musgrove and M'Speerin. of the later
'go's; whilst of a host of notables of later and present day
are Mick Grace, W. Potter. 11. Clarke. J. Dalton, P. Des-
crimes, Jenkins, G. Brosnan, Trotter, "Tammy" Beauchamp.
Jim Sharp. Millis, Milne. Bailes and Walker. But to the
provinces the ” Maroons" are abidingly indebted, not only
for their rapid rise to eminence, but for their consistent suc-
cesses, Worrall. Con Hickey, and Banks from Maryborough,
and Cleary from Ballarat, raised Fitzroy to its top and kept
it there. And it is some tribute to Mr. Hickey's sterling
merit that to-day he occupies the proud position of president
of the Australasian Football Council—by universal esteem
and acclaim.
GEELONG, formed m 1859, has worthily upheld the
honour ot provincial football for just on half a century, its

did it secure for the “ Pivotonians ” a succession of premier-
ships, but it taught the metropolitan clubs just what they

successful.
ESSENDON, affectionately known as “ the same old,”
dates back to 1873, with Mr, C. M'Cracken as captain, and
Mr. A. M'Cracken as hon. sec. And, looking back over the

llel the list of famous wearers of the red and black. Other
clubs have experienced their “ ups and downs,” but “ the
same old” from its inception to the present day has, season
by season, produced a succession of really great players, whose

(unequalled before or since as a general), and half a score
more, who gave to Essendon the long list of premiership*
from the early nineties to the beginning of the present de-
cade; while, at the present day, in spite of some recent vicissi-
tudes, we find the same stuff that football champions arc
made of administering the only defeat of the season to the
superb Carlton combination. With such youngsters as Bus-
bridge, Belcher, Dave Smith, Cameron, Landeman, Legge.
Martin, and the two Sheas, anything is possible for “ the
same old.”

Billy Windley. From Ballarat, too, came “ Dinny ” M’Kay
and Harry Purdy, two of South’s best for many a year, and
Peter Burns (“the footballers’ Bhudcla,” as someone has
said). And it is not surprising that, with such notables, and
others of hardly less skill and fame, South has for three de-
cades claimed and secured foremost place in many a hard-
fought final. Nor can we forget the abiding obligation under
which the club rests to its ardent, generous, and genial pre-
sident, Mr. Henry Skinner, whose enthusiasm and wisdom
have consistently combined to place South in the van in
premiership competitions.

ST. KILDA began its career in 1873, anti, despite the
slings and arrows of outrageous fortune in some of its later
years, the seaside club abundantly justifies the splendid pro-
mise of the seventies, when it numbered in its ranks such ex-
ponents as G. Moody (“the Little Wonder”), F. G. Hughes,
C, E. Motile, Geo. Rout, H. Strickland, C. M. Budd, H. Grace',
T. W. C. Riddell, the two Sandilands, Taylor, and J. K.

yards, and second for the Senior Challenge Drop Kick, with
67 yds. 2 ft.). Then there were Stiffe, Alf Smith, “Jigger”

were never excelled as cool, determined, resourceful players.
Of later dale and present day, we mention only a few,
amongst a host of fine players, including “Joe” Hogan

St. Kilda played with indifferent fortune, but for two seasons
past it has been at its best, bidding boldly for first honours,
and with always a big chance of capturing the coveted honour
of premiership.
COLLINGWOOD, too, owes something to the famous

of Carlton, brilliant player and exceptional organiser; whilst,

Of Victorian provincial clubs, their enthusiasm for the
game and the champions they have produced, many happy
reminiscences could be recalled if space would permit. In
Ballarat the first team was formed in 1861, with Colonel
Greenfield (who is still with us) as first captain. We have
already related how the locals met Geelong and played till
dusk: and we may briefly mention a few of the notables
who. from the '7o’s onward, have done battle for the Golden
City, including W. H. Cundy, R. S, Foley, J. Brophy, A.
Wynne ("the \rtftil Dodger”), W. Robertson, J. H. Hosk-
mg, A. I’> Bern (the present president of the Ballarat As-
sociation). J. Coutie, “Dana” Murphy, Geo. M'Kenzie, and
\V Moore Bendigo, too, has given us some remarkably fine
p’ayeis, jum and present; amongst the former we recall
“ Plucky " 1 tonoghue, C. Hunt, the two Jenkinsons, J. Muir,
F, Macoboy, G Wilson, and J. Woods, all of the seventies.

How worthily the game has been upheld in the sister States
is seen in the records of the visiting teams to the Jubilee Car-
nival. Pride of place may be assigned ungrudgingly to the
famous Norwood club, “the champions of the South,’' with
a long list of premiership honours and players who are num-
bered with Australia’s very best. It is almost invidious to
particularise, but let us recall just a few of them in Messrs.

To Tasmania we owe many a notable player, most prominent
being Fred M’Ginis (the personification of resource, skill,
and endurance), who afterwards played for Melbourne, the
original ‘‘Joker” Hall (who migrated to Essendon). the
Kadys (all bom footballers), Vautin, J. Ryan, K. Burn, Watt,
and Mick M‘Leod. Nor are Westralia and New South Wales
less fortunate in the possession of skilled and strenuous
players. We reproduce the Perth club (1907 premiers of
W.A.), and the N.S.W, Inter-State teams of 1881 and 1905.
both of which included brilliant and consistent ’bailers: and
it is specially gratifying to record that the enterprise and
enthusiasm of these two States have in past years furnished
teams of "young Australians” who, on the Melbourne ground,
have shown their sterling merit against the pick of our Vic-
torian youngsters. In that lies the greatest hope for the
future of the game.
Even upon so necessarily short a review as this, is it any
wonder that the remarkable evolution of our grand game has
excited the admiration of the Australian sport-loving public?
The performances of the past, great as they were, are quite
eclipsed by those of the present day; whilst each new im-
provement in method and rule gives still further promise of
a game which shall in the near future become unique through-
out the King’s dominions, by virtue of its skill and universal
popularity.

in Victoria the interests and control of the game are en-

And in each of the sister States similar bodies exercise similar
governing authority. Then, again, the formation of the Aus-
tralian Football Council, in 1906. representative of each State,
was a distinctly forward step in a very desirable direction.
For example, it is now a guarantee that the Rules of the
game will not be subject to alteration unless such alteration

Slates represented thereon. That the new Council has
abundantly justified its existence is manifest from the present

the Golden Jubilee of the game. And it is especially note-
worthy, as a happy augury for the future, that all the Aus-
tralian States and Xew Zealand are meeting in conclave to

Where shall we go for a change of Beer ?
’Tis a question that’s asked each day in the year.
Some go to one Pub, some go to another,
But go where you will it is hard to discover
Where you can get it clear, sparkling and new,
Where you can get it of the very best brew.
That question’s now settled, and settled right well,
There’s only one place, “ Her Majesty’s Hotel.”
