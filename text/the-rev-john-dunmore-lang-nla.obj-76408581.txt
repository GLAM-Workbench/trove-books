reflecting upon the judge and jury. The result
was a prosecution of the editor for contempt of
court, and Mr. Bull was[sentenced to pay a fine
of �lOO, and to be imprisoned until the fine
was paid. A general feeling of indignation
was ropsod by these proceedings, and the
amount qf the line was collected in a few
hours.
The troubles of Dr. Lang, as a writer for tho
Press, did not end here. In an article upon
? Missions to the Aborigines,? be severely
bandied the Rev. Mr. Threlkeld, who thereupon
brought an action for libel against him, claim-
ing �lOOO damages. Mr. Threlkeld was accused
of extravagance and wastefulness of the funds

Lang was elected by a large majority over his
opponent, the pro-transportation candidate. He
presented a petition to the Council against
transportation, signed by upwards of 36,500
persons. The petition presented in favour of
it had only 525 signatures ! An address from
the Legislative Council was sent to her
Majesty against the revival of transportation,
and the result was that the Order in Council
re-establishing it was revoked. Port Phillip
took an active and energetic part in the same
agitation, and insisted upon a vessel which had
arrived from England with convicts being sent
on to Sydney. Soon afterwards the province
was separated from New South Wales, and
created an independent colony, under the title
of Victoria.
After Dr. Lang?s election for Sydney, he
moved that a select committee be appointed for
the purpose of inquiring into the charges made
against him by Earl Grey. The Legislative
Council at that time contained a number of
members to whom Dr. Lang, his politics, and
his outspoken opinions, were peculiarly ob-
noxious. They were glad of the opportunity
to humiliate and punish the popular idol. Dr.
Lang?s motion was negatived,f and the resolu-
tions were passed by 13 members condemning
his conduct in the introduction of immigrants
into Queensland upon the Land Order system.
He thereupon announced his determination to
resign his seat in Parliament; but the public
were not -willing C . ae� him sacrificed to the
hostility of the anti-popular party. At a very
largo public meeting in Sydney resolutions
were passed condemnatory of the unfair
conduct of the Legislative Council, which
judged and condemned him without a
fair trial, expressing the utmost confidence in
his integrity, and requesting him to retain his
seat. After this expression of public opinion
in his favour, ho retained his seat, and among
the measures for which he voted was a new
Electoral Act, considerably extending the fran-
chise.
It was not likely that Dr. Lang would allow
his enemies in the Council to escape scot-
free, after their attempt to ruin him as a
public man. They knew the man they
had to deal with, and must have expected
reprisals. He took more signal vengeance
than even they expected. In a series of sketches
under the heading of the ? Deil?s Dozen,? he
pilloried the most prominent of them by nar-
rating their colonial career, and showing how
some of them, who presumed to condemn him
unheard, had accumulated their wealth. An
extraordinary sensation was caused, and one of
the persons attacked prosecuted Dr. Lang cri-
minally for libel. After a trial, in which the
then Chief Justice, Sir Alfred Stephen, was
charged with showing considerable animus
against him, he was found guilty and sentenced
to imprisonment for four months in Parramatta
Gaol, and to pay a fine of �lOO. The fine was
at once collected in shilling subscriptions.
Whatever were the merits of the case, whether
the plaintiff was falsely accused or not, there
can be no doubt that public sympathy was with
Dr. Lang. He suffered very little inconvenience
from his confinement in gaol, where he was
comfortably lodged, and where he was visited
by large numbers of his friends.
The public very shortly after showed what
was their opinion of the matter by electing him
at the head of the poll for Sydney in the gene-
ral election of 1851. The other two members
were Mr. John Lamb and the veteran politician
Mr. Wentworth. He did not enjoy his legisla-
tive honors long, for finding himself threatened
with legal proceedings for obligations incurred
in sending immigrants to Queensland, he re-
signed his seat, and went to England on his
seventh visit. He returned to the colony at the
end of 1853, and was elected for a Queensland
constituency, with the 1 object of assisting to
obtain the separation of that colony from New
South Wales. On the departure of Sir Charles
Fitzroy, the Governor, from the colony, the
usual address to him was moved in the Council.
Dr. Lang thereupon moved an amendment, re-
flecting in severe terms upon his administration
of public affairs and upon the scandals of his
private life. The amendment was supported
by many of the most eminent men in the
House, including Messrs. Cowper and Parkes,
but it was of course negatived.
At the general election in 1855 he stood for
West Sydney, and was returned at the head of
the poll, with three others, as a supporter of
Mr. Cowper. Again, in 1860, he was retained
at the head of the poll, Mr. Windeyer being
one of bis colleagues. In 1861 he went to
England without resigning his seat, to prosecute
an appeal to the Privy Council in the litigation
concerning the Church property. In 1864 he
was again returned for West Sydney, with
three others, this time polling 22 votes less
than Mr., now Sir John, Robertson, who was at
the head of the poll. He continued to discharge
the duties as member until the end of that
Parliament, in 1869 ; but he did not afterwards
offer himself for re-election. During his long
and active career as a representative, he identi-
fied himself with liberal and progressive legis-
lation in the best sense. He assisted in the ex-
tension of the franchise at a time when man-
hood suffrage was regarded with distrust. He
also contended for the equalising of representa-
tion, and was in favour of triennial parlia-
ments. He was, of course, opposed to State
aid to religion, and in favour of national
education. He supported liberal land
legislation and cheap railway communication.
The services that he has rendered Australia as a
politician are only inferior?if, indeed, they are
at all inferior?to those ho rendered as a colo-
nizer. An ardent lover of liberty, thoroughly
patriotic, and a strong believer in the capacity
of the people for self-government, he fired tho
minds of young Australians with his own
aspirations. Ho foresaw that Australia was
destined to become a great brotherhood of
nations, and he devoted his life to the
great work of laying the foundation well and
truly. He stood in the foremost rank with the
greatest of the politicians of New South Wales
with Wentworth and Lowe ; again,
with Cowper and Martin, and then with Parkes
and Robertson. Whilst he rivalled the best of
those men in their mental gifts, he excelled
them all in the purity and unselfishness of hia
motives. No other man in Australia has
achieved so much, or made such sacrifices, in
the service of his country. Although a great
political leader, he had no party but the people.
He was outside the struggles of those seeking
for office, for it does not seem that he had any
desire for it; and he was therefore removed from
the petty party considerations and strife which
demoralize political life.
Although Dr. Lang was the fowider of the Pres-
byterian Church in New South Wales, his rela-
tions with the Presbyterian body were not very
harmonious. It is very much to be regretted that
the differences between Dr. Lang and his brother
members of the Church took place, for unques-
tionably they injured the Church and ruined the
College, which had achieved a large amount of
success. The disagreement came at length to an
open rupture in 1842. The Synod censured him
for ? contumacious contempt of the authority of
the Churchand he, in return, denounced them
in strong tonus. He sent in a letter of,,
resignation, which they refused to receive, and
a majority of the Synod voted for his deposition.
This extreme course was confirmed by the Church
Courts in Scotland with unseemly haste and want
of deliberation. The Presbytery of Irvine,
which had ordained Dr. Lang, confirmed it,
as did also the General Assembly, who re-
futed to entertain his appeal. Dr. Lang
appealed to the Presbytery of Irvine to have
their decision rescinded, on the ground that
he had not been heaid in bis own defence. Tho
Presbytery declined, and their action was again
confirmed by the General Assembly. Dr. Lang
then commenced an action against the Presbytery
in the Court af Sessions, and the Lord Ordinary?
Lord Jarvisford?decided in his favour, holding
that the decision was illegal, having been come ta
in his absence, and without hearing him. Tte
deposition was, therefore, annulled both by She
Presbytery of Irvine and by the General Assembly.,

stood by him in his arduous battle of life, were
nearly all the distinguished men of the colony, its
leading politicians, divines, civic authorities,
merchants, and men of mark. Many qf those had
often waged fierce war with the dead chieftain;
hut their differences had been healed or were
forgotten at his grave. Most of the Ministers
were present, as also Sir Henry Parkes, Sir John
Robertson, the Hon. Sir John Hay, president of
the Council; the Hon. Sir George W. Allen,
Speaker of the Assembly; Very Rev. Dean
Cowper; Rev. J. Adam, Moderator of General
Assembly, &c. The Rev. P. F. Mackenzie (Dr.
Lang?s son-in-law), in the course of the few
remarks he made, said ? When he looked at the
coifin containing the earthly remains before them,
he could not hut remember the words of the Earl
of Moreton as he stood by the grave of John
Knox, the champion of the Scottish Reformation :
? Here lies one who never feared the face of man.? ?
There were upwards of 3,000 persons in the funeral
procession, and more than 70,000 lined the route
to the graveyard in Devonshire-street. Every
window and balcony, and even the roofs of many
houses, were crowded with spectators. In the
procession, which was fully a mile long,'went first
800 Chinamen, in gratelul leougultiuu of Ur.
Lang?s services in securing the repeal of the poll
tax ; and a very large number of persons went on
foot. Among the carriages were those of His
Excellency the Governor and the Chief Justice.
After the clergymen had performed their religious
offices at the grave, Sir John Robertson, who had
been requested to address a few words to those
present, stepped forward, and In brief and fitting
terms bore his testimony?the testimony of his
lifetime?to the goodness and tho noble qualities
of the deceased. And thus, with loving reverence,
were tho mortal remains of the greatest man
Australia has yet produced committed to the dust. I
Dr. Lang, as a public speaker, stood in the fore-
most rank among the public men of his time, and
was no unworthy rival of W. O. Wentworth and
Robert Lowe. With less of passionate declama-
tory power than the great Australian statesman,
and inferior to the distinguished orator of the
House of Commons in clear and logical argument
and brilliancy of diction, he surpassed both in the
loftier aims he had, and in the wonderful amount
of knowledge he possessed. His speaking was
characterised by great power and earnestness, full
of apt quotations and illustrations drawn from the
classics or from modem literature, and diversified
with witty and humorous remarks, and quaint and
laughable anecdotes told in the happiest manner.
Many instances will he remembered of his smart- I
ness at repartee, which there is not space in this I
article to notice. At one meeting on the transpor- I
tation question, when he rose to speak, he was met I
by a Babel of roars, groans, and hisses from a I
portion of the theatre in which the meeting was
held, on his left hand. By a happy reference |
to the old Roman superstition that thunder on j
the left was a favourable prognostic, he got the
audience into good humour. ? Intomit Icevum, it I
thunders on the left?a good omen,? said he, and I
was no further seriously interrupted. A writer in I
the press has spoken of his ?ponderous sentences, I
delivered with slow utterance in strong Scotch I
accent.? The first portion of this remark is a criti- I
cism of Dr. Lang?s speaking at its worst; the I
latter is not true, for his English was remarkably I
good, and the Scotch accent was hardly notice- I
able.

THB ATTENTION
Actively engaged as Dr. Lang was in the work
of colonization, in politics, and in his ministra-
tions, he yet found time to write and publish a
considerable number of books. His ? History of
New South Wales? has had four editions, the last
in 1875. Besides this, he published ? The Origin-
ation and Migrations of the Polynesian Nations,?
in 1834 ; ? Transportation and Colonization,? in
1837; ?New Zealand,? in 1839; ?Religion and
Education in America,? in 1840 ; ? Cooksland and
Phillipsland,? in 1847; ?Freedom and Indepen-
dence for Australia,? in 1852 ; and ? The Coming
Event,? in 1870. At an early period of his colo-
nial career, he published ?Aurora Australis,? a
volume of poems partly sacred.
His family consisted of 10 children, seven of
whom are dead ; and there remain a son and two
daughters, the eldest married to the Rev. P. P.
Mackenzie. Dr. Lang?s personal appearance'in?
dicated great physical and mental energy. He
was over six feet in height, stout, and inclined to
corpulency. He was of fair complexion, with
prominent features, and an animated, pleasant
look. His head was large and remarkable for its j
length,
A large number of interesting anecdotes could
be recorded about Dr. Lang. The following will
show how widely known and deeply respected his
name was, even among the worst members of
society. He was travelling in a coach in New
South Wales, when it was stuck-up, and the
passengers robbed. Dr. Lang was ordered to pull
off his boots like the others, and, while obeying
mildly remonstrated against such treatment of I
him. ? And who are you f? said one of the des-
