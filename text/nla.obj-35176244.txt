Description of a New Species of Dacelo from North-western
Australia. By John Gould, F.R.S., Y.P.Z.S., &c.
I have long; had in ray collection a pair of a species of Dacelo which
I could not satisfactorily determine ; but not having a sufficient series
of Dacelo cervina for comparison, I have hesitated to describe it as
new. Having, however, recently obtained several examples of the
last-named bird, I find that the species from North-western Aus-
tralia is quite distinct, and I therefore propose for it the name of
Dacelo occidentalis, sp. Nov.
D. affinis D. cervinse sed diversa, rostra multo robustiore, colori-
bus pallidioribus, et prcecipue pogonio externo rectricis extima
conspicue albo fasciato distinguenda.
Long, tot. 16‘0, rostri 3’2, al. 7'5, caud, 4'5 poll. Angl.
