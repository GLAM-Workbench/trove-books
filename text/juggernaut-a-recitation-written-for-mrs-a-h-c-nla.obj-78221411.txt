JUGGERNAUT.
Written for Mrs A. H. CLARKE.
J. F5. CARTP2R, Melbourne,
What day is this ! On which the sun rolls out
In all his splendour thro? an Orient sky,
And all the air is redolent of song,
And every thought is voiced in holy prayer ?
It is the day on which great India?s God
Comes forth to greet the faithful of the earth ;
To winwow up the fruits of faith and fear,
Sown by his priests all thro? the past gone year.
What means this throng ? Ten thousand frenzied
Frantic with faith ! No atom less inspired
Than pious pilgrims to Mahomet?s tomb ;
Or iron-mailed Crusader for Holy Grail.


See ! Towering o?er that cloud of desert dust
Into the clearer sky, a temple?s height ;
All golden ; flashing back the sun?s bright rays
From myriad jewels crowded into space.
It moves ! It comes ! Drawn by a human team
A thousand strong ; erstwhile the maddened crowd
Struggling and fighting for the place of first
Who falls beneath its hundred crushing wheels,
Seeks but to grasp the holy cord of grace
Which gives to him who gains it, pardon free,
And right to pour his treasures to the God,
Or throw his life beneath the heavenly mill.
Slowly it comes?o?er sand and martyrs crushed,
A moving temple with its doors thrown wide,
And there within?the awful Deity?
A giant, graven image, on a throne.
And here a woman presses through the crowd,
With voice imperious?a Princess she?
No need of diadem to tell her place :
Royal in form?in mien?in queenly grace.
Grief is her crown now?Love has set it there,
The sceptre that she holds is in her arms,
No lovelier jewel ever mother wore :
No heavier sorrow ever woman bore.


No sin has she?no fault to expiate,
But throws herself before the moving mass,
And holding up the babe to Vishnu?s face
Gives forth this prayer in all her pagan grace .
? Oh, Vishnu ! great and vengeful God,
Be thou appeased by all this sacrifice,
And give me back my love.
Oh, Vishnu ! great in all that Gods are great,
Stop in thy path and grant one earthly boon :
My lord, a soldier Prince, wounded,
A captive in the foeman?s hands,
Doomed as a sacrifice to offer thee.
Restore to me my love, and give to these,
His people?back their King?
That he may weave Thy glory with their victory.
Take thou instead this pledge of holy faith,
1 hat I may hope to thus appease thy ire ;
Or grant me death upon his funeral pyre.?
And thus she kneels while waiting the approach
Of all that throng with mighty Vishnu?s car,
Still clasping closely in her heart?s great love,
The price she?d give to ?vert its father?s doom.
? Hold ! woman, hold ! Go place thy trust in Christ
(So speaks a Nun in garb of charity).
And he will take thy child unto His arms,
And soothe thy grief-torn heart in heavenly rest.


? Thy faith is great, thy wedded love is strong,
Such faith as thine should rest on Calvary ;
The Christian?s God needs no such sacrifice
From those who bear His cross and do His will.'
?And strangle the belief that from my birth
I?ve drank with mother?s milk ? And be accursed
By priest and clan?and leave my soul a dearth
Of any faith ! What giv?st thou me instead ? ?
ï¿½ *
? A faith that needs no living sacrifice,
? His yoke is easy, and the burden light,?
He stills the wind unto the lamb that?s shorn,
And bears the load of all to trouble born.?
* *
? How small is virtue without sacrifice.
Who cares for gem that costs but little price ?
I ask no mercy, but my faith to prove
The ransom that shale bring me back my i
With this she lays her offering on the ground
With eyes avert : She hears the crushing wheels
Grind out the life that from her heart she?d given
And shrieking, fell?a heathen bride of Heaven.
