“And I said to the man who stood at
the sate of the year: Give me a light
that I may tread safely into the unknown
And he replied ;
“Go out into the darkness and tut
your hand into the Hand of God. That
shall be to you better than light and safer
than a known way.”

HYMN: “Abide With Me”
1 Abide with me; fast falls the even-
tide;
The darkness deepens; Lord, with
me abide!
When other helpers fail, and com-
forts flee,
Help of the helpless, O abide with
me.
2 Swift to its close ebbs out life’s
little day;
Earth’s joys grow dim, its glories
pass away;
Change and decay in all around
I see:
O Thou who changest not, abide
with me!
5 Hold Thou Thy
closing eyes;
Tune\ “Eventide”
3 I need Thy presence every passing-
hour;
What but Thy grace can foil the
tempter’s power?
Who like Thyself my guide and stay
can be ?
Through cloud and sunshine, O
abide with me.
4 I fear no foe, with Thee at hand
to bless;
Ills have no weight, and tears no
bitterness;
Where is death’s sting? where,
grave, thy victory?
I triumph still, if Thou abide with
me.

In life, in death, O Lord, abide with
me!

HYMN
Tune\ “Crimond ”
1 The Lord’s my shepherd, I’ll not
want,
3 Yea, though I walk in death’s dark
vale,
He makes me down to He
Yet will I fear none ill:
In pastures green: he leadeth me
The quiet waters by.
For thou art with me; and thy rod
And staff me comfort still.
2 My soul he doth restore again;
And me to walk doth make
4 My table thou hast furnished
In presence of my foes;
Within the paths of righteousness
E’en for his own name’s sake.
My head thou dost with oil anoint,
And my cup overflows.
S Goodness and mercy all my life
Shall surely follow me:
And in God’s house for evermore
My dwelling-place shall be.

HYMN
1 What service shall we render thee
O Fatherland we love?
What gift of hand, or heart, or brain
May our devotion prove?
The coming age invokes our aid,
Thy voice of old inspires;
Shall we, thy sons and daughters, be
Less worthy than our sires ?
2 The service of the commonwealth
Is not in arms alone;
A nobler chivalry shall rise
Than war has ever known;
Glad rivalries in arts of peace,
True ministries of life,
Shall supersede the arts of war
And calm our feverish strife.

People: And let our cry come unto thee.

3 Too long the pagan rule of force
Has held the world in thrall,
Too long the clash of arms has
drowned
O comrades, seek a nobler quest!
O keep a worthier tryst!
The laws of hate have had their day;
Proclaim the laws of Christ!
4 Lord of the nations, far and near,
Send forth Thy quickening breath,
Equip us for the tasks of life,
Save us from deeds of death;
Enlist us in Thy ranks to fight
Fair freedom’s holy war.
Whose battle-cry is Brotherhood,
Far-flung from shore to shore.
