>j(he question of Federation and Intercolonial
Free Trade is of vital importance to the Vine-
growers of South Australia?more so than to any other
producers, as it must create outlets for the Wines,
Brandies, Raisins, and Currants in colonies where the
Vine is not grown to any great extent.
It therefore becomes the duty of every Member of
the above Association not only to vote for Federation,
but to endeavour to induce all in his power?and more
especially those employed by him ?to record their votes
in its favour and to afford them every facility in so
doing.
The Council wish to impress on all Vinegrowers
that extended Markets must mean improved prices,
and the employment of more labour.

Secretary,
