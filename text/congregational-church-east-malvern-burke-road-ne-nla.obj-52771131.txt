OUR FIRST CHURCH
This is the original Church in which the pioneers
of this Congregational Christian Fellowship met for
Worship in the year 1890,
The Church was then situated in Kilpatrick's
paddock, in Waverley Road.
After a hard struggle for 15 years, it was decided
to remove the Church building to a better site.
In 1905 a portion of our present site, in Burke
Road, was purchased, and the weatherboard Church
was removed to the new site, In the new situation,
the Church advanced, and in 1907, two years later,
it was found necessary to add two rooms to the rear
of the Church building, for use as Class rooms.
Further progress was made and, to meet the needs
of the youth activities, two additional rooms were
added in 1910.


THE NEW CHURCH
The continued progress of the Church, with its
increasing Sunday School and youth activities,
created the urgent necessity for a larger and separate
building to be used for Worship.
With vision and sacrifice, the Church decided that
the building erected must be worthy of our God,
and one of which the Church and the denomination
would be proud.
The plans for this beautiful building were
prepared and accepted.
The Congregational Union of Victoria came to the
aid of the Church with a generous loan, by means
of which the great enterprise was undertaken.
The new Church building was opened on Septem-
ber 2, 1916, The Dedication Address was given by
the Rev, A. Depledge Sykes, of Collins Street.
Others who took part in the Service were Revs,
A. S. Devenlsh, W. L. Gloss, J, W. Jones and the
Minister of the Church, Rev. R. K. Felstead.


THE WHARINGTON HALL
The Church had made further progress, and the Sunday School
under Mr. Alfred M. Wharington, who, for 25 years, was the
beloved and most efficient Superintendent, had grown to such an
extent that it could not be accommodated with comfort in the old
building. The Sunday School Anniversaries wore an over-
increasing problem, A new, and a much larger, building was
urgenlly needed.
Mr. Wharinglon dreamed of lire day when he would see the
Sunday School adequately accommodated. There was a big debt
on the Church, and to build a School Hall would greatly increase
the burden on [hose who were already carrying a big burden,
Mr. Wharinglon did not live to aoo the realization of his dream
of a new Hall, for,- on the Sunday School Picnic Day, November 1,
1921, ho passed on suddenly.
Mr. Wharington, however, had made some provision for the
Hall, for ho left the Church some valuable land, which ha wished
to be sold, and the proceeds to be used to purchase the
additional land on which the Hall was to be erected, and the
balance to be placed to the Hall Fund,
Again the Congregational Union came to the assistance of the
Church with a loan of £BOO, and a further £1,200 was borrowed
from the Ministers' Provident Fund. To perpetuate the memory
of the beloved Superintendent and benefactor, the new hall was
named The Wharington Hall.
The Memorial Stone was laid by Mrs, A, M, Wharinglon on
February 11, 1928.
Last year, 1949, we made the final payment on the -Hall Debt.
The Rev, F. A. Forward was the Minister when the Hall
was erected.
