OCTOBER 1888.
hdHHHHh4- W" #
Tune “ Shiloh,” 222 Psalmist.
0 RAISE the joyful chorus,
With thankful hearts draw near,
Our Jubilee to welcome,
The Lord’s accepted year.
We raise our joyous chorus,
With thanks, 0 Lord, to Thee,
For Thou the year hast given,
The year of Jubilee.
For all the past so loving,
For all Thy present grace,
For brightening hope and promise,
The shining of Thy face.
In days of want or weakness,
Thine arm hath brought us aid ;
In nights of doubt and darkness,
Thy smile illumes the shade.
Thou wilt direct our future,
We trust in Thee alone;
The God who thus has blessed us,
Will still preserve His own.
Guide us, we humbly pray Thee,
Along that sacred road,
That leads, through earthly service,
Up to the rest of God.
Each year of glad progression,
Has shown us more of Thee:
Then, with Thy gracious presence,
Now crown our Jubilee.
Thus, from each distant island,
And earth’s remotest shore ;
We join glad hearts and voices:
Praise God for evermore.
Mrs. Sevan.
Tune “ Harlan,” 131 Bristol Tune Book.
SOLEMNLY, joyfully
Lift we our song to Thee ;
Father Divine.
Thou gav’st the noble thought,
Now to fruition brought;
Praise shall be Thine.
Solemn our song to-day:
Comrades who passed away,
Tender and true;
Who in our labour shared,
Now that we reap reward,
Join with us too.
Joyous our song shall be:
This song of Jubilee,
Of labour done:
Joyous to see at last
All our best hopes surpassed—
Victory won.
Solemn : the future stands,
Calling with beck’ning hands, —
Whither away ?
What unknown peril lies
Hid in our destinies,
Ah ! who can say.
Joyous : whate’er befall,
Nought shall our souls appal,—
God is our friend.
He whose unsleeping care
All our past lives declare,
Loves to the end.
Solemnly, joyfully
Lift we our song to Thee,
Father Divine.
Thou gav’st the noble thought,
Now to fruition brought,
Praise shall be Thine.
Rev. W. Allen.


XII.
Tune “ Banias,” 500 Psalmist.
0 MASTER, it is good to be
High on the mountain here with Thee;
Here, in an ampler purer air,
Above the stir of toil and care ;
Of hearts distract with doubt and grief,
Believing in their unbelief,
Calling Thy servants all in vain
To ease them of their bitter pain.
0 Master, it is good to be
With Thee and with Thy faithful three
Here, where the Apostle’s heart of rock
Is nerved against temptation’s shock;
Here, where the Son of Thunder learns
The thought that breathes, and word that
burns ;
Here, where on eagles’ wings we move
With Him Whose last best creed is Love.
0 Master, it is good to be
Entranced, enwrapt alone with Thee;
And watch Thy glistering raiment glow
Whiter than Hermon’s whitest snow;
The human lineaments that shine
Irradiant with a light divine,
Till we two change from grace to grace,
Gazing on that transfigured face.
0 Master, it is good to be
Here on the Holy Mount with Thee ;
When darkling in the depths of night,
When dazzled with excess of light,
We bow before the heavenly Voice
That bids bewildered souls rejoice;
Though love wax cold and faith be dim,
“ This is My Son ! oh, hear ye Him! ”
I-v.
Tone “ Holley,” 409 Psalmist.
A VOICE upon the midnight air,
Where Kedron’s moonlit waters stray,
Weeps forth in agony of prayer,
“ 0 Father ! take this cup away.”
Ah ! Thou Who sorrowest unto death,
We conquer in Thy mortal fray ;
And earth for all her children saith,
O God! take not this cup away.
O Lord of sorrow ! meekly die :
Thou’lt heal or hallow all our woe ;
Thy name refresh the mourner’s sigh,
Thy peace revive the faint and low.
Great Chief of faithful souls, arise !
None else can lead the martyr-band,
Who teach the brave how peril flies,
When Faith, unarmed, uplifts the hand.
0 King of Earth ! the Cross ascend ;
O’er climes and ages ’tis Thy throne ;
Where’er Thy fading eye may bend,
The desert blooms, and is Thine own.
Thy parting blessing, Lord, we pray ;
Make but one fold below, above ;
And when we go the last lone way,
O give the welcome of Thy love.
Tune “ Pleyel,” 138 Psalmist.
11AKE my life, and let it be
Consecrated, Lord, to Thee;
Take my moments and my days,
Let them flow in ceaseless praise.
Take my hands, and let them move
At the impulse of Thy love ;
Take my feet and let them be
Swift and beautiful for Thee.
Take my voice, and let me sing,
Always, only, for my King ;
Take my lips, and let them be
Filled with messages from Thee.
Take my silver and my gold,
Not a mite would I withhold;
Take my intellect, and use
Every power as Thou shalt choose.
Take my will, and make it Thine;
It shall be no longer mine ;
Take my heart, it is Thine own ;
It shall be Thy royal throne.
Take my love, my Lord, I pour
At Thy feet its treasure store;
Take myself, and I will be
Ever, only, all for Thee.
VI.
Tune “ Jarrow,” 488 Psalmist.
rr HE Son of God goes forth to war,
JL A kingly crown to gain;
His blood-red banner streams afar ;
Who follows in His train ?
Who best can drink His cup of woe,
Triumphant over pain,
Who patient bears His cross below,
He follows in His train.


The myrter first, whose eagle eye
Could pierce beyond the grave,
Who saw his Master in the sky,
And called on Him to save :
Like Him, with pardon on His tongue,
In midst of mortal pain,
He prayed for them that did the wrong :
Who follows in His train ?
A glorious band, the chosen few
On whom the Spirit came,
Twelve valiant saints, their hope they knew,
And mocked the cross and flame:
They met the tyrant’s brandished steel,
The lion’s gory mane,
They bowed their necks, the death to feel!
Who follows in their train ?
A noble army —men and hoys,
The matron and the maid,
Around the Saviour’s throne rejoice,
In robes of light arrayed :
They climbed the steep ascent of heaven,
Through peril, toil, and pain :
0 God, to us may grace be given
To follow in their train.
"VII.
Tune “ St. Gertrude,” 439 Bristol Tune Book.
OiIWAIiD be our watchword,
Steps and voices joined ;
Seek the things before us,
Not a look behind;
Burns the fiery pillar
At our army’s head ;
Who shall dream of shrinking,
By our Captain led ?
Forward through the desert,
Through the toil and fight;
Jordon flows before us,
Sion beams with light.
Forward, when in childhood
Buds the infant mind;
All through youth and manhood,
Not a thought behind ;
Speed through realms of nature,
Climb the steps of grace;
Faint not till in glory
Gleams our Father’s face.
Forward, all the lifetime,
Climb from height to height;
Till the head be hoary,
Till the eve be light.
Forward, flock of Jesus,
Salt of all the earth,
Till each yearning purpose
Spring to glorious birth ;
Sick, they ask for healing,
Blind, they grope for day ;
Pour upon the nations
Wisdom’s loving ray.
Forward, out of error,
Leave behind the night;
Forward through the darkness,
Forward into light.
Glories upon glories
Hath our God prepared,
By the souls that love Him
One day to be shared :
Eye hath not beheld them,
Ear hath never heard ;
Nor of these hath uttered
Thought or speech a word;
Forward, ever forward,
Clad in armour bright;
Till the veil be lifted,
Till our faith he sight.
Far o’er yon horizon
Eise the city towers,
Where our God abideth,
That fair home is ours :
Flash the streets with jasper,
Shine the gates with gold:
Flows the gladdening river
Shedding joys untold.
Thither, onward thither,
In the Spirit’s might;
Pilgrims to your country,
Forward into light.
To the Eternal Father
Loudest anthems raise :
To the Son and Spirit
Echo songs of praise :
To the Lord of Glory,
Blessed Three in One,
Be by men and angels
Endless honour done.
Weak are earthly praises,
Dull the songs of night :
Forward into triumph,
Forward into light!


VIII
Tune “ Barton,” 440 Psalmist.
0 HAPPY band of pilgrims,
If onward ye will tread,
With Jesus as your Fellow,
To Jesus as your Head ;
0 happy, if ye labour
As Jesus did for men ;
0 happy, if ye hunger
As Jesus hungered then.
The Cross that Jesus carried,
He carried as your due ;
The Crown that Jesus weareth,
He weareth it for you.
The trials that beset you,
The sorrows ye endure,
The manifold temptations
That death alone can cure, —
What are they but His jewels,
Of right celestial worth ?
What are they but the ladder
Set up to heaven, on earth?
O happy band of pilgrims,
Look upward to the skies,
Where sirch a light affliction
Shall win you such a prize.
IX.
Tune “ Bath,” 463 Bristol Tune Booh.
IAEIEND after friend departs ;
_ Who hath not lost a friend ?
There is no union here of hearts,
That finds not here an end :
Were this frail world our only rest,
Living or dying, none were blest,
Beyond the flight of time,
Beyond this vale of death,
There surely is some blessed clime,
Where life is not a breath,
Nor life’s affections transient fire,
Whose sparks fly upwards to expire.
There is a world above,
Where parting is unknown;
A whole eternity of love,
Form’d for the good alone :
And faith beholds the dying here
Translated to that happier sphere.
Thus star by star declines
Till all are passed away,
As morning high and higher shines
To pure and perfect day ;
Nor sink those stars in empty night;
They hide themselves in heaven’s own
light.
Tune “ Aurelia,” 415 Psalmist.
LOED of the living harvest,
That whitens o’er the plain,
Where angels soon shall gather
Their sheaves of golden grain ;
Accept these hands to labour,
These hearts to trust and love,
And deign with them to hasten
Thy kingdom from above.
As labourers in Thy vineyard,
Send us out, Christ, to be
Content to bear the burden
Of weary days for Thee.
We ask no other wages,
When Thou shalt call us home,
But to have shared the travail
Which makes Thy kingdom come.
0 come, Thou Holy Spirit,
And fill our souls with light ;
Clothe us in spotless raiment,
In linen clean and white;
Within Thy sacred temple
Be with us, where we stand,
And sanctify Thy people
Throughout this happy land.
Be with us, God the Father,
Be with us, God the Son,
Be with us, God the Spirit,
0 blessed Three in One !
Make us a royal priesthood,
Thee rightly to adore,
And fill us with Thy fulness,
Now, and for evermore.
XI.
Tune “ Melcombe,” 78 Psalmist.
OTHOU, to Whom in ancient time
The lyre of Hebrew bards was strung
Whom kings adored in song sublime,
And prophets praised with glowing tongue ;
Not now on Zion’s height alone,
Thy favoured worshippers may dwell,
Nor where at sultry noon Thy Son
Sat weary by the patriarch’s well;
From every place below the skies,
The grateful song, the fervent prayer,
The incense of the heart may rise
To heaven, and find acceptance there.
To Thee shall age with snowy hair,
And strength and beauty bend the knee
And childhood lisp, with reverent air,
Its praises and its prayers to Thee.
0 Thou, to Whom, in ancient time,
The lyre of prophet bards was strung,
To Thee at last, in every clime,
Shall temples rise, and praise be sung.


XII.
Tune “ Missionary,” 286 Psalmist.
FAR off our brethren’s voices
Are borne from distant lands,
Far off our Father’s children
Reach out their waiting hands.
“ Give us,” they cry, “ our portion;
Co-heirs of grace divine !
Give us the Word of promise,
On us may glory shine.”
Yea, though the world of waters
Between us ever rolls,
No ocean wastes may sever
The brotherhood of souls ;
Far from us, they are of us ;
No bound of all the earth
May part the sons and daughters
Who share the second birth.
One standard floats above us ;
One old historic throne,
In nearness or in distance,
One loyal faith we own ;
So in the things eternal
Adore we at one shrine,
And with the nation’s banner
Rear we the Church’s sign.
In happiest homely commune,
When sweetest songs are sung,
Awakes those alien echoes
One sacred mother-tongue.
Then let us praise together !
Together let its pray,
And go together homeward
Upon the ancient way.
Together, heavenward, homeward;
For ever in our view
One spiritual city—
Jerusalem the New;
For ever drawing nearer
To One beloved, adored,
The Crucified Who bought us,
The crowned Incarnate Lord.
Lord God ! Eternal Father!
Send down the Holy Dove,
For His dear sake Who loved us,
To quicken us in love.
Bless us with His compassion,
That we, or ere we rest,
May work to bless our brethren,
And, blessing, be more blest.
