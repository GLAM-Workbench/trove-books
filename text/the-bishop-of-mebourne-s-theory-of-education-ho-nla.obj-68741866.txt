�l<e Hisiipj) of Sthmy of
Education.
Sir,
In the current general Election it is right that
the question of Education should occupy a para-
mount position, and that whatever misconceptions
surround- it should be investigated and discussed
with all possible discrimination and care. I wish
through your intervention to point out a most
important and extraordinary fallacy which seems
to be almost universally prevalent; for it pervades
every line of the letter lately addressed to the
Argus by the Bishop of Melbourne, and is entirely
overlooked by all his critics both favorable and ad-
verse. It is broadly stated in the beginning of his
letter as the basis of his theory.
His lordship corrects the Honorable the Chief
Secretary thus :? u What I said was, 1 education
u ? without religion I will not say is altogether in-
? ? jurious, but it may be said to be dangerous. It
u ?is our duty to combine religious education with
? ? secular instruction. ? And again, ? All would
? 1 agree that mere instruction without moral
u { training is, to say the least of it, a very imper-
? � feet education ; and every Christian man would
? 1 feel that moral training must be based upon


? ?religious education. An individual may be a
? 1 moral man without religion, but no community
114 can be a moral community without religion.? ?
Now I think, and confidently assert, that educa-
tion is most valuable in so far as it is moral; that
is, calculated to improve in the highest degree the
manners of men as social beings. For morals
means manners. But religion and religious instruc-
tion are a totally different thing. The latter are to
improve and perfect man?s relations with his God ;
the former, his relations with society. As the ends
are widely different, so are the means distinct; and
the more the question is examined, the more does
the distinction appear obvious and radical. If we
take the Scriptures as authoritative, we shall dis-
cover that no religious progress can be made without
special divine influence; man is wholly powerless
himself to secure that influence of the spirit which
? bloweth where it listeth.? 1 believe it to be a
growing opinion, that legislative?if not all human
interference with religious development, is but a
presumptuous and futile?nay, profane ?attempt to
usurp the divine function; and I think that this
opinion, has so far a foundation in fact, as it
expresses the complete inadequacy of human powers
and institutions to achieve spiritual progress. But
it is on all hands conceded that moral training for
social conduct is a legitimate field for legislative
action, though opinions are divided as to the
manner in which it should be applied. And the
reason of this uncertainty is just what I wish to
show.
Notwithstanding the general agreement as to the
fitness of legislation to promote social morality, we


have been so accustomed to hear our spiritual
teachers claim, unopposed, both fields of operation
as their own peculiar province, that it is now diffi-
cult to realise the fact of their real and marked
separation. I may, however, succeed in placing
the matter in such a new light that the distinction
should become plain to everyone who reads these
words. Let us imagine, for the nonce, all human
institutions for the maintenance of morality at once
and completely abolished?our laws, courts, magis-
trates, police, gaols, and penal establishments sud-
denly annihilated. ?What would result ? Would
all the elaborate machinery and strenuous efforts of
our religious establishments prove of the slightest
efficacy in restraining the immorally disposed from
indulging their propensities at the expense of their
neighbours ? Would our property or our lives be
safe for a single day ? Ko?not for an hour. But
now let us put the converse proposition. Suppose
on the contrary, our human moral government in-
tact, but our religious institutions suddenly and
entirely obliterated ; ?that every priest, bible,
church and religious idea were to vanish from the
earth. Will anyone contend for a moment that
our social moral machinery for the repression of
crime would be in the least degree less efficacious
than before in protecting our lives and property ?
I am satisfied that very few would contest the point
for a moment. In fact, the existence and main-
tenance of social checks upon immorality, prove the
general practical disbelief in the efficacy of any
others ?even though divine. I think these conside-
rations ample to prove the wide distinction between
morals and religion,?a distinction too often entirely


ignored. They prove that morality is based?not
upon religion?but upon man?s social nature and
necessities; and the vagueness and want of
precision of current moral teaching, naturally
arise from the fact that objects and means so
totally dissimilar, are thus improperly confused and
confounded together. In fact, it would not be
difficult to show that this same confusion of ideas
has too frequently produced direct antagonism?if
indeed that be not the normal and necessary
condition. Had sound moral knowledge had the
place of religious enthusiasm in the cases of the
judges of Socrates and Jesus, the world would at
least have been saved from the commission of
atrocious crime, if it might not eventually have
benefitted more : and in that of Calvin, ?his
fame would not have been tarnished by the mur-
der, in a paroxysm of piety, of the innocent
Servetus. But that very religious fervour which
formerly prompted our ancestors to incremate each
other for being conscientious?to subordinate real
and natural, to imaginary supernatural duty?is
precisely that which now interposes the principal
obstacle to the establishment here of an effective
moral (or secular) system of education.
I beg leave, however, solemnly to warn my fellow-
colonists that our population is formed of such hete-
rogeneous materials, and the rising generation has
so largely wanted good moral examples and associa-
tions, that the danger hereafter to social order is
imminent; and it is, I believe, of far greater impor-
tance than is generally imagined, to establish here
without delay, an extensive system of compulsory
education of a superior description at any cost


whatever. My own opinion is that our educational
system should be sedulously extended and remo-
delled, until we are thus enabled to lessen our
expenditure on police and gaols. For prevention is
better than cure.
The confusion of ideas as to the different means
and objects of morality and of religion is curiously
exemplified in the passage which I quoted from the
letter of his lordship. First he asserts that educa-
tion without religion may be called dangerous,
(though he omits to explain how,) and that it is
our duty to combine religious education with secular
instruction. Next, ho says (what I endorse) that
mere instruction without moral training is an
imperfect education. Then he says plainly, (as if
the sequence of the sentences proved a logical
sequence !) that moral training must be based upon
religious education, which I think I have sufficiently
disproved. But lastly, he expresses a genuine
paradox, in which the fallacy of his argument is
concentrated. He says (truly enough) an individual
may be a moral man without religion ; but, he adds,
a community cannot be a moral community without
religion. I ask?if any man in a community can
be moral without religion (as he admits), why may
not every man in the community be moral also ?
and if all the men in a community are moral (as the
Bishop cannot with his premisses consistently deny),
how can such a community be other than moral ?
The long standing and persistence of that confusion
of ideas which I have endeavored to expose, could
alone have induced a man like his lordship to write
such nonsense.
I have alluded to the nature as well as the scope


of the education which I think it is urgently
necessary to establish, meaning that it should
comprehend the ? moral training?? which his lord-
ship admits to he necessary to perfect education ;
and this demands some exposition. The suppression
of the broad distinction between moral and religious
needs and objects is so general, that I grieve to
say that I know of no school in Melbourne much
superior to the streets for acquiring moral training.
People are left to acquire it as best they can, and
too many learn it for the first time in the Police
Court when fined 40s. and taken away. But all too
late. No other of our public institutions, so far as
I am aware, is calculated to impart the important
moral knowledge why we should not lie, steal,
cheat, or murder. Prom the common school to the
University, the knowledge that is imparted may
confer power for good ?or for evil ; but the most
important knowledge? how to use it , is only taught
too late at the Police Court and the gaol. Ido not
forget that this is assumed to be partly taught to
children as religious instruction ; but the lesson for
that very reason fails to produce conviction or
practical result; the true reasons why immoral
acts should be avoided, being unconsciously sup-
pressed or subordinated to fictitious ones. The
causes and effects of human actions constitute the
materials of the most important moral knowledge
that can be learned; yet it is not attempted to be
taught, unless, as I have said, so confused and
falsified, that it cannot possibly be understood. I
know also that this knowledge is so imperfectly
apprehended, that the teachers would have to learn
it first, for that which they possess is of a totally


different. description. So much greater is the
necessity for an immediate reform. Without this
knowledge?what are the chances that the orator
will not prove a liar, the locksmith a burglar, the
penman a forger, and the chemist a poisoner ?
I bid my fellow-colonists to look to it. I believe
that I have herpin indicated the main fallacies in
connection with the subject of public education,
which confuse and mislead the popular judgment
and paralyze rational legislation ; and having done
what I conceive to be my social duty in this
respect, I have the honor to remain, Sir, yours
respectfully,
HOKOE.
