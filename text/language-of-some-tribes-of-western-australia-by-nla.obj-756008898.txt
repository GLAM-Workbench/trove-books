LANGUAGES OF SOME TRIBES OF WESTERN
AUSTRALIA.
By R. H. MATHEWS, L.S.
{Read December 6, 1907.)
For the last eight years I have been endeavoring to obtain original
information respecting the sociology, language, folklore and customs
generally of the aborigines of Western Australia. Early in 1900
I had the matter sufficiently developed to publish the sociology of
the tribes on the sources of the Ord, Fitzroy and Margaret rivers in
the Kimberley district. 1 Towards the end of the same year I pub-
lished a map showing the distribution of various tribes possessing
different types of sociology throughout nearly the whole of Western
Australia. 2
In 1901 I gave further details of the sociology as well as a vocabu-
lary of one hundred and eighteen words of the language spoken in
the Kimberley district. 3 In 1903 I described some interesting rock
paintings and carvings, and supplied vocabularies of the languages
of the natives at Roebourne and on the Lower Fitzroy river. 4 Dur-
ing 1907 I further illustrated the sociology of the tribes between
Albany and Perth, and also that of the Erlistoun tribe. 5 Some of
the folklore and customs of the aborigines of Western Australia are
now in course of publication by me elsewhere.
In the present monograph I shall briefly deal with the language
of some tribes occupying the country approximately from Laverton
and Weld Spring' eastward to the boundary of South Australia, and
extending into the territory of that state for about two hundred
miles. The total length of this tract of country may be stated as
approximately six hundred and fifty miles and its breadth three
hundred miles. Each tribe is treated under a separate heading.

The Loritya Tribe.
This tribe is located on both sides of the boundary between West -
ern Australia and South Australia. Its territory is approximately
from Blyth range northerly to Lake Macdonald, including the Tom-
kinson and Petermann ranges, and reaching into Western Australia
a considerable distance. It also extends into South Australia to the
Musgrave ranges, Lake Amadeus, and the Ehrenberg ranges.
The grammatical structure of the Loritya language is substan-
tially the same as that of the Perth natives on the Swan river. The
nouns, pronouns, verbs and other parts of speech are declined in
an analogous manner, and some words of their vocabularies are
almost identical. The Loritya grammar is also the same in principle
as that of the Arranda language, reported by me in the Proceedings
(see page 322).
Nouns.
Nouns have number, gender and case.
Number. —There are the singular, dual and plural numbers, which
are declined by postfixes; thus, kalaia, an emu; kalaiatara, a pair of
emus; kalaiakura, several or many emus.
Gender.— Sex in the human family is distinguished by different
words, as: patu, a man; kunka, a woman. For the lower animals,
gender is indicated by the addition of the word manti for males and
yakura for females. The ordinary native terms for “ father ” and
“ mother ” are often employed for the same purpose.
Case. —Examples of the nominative, causative, genitive, and in-
strumental will be given, but there are likewise forms for the dative
and ablative. The accusative is generally the same as the nomi-
native.
The nominative indicates anything at rest and is without flexion,
as: patu, a man; kunka, a woman; wonna, a yamstick.
Causative: This is used for any action described in a transitive
verb, and takes the suffix nku, as: paturku waru pungu, a man a
rock-wallaby killed.
The instrumental case takes the same suffix as the causative, as:
kunkanku inalingi wonnanku pungu, a woman a porcupine with a
vamstick killed


Genitive: This case is formed by adding ku to the nominative, as:
mqru partuku, the womera of the man, or a man’s womera; wonna
kunkaku, a woman’s yamstick.
Adjectives.
Adjectives follow the nouns which they qualify and are subject to
the same inflexions. Comparison is effected by means of two posi-
tive statements, such as: this is good—that is bad. In the declen-
sions of all the cases of nouns, and of their qualifying adjectives,
there are modifications in the affixes, depending upon the termina-
tion of the word declined. Sometimes the affix of the noun is
omitted, sometimes that of the adjective, this matter being regulated
by the euphony of the sentence.
Pronouns.
Pronouns are inflected for number, person and case, and contain
two forms of the first person in the dual and plural, marked “ inclu-
sive ” and “ exclusive ” respectively in the following tables. The
nominative pronouns are given in full.
f ist Person I Ngaiulu
Singular -j 2d Person Thou Nuntu
1 3d Person He Paluru

f Tst Person / We > inclusive Nuntungah
n . J Ist rerson l We, exclusive Ngali

3d Person They Palumkutara
f rsf Person /We, inclusive Nguntunganana
p. , J -verson } W e> exclusive Nganana
1 2d person You Ngurangari
C3d Person They Tana
The possessive pronouns are as under:
{ist Person ,Mine Ngaiuku
2d Person Thine Nuntuba
3d Person His Palumba
Palumba
{ T ,-p f Ours, inclusive Nuntungalimba
ist rerson j Ours, exclusive Ngalimba

f , -p f Ours, inclusive Nuntunganamba
p. . J Ist erson \ Ours, exclusive Nganamba
Plural j 2( j p erson Yours Ngurangarimba
e3d Person Theirs Tanamba
I am not yet in receipt of sufficiently definite information to fur-
nish details of the remaining- parts of the Loritya grammar, but the
subject will receive further attention in the near future.


The Erlistoun Tribe.
I have not been able to obtain the name of the tribe occupying the
country between Menzies and Lake Wells, including Erlistoun,
Laverton, Duketon and other places in the Mount Margaret gold
field. This tract may be approximately defined as being situated
between the 27th and 29th parallels of latitude, intercepted between
the 121st and 125th meridians of longitude. I have provisionally
adopted the name of the Erlistoun tribe for the aborigines of this
region for purposes of reference. The center of the tract of country
indicated is approximately four hundred and fifty miles west of the
western boundary of South Australia, and about the same distance
northeast of Perth, the capital of Western Australia; in other words,
about half way between Perth and the Petermann range on the
boundary between the two states mentioned.
Any information, therefore, which we can collect and promulgate
respecting the language of a tribe so situated must be of the highest
value to the ethnologist, being a connecting link between the speech
of the natives of Perth and those occupying the region on both sides
of the boundary between Western Australia and the neighboring
state of South Australia.
I have not yet succeeded in completing a grammar of the language
spoken by the natives of the Erlistoun district, but I have been for-
tunate enough to find a competent and reliable resident of that part
of the country, who has supplied me with a vocabulary of one hun-
dred and three words taken down by himself^ from the lips of old
blacks of both sexes, who were well known to him, and upon whom
he could depend.
If we compare the vocabularies of the Erlistoun and the Loritya,
printed side by side at the end of this monograph, we discover that
thirty of the words are the same or practically the same, whilst eight
others are very similar. That is to say, more than a third of the
Erlistoun words are substantially the same as the corresponding
words in the Loritya. I may state that my correspondent was alto-
gether unacquainted with the Loritya dialect, and none of the natives
of that tribe were within hundreds of miles of his home at Duketon.
There was therefore no possibility of his inadvertently mixing the
words of both tribes.


Then, if we compare the Erlistoun vocabulary with the one pub-
lished by Sir George Grey in 1839 °f the Perth language, we find
that eleven of the words are the same and that six are closely similar.
In 1903 I published a vocabulary of the dialect spoken at Roebourne,
taken down by myself from a black fellow belonging to that portion
of Western Australia. In comparing that vocabulary with the
Erlistoun, six hundred miles distant, we notice that seven of the
words are the same and two similar. These agreements in several
words of the vocabularies of tribes separated from each other by
many hundreds of miles point to a common origin of the speech of
the people over a very large geographic area.
Vocabulary.
The following vocabulary contains 127 words of the Loritya lan-
guage and 103 of the Erlistoun. The words of a similar character
are grouped together under separate headings instead of being
arranged in alphabetical sequence.
It may be explained here that I sent the same category of English
words to both my Loritya and Erlistoun correspondents, which en-
ables us to make a ready comparison. In the case of my Roebourne
vocabulary of 1903, referred to in an earlier page, I had a more or
less different list of English words for whicfy to obtain equivalents.
This remark applies also to Sir George Grey’s vocabulary. It is
probable that if we were to go to Roebourne or Perth with the list
of words contained in the attached vocabulary and interview the
natives, the identity or resemblance of many more words could be
established than we can see in the present list.
For the Loritya grammar and vocabulary I am indebted to Mr.
C/F. T. Strehlow, who has known the tribe for several years. The
vocabulary and other particulars of the Erlistoun natives were sup-
plied by Mr. Kenneth Young. Both these men have been in corre-
spondence with me for some time and I can rely upon their infor-
mation, which was obtained direct'from the aborigines.

Correction.
In volume XXXVIII of this journal, page 77, table 11, then pub-
lishing the eight intermarrying sections of the Warramonga tribe at
Tennant’s Creek, Northern Territory, I regret that some errors
crept in during my rearrangement of the section names from one
of my previous tables. Since then I have published several correct
tables, but it is only necessary to refer the reader to one of them,
given in The American Antiquarian, Vol. XXVIII, pp. 87 seq., table
IV, which supplies full details of the intermarrying laws in force
among the Warramonga natives.
