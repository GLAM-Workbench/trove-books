The Federal Interstate Commission.
R. LOCH HEAD,
Deputy Chief Traffic Manager Victorian Railways.
The approaching consummation of Federation is being watched and
waited for by the great majority of the population of the various colonies
with the keenest interest. This remark applies to the subject generally.
To many who think more deeply there are large matters of great im-
portance in the Constitution Act?such as the Constitution of the Federal
Parliament, the Executive, the Judicature, and others, ?while there are
other matters which may appear to be of interest to a section of the
community only. One of these apparently minor matters is the Inter-
State Commission which the Federal Parliament is empowered to appoint,
and which it will, no doubt, bring into being on an early date. Although
the interest in this commission and its appointment may be limited to a
section of the people, being apparently overshadowed by matters of greater
moment, yet I am convinced of its wide and deep importance, and its
beneficial and far-reaching effects under wise and able administration. At
first sight its power seems limited to the administration of the laws made
for the regulation cf the transport of passengers and goods by land and
water, and therefore of interest only to those engaged in the conduct of this
business. Further consideration, however, discloses the controlling effect
the charges for this transport, together with their fair, equitable, and undis-
criminating incidence, has on the untrammelled movement and distribution
of trade and commerce. It will therefore be evident that a commission
administering the laws regulating such matters is entrusted with great
powers of influence and control. The interest felt in the commission should
not, therefore, be limited to any one class j but as the exercise of its
power will, in some degree, influence each individual of the Commonwealth,
interest in it should be taken wherever Federation will establish control
However, as a railway man, I desire, first of all, to interest railway men
in the subject, hoping its discussion will eventually 7 interest the whole
community. It is proposed, as a preliminary, to quote in full the clauses
of the Commonwealth Act dealing with the Inter-State Commission.
The first is Clause ioi, which provides that
There shall be an Inter-State Commission, with such powers of adjudication
and administration as the Parliament deems necessary for the execution and
maintenance, within the Commonwealth, of the provisions of this Constitu-
tion relating to trade and commerce, and of all laws made thereunder.


The duty devolving upon the commission is to administer the laws which
the Federal Parliament is authorised td make. : '
Clause 51 states ?
The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make
laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth, with
respect to: ?
1. Trade and commerce with other countries, and among the States.
The power of the Parliament in respect of these matters is further defined
in Clause 98 ?
The power of the Parliament to make laws with respect to trade and com-
merce extends to navigation and shipping, and to railways the property of any
State.
The power of the Parliament in respect of the scope of these laws is
somewhat restricted by certain considerations. Such as are set out in
Clause 99 ?
The Commonwealth shall not, by any law or regulation of trade, com-
merce, or revenue, give preference to one State or any part thereof,
and Clause 100 ?
The Commonwealth shall not, by any law or regulation of trade or com-
merce, abridge the right of a State or of the residents therein to the reason-
able use of the waters of rivers for conservation or irrigation.
Further, the Parliament may control the action of the management of the
railways of any State in respect of certain matters, which are disclosed in
Clause 102?
The Parliament may by any law with respect to trade or commerce forbid,
as to railways, any preference or discrimination by any State, or by any
authority constructed under a State, if such preference or discrimination is
undue and unreasonable, or unjust to any State, due regard being had to the
financial responsibilities incurred by any State in connection with the con-
struction and maintenance of its railways. But no preference or discrimination
shall, within the meaning of this section, be taken to be undue and unreason-
able, or unjust, to any State, unless so adjudged by the Inter-State Com-
mission.
and Clause 104 ?
Nothing in this Constitution shall render unlawful any rate for the car-
riage of goods upon a railway, the property of a State, if the rate is deemed by
the Inter-State Commission to be necessary for the development of the ter-
ritory of the State, and if the rate applies equally to goods within the State
and to goods passing into the State from other States.
The adjudication of these clauses is placed in the hands of these Inter-
State Commissioners, and in dealing with them the commission practically
sits as a jury, sifting out the facts of all cases either instituted by itself or
brought before it by any aggrieved State or individual. Subject, of course,
to the Parliament in all matters, the commission is also subject to the High
Court of Australia. In the latter case, however, the subjection is limited
to questions of law, not of facts, as provided in Clause 78 ?
The High Court shall have jurisdiction, with such exceptions and subject to
such regulations as the Parliament prescribes, to hear and determine appeals
from all judgments, decrees, orders, and sentences.
Sub-clause 3
Of the Inter-State Commission, hut as to questions of law only.


It will be observed that matters of fact do not come within the province
of the High Court of Australia. The Inter-State Commissioners are the
sole arbiters of these.
Further, the method of the appointment of the commission, its duration,
and remuneration is provided for in Clause 103 ?
The members of the Inter-State Commission?
1. Shall be appointed by the Governor-general in Council.
n. Shall hold office for seven years, but may be removed within that time
by the Governor-general in Council, on an address from both Houses
of the Parliament in the same session praying for such removal on
the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity.
in. Shall receive such remuneration as the Parliament may fix; but such
remuneration shall not bo diminished during their continuance in
office.
After an examination of these clauses, it will be obvious it is no exaggera-
tion to state that the powers of this commission are great and far-reaching,
and consequently its influence on the welfare of a State or individual is
extensive. At the same time, these powers are limited to those of adjudica-
tion and administration of the provisions of the Constitution relating to
trade and commerce and of all laws made thereunder.
In the debates in the Convention on the subject, opinion appeared to be
divided as to the benefits of. or necessity for the commission, and almost
as a consequence its powers and duties were left somewhat indefinite. No
doubt these will be clearly laid down before its appointment.
In this article no attempt will be made to- compare the circumstances
under which similar commissions to that now proposed here were appointed
in Great Britain and the United States of America, nor of the Acts w r hich
these bodies administer, further than to state that all have, in common, as
the main reason of their existence, the common law basis that in all cases
under similar circumstances charges for transport shall be reasonable and
just, and that unjust discriminations shall be prevented.
It will be now attempted to define what is considered to be the powers
and limits of the Australian Commission. As the name indicates, it has
no power or control over the internal, as distinguished from the Inter-State,
business of any State, except, of course, so far as a State should by any
action, direct or indirect, interfere with the free flow of trade and commerce
in any other State. According to the wording of the Constitution Act, the
powers of the commission are limited to adjudication and administration,
and in so doing its members will find ample work. At the same time,
to be entirely effective, it must-be always alert and ready to- detect any
infringement of the laws. These infringements, from the very nature of
the circumstances under which they can take place, may be insidious and
therefore difficult of detection. I am further of opinion that to successfully
carry out its duties a certain amount of executive power must also be re-
posed on it. But this is the utmost limit. It may seek a certain share of
legislative power, but this should, under no circumstances, be conceded.


At this point, and to show clearly what is meant by the latter remark* It
is considered that the making of a fare or rate for the carriage of pas?*
sengers or goods is practically a legislative act, and consequently a power
which this commission should not possess. As no commission or other
body brought into existence by a Parliament should possess, or even share
in the smallest degree equal power with it, so this commission should not
be entrusted with even the shadow of legislative power. If this were pos-
sible, then it might also usurp the functions of the High Court of Australia,
which it is really designed to assist, and to which it is alsd in the nature of
an advison- board.
Endeavour will now be made to briefly state the radical differences be-
tween the proposed commission here and similar commissions in Great
Britain and the United States. The main difference is that the railways in
those countries are owned by private companies, whilst here they are State-
owned. The commission here has to conserve the rights of States, while
in Great Britain and the United States the conservation of the rights of
individuals is the chief consideration. The principle in both cases,
however, is the same. As has been previously pointed out, what each
has in common is to see that just and reasonable rates, in all cases under
similar circumstances, are charged to all, and that unjust discriminations
are prevented. In Great Britain certain control of the means of transport
is given under somewhat similar circumstances to two bodies ?the Board
of Trade (railway department) and the Railway Commissioners. The latter
body is on similar lines to the Inter-State Commerce Commission of the
United States. The former is almost solely an investigating body.
It will, therefore, it is now thought, be obvious that, as the railways
are the principal means of transport here between the States, the main
duties of the commission will be in connection with them, and hence the
interest the whole community should have in its administration.
In passing, it may be remarked that although it has not yet been decided
to federalise the railways, that important step will, no doubt, be taken in
the near future, and then it is proliable the position of this commission will
be considerably affected.
Railway and Canal Commission of Great Britain.
The foregoing is a slight general sketch of the subject of the Inter-State
Commission as provided for in the Commonwealth Act, and before entering
upon details, it is proposed, first of all, to present a short sketch of similar
or analogous commissions elsewhere, and so enable readers to make com-
parison with the powers and duties possessed by such commissions and those
with which the proposed commission here are to lie entrusted. There are
at present such commissions in existence in Great Britain and the United
States of America.


It may here l)e premised that the reason for the being or existence of
such bodies is founded on the theory that railways or other means of com-
munication are public highways, that traders and carriers are consequently
dependent upon them, and that their charges necessarily affect every section
of the community; further, that the necessity for the existence of such com-
missions is consequent upon complaints having arisen as to alleged exces-
sive and illegal charges, the difficulty of obtaining information as to rates
authorised and variations in rates without any corresponding variation in
the cost of service to the railway or other company, and often in favour
of particular towns or of export or import traffic.
With these remarks it is now proposed to give a short statement of the
present Railway and Canal Commission of Great Britain.
The Railway and Canal Traffic Act of 1888 established the present per-
manent tribunal for the determination of differences between the railway
and canal companies and the public on the Ist January, 1889. Prior, how-
ever, to this (in 1873) a previous commission had been appointed, as a
result of one of the recommendations of a joint committee of both Houses
of Parliament, which met in 1872. This committee had been appo-inted
owing to a demand, principally from traders, that matters of dispute be-
tween them and the railways, involving questions of preferential treatment
and obstruction to traffic, could be better'dealt with by a special tribunal
having practical and expert knowledge of such subjects, it being recognised,
both by traders and the courts (one of the latter having previously dealt
with such matters), that a purely legal tribunal was not the best to settle
such differences. This commission of 1873 was entrusted with the jurisdic-
tion of the Court of Common Pleas, which had up till that date adjudicated
on disputes between the traders and the railways, but unsatisfactorily by
reason of the lack on the part of its judges of special and expert knowledge.
It will therefore be seen that the British Parliament recognised that such
disputes were largely outside the intelligent determination of the judges of
the Court of Common Pleas, possessing purely legal knowledge, and must
be dealt with by men having special and technical knowledge obtained by a
long training "in such subjects. For these reasons the commission
of 1873, possessing expert knowledge, was substituted for
the Court of Common Pleas to deal with all such cases. As justi-
fying this course, it may be mentioned that when, by the Railway and C anal
Traffic Act of 1854, these duties were imposed on the Court of Common
Pleas, Lord Caims, then one of the judges, protetsted, together with his
brother judges, against this, urging that their want of special knowledge
and training precluded them from dealing satisfactorily with such cases,
at the same time stating that to become possessed of the expert knowledge
of even one branch of the subject he would require to become an appren-
tice to a civil engineer, and consequently the same to every other branch.
To justify the foregoing remarks, a statement of some of the powers within
the jurisdiction of the commission will now be given, which will show not
only its extensive character but also the wide variety of the subjects to be
adjudicated on. The following are included:


To enforce obligations?
(1) Relating to traffic facilities and undue preference.
(2) Requiring companies to provide works for public accommodation.
Imposing obligations on companies?
(3) In favour of the public or any individual.
(4) Deciding questions involving the legality of charges sought to be
made by companies.
(5) To order traffic facilities and through rates.
(6) As to publication and disintegration of rates.
(7) As to terminal charges.
(8) Approval of working agreements between companies.
(9) Sanction of agreements between railway and canal companies.
(10) Differences between Postmaster-general and companies as to con-
veyance of mails.
And many other duties.
It will be observed that the wideness of the subjects embraces nearly
every detail of railway management.
The commission?s authority also extends to harbours, ports, and docks,
as appeals to it may be made by any harbour or port authority or dock
companies against preferences granted by railways affecting their property.
However, to put it shortly, the main objects of the British commission
are to compel companies?
(1) To afford reasonable facilities for traffic.
(2) To abstain from undue preference of particular persons, or descrip-
tion of traffic. '
(3) To afford facilities for through traffic in the case of continuous
lines.
It will at once be observed the wideness of the jurisdiction and the
magnitude of the powers entrusted to the commission in respect of the
supervision of railways and canals, all of which are necessary' to ensure
to the public the full benefit of those systems.
The Railway and Canal Traffic Act of 1873 a^so made provision for other
duties attaching to the commission.
The commission was clothed with most of the powers of the legal tribunals
(the power of punishing for contempt of court excepted), and were em-
powered to make general orders for regulating proceedings before them;
further, that their decisions in questions of fact were final. In the event,
however, in their opinion, of a question of law being raised, they were, as
the case might require, either directed or empowered to state a case for
the opinion of a legal court. It was in this respect only that any pro-
vision was made for an appeal from their decision.
It will now be of interest to consider the personnel of this commission.
It consisted of three members, one of whom was to be of experience in the
law and one of experience in railway business; the nature of the experience
of the third member was not stated.


Subsequently, as previously stated, further legislation took place in 1888,
and the Railway and Canal Traffic Act of that year was passed, which pro-
vided for another commission, conferring not only all the powers of the
previous commission but considerably enlarging them. It was endowed
with all the powers, rights, and privileges of a supreme court as to enforce-
ment of its orders, the attendance and examination of witnesses, the pro-
duction and inspection of documents, and entry on and inspection of pro-
perty; it was also to be a Court of Record,* including the power to fine
and punish, and could grant injunctions against continued violation of the
law.
The personnel of this commission consists of five members, and of this
number three are ex-officio members. The ex-officio members are judges
of England, Scotland, and Ireland, one being nominated for each country,
and are not required to act outside the country for which they are nominated.
The remaining two members are selected by the president of the Board of
Trade (one of whom must be of experience in railway matters), and hold
office during good behaviour, and are not permitted to accept any employ-
ment inconsistent with devoting their whole time to official duties. The
commissioners may hold sittings in public or private in any part of the United
Kingdom. In all cases the ex-officio member presides. In matters of law
the opinion of the presiding judge is to prevail; only in matters of fact
the decision is bv the majority. In the latter case there is no appeal. Ihe
only appeal lies against a decision in the matter of law, which, as previously
stated, has been given by the presiding judge. Notwithstanding these large
powers, the commission has only proved a qualified success, the real power
appearing to lie in the knowledge of the deterring and controlling influence
it possesses.
In concluding this portion of the subject, it is to be pointed out that the
large power possessed by the commission is evidence of the importance
attached by the Parliament of Great Britain to the prevention of any inter-
ference with the freedom of trade and commerce.
Interstate Commerce Commission, U.S.A
The passing of the Inter-State Commerce Commission Act of the United
States of America ?known as ? The Act to Regulate Commerce ?on the
4th February, 1887, was the result of long and protracted inquiry into the
complaints that had arisen against the methods and practices, adopted by
the owners of the railways, in connection with their use by the public. The
establishment and extension of a new mode of land transport by means of
railways had practically created a new power in the country, and its un-
regulated exercise had disclosed serious defects. It had also become ap-
parent that results disastrous to the best interests of the community would
accompany the arbitrary use of this power.
* A Court of Record is one whereof the acts and judicial proceedings are
enrolled for a perpetual memory and testimony, which rolls are called the
records of the court, and are of such supereminent authority that their truth
is not to be called in question.


It will be well at this point to look for a moment at the relation of railway
communication to the public interest. As pointed out in a previous article,
the railways of a country, whether owned by the State or by private persons,
are really its highways, largely taking the place of the ordinary highways,
and, theoretically, both should be equally free. In other words, this is
saying that the railways, if not owned by the State, should certainly be con-
trolled and regulated by it. The reason would appear to be obvious that
the freedom possessed by the people of a country to ride or walk, or to
drive their own vehicles over the ordinary highways should lie, under cer-
tain limitations, the privilege of every individual on any road. It is of
course apparent that so long as the use of highways is the privilege of all,
the cost of their construction and maintenance is properly chargeable to
taxpayers generally. But w r hen special provision and increased facilities of
transport are provided by means of railways, the extra cost of the services
is properly limited to the users thereof.
In the case of State-owned railways, the position would appear to be
that any general benefit they confer on the community at large should be
valued, and the amount in some form of tax collected from it, the balance
of cost of service, and interest on cost of construction, to be paid by the
users of the railways. I am of course aware that other considerations enter
into the question, but I am here only referring to the broad general prin-
ciples that govern the railway problem.
In the case of the private-owned railways, other considerations necessarily
arise, the main consideration being that, in addition to the charges previously
referred to, the stock-holders require a profit on their capital invested. This
is the radical difference to be taken into consideration when any attempt is
made to compare the results of the management of the State-owned railways
of Australia with the privately-owned railways of Great Britain and the
United States.
To return, however, to the immediate subject in hand. The position, so
far as the law' w'as concerned, appeared to be this; That so long as the
common highways of the country were sufficient for the free movement
of persons and interchange of traffic, the common law was apparently suffi-
cient to meet any difficulties that might arise in connection with their use,
and the necessary regulations made w r ere easily administered.
But the new means of land transportation, wffiich created traffic by the
very facilities it afforded, changed all this. In the first place, the common
highways became inadequate for the purposes of interchange, not only in
the matter of the volume of business, but in that of time. Time became
the essence of the contract. So far as the transit of passengers was con-
cerned, increasing business and the pursuit of pleasure rendered the annihila-
tion of time and space, so far as this w r as practicable, to be imperative.
The purpose here is to make clear how' the prosperous social, commercial,
and industrial life of the community is intimately connected with, and affected
by, the means and cost of transport of persons and goods. This being so,
the regulation of the traffic became a matter of serious moment to those
immediately affected. In the first instance the regulations made for the


management and control of the railways were necessarily the creation of
their owners, and would of course be framed in their own interest. While
still subject to the common law and its regulations, it can easily be under-
stood that the new conditions of transport would disclose matters incidental
thereto requiring regulation which could not possibly have been anticipated
by the framers of those in existence, and, consequently, the owners of the
railways had the framing of the new regulations in their own hands. Not
only so, but they were also in a position to determine what their relations
in all matters of transport should be to those dealing with them, while the
latter had apparently no alternative but to agree to the terms dictated. To
contest those terms would probably prove expensive and tedious, with the
issue doubtful. Such a condition of affairs could only last so long as
justice and fairness were dealt out to everyone, but it would be against all
experience to expect that abuse of the power would not arise, and this
was what actually happened. Abuses of a very' flagrant kind crept in.
The situation may be stated in this way: When the advantages of a
railroad to a district became obvious, the demand for their wide extension
in every direction became general, and the consequence was that railways
were built into districts which could not support them, or competing rail-
ways were built in districts which could only support one.
The consequence was that competition for business became so excessive,
that to secure it all sorts of tricks and artifices were resorted to. When it is
pointed out that the making ot the rates chargeable were entirely in the
hands of the manager of the railways, and how thereby they could favour
persons, localities or commodities, it will be at once clear how they practi-
cally had the prosperity or otherwise of persons and places in their hands.
It is needless here to enter into the details of the abuses that arose, but
the result was the demand for better regulation and stricter control by the
Government of the country 7 .
As stated at the commencement of this article, long, exhaustive, and
protracted inquiry led to the passing of the Inter-State Commerce Commis-
sion Act, which came into force on 4th February, 1887, and as amended
on 2nd March, 1889, and 10th February, 1891, still continues to be the
law of the land.
The Commission was appointed on 31st March, 1887, and at once com-
menced its duties. The personnel of the Commission consists of five
members chosen as far as is practicable, so that each section of the country
shall be personally represented. In its operations it is assisted by a secre-
tary. statistician, and complete staff of officers. Its inquiries and delibera-
tions are held in various parts of the States, the locality being determined
by the situation of the interests affected. The main objects of the Act
are to secure fairness and equality to all persons. All carriers are made
subject to its provisions. The following are some of its leading features .
1. That all charges for services must be reasonable and just, unjust
and unreasonable charges are prohibited and declared unlawful.
2. The direct or indirect charging, demanding, collecting, or receiving
for any service rendered, greater or less compensation from any one or more


persons than from others for alike and contemporaneous sendees, declared
to be unjust discrimination, and is prohibited.
3- The giving of any undue or unreasonable preferences, as between
persons, localities, or kinds of traffic, or the subjecting of any one of them
to undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage, is declared to be un-
lawful.
4. Reasonable, proper, and equal facilities for the interchange of traffic
and delivering of passengers and property between connecting lines is
required, and discrimination in rates and charges between connecting lines
is forbidden.
5- ft i s niade unlawful to charge or receive any greater compensation
in the aggregate for the transportation of passengers, or the like kind of
pioperty, under substantially similar circumstances and conditions, for a
shorter than for a longer distance, over the same line in the same direction,
the shorter being included within the longer distance.
6. Contracts, agreements, or combinations for the pooling of freights of
different and competing railroads, or for dividing between them the aggre-
gate or net earnings of such railroads or any portion thereof, are declared
to be unlawful.
7. All carriers, subject to the law, are required to print their tariffs for
transportation of persons and property, and to keep them at their depots
tor public inspection.
These are the leading features of the Act, but its operation has met with
only a moderate success. This is principally due to the fact that the Com-
mission does not possess power to make its decisions of binding force or
to give them finality. The Commission is not a Court, and therefore
lias no means of enforcing its orders. It is endeavouring now to acquire
this authority, but, so far, without success. Its main aim appears to be to
secure the power of determining the rates properly chargeable, and binding
the railway companies to charge only these rates. But as indicated pre-
viously, ratemaking, which is the power sought, is one which a Legislature
will not readily part with. b
It may be here explained, in addition to the Inter-State Commission,
many <>� the States possess a local Railway Commission, with powers varying
m each State according to the decision of the Legislature. These Commis
sions deal with the internal traffic only, and one of the reasons that led to
the appointment of the Inter-State Commission was the absence of control
these State lx>dies possessed when traffic passed into an adjoining State.
Shortly each. States Commission deals with traffic wholly within its ter-
aVi' 1 ?? � hl e tl l e ] " ter ? State Commission deals with all traffic not so limited
All traffic is therefore subject to the control of either a State or Inter-State
Commission.
In addition to the duties of carrying out the provisions of the Act, the
goods 11SS1 � n haS endeavo,ured to serure uniformity of the classification of


In the United States there are three leading classifications, ?the ? official ??
the ? western ? and the ? southern.? The Commission has sought to have
these made uniform, but the attendant difficulties are great, due chiefly to
the fact, that, owing to local circumstances, there is no uniform condition of
business throughout the States. The Commission has also made a special
feature of the preparation of the Statistics, the details being supplied by
the various railway companies. It attaches great importance and value to
them, arguing that complete and comprehensive Statistics are absolutely neces-
sary to enable it to intelligently determine the questions that are brought
before it in connection with the reasonableness, fairness, and stability of
rates.
The Board of Trade, Great Britain.
It is now proposed to furnish a statement of the powers and duties pos-
sessed by the Board of trade of Great Britain in respect of the supervision
and control of the railways of that nation.
The first board of trade to supervise, and foster the trade and commerce
of the United Kingdom was constituted in the seventeenth century, its
members belonged to the Privy Council, and really formed a permanent
committee of that body. Its main duties at that time were to see to the
proper administration of the mercantile and navigation laws. It also pos-
sessed a supervising control over the then recently established colonies of
the United Kingdom. The board passed through many vicissitudes accord-
ing as the ruling power and the time deemed its assistance valuable or other-
wise. The position of secretary, on whose activity and knowledge its success-
ful administration largely depended, has at various times been held by cele-
brated persons. At one period John Locke, the philosopher, held the posi-
tion, at another Matthew Prior, the poet, while at another it was held by
Edward Gibbon, the historian. It appears incongruous to read of such men
holding the position, as apparently their tastes and occupations lay in quite
an opposite direction. When colonisation became a prominent feature of
England?s policy the board was charged with the duty of watching over
the affairs of the colonies. This brings us to the present Board of Trade,
which was constituted in 1786 by an Order-in-Council, under which it is still
regulated. It also brings us to the more immediate purpose of our article
?the supervision and control of railways by the board. When railways
began to be operated under various acts of Parliament there was no public
body or commission charged with their supervision. As the various ques-
tions and problems arose, which experience has since shown to be peculiarly
incidental to railways, some supervising body or power became absolutely
necessary. This duty devolved upon the Board of Trade. In more recent
times, and immediately following upon the extension of railways, it became
necessary to subdivide the numerous duties of the board into departments.
The subdivision is as follows: ??
(1) The commercial department. (Amongst the duties of this depart-
ment is the preparation of the statistics of railways. Ihese
statistics are of the greatest value for comparative purposes.)


(2) The railway department.
(3) The marine department.
(4) The harbour department.
(5) The finance department.
(6) The fisheries department.
As our immediate subject is railways, the duties and powers of that de-
partment will be more fully described.
This department was originally constituted in 1840. Its duties and powers
are set out in the various railway acts passed since that time, and are of the
most important and onerous character. These include the inspection of
railways before they are open for traffic, inquiries into accidents, reports
on proposed railways, approval of by-laws, appointment of arbitrators in
disputes, approving classification end rate schedules, together with many
other duties apart from railways?such as the inspection of tramways, and
matters relating to gas, water, and electric lighting schemes.
To come, now, to close detail. It is found that recent legislation in
Great Britain has imposed further duties upon the railway department of
the Board of Trade and given it greater power. As time went on experience
disclosed some necessary limitation of privilege granted or more accurate
definition of obligation imposed on railways, and these
it was the duty of the Board of Trade to sanction, enforce,
control, or approve, as the case might be. ft will thus be observed how-
wide the supervision and how large is the power possessed by the board
over railways. Its first, and one of its most important, duties is to investi-
gate on proposed new railways, for the construction of which its sanction
is necessary. Following upon its sanction of the construction of a railway
comes the necessity for its certificate before it can be opened for public
traffic. Its certificate is also necessary for any extension or alteration of a
railway. Following upon this conies its inspection of the appliances used
on the railway, to see that they are up to date and of the most perfect
character, so that, as far as human skill can compass the purpose, perfect
safety is provided for the public. Further, the Board of Trade has- super-
vision over bridges, level crossings, signal arrangements, and brake power.
In the two latter matters it requires returns of the signal arrangements and
brake power used in the railways. Although it is without power to en-
force alterations or additions of any kind, yet its recommendations and
suggestions are of such weight as to practically amount to orders. All
accidents must be reported to it, and in the case of those resulting in loss
of life strict inquiry and investigation take place. Should alterations or
additions to prevent repetition be necessary, suggestions to provide such
are made that, in most cases, are equivalent to instructions to managers of
railways, and are obeyed accordingly.
All by-laws made by the various companies have to be submitted to the
board for approval, and by this means uniformity and effectiveness?most
desirable qualities in railway matters ?are at once attained.


It is thus obvious that the board possesses the power of keeping the
railways up to a high standard. This is no doubt attained by the high
standard at which the staff of the board itself is kept. It is stated that the
board?s staff of officers is possessed of the knowledge of the whole of the
details of the construction, maintenance, and working of railways. In this
respect, no doubt, the proposed Inter-State Commission will follow the
example of the Board of Trade. In traffic matters the Board of Trade is
also furnished with powers sufficient to enable it to secure the confidence ot
the traders and the public. For example, before the rates and charges of a
railway become legal the Board must be furnished with a classification of
goods and live stock, together with a schedule of maximum rales to be
charged, distinguishing between the rates for haulage and those for other ser-
vices. This classification and schedule are then published, and invitations
issued to those interested to state objections (if any). On the approval by the
board of the classification and schedule, they are then sent as a Bill to
Parliament to be dealt with in due course.
In the event of a trader or body of traders complaining that any of
the companies refuse through rates, or charge unfair or excessive rates,
or treat them oppressively or unreasonably, it is provided that the Board
of Trade shall receive such complaints, and, if unable to obtain from the
companies any redress, then it may give its certificate for complainants to
appear before the railway commissioners. The board thus acts as a
mediator between the traders and the railways, and, no doubt, saves, or at
all events, minimises, the cost of litigation. Ihe same remarks will apply
to complaints made by traders of undue preference. In this matter recent
legislation has provided that even if a rate is proved to be one of undue
preference, yet, if it is necessary in the public interest, it must not be
altered. The decision of this intricate question rests* with the Board ol
Trade.
In Great Britain, where the railways are all in private hands, it is of
the utmost importance, to investors especially, that the accounts of the
railways should be clear and uniform, and this the Board of Trade has
been able to secure. The large power possessed by the board is apparent,
and it appears to have secured the confidence of the railways, the traders,
and the public. It would therefore appear that it has acted fairly for all
interests concerned. In conclusion it may l>e stated that the management
of the board is in the hands of a president (who has usually a seat in the
Cabinet), a parliamentary secretary, a permanent secretary, six assistant
secretaries, assisted by a large staff experienced in all the details of the
construction, maintenance, and working of a railway.
The Value of Statistics.
Attention should now be directed to the value and importance of lull and
accurate statistics of railways, to the management of railways, but especially
to the Commission to be appointed by the Federal Parliament on its
establishment.


By many minds the mention of statistics is received with a shudder, as
they are not supposed to possess any real practical value. It is considered
to be a subject for the student, or at most, for the consideration of a
limited number of persons only. The general impression is that, in the
hands of those conversant with statistics, the figures can be made to prove
anything, and, therefore, the general reader is liable to be hood-winked, or
at all events misled by them.
The position of statistics is regarded by many as being humorously, if
not altogether truthfully, put, as the superlative degree of lying, for it is
said that there are three degrees of lying ?viz., lies, d ?d lies, and statistics.
In the following remarks, however, I hope to show that statistics are of
the utmost practical value, and that the proposed Inter-State Commission
will not be able to intelligently decide many questions that will be brought
before it without their aid. When the appointment of an Inter-State Com-
mission was under the consideration of the Congress of the United States
of America, the importance of statistics was fully recognised by the
Select Committee of that body charged with the duty of preparing the
Inter-State Commerce Commission Act, and consequently Section 20 of the
Act, to regulate commerce, provides :
That the Commission is hereby authorised to require annual reports from
all common carriers subject to the provisions of this Act: to fix the time,
and prescribe the manner in which such reports shall be made:, and to
require from such carriers specific answers to all questions upon which the
Commission may need information. Such annual reports shall show in
detail the amount of capital stock issued, the amounts paid therefor, and the
manner of payment for the same, the dividends paid, the surplus funds,
if any, and the number of stock holders, the funded and floating debts,
and the interest paid thereon, the cost and value of the carrier?s property,
franchise, and equipment, the number of employes, and the salaries paid
each class, the amounts expended for improvements each year, how ex-
pended, and the character of such improvements, the earnings and receipts
from each branch of business, and from all sources, the operating and
other expenses, the balances of profit and loss, and a complete exhibit of
the financial operations of the carrier each year, including an annual
balance-sheet. Such reports shall also contain such information in relation
lb contracts with other common carriers as the Commission may require,
and the said Commission may, within its discretion, for the purpose of
enabling it the better to carry out the purposes of this Act, prescribe (if,
in the opinion of the Commission, it is practicable to prescribe, such
uniformity and methods of keeping accounts) a period of time within which
all common carriers subject to the provisions of this Act shall have, as
near as may be, a uniform system of accounts, and the manner in which
such accounts shall be kept.
In passing it will, of course, be remarked that much of this detail can
only apply to railways privately owned; but, at the same time, the most
of it is also applicable to State railways.


A careful study of the clause shows how fully the subject had been
thought out by Congress, and how thoroughly seized it was of the necessity
of obtaining full details of all railway and transport business generally.
The Inter-State Commerce Commission also, fully recognising the im-
portance of the subject, at once went to work to secure the fullest details,
and after prolonged discussion with the leading railway accountants, de-
cided upon the following subdivision of the subjects on which information
was desired:
(i) History.
(2) Organisation.
(3) Officers.
(4) Property operated.
(5) Capital stock.
(6) Funded debt.
(7) Floating debt and current liabilities.
(8) Permanent improvements for the year in construction and equipment.
(9) Cost of road and equipment, showing full details.
(10) Income account.
(11) Earnings from operations giving full rletail of passengers, freight,
and other earnings.
(12) Bonds and stock owned.
(13) Operating expenses, giving details of maintenance of way and struc-
tures, maintenance of equipment, conducting transportation, general
expenses.
(14) Rentals paid.
(15) General balance-sheet.
(16) Financial operations for the vear.
(17) Important changes during the year.
(18) Contracts, agreements, etc.
(19) Security for funded debt.
(20) Employes and salaries.
(21) Passenger, freight, and train mileage.
(22) Details of freight traffic movement.
(23) Description of equipment.
(24) Mileage of road operated, including renewals of rails and ties.
(25) Consumption of fuel by.locomotives.
(26) Accidents.
(27) Characteristics of road.
Again, it will be observed that much of the information required is by
reason of the private ownership of the roads, but the bulk of it is valuable,
in the case of either private or State-owned railways.
The importance of statistics was not recognised by the Congress of the
United States only. Their importance is equally appreciated elsewhere.
In Great Britain the, Commercial Department of the Board of Trade is


charged with the preparation of statistics of all kinds, including the move-
ments of trade, and the full details of railway working. In France and
Germany details even fuller than I have indicated are prepared.
It may, of course, be asked at this point as to the reasons for apparently
limiting the discussion to that of the statistics of railways. The answer to
that is that the primary r and nearly the whole duty of the proposed Inter-
State Commission will be to provide for the free flow of trade and com-
merce, mainly conducted by transportation; and by reason of our physical
conditions in Australia, this is almost entirely done by rail, consequently
our railways loom largely in any discussion of this kind.
It may further be asked in what manner the statistics may be practically
utilised by the Inter-State Commission.
In connection with the cost of transport, there are three persons interested,
the investor in privately-owned railways, or the whole community in the
case of State railways, the public who use the railways, and those who
manage them.
The investor, or the whole community, as the case may be, is interested
in full and authentic details of the capital cost, the method by which the
amount was raised, the amount of interest, and the method of its payment.
The public using the railways are interested in obtaining just, reasonable,
and stable rates and fares, and the management is interested in securing the
latest improvements, so that cost may be cheapened. It is only by obtaining
full details of the business that intelligent comparisons can be made, and
it is only by true deductions from these comparisons that actions may be
indicated, and consequently by means of statistics the interests of all con-
cerned can be conserved. This is dealing with the railways in existence,
but the future of that means of transportation here is very great. That
future, it is assumed, will be largely determined by the Inter-State Com-
mission by means of the information it gathers. It is here taken for granted
that it is only a question of time when the railways will be federalised,
and, consequently, the construction of railways will be the result of Federal
action. Necessarily, the full development of the country will be, by means
of its transport facilities, adjusted to the distribution of the people and
the industries or employments in which they are engaged.
The Inter-State Commission would appear to be the body to collect the
necessary information, and to be the bodv to which the Federal Parliament
would look for expert and intelligent advice on the subject. It will be
observed that the various points of the subject have been indicated, rather
than discussed in full, but enough, I think, has been said to show the
importance of statistics to the proposed Inter-State Commission.
During the last seventy years improved methods of transportation have
almost revolutionised society and trade everywhere, and their ultimate
effects, especially in new countries such as Australia, are hardly yet grasped.
It is open, therefore, to the Inter-State Commission, by a comprehensive
grasp of the whole subject, to assist at the solution of the transport
problem.


Preferential Rates.
It is now proposed to deal with the subject of preferential rates. The
special legislation passed in Great Britain and the United States of
America during the present century in connection with railways has been
mainly due to the difficulties and inequalities that have arisen in connection
with the charges made for the carriage and facilities provided for the safe,
speedy, and economical handling of passengers and goods.
The main object to be secured is fair treatment as between districts,
traders, and commodities. In common law each side or party is entitled
to absolute fairness and equality of treatment, and any deviation from this
to the advantage of one side or to the prejudice of the other furnishes
ground for complaint and remedy. The earlier legislation in Great Britain
provided for absolute equality of treatment in the matter of charges for
carriage and facilities for transit, but in practical working it was soon
discovered that the continuance of this system or its rigid application would
probably retard progress in the construction of railways or the provision of
increased and improved facilities, and so a change in legislation became
necessary. It will be well at this point to state briefly the existing legisla-
tion in connection with the subject of rates and charges for the carriage
of passengers and goods by all modes of transport, and which became
necessary unless common carriers (railway carriers especially) were allowed
to retain a power which, wielded arbitrarily, could be most disastrous for
interests they did not choose to favour. Ihe making or marring of districts
and traders would practically be in the carriers? hands if allowed to mete
out unequal treatment to those dealing with them. The legal position
of the common carrier may be here stated. By reason of his profession he
is under a common law obligation to accept and carry all goods delivered
to him for carriage on being paid a reasonable sum for so doing, but at
the same time he is under no obligation to deal with all his customers
exactly alike or equally, and, assuming that the charge made is not an
unreasonable one, he is not prevented from charging a favoured customer
a less sum or even to carry free. The effects of the abuse of the use of
such a power early became evident, and legislation placing some limitation
on it became imperative. In 1845 the Railways Clauses Consolidation Act
was passed in Great Britain, and this included what is known as ? the
equalitv clause ? ?a substitute for a clause providing for equal mileage rates
and appearing in previous general and special acts. The section of the
act referred to consists of three clauses. The first is a permission to com-
panies to vary their tolls within the limits set by their special acts; the
second is a proviso that the tolls for goods of the same description passing
only over the same portion of line under the same circumstances shall in
all cases be equal; the third is a prohibition of any reduction or advance in
favour of or against any particular company or person. The word ? toll,? as
here employed, is to be understood as including rates of all kinds, it being
obviously used in its connection with the original practice of the railways


of taking toll for the use of their roads instead of, as now, acting as carriers
themselves. This legislation only proved partially successful, as evasion by
various means became easy of accomplishment. The difficulty of proof and
the expense of litigation made the aggrieved parties, on whom lay the
onus of proof of prejudice or disadvantage, hesitate to enter into a contest
with powerful railway companies, and so> in many cases, the above-cited
clauses became practically inoperative. Additional legislation became neces-
sary, and this was provided for in the Traffic Act of 1854, the following
clause extending the application of the clause of the act of 1845 appearing
therein. The clause provides that ?No such company (railway company,
canal company, railway and canal company) shall make or give any undue
or unreasonable preference or advantage to or in favour of any particular
person, or company, or any particular description of traffic in any respect
whatsoever, nor shall any such company subject any particular person or
company or any particular description of traffic to any undue or unreasonable
prejudice or disadvantage in any respect whatsoever.?
It will be observed, and in considering the subject should be carefully
borne in mind, that a preference in itself is not necessarily illegal; it is
only when ic becomes undue or unreasonable that it is so. It may be well
in this connection to refer to three words employed in connection with
this subject, and which, in many cases, are used as if they were interchange-
able. The words referred to are ? preferential,? ? differential,? and ? dis-
crimination.? The two latter words, so far as this subject is concerned, are
interchangeable, but the words ? preferential ? and ? differential,? though
having some points in common, are in this connection to be carefully dis-
tinguished. When equal mileage rates proved in practice unworkable
differential rates necessarily were substituted, and so long as such rates
applied generally and in all cases, they could in no sense be termed pre-
ferential. Immediately any variation of these conditions in respect of rates
arose such became preferential, and then it remained to be proved whether
they were undue or unreasonable. It will be evident that different rates
might be made for equal mileage, but over another instead of the same
portion of a line, and consequently a general differential rate might be-
come, under particular circumstances, a preferential rate. The position,
then, appears to be that all preferential rates are differential rates, but
that all differential rates are not necessarily preferential. Further, as pre-
viously stated, all preferential rates are not necessarily illegal or unjust.
There are two expressions in the clauses referred to that require explanation.
The reference is to goods, and the words are ? same description ? and
? same circumstances.? The words ? same description ? do not mean that
the goods must be identical or similar, but that in the matter of risk and
expense of carriage they are the same. The words ? same description ? have
been ruled to apply where, in dealing with goods, the labour, risk, and
expense of carriage to the company are the same.
The legislation to date is provided for in the Traffic Act of 1888. The
following additions and variations are therein enacted: In previous legisla-
tion it was necessary that a complainant against a preferential rate, who.


to prove prejudice, must show competition in interest, and to obtain redress
should be able to prove personal loss, but in the act of 1888 local authori-
ties, associations or traders, and chambers of commerce and agriculture,
who of course could not show personal loss, were empowered to make com-
plaint. Further, that, in all cases, the proof that a lower charge or difference
in treatment does not amount to an undue preference lies on the railway.
Previously the onus of proof rested with the complainant; also that, even
in the event of a preferential rate being adjudged undue or unreasonable,
it would not necessarily be deemed illegal if it is satisfactorily proved that
its continuance is in the public interest ?such, for instance, as givmg tie
public the full benefit of rival routes or mode of transit,?and, finally, that
no distinctions are permitted to be made for the carriage of home and
foreign merchandise. Such are the leading features of the latest legislation.
To complete this branch of the subject the clauses of the United States
Inter-State Commerce Act of 1887 relating thereto are here added with
the explanation that prior to that date any complaints made in that coun ry
as to preferential or prejudicial treatment by the carriers were decided
almost entirely upon common law principles.
Section 2 . . , ~
That if any common carrier, subject to the provisions of this act, shall,
directly or indirectly, by any special rate, rebate, drawback, or other
device, charge, demand, collect, or receive from any person or persons
a greater or less compensation for any service rendered m the trans-
portation of passengers or property, subject to the provisions of this
act, than it charges, demands, collects, or receives from any other
person or persons for doing for him or them a like and contemporaneous
service in the transportation of a like kind of traffic under substantially
similar circumstances and conditions, such common carrier shall
deemed guilty of unjust discrimination, which is hereby prohibited
and declared to be unlawful.
Section 3
That it shall be unlawful for any common carrier, subject to the pro-
visions of this act, to make or give any undue or unreasonable pre-
ference or advantage to any. particular company, firm, cor*
poration or locality, or any particular description of traffic in any
respect whatsoever, or to subject any particular person, company, firm,,
corporation, or locality, or any particular description of traffic, to any
undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage in am respect
whatsoever. . ,
Every common carrier, subject to the provisions of this act, shall, accord-
ing to their respective powers, afford all reasonable, proper, and equal
facilities for the interchange of traffic between their respective lines
and for the receiving, forwarding, and delivering of passengers and
property to and from their several lines and those connecting there
with, and shall not discriminate in their rates and charges between
such connecting lines, but this shall not be construed as requiring any
such common carrier to give the use of its tracks or terminal facilities
to another carrier engaged in like business


.Section 4 ??
That it shall be unlawful for any common carrier, subject to 'the pro-
visions of this act, to charge or receive any greater compensation
in the aggregate for the transportation of passengers or of like kind
of property under substantially similar circumstances and conditions
for a shorter than for a longer distance over the same line in the same
direction, the shorter being included within the longer distance, but
this shall not be construed as authorising any common carrier within
the terms of this act to charge and receive as great compensation for
a shorter as for a longer distance. Provided however that upon ap-
plication to the commission appointed under the provisions of this
act such common carrier may in special cases, after investigation by
the commission, be authorised to charge less for longer than for
shorter distances for the transportation of persons or property, and
the commission may from time to time prescribe the extent to which
such designated common carrier may be relieved from the operation
of this section of this act.
The question of whether a rate is preferential or not is mainly one of
'fact, and the following are some of the leading principles on which a de-
-cision can be based :? ?
Competition of interest between complainant and the person alleged
to be unduly favoured must be shown.
The onus of proof that the advantage or prejudice is not undue or un-
reasonable is thrown upon the railway company.
Justification for a preferential rate may be established if it can be
shown that it is necessary in the public interest.
May also be justified if it can be shown that an adequate saving in cost
tc the railway can be made, for example, by securing full train loads
at regular times and for longer distances. The saving, however, must
be on the carriage of the actual traffic for which the preferential rate
is granted.
'Cannot be justified simply on the ground that a threat has been made
to withdraw the traffic and find other means of transport.
May be justified on the ground that competition has rendered it neces-
sary to secure the traffic.
May be justified on the ground that similar terms are open to all, irrespec-
tive of whether they are or are not useless to a complainant.
A complainant may not be able to successfully claim a preferential rate
if it can be shown that the rate he has been charged will thereby be
unduly reduced.
There are other minor principles which cannot be enumerated within
d;he limits of this article.
This leads to the consideration of the clauses in the local Commonwealth
Act bearing on the subject, and for the administration of which mainly the


proposed Inter-State Commission is to be appointed. Ihe clauses referred
to are as follow :
Clause 102. ?The Parliament may, by any law with respect to trade or
commerce, forbid as to railways any preference or discrimination by
any State or by any authority constructed under a State if such preference
or discrimination is undue or unreasonable or unjust to any State, due
regard being had to the financial responsibilities incurred by any State
in connection with the construction and maintenance of its railways,.
but no preference or discrimination shall, within the meaning of this
section, be taken to be undue and unreasonable or unjust to anj State
unless so adjudged by the Inter-State Commission.
Clause 104. ?Nothing in this Constitution shall render unlawful any rate
for the carriage of goods if the rate is deemed by the Inter-State Com-
mission to be necessary for the development of the territory of the
State and if the rate applies equally to goods within the State and to
goods passing into the State from other States.
It will be observed by the italicised portion oi clause 102, and the whole
of clause 104, that the Commission will, in addition to the duty of de-
ciding whether or not rates are preferential, probably on the principles pre-
viously herein laid down, also require, further, to take into account the
financial responsibilities in connection with railways of the State against
which complaint may be made, but also a States policy with regard to the
development of its territory. These considerations will probably make the
task of the Commission a most difficult one, and will no doubt materially
affect the decisions.
Conclusion.
An endeavour has been made to indicate the subjects which will come
within the scope of the proposed Inter-State Commission. The manner
in which the similar commissions of Great Britain and America deal with
such matters has also been briefly shown, but before concluding it may be
emphasised that to deal effectively and justly with the incidence of preference
rates is really the reason of the existence of such commissions. None other
than an independent l>ody could deal with the subject; for, while sue
bodies will deal with a variety of other subjects, none of these are of such a
nature or intricacy as could not be solved fairly and equitably by t e
administrative officers of the railways or other means of communication.
As has been pointed out, preferential rates are not necessarily illegal, but
the line of demarcation betweenTegal and illegal preference rates is, o en
times, so fine that, to hold the balance evenly between the parties con-
cerned, a semi-judicial, disinterested body is squired to decide matters.
Now, let an endeavour be made to state the case clearly. Iho purpose
of the commission is to regulate the trade and commerce of the various
States of Australia. It should be clearly understood that this does not in


the slightest degree affect or interfere with the ordinary purchasing and
selling of merchandise; with such transactions the Inter-State Commission
will have no power to interfere. There is an unwritten and unexpressed
idea that, after such transactions take place, the completion of the
business by distribution and deliver}- of the goods sold to the purchaser, or
to his order, is of secondary importance. In reality, however, the business
of distributing and delivering the goods is almost of equal importance
with their sale and purchase, and consequently, its regulation is of great
importance. When it is taken into consideration that the cost of transport,
together with the character of the facilities provided therefor, and the time
required to complete it may determine the possibility or otherwise of
profitably cultivating the soil or manufacturing from raw r materials, it will
be at once apparent the important part the cost and means of transport
play in the business of a country. The means of transport are, as a rule,
the property of persons or corporations not directly interested in the pursuits
of the cultivation of the soil or of manufactures, and, consequently, not
directly interested in the success or otherwise of those who, as merchants,
sell and purchase the resulting commodities. The proprietors of the means
of transport will, therefore, endeavour to secure the largest amount they
possibly can for the services they perform, perhaps, if they axe short-sighted,
to the extent of curtailing the business, and, even if they recognise that the
benefits are mutual, may still, regardless of fairness or equity, try to obtain
the largest share of the available margin of profit. It is just at this point
that the duties of an independent commission?to see that the interests
axe conserved of all parties concerned?come into prominence. Now, who
are the parties concerned? Clearly the producers and manufacturers, the
consumers, and the persons interested in the point or place of distribution.
It will be found that the merchant, in this business, is really of comparatively
minor importance; he is simply the medium of distribution, whose action
hardly affects the value of the merchandise as compared with the person
who controls the transport of it. It will, therefore, be observed that the
interests of all parties concerned can be adversely, or otherwise, affected by
the action of the proprietors of railways or other means of transport. Mer-
chandise of practically no value at one place may, by the assistance of the
owner of the means of transport, be made valuable at some other point.
Whatever charge, therefore, is fixed for transport will affect the cost to the
consumers?the ultimate object of all business?and, consequently, affect
every be ng in the community.
It is obvious, therefore, that the Inter-S!ate Commission will have large
and far-reaching duties and powers, affecting every person and place in
Australia. To rise to the full height of its duty, it will require to see that
all the means of interchange are of the best, that every mode of transport ox
facility connected therewith, whether railway, road, canal, port, light, tele-
graph, etc., are up to date and, consistent with good service, are cheap to
the users thereof; further, that the full value of State or geographical claims
on behalf of any locality are duly weighed and credit given.
The general conditions and circumstances of the case in Australia, more
especially with respect to railways, should now be looked at.


Owing to the absence of great rivers, railways come into greater
prominence here than in any other part of the world.
As has been previously pointed out, the radical difference between the
internal transport arrangements of Great Britain and the United States of
America, as compared with those of Australia, is that in the last named
country, railways are the property of the Stale, as against private ownership
in the former countries. It may be asked if this really affects the question,
and, probably, it does not, for the following reasons: In the case of the
railways privately owned, the dividend paying qualification of the property
is of the first concern to the owners, and they are, apparently, not directly
interested in the quick development of the country, for if they can) get as
much profit for the carriage of one ton of goods ast for that of two tons of
goods, then they are not directly interested in the production of the second
ton. The limit of the demand for the goods does not, therefore, affect them.
Enlightened self-interest will, however, eventually teach private owners of
the means of transport that the full development of the country is to their
advantage. The object of the State in retaining possession of its railways
should be to use them as a means of developing the country, and, therefore,
the dividend-paying capacity of the property is not really a factor in the
business. Should working expenses and interest be paid, or during the
development not even so much as that, such result ought to be regarded as
a satisfactory state of affairs. The ultimate object, therefore, of each
party, whether private owner or the State, is the same. It would thus
appear that the duty of an Inter-State Commission, so far as a privately-
owned railway is concerned, is to see that, having regard to the development
and progress of a country, the interest of the owners is considered,
whereas in dealing with the State-owned railways of Australia, it has to see
that the administration of the railways of each State is so managed that
it will not injuriously affect the interest of any other State, leaving the
progress of the country entirely in the hands of the Federal Government.
It is evident that the proposed Inter-State Commission, when appointed,
will have great, important, and arduous work before it, and its influence
and work, wisely conducted, will affect for good the destiny of the coming
Australian nation.
This treatise on the subject has been written in the hope that it may be
found useful to those persons who may take an interest in the subject, and
perhaps, to those gentlemen, who, honoured by the electors of the States
with seats in the Senate and the House of Representatives, will have the
responsibility of appointing the Inter-State Commission as well as of passing
the Act under which that body will carry out its duties and powers.
