The Federal Steeplechase
ON THE 20th JUNE, 1899.
By EDWARD TERRY, M.L.A.
I TOOK a seat to ride tor the Federal Steeplechase, on the 20th Jane. It
was a race tor the Federal goal, and the prize an Empire. There were a number
of stables represented, the principal ones being Self's, Provincialist's, Position's
and Sydney’s, besides two Syndicates, which were known by the names of
Australia's and New South Wales' stables. I took note of most of the riders—
I myself was mounted on a horse called INDEPENDENCE. He was by Patriot, out

There were a host of otters, which I had not time to take a note of before we
left the enclosure which had been put up for the owner. There were many
thousands to see the start, and various were the comments both on horses and
riders. It would take me too long to repeat the remarks I heard. lam not a
betting man, so paid no attention to the odds given.
Our orders were to take the jumps between the flags, every obstacle having
two flags on it, about one hundred yards apart. The start was a good one,
Federation and The Premier leading the field and Wait-a-Bit bringing up the
rear. The first fence was a “ rasper.” It was the fence between the People’s
Commons and the Senators’ Estate. Anti-Federal, Provincialist and Truth came
to grief over it. There were others who baulked and ran round. I had hard
work to keep Independence straight, foi Daily Telegraph crossed him and took
the fence sideways right against the flag, going very awkwardly—all over the
blooming country like a horse without a rider. It was not safe to be near him.
I was certain he would come to grief and put others out of it. The Premier* was
now close alongside Federation’s quarters, and in much the same order were the
second and third fences negotiated. I saw Entangle, Concern and Fits without
riders. The fourth obstacle was a bullfinch (i.e., a neglected hedge of large and
awkward proportions), going into Braddon’s Park. Daily Telegraph here joined
the Premier, and looked to me as if he was doing his best to run him off or bring
him down. At this obstacle, Finance, Reclaimed and Selector joined me and we
raced at the rasper side by side. Independence brushed through and nearly came
down. Geebung broke his neck. Unification landed fair in the middle, and his
rider must have been badly pricked with the thorns. I saw him scramble out
on the other side with his colors all torn to shreds. There were several obstacles
to take in the Park before we came out of it. Superior put his foot in a hole and
gave his rider a nasty purl. The sixth obstacle was a wide ditch with a bad
take-off Over this Socialist came to grief. We had now a clipped hedge.
Barrister was the first over. The Premier, Daily Telegraph, and Federation
were in close attendance in the order named. Then we had a three-railer with a
gutter in front. Wait-a-Bit blundered and fell into the fence, carrying away
three or four panels. The next was a wide water jump. Sunday Trader landed
in the middle of it, giving his rider a ducking. Then State-Rights’ Stone Wall
blocked the way. Daily Telegraph was first at the wall, but ran round, clearing
out with Cary, who had lost all control of him. He nearly brought The Premier
to grief. He raced into the Black Swamp, and he and his rider were helplessly
bogged. Platform and The Joker came to mother earth over this wall. We had
about half a mile to go through the Capital Forest, in which Blarney, Con-
firmation and Debate parted company with their riders. When we emerged
from the forest the goal was in sight. We had to go through a ploughed field
with a three-railer in and out, before we got into the straight running. Surmount
came down l*u the last fence. The few that remained in the field were well
together and it looked like a desperate race for the finish. The whips were drawn
and we sat down and rode for our natural. As we neared the goal I heard a roar
of noises, in which I caught the words —“ The Premier wins !” “ Federation ! ”
“Barrister!” “Elocution!” “Independence!” And just as I was on the
post I heard a crash ! bang! and I awoke and found—“ ’Twas but a dream !”
