I Cairns Innisfail Babinda Herberton 1
THE sentiment couched in those immortal lines “The best laid
plans of mice and men gang aft agley, ” unconsciously suggests
itself to one when viewing the scene where the winds of Heaven
have laid waste vast tracts of country, more especially if whole
townships have come within the scope of their force, and the
place where, a few hours previous, a thriving town existed, now lies a
desolate seene of wreckage and ruin, with homeless beings and animals
wandering aimlessly about. It is a forlorn picture; years of work and
savings lost, with evidence of domestic life and handicraft scattered
everywhere, and accentuated with cases of maimed and dead victims
precariously attended to by willing helpers. Such were the impressions
of those who witnessed the effects of the recent cyclone.
On Sunday morning, March 10, 1918, the various centres of North
Queensland received the following information from the Astronomical
Bureau, Brisbane Disturbance this morning N.B. from Townsville,
and approaching the coast between Cooktown and Bowen. It appears
to be dangerous.’ 7 Although the day broke forth in the Cairns district
with no indications of any serious atmospheric disturbances pending, by
noon a strong wind had sprung up which increased in velocity as the day
wore on, and about 4 p.m. came the final word from the Bureau The
new disturbance is a dangerous cyclone. The centre at 3 p.m. to-day is
East from Cairns, probably less than seventy miles. It is apparently
moving south-westwards. Advise the public urgently.”
By nightfall pelting rain accompanied by heavy wind had set in,
with the barometer falling at an alarming rate, and it was apparent to
everyone that the district was in for a cyclone of unusual violence.
Although the residents of various centres had received warning
there was little to be done —just wait for results and hope for the best.
By 9 p.m. the cyclone had almost reached its full fury, and even the
most substantial wooden buildings were vibrating under the strain, the
barometer having fallen at Innisfaii to the lowest recording point, and
telegraph communication between the various towns had become dis-
organised. Buildings were beginning to crumble under the sudden strong
gusts and trees were either stripped of their foliage or uprooted, whilst
whole tracts of jungle and acres of cane was laid hat. Three large railway
carriages at Babinda were turned over, as though they were mere toys,
without even breaking the couplings.


Terrible as the cyclones of the past thirty years have been this
one, at its height, seems to have surpassed anything in human memory.
Persons who have been through ‘ ‘ Sigma' 1 and ‘ ‘ Leonta' ’ say that this,
though shorter in duration, was more appallingly violent than either.
By midnight on the 11th the storm had partially abated, and
daybreak dawned on a scene of ruin (notably in and around Innisfail,
Babinda, Herberton and Cairns). Cairns was most fortunate in not ex-
periencing the full force of the cyclone; one or two buildings collapsed,
a number were unroofed, and some shade trees uprooted.
Innisfail and district was practically demolished, even brick and
concrete buildings succumbing to the terrific force of the wind. Babinda,
with the exception of a few dwellings, was likewise razed to the ground,
even the substantial building of the State Hotel suffering considerably.
Herberton and Gordonvale were also more or less affected. Thrilling
tales of narrow escapes both on land and on water were not uncommon,
and nearly a score of deaths were recorded.
The following extract from the “Cairns Post” vividly describes
some of the incidents of the cyclone at Innisfail, and this description
would apply to anywhere in the track of the cyclone :
“ The scene on Monday morning was woeful in the extreme. The
dense jungle which used to cover the slopes and ridges, and stretched
in belts over the plains, has now the appearance of dry brushwood or
a ring-barked forest. There is hardly a leaf on any of the trees, but
here and there the dishevelled tuft of a palm waves disconsolate over a
scene that suggests the depth of a European winter. Not merely are the
trees stripped of their leaves and reduced to an aspect torn and grotesque,
with ragged stumps of branches —reminding one of Dorc’s illustration of
the lost souls in the inferno flying from the avenging demons and yet
rooted to the ground against their will —but actually in many instances
the very bark is torn clean away as it is from English oaks that are peeled
as they stand for the benefit of the tanneries before the sawyer fells
them. Individual examples of the storm’s violence makes one wonder
how it was that the deaths were not far more numerous. Here is a house
that was sheltering forty people, when it was torn from its 10ft. blocks
and tossed into the garden. Here is another large house that was carried
bodily across the road and deposited on the opposite block, 90ft. away.
Here is a kitchen stove, weighing 2cwt. or more, flung from a ruined
house, 70ft. into the middle of the road, and from the opposite side, car-
ried by the return blast of the storm, is the whole side of a house that
has been lifted from its base, hurled over the fence, and laid flat in
company with the debris from across the way. Fragments of chairs, cup-
boards, dressers, twisted iron, broken crockery, gas generators, tattered
clothes and curtains, lie about in heaps. Tanks, though quite full, were
carried from their stands. The empty ones performed strange feats.
One bowled down the slope to the Jonhstone River, skimmed and rolled
across the hundred yards of water, and ascended the opposite bank.
In the main street few buildings are even recognisable.”
It is to be hoped that the North will never experience another
visitation like this one.
