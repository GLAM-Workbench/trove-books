TO MY MOTHER




PREFACE
IF the reader should feel inclined to see a
touch of modernity in Spina’s jibes at
logic, I may here observe that the academic
thought of any age is largely forestalled by
human savoir. And indeed Spina might have
quoted waggishly from Dante:
“ O insensata cura de’ mortali,
Quanto son difettivi sillogismi !
[Farad. XL)
just as in his day Dante had in mind the words
of Lucretius:
“ O miseras hominum mentes ! O pedlora caeca ! ”
Etc.
(Lib. II.)
The important fadl of to-day is that with
the lessening of our contadl with nature We
b


have allowed our vitality to be absorbed by
mental activity, with the result that values
have become confused for us. The best office
of a good play is to emphasize the permanent
and the valuable.

THE HAPPY KINGDOM
ACT I
Scene i. The Council Chamber in the Royal Palace ,
Enter Valerio, Egidio, Dolcibene,
and Alfonso.
Dolcibene.
OU must be spokesman, noble sir.
Valerio. Not I.
Egidio.
You are our senior by a many years.
Valerio.
I’ll not be told so. If I count more age
By weeks or months, it comes by accident,
And is no fault of mine. Shall that suffice
To set me tilting at a peaceful King
Till that he wed some jade and get him sons
Who may dispute the sceptre of this isle
B


When he is dead ? There are enough young men
Already in the world to grow gray hairs,
And nurse the gout, and crack with lumbar pains.
I see no good in all this population.
If God needs angels—
Egidio. Nay, Valerio, nay!
Valerio.
I say if God needs angels—
Dolcibene. What, a plague—
Alfonso.
Signor Valerio hath philosophy
In all he says, but—
Valerio. If God needs more angels
Humanum genus is a sorry stud,
The earth doth breed them badly; and if not,
Then why create more sinners to be damned ?
Alfonso.
You see but one part in a complex whole.
Valerio.
When I was young, sir, I had all your follies.
I have made seven sinners. ’Tis enough.
I’ll urge the King to none.


Alfonso. Sir, as you will.
But soft, here comes the King.
Enter King
King. Good morrow all.
Dolcibene.
Good morrow to your Grace.
King. We are here met
To give consideration to the state
Of our succession, in regard to which
Ye know what should be known: our ancient law
Refuses right of regiment to my child
For that she is a woman, and no son
Have I, nor queen to bear me one; whence comes
The sad predicament that should I die
All unprovided as I am with kin,
Our sunny island is, as ’twere, at sea
Without a pilot, and by every rule
Of worldly precedent must stand the shocks
Of tyrannous and plundering buccaneers.
You also know my mind, which is my heart,
For I have reigned as father, and do love
To think my people firm in happiness—
Wherefore to gain their settlement and peace
I yield myself, as you shall answer me.


Dolcibene.
We can but give opinion to your Grace,
And for myself I see an easy way
In following nature’s course, and so you please,
To take some royal lady for your queen
With every prospe<sl of an early heir.
King.
It hath the virtue of simplicity.
Egidio.
And much shrewd aptness to the case in hand.
Valerio.
Unless the sons prove girls, or die in youth,
Or being grown to manly dignity
Become contentious and divide the land
With internecine slaughter. ’T has been done.
King.
Ay, what has not! We come upon the scene
Too late to plan new means, but in our choice
May use the old with judgment.
Dolcibene. As your Grace
In every matter doth.


Egidio. Which I’ll be sworn.
Valerio.
I can bethink me of an ancient means
To raise an heir for you, without the harm
That might affray so fast a widowhood,
Which is, let youngsters marry and beget.
Your noble daughter, though she may not rule,
May pass the sovereign rights unto her son
And in event of hard necessity
Become co-regent with him.
King. True, she may.
What say you, sir, to that? [To Alfonso
Alfonso.
My liege, if I have any mind at all
In what concerns so admirable a lady,
I do confess I think she hath a scorn
Above all possible suitors for her hand.
Were he a book, then she would dote on him,
Did he but bark or whinney she would cast
Her fondling arms about his hairy neck,
Were he a fipple-flute then would she touch
Her mouth to his with infinite sweet sounds,
But, being as she is, if he be man
She is no woman to be made his wife.


King.
We shall discover further from herself.
Ho, poursuivant! Go quickly and return :
The Lady Yaga wills to speak with us.
[Exit Poursuivant.
Dolcibene.
And if she will not, sir?
Valerio. Why, she will not.
But if she say she will not, ’tis no let;
She will.
Alfonso.
Nay, that’s not clear to me.
King. My lord,
My good Valerio, you are still at feud
With yestereven’s dinner, are you not?
Valerio.
My King, my gracious liege, I am but love
Compounded cunningly in all my frame,
But for my dinner of last Sunday week
It is still here and sends me messages,
Which of a surety I could gladly spare.
I would I were a beggar with a crust


And twenty appetites. I say I would;
Ay, and without or crust or appetite
Could I be quit of heartburn and this wind.
King.
Try solfanello water, good my lord.
Valerio.
lam tanned with it; ’tis as morning dew;
It oozes from my fingers and my toes,
My elbows and eye sockets, all my bones
Are yellow as a cowslick with the stuff,
But for the good I get of it, cock’s pots!
St. Damianus and my wife do know.
King.
How doth your wife, my lord ?
Valerio.
As well, I think, as women do at large;
Though being large she doth not over well.
King.
And mean you large with promise, good my lord ?
Valerio.
Your Grace, I do, which promise she will keep.
Beshrew the man that having reached gray hairs


Must wive a lass again. ’Tis nature’s jest.
Enter Vaga.
Good morrow, madam.
Vaga. Good morrow, noble sirs.
My father I have greeted hours agone
While ye were lie-a-beds. We rose to loose
Our pretty tumbling pigeons while the sky
Was pink and all the earth still hushed and cool.
That was a sight, and music too to hear!
King.
It was, my chick, but we must reason now
Of matters which, belike, will like you less.
These noble signors, council of my realm,
With worthy eye to what imports her good
Have fittingly besought me to provide
An heir to the succession. By our law
This heir must be a son, and by the force
Of natural logic either I or thou
Must be the parent of him. So it stands.
Vaga.
Then sad Sardinia that must lack an heir!
And no more story to it.
King. Were our state


But happy freedom I should choose so too,
Since all the happiness my soul can crave
I have already in my people’s good
And thy most sweet affedlion ; but the choice
Of easeful citizens is not for us,
Who for the honours of our kingly place
Must render meed in duties; lor thou
Must give this isle a prince, this realm an heir.
Forbear a while! If I should wed again,
Despite my vows upon your mother’s grave,
Such clouds might blow into thy summer sky
As should o’ercast thy simple happiness,
Since mothers are but mothers to their own.
But in the sunshine of a husband’s love
Thy heart which is so perfect in the bud
Would open to the flower of womanhood
With no joy left unproven.
Dolcibene. Prettily said!
And true.
Vaga. If it should be these councillors
Are banded in the plot to marry me,
I’ll not be party to it, nor grant mine ears,
Nor stay discoursing of such delicate things
As baby princelings. Doth my face not burn ?
Fie, signor Dolcibene! What a trick!


To waste such precious and delightsome hours
In talking of a husband, while the bay
Is dancing blue and golden and the gulls
Dip in their claws and scream and circle off.
Adown there waits a tunny large as thou
Which at to-morrow’s sunrise I shall take
With a fine hook my Spina makes for me,
While ye are scheming. No, I’ll not be wife.
Valerio. [Aside to Alfonso.]
Why she would take her man, come priest come
ladder.
I know that kind of filly. Catch and hold!
King.
My noble lords, I thank you heartily
For all your careful and much valued help.
I would be left in private with my daughter,
That I may somewhat press the argument
Of her dear duty to her father’s prayer.
I beg you therefore make a circuit round
My new rose alley, and return betimes.
Dolcibene.
Come, lords, a walk will give us appetite.
Valerio.
If so, I’ll say God loves me after all. [Exeunt.


King.
This is a happy kingdom. Never once
In all my reign of half a hundred years
Has our gold eagle heard the sound of war,
Or treason, discord or mute ill-content
Been seen within the circle of our coasts.
The day may not be near, yet ’tis not far,
When I must in the course of nature go,
To where my fathers keep their silent state,
And having none to take the sceptre up
Our ancient house comes sharply to an end,
And all the gains of my laborious life
Fall toppled over headlong, spreading ruin
Among the homes of happy industry.
Once let this people know the will to choose,
Disaster follows in the clash of wills,
And then the base adventurer plunges in
And with his ruthless hands plucks all for prize.
Which must not be. Not love alone, but sense,
Cries out and tells us that in must not be.
And deep reproaches in my heart I have
For that mine eyes, all blinded by my love,
Too long have missed the tally of thy years
And called thee child when thou wast rather
woman.
Deal not my fault too stern a punishment;


Be duteous to thyself, and with the crown
Of wifely motherhood secure our realm.
Yaga.
Dear father, all the motherhood I know
Is what thy fondness daily teaches me,
At thought of which I would make due return,
And yet I cannot lie, or cheat myself,
Or make me other than I know I am.
I cannot vow to love when I most hate
That men should venture near me. Out beyond
There waits a silvery tunny; let me go
And see what hook my Spina’s skill hath made.
King.
Wrath comes but slowly to me; yet beware,
I do not brook evasion. Think awhile!
Yaga.
I cannot think. I find no thoughts to think.
The matter doth not enter me.
King. Heigh ho!
Re-enter Nobles.
Dolcibene.
The red rose opens bravely.


Yaga. Ay, my lord,
It hath a flaunting and a tyrannous air
That feeds my fancy.
King. Good my noble sirs,
The lady’s fancy runs but on such food.
She doth displease me in her stubborn frame.
Egidio.
And yet such honours well become her years,
To take a royal husband.
Dolcibene. And a rich!
A tall, well favoured, hearty gentleman.
Yaga.
I beg you cease!
Dolcibene. Nay rather I would add
The proper qualities of such a prince,
And pidure him most valiant and full strong,
A man of metal, and withal most kind,
A Mars, and yet Apollo, and for wit
A nobler Mercury, and for wisdom Jove.
A very paragon of princely parts.
Yaga.
A Mars, Apollo, Mercury, and Jove!


Were such disorders tumbled into one
Our laws would banish him!
Dolcibene. I mean —
Vaga. Nay, nay,
I do entreat of you.
Valerio. The lady’s age
Is ripe for marriage; ’tis her father’s wish
That she should marry; then no more ado.
The King can find some passable youth for her
And she will dote on him like any wife.
But Mars, Apollo, Neptune, Cerberus,
With Gog and Magog—Heaven proted us all!
The whole trick lies in old mortality;
For which I say: Praise God. We’ll see her yet
Lean arm in arm with him.
Vaga. My lord Valerio!
Valerio.
And proud as any woman!
Vaga. Hush, my lord!
Valerio.
My lady, I’ll not hush. It is the height
Of our nobility to be ourselves.


And you are not yet yourself till you have found
That better part which still remains upscaled.
My bones will not be buried till I see
Your loving gaze into a prince’s eyes.
Vaga.
When I so gaze, I vow to wed the man.
Valerio.
You will, my royal mistress, that you will.
Vaga.
Though he should be a beggar, him I’ll wed!
Valerio.
And him you’ll fondle too!
King. Ay, that 1 know!
Vaga.
If I should leave my hand to stay a while
At greeting or at parting, God’s my judge,
I’ll make him husband in the nearest church.
Valerio.
I have five daughters older than your years,
And seven hulking sons. I’ve wed them all,
And all have thanked me for it!


Vaga. So may I,
When I have lost my reason.
Valerio. Or your heart.
Vaga.
Which I have none, perchance!
Valerio. For sure you’ve not.
Vaga.
How know you that ?
Valerio. It only comes by losing.
Vaga.
How know you ’tis not lost?
Valerio. You have it not.
Vaga.
That is round arguing!
Valerio. Nay, it is a truth
Of which I show both sides. The world is round,
But no less fast for that; and lovers call
Each cheek the other, for when each is kissed
It leaves the other. ’Tis love’s Chapter 1.,
And down about the seventh paragraph!


Vaga.
You are a book, my lord.
Valerio.
You are a woman, my lady.
Vaga.
I thank you, my lord.
Valerio.
Nay, thank God, my lady.
Vaga. [ Less confidently .]
I do thank Him for everything, my lord.
Valerio.
By which you leave the matter, good my lady.
King.
Our purpose doth not vantage in this wise!
Valerio.
Not so, your grace, our purposes are won.
The lady Vaga, with most willing heart,
Doth swear to take the man whom she will love,
In which I see not one but many heirs,
And therefore do I cry: Long live Sardinia!
c


Enter Poursuivant.
PoURSUIVANT.
My liege, His Grace the Duke of Mantua,
Knight banneret of the Empire’s Golden Fleece,
High lord of Pesaro and of Imola,
Doth send his greetings and hath passed the gate.
King.
Go, say we do attend him eagerly!
[Exit Poursuivant.
I know not why his visit doth arouse
So little joy in me. ’Tis roundabout
To make for Sicily by calling here,
And savours of some shrewd diplomacy.
Therefore give good attention to his words
And note what words are missing. Come, my lords!
[ Exeunt .
Enter Spina singing.
Spina.
Heigh ho, merry and bright!
That is the woe of the weary wight.
Yaga.
What means your song, Spina?


Spina.
Nothing, madam, ’tis a song.
Yaga.
Should a song mean nothing?
Spina.
Nothing out of the song. Otherwise it were best
to lack the music and be a sermon.
Yaga.
What then of this weary wight ?
Spina.
Less than nothing, my lady. ’Tis an ancient word
that I make much use of in my ditties; being sad
it lies to hand for foolery.
Yaga.
Was that song foolish?
Spina.
Nay, my lady, it was a tickling of the inner ear
which hath its own melodies. Results we strive
for; for the how , no matter. But in all cases ’tis
but wisdom that is foolish, and foolery is wisdom
set in order. Ow!


Vaga.
What ails ?
Spina.
Fourscore inches of the best fishhook lying bedded
in a jester’s thumb. Adieu, my lute, I shall not
stroke thee more!
Vaga.
Let me dislodge it.
Spina.
Not so, an you love me, for when the hook is out
the blood will follow, which being seen upon your
dress, an a merchant be found with his throat slit
you may be hanged for it.
Vaga.
I prithee.
Spina.
Nay, do not prithee me. Each man must do his
own dying! ’Tis his manly right.
Vaga.
My fingers have some steadiness; I can withdraw
it with less pain than thou.


Spina.
Then look thou touch me not, for being ticklish 1
should die of laughter. But no, I wrest it forth
myself.
Vaga.
Oh gently! I will bind it.
Spina.
Not in my waking moments, lady, for I’ll be bound
by no woman.
Yaga.
Now you make mock of me! Why call you me a
woman ?
Spina.
Take no hurt of it, madonna. I cannot quit this
aptness.
Vaga.
One other called me so a moment gone.
Spina.
No grievous matter!
Vaga.
Yet I like it not.


Spina.
Off with his head!
Vaga.
Nay, now I know you mock. I gave no cause
For such misprision, nor I give no leave!
Sir jester, you are free! And learn resped:!
[Spina moves away.
My tunny hook goes with him in his thumb.
How, have I chid him ? I am churlish rough.
Come hither, Spina.
Spina. As my lady bids,
I come or go.
Vaga. I pray you pardon me.
Mine ears misled me.
Spina. I did mean no ill.
Vaga.
I know that ere thou sayest it.
Spina. ’Twas a whiff
Of blessed truth that turned a somersault
|Midway betwixt and reached you upside down.
Vaga.
We’ll say it was so if you pardon me.


I spake unkindly. Let me draw the barb,
And with this ribbon tie the wound up tight.
[Spina bares his thumbs which is seen to
be unharmed.
Spina.
Mine eyes deceived me. It hath slipped my hold.
\He stoops and picks the hook up from the
floor.
Here is the varlet. Oh thou naughty hook, that
thus didst sommersault thyself away and make
bad blood between a humble jester and a high
princess. Thou shalt be whipped for it; thou shalt
be sent from the presence for it. Shall he not, my
lady? Thou shalt be put in strait jacket and treated
to high disdain. Shall he not, madam ? Thou shalt
be treated to the cold silence of a lively wrath.
Shall he not, madonna? Thou shalt be as thou
hadst no existence, as though thou drewst no breath
nor didst cast no shadow nor filledst no spot upon
the floor, as though thou wert less than a worm,
less than the trail of a slug, less than the epitaph
of a suicide, less than the memory of a jester to a
royal princess.
Vaga.
Forbear !


Spina.
He hath deserved my wrath. It was a mockery of
me to prick me to the marrow and then skip off so
privily without leave taking. Yet he is beautiful.
Is he not, my lady ? He is sleek and cunningly to
the point. Is he not, madonna ? He is single in
purpose, sober in manner, high in sentence and
stiff i’ the backbone of his resolutions. Is he not,
princess ?
Yaga.
Forbear! I do entreat you to forbear! Shall I not
be forgiven ? The hook is wondrous beyond word
of praise. 1 thank you freely for it!
Spina.
’Tis a passable hook.
Yaga.
A marvel!
Spina.
Not ignominious for the length of his nose.
Yaga.
It is beauteously made!
Spina.
Meritoriously.


Vaga.
More than meritoriously!
Spina.
As I might say, meritevolissimably.
Vaga.
Oh more, more still, far more.
Spina.
No, I stop there. That is sufficient for a bent wire
reddened under a kettle and chilled in sealing wax.
I hold not, mark you, with the cheapening of titles.
Vaga.
What mean you by that ?
Spina.
I’ faith what should I mean ? ’Tis a twisting or a
straightening out of something. There is some
greatness in it if we dodge the claptrap.
Vaga.
But what mean you by the cheapening of titles ?
Spina.
Mean ? I, mean ? Is that a kindness ? Should ye
call me mean who have this belfried crown, and
keep good company? Doth not a princess speak


with me? And ye call me mean! [Yaga is on the
point of bursting into tears and exit.~\ Do I not live
in mine own palace ? And ye call me mean! Have
I not sure and certain knowledge that I am the true
king ? And ye call me mean ! \_Looking rounds]
She loves me!
Now all ye angels that my guardians be,
Who till this hour—
Enter Poursuivant.
P OURSUIVANT.
I am sent to summon the princess.
Spina.
Then you are a summoner.
Poursuivant.
Is she not here ?
Spina.
Stay, I will search my pocket.
Poursuivant.
She is not here.
Spina.
Wait, give me time. N—no, 1 find her not. That
is the fate of summoners. Nail it on the door.


POURSUIVANT.
What?
Spina.
Which? How? Why? When? [ Taking him con-
One and a half, and one and a half,
the half of one, and one and a half. That’s five
among beans.
P OURSUIVANT.
Fool!
Spina.
Brevity is never politeness. I said it at greater
length.
P OURSUIVANT.
Pshaw! [Exit.
Spina.
As you will.
[ There is a fanfare of trumpets.
Enter the King, the Duke of Mantua and their
trains. Spina retires by a column.
King.
You miss the sun thus, by the northern porch,
And mount in greater comfort.


Duke. Kindly thought.
King.
This is my council chamber.
Duke. And most fit!
King.
Small, but sufficient for our island needs.
Duke.
I find it large, and rich in ornament.
Few kings can boast an equal.
Re-enter Poursuivant, followed by Yaga
and attendants.
King.
This is my daughter, sir, my prop, my stay,
My hope, my comfort and my dearer self!
Duke.
Ah, now you honour me beyond my thanks!
The world entire holds not another lady
That can be called a paragon to this!
[He kisses Yaga’s hand.
Dear madam—nay, I will not trust my tongue,
For praise must anger when the thing itself
So much o’ertops the highest note of praise.


Yet let me say that not a plunging gale
Hath racked my ship, but shall be held a boon
Since it hath served to bring me to this joy.
King.
The Duke most kindly comes to eat with us
At seven by the clock; be thou the wife
To see our dishes keep him.
Duke. Rather fear
I shall not find it in my heart to leave.
Yaga.
I would my merits did deserve so much.
Duke.
They do, and beggar me of words beyond.
King. [Espying Spina.]
This is my jester, sir.
Duke. Good morrow, sirrah.
Spina.
Ay, good enough for a Tuesday.
Duke. Excellent!
Spina.
This is my day of heaviest occupation.


Duke.
What is your task, lad ?
Spina. [Tawning.\ Ah, I wait for Wednesday.


Scene 2. A retainers corridor.
Enter the Master of the Musick with a fiddle ,
and musicians severally.
Master.
WHAT a plague! What a plague! Is there
no time by the clocks ? Is there no manners
nor respe6l of masters ? Have I not said ye were to
foregather here at such a time with your instru-
ments ?
2ND FIDDLE.
See you not I am here ?
Master.
I see you plainly, but where is flute and gamba-
fiddle ? Have they no ears for the clock-strike ?
2nd Fiddle.
I know naught of master flute and master gamba-
fiddle, but I do know master serpent hath his reed
cracked and will make him another ere he can blow
a crotchet down his spout. But here he is.
Master.
Serpent, have ye a new reed ready?


Serpent.
No.
Master.
Then pack and off with you. What will ye be
doing with a split tongue-piece at a king’s rehears-
ing ? Have ye no resped: ? Come ye to sit about
in the cool and talk ribaldry ? Off I say; I will cut
serpents from the king’s music and make shift
without you.
Serpent.
So you will hear yourself gesticulate I am pleased
enough, but I will bear no offence against my
tongue-piece. It is as excellent a tongue-piece as
ever gave pith to a poor band. Where were the
interest in these gnats and bumble-bees an you
lacked the honest squeal of the serpent! All’s one
with me: 1 will pack.
2nd Fiddle.
You ha’ made another.
Serpent.
I have made nothing !
Master.
Have ye a sound reed in your instrument ?


Serpent.
See you me here ? Am I come to make music ? Do
I blow a serpent with a crack in his wind ?
Master.
Gently, master gamba-fiddle. Ye had been better
come punctually by the clock.
2nd Fiddle.
You said ’twas cracked.
Serpent.
Who said it ? I ? Are you short of wits, man ?
Master.
Silence all of you! Here is your staves, which you
were best give eye to, though we are all at standstill
for the want of master flute.
Flute.
How want you me? I kept no concert waiting
since I was born, I am in tune with the fork, and
ready ere master scrape-gut yonder has his rosin
out.
Master.
Silence! We are all collected. Silence, gamba-fiddle,
till I have done my explaining. Could ye not have
put your string in ere ye came? This music is to
D


be especially solemn and state-like. It must be
rendered with a perfect union of parts as it were a
wheel turning with persistence, for of this regularity
proceedeth an enchantment suitable to state events
which are by nature remote from all passion. Ye
must not bend to any swelling effe&s which were
of romantics and lovers’ music, but continue steadily
as ’twere a procession of great persons above such
vanities. It must be tempo di passeggio , which is
largo robbed of the sententious, a kind of andante
modified to greatness and therefore fitting; and for
loudness it must be uniformly •voce da coro , which
is as it were forte with guts to it but no strepito.
The key is G major, and the counting four crotchets.
Now ye may fix new strings.
2nd Fiddle.
May we master it in half an hour ?
Master.
It is not for the revel, for which we play our
country music, but for the great banquet whereat
the princess will first wear queen’s jewels, and the
King hath told me personally with his own mouth
that he will have good and notable music new writ
for the occasion, which I have done at a sitting.
Therefore ye will play our country music at the


revel and immediately following will repair again
to this same spot for more rehearsing. There is to
be notables among us, and the King looks to us for
a good upholding of his honour. At seven o’ the
clock it must be played for the entry to banquet
hall, and again on rising, for it is of the occasion
and is proper to be repeated. Now take tune from
master flute.
Flute.
Why will the princess wear queen’s jewels?
Master.
Why? Because she hath a mind to. Give us the
note!
2nd Fiddle.
She hath twenty years in her hair and will adorn it.
Flute.
Twenty? She hath twenty-two. She was born the
day my wife died.
Master.
Are we to tune ? Or have we met to chatter ? Flute!
Flute.
I warrant I know how it runs. This Duke of


Mantua we must play before has been fetched
hither by the King, and to-night we hear announce-
ments. She will dance with him and smile upon
him, and he will give her a ring in public to our
melody. He was born fortunate!
Gamba-Fiddle.
Have we no blood here for her?
Master.
An ye blow us not the note, flute, I will pack up.
I will leave you to the King’s wrath. I will get me
fiddlers with a mind to fiddling!
Gamba-Fiddle.
We have as good blood here—
[Flute gives the note and they tune.


Scene 3. The garden by the western entrance. The
King, the Duke of Mantua and Vaga are
seated on rich chairs upon the steps , surrounded
by many of the court. Spina stands where he
can see the princess.
Enter Revellers who advance and salute
singly.
King.
It is our purpose to afford some mirth.
We cannot rival with your pageant shows,
Your music-dramas, or your tournaments,
But we can be ourselves, and make such sport
As with their humour likes our people best.
Duke.
I could prize nothing higher.
Vaga. You are kind.
Duke.
Nay, lady, I am happy, having all
That man can ask or kindness could bestow.
Vaga.
I think these revels foolish!


Duke. For you find
No newness in them.
Yaga. Mercy! I am tamed
To weariness before they can begin.
They are but artifice, and child’s pretence,
And have no matter in them for our souls.
Duke.
They aim at merriment.
Yaga. They give me none.
They spoil good grass with dancing.
Revellers.
All praises to our noble King,
And to his royal daughter,
And to the guest that he do bring,
The duke from over water.
[ They salute together.
King.
They are good people. Mark you now a custom.
I ask them simply of their play’s intent;
They answer with a showman’s rhyming couplets,
As though they had no other frame for speech.
How goes the plot, good fellows ?


Showman.
The plot we play before our King
And for the duke that he do bring
Is sweetly mixed with joy and mirth
As any plot that was on earth.
First shall ye see a maiden fair,
That hath some twenty summers clear,
Refuse to take herself a lord.
And scorn to leave her father’s board.
Then shall ye hear her father scream
And thrust her in the mountain stream,
Whereon the man who loved her best,
Full soon the mountain flood doth breast,
And he doth save the maiden fair,
And they are wed their joys to share.
King.
Oh, very admirable!
Duke. It is in truth,
And well spoke verses to proclaim it with.
I wish you good success with the enadment!
Showman.
We thank the noble duke for this,
And pray his life bring naught but bliss.


Duke.
He improvises with a master’s ease!
Showman.
And now, our lords, we will begin,
And round this plot our dance will spin.
[They dance together , the men at length
retiring.
Now doth the father tell the maid
That she should wed, but is gainsayed.
[The father dances to his daughter , who
will none of his meaning.
Now comes the woodman tall and strong,
The maiden sends him off along.
[The woodman is forced backward.
Now doth the charcoal-burner try,
For which he hath a blacker eye.
[The charcoal-burner is ill-used.
Now would the herdsman ask her hand;
She breaks his crook and gives command.
[The herdsman is repulsed with his crook
broken.


The cooper doth the maid assail;
She hides his head within his pail.
[ The cooper has his pail put about his ears.
The hardy soldier thinks him brave,
But headlong flies his skin to save.
[The soldier is put to flight.
The smith with grimy napron comes,
She nips him with his iron tongs.
[The smith withdraws squealing.
Next comes the baker in his cap ;
Whate’er he kneads he gets a slap.
Duke.
‘ Kneads ’ is magnificent!
King. Ay, pat indeed!
[The baker retires maltreated.
Showman.
Next comes the innman fat and round;
She trundles him upon the ground.
[ The innman is rolled off.
And last the father in his rage
Will see no more the battle wage.
[The father approaches angrily.


He takes her to the mountain stream
And casts her where she cannot swim.
[The father bears the maiden off and casts
her from him.
And now runs in the piping lad
Who passed for lazy and for mad;
[ The -piper enters hastily.
He breasts the flood and bears her out,
While gaping suitors raise a shout.
[The piper makes as swimming towards
her and carries her hack.
Here comes the priest and they are wed,
And all my rhymes are fully said.
We cry God give you strength alway,
And we will dance while ye will stay.
[The maiden and the piper are wedded.
The revellers dance about them.
Spina.
She writhes ! She writhes! She hath the barb right
home !
Good showman, that thou askedst mine advice,
Thou shalt be made a prince when I am king !
[The dance continues.
CURTAIN


ACT II




ACT II
Scene i. The royal kitchen. Scullions and
kitcheners discovered.
ist Scullion.
OW lads, now lads !
2nd Scullion.
By the smell o’ these pot-washings we are to see
good viands moving.
ist Scullion.
Ay, it be a potentious furrin duke o’ great pre-
scriptions.
2nd Scullion.
A will smack a’s lips then to a furrin tongue. I
would I could smack for him.
ist Scullion.
Thou for a duke indeed!
2nd Scullion.
Have I not the manner o’ it ? Can I not keep my
head up and mop my chin with a salvet ?


ist Scullion.
Thou ! Thou hast not the wording for a potentious
person. ‘ A will smack a’s lips,’ is no language
ducally.
2nd Scullion.
That was i’ the kitchen. I can pipe like a canary
an I give my mind to’t. I have pretty words enow,
I wurrant, and to spare too, when I be in good
mixings.
ist Scullion.
I pity you an you be mixed with a potentious
person. In especially for the comportment of table
manners, seeing thou dost feed thy face like a
beetle.
3rd Scullion.
Ah ha! Ah ha! Ah, my masters! Why, a beetle
feedeth not to a’s face; a doth stand over a’s food
like a plough ox.
ist Scullion.
To the exception of sea beetles, which is lobsters.
3rd Scullion.
Oh ay, true, the lobster feedeth to a’s face, so a
doth. But a lies to’t.


ist Scullion.
And so doth many a human mankind at his table,
in especially the potentious.
3rd Scullion.
I wurrant I be found at no table. An my knees be
not good enow ’twere to task the Almighty God
that made ’em. Ibe good church soul, I be; and a
soul that eats his own earning, so I be; and a soul
that begs nowt o’ salvets neither, so I be; and a soul
that so I come by a three legged stool, I be furnished,
I ha’ no place in my envy for an elbow rest. I knowt
a man that did owe a leg-break to a’s table; a was
returning in drink and forgotten it, and a’s leg was
broke i’ the knackle bane, which as some does call
the pan being as it is so brittle as a dish-pot.
2nd Scullion.
Ye knowed him not. I was at church myself when
it was preached on, but the point o’ the text was set
in wine spilling, not in tables.
3rd Scullion.
No, neither; I mind me fresher than ’twas now I
heard it, and the man as broke a’s pan did take it
that way, and sold a’s table, and doth drink merrily
and no more banes broken.


ist Scullion.
Well enough, well enough! But would ye have a
high duke eating from his knees like a varlet ?
Every man to his quality, say I.
2nd Scullion.
Ay, to a’s quality. Though for the merit of a’s
quality it be no more Christian than a poor man’s.
ist Scullion.
True; well spoke; very considerously spoke. But
I take nothing against quality, mark you!
3RD Scullion.
’Tis the difference atwixt thieves and lechers:
lechery be costly wickedness, fit for rich folk; and
thieving, which do be bread-winning, be best for
varlets and general poor men. But every man do
need a many masses; I’ve nowt against the world.
2nd Scullion.
True, as a world, which is to say mankind ; but for
rheumaticks and such other gifts of God, I like
not!
3rd Scullion.
Nay, God wot. Ah ha! Ah ha!


Enter Brocca.
ist Scullion.
Now, boys, good manners; this is the taster to the
furrin duke; therefore, good manners.
3RD Scullion.
A’s a prowler. A hath a mare’s eye. A will clot
the cook’s sauce with a’s finger.
ist Scullion.
Silent, lad! Good manners.
Enter Spina.
3rd Scullion.
There be a merry limb for a snatchet o’ melody.
A can turn a belching jaundice to a goat’s appetite.
\Bell sounds for menials' dinner.
Spina.
Now careful, my greasy heels, or you will lose your
slippers. They have small cares that can so run for
a dinner in a basin!
[Exeunt Scullions and kitcheners.
You are sir Brocca, the duke’s taster?
Brocca.
I am.
E


Spina.
I have your letter. None hear us; lam of good
faith.
Brocca.
Have you perused it ?
Spina.
Well and frequently.
Brocca.
Find you my meaning ?
Spina.
Readily: you hold a hand for money.
Brocca.
I offer something.
Spina.
F faith, treachery to your master !
Brocca.
From whom I learn it! And yet such treachery as
I purpose hath a salt of good in it, being in truth
a righting of great wrong.
Spina.
A worthy enterprise, without self-thought!


Brocca.
Even priests live by the altar.
Spina.
Quote me no scripture; you are not yet suspect.
Brocca.
Are you persuaded ?
Spina.
That the duke would kill me. But hurry to more
explanation; why comes he here ?
Brocca.
To wed the lady Vaga. Having heard
The story of your birth, and by some wind
Become acquainted with your present state.
His eye looks to his chance and off he sails
To win a wife and kingdom.
Spina. And the tale
He sudden learned; how went it?
Brocca. Briefly put,
Vittorio that was heir and only child
Of King Fernando, King Emanuel’s brother.
Was taken fighting for the Genoese


By scheming Milan, who, to work his spite,
And prick Sardinia into ruinous war,
Refused all ransom and confined the prince
In some most secret dungeon. Years wore on,
Fernando striving through the King of France,
Through Venice and the Pope, to win him back,
Till, learning of his falsely bruited death,
Himself died broken ; whereupon the throne
Passed to Fernando’s brother, King Emanuel.
Spina.
Who doth still hold it in this year of grace.
But falsely bruited death! How mean you that ?
Brocca.
That is the strangest of the history.
This prince Vittorio, for some shadowy plans,
Though robbed of liberty in the outer world,
Within his battlements was honoured much,
Lived happily and took himself a wife,
The daughter of a fellow prisoner,
A German ritter of some battle fame,
By whom he had a son.
Spina. Vittorio.


Brocca.
Yourself.
Spina.
And therefore heir.
Brocca. And therefore King!
Spina.
Hist! Every saucepan may upstore an echo
To leak when we are gone. Your story, sir,
Hath excellent bones and body, but no breath.
It is a charming composite of parts,
But no life in them. Granting I be son
Of this distressed Vittorio, what of proofs ?
For any man of wits will call for proof
Ere handing up a kingdom. Where is he?
Where is my father that did miss his crown ?
Brocca.
He died ere you had grown a memory.
Spina.
My mother too ?
Brocca. She too, and many more,
In one great swathe of the last pestilence.
Spina.
And I was left ? A toothless babe was left ?


Brocca.
You were in toddling skirts and left alive;
And for your gaolers were themselves struck down,
The secret of your birth did lose itself,
And such sweet charity as fed your cries
Was human pity, not a sop to rank.
Spina.
A soldier’s wife! Her man being at the wars,
She toiled for me and fed me with her own.
Oh wonderful work of God, angelic woman!
I do remember her, though if she died,
Or what became of her, I cannot tell.
But I remember that the door was set
At angles with the road, and she had hens,
And wore a crimson shawl and sang at nights,
And smelt like clover hay. Ah, what a fraud
Is this thing memory! Such is all I know
Of her whose sweat I would repay with love.
Brocca.
The soldier turned you off.
Spina. That I recall.
I ran the city streets —no matter how:
Shoved like a paper boat upon the stream,
By the same miracle I kept afloat.


Chance brought me here, being shipped from Genoa
To feed a cargo of some hunting birds,
Hawks, kestrels, falconets; a full man by then.
Well nigh eleven summers.
Brocca. This I knew.
Spina.
You knew what no man thought it worth to know!
Do you not jest with credence ?
Brocca. No, my lord.
I knew you came with falconets.
Spina. Years agone.
Brocca.
It was in June and fourteen years have passed.
Spina.
You gaze in crystals then, or read the stars.
Brocca.
Not so: the only wonder to be told
Is in yourself, and you shall answer me
How many toes you count upon a foot;
I say your left hath six, the great being double.
Spina.
And six it had, as Christ was crucified!


Brocca.
Till you wore shoes your footprint showed your
path;
And since, you have not wandered. All could tell
Of ragged Spina.
Spina. True, they called me so,
For like a thorn appeared the tiny claw,
Thrust sideways from my foot; a faulty bark
Still witnesses the surgeon’s pruning hook.
Now mark me, Brocca, in this tiny span
Which we call life, a kind of order reigns,
As ’twere a structure built of separate stones
Depending each on other, and in plus
Conspiring to a single harmony.
And since my head was large enough to hold
The smallest hum among the hurrying hours,
There have been tingles of a song uncaught
But ever circling nearer. I do know
Its key and burden, and my heart can tell
How well this fanfare hits the register.
That you have told me true you need not urge;
From sole to crown I have the proof of it;
And by my soul I’ll live to wear the crown;
And you whom destiny, not love, did drive


To show this knowledge, shall receive reward
As though it had been love.
Brocca. You will bestir?
Spina.
Ere this good duke make shift to poison me?
Nay, master taster, look you well to-that;
Your pay with me ranks higher. For the rest,
Fate shall not call me laggard while I live.
Re-enter Scullions.
ist Scullion.
Master kitchener hath an itch on his temper for his
own reasons ; therefore ware his reach.
3rd Scullion.
Be truth in the old phrase that good soup calls for
sut outside and a mirror in ?
ist Scullion.
Mind how thou speak it here, lad! Speak it not in
reach of master kitchener, nor in my reach neither.
’Tis sluts’ working, though the soup may be the
better for it.


Spina.
We must not seem companions. Try a jibe with
this good fellow, using some battery of big words.
Brocca.
How now, master scullion, have you your minions
in the slick of beatified ablutions ?
ist Scullion.
I would I could say that, sir; they are but poor
ablutions, yet as men they are honest enough, if
putting years on.
3rd Scullion.
Ah ha! I put on nothing, for I take off nothing!
An Almighty God put years on me, no fault of
mine.
Brocca.
Thou art a knave, old scare-fly; prove thou art
not a knave!
jrd Scullion.
I prove nothing; an Ibe what Almighty God made
me, if a knave or no, ’tis none o’ my choosing, so
please you. An you like not me you be best to say
so in your prayers, if so be you do confess o’
Saturdays. Ah ha! Ah ha! [Exit Spina.


Brocca.
Good, sir scare-fly, you are a worthy scullion to a
king.
3rd Scullion.
No, Ibe neither. Ibe scullion to master kitchener.
Brocca.
You eat the King’s money.
3RD Scullion.
Ay, so be; but Ido get it of master kitchener.
Brocca.
You are in the King’s service.
3rd Scullion.
So be, but it be master kitchener can put me out ’n it.
[There is general laughter.
2nd Scullion.
You be of the duke’s men.
3RD Scullion.
You be not a’s jester, that I wurrant. We do have
a jester can lay any man on a’s back. So be you
come from furrin Mantua, I give not a fig for you
as jester.


ist Scullion.
Now lad!
3rd Scullion.
So be you jest with me—
ist Scullion.
Now lad, manners!
3rd Scullion.
Almighty God do know l—
ist Scullion.
Fall to, fall to! Ye have a scurvy manner for a
duke’s man to have in hearing. Fall to!
Enter Master Kitchener, who rings the service
bell. They take up their work.


Scene 2. A rose alley in the palace gardens.
Spina discovered.
Spina.
HOW can I know sjie loves me? Love being
blind
Hath robbed the worldly judgment from mine eyes
And filled them with imagination’s fire,
To make bright pidhires of the intangible.
Thus falling in the dark we see red stars
Flaring like cressets; thus the fumes of wine
Do fill the air with reptiles and strange fiends
Quite unsubstantial to our saner sight;
And thus may one who loves, being all a prey
To inward fevers, see the thing he dreams,
And know not that he dreams the thing he sees.
And thus might I make chap-books in the dusk!
No, no! If Ibe dreaming I’ll so hold
My blissful vision as to take my gain
While it doth stay; and more, if I awake
And still desire it, I will wring the world
Until I twist it to the shape that pleased.
If, beauteous Vaga, I desire thee so


That in my fever I do dream thee mine,
Then will I win thee for my waking self
And in the workshop of our daylight life
Build firmly up my slumber’s ecstasy!
Thou shalt be Spina’s! Thou shalt give thy heart
To this poor jester in his cap and bells.
And in his arms remaining shalt become
His queen for ever with a double crown.
Enter Alfonso.
This is the goshawk loves my lady’s tiring maid.
Alfonso.
What seek you, sirrah, in this rosy spot ?
Spina.
I do indeed seek that of which your presence
hinders me.
Alfonso.
A dainty thing ?
Spina.
A very lovable, whose name is solitude.
Alfonso.
Aw!


Spina.
Haw!
Alfonso.
A foolish jest!
Spina.
Then well chosen.
[Exit Spina in dumb show of disdain.
Returning unobserved from opposite
side he strikes Alfonso with his
bladder , and exit.
Alfonso.
The tadpole! Heigh ho, these love stories are a
perilous thing, and yet inevitable. It is not alone
my rank; she hath affedion for me, won as easily
as hedge fruit. I smile, she smiles; I cap, she
curtsies; I find her beautiful, she adores me; then
a lie or two, and a vow or two, and we are there.
Well, women are a sweet frailty, and frail to be
sweet; and Soon won, soon rid, is an old proverb.
She is beautiful, by consent; loving she is; faithful
Ido believe her; if she have faults they do not
show themselves. 1 could wed a worse, and might
die a celibate ere I find a better; but my rank saith:
c Hold, refled;! Enjoy thyself in the postponement


of decisions. Pluck what is to hand and leave to-
morrow to its own devices! ’ And it is a right
principle. They admire us for it. She comes. Well,
I will be very lovable to-day, and fix a meeting.
Enter King
King.
Sent as to prayer, Alfonso. I had else
Been at the pains to seek a word with you.
Alfonso.
I am, my liege, at your disposal ever.
King.
We thank you. But, beseech you, be at ease;
I talk no state affairs. This musky shade
Invites more fitly to a gentler theme.
Alfonso.
My lord, I know naught of it.
King. Nay, forsooth,
A galliard of your length is still a babe!
How doth your vintage promise ?
Alfonso. Well, my lord:
The present sun will breed a lusty grape
And fill our barrels.


King. And the rother flocks?
Alfonso.
Increase and have good markets.
King. Then your rents
Are firm and unencumbered, as I think ?
Alfonso.
They never were encumbered, grace a Dieu!
King.
The church book gives you thirty years.
Alfonso. My lord ?
King.
A wealthy nobleman of thirty years,
Tall, middling handsome, all the gifts of God,
And yet no wife! You court some ridicule.
Alfonso.
I have it daily from my mother, sir.
King.
Hah, she doth very rightly. You recall
That, some hours since, our council did propose
An early mating of the princess royal,
The gentle lady Vaga, and meseems
F


You did upspeak with something to her praise.
I like you, sir; if you had more affairs
Upon your shoulders I should like you more.
We grow to our occasions, and our strength
Increases with our labour. Think you then
Your metal would be strained if you were prince
And husband to this lady ?
Alfonso. ’Tis a height
I had not look’d to.
King. I have pondered it
And leave it to your answer, yea or nay.
You would be named a governor, and your cares
Would eat the stomach of your idleness;
But for a bridegroom with his cooing done
The secret of best happiness lies in work.
Your heart were free for it?
Alfonso. My heart is free:
My mind disturbed but with this sudden gift;
This joy, I would say.
King. Then refled a while.
Take council with thy mother, and regard
Her worldly wisdom as beyond thine own.
A woman’s judgment is the better half
Of man’s decisions, if he will or no;


So ere thou wed, learn this: Do thou be steel
Against all wifely tears and blandishments;
Hold ‘thus’ and ‘thus,’ and bang thy angry fist—
And thou wilt conquer for her all she wills.
Enter Duke of Mantua.
Duke.
May I be bold to crave a word, your grace ?
King.
As many words, my lord, as may content
The purpose of your asking. ’Tis an hour
Well fitted for kind intercourse, and here
The breeze hath genial tricks that bless the shade.
My lord Alfonso will return anon. [.Exit Alfonso.
Duke. Methinks
I never yet knew sunshine till this hour.
It hath a potency of loveliness
That like a calming physic after pain
Steals subtly through my vitals to my blood,
And thus suffuses every part of me
With roseate exaltation. ’Tis in truth
A banquet for bright gods whose golden bowls
Spill nedar and upheaped ambrosia.


King.
So might the Greeks have sung it, with the throb
Of choric feet on some old mountain side.
Duke.
Yet nothing hath been ever sung or said
Which could unload the breast of what it feels.
King.
1 hold that true. With many thoughts to think
And little time, I have not read the poets.
Meseems I know them by an extra sense;
I do not read them. Yet from sundry snacks
That wing about us I perchance may think
They jingle more with words than with those deep
And innermost mysteries that elude the will
To otherwise express, so that we lose
The utterance which had made us rich indeed.
My daughter hath more knowledge in such things;
I have some skill with roses.
Duke. Sir, I would be brief,
I have in these short hours known such a change
Within my heart I can but speak of it;
And, pray you, hear me, if I love her not,
This beauteous daughter with the magical name,
Then call me stock, and bid my ship unfurl,


And pack me off upon the watery wastes,
Where sirens could not draw me, where the winds
Would find me deaf, the lode-star hide itself,
The hungry rocks themselves make sport of me
As harder than the adamant. My estate,
My quality and condition you do know,
I will be brief, and ask you for your mind.
King.
I fear the lady is but ill-disposed
To my decisions; she hath of her sex
The subtle charm of contrariety.
An you will win her heart I wish you joy
As readily as ever father might,
For from her heart I could not stay her hand;
But should the winning prove a thorny task
I beg you harbour no revenge on me.
Duke.
I ask no greater favour.
King. Nay, ’tis none.
I will but promise that the field be fair.
You saw his Holiness but recently;
Come tell me of him and the world at large;
And I will show you roses with such scent
As robs the memory of Teherahn. \Exeunt.


Enter Alfonso.
Alfonso.
The King did order me to return anon.
I must await him.
Enter Olivia.
Olivia.
Dear heart!
Alfonso. [Aside.] Oh, this is starting out betimes.
It was a lie, and little lies do breed
Like crawfish in a mud-hole.
Olivia. I am come.
Alfonso.
Most foolishly! The king is loose around.
Olivia.
Nay, he hath secrets of his own to keep.
He doth propose to make the Duke his son
By giving him our lady.
Alfonso. There you lie!
Olivia.
My lord, how strange you are! What have 1 said ?
1 overheard it but a moment gone.


Why doth it anger you?
Alfonso. You overheard?
You have been prying on the king’s affairs?
Olivia.
I had no mind to it. I had crept near
Ere I could tell that any was within,
And was afeared to leave them.
Alfonso. So you stood
Among the eaves-drops!
Olivia. Say not so, my lord;
If I have angered you, I pray forgive
What came not by my seeking. Would you had
A thousand heavier sins upon your soul
That I might know the joy to pardon them!
Alfonso.
Sins on my soul ? I am a councillor,
And when the King will talk affairs with me
I will not thus be spied on. Mark you that!
Olivia.
Nor I spy on you.
Alfonso. What you heard in part
I can with less of harm make plain to you,


Since listeners get it edgewise through a crack,
And miss the meaning and make garbled sense
Of what may be most simple. Rightly caught
The King doth urge me to his daughter’s hand
Against all protestations. I, meanwhile,
Lest I should anger him, must make some show
Of kindness to the lady; but fear not;
Be secret as thou wert already dead,
And trust me ever. Canst thou trust me then ?
Olivia.
Dear heart, how foolish seems an impotent word
To one whose heart is breaking-full of love!
I trust thee? Nay, if thou art not myself,
My better, dearer, lovelier self, in all
Save my unworthiness to be a part
Of such a dear perfe&ion, then beware,
I will not trust myself, but cease to live,
Lest thou shouldst weary of my trust in thee!
Alfonso.
Now speaks she like herself! Ah, sweet Olivia!
Olivia.
But when thou frownest I am not myself.
I know not what I am, or where, or why,


Nor would be living; I would rather fall
Right through the earth, and on, and on, and on,
Than I should ever open eyes again
And see thee frowning. Love, my heart will break
So much I love thee! Hast thou not a kiss ?
Alfonso.
This place is perilous with the King abroad!
Olivia.
Then tempt no peril. When I dream at nights
I think me in my grave, and oh ! ’tis sweet
To feel the calmness that I have not known
Since first thy lips did touch me; ’tis a rest
As lulled by tempests on the midnight pane
That beat but cannot rouse us; ’tis a sleep
Of deep oblivion full of morning-scents.
I rather would not wake. I would be dead,
[i She sinks into his arms.
That I might stay and drink, and drink of rest,
And know no more the pitiless, pitiless thirst
That all my body hath to feel thine arms.
[He kisses her.
Take not thy lips away. Nay, let them burn.
My flesh doth love the agony that they make.


Alfonso.
Thou didst not read amiss my politic words;
I owe the King much duty.
Olivia. 1 heard naught
Of any words of thine. It was the duke,
The Duke of Mantua asking of the King
Some favour with the princess.
Alfonso. Heard you that?
What answer had he ?
Olivia. Ay, it was but now.
Do I remember ? Nay, ’twas yesterday;
Or was it now ? I think it was but now.
Alfonso.
What answer made the King ?
Olivia. The King did answer—
If I recall aright—he answered him
That he had leave to woo her, or belike
To win her were she willing. Was it now
He spake ? My mind is clouded. Love!
Alfonso.
Nay, this is hiding what you know full well.
I’ll not be tricked so.


Olivia. How? You break my heart!
Alfonso.
Most surely if you find convenience in’t.
’Twill hot or cold as suits your plan, no more.
I never saw a woman but designs
Of some hid purpose worked in her. Go to!
[He thrusts her from him. and she falls.
Exit Alfonso.
Enter King and Duke of Mantua.
Duke.
How now ? How now ?
King. My daughter’s tiring maid.
How came she in the garden ?
Duke. She hath swooned.
King.
How, what’s afoot? [The Duke raises her.
Olivia. I think, my lord, I swooned.
King.
Why came you here?
Olivia. I had a turning head
And sought the air a moment.


King. Ah, poor girl!
Olivia.
My lord, you are too kind. I am not well.
[i She sinks to the garden bench.
King.
Then we will send assistance. Wait you here.
\Exeunt King and Duke.


Scene 3. Vaga’s tiring room. Olivia is
discovered.
Olivia.
To say I tricked him! That I had designs!
What tricks or what designs were possible
Against the raw wounds of my quivering heart
Where he is guarded. But to think doth wound.
To hear his footstep is a wound as deep
As running poniards through me. Where he is
My heart doth draw me gasping as for death,
That he may slay me!
Enter Vaga.
Yaga. Pray unlace me now;
The time is plenty, but ’tis better used
Upon the finished end. Why, girl, you weep!
Olivia.
Not I, my lady, I have only joy.
Yaga.
The joy of sparrows peeping in the snow:
The voice of usance, but a different key.


Olivia.
No, lady, I am very joyful.
Vaga. Faith,
I rather would be sad! Pray loose my gown.
Why fell you in the garden, sweet Olivia ?
Olivia.
From foolishness, mayhap.
Vaga. Mayhap, mayhap;
Or else mayhap because you ceased to stand.
I marvel at such answers ! Are you sick ?
Olivia.
No, lady, I am well.
Vaga. Yet sick enough.
Would you to bed, and let Fiammetta come?
Olivia.
No, lady, no; I would not have her come.
Believe me I am well, and gay at heart.
[She breaks into tears.
Vaga.
Then God be praised for health and gaiety,
And keep them from me! Faith, your wedding-day
May bring you tears of joy, but on my life


You weep not happily now. Nay, on my life!
Your pretty, bronzed cheeks have lost the sun
And caught the hue of winter, and hard rains
Beat runlet courses down. Oh, I’ll be sworn
This tempest is most bitter in your breast.
Come, let me know. What hath been cause of it ?
Olivia.
There is no cause.
Yaga. Then thou shalt tell his name.
Olivia.
He hath no name.
Yaga. If he hath told you so
He is a villain. He hath certain two,
And likely three, and if he be of rank
He hath from ten to twenty, all of which
He hath dishonoured saying he had none.
The truth being spoke thou hast a pretty face,
And by some error in thy making up
Thou also hast a heart, against all wont,
For which thou must be tortured till the gift
Pay thus its discount to a jealous heaven. [Sighs.
The marble-breasted gods are happiest,
In their calm beauty glowing with desire


And rage and satient hate, but never woe;
Yet they do envy us that flick to life
Which is our human quality; for man
Climbs godlike upward as his heart becomes
Less tender, and at length a heart no more.
I hold it for the very core of truth.
And know, Olivia, since I came of age
To wear a pettikirtle I have shed
No smallest tear, nor had such thought of grief
That I could wish to shed one. Think you not
I have a touch of marble in my frame ?
Say, seems it not ?
Olivia. I beg you pardon me.
1 fear I heard you not. I earn your blame.
Yaga.
All’s one, Ido but say I have no heart,
And therefore need not weep, nor never shall.
But tell me of your own. I ask no names.
Olivia.
Oh, lady! [Weeps.]
Yaga. There, an you will give me tears
In place of words, I cannot learn too much,
’Tis very sure, nor yet enough to help.


Olivia.
No help can come to me.
Yaga. Tush! he’s a man.
The world holds many others.
Olivia. Ay, it doth!
But he is not of them. He is a woe .
Within my breast, at times mine eyes, mine ears—
Or tightly clasping me and kissing hard
Eyes, mouth, cheeks, neck, hair, fingers, every-
thing !
Oh, if you loved, dear lady, ’twere to ache
Till thought did lose all meaning, till a voice
Doth seem a memory from forgotten days!
Yaga.
He clasped you, then ?
Olivia. His arms did burn in me;
When they are flung to take me, then my breath
Stops sudden, and the doorway of my throat
Is blocked with stony walls, and all the cries
That stifle in me die without escape.
Yaga.
And he hath kissed you many times ?
G


Olivia. Alas I
I would that I might hold the count of them;
But raining one on one, they chase the mind
So that she hides with all the hurrying world
And we are left alone.
Vaga. I ask no names,
Nor will I have you darkly hint at them;
1 would not know them. You imagine much.
No man’s two arms could make my senses go.
You should be married with such high respeft
For arms and kisses. Faith, I want them not.
How old are you ?
Olivia.
I shall be two and—
Vaga. Then you are not yet;
Not two and twenty. Yet i’ faith well grown.
Not quite so tall as I, but roundly set,
And giving measure for beyond your years.
[Vaga measures her with a ribband , and
then herself.
Or more or less the same. And you will wed ?
Olivia.
He is a lord at court. [Weeps.


Yaga. Then give thy mind
To find some other plaything. Noble lords
Must not wed humble maidens, be they sweet
As woodland hyacinths or hedgerow may.
There is a virtue in the noble rose
Which hath command of precedent.
Olivia. Alack!
I know, my lady, that it should be so.
Yaga.
Indeed it should, and must.
Olivia. Alack, alack!
Yaga.
Tell this young lording he were best from court
Ere he should ire the King.
Olivia. Alack, alack I
Yaga.
I’ll have no antics here.
Olivia. Alack, alack!
Yaga.
No ballad follies here.
Olivia. Alack, alack!


Vaga.
I marvel that it pleases you to play
A part so graceless and unmaidenly.
Nay, nay, no more ‘ alack ’! Can you not see ?
Doth not your judgment show you ? Are you blind ?
Olivia.
I know that I shall die!
Vaga. Be sure you will,
But not of heart-break for my noble lord.
I would not know his name, but of his looks:
How doth he stand with others ? Is he tall ?
Olivia.
Ay, very tall and straight, and hath a brow
Like none I ever saw.
Vaga. And for his voice ?
Olivia.
Like mellow laughter!
Vaga. Hath he comely hands?
Olivia.
Two miracles of strength with gentleness.
His fingers wondrous as a ring-dove’s neck
Do burn my flesh to fever!


Vaga. Hath he wit ?
Olivia.
The sunniest that I ever knew!
Yaga. His gait?
Olivia.
Like some high stag that doth disdain the ground!
Vaga.
And yet he deigns to court my tiring maid?
Oh, he should claim a temple with ten priests
And fifty vestal virgins. Being so
He should exa& burnt incense and be fed
With prayers and chants and garlands. Such a man
Might write himself Apollo and be done.
But not Sardinia holds him.
Olivia. Mistress! Lady!
Vaga.
Well, speak!
Olivia.
I owe you very much for love;
My duty too, and common kindliness.
Vaga.
I will not speak your lover fair for you.


Olivia.
Nay, if I die, ’tis over. But a word.
I beg your secrecy.
Yaga. Along!
Olivia. The King
Hath chose him for the husband of a lady.
[Weeps.
Yaga.
Then he doth well, for well he always doth.
Olivia.
I pray she spurn him!
Yaga. That she never can:
The King’s wish is commandment.
Olivia. Yet I pray
She may not be commanded.
Yaga. Who were she
To set herself against my father’s word?
Olivia.
If ’twere yourself, you would not?


Vaga. Are you mad?
What mean you, girl? Speak out! Speak out, I
say!
Olivia.
The King would have you wed him.
Vaga. Foolish thing!
Who is this vapouring creature, that doth fill
Thy empty head with such amazing talk?
Who is he? Tell me now! I say, his name!
Olivia.
The lord Alfonso, lady.
Vaga. What, that whiskery prawn!
That long aspargrus stalk! That chattering jay!
That glass of lemon water! Oh, that worm!
That grasshopper! That mottled sugar stick!
That gilded baby-rattle with two bells,
And ‘ Bite Me ’ on the fore-end! God’s my judge,
I’ll have my father clip his puppy ears
For giving thee such bumptious rigmarole!
Olivia.
Oh, mistress! mistress!


Vaga. Oh, thou crack-brained lass!
An I be living by to-morrow’s light
Thou shalt be wed to him for this. That eel!
An he rebel for it I’ll have him jugged
And wedded in a prison. Get thee gone,
My lady duchess; get thee from my sight.
Olivia.
I speak it not to anger, but the King
Makes yet another suitor of this duke
Come late from Mantua. I heard him say:
4 Lay siege and conquer,’ or such meaning words.
Vaga.
You heard?
Olivia. I did o’erhear, without intent.
Vaga.
And you are messenger of this to me!
I like a forfeit or a village prize
At Sunday skittle-bowls! I! Conquer me!
Lay siege and conquer me! Now God’s my judge
I’ll have thee murdered if thou wag of this.
Nay, sweet Olivia, I do love thee. What,
Lay siege to me! That brace of gaping pups!
You say you heard this?


Olivia. Oh alack, alack!
Vaga.
Fool, speak with words of import. Did you hear?
Olivia.
I did, my lady, as I hope to die.
Vaga.
As thou shalt be Alfonso’s wedded wife!
And I shall send the Mantuan toady off—
Pack—paddling back a-briny! Cockatrice!
Ho, an ye blubber there, beware my fingers!
My father told them?
Olivia. By the mass he did!
[Spina is heard in the distance.
Vaga.
What sound is that?
Olivia. It is the jackanapes,
A-luting something.
Vaga. Fluting? ’Tis no flute.
Olivia.
A lute it is.


Yaga. Why then, not luting, dolt,
But playing on the lute, and well enough.
Whom call you jackanapes?
Olivia. The jester, madam.
[Spina is heard singing.
Heigh ho, merry and bright!
That is the woe of the weary wight,
But day follows morn, and then the night,
And a heigh and a ho,
And the pillow may be low,
But the last low pillow is awaiting down below.
Yaga.
A pestilent song for summer afternoons;
It garbles melody and sense alike.
[Spina off.
And a heigh and a ho,
And the pillow may be low
But the last low pillow is awaiting down below.
Yaga.
Go, leave me till I call you!
[Exit Olivia. Yaga is the prey to much distress %


Enter the Abbess with the crown jewels.
Abbess.
The King hath bid me bear you these, and begs
You wear them at the banquet.
Yaga. Then I’ll not.
Now I bethink me I will go to bed
And let those feast who have the appetite.
I do not eat this evening.
Abbess. Why, what ails?
Yaga.
The reason why is that I do not eat!
Go tell my father so, and further say
My tiring maid will wear these traps for me.
She hath my height and general measurement;
She speaks most prettily, and hath a mind
For compliments from men, or such as pass
For men in poor default of better ones.
Say I can sip my broth in more content
With greater solitude. Say what you will,
But say no more to me. Take off those beads.
Such things befit a baby; I am none!


Abbess.
My gentle madam!
Yaga. Gentle? Who? Not I!
lam a tower at siege. My bridge is up.
My oil is heating ready. I am bolts
And catapults and crossbows. So beware!
Olivia’s fort is taken, but in me
Is sterner stuff for battle. Tell them that!
Abbess.
Dear lady, how you rave! ’Tis not yourself!
Yaga.
No, not the self that was. That foolish lord,
That blabbing big Valerio, like a boy
Outgrown his hose and doublet and not yet
Of age sufficient for his father’s jets,
Hath took the liberty, before the King,
To tauntingly declare I am a woman. So!
I see no jest in it. If I am grown,
For sure I am, whate’er I wish to be.
And being so, I will be what I am,
And what God made me, whether foolish lords
Make jest of it or no. I am a woman,
And I will speak my mind and have it too,


And not stand dumbly to a siege of sops,
Before admiring parents. Hear you that?
Go tell that jester that his tune annoys;
And take him this. And yet —no, take it not!
Ido not hear his ditty. Those are pearls.
This were an egg to set my pretty birds.
Oh, that was in my childhood! And the boat
That scampered off a-warp of tunny' fish—
Old age hath logged her. Then good-bye my boat!
Give thou this hook to Spina. Say his jests
Have greatly angered me; I liked them not.
No more, but only that: I send this hook
And did not like his jests. Ah, ’tis a page
That I have closed for ever. ’Tis a garden,
A happy, happy garden, tightly closed
And spoilt for memory by rank growth of weeds.
I would not look on it again. But this
I cannot harm to keep. Nay, give it me;
Toss out those beads and let me lock it safe,
As treasure of past days when I was young.
Is this tale common story? Do they know
The siege is forward? What doth Spina say?
Oh, he shall say indeed, if he but think
I show no fight for it. Nay, put them on;
Up-harness me as ’twere a vintner’s mule,
With rings, and gewgaws, tassels, plates, and studs;


I’ll jingle bells and dangle filigranes;
lam the princess; I will bear myself
As doth become a princess of the blood.
But Vaga hath her heart which none shall own
Save him to whom she freely opens it.
[She sinks weeping to her chair before the
mirror.
CURTAIN


ACT III




ACT III
Scene i. The banquet hall. The feasters are dis-
covered seated. Spina and others are
in attendance.
King.
THERE is a happy spirit on me this evening
which I would see most general,
Duke.
I never had so genial an elation, or such an appetite.
Spina.
Then, sir, you are not in love, most evidently.
Love despises food.
Duke.
Spurned love, perchance.
Spina.
Love doth most know itself when it is spurned.
King.
A song, Spina; come, mark it with a song!
H


Spina.
Faith, sir, I have a kind of royal seriousness upon
me.
King.
To-night be king of mirth, and entertain us!
Spina.
Mark you all, gentles, I am commanded to be king.
Well, I will, believe me. So. I pardon all of you.
I bid you drink. Nay, prithee, honour me.
Duke.
Thou hast a strange name for a jester, lad, a very
ill-found name. Seems it not so, my lord?
Spina.
No, sir, it hath the best of merits : it is expressive
of reality. For I, sir, am a prickly person. An you
touch me you whistle for it; an you grasp me you
suck your fingers. Therefore am I called Spina,
being a thorny jester. For the thorn is the true
point of it. An it have no sting ’tis no jest, but
babbling and quibbling, whereas your true jest hath
ever something to bob clear of, from which it
cometh that humour is the medicine of the world.
Would you try a fall with me ? Come, sir, but mind
your fingers. Are you not from Mantua ?


Duke.
I am.
Spina.
Then are you daft on logic.
Duke.
Ars artium, scientia scientiarum; wherefore that
shows no madness, but some wisdom.
Spina.
Ars asinorum, scientia caecorum; wherefore it
shows some information, and much folly.
Duke.
Logic, sir jester, is no folly.
Spina.
So, sir duke, beaten but not subdued. Well, I
charge nothing for my demonstrations. Is this
thing gold ?
King.
By my troth it is.
Duke.
Ay, man, ’tis gold.
Spina.
Does gold sink in water ?


Duke.
For sure it doth.
Spina.
My major then stands approved of you, namely:
gold sinks in water. My minor stands equally
approved: this is pure gold. Ergo, scientia
caecorum, this sinks in water.
[Putting it into a fountain where it
remains afloat.
Duke.
There is an error of eidolon fori.
Spina.
My own two eyes see better.
Duke.
You should have first inquired in what form the gold
was, and whether by such device as floating—
Spina.
It could be saved from sinking. There thou ’rt flat,
thy logic stultified and all the burden of our truth
or error shoved onto thinking man.
[ There is much laughter _
King.
Well won, my Spina. Take the cup, ’tis yours.


Spina.
I thank your grace. I drink your grace’s health.
And being generous of disposition, I make no toast
to the vanquished on such an easy tumble.
Duke.
Vanquished ? On my life I grant no vidory. I say
the matter lies outside the syllogism. ’Tis an
exterior question.
Spina.
On your life it is, and that’s my argument. But
come again. What life is it you swear by ?
Duke.
My own poor mortal life.
Spina.
How know you you are mortal ?
Duke.
All men are mortal. lam a man. Therefore I am
mortal.
Spina.
And that is a syllogism of your own making.
Duke.
And a rock of verity.


Spina.
Firstly then I deny your major by reason of Enoch
and Elijah. Secondly I deny your minor for that
1 have no proof. Thirdly your conclusion being
thus twice overthrown it falls again by petitio
principii, for if to be a man you must be mortal,
how know you what you are till you be dead ? And
fourthly, the whole structure is either reasoning in
a circle or three attempts at a definition outside
experience; as, Men are those who die—which to
a logician is a rounded truth, but to any bag-man’s
donkey but a laughingstock. For if men are those
who die, then as winter cabbages do die in summer,
all men are winter cabbages. [Laughter. Hush,
gentles, I am king to-night. Stay, that’s metrical.
’Tis the inspiration of my exalted state. And I will
improvise upon it to an ancient Mantuan melody.
[Sings.
Hush, gentles, I am king to-night,
And shall be king hereafter;
Leave logic to the foolish wight,
For truth lies nearest laughter!
Duke.
A most rare jester.


King.
He hath the entry of my library.
Spina.
Where being locked one day by an ill chance
I did spend seven months ere any came to open.
Meanwhile I did subsist on old parchments, which
being mummied I sucked the nourishment and spat
out the remainder. Here, sir, I have all the liberties.
An I choose to begin my duties at four o’ the
morning I may do so. An I choose to wind my
wit till midnight I may do so. All the chamber-
lains will pass me outward, and I may take my seat
before anyone upon the ground. ’Tis a life of
infinite honour; and for esteem—go to, an ye
esteem me not then never look to me for pension!
As to love, 1 may love whom I will and none
regardeth. I may eat my heart and none draw near
to check my appetite. While I live I will be merry
for mine own comfort, and when 1 die I shall be
buried for the comfort of others. Therefore, sir
duke, an thou return to thy little world, thank God
that thou hast seen the happiest of thy fellows.
[Yaga rises in confusion.
Abbess.
It is the heat. Come we into the garden. [ Exeunt .


King.
She is robust of wont. I never knew her thus
affeded.
Dolcibene.
She was so gay a moment back!
Duke. Methinks
She showed some weariness while this jester quipped.
His subjed was ill-chosen; syllogisms
Are no amusement to a lady’s mind.
King.
My daughter hath some skill in such affrays:
She will back-answer him, and many a time
Thereafter spend the night with some great book
That he hath quoted to her.
Her fancy is full deep engrossed in books.
Valerio.
She hath the age at which young ladies faint
And give occasion to their cavaliers.
It doth no harm to any. The young men
Can vie to burn their feathers at her nose,
And if the morrow be a Sabbath day
God’s house is full to see her faint again.


Alfonso.
I noted pallor when she came to meat.
Augusta.
Tut tut! She hath the best of rosy health.
The room is over hot, and she does well
To take the air a moment. In a trice
She will return to join our merriment.
King.
An you were pleased to tell me how she doth
I would be grateful for it.
Augusta. With good will. [Rises.
Alfonso.
And tell the princess till she come again
Our mirth is dead.
Valerio. ’Tis not; we keep our cheer,
Well knowing she is well and will return.
Duke.
Say that this pearl I will dissolve for her
If she will drink it.
Augusta. Nay, I’ll say no word,
But bring her back when she hath mind to come.
[Exit.


King.
Sing to us, Spina!
Spina. Of what shall please your grace ?
King.
Of merriment.
Spina.
Of merriment. One song I once indote—nay, I
did indite it, yet indote it not. It was a very merry
song full of bawdy adjectives, as—what was it I had
in the second line ?
St. Philip was a godly man—
No, it was goodly, a goodly man.
St. Philip was a—
No, it was Sir Philip, and no saint!
Sir Philip was a goodly man—
And it was in the next line that I had my master-
piece. But ’tis gone from me. Yet it was most
delightful in its conception. It was much approved
by such as heard it, old and young alike, and could
set old blood off at a bound like a war horse. It
had the subtlety which in such things is so stimulat-
ing. It was a delicate confection, and withal as
wicked as a stew. And now I mind me how it went.
King.
We must be spared it, Spina!


Spina.
It was a masterpiece.
King.
But let it pass.
Spina.
A gem of dainty bawdiness.
Duke.
Your royal master would not have such songs
Before these gentle ladies.
Enter Abbess.
Abbess. I am come
To tell you that the lady Vaga, sir,
Is well but feareth to return again.
The mess of livers hath made ill accord
With something that came after, and the heat,
Mayhap, hath driven the fumes up to her head.
Yet she is well and doth entreat you all
To toast and join in dance as she were here.
King.
Our toasting ended, let the dance begin,
I have a fiddler here, sir duke, will play
The tread-wheel off a Mantuan spinning gin.


Ho, Grillo, —is he here ?—start up, good Grille.
And let us have the tabour’s rat-a-tat
That keeps the feet in order when the mind
Forgoes her discipline for amorous thoughts.
I like a hearty dance. Come, lead us on.
[Music. They dance.
Abbess.
Your mistress is not well.
Spina.
She hath slipped on something, madonna.
Abbess.
No, she hath not fallen.
Spina.
Fallen? Fie, my lady abbess. Yet she hath slipped
on that which doth cause many falls. For she hath
slipped on womanhood, the which doth fit her like
a glove.
Abbess.
I know not how I should understand you. Yet she
is much angered at some matter relative. Only
hours agone the lord Valerio did most unmannerly
rate her for it as a fault, which hath moved her to a
strange and unmedicable access. I know not rightly


whether it be indignation, for she doth weep too
freely; or if a sorrow for some other cause I know
not. She doth weep, and then sigh, and then clasp
me as she would ask my aid in a great matter, but
in what or for what I can by no means get at. She
hath notwithstanding given me this embassy for
you. \Hands him a letter.
Spina. [Reading.
C I thank you,’ and her seal. Well she doth seal
her thanks. What think you that it is, madonna ?
Abbess.
A fish hook.
Spina.
What can one do with such an engine ?
Abbess.
Why, catch fish, plainly.
Spina.
And if they swallow it not, no crying matter. What
would my lady have me do with this ?
Abbess.
Spina, thou art a lad of singular metal.
Thou hast a manner in thy railleries,
Which tells thee ever greater than thy words:


A hint of seeing all that pyramid
Whose steps most men do count. Now hear me
well:
Thou hast some knowledge in that pate of thine
Which I would pay to have.
[He holds out his hand and receives her
■purse.
Spina.
Knowledge is of us, not in us. An I tell the word-
ing I but shake a seed pod.
Abbess.
I am not pot-shards. I can understand,
Though you should try me to the uttermost,
And so it be with honour hold my tongue.
Thou wilt no less if what I say be new.
The King hath bid Alfonso lay all siege
To catch our lady’s favour. Know you aught
Why she should weep each time she speaks of it ?
Spina.
He hath a crack in his singing which doth shock
her true ear in such music.
Abbess.
You should be plainer for our lady’s sake,
For she doth speak of you in scraps each while


As though you held some secret: 4 Doth he know ? ’
And, 4 What doth Spina say ? ’ and more the like;
And when I name the Duke of Mantua,
Who now doth ply a hot and forcible suit
Emboldened by the King’s encouragement,
She doth seem broken between rage and tears,
And having sent this letter grasps it back,
Then weeps and says: 4 Let be,’ and- 4 Take it him.’
Spina.
This is infection, and the moon being full
Doth draw small troubles to a swollen tide;
Yet at the bottom is a tear or two,
Which I, being pixie to the doors and locks
Through all the palace, can set right betimes
By blowing whispers farther than they mean.
What she would know, that hold I by the wing,
And will release to no one in the world
But her sad self.
Abbess. Alas, you overween ;
You may not come to her; she hath some grudge
Denies my ears to hear her when she speaks
With sobs of you. And yet she hates you not;
Though for your life she would not speak with you.
In sooth she hath despite of all the world,
And would withdraw her to a convent cell


Lest she behold again the light of day.
‘At midnight,’ saith she, ‘let me play the thief.’
‘ I cannot now set eyes on anything
That 1 have known. I die if I go not! ’
Spina.
Then must she go, ’tis plain. At midnight, then ?
Abbess.
Such were but rank unreason, not calm thought!
Spina.
Sweet lady abbess, I have that in mind
Which being uttered to her present self
Will so allay her purpose and her fears
That you shall lead her smiling back to bed.
But this is needful, that with beads and book
She be descending by the western steps
When midnight strikes above. I will be there
As on some other errand, and do swear
That ere the clanging of the city clocks
Has ceased upon new morning, she will stand
Less in a convent than in Paradise.
Abbess.
Most strange it is, and folly it may be,
Yet of two evils ’tis perchance the less.


Spina.
An you should fail me, woe! Sardinia’s lost!
Now move aside : they come, \Exit Abbess.
My lord Alfonso, ’tis a sad mourning this evening 1
Alfonso.
How?
Spina.
Mourn you not that our royal mistress doth toss
upon her pillow?
Alfonso.
You know she doth?
Spina.
In truth, my lord. But had I no better than your
eyes, I should know little. See you not of what
malady she hath sickened?
Alfonso.
I saw nothing.
Spina.
Ah, well! Then her message will not be welcome.
Alfonso.
Hath she sent aught to me? Deliver, man.
i


Spina.
Nay, an you marked it not when she did sigh to
you before the company, you will hear nothing
though I shout it. And ’tis a whispering matter,
that I promise.
Alfonso.
Give it at once! Here, take this for thy labour.
[Gives purse to Spina.
Spina.
Bend near a little. The lady Yaga loves you as a
goat doth artichokes. Wherefore being near to
you at dinner she was nipped with gnawings that
she could not suffer, and fled for safety. But an
thou think of her, though it be with no more than
milk-warmth, meet her this night upon the western
steps.
Alfonso.
Fate keeps me occupied. But I was born on a May-
day and my patron is St. Kiss-i’-the-ring, which
means a life of chasing. So you be jesting with
me—
Spina.
Say but yea, I have the gage for it.


Alfonso.
Why, who would not, for such a gentle lady?
Spina.
Now you are valiant. Would you know this seal
from a saucer? [Gives letter.
Alfonso. [Reading.
4 1 thank thee.’ And ’tis her seal to’t.
Spina.
You are to meet me under Neptune’s trident at
ten paternosters before midnight. An thou fail me
thou art a cuckold. But some approach. Withdraw!
Spina.
How doth my noble lord of Mantua?
Duke.
I mark you not.
Spina.
The lady Yaga hath marked me, that I warrant. I
shall go sore a fortnight for it.
Duke.
For once thou hast been deserving!


Spina.
Yet my stripes came for good argument against
your lordship. She will hear nothing against you.
Duke.
So?
Spina.
Nay, rather reap the ripe advantage of it. I am a
trusted servant here, sir. Do you catch my mean-
ing? Saw you not how my lady rose from dinner
with her eyes to the garden?
Duke.
No, and what of it?
Spina.
Then I have no credit with you. An you saw not
that, you will not see my honesty. Yet I am
provided with her gage.
Duke.
Unfold, man; what’s the point of it ?
Spina.
Spake she to you of fishing?
Duke.
True, she did.


Spina.
Do maidens fish in Mantua?
Duke.
At times, for husbands.
Spina.
Home at a bound, sir. Here in Sardinia men have
none of your fine wit. I mope and pine for a
glimpse of perspicacity. This, my lord, the princess
hath secretly directed to you, and what it saith not
needs no breath of mine.
Duke.
A fish hook?
Spina.
Here as in Mantua! And I have read that it was
the same with the ancient Greeks. Love’s language
changes not. But an thou pipe a word on me, I
shall be hanged for it ere daylight. I prithee, sir,
as I have deserved of my mistress, make me feel
deserving of your lordship. [Duke gives his purse.]
’Tis no price for a rope collar, but I work for love;
for know that I do in secret adore my mistress with
a dog’s devotion. Therefore I tell you that she is
in extremity with fears of one lord Alfonso, a
foolish lord who is nigh to wedding her. And she


would speak with you thereupon, and so be she
might be found with you she would draw a long
sigh of rejoicing for that the king her father could
not otherwise than bless your union in such a case.
Therefore an you love her, or could love her, or
in default could find a grain of Christian pity, or
in default a touch of knightly honour and chivalrous
duty, I do implore you to join her upon the
western steps at midnight, and to that end await
me at the fountain of the Three Graces some ten
paternosters earlier. An you consent, here is her
pledge. [ The Duke takes the fish hook .] Cum tacet
nox, eh? But soft, the king is witness how we plot.
Rebuff and leave me.
\The Duke snaps his fingers in Spina’s
face and retires laughing.
King.
Why, Spina, you make no sport for us!
Spina.
I am the sport of others, sir. While 1 am waiting
for a word of duty with your grace, up comes one
Jack after another to claim good manners from me.
An 1 cannot perform my duty with my King 1
will leave your service, though God knows I should
starve elsewhere, being a poor hand at begging.


King.
What duty canst thou have?
Spina.
My lord, you love your daughter.
King.
She is amiss?
Spina.
I think she be. But you may miss her to another
tune.
King.
’Fore God, speak out!
Spina.
Ido entreat your grace to silence. I lose my life
by it. To-morrow morn will see no jester. And
yet, sir, if you will hearken to me I hold the matter
in the hollow of my hand.
King.
On, man alive; be brief.
Spina.
My liege, the lady Yaga hath a plan to reach this
night —


King.
No: from his mouth that saith it I will draw—But
on, finish!
Spina.
And see my tongue in a pincers? I have said
nothing. There’s an end.
King.
Not while you live and I have aught to learn.
Spina.
You wrong her, sir. You wrong yourself. As for
me I have but one life to lose; and that is done,
praise God! To be short, the lady Yaga is like to
put you to some shame, for that you have against
her will besieged her with two worthless suitors.
In what they are unworthy, trust me to draw from
their own confessions in your presence. I have
the whole matter, sir. But look to your daughter
if you would keep her in the nest after it. She
hath even now a hankering for the wing. Saw you
not when she did rise from dinner? Was it for
nothing that she did wave her hand?
King.
I saw it not.


Spina.
Ah well. Then you have no wish to see further of
it.
King.
On your duty, Spina, tell me everything.
Spina.
Fear not, sir, I seek naught but duty; it hath a
filling effeft upon the stomach and will work
miracles in paying for a mass.
King.
This for good aid. [Giving purse,] Now out with
it!
Spina.
The lady Vaga, my lord, is with the distress of her
discoveries so overcome, that she hath jumped
some pivot in her brain, and while you danced so
happily, did send the lady abbess to require my
attendance of me, saying that I must hold her book
as acolyte while she did adore the moon. An you
doubt it, sir, you shall see the proof thereof upon
the western steps at midnight. Be therefore in
your new rose arbour at some ten paternosters
sooner.


King.
Thou shalt have better earnings by this pass.
Spina.
I am assured of it. But we are noted. Command
me, sir, to sing, and leave me lightly.
King.
Sing, man, sing!
Spina.
Ay, an it please you.
Oh gentles, I am King to-night,
And shall be King hereafter;
Leave logic to the foolish wight,
For truth lies nearest laughter.


Scene 2. A corridor in the ■palace. There are sounds
of disorderly music and much festivity.
Enter Alfonso and Augusta.
Alfonso.
TEE rumpily rumpily ree ;
Tee rumpily rumpily ree!
I have never had such music nor such dancing;
and thou, madonna, art the merriest of partners,
though the world were put through a catch-comb.
Augusta.
I like a frolic dance. It doth the blood good.
Alfonso.
Ay, so it doth, so it doth!
Augusta.
Ay, so it doth, so it doth!
Alfonso.
Oh, what a night of holiday! And madonna
Faustina hath her flags hoisted to entertain the


King; and he will little of her. I pinched her arm
and told her so.
Augusta.
An thou shouldst pinch mine thou wouldst smart
for it. I should smack like the fat-legged girl at a
party. I should be a flaming tigress. [Alfonso
pinches her .] Out! Lord Alfonso! A pretty record
I shall bear by daylight. I shall be black and blue
for it, and green the day after; and I shall have a
yellow tarnish patch for a month to show my
husband.
Alfonso.
Poor, poor madonna! An he cure it not with kiss-
ing, come to me. A kiss hath a marvellous magic
beyond pharmacopies! [He kisses her arm .] Now
let Egidio find us!
Augusta.
I care not. He may amuse himself, so pleasing.
Alfonso.
A good wit. A good wit. I sign my name to it,
despite my dukedom. It doth brace a man. Ay, so
it doth, so it doth! [Kisses her.


Enter Dolcibene.
[.Exeunt Alfonso and Augusta.
Dolcibene.
I have sought her in twenty corners for a merry
word or two to cheer my widowhood. \Exit.
Enter Egidio and Abbess.
Egidio.
You shall not miss all the skipping. I will have
the fiddlers scrape up pump-a-poodle. Even your
abbess cannot baulk at that. An a man drink till
he has three legs he cannot fail to gauge a pump-a-
poodle. So!
Pump-a-poodle
Pump-a-poodle—
Oh I can do it divinely when I can do naught else.
It is the king of dances for a tardy hour.
Abbess.
But my frock forbids it.
Egidio.
Then take it off. Your true gentlewoman is herself
in anything. Hah hah ! I am a married man.


Abbess.
’Tis well your wife hears you not.
Egidio.
Hah hah! Good soul, she is a school-teacher for
exactness. But we are out of bounds here. An the
abbess will not dance a pump-a-poodle, here’s a
kiss for the lady Ersilia. [Kisses her.
Re-enter Alfonso and Augusta.
Augusta.
My husband with the abbess. Oh, thou faithless
man! Thou roystering libertine! Hast thou no
respect for the King’s palace ?
Egidio.
I did nothing! Shall I not take air with an abbess
in a cloister but thou wilt think harm of it ?
Augusta.
My lady abbess, you shall tell me true: did this
toad kiss you?
Abbess,
Fie, my lady!
Augusta.
I ask you: did he touch you with his chin!


Abbess.
Oh fie, I did feel nothing!
Augusta.
Had you said true, I might have chafed at it, but
now—Ah well, I have a faithless husband and the
King may learn what he will!
Enter Dolcibene.
Dolcibene.
How now! How now!
Augusta.
This libertine is whittling horns to fit me. Nothing
worse. If I could but shield his children from the
knowledge I were happier. He shall have debts for
it, and of my making, I promise.
Dolcibene.
And lord Alfonso cannot even it ?
Augusta.
How mean you ?
Dolcibene.
Saw I not but now ?


Alfonso.
Are you mad, sir?
Dolcibene.
No, sir, nor blind, sir, nor an old fool, sir, nor a
young fool either, for that matter. I take no harm
by your prankings, any of you, but I will not stand
by and hear an honest man’s reputation slandered
by a faithless wife. I saw her doings with you.
Egidio.
Prankings? Doings? Faithless wife? In publicity!
Not even retired! Oh I scent well enough the trail
in it. I’ll to the King!
Dolcibene.
Had my wife tricked me—
Augusta.
Your wife, you bat! Why, it was her perennial
sport. The town rocked at it. Sardinia made its
proverbs on it. The whole world used it to tickle
merriment with, till it became the anchovy of every
feast.
Dolcibene. \To Egidio.]
Can you not tie the hussy’s tongue?


Egidio.
Sir! She speaks what all can swear to!
Dolcibene.
What?
Augusta.
He would outvent his pique on you, Egidio.
Egidio.
Nay, he shall not!
Augusta.
We want not his interference. What care I how
you jested with the abbess! I detest gimlet peepers.
Abbess.
There is much harm bred by it, blowing a ha’porth
of soap to an acre of bubbles!
Dolcibene.
You are not in your convent, lady abbess.
Abbess.
My duties lie not there. Some pray; some work.
I rather would have sweet humanity
With toil and laughter than a long-nosed saint.
[,Exeunt Egidio and Augusta one way y
Alfonso the other.
K


An you would be a saint, sir Dolcibene,
I will not join you; get you to your cell.
For jollity doth add a salt to life
That pricks the appetite for homely fare,
Whence springs contentment, and the praise of God.
Dolcibene.
I do entreat you!
Abbess. You have angered me!
Dolcibene.
I would not do so for a harp in heaven.
I that am lonely in my widowhood
Displease so dear a lady! Woe the day!
But I entreat you. Nay, I do implore you.
I will be merry as a Jack ashore
If you will hear me. I entreat of you.
[Exit Abbess followed hy Dolcibene.


Scene 3. The garden by the western steps of the
palace.
Enter Spina looking about him.
Spina.
NOW do I come to the last chapter, the final
hem before the peroration; then, Here endeth
the life of a happy jester. I have jested immoder-
ately; I have laughed away the husk of falsehood;
I have wedded healthy truths for the propagation
of their like; I have learned mankind and woman-
kind both kind and unkind; I have seen the open-
ing of a maiden’s heart, and mine the sun it turns
to; and I have felt mine own heart burst into a
fire, and hers the world that it would shine upon.
Oh, what is left to me? To the jester nothing! He
is at the end of it. He hath run the gamut of all
but the screech notes; and no thirst for fiddling
on old tunes. Some things wear out for us. There
is an effort of quick mastery about jesting, which
an it were my bread-lot I might reduce geometri-
cally and live on as craftsman; but I choose it not;


I have grown through it, like a rhubarb stalk
through the end of a mush barrel. And so, good-
bye, sir Spina. The memory of thee shall make
me merry when thy merrymaking is all done. And
there is in my veins a certain wiggle of something:
my inheritance from a fighting monarch. It hath
always kept my chin up, and will lead me to a
funeral posture worthy of my place among my
ancestors. Being the true king I will reign. An I
die for it, an I pull the plug out of everything, I
will reign while I can keep my feet down, and then
no matter. We cannot choose our destiny, but we
can fulfil it with a stout heart. Mark well, for it
is a king that speaketh; that utterance is worth
gold. To-morrow every word will be a proverb,
for all the importance of this world is personal.
And I being born in this world will carry out its
purposes. I’ll not put Jacks in doublets, or turn
dull scholards into governors. And for a general
mixing up at level, I would not have it, not to save
my head. The width of possibilities is unsettling.
Better slit a sow’s nose than let it tear its palings.
If I have learned aught by jesting, it is this, that
there is fitness, that all things have their character
and their office; and therefore until the world
changes I will rule it as it is. And Yaga? There


lies my rest! I have not worked it out upon the
high seas, but in harbour I shall have time enough.
She will teach me to pray and what not, and if my
heart escape bursting, it will be happy. That is the
riddle of our mortality. But hush! there is game
in the woods. Now for the last ad; now for the
grand finale with the tag and curtain and the rum-
ti-tum. It is Alfonso down by father Neptune: a
bad patron, for he doth stand for brine. I had
half feared for thee, Alfonso, that thou hadst
slipped this charming opportunity of floundering
in a moat, for good wine mounts craftily, but thy
evil star hath kept thee to thy appointment. Now
shalt thou learn the difference between a succulent
egg and a sucked shell, between the passage-way
to a lady’s chamber and a covered moat which is a
water-drain. But wait my moment. And that is
the stealthy tip-a-toe of my lord duke, the admirable
compliment-maker! Thou that wouldst fawn upon
a princess to her wooing, thou bearded billy-goat!
Thou shalt feel thy horns in the mud! Thus shall
I revenge me on a pair of unworthy market-
wedders. Of thy most sweet and delicate villainy
towards me I take no more account. ’Tis of the
times for a prince to be a little secret. But to it.
Now to my apotheosis. In a moment I shall be no


more, and King Vittorio standing in my shoes. Let
my last jest be worthy of my kingship. [.Approaches
Duke.] How now, my lord, are you there?
Duke.
Attentive.
Spina.
And you have the gage in readiness?
Duke.
What gage is that?
Spina.
Gave I not a pretty and fantastic hook, a dainty
pledge of favour from my lady the princess?
Duke.
F faith, you gave me a fish hook, so you did. Doth
it import anything to have it about me?
Spina.
Said I not it was her gage? Are you coming privily
to speech and I know not what else with a royal
lady, and you omit to bring the password? If 1
should fall a-wooing, sir, —But there, if she rate
thee, blame not me for it, if she open not to thee,
do not diminish my reward on that account. I


shall continue to serve you. And yet, sir, be very
circumspicious in this matter. The King doth
already know of it.
Duke.
’S blood!
Spina.
Oh, have no fear for small inconveniences, I hold
all information. There is no impediment. While
the King awaits you both in a quiet arbour, I lead
you quietly to the lady’s presence by a secret
entry.
Duke.
I am afeared to do it.
Spina.
Afeared, sir? I marvel at such a word from you!
I have read of gallantries in Mantua which were
heroic beside our little passatempo. We have no
such hilarities in our quiet island; and yet we will
do what we can. ’Tis a diversion for a summer
evening. The lady—but of that I say nothing.
You enter by a passage underground.
Duke.
If the King learn it?


Spina.
To-morrow no poor Spina!
Duke.
I should be murdered by his bravos.
Spina.
And what of it? Think you I mind that beside the
peril of mine own head? Be of a light and merry
heart, sir!
Duke.
I would be quit of it ere plunging!
Spina.
Well, an you will chance the spies around the
garden, make a bolt. And yet I hold it safer to go
on. I see no other way out with a whole skin.
There is no other safety in my devising.
Duke.
Madonna!
Spina.
Hist! lie down, and move not. I will return.
[Goes over to Alfonso.] One man in the elysium
of his conscience; now for another! You are come,
my lord ?


Alfonso.
I’ faith I am come, and with no small peril of being
nabbed for a prowler. There was a tread behind me
for some forty paces ere 1 eluded him.
Spina.
My lord, the King doth know everything. He hath
surrounded the whole garden and doth send his
halberdiers across it checkerboard. An thou be
found in a checker, there is twelve inches of good
halberd spike for thy doublet, fore and aft. A pain-
less death, I take it.
Alfonso.
The Virgin! I were best up a tree and that quickly !
Spina.
Not with this moon to throw a shadow!
Alfonso.
Then how, o’ devil’s name!
Spina.
You have my lady’s pledge, plainly.
Alfonso.
The writing ?


Spina.
Ay, the letter, with the seal.
Alfonso.
In the lining o’ my bonnet. ’Tis with my cloak
and sword, with my servant that doth await me
outside.
Spina.
Then say acceptable prayers !
Alfonso.
If I run for it ?
Spina.
Why, then thou’lt get it! Make no mistake about
the King’s mind towards you.
Alfonso.
’S blood ! I am trapped !
Spina.
Be of a light heart, sir. I am a person of resources.
An we be caught together we shall be spitted
together! Doth it not seem a romantic hearth-story,
the jester and the lord Alfonso with their bones
rattling in the same basket ?


Alfonso.
An I be ta’en I’ll throttle thee!
Spina.
Hush, hush, my lord, let us not waste our precious
moments in unseemly wrangling. An thou be ta’en
thou’lt learn it first in heaven. ’Tis the easiest and
the rapidest death imaginable to be spitted by a
halberd. But so I manage to take thee by a secret
way, reward me accordingly. Hist! down, lie flat!
Make neither sound nor movement till I return.
If any find thee, feign an innocent slumber, [He
goes towards summer house.'] Another soul in bliss.
Well, ’tis a kind of medicine of which they will
have much profit; meanwhile they shall take it in
suitable abundance and lick the spoon. After that
I will o’ersmile severity and leave the purge to
work its own devices. Is any one within ?
King.
Ay, your master.
Spina.
A clear eye is a sufficiency for these spectacles.
Have you seen aught ?
King.
I saw you cross the pathway and return


Spina.
Then, sir, you have not seen my worms. Hither, I
beg. See you not a long lump of flotsam yonder to
the starboard of Captain Neptune? [He takes up the
King s cloak and cap privily. ] That is the carcase
of Alfonso, suitor for the hand of our most rare
and noble and high-gifted princess, the lady Vaga,
and himself somewhat married to one of her attend-
ants, the pretty and confiding and much wronged
Olivia.
King.
Or he or you will have a fill of penalties to pay,
and I will be persuaded of it.
Spina.
Hush! my noble liege! He is here to anticipate
you in his punishment and to make confession.
But if you follow me: gently 1 see you aught near
the Three Graces, liked a boiled sausage emptied
out upon the gravel with an east and west direction ?
That is my lord’s guest, the Duke of Mantua, of
the Golden Fleece and such like. He hath been
accepted by you as a hot suitor for the hand of
your flower-like and loving daughter, that delicate
rarity, whose hand without her heart had been but
murder. Yet she is safe! He quits us still more


suddenly than he came. For I have proof he was
not driven by stray winds, but of a purpose to annex
this flower and with her all our kingdom. He hath
a secret underneath his shirt, which like a soldier’s
wine-sack being burst doth spoil his frontward.
Therefore his glance avoids us. His marauding is
ungainsayable.
King.
Is this a fat Shrove Tuesday ? By my troth, nay,
’tis on in summer; then ’tis a touch of madness;
or I shall choke awake with a snore; or ’tis the
wine. Answer, boy!
Spina.
Signor ?
King.
By the mass, there is a topsy-turviness somewhere !
lam answered: ‘ Signor ’!
Spina.
For the proof of accurate temporal existence shake
that leg of yours which correspondeth to the other.
An it woggle, it is itself; an its correspondent
woggleth in the place thereof then thou art in a
deep sleep lying the opposite way over.


King.
’Tis not sleep; I came crunching on the footpath;
and there is no likeness to wine fumes. ’Tis mad-
ness or ’tis poison.
Spina.
Poor uncle! \He dons the cap and cloaks]
King.
Uncle? I am uncle to no mother’s son or daughter,
born or unborn! I was never so named in my follies.
’Tis no custom of my people so to speak of me.
Was not my jester with me? Who are you, sir?
Spina.
My name is Vittorio, dear uncle.
King.
Ugh ! this is beyond me! [Turning.
Spina.
Nay, you shall not go, uncle; I command you!
King. \_Rubbing his eyes.']
The apothecary is my first visitor in the morning.
I like it very little.
Spina.
Feel you a peeking at the knees ? It is a sign of


recovery with due precaution, but lie still and move
them not.
King,
A peeking ? I never heard of such! And yet me-
seems there is a strangeness of a sort. Above all —
Spina.
Above all things strive not to wrest free from
slumber, for it is the medicine of a fevered imagi-
nation. Till visions die remain as thou wast dead.
Thou wilt never be thyself again. But in this world
which of us can take his old self on into the morrow ?
Therefore lie calmly! [He goes to the Duke leaving
King standing.'] Heard you aught, my lord?
Duke.
I heard an argument of voices.
Spina.
The cats will argue for my scraps to-morrow. But
if I can save any skin alive it will be yours. I have
said you are the old French rose gardener on the
prowl for snails. Therefore when 1 ask a question
of thee answer me in French; and seeing he is a
Jew of Burgundy, let it be as near to Jewish
Burgundian as thou canst come by.


Duke.
A dialed;. I never heard it!
Spina.
Nor I; but try a little, and keep moving forward in
this runnel way beside the path until thou come
yonder. I have bribed a Barbary guard with fifty
ducats to keep clear of us. Now to convince him:
De quelle couleur est voster rose? Reply calmly:
Rousse comme unjeune tomate.
Duke.
Rousse comme un jeune tomate.
Spina.
Good! Proceed onward; I will return.
[Spina crosses to Alfonso.
King.
£ Rousse comme un jeune tomate! ’ I will lie still.
Spina.
My lord! One of the King’s spies hath seen you,
but being a simple old Frenchman I have stilled
him for the instant declaring you to be a drunken
Barbary guard. Therefore to save our two poor
lives pretend a little. When I ask a question do


thou reply to me in the Barbary tongue. What,
are you sleeping? Answer gruffly: Macka-acky-
hacka.
Alfonso.
Macka-acky-hacka.
Spina.
Now crawl low, proceeding on thy best behaviour
along the runnel way. . [Spina crosses to Duke.
King.
‘What, are you sleeping? Macka-acky-backaT
God grant that I be sleeping! If not, God save
me! My legs grow rigid. There is a coldness in
my feet. I feel what may be peeking.
Spina.
Quickly, my lord, for we are in calamity. Thou
art lost as a gardener. Thy rose being red as a young
tomato hath betrayed us both. Thou shouldst
have given attention to it. Are not the young of
the tomato green? Now up and speed. Follow
this runnel way to the flagstones where thou wilt
find a ring. Lift up; leap in; and turning sharply
to the left follow thy way underground to our
lady’s presence. [Exit Duke as directed. Spina
crosses to Alfonso.] Now command thy best
courage, sir, or we are dead and buried. That
L


rascal Frenchman hath been long in Barbary and
will have none of thy Barbarian. He hath gone to
call the watch. Up; run; seize the flagstone
yonder by its ring and hide thyself magically in
the passage under it; then turning to the right
hand slip rapidly into the presence of our lady.
[Alfonso enters the moat. Spina goes towards
King.] Now, when one shall meet the other in
his flounderings, there will some ornaments come
loose. What is left of them shall be shamed. As
for my uncle, he hath the germs in him of sufficient
suffering. Having but one daughter, he cannot
repeat his sin upon her. I will release him.
Uncle!
King.
May I answer through this nightmare?
Spina.
You shall. Those two bright heroes that did
scuttle off
Were by thy bidding turned to pestering flies
About the sweetness of thy gentle daughter.
The one, Alfonso, with his vows worn out
By all too frequent usage, would have sold
Our cousin’s waiting woman for a price,
And passed as spotless bridegroom, to her woe;


The other, as befits the memory
Of his ignoble tree, hath laid a plot
To take this island captive, being primed
With such a secret as thy wildest thoughts
Had never jumped to; which, to make a phrase
Of what hereafter must be told in full,
Is shortly that thy brother’s son when ta’en
By treacherous Milan was not left to die
Till he had wed within his prison walls
The beauteous daughter of a German knight
Who there was prisoner, and of this bed
A son was early born who being thrust
By halting friends upon the pitiless world
Did by the strange condition of his fate
Regain Sardinia and become a slave
In his own rightful palace. Growing up
His tickling spirit raised him to the place
Of jester to his uncle, King Emanuel;
Each not more ignorant of the inward truth
Than was the other. Then, as ’twere she woke,
Dame Destiny doth send a little word,
To this glib Duke of Mantua, who straight
Bethinks him of the chance within his grasp,
Sets sail, lays siege, and almost wins his prize,
But that his confidant gives all away
To win a higher recompense of me.


The summing of it is that I am son
Of him whose death did make my uncle king,
Of which good knowledge I have been assured
A full day by this clock. Yet having that
Within my heart which claimed a free reply,
I did restrain the ardour of my tongue
Till she had answered what I could not speak,
And here I purpose in your wondering sight
To take her in my arms and claim her mine.
[The clock strikes. Yaga emerges accom-
panied by the Abbess. Spina rushes
to her.
Yaga! My love! [She falls into his arms.
My bride! My Paradise!
King.
Ho! Men at arms!
Enter the guard. Spina replaces royal cap
above his bells.
Spina. Well answered, all of you!
You, sergeant, bend and raise the stony lid
On which you stand.
[He raises the stone midway between those
by which Alfonso and the Duke
have previously entered.


Take up those dabbled men!
[ The Duke of Mantua and Alfonso are
drawn up.
Alfonso, you are free; and freer still
Are you, sir Duke, if you will now confess
My father had a son who in his rights
Is King Vittorio, sovereign of this isle.
Duke.
I do confess it, as I seek for pardon
From outraged heaven and you, for you are he.
King.
Oh, daughter, do you swoon?
Spina. Nay, by her clasp
I am made proud to give reply for her.
She whom I love, as doth the sun the dew,
Hath like the dew given all her sweetness up,
And left the shadows of her former world
Far, far forgotten; and this fiery prize,
This blissful transmutation of herself
To golden rhapsody she shall drink deep,
That the one recompense of human woes
Shall never, never fail her memory.
King.
If I do wake, I cry my heart’s Amen,


And render thanks that in my failing years
I have the freedom of a leisured peace
To see my brother’s rightful line restored,
Sardinia’s throne made strong, and her I love
Thrice happy with the husband of her choice,
His queen, his wife, his all in everything.
