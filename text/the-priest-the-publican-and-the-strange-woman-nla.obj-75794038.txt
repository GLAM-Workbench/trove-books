SOME OBSERVATIONS ON MELBOURNE
AND ITS MORALS.
To those who have the moral welfare of this Colony at heart
there are several subjects which present themselves for
serious consideration, and not consideration only, but action,
immediate and vigorous. When we sit, and calmly contem-
plate?if it is possible calmly to do so?the amount of vice
existing in Melbourne at the present time we are inclined to
lift our voice and cry Shame upon our Legislature , that they
allow institutions that foster vice to endure. Shame upon
those high in the social scale , who luxuriously roll to church in
their carriages, drawn by sleek and fat horses; and who, with
the means and opportunity of doing a vast amount of good,
yet content themselves with a weekly, monthly, or yearly
contribution to our benevolent institutions; and then, with a
self-satisfied air, languidly fall back in their cushioned chair,
imagining they have done their duty. Shame upon those
Professors of Christianity , whose only acts in connection with
which are, a regular attendance at church and prayer-
meetings, and taking part in the business affairs of the
Church ; after having done which, they nominate themselves
elect for Heaven. And a double and lasting shame upon
those ministers of the gospel, who dedicate their services to
God, in name only; who, in dressing-gown and slippers, after
their morning studies, receive visitors, attend to their bit of
garden, perhaps attend an evening devotional service at their
church or chapel once a week, and then consider their


obligations over. We do not include, in one fell swoop, the
members of the Legislature, the upper ten thousand, and the
ministry, for there is an exception to every rule; but un-
fortunately it is a fact?a melancholy truth ?that the
exceptions in the cases named are very few. We have good
men i&our Government, Christian men, in all senses of the
word, in private society, and great, good, and blessed
apostles in our ministry ; but how few, in comparison with
the numbers who fill the different ranks. Large sums of
money are expended yearly in support of missionaries to the
heathen; but how many missionaries have we in our own
city to reclaim and convert our drunkards, our prostitutes,
our pleasure-seekers, and sabbath desecrators. Where are
the missionaries devoted to the service of leading these to
know the Saviour, and making them good members of
society, and fit for companionship with our heavenly Father.
Oh ! they are very few. To do this, it requires a Christian;
not a mere church-goer and professor, but such a man as
the blessed Jesus himself would choose as his associate ; one
without that disgraceful pride which is such a common
element in the heart of man, and which is such a shame?
such a curse ?aye, we may say curse, for anything that tends
to trample on good thoughts?on the better part of nature?
deserves the appellation. With the grandeur of Christ?s
character, the pure lives of the Apostles, the bravery and
disinterestedness of the Martyrs, handed down to us as
examples, is it not distressing that still, vice, with all its
horrid appurtenances reigns triumphant throughout the
world? Everything has its origin, and, therefore, as a matter
of course, this state of things must have its cause. Who
are principally to blame ? It is a question demanding grave
deliberation; but we have no fear, not the slightest hesitation
in answering ? To a great extent, the Legislature !?yes, the
Legislature ?as having the power to make laws, as having


the power to enact regulations for trade, and in fact every-
thing for the proper ruling of a country.? But, as our
remarks on this subject would occupy too much space, were
we to speak of the different parts of the world, we will con-
fine ourselves to the colony we live in?Victoria. Again,
as all the vices of which mankind is guilty,' appear more in
the city than anywhere else, our comments shall be on what
is to be observed in the far-famed City of Melbourne.
? The City of the Southern Hemisphere,? as it is called,
with all its fine streets, its splendid buildings, its handsome
churches, its promenades, its benevolent institutions, which
all tend to make a place beautiful, is still a pandemonium?
a hot-bed of vice. To ascertain the truth of this observation,
the reader has only to walk through the principal thorough-
fares at night-time with his eyes open. It is seven o?clock :
from the tower of one of the churches the bells ring out their
silver tones, calling to worship, now and then answered by a
solitary individual passing through the gates and entering the
porch. The bells stop: let us enter, softly, reverentially;
what do we see ? only fifty persons. Let us count again?
only fifty ? aye, we are not mistaken, that is the number?
room enough for several hundreds, and only fifty take the
opportunity of making their peace with God. The scene is
changed, and we are in Great Bourke Street; in the place
of quiet, all is noise and bustle. Cab after cab, and carriage
after carriage rolls by, causing one ceaseless noise, while the
shouting of cabmen and itenerent vendors of different articles,
? Collingwood??wood??wood;? ?Pies all hot?red hot;?
? Oysters ho !? ? Leader and Australasian ;? ? The Mel-
bourne Punch;? ?Here you are, sir, try your weight for
three-pence;? ? Have a look at Jupiter, sir, the finest sight
to be seen sir, in the world, only three-pence;? ? Are your
nerves bad, gents., one try at the galvanic battery is a sure
cure?recommended by the faculty?just one try, gents., and


you?ll feel the benefit immediately?a panacea for every
disease, for the small charge of two-pence.? The grinding
of hurdy-gurdies, the music (?) proceeding from various
bands of minstrels, the ? move on ? of the policeman, as
some drunkard causes an obstruction to the free movements
of the passers by. All this to a casual observer is some-
thing very inspiriting, but to the thinker what feelings are
aroused ! The volatile, gay, lively, unthinking world, with
all its pleasures, leading to the grave; and, lastly, to Eternity
?that mysterious condition which is the future lot of all.
We have stated our belief, that the Legislature is
primarily to blame; perhaps that expression is rather too
strong, as of course, one body is not fully responsible for the
acts of another; but we maintain, that to a great extent, the
Legislature is answerable for the acts of the people. An
individual guilty of some particular kind of vice, is in reality
primarily responsible, but when the rulers know the existence
of this vice, do they not by neglecting to apply proper laws?
become in reality participators ? If they know the present
statute relating to public houses, leads to the opening of
places, which in their very numbers, are incentives to
drunkenness, are they not to blame ? Again, are they not
deserving of censure, in allowing to exist those great curses
to society, the dancing halls and concert rooms, where
depravity of the lowest and most foul description is to be
seen openly. No attempt is made to hide it, scenes are
enacted which would make the heart of a savage sick, were
he a witness; and yet civilized people, as they are called, go to
these places, and revel in dissipation, and the gratification
of their sensual passions. Turn we to those parts of the
city, in which predominate those places commonly denom-
inated ? houses of ill fame.? At every step are to be met
\
harlots and whoremongers, drunkards, thieves, men and
women originally created in the image of God, debased to


a position lower than that of the beasts. Glaringly, openly,
are these places to be seen, and known even by the youth,
who first steps aside from the path of virtue. They are not
to be mistaken, and yet no notice is taken of them; day after
day they have increased, and their numbers now are terrible.
If there is no Law with regard to these places, then is our
Legislature certainly to blame ; and if there is a proper Law,
still are they guilty of a wrong in neglecting to see it
properly applied. Numberless other forms of vice which
are permitted to be in the city, might be mentioned; but
we will only speak of a few of the most prominent phases of
life in Melbourne, contrasting the good with the bad, and
suggesting remedies, which even if they do not prove such,
may perhaps turn the attention of some of our philanthro-
phists to the matter, and so lead to beneficial results, which
afterwards may be applied to the other great cities of the
world. First, let us glance at the
CONCERT HALLS.
These places, ostensibly open for the purpose of
providing a cheap night?s amusement to the poorer classes,
are in reality dens where profligacy is encouraged to such an
extent, that virtue would blush to enter the doors; and a
place where virtue cannot enter, ought not to be allowed to
exist. The police enter casually, but they, looking upon it
as a necessary evil, make no report; they see a number of
jpersons of either sex enjoying themselves as they call it,
either by dancing, or listening to some one singing, and they
take no further notice; but, perhaps, they are encouraged in
such negligence by those at head quarters, or how would a
police staff be necessary ? We believe that were it properly
brought with all its horrors, under the notice of the powers
that be, the matter would be seriously taken in hand, and
these places thoroughly, and for ever rooted out of the
country. Oh ! it is sad to think of the number of young men


led from the paths of honor, of young women led from a
virtuous life, through visiting these abodes of vice. Let us
lay all bare to the public view. Turning from Elizabeth
Street up Bourke Street East, your attention is arrested
after going a few yards by flaming placards, announcing a
grand entertainment going on within. On casting your eyes
to the door, you see that it is the C y H 11.
Let us enter. In the passage you pay six-pence to an
individual in a box, who hands you a ticket through the
pigeon hole; proceed further on, and you come to a door, at
which a man is stationed, who, after receiving your ticket,
admits you into the hall. At first you can see nothing,
through the quantity of smoke rolling about the room,
emenating from numberless tobacco pipes, and your ears are
confused with a babel of tongues, the sounds of instruments
presided over by persons whose musical education must have
been sadly neglected, the jingling of glasses, the rustling of
dresses, the scraping of shoes on the floor. We will imagine
your eyes and ears to have become accustomed to the
strangeness. What do you see ? On the left is a counter,
behind which stand two females, who are dispensing liquors
to those who require them. Farther down the room is
another bar, devoted to the same purpose. At the bottom
of the hall is a raised stage, fitted with proscenium, and
having in front a few footlights. In front of the stage, on
the right-hand side of the hall, is a small platform, on which
are ensconsed the instrumentalists, one of whom is tinkling
on a broken-down pianoforte, and the other doing the
principal part of the work on a cornopean. Near the
entrance door, a flight of stairs takes you to the gallery,
where the more quietly disposed of the visitors can view what
is going on below them. Now notice what is passing around.
About one hundred men of different degrees, and some couple
of dozen females of the class styled unfortunate, are scattered
about the room, laughing and talking?talking ! but what


kind of talk ? Swearing and cursing are to be heard, no matter
where you go. Rake up all the most horrible language you
ever listened to in your life, and it may be deemed
respectable, to what you will hear in this place in a few
minutes. Hark! a blast from the cornopean, and from
some recess, a female appears on the stage. She is scantily
clothed, so scantily in fact, that none but the most abandoned
would appear before the public in the same manner. But
the applause which is liberally bestowed, and the remarks
made by those in the hall, show how attractive it is. She
dances, and as she twirls round and round, and jumps about
the stage, the sensualist looks on with admiration, while the
more vicious and abandoned of the females, criticize the
figure of the dancer in coarse and foul language, which
would not be permitted, were not all around alike depraved.
Custom being slack at the bars, a signal is given to the
musicians; a shrill notice from the trumpet follows, and a
person dubbed M.C. comes forward. Take your partners for
a waltz, it needs not a second call; those who can, seize a
partner, and clasped in each others arms, they whirl round
the room, till hot and panting, they rush to the bars, and
freely partake of the poisonous mixtures there vended.
Yes, not only the men, but the women are to be seen
drinking spirits without a drop of water. And as the hour
grows latex, the scene gets worse. Here is a woman affected
by drink, with torn dress and dishevelled hair, quarrelling
with another in the same condition, while a number of
debauchees form in a circle around, and by their ejaculations
incite them to still further rage. There you will see a
drunken sot with bloated countenance and bleared eyes,
vainly striving to comprehend what is transpiring. In
another spot, stretched at full length on the ground, against
the wall, is another worshipper of Bacchus, breathing heavily,
and muttering some unintelligible words, while a frothy
matter issues from his lips. And now a crowd rushes to


another part of the room, and cries of ? What?s the matter ??
11 Give her air ! Fetch some water ! Bring some brandy ? are
heard. All is confusion and bustle, a woman has taken a fit?
and there she lies struggling fiercely and groaning, while
it needs the strength of three or four to keep her from
tearing herself to pieces; water is plentifully poured over her,
and brandy is copiously administered, but she does not come
to, and she is carried out, placed in a cab, and driven to her
miserable home. This accident casts a depression on the
spirits of the revellers, which being noticed by the landlord,
another signal is given to the musicians, whose answer is a
quick and spirited galop. Away rush the women to all parts
of the room, and laying hold of a partner, by their blandish-
ments succeed in restoring hilarity, which continues until
interrupted by a fight between two brawny men, who are,
however, soon pitched into a right-of-way through the side
door, there to settle their differences.
And now it is twelve o?clock?closing up time. This is
the lewd woman?s hour, she throws out her web, a victim is
caught, perhaps in the form of a before virtuous youth, and
away he goes to the ? Steps that tahe hold on Hell." This
is the hour for the sensualist, he selects his partner, and they
retire. Nothing but profligacy all around, prostitution openly
solicited, modesty trampled under foot, the law deliberately
ignored, VICE FEIGNING TRIUMPHANT ! There
are other halls of the same description in different parts of the
city, while some are devoted entirely to entertainments, con-
sisting of singing and the enacting of farces, which are merely
disgusting exhibitions, having a tendency towards bawdiness.
Another place that has gained a great notoriety, is the
C o de Ye, also situated in Bourke Street, and
which is entirely devoted to dancing; but no respectable
woman ever enters the doors; it is a receptacle for those who
delight in carnal pleasures, and a temptation to the
unguarded. Now, the great attraction to these places is not


the amusement provided, for that is of a description not
worthy of attention, but the numbers of unfortunate women
who visit them, and unhappily Melbourne abounds with
them. Some occupy their degraded position, through the
machinations of those monsters of society, Seducers , those
fiends invested by the Almighty , with a pleasant and
favorable exterior, who almost make it the business of life
to entrap young and unprotected females into disgrace,
shame, and ruin. Young girls newly come into the country,
are one of the first marks for these gay young sparks, they
pounce upon them like a cat upon a mouse, but what a
difference ! one is natural instinct, the other a diabolical
outrage on nature, an outrage against society, an outrage
against God. And yet these scoundrels?these devils ?are
allowed to go unpunished, they beguile by their flattering,
caresses, promises, woman from virtue, they cause her to
be shunned by her own sex, sneered at by the other, they
make her very name a reproach, and instead of being
punished, they are smiled upon. The ladies say, ? Well,
he?s young, he must sow his wild oats, he?ll get steady as he
grows olderbut do they pity his victim ? No, she is branded
with the worst of names. Oh !it is pitiful, a crying disgrace
to our Legislature, to our Clergy, to mankind, that such
things should be. Let the seducer be punished, let his act
be a criminal one, or if not that, compel him to support the
sufferer for life, in a manner according to his income.
Others are brought up in vice, the children of vicious parents,
allowed to wander and beg in the streets in their infancy,
taught to steal in their youth, no good feelings are instilled
into their young minds, they know nothing but vice, and
they think it no sin, so they gradually fall lower and lower
in the scale of society, till they are known as the most
abandoned. Now, to suit this portion of the community, we
must have Free Schools, where it shall be compulsory for
them to attend. There they must be taught a strict code of


morals; let one part of the day be devoted to education,
and another to some employment, which would be the means
of their earning in the future a respectable livelihood, and
they would soon grow to feel the advantages of a virtuous
life, and act in accordance with such. And what shall we
say of the Servant?s Bazaars, the proprietors of which pander
to the lustful passions of men. They engage servant girls
to go to distant parts of the country, where the population is
thin, having previously kept them until all their little savings
are gone. When they get to their destination, they find
circumstances are not as they have been represented, coersion
is used; what can they do, possessing no means, poor things,
they fall; for a time they please, presently the appetite of
the seducer falls, familiarity breeds contempt, bad treatment
commences, she, (the dupe) has no alternative but to leave.
Her name gone, what resource has she ? Horror at the thought
of what she has become, makes her fly to strong liquors to
drown her memory; modesty then disappears, and at last she
is a confirmed street-walker?another addition to the numbers
who crowd our thoroughfares. How is this to be avoided ?
Keep a strict surveillance over these places. But a better plan
than all would be for the Government to organize a home for
servant girls, with a responsible person as superintendent,
and an efficient staff of respectable attendants. It would
cost the state nothing, because the fees charged would make
it self-supporting. Let the servants be engaged from this
place. WTiere there is no chance of making money, the
temptation to sin becomes less.
That the present act relating to publican?s has a tendency
to increase drunkenness, everybody we believe will allow, but
as a commission of enquiry is now investigating the matter,
it is not needful that much should be written on the subject
here; we will, however, remark that since the act came into
operation, public houses have so increased in numbers, that
the population cannot support them all, and therefore the


proprietors resort to dishonesty to gain their ends, they
adulterate their liquor to such a frightful extent, that in half
the houses in Melbourne it is rank poison. Let the
commission look to it.
The next eyil we hare to treat of is one of the greatest,
and yet, one favored and advocated by the great majority of
the people. We speak of Sunday traffic. Eailways, cabs,
carriages, roll forth in greater numbers on the Sabbath than
on any other day, in defiance of the direct commandment of
God, ? ? Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Six days
shalt thou labour and do all thy work : but the seventh day is
the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any
work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor
thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within
thy gates : for in six days the Lord made Heaven and Earth,
the Sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh
day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and
hallowed it." Here God directly and imperatively commands
that no labour shall be done on the day He has set
apart as one of rest: the master shall not labor, the
servant shall not work, neither the beast, nor any living
thing. Yet man, with his puny wisdom, dares mis-
interpret the words, and say that the seventh day is
for pleasure?worldly pleasure. We admit it is set apart for
pleasure, but it is the pleasure of rest and intercourse with
the divine being, our heavenly Father ! Ninety-nine out of a
hundred persons advocate the necessity of going to church
to hear divine truths enunciated; but with another breath
they advocate the very means that keep thousands, aye, tens
of thousands away from the house of God. We have heard
the argument, ? But there is no other day on which we can
visit our friends ; numbers of children on that day have an
opportunity of visiting their parents, parents of visiting their
children; again being confined to business all the week,
change is necessary.? We grant all this, but are confident


that it is the fact of the facilities given to Sunday travelling,
that causes this. Were the trains stopped, the cabs quieted
on this day, necessity would create some other time. But an
argument more potent and deciding than all others, is THE
COMMAND OF THE ALMIGHTY GOD, ? Remember
the Sabbath day to keep it holy.? Besides travelling,
Sunday traffic is carried on in numerous other ways, places
of business of every description are kept open to satisfy the
owners? love of gain. Public houses throw open their portals
to entrap the foolish, and bring the wicked still further into
sin. Tobacconists, confectioners, hairdressers, make this their
best day of business, yet no action is taken by our
authorities, they are tacitly encouraged; sometimes, certainly,
the police make a raid, and cause the premises to be closed,
but it is only for a short time; the duty is neglected, and one
after another, business is again openly carried on. It is a
matter easily rectified, once let the law be strict against such
offenders, let a heavy penalty be imposed for every breach of
it, and we are confident that soon our streets would present
the appearance of quietness, as ordained by the Creator.
Our task is done. Christians , Politicians , and Phitan-
throphists, arouse ye from the unnatural slumber in which
ye have remained so long, lift your voices, and wield your
pens, do your duty as men, and soon the world will bear a
happier appearance than it does at present.
Progress.
