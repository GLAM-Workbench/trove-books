LAID upon the Council Table hy the Colonial Secretary, hy Command of His Excellency the Lieutenant
Governor, and ordered ly the Council to he printed , 22 nd March , 1855.
Colonial Secretary?s Office,
9th December, 1854.
SIR,
The circumstance that in many quarters a prejudice exists against me has latterly been
forced upon my notice. ? , , ._ . ?
The allegations upon which the feeling has been founded, judging from proceedings at
public meetings, and from articles appearing in the newspaper press, are, I trust your Excellency
believes, as I know them to be, untrue. . .. . . ,
The fact, however, that such a prejudice exists cannot be doubted, and must act injuriously
to my efficiency as first minister of the Crown in this Colony. #
Should your Excellency therefore think that my remaining in office is an impediment to
your Government, I am ready to place my resignation in your hands. #
At the same time I beg most distinctly to state, that I have no wish to resign; on tne
contrary, I am most desirous to retain my office, and feel confident as to the ultimate judgment
which will be pronounced upon me by public opinion. . ,
It is merely a sense of duty that urges me to sacrifice my own interests, in order to render
more easy the Government of the country. .. . ,
Should your Excellency be pleased to accept my resignation, I would call to your notice the
peculiar circumstances in which I shall be placed. At present I have the honour to hold a
permanent office, which it has been arranged under the New Constitution should be converted
into one of a responsible nature, and in consideration of that change a compensation was awar ed
to me of ï¿½1000 per annum for life. , .. ,,
The contingency upon which it was intended that this should be paid has now practical y
arisen : but of this very handsome provision I shall be deprived by the step now taken by_me.
I would therefore respectfully submit to your Excellency that I am justly entitled to some
compensation for this sacrifice. -
In this view I am aware that your Excellency concurs, and I am quite willing to accept ot
any proposal on the subject emanating from the Executive Council, as suggested in conversation
by your Excellency.
I have, &c.,
(Signed) JOHN FOSTER.
His Excellency
The Lieutenant Governor,
