RISE AND PROGRESS OF QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIES.
GOLD.
W hen Queensland commenced its career as a separate colony, gold did
not figure to an appreciable extent among its products. Before
separation a great rush had taken place to the Port Curtis district,
which, though it did not lead to the discoveiy of any considerable
alluvial deposit, threw many thousands of men into what was then an
almost unknown part of the colony and founded the present town of
Rockhampton. In 1860 there were wandering parties of prospectors
who found a few patches here and there, and who were always animated
by the curious digger?s superstition?for the belief had little rational
foundation?that Queensland contained some great alluvial deposits.
It was not till 1863 that the Registrar of the colony found the
production of gold sufficiently important to be worth chronicling, and
the 8,000 oz. which he records seem to have been the produce mainly of
some patches in the Port Curtis district and the Peak Downs. The
prospectors, however, continued their search in likely looking places
and met with some moderate reward. In 1865 the colony exported
25,338 ozs., worth �92,938, the produce of several scattered little fields
of which 'Peak Downs was the principal. Still there was no sign of
any alluvial deposit rich enough to attract a rush, and in 1866 the
production had retrograded to a total value of <�85,521.
The colony was then, however, on the eve of its first important gold
discovery. In 1867 a prospector named Nash camped for the night in
a scrubby gully near the Mary River in what was then a wild country
occupied by only a few cattle stations. He found ?prospects? that
induced him to search further, and soon discovered that he had acci-


dentally come upon the richest alluvial deposit yet found in Queensland.
In a few weeks the discovery was known, and a ? rush? from the neigh-
boring settlements took place, followed presently by a still greater rush
from all parts of Australia as the fame of Gympie spread far and wide.
That year the export of gold was wortli �189,248, in 1868 it reached
�593,516, and gold mining took rank as one of the leading industries
of the colony. But Gympie, though an exceedingly rich alluvial field,
was very limited in extent, and so were the other patches at Kilkivan,
Imbil, etc., in its neighborhood. The reefs, however, at the first named
place attracted attention early, and of the gold easily won from the
alluvial in the outset much was invested in the more permanent work of
opening them up. And the roving diggers who came too late to share
in the alluvial lottery of Gympie found plenty of inducement to
remain in the colony. Hardly had the cream of the Gympie gullies
been skimmed when it became known that at Havens wood and Gilbert
River gold was to be found. The hardy diggers plunged at once into the
almost unexplored North, braving all the dangers of the tropical
wilderness and the numerous tribes of fiercely hostile savages. They
speedily found that in Northern Queensland the precious metal was
distributed over almost the whole country. Like children in a con-
fectioner?s shop, the diggers wandered from spot to spot, attracted first
by one deposit then by another. Indeed, in those wild solitudes
supplies could not reach them except by a long, difficult and dangerous
route, and it was only exceptionally rich patches that would yield
sufficient to recompense the miners. Many fields then discovered and
partly worked were abandoned again and remain yet almost untouched,
not because the reefs containing the precious metal are too poor, but
because their inaccessibility adds so greatly to the cost of working them,
that men will not attempt the task. The very magnitude of the
auriferous areas of the North also, and the fact that even now fresh
discoveries are being made, militates against their success. The miners
refuse to settle down to work unless tempted by exceptional chances of
profit, and for some years no alluvial deposit of sufficient magnitude to
hold a body of diggers together was found in the North.
Mining in Northern Queensland settled down with Charters Towers
as a main centre, and in Gympie the exploration of the reefs steadily
progressed. The total output of gold though fluctuating was increasing,
and by 1871 had reached a total value of �616,807. In that year,
also, it is worthy of note that the value of machinery on the gold fields
was estimated at �66,883. The alluvial had been for the most part
worked out, and the miners were turning to the more regular profits
obtainable from the hundreds of reefs that had been discovered. In
1872 the value of machinery had risen to �118,367, and the yield of
gold almost entirely from reefs was still increasing. And again the
colony was on the eve of another great discovery. An official exploring
party, traversing the unknown interior of the Cape York Peninsula,
found traces of gold. This hint sufficed for some adventurous
prospectors who were at the time living in the then main centre of
Northern mining, and by the end of 1873, it became known that
another great alluvial field had been found on the Palmer. Again
diggers came rushing to Queensland from all parts of Australia, and

the gold production of the colony, which had crept up to ,�717,540 in
1873, reached �1,383,710 in 1875, exceeding for the first time the
value of the export of wool. A great opportunity was offered for the
establishment of permanent gold mining in the far North, because not
only were there numbers of rich reefs in the Palmer field itself but
also in its neighborhood at a place called the Hodgkinson. The wide
shallow alluvial deposits would, in the ordinary course of mining, have
furnished the miners with funds that would have enabled them to open
the reefs, after the first speculative rush had subsided. This was what
happened at Gympie and laid the foundation of the sound permanent
mining industry established there. It would have happened in the
Cook district also but for an unforeseen event. The Chinese
came swarming in thousands from Hong Kong and closing up like a
flood round the footsteps of the European pioneers, succeeded in
diverting a considerable portion of the golden stream to China. For, unlike
the white digger, the Chinese never care to expose their winnings in the
alluvial lottery to the inevitable risk of regular quartz mining, pre-
ferring? to send away to China every ounce they can scrape together.
Consequently the reefers of the far North have had added to the
difficulties which nature has placed in their way the fact that they have
been compelled to depend mainly on outside capital for the long and
costly ? dead wrok? which must be undertaken in opening a new reefing
field.* These districts have therefore been peculiarly sensitive to the
general commercial depression which has visited the colonies. It is
difficult at all times to attract capital to a distant mining field, and
especially when from any cause a pressing demand for it exists in more
settled portions of the colony.
The yield of gold in 1879 was 288,556 oz. The Chinese who are
washing over and over again the Palmer drifts, find their earnings
decreasing year by year, and some thousands have left the colony or
taken to other pursuits. Last year the yield from that field was less
by 30,233 oz. than in 1878. But the permanent industry of quartz
mining shows a steady increase, as will be seen by the following table
taken'from the report of the Mines Department, giving the production
of the principal reefing districts ?

This table does not give the total quantity of quartz crushed
at each field, being compiled by the department from the re-
turns furnished by the machine owners. But it is accurate so far as
it goes?that is the results of each crushing is correctly given, although
all may not have been reported. And as it includes all but a very few
crushings, it gives a fairly correct average yield per ton of quartz. To
show how, for want of capital, the richest fields in the great auriferous
area of the North are neglected, the case of the reefing district of the
Palmer may be taken. It will be noticed that the average yield per
ton of quartz was 2oz. Idwt. 13grs., the gold is exceptionally pure, and
worth on an average �4 [2s. 6d. per oz., the reefs are fair-sized and
apparently permanent, and they exted over square miles of country.
Yet because the handful of miners there have no money to erect
pumping gear to free their claims of water, and buy proper mining
appliances, and because for the small amount of capital available for
mining purposes in the North, there are whole provinces intersected
with reefs in active competition ; the Palmer reefers are compelled to sit
idly by golden bodies of stone, or reluctantly obliged to abandon them.
The Queensland miners, especially in the North, must have high
earnings, or rather the stone must be sufficiently rich to pay for ex-
ceptionally costly methods for working, or they give up their claims to
seek for better fortune in the great auriferous areas at their disposal.
The Departmental report gives the average earnings of the miners
on the principal quartz fields?dividing the value of gold won by the
number of men engaged in winning it?

On the Hodgkinson and Palmer where the yield per man was
highest, there has been the greatest tendency to abandon claims. And
on these two fields there are 454 distinct lines of reef that have been
proved to be auriferous, besides thousands that have not yet been even
tested. The Etheridge, which the Under-Secretary for Mines describes
in his last report as a field likely to take first position in the colony,
has been almost taken up afresh during the last twelve months, having
been partially abandoned for years. The yield last year was accordingly
low because so many miners were engaged in ? dead work.?
These facts are sufficient to show that quartz reefing in Queensland
is merely in its infancy, whether by the more speedy process of the in-
troduction of fresh capital, or by the slower growth resulting from the
investment of money made out of one reef in the development of
another, quartz mining as an industry must grow to great dimensions
in the colony. Indeed, bearing in mind the extent of the Northern
fields, it is impossible to form even a conception of the limit it
may reach.
