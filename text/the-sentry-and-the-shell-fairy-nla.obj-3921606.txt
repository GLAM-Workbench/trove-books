The Queen of the Shell Fairies with some
of her Fairy Attendants.

I I there? " chal-
Mm: lenged the Sentry.
Wi It was one of those clear nights
If seen so often in tropical countries.
The moon slione with that brilliance
hoys and girls of the desert know
so well, and its very stillness seemed to
fill the air with myriad tiny voices.
For ten days the soldiers had been
camped at the base of the great Pyramid
in Egypt, and as the Sentry gazed at the
massive form of rock cut clear against
the night sky, he wondered why it was

there, who had built it, and what means
had helped most in the building of this
antiquity.
Such were his thoughts when a
gentle pressure on liis arm caused him
to turn. For, though he was thinking
about the Pyramid, yet, true to discipline,
he never forgot that thousands of Aus-
tralian and New Zealand soldiers were
sleeping soundly close at hand, trusting
in his alertness.
"Who are you?" he asked, as he
«/ '
came face to face with a dainty little
form.
"Ohl I'm a Shell Fairy. I've been
listening to your thoughts, and "
"Can you hear thoughts?" interrupted
the Sentry.
«y
"Oh, yes," was the reply, "thoughts
are audible to us, and I have come to
partially answer your thoughts."
"Only partially?"


The banks of the Nile were very fertile, giving
forth corn and other needs.

"Yes. Two things I cannot make
known Wliy the big Pyramid was built,
and who built it. Some day the sands
«y
will yield tbese answers and reveal many
«y
other wonderful things. But, I can tell
you something of interest, as we helped
tbe builders."
"Why! What could Fairies do to
help?"
"If you really want to know, come
«7 «7 /
to-morrow into the Queen's Chamber in
tbe Pyramid, and you'll hear tbe story."
«7 7 «y «y
"I'll come," replied the Sentry, but
the Fairy had vanished.
€/
Next day, the moment his leave was
«7 7
due, away across the sand sped the
soldier.
So dark was the passage, a few yards
from the entrance, that he had to feel bis
way along very carefully, but on turning
the first corner be found bis friend wait-
ing, attended by hundreds of little Fairies,
each with a light fixed to her forehead.

"These," she said, taking him by the
hand, "are the Pennant Fairies, the
hearers of brilliant light, who bring
radiance into every home."

And, walking along with the Shell
Fairy, the Soldier found that the soft,
•J 7
full glow from their tiny lamps lighted
the whole passageway.
As he entered the Queen's Chamber
he saw dozens of other little Shell
Fairies waiting attendance on their
Queen. Here, again, the Pennant
Fairies gave forth their best light, filling
the Chamber with splendour.
"Welcome to our friend from Aus-
tralia," sang the Queen, and all the
Fairies responded, singing, " Welcome,
ever Welcome."
"And so you really do wish to hear
how the Shell Fairies helped to build
this Pyramid?" said the Queen, as she
welcomed the Soldier.

"Yes: If it please your Majesty," was
the reply.
"Many centuries ago," began the
Queen, "Egypt was governed by a very
wise and kind ruler. The country was
very fertile, the banks of the Nile giving
forth abundantly corn and other needs.
Under bis government the people worked,
prospered and were happy. In the South,
gold was plentiful. Then there were
quarries, where these large stones came
from. The building of this Pyramid had
been going on for some years, but pro-
gress was slow, and an order was issued
urging them to hurry the work. Here
trouble started. As long as a medium
speed would do all was well, but when
called upon to do more, the wheels
driving the stone-cutters and the derricks
invented to lift these big stones into
place, groaned and squeaked and ran
hot —then ceased to work. To continue
at the old speed was not possible as the
Pyramid would not be completed in time

At night Ave sallied forth, each carrying a
Shell of precious Oil.

And so all the clever men in the realm
were ordered to solve tlie problem. They
worked day and night for weeks but
failed. The Ruler's palace stood where
the soldiers are encamped, and all around
was a beautiful garden with lakes and
terraces. Oh ! it was a pretty garden.
When he found the means and appliances
could not keep up the necessary speed,
the Ruler's heart was filled with dismay,
and, retiring In his favorite terrace, he
walked up and down through the long
night deep in thought, trying to find a
way to overcome Friction —that unseen
•7
enemy that hindered the building of the
Pyramid. T1 len a Shell Fairy touched
him 011 the arm, just as 1 made myself
known to you, and said, 'To-morrow
night your enemy will be destroyed. "
KJ «/ «- #/
"Next day we gathered hundreds of
shells and filled them with a beautiful
oil we brought from a country far across
the sea. At night, after all the men had


For centuries the Pyramids alone remained

left their work, we sallied forth eacli
carrying a shell of this precious oil. We
took out the fat and greasy stuff the men
had been using, and oiled well all the
working parts with the oil in our shells.
And, Oli!, what joy reigned everywhere
next morning. Far more speed than had
been asked for was obtained, and from
more trouble occurred and
(3 y ill id was finished in time."
"Years afterwards, trouble fell on the
land, and for centuries the Pyramids
alone remained a visible witness of the
glory of Egypt. And so the secret we
gave was lost to the world until we could
find a Nation worthy of it. To vour
Country we give the secret of power. All
machinery particularly motor car
engines has need of it. Take it! It
will destroy the enemy of progress
Friction —and all who use it wisely will,
« 7
in return, have speed with freedom from
trouble."


Thus was given to Australia and New
Zealand the secret which the whole world
has searched for, the knowledge how to
destroy Friction —that enemy of power.
Your Daddy may not know that lie
«y is
can to-day buy that same precious oil
*7 t/
used by the Shell Fairies. So, next time
t/
you are motoring with Daddy, tell him
about the Sentry and the Shell Fairy and
remind him to he sure and ask for:
MOTOR
SHELL OIL
LUBRICATING
The use of this wonderful Oil will
make his car run much more smoothly,
and you will all he as happy as that
ancient, wise and just Egyptian Ruler.
