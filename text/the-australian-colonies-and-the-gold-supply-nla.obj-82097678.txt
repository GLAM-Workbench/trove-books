~VXTHE NEVER the day shall arrive for writing the history of
? * the great island-continent of Australia, the task will be one
of transcendent interest, and the story one verging on romance.
The historian will have to describe the first settlement of a
country which by that time will probably be unsurpassed for its
riches and inferior to none of the States of Europe in poli-
tical importance; and to describe the early government, and trace
the gradual changes which converted a transmarine gaol into one
of the greatest communities of free men on the earth. He will
have to relate the progress of that vast pastoral interest, the source
of incalculable wealth, from the eight merinos imported by an enter-
prising emigrant* to the hundreds of millions of fine-woolled sheep
which will then w 7 ander over its enormous plains ; he will have to
record the process of emigration, from a few scattered farmers and
government officials, who for more than a quarter of a century

formed


formed the only voluntary additions to the population, to the time
when emigrants were shipped by thousands and tens of thousands
from the parent state ; he will have to note the price of land, from
the period when the bribe of free rations and convict labour was
needed to induce a colonist to accept it, until the time when lots
were sold at the rate of thousands of pounds per acre ; the wonder-
ful expansion of trade, from almost primitive barter to a steady
export of many millions sterling in wool, tallow, copper, and gold ;
and above all that marvellous transformation, by which a territory
long known only as the despised and abhorred convict colony of
Great Britain became the place in all the world in which labour
was best rewarded, population most rapidly augmented, and life
most easily sustained.
We are lost in astonishment when we look hack at the early
history of New South Wales. Under an absolute, and too often
a tyrannical government, the first settlers were crowded together
on a narrow strip of ground, a promontory partially cleared of a
dense forest. The soil was a barren sand, and every yard required
for cultivation had to be gained by felling enormous trees of a
hardness that tried the temper of the keenest axe. On one side
was an unexplored shore and a solitary sea ; on the other an appa-
rently boundless waste, in which not a step could be taken
without danger of being totally lost, and which produced no wild
fruit or root fit for the sustenance of man, and, with the ex-
ception of a wandering kangaroo or a shy emu, no animal or game
of any size fit for human food.
The want of enterprise which marked the career ol the early
colonists must doubtless be attributed to the moral peculiari-
ties of their position. The mass of the community was com-
posed of men who, transported to the Antipodes, might be there
properly denominated slaves, and their slavery was of the most in-
tolerable description, ?incessant and unrequited toil, the more dis-
heartening because altogether unproductive. These miserable out-
casts, in the infancy of the transportation system, were alternately
scorched by the fierce rays of a burning sun, and petrified with
cold, and not unfrequently half starved by the insufficiency of
their rations. ? I have known,? said a liberated convict, ? a man
commit a murder for a meal. I would myself have committed
three murders for a meal.? Death was often inflicted for the most
trifling crime, and a sullen look or a reproachful word was
punished without mercy by the lash. In one of the periodical
visitations of famine to which the colony was exposed, it was
said that a Governor, although he put his prisoners on quarter
rations, ordered a whole ration daily for his dog. Ihe act is,
doubtless,


doubtless, exaggerated ; but the general belief in the story strongly
illustrates the state of feeling which prevailed. To add to the
depravity of the people, for more than twenty years after the
formation of the settlement, spirits were its ordinary currency.
Almost all extra work was thus remunerated ; and the labour
of convicts in unloading a vessel freighted with Government stores
was generally stimulated by rum. Intoxication is still a very
prevalent vice of the Australian population. Many modifications
and improvements of the early transportation system were, from
time to time, introduced, the condition of the convict was greatly
ameliorated, and prospects were held out to him of an ultimate
restoration of civil rights. The more respectable prisoners were
granted many indulgences. One convict is said to have laid the
foundation of an enormous fortune by selling his daily ration of
rum. When well conducted and intelligent, these outcasts were
occasionally taken into the confidence of their employers. They
kept themselves, however, socially in the back ground, in order
that their children might come forward and stand on an equal
footing with colonists.
Banishment has been, from a very early period, an ordinary
punishment among civilized nations. There is an instinctive
desire on the part of every advanced community to get rid of its
criminal population, for the sake both of its moral health and
social security. It is extremely convenient, doubtless, to shoot
our moral refuse upon distant shores ; and some countries have not
been very particular in their choice of a locality for that purpose.
It was once the custom of Guernsey and Jersey to banish their
criminals to England ; that is to say, to land them at Southampton,
and there leave them free to go where they pleased so long as they
did not revisit the Channel Islands. In the same manner the smaller
German Principalities have been known to pay the passage of
criminals whom their forms of law prevented from executing with-
out a confession of guilt, in order to save the expense of their
maintenance during a perpetual imprisonment. At Hamburg a
few years ago it was accidentally discovered that the official repre-
sentative of one of the northern Dukedoms had arranged to
despatch a small batch of murderers, burglars, and forgers, by an
emigrant ship bound to New York ; but the ?exiles,? having made
too free a display of pistols and daggers, with which, as stock
in trade, they had provided themselves, the paternal intentions
of the German Prince were frustrated, and they were sent back
to their indulgent Sovereign with the shortest possible delay.
In England the Act of 39 Elizabeth, c. 4, first authorised the
banishment of rogues and vagabonds. The Government of James I.
B 2 addressed


addressed a letter to the Council for the Plantations, command-
ino- it to send to Virginia a hundred dissolute persons whom
the Knight Marshal would deliver for that purpose; but, in
the same year, as a kind of counterpoise to these ? dissolute per-
sons,? the company sent ?ninety agreeable girls, young and in-
corrupt;? and again, in 1621, sixty more ?maids of virtuous edu-
cation, young .and handsome.? ? The first lot of females,? says
an historian of the day, ?brought 120 lbs. of tobacco each, and the
second 150 lbs. each.?
The first distinct notice of the modern transportation system
is to be found in 18 Car. 11. c. 3, which gives the judges power,
at their discretion, to execute or to transport for life the moss-
troopers of Cumberland and Northumberland. The punishment
was inflicted frequently in an illegal manner up to the reign of
George 1., when its operation was extended and legalized.
During the reign of James 11. transportation, or rather reduction
to slavery, was a favourite, and, to many parties, a profitable
punishment. Dr. Lingard quotes a petition setting forth that
seventy persons, who had been apprehended on account of the
Salisbury rising bf Penruddock and Grove, after a year?s impri-
sonment, had been sold at Barbadoes for 1550 lbs. of sugar.
Among them were divines, officers, and gentlemen, who were
represented as ? grinding at the mills, attending at the furnaces,
and digging in that scorching island, whipped at whipping-posts,
and sleeping in sties worse than those of hogs in England.? *
Even before the commencement of the American war, the intro-
duction of the negro to the plantations had made the proprietors
averse to the further importation of convicts, and the act umula-
tion of criminals in our gaols at its close became an embarrassing
question for the Government. Projects for the renewal of
transportation became subjects of frequent discussion among states-
men and philanthropists. Rebellious America resolved in future
to employ no slaves who had not, at least, 25 per cent, of black
blood in their veins, and to receive no more rascals from England
except those who had escaped unconvicted. The annual accu-
mulation of rogues was somehow to be got rid of, and Australia
naturally presented itself as an eligible penal colony. Its remote-
ness afforded a security against escape, and its size a guarantee
against the possibility of overstocking it with a convict popula-
tion. From that period criminals were, to use a familiar term,
shovelled out of the mother country by shiploads. It was believed,
certainly at first on insufficient grounds, that the place of banish-
* Roberts?s ?Duke of Monmouth,? vol. ii., p. 248.
ment


merit could be made self-supporting, and the prisoners, at all
events, would cease to be a nuisance.
It was only after an obstinate adhesion to a system of which
the evils had long been glaringly conspicuous, and when discon-
tent had been aggravated almost to insurrection, that transportation
on system was finally abandoned. Our convict-ships were at last
refused admission to the ports of their destination ; the colonists of
Port Phillip drove them from their harbour to Sydney ; the people
of Sydney ordered them to shape their course to Tasmania ; Tas-
mania was equally resolute, and refused to accept the foul cargoes ;
and when the Government of the day, as a last resource, resolved
to convert the fine settlement of the Cape into a penal reservoir,
the spirit of resistance was so menacingly displayed that the
Imperial Government abandoned with precipitation its ill-con-
sidered plans. The only colony which now receives convicts is
Western Australia. In consequence of the scarcity of free labour
the old system is gladly acquiesced in, for the present: indeed
without it the land would be valueless, and the country would
probably be abandoned. Transportation has two aspects: it
may be made a punishment of terrible severity by the adoption
of a system of which the unutterable horrors of Norfolk Island
were the necessary result. If humanized and made endurable,
it operates less as a penal infliction than as a bounty upon
crime. The time, too, must arrive in every settlement when the
respectable population will resent the further introduction of
convicts who would at length convert the most promising region
into a moral lazar-house. The country has experienced the evils
of both systems, and has now, properly, abandoned the practice
of deporting her criminals to distant lands.
It appears that in the year 1792 there were only 67 free
settlers in New South Wales. They held 3400 acres of land,
of which only 400 were in cultivation and 100 more cleared.
These settlers were generally victualled and clothed from the
public store for eighteen months from the time of taking pos-
session of their grants, furnished with tools and implements of
husbandry, with grain to sow their land, such cattle as could be
spared from the public stock, and as many convicts as they would
undertake to clothe and employ. The difficulty of clearing the
district on which the city of Sydney now stands was so great, that
without compulsory convict labour, employed for nearly a quarter
of a century, it probably would never have been accomplished. The
tone of society was for a long period of the lowest possible descrip-
tion. ?ln the towns,? says a trustworthy and accomplished colo-
nial writer, ?it was horrible ; no educated or honourable class ;


no church worthy of the name ; no schools except for the wealthy,
and these taught chiefly by convicts ; slave-masters who sold rum ;
slaves who drank it; an autocrat surrounded by parasites, whose
fortune he could make by a stroke of his pen: except military
honour, and the virtue cherished by a few that lived apart, there
was as little virtue and honour as freedom in this wretched, pros-
perous community.? *
When the system of free grants of land was superseded by that
of sales, the character of emigration to Australia, as well as the
motives which directed it, materially changed. To Australia
previous to 1824 had proceeded, in small numbers, the same class
of persons who by thousands have resorted of late years to Canada
and the Western States of America, namely, families with capital
varying from fifty to five hundred pounds, desirous of living on
land of their own. But the great want of the colony was a free
labouring population, and an effort was made, by the instru-
mentality of an emigration commission, to supply the settlers
with a sufficiency of workmen, the cost of their conveyance .to
the colonies being defrayed from the produce of land sales.
The labour-market of England could thus, it was supposed, be
relieved of its redundance, and all classes both in the colony
and the mother-country proportionably benefited.
The problem in colonization has always been to adjust the
interests and settle the relative proportions of labour and capital.
Without the former, land purchased at the rate even of a shilling
an. acre would be valueless ; without the latter, only the most rude
and unskilful attempts could be made at agriculture. Without a
sufficiency of labour to carry out his projects, the possessor of the
finest domain which the noblest colony of the British Crown
could supply would find himself in a position of miserable help-
lessness and isolation. There exists, in a work now out of
print, a curious and very graphic description of the disappoint-
ment which an English gentleman experienced in Australia, after
having invested a considerable fortune in land. In ? A Letter
from Sydney,? which was published in the year 1830, and has
been attributed, we believe correctly, to Mr. Edward Gibbon
Wakefield, of colonial celebrity, the writer says, ? I have got 20,000
acres for a mere trifle, and I imagined that a domain of that
extent would be very valuable. In this I was wholly mistaken.
As my estate cost nearly next to nothing, so it is worth next to
nothing. The trees on my property, if growing in any part of
England, would be worth at least 150,000/. The best tiling that

could


could happen to me would be the annihilation of all this natural
produce ; but the cost of destroying it would be at least 15,000/.?
l ie then proceeds to enumerate the mines of iron and coal which
would make him ? a Peer in England,? but which are valueless
for want of labour and roads. ? I do not, you know,? he says,
? intend to become a farmer. Having fortune enough for all my
wants, I proposed to get a large domain, to build a good house,
to keep enough land in my own hands for pleasure-grounds,
park, and game preserves, and to let the rest, after erecting harm-
houses on suitable spots. My mansions', park, preserves, and
tenants, were all a mere dream. There is no such class as a
tenantry in this country, where every man who has capital to
cultivate a farm can have one of his own.? He then graphically
describes the miseries of a solitary life to a man accustomed to
the elegant luxuries of civilization. His ? own man ? leaves
him and invests his savings in a farm. Pie imports labourers
and mechanics from England, and they quit him without re-
paying the cost of their passage. He observes to his friend,
?Were you a broken farmer, or a poor lieutenant, I should
say come here by all means; you cannot be placed more un-
happily than at present, and you may gain by the change. Put
I am advising a man of independent fortune, who prefers his
library even to the beauties of nature, and to whom intellectual
society is necessary for his peace of mind. I thought at one
time of establishing a dairy, but my cows were as wild as hyenas,
and almost as wicked. 1 had no dairy-woman, no churns, no
anything that was wanted ; and, above all, 1 wanted industry,
skill, economy, and taste for any such pursuits, or, at least, a
drudge of a wife to supply those wants.? Pie then paints an
amusing picture of society in a small colonial town.
In the same work is contained an account of a Scotch gentle-
man of ancient lineage, affording a striking example of what
may be done in a colony by industry and hard work, with the
help of a large family, and without that amount of capital winch,
according to some theorists, it is indispensable that a settler
should possess. He arrived in the colony the owner of an eighty
acre section, with twelve children, one-half of whom were stout,
well-grown ? lads and lasses;? his whole property consisted of a
little furniture, a gun or two, a very little ready money, and several
barrels of oatmeal and biscuit. His section had been selected
for him previous to his arrival. It lay on the other side of a
steep range of hills over which no road had been made, ten
miles from the town. He found out a fellow countryman, who
lent him a team of oxen, and, having dragged his goods over
the


the hills to his land, he encamped the first night on the
ground under a few blankets and canvas spread on the brush
The family worked at felling trees till there was timber suf-
ficient for building a house. This house, situated on the slope
ot a hill, consisted of one long low wooden room, surrounded
jy a dry ditch to drain off the rain, and divided into parti-
tions by blankets. The river ran below. When water was
needed, it was brought in a bucket by one of the young ladies.
A garden, in which many descriptions of vegetables, including
tobacco and water-melons, grew apace, was laid out almost
as soon as the house ; an early investment was made in poultry
which required no other food than grasshoppers and grass-
seeds. Until the poultry produced eggs and chickens, the guns
of the lads supplied quail, ducks, and parrots. In due time a
crop of maize, of wheat, and of oats was got in. Before the
barrels of oatmeal were exhausted, eggs, chickens, and potatoes
afforded ample provision, and something to send to market.
Labour cost nothing, fuel nothing, rent nothing, ? keeping up
appearances nothing, first a few goats, then a cow, eventually
a fair herd of stock were accumulated. Butter and vegetables
found their way to the neighbouring town. The barelegged
boys of the Highland gentleman soon became independent, and
the daughters, who were ? pretty, proud, and useful,? obtained ex-
cellent husbands, and in another generation the family which
commenced with a capital of a hundred or two hundred
pounds will probably be found among the wealthiest of the
colony.
I he great increase which has taken place in the emigration to
Australia since the discovery of the gold-fields has made all
theories of colonization as applied to that country comparatively
unimportant. Previously to the social revolution which gold
has effected, the labouring class consisted chiefly of distressed
agricultural peasants and their wives, whose passages were de-
frayed out of the rent and sales of waste land. A self-paying
emigration has now, to a great extent, superseded the Govern-
ment emigration. While the gold-fields are sufficient to attract a
steady stream of self-supporting emigrants, those who discover
that they are unfit for such laborious work find employment in
tending flocks and herds. Every gold-digger, it is said, gives
occupation to at least three other men in feeding and clothing
him. Sheep, formerly almost worthless, except for their fleece,
are now in steady demand for food; and land, which seemed?
likely to be unprofitable for ages, is acquiring a high and annually
increasing value.


In the history of the world there is scarce anything that
can be compared to the rapidity with which these colonies
have progressed in wealth and population. In 1788 the British
ensign was first hoisted on the silent and solitary shores of
Sydney Cove. The little colony, when first established, con-
sisted of only 1030 individuals; it now numbers 310,000 souls.
Its stock consisted of one bull, four cows, one stallion, three
mares and three colts. According to the latest official returns
the live stock of New South Wales numbered horses 168,929;
horned cattle 2,023,418 ; sheep 7,736,323 ; pigs 105,998.*
Sydney possesses a Royal Mint, which coined in the year 1857,
499,000 sovereigns, and 537,000 half sovereigns, or gold cur-
rency of the value of 767,500/., and in 1858, of the value
of 838,500/. A magnificent Protestant cathedral is building,
though its progress is slow at present. The University is
another noble edifice. The completion of its vast hall, with its
gorgeous stained windows, was celebrated by a grand musical
performance a few months since. A town hall is about to be erected
that is intended to accommodate five or six thousand persons. Rail-
ways are making slow but steady progress, and the electric tele-
graph now connects the capital with the provinces and with the
neighbouring colonies of Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania.
The economical condition of a city is best known by the returns
of its occupations. From the ? Directory of Sydney,? published in
1858, we find that there were 111 merchants, 31 importers, 8
custom-house agents, 84 brokers, 40 auctioneers, 25 warehouse-
men, 68 cornfactors and dealers in produce, 37 timber-merchants,
12 wool-brokers, 8 potato, and 11 coal and fuel merchants, 13
millers and 6 flour merchants, 32 wine and spirit merchants,
287 grocers, 193 butchers, 97 bakers, 84 greengrocers, 32 confec-
tioners, 10 poulterers, 22 dairymen, 6 fishmongers (about 60 street
salesmen), 487 publicans, 307 shoemakers, 183 tailors, 127
drapers, 15 hatters, 43 dressmakers, 38 milliners, 54 architects
and engineers, 128 builders, 241 carpenters, 134 masons, 44
quarrymen, 8 brickmakers, 56 plasterers, 147 painters and glaziers,
108 upholsterers, 89 smiths, 18 brassfounders, 49 ironmongers,
27 earthenware dealers.
Eleven hundred vessels entered the ports of New South Wales
during the year 1857, of a gross burthen of 351,413 tons, and
manned by 18,728 sailors. The amount of shipping, taken as a
whole, represents pretty nearly the extent of the internal and
external commerce of the colony. The number of vessels re-

gistered


gistered for the year ending 31st December, 1857, including
steamers, was 500; the gross tonnage being 52,661 tons, em-
ploying about 3757 men and boys, and the imports at the port
of Sydney have risen from 1848, when they were 1,182,874/.,
to 6,729,408/. in 1857, and the exports from 1,155,009/. to
4,011,592/. The boundless supply of excellent coals from the
Newcastle mines, within 80 miles of Sydney, will materially
add to the exports. About 5000 tons are at present shipped
weekly, and two new mining companies are on the point of
commencing extensive operations.
But the province of New South Wales has been thrown into
comparative shade by her brilliant daughter Victoria, Before
the year 1851 Melbourne was an inconsiderable place, not much
larger than a small English market town. It had been chosen as
a site for an encampment in 1835. In 1837 Sir Richard Bourke,
then Governor of New South Wales, paid it a visit, and found it
rising into a prosperous community. The district possessed some
pastoral advantages and a good soil, and he named the town
Melbourne, in honour of the English premier. The infant city
continued in a state of sluggish life until 1851, when it awoke
to sudden animation on the astounding discovery that it was
planted in a region thickly sown with gold, and in which fortunes
might be realised in a few weeks by picking up the riches
profusely scattered in many places even on the surface oi the
earth. The great discovery of 1851 was nearly anticipated in
1804 at a spot not far from where the city of Melbourne now
stands, H. M. S. ? Calcutta ? was employed on surveying duties
in that year on the coasts of New Holland, and, in the course of
a walk by the officers and some of the crew round the harbour
of Port Phillip, a stream was discovered, where ?the hopes of the
seamen were excited by the sight of sparkling sand which they
took for gold, but of course ,? the writer adds, ?it was only mica.? *
The shining spangles which Lieut. Tucker took for granted were
only mica were in all probability the first flakes of Australian
gold presented to the eyes of Europeans.
Amongst the records of the early attempts to form the settle-
ment of Port Phillip, there is preserved a document which proves
that it was actually abandoned by the first colonists. Colonel
Collins, under the date of 31st Dec, 1803, wrote a General
Order in the following terms: ?? It has never been my wish
to make the sabbath-day other than a day of devotion and
rest, but circumstances compel me to employ it in labour. In
Lieut. Tucker?s Voyage in H.M.S. ? Calcutta,? 1803-4.


this the whole are concerned, since the sooner we are enabled to
leave this unpromising and unproductive country, the sooner shall
we be able to reap the advantage and enjoy the comforts of a more
fertile spot.? Colonel Collins directed his attention to Tasmania,
whither he transferred the whole of his people, leaving behind
him, in despair or disgust, a district which was to become one of
the wonders of the world.
We know not how its amazing growth and rapid prosperity
can be better realised than by the simple statement that the
province of Victoria now contains 211 post towns, the most
distant of which is 270 miles from the capital. In the year 1851
the population of the province was 77,345 persons, of whom
28,143 were congregated in the city of Melbourne. In March,
1857, the population numbered 410,766, of whom 99,345 were
located in Melbourne. In June, 1858, the population of the
province had increased to 477,345, and it now probably exceeds
500,000. In an excellent periodical, edited at Melbourne by
the Assistant Registrar-General, and entitled ? Facts and Figures ;
or Notes of Progress, Statistical and General, for Australian Cir-
culation,? are the following remarks :
? This is an age of marvels; and of all the marvellous facts of the
nineteenth century, the rapid and solid growth of the colony of
Victoria is not the least marvellous. The metropolis is a fair index
of her extraordinary development. Two-and-twenty years since this
city had no existence; and to-day its inhabitants are ten-fold more
numerous than the forest-trees they have supplanted. The green
sward, that was wont to be pressed by the indolent foot of the wild
man, has disappeared beneath the steady, active, ceaseless tread of the
white; and the birds and the beasts that afforded the aborigines a
precarious existence have fled from the bustle and hum some
hundred thousand workers, who have swarmed from the old hives cf
civilization.?
It is not to the material greatness and opulence of this city
which has risen, as it were, by enchantment on the banks of the
Yarra Yarra, which lately rolled its turbid waters through sedgy
banks and an unpeopled wilderness, that we are able to point
with the greatest satisfaction, but to its intellectual and moral
development, which appears now to proceed pari passu with
its commercial importance. Melbourne is well provided with
Episcopal churches and an effective working clergy; but, from
the manner in which it was populated, and the unexampled
eagerness with which persons of all classes and denominations
rushed to its locality, it may be supposed that almost every form
of religious belief has its representatives. The progress, how-
ever, of the Church of England in the colony of Victoria has
been so far satisfactory, that it has gained upon a population
increasing

increasing with almost unparalleled rapidity.* Melbourne pos-
sesses twelve religious societies actively engaged in diffusing their
respective tenets, and embracing the whole colony in the scope
of their ministrations. There are thirteen benevolent, and several
temperance societies. Freemasonry seems to thrive with extra-
ordinary energy, the lodges in the Victorian metropolis amounting
to not less than 60, some of which bear singular titles, such as
the Sovereign Chapter of Knights of the Eagle and Pelican, the
P. P, Princess Rose Croix, King Solomon?s Lodge, the Lodge
of Hiram, and the Lodge of Judah. The societies of Odd
Fellows prove their loyalty and their patriotism by designating
their lodges the Victoria, the Rose of England, the Britannia, the
Rose of Brunswick, the Prince of Wales, and the Prince Albert;
and to perpetuate the military glory of their native land, three
are named respectively the Wellington, the Collingwood, and the
Napier.
The cultivation of literature is increasing in a degree that
could scarcely be expected from a city the normal state of which
might naturally be conceived as one of all-absorbing com-
mercial activity and intense thirst for gold. Yet we find that
Melbourne possesses a public library containing 13,214 volumes,
many of which are of a costly character. The Home Govern-
ment has liberally contributed, and the Emperor of the French
has given some munificent presents. The number of readers was
in 1856, 23,769; in 1857, 49,226; in 1858, 77,924; and for the
first three months of 1859 the number was 23,529, or at the rate
of 85,724 per annum. The Assembly has recently voted 2000/.
for obtaining casts of the best works of art. There are three
daily papers published at Melbourne, eighteen weekly newspapers

and other periodicals, eight monthly journals, one quarterly, and
several annuals. Very great interest is taken in intellectual
training; its importance is thoroughly recognised ; and we find
it stated, on satisfactory authority, that a superior education is
now obtainable in Australia.
The wealth of Melbourne and the progress of Victoria will be
best elucidated by a few figures. The assessed annual rental of
property in Melbourne was in 1843, 91,270/.; in 1854, 2,330,947/.
For the province of Victoria the total imports were in 1851,
1,056,437/.; in 1857, 17,256,209/. The total value of imports
during seven years was 82,499,296/.* The number df ships
and vessels entered inwards at the Custom-house in Victoria in
1851 was 710; in 1857 it was 2190. The tonnage in 1851
was 128,959 tons; in 1857, 694,564 tons. The number of men
employed in 1851 was 7785 ; in 1857, 34,777. The increase
in the number of vessels has consequently been 208 per cent.
The departures in 1851 comprised 657 vessels of all classes,
having a total tonnage of 110,659 tons. In the year 1857 the
number of ships cleared outwards at the various custom-houses
in Victoria was 2207, with a tonnage of 684,826, and they were
manned by 33,928 sailors.
It is in the character of a gold-producing country that Aus-
tralia now excites the greatest attention. The great colony
pours into the markets of Europe an annual supply of upwards
of ten millions sterling of the precious metal, giving a stimulus
to industry and an expansion to trade greater than has taken
place since the discovery of America. It was long a common
belief that Australia was a country but of yesterday, and the
youngest of those continents that had been upheaved from the
ocean bed. Further investigation has proved it to be one of
the most ancient. The auriferous districts of Australia are en-
circled by vast ranges of granitic, porphyritic, and metamorphic
rocks, crowned, in many places, by naked needles and tooth-
formed peaks, which give a bold character to the scenery,
and render the mountains in many places difficult of access.

These mountain ranges once formed gigantic barriers against the
intrusion of winds that blew over a wild waste of waters. From
Mount Kosciusco, the loftiest of the Australian Alps, the eye
sweeps over an area exceeding 7000 square miles. The whole
of the low interior was unquestionably once a sea-bed, and the
process of slow elevation has so changed the configuration of
the whole as to make a continuous continent of that which had
once been an archipelago of islands. Viewed from almost any
very elevated point, the greatest portion of this enormous country
presents an appearance like that of the ocean seen from a lofty
cliff; tfie undulations and refractions of the atmosphere presenting
the semblance of waves, while estuaries and bays seem to penetrate
the bases and Avind between the spurs of the hills. Impetuous
currents must have once swept along the shores of multitudinous
islands, depositing the accumulated detritus which they carried
along with them in their tumultuous course. The interior, in
various places, possesses vast stony deserts and sandy plains
which exhibit a regularity and a surface that water alone could
have given. Captain Sturt, in one of his exploring expeditions,
encountered one of these remarkable wastes, which he thus
describes :
? The stones with which the earth was so thickly strewed, so as to
exclude vegetation, were of different lengths, from one inch to six;
they had been rounded by attrition, were coated over with oxide of
iron, and were evenly distributed. In going over the dreary waste
the horses left no track, and that of a cart was only visible here and
there. The fragments covering this singular feature were all of the
same kind of rock?indurated or compact quartz.?
In another part of his work he says :
� Our ride was over a singularly rugged country, of equally singular
geological formation; nor can I doubt that one time there were cur-
rents sweeping over it in every direction. At one place that wo
passed there was a broad opening in a rocky but earth-covered bank.
Through this opening the eye surveyed a long plain, which at about
two miles? distance was hounded by low dark hills. Along this plain
the channel of a stream was as distinctly marked in all its windings
by small fragments of snow-white quartz as if water had been there
instead.?*
As this kind of surface extends over enormous areas, the
superficial extent of Australia affords no true index to the terri-
tory really available for colonization. A great portion of the
interior is more hopelessly barren than the deserts of Africa,

being


being in summer a hollow basin of burning sand, and in rainy
seasons a vast shallow inland sea. But if the action of water has
done much to impoverish a large portion of this great country,
it has, in another sense, abundantly enriched it. Water has been
the principal agent in those grand debacles that, in ages of inde-
finite remoteness, have broken up, pulverised, and dispersed the
great mountain masses and their mineral contents, that are now
superficially diffused over the continent, or buried deep under
its trackless sands.
Australia has been the theatre of igneous action on an enormous
scale, and to that action and its influence upon the contiguous
strata may probably be chiefly attributed the formation of gold.
The most prolific gold-fields in Victoria are in regions where the
old formations are pierced by igneous rocks which have flowed
from extinct volcanoes, and some of the richest alluvial deposits
have been found covered by beds of lava, many feet in thickness,
through which the miner- has had to sink his shaft. By what
exact agency, and at what geological epoch, gold was formed in
the submarine mountain chains must probably always remain
a secret. It exists chiefly in quartz veins which are seen ex-
tensively traversing the Lower Silurian strata, and was probably
elaborated by thermo-electrical action induced during the period
of the vast igneous eruptions.
In Victoria the gold-drifts constitute at least three distinct
deposits, the result of successive upheavals and depressions, and
these three auriferous deposits sometimes occur in the same lo-
cality, and the miner finds, in the course of his working, a first,
second, and third bottom, the last being always on the solid and
unmoved palaeozoic rock, from which all the gold has been
derived. The richness of some of these deep drifts or ? gutters
of gold almost exceeds belief. In a visit which the author of one
of the latest works on the Victoria gold-fields paid to the cele-
brated shafts called the ? Jewellers? Shops,? he ascertained the
following extraordinary facts :
? I made my first descent in what was called the ? Blacksmith?s
Claim,? being opened by a person of that craft. It was about the
most slovenly and ill-sunk shaft I ever ventured down, being so far
from the perpendicular that at times the half of the orifice above was
obscured; and it was slabbed in so insecure a manner that flakes of
stuff were being constantly forced through the wide slits, falling down
to the imminent danger of the people below. The danger was fear-
fully aggravated by the partial tipping over of the buckets while
ascending, from their contact with the irregular sides of the shaft,
at times upsetting half their contents. The blacksmith?s party was
composed of eight persons, most of them novices in their new profes-
sion, which accounts for the faulty construction of the shaft. When
they


they reached the gutter on the bottom, being ignorant of the proper
mode of carrying on the workings, they washed out all the stuff they
could reach without opening a regular drive, and after dividing 1600?.
per man (12,800?.), they offered it for sale. Several parties of in-
spection went down without making a bid, being frightened at the
appearance of the shaft, as well as at the wetness and rottenness
of the ground below. At length one party plucked up courage,
purchasing all right and title to the claim and utensils for 77?.
They entered into possession at noon, and on the same day (Satin-
day) divided 200?. per man (2000?,). Charmed with their luck, they
continued working in spells night and day, until the following Mon-
day, when they declared another dividend of 800?. per man (10,000?.
in all), when they sold out for a week, then to regain possession.
? The succeeding party, whose purchase-money I could not ascertain,
were regular bred miners, who went about their business with their
eyes open. They spent the first four days of their term in opening
two regular drives, one at the point where the gutter entered the
shaft, and the other where it made its exit. It was during their
occupation that I descended ; but if I was offered 10,000?. for twenty-
four hours? work at the bottom I would have declined the employment,
for, what from the falling dirt splashing in the water around me, the
cracking and straining of the bent slabs, and the thin line of light
to be discovered at the top, I thought I was certain to defraud the
undertaker; and when I came above ground I felt like a person who
was released from a coffin which had been prematurely nailed down.
Not so, however, the temporary proprietors, who, before the three
remaining days had elapsed, took out an amount of gold which di-
vided 1200?. per man to a party of twelve men (14,400?.). The other
party then re-entered, and, after digging out 900?. per man (9000?.) in
a week, principally by day-work, they sold out to a well-known store-
keeper, Mr. N , for 100?., who put in a gang of men to work it in
shares. After a fortnight?s irregular work they divided 500?. per
man (5000?.), when one of them, an old hand, undermined the props
on a Saturday night, and before Monday morning the whole work-
ings fell in. This fellow then marked out a claim on the sur-
face of the ruin, and went down straight as an arrow on the old
gutter, having engaged a hired party. The first tubfull (four bucket-
fuls) they raised turned out 40 lbs. weight of coarse gold, and two
others yielded 10 lbs. each, after which he took gold amounting in the
aggregate to 4000?., raising the value of the whole amount taken out
to the prodigious and unprecedented figure of 55,200?., from an area
of twenty-four feet square, an amount unequalled in the annals of
gold-digging, and which may never be again paralleled.?*
It is a remarkable fact that these rich gullies are seldom
traceable to any existing quartz-reef, but evidently originated in
the debris of older mountain masses, which have undergone a

process


process of disintegration, and were doubtless deposited by strong
currents, in remote ages, in the spots where they are now found.
This leads us to remark a conspicuous difference between the
gold deposits of Australia and California, which has a great
geological significance.
The gold of California is found in the midst of, or contiguous
to, the existing great mountain ranges, amidst regions of peaked,
jagged, irregular crests and upheaved and distorted strata, the un-
doubted effects of internal convulsions. It has not, however, selected
as its resting-place the smooth levels and hanging slopes of the con-
tiguous hills. The metal, ground finer and finer as it is carried
forward by the torrents that year after year tear up the river-beds,
finally settles in the form of fine flakes or dust along the banks and
at the bottoms of the great streams of the country. The diggers
of California have not, like those of Australia, to penetrate into
the earth for the drifts of the precious metal, but find them in the
strata immediately under the surface, either associated with the
subsoil or in the holes or ? pockets ?of water-worn rocks. They
rarely go lower than a few feet, and almost always close to the
margins of rivers or brooks, whereas at Ballarat and most of the
other prolific gold-fields of Australia, the gold is found on the pipe-
clay bottom of flat wide-spread plains, or settled in great subter-
ranean gutters deep under broad elongated slopes, which the
miner can only reach by sinking his shaft through stratum after
stratum, from fifty to three hundred feet down, before he reaches
tbe buried treasure. The inference necessarily is that much of the
gold-drift of Australia is of an earlier origin than the deposits of Ca-
lifornia, which are the products of the existing mountain-ranges,
and therefore will be exhausted in a comparatively brief period.
The auriferous drifts of the deep alluvial deposits may, and it
is probable will, be worked out in a comparatively short period.
Rich as they are frequently found to be, they must be necessarily
limited, having been deposited by currents and the continuous action
of waves not far from the localities where the gold was originally
formed. But the alluvial gold of Victoria and New South Wales
is not confined to drifts and ? guttersthere are hundreds,
probably thousands, of square miles where the clay, earth, and
sand are impregnated with gold in sufficient quantities to pay
well for washing. In one district of the Goulburn an area exists
of such an extent that it could not be washed over in half a cen-
tury. The Alma, Avoca, Dunolly, and Ararat districts are known
to be sufficiently auriferous to be well worth working under im-
proved processes. Mr. Hardy, formerly the gold commissioner
of the Turon gold-field, thus reports of its capabilities :
?ln the whole course of the Turon valley the production of gold
Yol. 107.? N0. 213. c appears


appears as regular as wheat in a sown field. It does not matter where
you work; any steady working man can earn ten shillings a day with
the utmost regularity. In short, from the top of the bank across the
whole bed of the river (from fifty to one hundred yards wide), and for
nine miles at least, the result is as absolutely to be depended on
as weekly wages, and 5000 workers would be nothing in that space.
There are, moreover, many partially explored, but highly promising
and almost illimitable territories, such as Gipps? Land and the
Wimmera, where there is every probability that the surface-washings
will not fall short in productiveness of the districts which have already
been found more or less remunerative.?
Although the rich deposits of the Australian gold-fields are
doubtless owing to the disintegration of pre-existing quartz veins
and decomposed rocks, more or less impregnated with the metal,
there are vast reserves , if we may so express it, of gold locked up
in the great mountain-ranges both of Victoria and New South
Wales, the hidden wealth of which can only be brought to light
by the skill and energy of the systematic miner. And this leads
us to the consideration of a question which at one time excited
considerable discussion ?the question whether gold-bearing quartz
veins can be profitably worked, or whether, by reason of their
asserted poverty at certain distances from the surface, every
attempt to pursue the metal in depth must be attended with loss.
The progress of mining both in Australia and California has
clearly proved that there exists no immutable law by reason of
which quartz-reefs are rendered richer near the surface and
poorer as they descend. The special correspondent of ?The
Times? in California, in a communication dated 10th April,
1858, thus expresses himself:??Quartz mining is no longer a
speculation, it is a certainty; and is destined to be the paramount
lasting interest of the country; and this improved success is
attributable to the greater depth of the sinkings. Great con-
fidence is entertained, much capital is laid out, and new build-
ings and improved machinery are always on the increase.? In
reference to Australia we shall quote a few examples of successful
deep quartz-mining for gold, which are certainly very remarkable
and calculated to give great confidence to the miners and
capitalists of Victoria.* The narratives are so extraordinary, that
we
* It must, however, be added, that as yet no mine has been sunk into the solid
rock of Australia, which a miner of Cornwall, South America, or Transylvania would
term otherwise than shallow. Again, at the depth of 200 or 300 feet, to which the
Victorian shafts have extended, no large lump or nugget of gold has been dis-
covered, the ore in the lower parts being finely disseminated in the quartz matrix.
The downward diminution in the size of the lumps of gold is, therefore, distinctly
opposed to the enthusiastic expectation of the colonists, that rivers of solid gold
will reward their deep sinkings. Those who desire to understand the main distinc-
tions


we should have hesitated to quote them had we not found the
general statements of the writer confirmed by concurrent and
independent testimony :
? A Mr. Ballersted, in the district of Sandhurst, attracted by the
richness of the surface, followed down his reef for 200 feet and found
no gold, but went down an additional 100 feet and found the reef
richer than at first, in one of the galleries of which he had the honour
of entertaining Sir Henry Barkly and suite at a champagne luncheon,
amidst the blaze of twelve hundred wax candles and the coruscations
of the gold-bespangled walls of the cavern. Mr. O?Farrall?s reef, on
Specimen Hill in Sailors? Gully, was only moderately rich at the top,
but kept improving as it went down. At a depth of 180 feet he gave
800 Z. for three yards of the claim to a partner who wished to sell out,
and the whole continued improving as he descended. At a depth of
250 feet the reef was 4 feet thick and more promising than ever.
During the sinking it frequently ran out, but was always recovered
again at a greater depth each time, proving better and better. It has
already led to the accumulation of a large fortune, and where it will
end neither science nor experience can conjecture.
?Johnston?s Reef, as it is called after the first person who opened
it, was worked by successive parties for upwards of two years, and
never showed a symptom of promise for 120 feet. After every one
else deserted it, a butcher named Dawborn organized a small party,
who set to work again: he supplied the funds from his trade earnings,
getting his wife to keep the shop; but after the shaft was down to
145 feet without finding a speck of gold, his resources became utterly
exhausted, and the spirit of the party was broken. It is the common
practice amongst quartz miners to finish up the day?s labour by firing
off the evening blasts just before leaving off, so that the work should
not be retarded in the morning by waiting for the smoke to clear
away, and, in accordance with this custom, Dawbom?s party, late of an
evening, fired their last blast as a sort of farewell to the claim that had
impoverished them all. Dawborn the same evening went to a public-
tions in Victoria (as in other countries) between the highly-remunerative auriferous
superficial drift, or accumulations of broken materials, and those old slaty rocks
(Lower' Silurian) which have been the chief original seat of the gold-veins, should
refer to the last edition of Murchison?s ? Siluria,? pp. 489 et seq., which is the great
authority on the subject. We there learn that, whilst Sir Roderick modifies one of
his earlier views, in which he inferred that the mining downwards in the solid
rock of Australia would probably turn out as profitless as it had already proved in
all other auriferous countries, he still affirms, from facts and experience, that gold
has not ? yet been found to expand downwards like copper and lead ; such a pheno-
menon being as yet unknown in any country.? The ideas of Sir Roderick on this
topic, as founded upon all the knowledge acquired previously to the discovery of
the gold-mines of Australia, are recorded in the ?Quarterly Review ? of 1850, vol.
Ixxxvii. p. 429, in the article ? Siberia and California,? in which he pointed out the
extent to which our own great Australian colonies were, in his opinion, destined to
become gold-bearing regions. For his still earlier allusion to this topic see his
Anniversary Address to the Royal Geographical Society, 1844; ?Transactions of
the Royal Geol. Soc. of Cornwall,? 1846 ; ?Journal of the Royal Institution,?
1849, &c.

house and strove hard to sell his fourth share for 15Z., but his proposi-
tion was received with derisive laughter. However, the next morning
having visited the reef for the purpose of gathering and carrying away
the tools, he went down the shaft to take a ? last fond look,? and was
well nigh overwhelmed by the gorgeous sight he encountered. The
first crushing of six tons yielded 370 ounces of gold, or about 1480 Z.
Since then the party have gone on amassing wealth rapidly, and the
share which they could not find a purchaser for at 15Z. would now sell
for 10,000 Z. In the next claim to Dawbom?s, on the same reef, a
twelfth share was foolishly disposed of for 500 Z., and reimbursed the
purchase-money in three small crushings.
? Wetherall?s Reef, likewise called after the person who first
?prospected? it, was perfectly barren for a great depth. Mr.
Wetherall was a gentleman by birth and also a University man, still
he worked as hard and as steadily as any Cornish miner, but was for a
long time very unlucky, being almost at the end of his tether before
any ray of hope came to cheer him in the prosecution of his daily
toil; however, when it did come it was in a full blaze, for in an
incredibly short space of time he took out gold to the value of 8000 Z.,
but got so unfortunately elated by this sudden acquisition that he
went to the Victoria Hotel in Sandhurst to celebrate his success, and,
in a fit of delirium, jumped from a window and broke his neck. This
poor fellow only began to find his gold when, in accordance with
scientific theory, it ought to have failed altogether.
? The Nelson Reef was paying well at a depth of 200 feet, and the
great Victoria Reef yielded the greater part of its almost fabulous
wealth at a lower level. The Clarence Reef was found by following
down a number of spurs or veins for 90 feet, at which level they all
met in the solid concentrated reef, yielding an average of 10 ounces
to the ton, thence downwards. The splendid New Chum Reef, from
which so many fortunes have been extracted, after paying in all places
at a high level and then becoming poorer, increased in richness again
as the deep sinking was persevered in. The great reef running into
Bendigo Flat gave no - ] decided proofs of richness until the sinkings
attained a depth far in excess of the scientific limit, and then one poor
fellow, in coming to his claim in the morning to examine the effects
of the previous evening?s blast, was so overpowered by the
spectacle which presented itself, that his senses lied on the instant,
and his insanity afterwards became so deplorably confirmed, that
the warden felt it his duty to employ a keeper to ensure his safe
custody.
� ln Tarrengower, a German named Weisenharem has a claim, from
which at a depth of 300 feet he took 4 cwt. of gold in the space of a
week. At Steiglitz the reefs are found to pay at great depths ; and at
Maryborough, Blackman s Reef paid well at 240 feet, and is improving
as it goes down ; one bucket of stone from Mr. Meredith?s claim having
yielded so much as 15 lbs. weight of gold at that depth.
* ? Life in Victoria.?


We could multiply proofs that the idea of reefs running out
as they descend, is now abundantly refuted by experience.
Trusting to the evidence of their senses, the merchants, bankers,
and professional men of the city of Sandhurst have expended
enormous sums in the erection of splendid shops, banks, and
edifices of a most enduring character, in the firm persuasion
that when the coal-seams of Newcastle are exhausted, fears may
be entertained of the continued productiveness of the gold quartz
reefs in their neighbourhood, and not till then.
Amongst the marvels of Australia are the sudden fortunes that
have been acquired by some of the poorest emigrants, who, enter-
ing the country with the stock in trade of only a few simple im-
plements, their brawny arms, and indomitable wills, have suddenly
stumbled upon wealth beyond their wildest dreams, and picked
up from almost the surface of the ground, in a few hours, riches
that would have more than rewarded a life of skilled and per-
severing labour at home. Children even have been known to
return to their homes tottering under a weight of gold of which they
knew not the value. The following instance of juvenile quartz-
mining is both amusing and suggestive :
� I remember,? says the narrator of the incident, ? one morning, after
our mill was at work, seeing two children loitering about the engine-
house with bags on their backs. At first I thought it was curiosity,
but observing that the elder made one or two efforts to engage my
attention, I inquired what he wanted, when, in a silent, cautious way,
the wily manikin asked leave to use a pestle and mortar that was kept
in the canvass workshop for testing quartz samples. I gave the child
permission, but instead of instantly availing himself of it, I remarked
that he and his comrade waited until the dinner-hour, when the
carpenter was sure to be absent; and even then they entered upon their
little business with a degree of wary circumspection that made me
exceedingly curious. So, after a short lapse of time, making a slight
circuit, I came noiselessly to the tent entrance, and found this pair of
Lilliputian miners laboriously at work, pounding quartz pebbles in
the mortar. My entry was a surprise ; but, when they peeped out, and
ascertained that none of the men were approaching, they became re-
assured, without, however, entering upon any explanation or confes-
sion, until I put the mortar on edge towards the light, and saw its
glittering contents. The elder child then told me, with reluctant can-
dour, that he and his mate, when at play the other day, found a ? little
quartz reef with a lot of gold in it, and without telling father and
mother, they picked out the two little bagfuls, and came round to the
mill by a back gully for fear any one should get upon the scent.? I
could not help smiling at their acuteness while commending their
prudence, and promised most faithfully to keep their secret, ?an obliga-
tion, however, from which they relieved me by keeping it to them-
selves. According to my estimate, the two parcels of stuff they had
with


with them would not have weighed together much over twenty pounds,
certainly not thirty pounds. It was very dark and disintegrated, with
little nodes of iron slightly interspersed throughout, but linked together
almost like so many rude necklaces, by ragged straps of shaggy gold,
which seemed as if it ran in a molten state through a layer of gravel,
which caught the particles in its embrace as it cooled. Anxious to ascer-
tain the result, I took the pestle and pounded the remainder in a short
time, and made them carry the produce up into my private tent, when,
to my astonishment, I found that it reached within a few pennyweights
of thirteen pounds of pure gold,?or within a fraction of the value re-
presented by 624 1. Think of such a sum in the hands of two little
ragged urchins, graduating amongst the wild gullies of Victoria, you
juvenile men of the world, who imbibe your knowledge together with
your partiality for cheroots and gold latch-keys at Eton or Harrow-
on-the-Hill! why, its subdivided moiety is as much as any individual
? governor ? puts upon the estimates as the privy-purse allowance of his
son and heir at either academy.
? The brace of millionaires smiled me their thanks for the service
I had rendered them, and departed with their treasure in a direction
which I very well knew, by their previous tactics, was not likely to
lead them to the neighbourhood from which they came ; and as if they
had become introduced to the surrounding scenery for the first time,
they sat down on every eminence to take a survey of the country
behind them. About ten days afterwards the same pair made their
appearance again, escorting a wheelbarrow driven by a lad more ad-
vanced in years, in which there was a good-sized, well-filled bag.
After entering the yard the trio squatted on the barrow, waiting, as
before, for the coming dinner-hour; but as I had, in the mean time,
been talking of the occurrence, the men determined to forego their
meal to see the result, and when the hour arrived, they made a ring
round the barrow, produced the pestle and mortar, and offered their
services in pounding the stuff. Seeing there was no averting the
result, the boys assented; but, on opening the bag to commence opera-
tions, there was a simultaneous start, as if all the gazers received
sharp electric shocks; and really it was a sight to produce a shock of
utter surprise, even to men accustomed to golden marvels, for the con-
tents were only comparable to large honeycombs of gold, dotted with
quartz and ironstone. Mr. S., a wealthy citizen of Sandhurst, who had
some of his own rich quartz under process at our mill at the time,
offered the lads a cheque for 1200 Z. for the contents of the barrow,
and he was a person both qualified to form a correct opinion of its
value, as well as constitutionally disposed to bid considerably below
the intrinsic worth of any article he desired to purchase. I did not
weigh the proceeds on this occasion, but even taking them at Mr. S.?s
estimate, it was a startling sum in the pockets of this juvenile trium-
virate. Every effort that coaxing, cajoling, or cross-questioning could
suggest was tried in order to discover the El Dorado without effect.
?I lost sight of the lads for some weeks, until one evening the
original pair turned up to make stringent terms for crushing seven
tons


tons of quartz. However, the stuff they got carted to the mill, far
from exhibiting any similar signs of richness, looked as if it would
not defray the cost of crushing?so much so, indeed, that the men
whose duty it was to throw it into the receiving hopper advised me to
demand payment before the conclusion of the process. On clearing
out the rubbish, as we supposed it, from under the stamp heads, we
found a quantity of coarse gold too large to go through the gratings,
and this, together with the finer portions contained in the amalgam,
weighed seventeen pounds some ounces. The result of this crushing made
me very slow afterwards in discarding quartz that was deficient in surface
indications, for not a single speck was seen throughout the entire heap,
though it was scrutinised with the closest care. In fact, had it been
mine, I would have preferred handing it over to the road contractor to
incurring the liability of 81. per ton for crushing; and I make no
doubt that, owing to similar deceptive appearances, thousands of tons
of highly auriferous quartz have been dispensed as road metal, and
now lie buried in the highways of Victoria, which, ?at least, in some
parts,?may most truly be described as ? paved with gold.? ? *
The inference to be drawn from the above facts is strengthened
by statements of unquestionable authenticity from other quarters.
In a letter from the Melbourne correspondent of ? The Times,?
dated May, 1859, is the following statement:
? The application of capital and costly machinery to the production
of gold, especially to quartz mining, is rapidly increasing, and some
very rich quartz reefs have been lately opened. At the Reedy Creek,
about twenty miles from Kilmore and about fifty from Melbourne, in
a rough hilly country, quartz reefs of a very rich character abound.
In some cases the yield has been as high as 31 ounces to the ton.
In some specimens that I have seen the gold was so minutely distri-
buted through the quartz as to be only here and there visible, yet the
weight of the specimens betrayed their richness, and they yielded
16 ounces to the ton. Last month the papers noticed a lump of
amalgamated gold weighing 730 ounces, as the largest yet produced,
but since then a lump of 1230 ounces has been produced from one
crushing. It was obtained from 45 tons of quartz taken from Iron
Bank Gully, at Bendigo. The labouring diggers now perceive that
the old mode of independent digging must in time wear out, and in
many cases they are becoming reconciled to working for wages.?
In consequence of the high price of labour three tons of quartz
at least are at present thrown away to one that is crushed. Quartz
that will not yield one ounce and a half to the ton, on an imper-
fect system of crushing and amalgamating, is abandoned for road
metal; ? nor is it any fable to say,? remarks a temporary resident
in the district, ? that many a fine and precious specimen has come
to light under the pulverising influences of the waggon-wheel,
especially on the line of road from Castlemaine to Sandhurst,

If mining in the veins of auriferous quartz should, as there is
every reason to believe, with an increased application of capital,
become generally and permanently productive, it would be in
vain to attempt to fix any limit to the quantity of gold capable of
being raised in Australia. The treasures opened to the world by
Cortez in Mexico and Pizarro in Peru become insignificant when
compared with the apparently inexhaustible riches of this vast
region, where a few years ago no gold was supposed to exist,
but which was heedlessly trodden upon daily by the wandering
shepherd, and even now probably lies scattered in profusion over
the slopes of mountains on which even the wild man had never
placed his restless foot, or has glittered unseen, for ages, on the
crests of rugged hills which only wait the keen search of civiliza-
tion and the skill of practical science to yield up their hoarded
wealth. The gold produce of Victoria is exhibited in the fol-
lowing Table, compiled from official returns:?

To show the change that has taken place in the method
of mining from the first rude process to the present scientific
system, we give, from official returns, the statistics of the
machinery employed in the gold-fields in the month of May,
1859 ; viz., 282 steam-engines, 4256 puddling machines, 135
quartz-crushing machines, 906 toms, sluices and dams, 508 whims
and whips, 66 horse machines, 200 water-wheels, 13 boring
machines, 1 smelting machine. We may add that so great has the
produce


produce of the quartz reefs become that it is estimated that 60
per cent, of the gold brought from the Bendigo district alone,
one of the oldest and most celebrated of the gold-fields, is at
present obtained from quartz taken from considerable depths.
The systematic character which gold-mining has assumed,
and the formation of numerous joint-stock undertakings for its
prosecution, have divested the pursuit of much of that excite-
ment and spirit of gambling which characterised the first ope-
rations in the gold-fields. Never probably in the history of
the world was a population thrown into so violent a state of
ebullition as in the first year or two of these remarkable dis-
coveries. The rush from one district to another, as fresh fields
were opened up, was extraordinary. Twenty thousand people,
earning high wages, or meeting with fair success, would rise
en masse in a day, abandon their claims, strike their tents, and
precipitate themselves, frenzied with the anticipation of sudden
wealth, upon the new tract, often to meet with the bitterest dis-
appointment. The passions of human nature were roused by
one of the strongest of its instincts ; and madness and suicide,
arising from excess of joy or wild despair, were far from uncommon
occurrences. Before we conclude the subject of gold-production,
we will quote two instances of enterprise, one resulting in great
success, the other in deplorable failure.
Two youthful Cornishmen went out, in humble capacities, on
the staff of the Colonial Gold-mining Company, but, the es-
tablishment having been reduced, they commenced an indepen-
dent career by taking out a claim on a portion of a quartz reef
that had been relinquished by their superiors. In their first
essay upon the stone they crushed as much as 30 lbs. weight of
gold from a single ton of quartz.
? Their candid admission,? says the witness of their good fortune,
? far exceeded all my previous ideas of auriferous quartz ; and when, at
their desire, in order to remove my scepticism, I raised the little
canvass apron in front of the stampers and took a handful of the
crushed stuff from the receptacle communicating with the amalga-
mator, it positively required an effort to lift it, so largely was the
pulverized quartz commingled with gold. I was invited into their
dwelling tent, which was as trim and tidy as a woman?s hands could
make it (for Mr. N. had another treasure besides his reef), and while
his hospitable wife was preparing luncheon, he amused himself by
exciting my amazement to its uttermost bounds, as he pulled cake
after cake of solid amalgamated gold, like so many Dutch cheeses,
from under his bed, until I absolutely thought either that I was
labouring under an optical illusion, or that he was practising a clever
trick, like that of pulling a market-cartful of cabbages out of a single
hat.


liat. However, it was neither the one nor the other, hut a palpable
reality, a marvellous fact, of the most stubborn description. As soon
as I got power of utterance I upbraided Mr. N. for his temerity in
keeping such an amount of treasure within the reach of any man
carrying a knife in his pocket, hut he seemed devoid of all appre-
hension, and I never heard of his having suffered by his excess of
confidence. He informed me that numerous other parties on the same
reef were taking out large fortunes likewise.?
Few, we think, will read without emotion the companion nar-
rative of a tragedy at the diggings :
� There was at a spot which was respected as sacred ground.
On Sundays and holidays people visited it, but there was an air of
mournful silent respect in their manner as if they conversed in sighs
within the precincts of a hallowed tomb. The oath of the reckless
digger was there never heard, and the finger of the thief never dared
to touch the various implements strewed around the grim windlass that
marked the scene of an unhappy emigrant?s fate. The party to which
it belonged came out together, schoolfellows, brother collegians, all
of them with gentle blood in their veins. They had a moderate joint-
stock of capital at landing in the country, which they carried direct
to the diggings to escape the allurements of city life. They were
remarked wherever they went to work as most temperate and indus-
trious in their habits, acquiring esteem and popularity from their kind
and obliging dispositions. But they w r ere not favourites of fortune ;
they always came down on a barren bottom, and their neighbours at
length came to remark on their ill-luck and to sympathize in their
adversity. Their capital, under the strictest economy, quickly
dwindled away, but they were too proud to admit their poverty or ask
for credit, so when their money failed they disposed of their little
trinkets and jewellery to lucky diggers in order to procure the merest
necessaries, never in their sorest trials evincing the slightest gloom or
impatience ; even when the last locket, emptied of its sacred contents,
was transferred to the rugged bosom of an unwashed purchaser to
enable them to carry out their last experiment, they went to work
with all their wonted cheerfulness and serenity. On, on they worked;
down, down they went, with a steady rapidity as if assured of success ;
and one day as the evening hour was approaching, a cry, a tone as of
exultation, came up from the bottom of the shaft, ? Haul up, my boys;
the time is come at last!? and his mates did haul away with gladsome
hearts?the more heartily from the great weight coming up. But
alas ! alas ! when it came to the surface, instead of a bucket of gold it
was the dead body of their dear companion. He had struck the barren
bottom during his spell below, and detaching the bucket, he fixed a
noose round his neck and was strangled by his dearest friends. Never
was there so large or sorrowing party at the diggings; and ere the
next sun arose the remainder of the party had departed, no one knew
whither. Had they remained, and could have been prevailed upon to
accept


accept it, a thousand pounds in gold- dust would have been collected
in an hour to start them afresh, for they possessed troops of friends
and not a single ill-wisher.? *
The social changes wrought by the gold discoveries of Aus-
tralia were more sudden and remarkable, probably, than any
other country has ever been exposed to. The whole order of
society was inverted, and the labourer became of more importance
than the employer of labour. Life became a wild orgy in the
intervals of a toil more exciting even than dissipation. The
immense immigration utterly ? swamped ? the old residents, many
of whom fled, terror stricken, at the aspect which society had
suddenly assumed, and their establishments were broken up
by the social convulsion. The scum of the adjoining colonies
boiled over and deluged the land with vice and crime. Bush-
ranging extended over every portion of the country, and robbery,
not unfrequently murder, was perpetrated in the streets of Mel-
bourne. The diggers were of all nations?Germans, French,
Italians, Chinese, American-Irish, and, worse than all, Califor-
nians, who imported their peculiar institutions as well as their
manners to complete the horrible pandemonium. No surprise
could have been felt when an emeute broke out which required
military repression. The best conducted, and, notwithstanding
certain grave faults, the best disposed portion of this mixed popu-
lation were the Chinese, who amounted, at a recent date, to
50,000. Notwithstanding some restrictive measures forced upon
the Legislature to check the influx, the temptations of gold-digging
and high wages are irresistible; the number is increasing; and
one of these people, when asked how many more of his coun-
trymen might be expected in Australia, said, ? They are all coming.?
There is, unfortunately, a great antipathy to them in the gold-
fields, and assaults and maltreatment are frequent. At Ballarat
a newspaper in Chinese was established in May, 1856, and in the
same year a Joss-house was erected in Melbourne. There are
several wealthy Chinese merchants in the capital, who have large
transactions with their countrymen on the different gold-fields.
Few women accompany them, but they are said to succeed
in obtaining wives among the Irish. It is to the Chinese that
the greatest of all the recent gold discoveries is due. The
immigration-tax drove them to a surreptitious mode of entering
the colony; and landing in Gurchen Bay, in South Australia,
and taking a course thence over the frontier across the Gram-
pian ranges, they came upon a deposit of marvellous richness
* ? Life in Victoria.?


in the neighbourhood of Mount Ararat. In one of their first
encampments, while picking up the roots of grass and prying
for gold, they found the celebrated ? Chinaman?s hole,? which
yielded 3000 ounces in a few hours. This led to the greatest
? rush ? which had ever been known at the gold-fields, for 60,000
people congregated there in a few weeks, and before a month
had elapsed an immense town was systematically laid out, and
shops, hotels, and restaurants arose, like the mystic trees of
Indian jugglers ; these were quickly followed by theatres, billiard
and bagatelle rooms, a daily mail and a daily newspaper. Thus,
within the space of two months, a wild mountain gorge was
converted into a teeming city, where frontages were nearly as
valuable as in the heart of London. It is believed that the
golden ? lead ? is traceable all the way from Ararat to Avoca, a
distance of sixty miles, through a country flanked by auriferous
ranges.
It is doubtful whether, but for the previous discoveries and the
excitement consequent on the great success in California, the
treasures of Australia might not have been still unrevealed, and
the gold have remained unknown for centuries to come. Count
Strzelecki, in his important work, the ? Physical Description of
Australia,? merely notices the existence of an auriferous pyrites
of no commercial value, though he previously alluded to the
existence of gold in a letter which bears the date of 1839. The
Rev. W. B. Clarke detected gold when crossing the dividing
range to the westward of Paramatta, In 1844 he addressed
Governor Sir George Gipps on the subject, but without any
result. The matter was regarded only as one of curiosity,
and systematic search was discouraged from an apprehension of
the effect which any important discovery might have on the
convict population.* But there is reason to believe that gold
had been discovered at Forest Creek long before it was found in
any other part of the colony. It is said, on good authority,
to have been seen by a Mr. Campbell on the bank of a
stream where his sheep were being washed. At the first glance,
like Lieutenant Tucker in Hobson?s Bay in 1804, he imagined
it was mica , but on closer inspection he found it was pure scaly
gold, lying under a thin covering of sand. Astounded at the
discovery, he revealed it to his uncle, a great flockmaster in
the district, but, fearing the total desertion of his people and the
consequent ruin of his fortune, he enjoined the strictest secrecy.
Neither Count Strzelecki nor Mr. Clarke had printed a word upon
* 1 Further Papers on the Discovery of Gold in Australia, 1855.?


the subject when Sir Roderick Murchison put forth his grand
generalization. Without any other guidance than his own saga-
cious deductions from geological facts, this eminent geologist
boldly predicted the truth. In 1846, a year before even the Cali-
fornian discoveries, when addressing the Royal Geological Society
of Cornwall, he strongly recommended the unemployed Cornish
miners to emigrate to New South Wales and dig for gold in the
debris and drift of what he called the Australian Cordillera, where
he anticipated, from their similarity with the Ural Mountains, that
it would certainly be found in abundance. The visions revealed
to the prophetic eye of science have never received a more
remarkable fulfilment.
The facts which we have adduced in reference to the gold
production of Australia appear to us to establish the proposi-
tions : ?l. That it presents a boundless field for industry, and for
a period to which it is impossible to assign a limit, 2. That
the quartz reefs are likely to be the sources of an enormous
gold production, and that this branch of enterprise will be
steadily pursued, subject to the fluctuation attending all mining,
but offering prizes of the most splendid kind.
The great social disorganization which distinguished the first
few years of the Australian gold discoveries has completely passed
away, together with much of the excitement that was natural to
a transition state. Order now universally prevails, and the occu-
pations of life are pursued with as much regularity as in the
oldest states. Nor have we any apprehension that the monetary
transactions of the world will be seriously disturbed by the pro-
bable large increase of the precious metal. As in all the other
gifts of Providence, the time of the great discovery has doubtless
been determined with the highest wisdom and with an exact
appreciation of its influence upon the progress and happiness of
the world. An astonishing impetus has already been given to
commerce and industry; competence and wealth have been
diffused over many lands; and from the local chaos, inevitable
from so great a revolution, order and virtue are being rapidly
educed. A vast continent, long regarded only as a convict prison
and an abode of one of the lowest forms of savage life, has been
elevated into a social consideration almost commensurate with its
geographical importance, and has become a seat of industry, pro-
gressive refinement, freedom, and Christianity.
The improving agriculture, sheep-farming, commercial progress,
and political institutions of Australia would each require a special
article for their complete discussion. It is difficult to realize the
fact that in 1835 the first acre was fenced in and sown with
wheat


wheat in Victoria. The spot is now the site of a vast foundry in
the city of Melbourne, vomiting smoke by day and by night,
and turning out daily tons of implements for economising
agricultural labour or for extracting the mineral riches of the
soil. According to the statistical returns, prepared in March,
1858, the quantity of land under crop in the province amounted
to 237,729 acres, and the produce of the harvest of that
year was as follows: Wheat, 1,808,438 bushels; maize,
<5,558 bushels; oats, 1,249,800 bushels; potatoes, 51,115 tons;
while 401 acres were planted as vineyards, which yielded 5,761
gallons of wine and supplied the markets with 318,463 lbs.
of grapes. Pre-eminent as Victoria is for its mineral wealth, it is
scarcely less remarkable for its corn-producing qualities in com-
parison with those of several other countries. The following
table, extracted from the ? Australasian Handbook,? showing the
average produce per acre, speaks for itself:?

acres in wheat alone, from which were obtained last year, not-
withstanding its low average of productiveness, 2,250,000 bushels,
from which 30,000 tons of flour were exported, chiefly to Victoria,
which requires about 42,000 tons annually from external sources.
The flour of Adelaide secures for South Australia a greater share
of Victorian gold dust than any other natural production.
The production of wine is making great progress in many
parts of Australia. In 1857 there were 1128 acres of land in
New South Wales converted into vineyards, and the native wine
in the same year amounted to 108,174 gallons, and the brandy
to 1414 gallons. The province of South Australia, however,
appears to be the best adapted for the cultivation of the grape.
Some of the wines of that district which were sent to the Paris
Exhibition were pronounced by the Judges superior to any
sample shown of Rhenish wine, and a demand for them has
already arisen in the English market; but the wines on which
the greatest hopes are founded have, it is said, more the character
of the Spanish than the French or German. They are now
produced to a considerable extent for consumption in the colony,
and are displacing second-class foreign wines in Australia. A
great stimulus was given to agriculture by the enormous prices
paid for all descriptions of farm produce on the first irruption of
the digger population, when hay brought 50/. per ton, potatoes 25/.,
cabbages brought 2s. 6c/. each, cauliflowers 55., a couple of fowls
305., eggs 18s. a dozen, and a turkey 21. 10s. or 3/.* But all pro-
duce has now found its level. The competition in agriculture
rather tends to the unnatural depression of prices than their en-
hancement, and it seems to be the general opinion that farming
on a large scale will not pay at present. Gold and wool are, and
must long continue to be, the great staples of the country.
The production of wool next to gold will be the great per-
manent source of wealth to these colonies, and tends even more


rapidly than gold to increase the area brought under the do-
minion of civilization. Stock rather more than doubles itself in
two years and a quarter, so that at the end of that period it
occupies double the space of territory, at the end of four years
four times, at the end of six years eight times, at the end of eight
years sixteen times, and thus at the end of ten years thirty-two
times the space originally taken up. There is something sublime
in this steady and regular, yet peaceful and almost unconscious
spread of civilised man, with his flocks and herds, over the wilder-
ness which he appropriates to his use.
?At his advance,? says one who has himself observed the process,
? the indolent aborigine retires with spear and boomerang into the far
bush, even as the tawny dog had led the way, oft pausing with back-
ward stare at the white-faced intruder, ?preceded himself by the more
timid kangaroo, with high uplifted ears, as he passes, in long-arched
bounds, towards the security of the mallee scrub; while the black swan
rises vertically, and dashes over head with retreating trumpet-cry to seek
his loneliest swamps. Before his footsteps the savage desert of sand, of
stones, or marsh, or bog, of grim forest, of rank luxuriance, or of choiring
weed, becomes a station and a farm, a homestead, a smiling pasture,
where order reigns, and where the unbroken silence which once menaced
the imagination of the lost man with famine, and fever, and delirious
death, now only suggests the tranquillity of peace and plenty. Where
the gaudy-painted parrots or flocks of snow-white cockatoos flew by
with discordant and insulting screech, the domestic canary now sings
in his cage of Chinese cane-work, and the native magpie on the
fence warbles with upturned eyes, presenting an equal mixture of
the ludicrous and devout, or addresses you familiarly in broken
English. On the brow of the hill, so recently the scrubby haunt of the
dull and diminutive native bear, or the mild-eyed opossum?in the
bed of the valley, last year, perhaps, a rushy marsh, only diversified
by patches of coarse and cutting kangaroo grass, or a mournful lagoon,
?whether on the sunny slope or the sunny level?there we find the
absolute and incontrovertible result of labour well directed. Before
the footsteps of man the torrent ceases, or turns aside to fertilise in-
stead of to frustrate ; the swollen river of winter is made passable with
safety to men and cattle at all seasons; and on its winding banks, a
few years ago so utterly destitute, where the platypus basked in the
water-grass and rushes at sun rise, and the fabulous bunyep was be-
lieved to wallow at night with appalling gasps beneath the moon, ?
in those despairing solitudes new townships arise, and already aspire
to municipal institutions.? *

The demand for shepherds is necessarily continually on the
increase, and as it is an employment which commands a fair remu-
neration, it is rather eagerly sought. It has one peculiar advantage
?that of being suited to almost any man of respectable character.
The wages of this class of persons have risen considerably since
the gold discoveries. There have been emigrants who aspired
to be at once flockmasters instead of shepherds, with very little
knowledge of what they were about to undertake. A ?spi-
rited ? young gentleman, a short time ago, arrived at Sydney with
a large capital, and a desk full of introductions. At the end of
a month of fetes and dissipation he bought 10,000 sheep, but
when he had paid for them he found that he had forgotten to
secure a run, and was obliged to re-sell them immediately at an
enormous sacrifice to escape being utterly ruined. Many men of
good education and refined tastes, who had no capital to lose,
fascinated at first by the attractions of the gold-fields, but disap-
pointed in their hopes, or unable to bear up against the exhausting
toil, have taken to ? the bush/ and found competence and peace
of mind as veritable shepherds,?the fevered life of a gold-digger
being succeeded by the repose of the silent plains! Life in
these vast unpeopled solitudes has in it, for many, an inexpres-
sible charm. The shepherd rises just before the sun, and after
making a breakfast that would be a substantial dinner to an
agricultural labourer he follows the sheep all day, just keeping
them in sight, letting them wander wherever they please except
into the thick scrub; at noon he directs them towards water,
where they camp or lie still in the shade. As evening closes in
he turns his flock homewards, and arrives at his hut just as the
sun is sinking below the horizon. If he has a hutkeeper, or an
assistant, his work is done for the day, and he may attend to the
little garden which he has fenced in from the wilderness, or
prepare the evening meal. If the dogs are good, no special
attendance is required before midnight, when a watchman takes
his seat in a box beside the sheep. We have heard of a young
Oxford undergraduate, who, under the pressure of family diffi-
culties, struck out his own path to independence, and now has the
management of 3000 sheep in one of the remotest stations of
Australia. He kills and cooks his own mutton, saves nearly the
whole of his salary, and lives in plenty and content. The love
of literature, which he has carried with him from the University,
cheers his days and nights, and an occasional newspaper, and
the regular packet of letters from home, are read by the light of
a tallow lamp with a zest that only a ? gentle shepherd ? in the
Australian wilds can know. Many of the great grazier lords of
\ 01. 107. ? N0. 213. D Australia,


Australia, the owners of seventy or a hundred square miles of
pasture, and the proprietors of hundreds of horses, thousands of
bullocks, and tens of thousands of sheep, lived formerly in a
state almost as barbarous as civilised man could sink to ?
? Ancient Britons,? as was once said of them, ?in everything but
paint? There are now many squatter families of superior educa-
tion, who, emulous of the old country, have their orchards, planta-
tions, and ornamental gardens, and are setting a good example to
such of the shepherd lords as remain in their bachelor condition,
and consequently retain many of those uncivilised habits which a
long residence in the bush is too apt to engender.
In tracing the progress of Australia it is impossible not to
notice the services of a class of men to whom the colonies are
much indebted for the rapidity of their advancement. We refer
to the overlanders, or speculators, as we may define them, in stock
on an enormous scale, the magnitude of whose operations was
at one time so great that whole fortunes were staked in the wilder-
ness. The occupation of these persons, who were generally in the
prime of life, and often of the highest education, Etonians and
University men, was to convey large flocks of sheep and herds of
cattle from the interior to the coast, and to find out practicable
routes from districts capable of supplying stock at a cheap rate.
The attractions of this life are said to have been irresistible for
certain characters. It combined the excitement of gambling
with the love of adventure. Twenty thousand pounds have been
known to be embarked in sheep, cattle, and horses, and driven
for months over a trackless country with a precarious subsistence
and uncertain supplies of water, on a journey, as it may be termed,
of discovery, and amidst wastes almost as inhospitable as the
ocean. But the port to which the adventure was directed
once reached, its success was assured, as well as the prosperity
of the station; mercantile enterprise was immediately stimu-
lated, abundant supplies of stock were obtained on favourable
terms, and the unknown pioneer who entered the district
a leader of large flocks and herds, was hailed as a public
benefactor. The rough-looking stranger generally underwen
a speedy transformation. Having disposed of his stock and
realised a profit of perhaps a hundred per cent., he resumed the
habiliments of social life, public entertainments were got up in
his honour, he was cordially welcomed in the ? first society,? and
the manners of the sturdy drover were often found to be as
polished as if he had just arrived from the precincts of May
Fair. But settled life had few charms for him. New plans
were quickly formed, new enterprises matured; and, after a
few


few weeks of enjoyment or ennui , he plunged again into the
wilderness.* The overlander still exists, but the area of his opera-
tions is becoming gradually more contracted ; and although it may
be long before roads or railroads will completely traverse the great
interior, communications with distant stations are now opened
with comparative facility wherever a remunerative market is to
be found.
The absence of large navigable rivers was for a long period
thought to offer an insuperable impediment to the progress of
Australia. A great portion of its interior is a treeless desert
of sand-swamps and jungle, where streams are converted, in
summer, into stagnant pools by the rapid evaporation. In the
province of Victoria, however, this absence of water communica-
tion, which must have made the settlement of the greater portion of
its territory a very slow process, has, by a beneficent arrange-
ment of Providence, been rapidly and completely opened up,
throughout its whole extent, to the industry of man. The want
of rivers has been compensated by the presence of goldi Popu-
lation has spread over the province, and railways traversing
the length and breadth of the land are beginning abundantly to
supply the means of transport. The Government of Victoria
has not found the smallest difficulty in raising eight millions
sterling in the London market for the construction of its iron
roads, and the confidence of the mother country in the sound-
ness of the security is manifested by the high premium which
it bears. But Australia possesses several magnificent streams
that are now beginning to assume important functions in the
commerce of the country. The Darling is a noble river, and
the Goulburn and the Murray are navigable at the same period
of the year. Phus the traders ol South Australia are now able to
transport their goods for a distance of upwards of two thousand
miles by water, discharging their cargoes and securing return
freights of wool at the very threshold of the north-eastern gold
fields of Victoria.
South Australia is, as we before observed, par excellence the
agricultural district. Of gold it can show but small returns ;
but it possesses other mineral resources of the most important
character. The Burra Burra Mines in their extraordinary richness
are equivalent to gold, and history can furnish no parallel to their
productiveness. In a late number of the ? Adelaide Advertiser ?
it is said, ?Hundreds of miles in the northern districts abound in
copper of great purity?in fact, it only requires the proper adjust-

the overlanders and their habits.

merit of capital to labour, and the application of both in due
proportion to this colony, to result in the opening of half-a-dozen
Burra Burras. Our copper mines are practically exhaustless;
were our population increased tenfold, and were capital supplied
in proportion, all might find remunerative occupation in raising
the vast accumulations of copper, which nature with lavish hand
has buried beneath the soil in almost every part of this land.?
Of the whole continent of Australia not more than one-fourth
is, as yet, known; but that the interior contains many a fertile
oasis and rivers sufficient for the purposes of a civilised people is
not to be doubted. In the course of the recent exploring expe-
dition undertaken from Adelaide, under the direction of Captain
Stuart, a new country was found of a natural fertility and richness
unsurpassed by any in Australia ; and its extent was so great
that Captain Stuart was obliged to return without having ascer-
tained its limits, for none were visible from the furthest point
that he was able to reach. The settled districts now occupy
as large a space "on the globe as Great Britain, Ireland, and
France; with a climate quite as healthful and genial as that of
the latter. There is every reason to believe that the climate of
the colonised portion of Australia has of late years undergone a
sensible amelioration. The annual mean temperature may re-
main the same, or with only a slight variation, but the distressing
hot winds and dust blasts are becoming, from year to year, less
frequent, inasmuch as the sand hills and deserts, at least in the
neighbourhood of the towns, which were one of the sources of the
evil, are now under cultivation or have been built upon, and are
traversed by hard metalled roads. In Victoria there are three
separate districts with strongly marked atmospheric distinctions,
Gipps Land, warmed by the breezes of the Pacific, shielded
from the hot desert winds by a boundary of highlands, and from
the chill polar winds by the opposite Tasmanian Mountains, pos-
sesses almost a tropical vegetation; but the northern districts
are said more to resemble Andalusia, Naples, or Greece; and
the southern and western are more peculiarly adapted for the
harvests of central France and of Britain. Australia, in truth, is
capable of the growth of most of the finest productions of the
globe. ? If,? says the ? Melbourne Herald,? ? oranges and lemons
will not flourish in Victoria, they will in New South Wales; if
pine-apples, bananas, and cocoa-nuts cannot well be grown in the
neighbourhood of Sydney, the three Australian colonies can be
amply supplied from Moreton Bay; and similar advantages of
exchange exist with regard to many other valuable products of
nature.?
It is pleasing to find the people of Victoria, notwithstanding
the


the absorbing' character of their pursuits, keenly alive to the
attractions of nature, and intent upon the pictorial, no less than
the material progress of their country. We presume a writer
in the ? Argus ? gives expression to a common sentiment on
this subject. ?Nothing,?he says, ?can be uglier than most of
our colonial trees, so ragged in form and monotonous both as
regards the character and colour of the foliage ; but if we substi-
tute for it the numerous varieties which are capable of flourishing
here, the whole aspect of the country would undergo a transfor-
mation. We should combine the vivid verdure of England Avith
the luxuriant vegetation of southern latitudes, and a land as fair
as Italy would bask beneath a sky as blue and a climate more
benign. The progress of the seasons would be more distinctly
marked, and new charms would be conferred on each. Spring
Avould clothe our forests Avith a tender green ; summer expand
their foliage, so as to convert the woodland coverts into cool
umbrageous shelters from the heat; and autumn, ? laying a fiery
finger on the leaves,? would impart to the landscape a richness of
colour with which our eyes are unfamiliar here. The chesnut-tree
Avould strew the ground with snow, shed from its pyramidal
blossoms; and the elm, as in the days of Virgil, afford support to
and receive a new grace from the clinging vine; autumnal paths
would be aromatic with the odour of fallen beech and walnut
leaves ; and art would derive fresh inspiration, nature a periodical
renovation, and British literature a new meaning, when Ave had
surrounded ourselves with the forest trees which communicate so
much both of grandeur and loveliness to the face of England.?
The exploration of the interior of Australia has not yet made
much progress. The numerous expeditions penetrated as far as
their means permitted, but they are now known to have been
utterly inadequate. The horse will probably in future be super-
seded by the camel, and parties will be able to pass through the
central regions with fewer difficulties to surmount than heretofore.
A passage across the interior once established, roads, tramroads,
and ultimately railroads will follow, and a grand trunk line will
doubtless at no very distant day connect the southern with the
northern coasts, and open the whole of the great unknown territory
to our investigation.
One of the most unsatisfactory features in Australia is the
excessive commercial speculation of which it is the field. In the
early period of the gold discoveries such a spirit was inevitable
and uncontrollable. No representations would have been suffi-
cient to counteract the expectations of extravagant gains that
Avould attend the first exportations to the land of gold. Enormous
profits were made, but they were followed by enormous losses;
and


and even now when a normal state of commercial intercourse
may be considered as established between England and Aus-
tralia, there is, it is to be feared, much reckless speculation
and miscalculated adventure. The remark applies equally to
commercial firms in Australia and in England. Over-trading in
and to Australia appears to be an inveterate evil. We suppose
no country in the world could show such a balance sheet of insol-
vency as the one which we append for the province of Victoria,*
and we regret to observe that time does not appear to have
mitigated the evil. But there is a character of which the
legitimate Australian trader has good reason to complain, namely,
the exporting British manufacturer, who is justly regarded, in
the colony, as a commercial nuisance. The goods sent out
are generally less suited to the market than those selected by
the regular impoi'ter, or by his partner or agent at home; and
when the consigning manufacturer, as is too often the case,
breaks down, his ruin is of course attributed to ? a failure of re-
mittances from the colony.? The Australian banks have, to a
certain extent, the power of checking the spirit of speculation
in the colony, and we believe they exercise their discretion with
great intelligence, and a firmness becoming their high position
and character; but the incautious or unprincipled speculator at

home


home is comparatively uncontrolled, and, unfortunately, he has it
in his power not only to ruin himself, but to baffle the most
careful calculations of others.
Malte-d�run, in his great geographical work, notices as a re-
markable fact, that in 1816 the city of Sydney possessed a bank
with a paid-up capital of 20,000/. There are now in Australia
nine banks, Colonial and British, with a paid-up capital of
5,898,835/. The most singular feature presented by the bank
returns of the province of Victoria is the enormous proportion
which the deposits bear to the number of inhabitants, being
12/. 16s. 3d. per head for the whole population. Several of these
banks are now paying dividends at the rate of twenty per
cent, per annum ; one or two, for a short time, paid dividends of
forty per cent, per annum, and reimbursed their original capital
to the ? fortunate shareholders ? in three years. But those were
the days in which the gold-digger was, as a favour, offered 21.
per ounce for his ? dust ? at the gold-fields or at the bank counter,
and which was, a few months after, sold in Threadneedle-street
at the standard price. But the times have changed, and the
successful digger is now importuned to accept 2s. per ounce
above the standard price. How, it may be asked, can the banks
do this and yet pay handsome dividends ? It is believed they
find it their interest to buy up all the gold at a price beyond its
intrinsic value in order to prevent the merchants from making
their home remittances in bullion, and thus compel them to pur-
chase drafts at such a rate of exchange as the banks, by a mutual
understanding, think proper to fix.
There is another unfavourable feature in Australian society
to which we must briefly advert. It has its strikes and combi-
nations. Agitation for objects both impracticable and unjust
has found support from large masses ol the people, ? Class
legislation? is a cant term too often heard in England, and is
generally applied with as much ignorance as injustice ; but can
any legislation be more intrinsically unjust than a law for the
support of self-imposed idleness, and for the prohibition of further
immigration ? 4 Monopoly ?is another term of reproach in the
mouths of some popular leaders at home; but we have never
heard any denunciation of a monopoly of labour. In Melbourne
a fierce outcry was raised against the Chinese immigration, and a
combination was formed for reducing the hours of labour to eight
hours, on a pretence that the exhausting nature of the climate
rendered it detrimental to work for a longer time. Having
obtained this object, the workmen soon discarded the hollow
pretext by proposing to labour extra hours for extra payment.
The presumption and injustice of the movement reached its
height


height when a demand was made on the Colonial Legislature by
the labouring classes for a law prohibiting all further grants of
public money for immigration purposes, lest their brethren, the
struggling paupers and unemployed artizans of England, should
swarm over to the land of promise, and put an end to the extra-
vagant profits which the colonists were resolved not to surrender
without a struggle. We hear that an agitation has again been
recently set on foot in Victoria, the ?cry? of which is??Eight
hours? work, eight hours? sleep, and eight hours? play! ?
In consequence of the enormous immigration occasioned by the
attractiveness of the gold-fields, there is for the present rather a
redundancy than a deficiency of labour in the Australian colonies,
although the construction of railways will doubtless absorb much
of the surplus; and the rapid development of every description
oi industry precludes the supposition that any disproportion
between labour and the means of employing it can be other than
a very transient state of things.
New South Wales was governed from 1828 until 1842 by a
i epresentative of the Crown, aided by a nominated Legislative
Council. In the year 1842 the Legislative Council was increased
by the addition of elected members to the extent of two-thirds of
the whole. In 1850 the province of Victoria was separated from
New South Wales, and Lord Grey introduced some slight
changes in the constitution of the latter, chiefly by giving to the
Legislature a greater control over the civil list, and power to alter
their own Constitution, if they thought proper, by the establishment
of an Upper House, either elective or nominated. South Australia
has passed through much the same constitutional phases as New
South Wales and Victoria. Western Australia is governed by a
nominated Legislative Council, The history of this colony is one
of a settlement long struggling for a bare existence. It did not
possess sufficient capital to make available its natural resources,
which were inconsiderable, and it had a scanty population.
In 1850 immigration almost ceased, and the colony existed
upon the Imperial expenditure and a very limited commerce.
Under these unfavourable circumstances the settlers, as the
only probable mode of emerging from their difficulties, peti-
tioned the Home Government to make the colony a penal settle-
ment. The request was granted; and since that period the
colony has progressed, exports have increased, and the farmers
obtain a ready market for their stock and produce. Although
this improvement has chiefly arisen from the introduction of
convicts, the statistics of crime show a remarkable absence of
offences against the peace and good order of society. The new
colony of Queensland, or the Moreton Bay district, is just com-
mencing


mencing- its independent career, and starts with the fairest
prospect of future wealth and importance. In this portion of
Australia Great Britain possesses a colony that stands in the
same relation to her cotton, that her colonies in the south
d� to her wool, manufacture. It is a country most favourably
situated for the growth of almost every description of tropical
produce, besides having in its southern territory some fine
sheep-pastux-es, and its great resources will doubtless be speedily
developed.
In the Constitution conferred by the Imperial Legislature on
Victoria was included a power for enlarging its basis, if desired.
Mr, Haines, the Prime Minister in 1857, accordingly intro-
duced and carried through the Legislature a reform bill, the
essence of which was manhood suffrage. The new law placed
1 GO, OOO names on the roll?an enormous number, certainly, in
a population of 512,000 souls, showing a very large number
ol adult males in proportion to the whole people. Property
qualification was at the same time abolished, but no person
can be registered as a voter unless he can read and write.
Elections are conducted by ballot. The Legislative Assembly
originates all money-bills. The Assembly may ,be prorogued or
dissolved by the Governor, but twelve months cannot intervene
between the last day of one session and the first day of the next.
-The mass of the people in Victoria are ardent politicians, but
the return in consideration and influence is not, we presume,
yet sufficiently great to make a seat in the Legislature an object
of supreme ambition to the successful merchant or extensive land-
holder, Candidates are not always to be found by constituencies,
and some Members have been treated with extraordinary liberality,
and received marks of extravagant appreciation. A Mr. Cameron
was elected Member for the Ovens in 1855. The electors sub-
scribed the qualification then required, in an hour, and had his
horse shod with shoes of solid gold when he rode, in procession, to
attend the official declaration of the poll.
That the governments which the liberality of the mother country
has conferred upon these most promising and important depen-
dencies will escape the evils inseparable from all human institu-
tions cannot be reasonably supposed. There are questions even
now unhappily open which may set class against class, interest
against interest, man against man, and throw the colonies into
confusion, unless they should be dealt with in a spirit of perfect
fairness and liberality. Lhe problem, how to manage the great
national estate which has been made over to the country, with
justice to all parties having usufructuary or proprietary rights,
is yet to be solved; and the questions to which it gives rise
constitute,


constitute, at the present time, the basis of almost all the politi-
cal combinations that have been formed in the different pro-
vinces, Much, and, we fear, irreconcileable, difference of opinion
exists as to the mode in which the land question shall be
dealt with; and until that is settled, both the surface and the
depths of society will be more or less agitated. If we can
believe the local organs of public opinion, opposition in the Legis-
lature is already often carried beyond the bounds of fairness and
moderation. ? The opposition lose no opportunity of* imparting
into the debates of the . Assembly the most extraneous and irri-
tating topics.? 4 lf the opposition finds itself in sufficient force
at the opening of Parliament a vote of no confidence will be tried.
The succeeding Ministry will be at first welcomed, then tolerated,
then worried, and then defeated.? Lhe result has been that there
have been four Administrations in less than three years, and the
one just formed is likely to be as ephemeral as its predecessors.
New South Wales is not less excited and divided in its politics.
4 Amid the discordant opinions and confused clamour of a general
election,? writes an able correspondent from Sydney, 4 it is impos-
sible to foresee what sort of land-law will pass it is even
doubtful whether any will be passed, and whether public opinion
is yet sufficiently matured, and whether any possible Ministiy
can propose any bill that shall enlist the support of a majority
in both Houses,? * In South Australia party spirit appears to
have been carried to extremes almost incompatible with the
existence of government: ?
? The principle of ministerial responsibility,? (we quote from the
4 Handbook for Australasia?), 4 for the first time introduced into the con-
stitution, led to the overthrow of three successive Administrations at a
comparatively early period of the Session. At the inauguration of
the New Constitution the old occupants of the Treasury Benches
retained their seats and their offices, with Mr. B. T. Finnis as Premier.
Early in August the Finnis Ministry were compelled to retire, having
been defeated on almost every question of importance during their
career as responsible ministers. His Excellency then sent for Mr.
John Baker, a member of the Legislative Council, who associated
with himself Messrs. Gwynne, Bagot, Hart, Blyth, and Milne. Mr.
Baker?s Ministry was sworn in on the 21st of August. On the 25th
of August the New Ministry first appeared as such before the Legis-
and were met, within an hour of taking their seats, by a no-
confidence notice of motion, tabled by Mr. Torrens, the Treasurer in
the preceding Government. The hostile motion came on the very
next day, and was carried by a majority of seventeen. Within twenty-
four hours the Baker Ministry was at an end, and Mr. Torrens, the
mover of the fatal resolution, was empowered to form an Administra-
* Letter from ?The Times? correspondent, Sydney, June 14.


tion. On the Ist of September Mr. Torrens? New Government was
sworn in; Mr. Torrens made a more successful dehut than did Mr.
Baker, but he mismanaged his position, and was overthrown in a
motion by Mr. Hanson, affirming that Mr. Torrens? Government, by
repealing certain regulations affecting Crown lands by proclamation,
instead of by enactment, had acted in an illegal and unwarrantable
manner. The assailed Ministers made a desperate defence, and their
overthrow was only effected by a majority of three votes. ?
The succeeding Cabinet is said to possess the elements of
stability. It is impossible to read the local organs of opinion
without perceiving that Australia has a crisis to go through
which will severely test her principles and her patriotism. But,
living in a huge glass-house ourselves, we are not in a position
to throw stones at our kindred beyond the seas; and we are
bound to admit that the late working of our own constitutional
government does not present the bright example that we could
desire for the imitation of our political offspring.
What is to be the future of this great country, which, from
its size, may be justly termed the fifth continent of the earth?
A century of active colonization cannot develope its resources
to their fullest extent. Yet there can be no such dense popula-
tions concentrated in Australia as are found in the more civilized
states of Europe, or as may be found at some distant day in
America. The quality of a large proportion of the soil com-
pletely settles this point; yet tracts of inexhaustible fertility and
enormous extent are known, and others will doubtless be speedily
discovered. It possesses all the requisites for the highest indus-
trial development. Its coal is abundant and accessible; its har-
bours are numerous, and many of them unsurpassed by any in
the world. Who then shall venture to fix a limit to the pro-
gress of a people with such vast resources, in a continual course
of augmentation from the great Anglo-Saxon hive of commerce
and industry, engaged in pursuits capable of an almost un-
limited expansion, presenting the greatest possible attractions
and crowned with the highest success? And if the material
grandeur of Australia is, as we believe it to be, certain, it would
be treason to our race to doubt that the political and the moral
will be worthy of the economical future. The best feeling
exists on the part of the people of these magnificent colonies
towards the land of their fathers, and the government under
whose protection they have grown up to political manhood.
Their attachment to England has been recently exhibited in
the most gratifying manner. The munificent contributions from
the Australian Provinces to the Crimean Fund proved that they
were as profoundly interested in the events and consequences of
the war as any inhabitant of the British Isles; and on a more
recent


recent and affecting occasion they were second to none in their
manifestations of sympathy and in the liberality of their re-
mittances. ? I cannot,? wrote the Governor of South Australia
in transmitting the contribution of the colony to the Indian
Relief Fund, 4 conclude without expressing the personal pleasure
I derive from being made the medium of communicating this
further proof of that loyal attachment to the British Empire
which emphatically and honourably distinguishes South Australia.
In no colony is the general sympathy of the community more
instantly awakened by events which touch the honour or welfare
of the mother country, and the handsome contribution now
transmitted springs from the same feeling which had previously
stirred the hearts of Her Majesty?s subjects here to assert, by
their resolutions and subscriptions, their inalienable birthright
to be associated, even from this distance, in the glories and
sufferings of British soldiers.? Similar and equally gratifying
communications were received from the capitals of Victoria and
New South Wales. But as relates to the great question of the
future it would be impossible to use more impressive language
than that of the late Secretary for the Colonies, Sir Edward
Bulwer Lytton, in a speech, worthy of himself and of the subject,
delivered on the occasion of the last celebration, in London, of the
foundation of the Australian colonies. 4 You, gentlemen of Aus-
tralia,? said the brilliant orator, 4 took with you from this country
no bitter or angry resolutions, no associations of the reigns of the
Stuarts, but, on the contrary, you carried with you the feelings of
affection for a free country and for a benignant Queen, and the
tie has been all the stronger because it has been more gently felt.
The time may come when these new colonies of ours will be
great states and nations?when they will find it easier to raise
armies among them than they now find it to raise a police ?
when, instead of that single armed steamer for which the colony
of Victoria now so nobly pays, she will have in her harbours
forests of masts, and in her waters a navy of her own. It may so
happen at that distant day that England may be in danger. It
may so happen that the great powers of Old Europe may then
rise up against the venerable parent of many commonwealths. If
that day should arrive, I believe that her children will not be
unmindful of the tie which binds them to the dear mother-country,
and that to her rescue across the wide ocean vessels will come
thick and fast, among which there will be heard but one voice?
-44 While Australia lasts, England shall not perish.? ?
While the connexion subsists (and may it long subsist!) be-
tween the mother-country and the great communities which she
has founded, the British flag will wave over the rich argosies that
* float


float the golden treasures of a richer Mexico to the commercial
emporium of the world; and the whole power of Great Britain
will be pledged for the protection of the country. But Eng-
land cannot expect to retain for ever as dependencies colonies
that have grown into populous, rich, and self-supporting com-
monwealths. Whenever the importance, the dignity, or the interests
of the communities to which she has given birth shall demand a
nominal as well as a substantial independence, it will be con-
ceded, we doubt not, without hesitation; and whatever form the
new governments which may then be established shall assume, we
are persuaded they will present some of the best characteristics
of the British Constitution. We can only trust that the great
interests of Australia will then have become so identified with
each other that its political amalgamation will be solid, enduring,
and complete ; and that the mighty continent may never be aptly
symbolized by the great composite image which the King of
Babylon saw in his troubled dreams?the head of gold repre-
senting its riches and its splendour, but the legs of iron and
toes of clay, strength enfeebled by want of coherence, and power
separated into democratic fragments by the violence of faction.

SOUTH LANCASHIRE exhibits one of the most remark-
able illustrations of the force of industrial energy to be met
with in the history of the world. But a few centuries since, the
district was little better than a howling wilderness. The army of
the Conqueror could with difficulty penetrate its dense forests or
struggle across its destructive morasses. The few inhabitants
who contrived to subsist in it, retired to the wild and inaccessible
country, now teeming with population, situated near the sources
of
