THE CHARLES CAMPBELL CLAN.
In the graveyard of the Presbyterian Church in Dalrymple, Ayr,
Scotland, is inscribed upon one of the many old tombstones :
"To the memory of Hugh Campbell, late farmer in Knochjarder,
who died 1st November, 1837 in the 58th year of his age*
And his wife Agnes Murdoch who died 29th October, I860,
aged 81 years."
Inscribed upon the same tombstone :
"Henry Campbell, farmer Causeway, second son of Hugh Campbell
who died on his passage to Australia on 26th June, 1861 in his
52nd year of his age".
In the Churchyard at Dalrymple are several tombstones inscribed
to The Campbells but on many, the inscriptions are not legible.
It is not known if there is any direct connection with the
following inscribed marble tablet, attached to the wall of the Bath
Abbey, which reads as follows :
"Near this marble are deposited the remains of Hugh Campbell Esqr.
of Mayfield, Country of Ayr, North Britain.
Late Captain in His Majesty's 85th Regiment. He died in this
City 5th January, 1824 1773) aged 51. years".
There followed upon this marble tablet a long sentimental inscription.
There is no record of any connection between these two "records in
stone", but there could be. The following is an attempted historical
record of the descendants of Hugh Campbell and Agnes Murdoch. They
are the oldest recorded ancestors of the Charles Campbell Clan. The
records are often drawn from vague traditional stories and from what
has been passed along by word of mouth from one family generation to
another.
Hugh Campbell, farmer of Knochjarder, was born 1781 and died
1st November, 1837 in his 56th year. He married Agnes Murdoch bom
1779 and who died 29th October, i860 aged 81 years. This couple had
five sons :
(1) John of Lon Milton, had two sons.
(2) Henry who had 13 children.
(3) Charles who married and migrated to Canada, was a Minister of
the Church which he later abandoned to form his own Sect called


The Campbellites, last contacted in Montreal in 190?-
(4) William who married twice, had three daughters. His last
wife was Mary Donald, sister of Henry's wife Jane, buried in
Roma Cemetery.
(5) Hugh of Tarcross, never married.
William and Mary migrated to Australia evidently did well in
business. In the early 1880's they owned Wallumbilla and Blythdale
Stations. R.oma Downs was then part of Blythdale Station and called
"Damper G-ully". They had two sons, Hugh and David. The latter son
settled in Toowoomba and had two sons, Harold and Alfred and five
daughters -one Ann, married John McNeill, Peta married Sydney Baynes.
Before departing their Native Land, this clan owned or leased
several farms, namely, Causeway, Balgreen and Barbiston near Skeldon
on the River Doone.
Henry and Jane Donald inherited the Causeway farm near Dalrymple
and are to be the principal couple of this history. Their descendants
left the better records for this branch of this big clan to be
followed with reasonable accuracy.
Henry was the second son of Hugh and Agnes Murdoch and was born
1809 on Causeway farm. He died aged 52 years and was buried at sea
on 26th June, 1861 while taking his family to Australia.
Henry married Jane Donald. She was born in 1812 and died in 18/0
at Cobrum Station at the age of 64 years. Her grave is marked by an
engraved granite slab in Yfangaratta Cemetery. Jane was a daughter
of Robert Donald, flour miller, Cahool near Dalrymple, Scotland. Her
sister Mary Donald married Henry's brother Y/illiam.
Henry and Jane had a family of 13 children, all except one
living to ripe ages, rearing large families. Davida, the fiftn
daughter and the ninth child, died by accident in childhood. Ann
the oldest child, married W. Turpin of London where they reared 2 sons,
Charles and Henry. They had one daughter, Jane. The other remaining
11 children all migrated to Australia.
Hugh and R.obert, the two oldest sons, migrated first in 18j>7»
They were evidently not very successful in the G-old Rushes, so
undertook farming, acquiring Stockyard Hill some 10 miles from
Beaufort, where they were sufficiently successful with their prospects
of life to induce their parents to bring out the family to join them.




Henry and Jane with their 9 children, sailed in the "Prince
Consort", but suffered severe damage in the Bay of Biscay, so had to
return to Plymouth for repairs. Upon the second attempt the good
ship again suffered damage so returned to Liverpool, There the
passengers were placed on board the S.S. "King of Algiers", but that
ship was damaged in the Bay of Biscay, causing it to return to
Portsmouth for repairs. Upon the fourth attempt, they sailed into
Melbourne after ten monthd effort.
Upon their arrival in Melbourne, the son Hugh, met them and took
them by bullock team and drays to his farm Stockyard Hill near
Beaufort.
Jane Campbell (Henry 1 s widow) purchased Causeway Farm near
Beaufort, where the family carried on mixed agricultural farming
and dairying, growing potatoes, carrots, grain as well as dairying.
The widespread gold mining industry had attracted a large
population in those districts, thus providing a ready market for all
foodstuffs. Large towns were established at Beaufort 10 miles away
and larger towns at Ballarat and Ararat, each some 30 miles off.
Farm prices were good, wheat worth about 5/~ per bushell milled at
Ballarat. Oats were worth 3/- to 5/“ per bushell. Cheese was from
6 to 9 pence per pound and butter about l/- per pound. The
unmarried members of the family operated the farm with "Mother"
Campbell the boss. As the sons reached 21 years of age, the family
would co-operate to finance them into their own station or farm.
Most properties were in those days, operated by family labour and
owned by family partnerships. That form of co-operation prevailed
through many generations of the Clan Campbell.
Having a school near the Causeway Farm was a great help to the
Campbells who could thus get some schooling and work their farm.
Mr. Skews was about the last teacher to educate the family. He lived
to a ripe old age in Melbourne.
Most farming in those days was not only largely a family
occupation, but work was done with hand tools and single mole
board ploughs. Ploughing half an acre per day was normal.


The oldest son, Hugh, born 1835, having done well with his farm
Stockyard Hill, married a daughter of Captain John Campbell (no
relation). In 1872 he entered a partnership with his father-in-law
to buy Cobrum Station from Ewan Macpherson. Prior to this transaction
that Station had been "stuck-up" by the notorious bushranger Morgan.
Hugh later took into partnership his Mother and youngest brother
Charles, they having sold Causeway Farm near Beaufort.
Cobrum Station, on the Murray River in Victoria, had an area of
84,000 acres, evidently held under Occupation Licence. It ran
30,000 sheep.
Mrs. Jane Campbell died at Cobrum on 16th October, 1876 at
64 years. She is buried there with a large block of granite marking
this last resting place of this very remarkable head of a large
pioneering family.
Upon his Mother's death Charles became Hugh's partner, but soon
afterwards, due to the prospects of the Station being resumed under a
new Land Act, they sold for what Hugh had paid for it namely <£25,000.
The buyer was John Webster of Melbourne.
Soon after this sale in 1878, Charles joined his two brothers,
Henry and John, in the purchase of Ensay Station in North G-ippsland,
Victoria, carrying some 24,000 sheep with 3,000 cattle. Included
in this purchase was a "snow" lease in the Bogong High Plains 60 miles
away.
Being the single partner, Charles assumed the responsibility of
droving the cattle from Ensay to the snow lease, to graze the cattle
from about November after the snow had melted and produced good
pastures. After supervising them there in the unfenced country with
a staff of two youths and a camp cook, they would drove the cattle
back to Ensay about March for the winter.
In 1878 due to a slump in the sheep market, Charles took 4,000
cast for age ewes from Ensay to the snow lease, shepherding them
there for the summer. To market these ewes as fats, Charles had to
make his way to the Mitta Mitta River over the high "Razor Back" on
Mount Feathertop, the first sheep to be taken that route across those
rough steep mountains without river crossings nor roads. Upon
reaching the Mitta Mitta River, they followed that river down to


YJangaratta, where they were sold for 3/6 per head to a hr. Andrews of
the Riverina in New South hales.
is the western Australian G-overnment was advertising unoccupied
land at nominal rentals, Charles and his nephew Peter Smith (same age, 1
took the P. .O.Ship "Assam" to Albany in 1879. From Albany they
caught the weekly ship to Fremantle.
Nestem Australia, being a Crown Colony, had a large number of
convicts. The curfew was apiplied at 9 p.m. in all towns end cities.
After the curfew, no convicts were allowed out of their houses or
barracks. People wandering after that hour were challenged by the law,
demanding an answer whether they were "Bond or Free"ll Convicts
had to use the pavements and "Free" people used the middle of the
roads. People who were leaving the Colony had to purchase a permit
for 1/-.
Upon enquiry for new or unoccupied lands available, the Lands
Office in Perth advised Charles and Peter that there were good
reports of land being explored in the Fitzroy River district, but
nothing could be done until the explorers’ reports had come to Perth
and that could be a wait up to 2 years. This uncertainty was most
unsatisfactory to the enquirers. They caught the S.S. "Rob Roy" at
Fremantle for G-eraldton.
In G-eraldton Charles produced his letter of introduction to the
local storekeeper who was also a local Councillor. Nr. CharO.es
Crowther advised the enquirers that he had repossessed a new Station
called "Beringarra" from two brothers named Butcher of Victoria who
had selected Beringarra some 2 years earlier and had failed to meet
their debts to him. Crowther offered this station to Charles and
Peter for £4,000 with 3,000 sheep on its 1,000 square miles. It was
330 miles inland from Geraldton, that port being 300 miles north of
Perth.
To finance this purchase, Charles produced his Letter of Credit
upon the Ensay Station for £l,OOO. An appeal to the other members
of the Clan, his brother Robert who had not too much success in
Victoria, raised £l,OOO credit from his brother-in-law John Murray of
Ballarat who was married to his sister Agnes. Peter’s father, James
Smith, married to Charles' sister Jessie, raised £9BO. Thus £2,900


was paid Mr. Crowther who evidently gave time to pay the balance from
profits.
With the conclusion of this successful transaction, Robert
brought his wife with their nine (9) children, along with James and
Jessie Smith, to take possession of Beringarra and to take up
residence. The venture was evidently quite successful. Their wool
usually sold for 22 pence.
They built homesteads,out-buildings and woolshed by making mud
bricks dried in the sun. Buildings were thatched with grass. Good
underground water was found at about 20 feet for both domestic
purposes and for the sheep. They ingeniously constructed the means for
scouring the wool. They constructed a wool press, using spades and
crow-bars for same. The scouring was done by six gins. Peter Smith,
with 2 drays, carted the wool to G-eraldton for shipment to London
for sale, quite a long time being transported for sale. The sheep
were shepherded in three flocks, each flock by 3 convicts who later
were replaced by friendly Myall Natives. The flocks had to be
counted regularly and if any sheep were unaccounted for, action was
taken. Usually the shepherds had eaten some that they should not
have done, or wild Myalls had raided the flocks and made off to the
bush. Being the farthermost inland station at that time, the natives
were quite wild, so it took time to establish contact. Thus, all the
Europeans were always armed. Besides inducing friendly native
families to shepherd the sheep flocks, younger ones were engaged to
act with each European as trackers and contacts with the wild ones.
Men were broken into shear the sheep. The first shearing was done
by the partners who later taught the natives. Charles claimed he
was the first European to shear 100 sheep in one day, doing up to
112 one day.
Being officially advised that they lived beyond Police protection,
they awarded punishment to any offending native. They were usually
chained to an overhead log, like on a gallows post, one end of the
chain firmly pinned upon the top of the log, the other end locked
around the culprit's wrist fixed with a split link. Sentences upon
"the chain" were made for periods according to the degree of the
crime!'.


The "boys" attached to each European were wonderful trackers.
They could identify every human being most accurately by their foot-
prints. When following a party of wild Myall sheep raiders, they
could follow their tracks over most country at a canter, upon their
horses. The "boys" were always loyal to their boss and unsympathetic
towards their wild mates.
One winter, John Campbell visited his brothers and sister. At
the end of his inspection, he and Charles decided to inspect the
40,000 acre block of land near Sharks Bay that was included in the
purchase of Beringarra. It was a 250 mile trip to it. After 4 days
in their dray with two horses, the country became so unimpressive and
so unattractive for grazing that they gave up and returned without
the inspection. The country was mostly unexplored.
In 1882 the partners sold Beringarra to Mr. Darlott for £12,000
and divided that capital according to the capital each contributed.
Ilobert and his family took over the 40,000 acre block at Sharks Bay as
their part of the sale of Beringarra. Robert and family took up
permanent residence in Western Australia, developing and owning many
stations.
Charles and the Smith family rejoined their partners at Ensay
Station in Gippsland, but soon after his return Charles accepted the
£4,000 portion of the Beringarra sale as his interest in Ensay, so
he went looking for his own station later in 1882.
The first station Charles inspected was "Molly" Station 20 miles
down the Namoi River from Narrabri. He then inspected Coolah Station
near Barraba. While staying with his brother Hugh at Glenalvon Station
near Murrurundi N.S.W., he inspected and bought Yarraman 60 miles
distant on the Liverpool Plains. He also bought Turee Vale Station
some 24 miles away across the mountains, James Seive sold both
stations to Charles and partners. Yarraman consisted of 9,000 acres
freehold, carrying 4,000 sheep, 500 bullocks and 200 cows, price being
£24,000.
Turee Vale was 30,000 acres of leasehold, unstocked, price being
£6,000. The terms for the purchase of the £30,000 venture were £B,OOO
cash, balance payable 4 years at Gfo, Yet another Campbell family
partnership was formed in acquiring Yarraman and Turee Vale. The
partners’ shares were Hugh being responsible for £lO,OOO, Charles for
£13,400 and nephew Peter Smith for £6,600.


By 1885 the two stations were running 20,000 sheep, but those
numbers were reduced the following year by drought, to about one half.
In 1887 Peter Smith, with a new partner named Sharp, purchased
Turee Vale from the partnership for £13*500 with 10,000 sheep. Peter
sold his interest in Yarraman for £2,500 as part payment. Sharp
paid £2,500 cash, thus together contributing £5,000 toward the
purchase of Turee Vale, the balance of £8,500 being payable over 4
years at By 1891 Yarraman was sold to Busby Bros, for £25,000.
In 1893 Charles had to repossess Turee Vale because of drought
%
and bad debts.
In 1885 Hugh, having sold Olenalvon, purchased Belaringar
between Nevertire and Nyngan on the 'western railway, it was of
100,000 acres. In 1889 Hugh and Charles jointly purchased the
adjoining station, Mullengudgery, from the Mackay family, consisting
of 26,000 acres with 15,000 sheep for £26,000. The terms of the
purchase were £lO,OOO cash, balance payable over 3 years at 65..
Charles took up residence at Mullengudgery, the homestead being
situated close to the railway line, which traversed the whole area.
This convenience to transport was ideal for producing and marketing
fat lambs.
Several years of drought, plus heavy interest burdens, caused
Charles much trouble and tribulation. Financial difficulties from
Turee Vale greatly embarrassed financial equilibrium of Mullengudgery.
By late 1902 sheep numbers had been reduced over the series of
drought years from over 20,000 to only 1,200 sheep, which in 1902
were sold at auction in Wellington for 3/- per head. When Charles
had to sell this residue of his flock he decided to abandon
Mullengudgery to the mortgagees and decided to depart New South Wales.
In 1885 Charles, on 19th November, married Sarah Ann Eliza
Occleston, the eldest daughter of M r . T.J.Occleston and Eliza, nee
Johnston, importers and merchants of Melbourne. The histories of the
Occleston and the Johnston families will be recorded separately.
Eliza Johnston was the second daughter of Charles Johnston of
Annandale.
In April, 1903 Charles departed from Bourke for Queensland with
his two oldest sons, Colin 16 years and Hugh 14 years, to establish
a new home for himself and his family. They travelled to Queensland


in a wagonette with horses, the 200 miles to ¥alien his new home,
north of Cunnamulla situated upon the west side of the Warrego River.
His wife, with their two daughters, Jessie and Helena aged 11 and 5
years with their youngest son Alan aged 8 years, after visiting her
father in Melbourne, travelled by railway to Wallangarra, Toowoomba
and arriving at Coongoola and Wallen on Ist August, 1903*
By 1901 the financial situation of Mullengudgery became quite
desperate. Charles’ nephew Jack (son of Hugh) advised him of a
station called "Andglen" situated 60 miles east of Cunnamulla being
for sale. It was owned by Jack’s father-in-law, Mr. J. Ryrie, who
had died and the estate was unable to hold these grazing farm leases,
hence they were for sale.
Charles travelled the 260 miles to inspect Andglen of 4 grazing
farms totalling some 80,000 acres divided into 3 paddocks, carrying
3,000 sheep. He returned to Dubbo and negotiated the purchase with the
Ryrie Estate for the sum of £4,000, terms £l,OOO cash, balance payable
over 4 years. Charles had accumulated the necessary £1 ,000 by having
earned fees for buying fat stock for his friend Ben Richards of
Riverstone Meat Works. He earned fees for valuing lands and
selections. He placed these earnings into the bank account in his
wife’s name. Thus his first purchase in Queensland. Management of
Andglen was continued by Fred Easy and his family for the 4 years that
Charles owned the station. Easy and family were highly competent
managers. They were connected with the Hugh Campbell family at
Beleringar for many years.
Charles sold Andglen after 4 successful years to Messrs. Burgess
and Bond of Hobart, Tasmania, for the handsome profit of £B,OOO.
After Charles had abandoned Mullengudgery, he negotiated
employment with the manager of The Australian Morgage and Agency
Company M r . B.B.Allen. That Company later changed its name to
Australian Mercantile Land & Finance Company. Mr. Allen advised
Charles that his Company had been forced to repossess Wallen Station,
40 miles north of Cunnamulla from M r . White and offered Charles the
management of Wallen as well as the job of taking possession. Mr.
TsThite was in the same position that many other graziers found them-
selves namely, in a bankrupt financial situation due to many drought
years and bad livestock prices.


Mr. White was very distressed when Charles arrived to take
possession, so Charles assumed the responsibility of allowing White a
period of grace to visit Brisbane to try to secure relieving finance
to save his station. He was not successful, so Charles had to act.
As the Land Laws do not permit a company to hold any grazing farm
lease for more than one year, the Australian Mortgage and Agency
Company offered Wallen to Charles. It consisted of 75,000 acres with
6,000 sheep. There were few buyers at that time in the country for
property. Charles negotiated the purchase of Wallen with its four
grazing farms and stock for taking over the debt of £9,400 and to
produce a guarantee for £3,000. The debt was to be paid over 5 years
at 6;', interest*
John Murray of Ballarat, married to Charles’ sister Agnes,
agreed to act as guarantor. Thus he acquired Wallen as his new home
in Queensland in April, 1903, where he and his family prospered, the
station still being owned by the Clan to this day, mid 1974.
By 1906 Charles had sold Andglen to advantage. He cleared all
debt contracts in New South Wales and liquidated all debts in
Queensland. To celebrate his success, he sailed in 1907 with his
wife, touring the world for the year. They established contact with
relatives in England and in Canada upon their return via that route,
they contacted a cousin in Montreal who was religious, named Charles
Campbell, who established his own sect The Campbellites.
While in Vancouver, Charles having surplus travelling funds in
hand, was impressed by the prosperity of that city. He purchased
two town allotments for £5OO. After holding these allotments for
two years, he sold them for £1,300. They were overseas from January
1907.
While his parents were touring the world, Colin was at 21 years
of age, Manager of Wallen with his Aunt Charlotte Occleston responsible
for the family. The young Colin was so successful in his management
that the next year, 1908, Charles, true to the Campbell tradition,
valued his estate and gave Colin his share of it. That came to
£3,000 plus a guarantee of £2,000 to venture out alone.
Colin selected two grazing farms 25 miles south of Charleville
and 5 miles from Wallal Siding. The area of this land was 38,000
acres, quite undeveloped and with little natural water. Colin called


his new station ''Colombo" v/hich was the name of the Parish. He
proceeded to develop this land very competently. He had to sub-divide
with fences. He sank an artesian bore to about 2,000 feet, getting
about half a million gallons flow daily distributed by about 30 miles
of bore drains. Later the land had to be enclosed by a dingo-proof
fence. He built a woolshed, yards and quarters as well as a new
homestead with necessary buildings. Thus a large project was well
planned and executed by the youthful Colin. It was stocked with
some 6,000 sheep.
When his second son Hugh, attained his 21st birthday in 1909,
Charles presented him with his share of the family estate, amounting
to £4,000 with which he purchased "Roto" a grazing farm of some
25,000 acres with a homestead, buildings, yards etc. and good water.
V/ith the purchase were 500 cattle which Hugh sold to Peter Smith in
1911 to stock his rev/ station Brigalow on the Paroo River. Roto was
30 miles north west of Wallen.
About this time, 1909, Harry Campbell, eldest son of John
Campbell, visited Wallen in search of a station. He had £4,000 to
invest, given him by his father who was Charles’ brother. After
inspecting several station properties, Harry bought Mt. Alfred, 50 miles
west from Yfyandr a, comprising two pastoral leases aggregating some
120,000 acres running 4,000 sheep and for which he paid £5,000. Harry
soon decided to sell the place, so Charles bought it.
In 1911 Charles, who had given Colin a one-fifth interest in
Mt. Alfred, decided to sell it, stocked with 11,000 sheep and 700 cattle
Colin was the supervisor and the Easy family managed. John Campbell’s
second son Charles, who had been given £4,000 by his father, purchased
in 1911 one half share of Mt. Alfred for £6,000 and took over manage-
ment. Charles had married a lady doctor. Colin received £4OO for
his fifth share.
By 1913 the stock on Mt. Alfred were reduced to 1,800 sheep and
200 cattle due to drought, dingoes and to mismanagement. Young
Charles retired from the property and his father assumed his
responsibilities to carry on the partnership.
In 1911 the brothers Charles and John advanced their nephew,
Peter Smith, £3,000 v/ith which to select two grazing farms of 42,000
acres west of the Paroo River and adjoining Mt. Alfred. He developed


this land which he named "Brigalow". He built his own home where
he brought his family. He stocked it with 500 cattle purchased from
Hugh Campbell.
Upon the retirement of young Charles and the formation of a new
partnership in Mt. Alfred in 1913/14, they sold the remaining sheep
because of the increase of the dingo menace and stocked up wholly
with cattle. Soon after these actions, they decided to enlarge the
partnership by admitting Peter Smith, making Peter manager and
running the two stations jointly. Later the partnership selected
another grazing farm adjoining called Spring Creek or G-oogawaddi of
45,000 acres.
Although World War 1 saw good prices for cattle, the partnership
was not successful. The dreadful slump in livestock following the
War brought financial affairs to a climax. John Campbell had died and
his estate was not prepared to invest more capital to restore the
partnership interests and Peter Smith had no more capital available.
The partners decided to auction the aggregation with some 5,000
cattle, plant and horses. As cattle had no value, some were being
offered to anybody who would muster them and take them off some
stations. There was no interest in buying the Ht. Alfred aggregation
when it was auctioned.
Charles’ youngest son Alan successfully negotiated the purchase
from the partnership. He gave £l,lOO to his father and that sum to
the John Campbell Estate, thus £2,200 cash,and assumed the responsibil-
ity for the debt of some £5,000* Peter Smith’s equity had, very
sadly, quite disappeared. His personal liabilities and his share of
the liabilities of the partnership were tragic happenings for elderly
folk at the end of their lives in the bush.
To this period the Campbell family and Peter Smith ventures had
only experienced unhappy financial results over the period of 12
years to 1921. The consistent loss of capital without income must
have been very heart-breaking for Peter Smith who had expended much
time and energy developing those rough lands on the Paroo Liver.
But it was common fate for many graziers.
We must return to the events of the Charles Campbell family as
at 1912 when many radical changes took place. Hugh had sold koto


to negotiate purchase of one half interest from his brother Colin
in Colombo and he assumed management of that station successfully.
Colin negotiated the purchase of half interest in fallen from his
father and took over the management which he carried on till his
death in 1964*
In 1913 Charles visited the Iloma district, attracted by its
higher altitude of near to double to that of Cunnamulla at 600 feet.
The higher rainfall average of 23 inches at Roma was another
attraction against the Cunnamulla average of some 12 inches per year.
There is much attractive land around Roma, much being freehold title
with heavy carrying capacity.
After inspecting some stations handy to Roma, Charles finally
purchased that well known established and heavily developed station
"Merino Downs" comprising 10,000 acres freehold with 5,000 cheep.
He took delivery November, 1913 paying £24 >OOO. lie engaged as
manager his nephew, son of his youngest sister Isabella Porteous, who
kept house for Malcolm.
In 1914 Charles, his wife and two daughters took up residence at
Merino Downs. His daughters Jessie and Helena played important parts
in the management of the property for years. Charles formed a limited
liability company to hold Merino Downs. Most of the shares were
allocated to his wife and daughters, he retaining a minimum number,
but in the Articles of Association, he retained control for his life-
time by being permanently appointed Chairman of Directors with power
to fix his own salary.
In 1920 Charles left the management of Merino Downs to his youngest
son, Alan, who had just returned from nearly 5 years of active service
in the Middle East. He made his headquarters at Merino Downs with
his parents and sisters.
In 1922 Helena was married to Hugh, eldest son of Andrew Scott,
part owner of the old family station "Hornet Bank" on the Dawson River
near Taroom. After a couple of years living at Hornet Bank, Hugh
negotiated purchase of half interest in Colombo from Colin, where
they reared 4 children.
In May, 1927 Charles took his wife and her sister, Charlotte
Occleston to England. They toured the United Kingdom, returning on
the S.S.- Ulysses, via the Cape, Singapore and Java.


In 1928 Alan negotiated the purchase on behalf of Charles
Campbell & Sons Pty.Ltd., of the adjoining property called Cooinda,
comprising 8,500 acres of freehold at £2-10-0 per acre unstocked.
Alan then purchased 5,000 cast for age ewes from the finest flock
in the Maranoa "V/eribone" near Surat.
The shareholding of Charles Campbell & Sons Pty.Ltd. was
34,000 £1 shares paid to 13/4 each. Charles allocated to his wife
12,000 shares and to each daughter 10,000 each. To each of his
three sons were allocated 100 and he retained 1,700 for himself.
In 1929 Alan, having sold his pastoral interests on the Paroo
PJLver and on the Warrego, purchased the well known property Dalmally
adjoining Merino Downs. It was of 13,500 acres freehold and cost
£2-10-0 per acre with 6,000 selected ewes, plant and horses. As the
land blocks were interwoven, Dalmally with Merino Downs, a new
partnership was formed called A.E.J.Campbell, Helena May Scott and
A.J.Campbell. Each sister owned one quarter and Alan one half of this
partnership which owned the livestock and plant. It rented the
land from each member of the family who owned it. This partnership
prevailed until it was dissolved in 195°.
After buying Dalmally with its 23 room house, Alan invited his
parents and sister Jessie to share his new home, leaving Merino Downs
as an outstation.
This partnership ran usually about 25,000 sheep with from 500 to
I, cattle and horses.
Charles, born 10/3/1858 died at Dalmally on 4th July, 1933 and
was buried in the family plot in the Iloma Cemetery. Charles took an
active part in public life. In New South \ ales he was chairman of the
Cannonbah Stock Board, was a member of the District Licensing Court
at Nyngan. When he lived at Wallen he was many years a member of the
Paroo Shire Council and Chairman for a term. He was an early
Director of the Queensland Primary Producers’ Co-operative Association,
Brisbane until his death. Soon after tailing up his domicile in
Queensland, he with his friends Frank Rutledge and W. Crowhets, formed
the Grazing Farmers and Settlers Association, engaging the Hon.
J. as Secretary. It later merged with the Pastoralist
Union to form the United Graziers Association of Queensland.
Sarah Annie Eliza Campbell was born at Melbourne 12/3/1858.


Died 25th July, 1934 in Roma.
Her married life had not been easy, rearing a family of live
under the primative conditions and discomforts of living in the "back-
blocks'' at the close of the last century.
After her "first born" Colin arrived into this world at Quirindi,
his Mother had to choose her transport bet ween an unsprung cart or
horse-back. She chose the latter and in those days, no woman rode a
horse other than in a "side saddle", awkward and precarious. So baby
Colin crossed the Blue Mountains for home at Yarraman Station, lying
upon a cushion on his Mother's lap on a side-saddle on a horse.
That is but one instance of the courage and resource demanded
of those pioneer women in the Outback in those far away days.
.
They had to attend illness on the spot in their old fo,shioned
manner. Broken limbs had to be set by the Mothers and local women
in a manner often attracting compliments from the few doctors in
those remote regions.
Those pioneer women ruled their considerable households in a
manner that could not be taken lightly. Their responsibilities
demanded competence.
Stores and materials had usually to be calculated upon six or
even twelve monthly orders and deliveries.
The usual "open house" hospitality to travellers of those days
added to the housewife*s anxieties and responsibilities.
Entertainment was usually a burden carried by the "woman of the
house". One of several parties who were entertained by Charles and
Annie Campbell, was about the time of Federation when they were
requested by the Government of New South Wales to entertain in "Inland
fashion" the Arch Duke Francis Ferdinand, Heir Apparent to the
Emperor of Austria, who was visiting Australia. He requested sampling
hunting Australian wildlife, so he experienced some when visiting
Mullengudgery. Hunting in his homeland was his popular sport. The
cigarette case, bearing the R.oyal Coat of Arms of the late Austrian
Empire, was his memento to the Campbell family. It still is an
heirloom of the family.
The Arch Duke was assassinated in 1914 and caused World War 1#




COLIN CHARLES CAMPBELL.
Colin Charles the first child born sth October, 1887 to Charles
and Ann of Yarraman, Quirindi. Colin was educated at Y/alaroi College,
Orange N.S.W. leaving 1902 at 16 years.
When his father "walked off" Mullengudgery in 1902, Colin
accompanied him by rail to Bourke with his younger brother Hugh aged
14 years. From there they travelled per wagonette with horses the
200 miles north along the Warrego River to Wallen, north of Cunna-
mulla. When 21 years old, his parents toured the world during 1907
leaving him managing Wallen and responsible,with his aunt Charlotte
Occleston responsible for his brothers and sisters. He did so well
with his total responsibilities, that his father, true to the
Campbell tradition, assessed the value of his assets and gave Colin
his share to commence his own life. His share was £3,000 with a
guarantee of £2,000. With that capital ho selected two grazing farms
25 miles south of Charleville and 5 miles east of Wallal Siding.
These two leases he called Colombo after the name of that Parish.
They totalled 38*000 acres of undeveloped lands with little permanent
water.
He subdivided the country with fences, sank an artesian bore to
I
some 2,000 feet from which he got some half million gallons per day of
water to be distributed in drains to well water the whole property.
He built a fine homestead, wool shed, staff accommodation, out-
buildings, yards etc. His planning and industry were so efficient
that it attracted favourable comments.
Colin prospered with Colombo and in 1912 he sold one half
interest in it to his brother, Hugh, and bought one half interest in
Wallen from his father. He managed Wallen until he died in Sydney
on 13/10/1964.
He was an elected member of the Paroo Shire Council for many
years and was an active member of the United G-raziers Association
all his life.
On 9/9/32 he married Muriel Amy, only daughter of William
Ferguson, ov/ner of Coongoola South, near Cunnamulla,
In 1962 Colin was stricken by a stroke which severely
incapacitated him.
In later years, with her family grown up, Muriel built her


own home in Sydney where she spent most of her later life and there
Colin finally spent his last crippled days.
Colin’s and Muriel’s family were :
Fergus bom 16/9/35 married Primrose Stirling 31/7/71•
John " 25A/37 " Diane Leggo 30/l/l9?0.

HUGH OCCLESTON CAMPBELL.
Hugh Occleston was the second son of Charles and Ann Campbell,
born 29th April, 1889 at Quirindi• He was named after his paternal
uncle Hugh and after his maternal family, Occleston.
He was educated privately at home, then as a boarder at a
G-oulburn College during 1902/3. Accompanied his father at 14 years
of age by rail to Bourke and then by wagonette with horses, travelling
by road 200 miles north up the Warrego River to Wallen, arriving
April, 1903.
Upon attaining his majority in 1909, his father gave him his
share of the family estate amounting to £4*ooo cash with which he
purchased a grazing farm called koto, JO miles north west of Wallen
with 500 cattle. The area was of 20,000 acres, developed with
homestead and necessary buildings, plant and horses. In 1911 he sold
the cattle to Peter Smith with which to stock his new home "Brigalow"
on the Paroo River.
In 1912 he sold Roto to the Schmidt family and he bought one
half interest in Colombo from his brother Colin. He managed the new
partnership successfully until 1918 when he sold his interest back
to Colin and went to New South Wales and bought Westgrove Station near
Manilla.
In New South Wales Hugh experienced droughty years, but the
rabbit plague where he was located, was something he knew nothing
about. Both conditions caused him loss and hardship. He managed
to sell out after difficulty getting enough funds to meet his
liabilities in 1925. After selling Westgrove he returned to
Queensland with his family and purchased Murrumbah near Coongoola,
part of the Coongoola lease, area 35,000 acres.
Hugh 1 s father-in-law helped him finance the purchase of
Murrumbah. His own family interests in Merino Downs and Wallen
gifted him the stock and plant to get established.
In 1926 his brother Alan sold him The Depot, an adjoining part
of the Coongoola Lease of some 25,000 acres, into which the
Queensland Primary Producers Co-operative Association financed him.
Surviving the dreadful depression of 1929/30/32, Hugh gradually
retrieved his tough financial position and decided to sell Murrumbah
under the first favourable conditions that had prevailed since 1928.


lie sold in 1937 and took his family to Sydney,
He, with his family, retired to Castle Hill near Sydney,
investing in considerable real estate. Unable to adapt himself to
city life, Hugh took several positions in Live Stock Agencies, first
in Sydney and in the Riverina. Later he came to Queensland where
he was manager for some years of the Australian Estates Company
branches in both Charleville and in Roma, After retiring from Company
employment, he finally became Representative for the Country Party,
travelling various country districts until he finally retired from
all active positions in 1 965, He died in Brisbane in 1966,
Hugh married the only daughter of Dr. Professor Arthur E. Mills
of Sydney in 1916, They had one daughter Ann born 1920 and one son
Alan David bom 1926.


ANNIE ELIZA JESSIE CAMPBELL.
Annie Eliza Jessie was the eldest daughter of Charles Ann
Campbell, born Dubbo 27/9/1892. Educated by governess at home and
then as a boarder at the Brisbane Girls’ Grammar School from 1908
to 1909 inclusive#
Her name Annie honoured her Mother, Eliza, her Grandmother
(maternal) and Jessie in honour of her paternal Aunt, Jessie Smith
with whom she was closely associated in childhood#
She arrived at Wallen with her family on Ist August, 1903 in
her 11th year. She married Arthur David Forsyth in Charleville on
23/9/1948 and settled for all her married life in their jointly
owned home, 35 Broughton Road, Artarmon N.S.W. Her husband died
after a period of ill health on 12/10/197'i and was cremated in
Brisbane. In 1972 she sold her home in Artarmon and settled in
Brisbane#
After Charles, her father, purchased Merino Downs in 1912, he
later formed the firm Charles Campbell cl Sons Pty#Ltd. of 34>000
shares paid to 13/4 each of par value £l. That firm acquired the
station with stock and plant. The shares were allotted to his wife
12,000, and to each daughter 10,000, to each son 100, thus retaining
1,700 for himself.
On her father’s death, Jessie inherited his 1,700 shares.
On her Mother’s death, she inherited one third of the 12,000
shares, that is 4>ooo from that estate. Thus in 1950, her total
holding was 15>700 shares when the family partnership was liquidated.
if
Jessie held one quarter interest in the Joint Venture Partnership
of stock and plant.


HELENA MAY CAMPBELL.
Helena May was the youngest daughter of Charles and Ann
Campbell, born at Mullengudgery 8/2/1898. Educated by governess at
home until sent to the Brisbane G-irls' G-ramrnar School from 1910 to
1913 inclusive. Her first name honoured her maternal aunt, her
second is of unknown origin. She arrived at Valien with her family
1/8/1903.
She married on 22/6/1922 at Merino Downs, Hugh Andrew, eldest
son of Andrew Scott part owner of the old established Hornet Bank
Station near Taroom on Dawson River. Hornet Bank lease has never
changed hands since it was selected by Hugh Andrew Scott's grand-
father, Andrew Scott in 1853*
After two years, the married couple living at Hornet Bank,
left there when Hugh bought one half interest in Colombo from Colin
1924. Their family of 2 sons and 2 daughters were born and reared
there.
Hugh contracted a cerebral thrombosis in 1953 which permanently
incapacitated him. In 1958 Helena and Hugh moved to settle permanently
in their house at 46 Oleander Drive, Ashgrove, Brisbane. Hugh died
there in 1969.
In 1929 Merino Downs had added to it Cooinda of 8,500 acres
freehold. Both stations were worked together with Dalmally 13,500
acres freehold. The stock, plant etc. were sold to a Joint Venture
Account or partnership termed "A.J.Campbell, A.E.J.Campbell and
H.M.Scott”. Alan held one half interest, his sisters shared the
other half.
Upon forming Charles Campbell &. Sons Pty.Ltd. to acquire Merino
Downs stock and plant, Charles Campbell, her father, allotted Helena
10,000 shares of £1 paid to 13/4 each. Upon her Mother's death,
Helena inherited one third of her Mother's holding of 12,000 which
brought Helena's total holding at time of dissolution of the family
partnership and of the Joint Venture in 1950 to 14,000 shares. Vhen
in 1950 she chose to accept all the shares of Charles Campbell A
Sons'Pty.Ltd. and thus the assets, in the form of Merino Downs
10,000 acres consolidated land with some 5,000 ewes, plus some cattle
and plant.

ALAN JOHNSTON CAMPBELL.
Alan J. Campbell*s guiding philosophy :
"The difference between the difficult and the impossible
is the latter takes more time#"
JHan Johnston, third son Charles and Annie Campbell, born
Dubbo 31st July, 1895* Educated by governess at home, then as
boarder at Toowoomba Grammar School from 1908 to 1910 inclusive.
Inspiration for first name is unknown, his second name is to honour
his maternal grandmother’s Clan Johnston of Annandale, who was second
daughter of Eliza and Charles Johnston of Annandale.
His Bth birthday was celebrated while travelling by rail from
Sydney to Wallangarra, Toowoomba, arriving at Coongoola and Wallen
on Ist August, 1903.
He left school late in 1910, having won a prize for languages.
The school advised his father that he continue his studies, preferably
in the sciences. His father debated this suggestion with Alan who
rejected the idea in definite preference to the independent life of
a grazier.
At the age of 16 Alan was overseer to his brother Hugh, who was
managing Wallen for their father. When Hugh sold Roto he purchased
one half interest in Colombo from Colin and undertook the management
in 1912. His father, having sold one half of Wallen to Colin in that
year, was attracted by several attributes of the Roma district which
he visited in 19*12. fie inspected several stations, finally decided
to purchase Merino Downs. So from 1912 until 1914* Alan lived at
Wallen working as overseer for his brother Colin.
At busy times for the cattle work at Mt. Alfred, he would strike
across country to Mt. Alfred with his own stock horses and help Peter
Smith and son Jack. Returning from one of these trips, back to Wallen
in November, 1914 he decided to enlist for overseas Y/ar service. He
was sworn in 14th December, 1914 at Enoggera and placed into the
3rd Reinforcements of the 2nd Light Horse Regiment A.I.F.
He managed to pass his medical examinations for Army service
regardless of some damage to his right eye. This eye was originally
hurt when he was six years old when a son of Dr. Hickey of Nyngan,


threw a stick into Alan*s eye. No damage was made to the sight.
As a precaution to ultimate trouble, Alan's father taught him to
shoot from either shoulder. Late in 1910 while still at school,
on the playing fields, Alan received an orange, thrown in the dusk
which struck him in the right eye causing some damage and some
hospital treatment. The top half of the field of vision was affected.
His father took him to Sydney where the leading eye specialist,
Dr. Antill Pockley, examined the eye. The Doctor advised that a small
blister had formed upon the retina which he could drain with a
hypodermic needle, but was not confident the blister would not refill.
He advised to take the risk that his youthfulness would enable him
to grow out of the trouble. His father suggested that as he was
booked to sail for England with his wife and daughter Jessie, that
he would take Alan if the London Doctors could do any more to
certainly recover full field of vision. Dr. Pockley did not think
more could be done in London. The voyage was eventually cancelled.
After training at Enoggera camp, Alan's unit sailed from
Pinkenbah on 9th February, 1915 on the troop ship "Itria" with a
large number of horses for the Light Horse in Egypt. The Itria
voyaged through Indonesian waters to Colombo. After a day ashore
there, they sailed for their destination, landing at Suez on 24th
March, 1915 and at the Abbassiah Barracks the next day.
The First Light Horse Brigade (Alan's Unit) moved from its
Heliopolis camp on Bth May, 1915 leaving its 1,600 horses behind, and
sailed for Anzac. Alan was in the first reinforcements to the
Regiment which he joined in Monash Valley on 14th July, 1915* The
Brigade was occupied defending Pope's and Quinn's Posts from May
until sth September. Then it was transferred to the Suvla side of
Anzac, the Second Regiment being encamped at N 0.3 Outpost, a second
line of defence. All units had been greatly reduced in numbers, hence
its first posting to a second line of defence since landing at Anzac
in May.
The Second Regiment at full strength had 560 men. By 6th August,
1915 there had been over 200 reinforcements added, but on that day
the ration strength was 132 men survivors.
On 4th and 3th August the Regiment attacked the Turkish trenches


opposite, some 20 yards away. The fighting was intense, the
Regimental attacking lines were decimated, many of them falling
back into their own trenches. This caused much difficulty and
confusion for the Second Regiment, enabling the defending Turkish
soldiers opposite to stand up to bombard the Regiment*s trenches
with hand grenades. After clearing the front trenches of dead and
wounded men the defenders had to organise for every second man to
stand ready with a sand bag or a great coat to drop over bombs that
dropped into the trench, thus helping to protect those soldiers
combatting the Turks and resisting them attack the confused
Australian position. Most defending soldiers received bomb
splinters in their legs, some received mortal wounds. Alan was able,
when the position was restored, to extract some bomb splinters as
did his mates. V/hile he was busily engaged shooting over the parapet
one bomb exploded near his head, but the force of the explosion was
somewhat cushioned by loose gravel. The major force of this
explosion caught Alan’s right eye which caused total loss of sight.
Later it was found that the lens had been blown with force against
the Optic Nerve, the lens being split by the force. Also later
two doctors advised they suspected a steel splinter was still in the
eye which was rendered totally useless.
On 11th November, 1915> some 80 men of the Second Regiment were
sent to Lemnos Island to recover from their long service on Anzac,
mostly survivors from long term service, sent to recover health and
to recuperate. On 23rd December they were shipped (after the
evacuation) along with a large number of other troops, some 2,800
altogether, on to the Troop Ship "Caledonia", landing at Alexandria
on 27th December.
When Alan and his mates got aboard the Caledonia, the crowding
was so unpleasant that they succeeded in bribing the head steward
who locked them in the Ladies lavatories well below deck where they
remained until ready to go ashore at Alexandria. The steward fed
them upon good ship-crew food. On Christmas Day they actually
enjoyed Plumb Pudding, fresh roast beef, and above all, a large
dixie of beerl*. The party was quite comfortable in these strange
quarters. The party consisted of Alan, R.S.Sword, Harold Newton,
Bob Thompson, Ralph Arnold and Brown.


Upon its return to its base camp at Heliopolis, the First
Brigade was rested and refitted. On 14th January, 19*16 it departed
south to get desert training at Wha Dan on the edge of the Sahara.
On the 26th January it was entrained to Southern Egypt some couple
hundred miles and took up positions along the Western Edge of
Southern Egypt covering perhaps 100 miles. From these positions,
they were to defend Egypt against Senussi Arab raiders from the
numerous Oases in mid Sahara. The Regiments had to patrol the old
Arab Trade Routes. On 13th May, 1916 the Brigade was entrained
and travelled non-stop to Kantara on the Canal. After a few days
there, it moved east into the Sinai Desert, finally making camp at
Romani Oasis where it stayed off and on until 6th November.
On the 4th and sth August, the Brigade was heavily engaged in
fighting the Battle of Romani. After that successful battle, the
Brigade took an active part in pushing the Turkish/G-erman Army back,
fighting many severe engagements at various Oases and Hods, the
most severe was at Bir-el-Abd.
Finally, the Brigade was to occupy El Arish on 21st December.
On 23rd and 24th December the Brigade advanced south of El Arish to
Maghdaba, a heavily fortified group of redoubts. After fighting
all day the Second Regiment, with part of the Third Brigade, in
desperation as darkness approached, they galloped to the Turkish
trenches, jumping over the Turks’ heads and dismounting amongst them
to force the total collapse of the fortifications. This was the
first galloping charge to be successful, but not the last one. Alan
was in this charge with Denny Walker of Gin Gin Station. 1,200
prisoners were captured.
On 9th January, 1917 the Brigade was again heavily engaged in
the Battle of Rafa where Turkish/German resistance was stubborn,
causing the victorious attacking forces many casualties.
On 19th April, 1917 the Second Regiment participated in the
second Battle of Gaza which cost our Forces some 16,000 killed,
without any success. The First Brigade of Light Horse attacked the
southern flank of the Gaza position of fortifications. Next day the
Second Regiment was bombed by a German airplane while it was in
’•route of march" formation inflicting many casualties in both men and


horses while in such compact formation.
On sth May Alan, after having much trouble with his eyes
heavily inflamed, paraded upon sick leave. The Doctor diagnosed the
trouble as Conjunctivitis of both eyes and sent him to hospital. He
arrived per hospital train at the 14th Australian General Hospital
in old military barracks at Abbassiah, near Cairo on Bth May. Pie was
confined to bed in a ward of 80 beds under the care of three
Australian Sisters. After examination, his chart was inscribed as
Conjunctivitis in both eyes with Defective Action of the Heart (D.A.H.),
the latter accounting for his being confined to bed for complete rest
for some time. His condition was told him by his Doctors Mitchell and
Blackbume (later Sir).
In the middle of June, Alan was Boarded, the verdict being B
Class and unfit for further active service. On 17th June, 1917? Alan
was sent to the Australian Depot Stores at Ghezirah where he stayed
until 1919, allotted to several duties.
Soon after arriving at the A.D.S. he, with two others, was
allotted each 38 men to form three guards for the Camp. Alan was
made an Acting Sergeant for this job. They trained their guards so
satisfactorily that they were deputed to relieve the English Guards
permanently.
On 10th March, 1918 he was relieved of his guard and given
responsibility in the Kit Bag Stores. On 20th March he was placed
in charge of the 2*oo Turkish prisoners in two compounds at the Camp.
He retained his rank with the responsibility for the food, discipline
and clothing of the prisoners. Pie had a Corporal as assistant and
worked quite independently of all other sections and staff of the Camp.
Alan was relieved of his responsibility on 21st February, 1919, sent to
Moascar Base Camp on the Bitter Lakes to catch the Troop Ship "Port
Sydney" on sth March, 1919, disembarking at the Quarantine Station
at Portsea, Melbourne, 13th April.
He received Piis Army discharge in Melbourne on 17th April, 1919
with long leave, about 6 months. Upon Piis return from Piis 2*4" years
of War Service in the Middle East and a rest period to re-adjust himself
Alan took up residence with Piis parents and two sisters at Merino
Downs. His father, having settled Merino Downs and the bulk of the


shares in Charles Campbell & Sons Pty.Ltd. upon his Mother and two
sisters, proceeded to gift the remainder of his estate upon Alan.
This was his remaining half interest in Wallen, stocked with over
17,000 sheep, couple of hundred cattle, plus horses and plant. Colin
owned the other half of Wallen and was manager. Alan concluded there
was no useful purpose in participating in the management of Wallen,
so he quickly assumed the management of Merino Downs for the family.
Although he owned only 100 shares in Charles Campbell & Sons
Pty.Ltd. his salary for managing was fixed at £IOO per year, later
raised to £125 p*a. until the Joint Venture formed.
Yttien Alan took control of Merino Downs there were some 5,000
mixed sheep, plus a few cattle, horses and plant. It was of 10,000
acres freehold, poorly watered and badly fragmented, namely, one
4,000 acre block joining Merino Downs at one comer with another
block of 1,200 acres joining that block at the next corner. It was
interwoven with Dalmally.
When Alan assumed responsibility for Merino Downs, the debt was
some £IO,OOO, about I+Ofo of its market value. By 1924 Alan paid off
the debts and declared the first dividend, later followed by surplus
profits being invested with which help pay for Cooinda.
In 1928 Alan negotiated the purchase of Cooinda of 8,500 acres
freehold adjoining Merino Downs, without stock or plant at £2-10-0
per acre. He stocked it immediately with 5,000 cast for age ewes from
the well known high quality flock of Weribone Station near Surat.
When Alan took control of Merino Downs in 1920,the cattle boom
had collapsed, some herds being offered to those who would muster them
and take them off the station - worthless! At the end of 1920 the
Wartime Wool Acquisition Scheme ended, after the long period of
growers having sold their wool clips at an average price of 15i pence
per pound. With the knowledge of the Imperial Wool Acquisition
Scheme having on hand 8 million bales surplus wool, the free market
collapsed in face of this flood of wool to be sold.
In 1921 B.A.W.R.A. was formed, a partnership of the Imperial
Government with the wool suppliers, to regulate the sale of supplies.
The only authority that partnership possessed was an Order that no
wool be exported at under 8 pence per pound average. Thus 8 pence
per pound became the "unprotected" Floor Price for 8.A.Yf.8-.A. to work


on with free auctions. The market immediately steadied, permitting
B,A.W.R,A. to continuously increase the floor price, reaching in 1924
an average price of 24 pence, at which average the remainder of the
wartime accumulation of wool was cleared.
Regardless of this ’’marketing miracle” the woolgrowers stupidly
rejected by popular ballot, the invitation for B.A.W.R.A. to be
permanently continued.
In May 1927 Merino Downs organised and paid for a world tour
for Charles and Annie Campbell and Charlotte Occleston,
By 1922 Alan had re-organised the Merino Downs flock, lifting
it to a profitable standard, then he addressed himself to his own
interests in Wallen, There had, as elsewhere, been some droughty
years, causing the Wallen flock to shrink from 17,000 to some 10,000
without any surplus to sell and without any profit. In conference
Alan and Colin failed to agree upon a policy to restore profitability,
so they decided to liquidate the partnership. They decided upon a
price that Colin would pay for Alan 1 s interests, except the flock
which had to be divided individually, Alan selling his share of the
sheep immediately upon the divided actions,
Alan purchased Mt. Alfred, Brigalow and Spring Creek on the Paroo
River and later selected an adjoining vacant block called Duganbah,
thus consolidating the whole aggregation admirably. In Alan’s
purchase were some 3,000 cattle, horses and plant. The necessary
legal auction formalities attracted no buyers, so the properties were
open for private negotiation, Alan paid his father £I,OOO cash and
his uncle John Campbell*s estate the same amount. He assumed
responsibility for the debt amounting to some £5,000, Peter Smith*s
equity had unfortunately and very sadly, disappeared with the other
partners’ capital, Alan thus secured some quarter of a million acres
of leasehold lands with some 5,000 cattle which promised little profit,
so he decided to develop the two pastoral leases for sheep by erecting
the necessary netting fences. Dingoes had increased to large numbers
so when cattle became profitable at start of the War and that country
made it difficult to maintain dingo-proof fencing, the neighbour to
the north, Yarronvale, abandoned its netted boundary after moving all
sheep so as to stock with cattle. When Alan fenced his pastoral


leases, he used the Yarronvale netting as his protection against
dingoes from the north. Although he spent a large sum renovating
that boundary, the Yarronvale owners would not negotiate a settlement
for its use. They charged Alan excessively by legal process, but
failed. They persuaded the State G-overnment to amend the Fencing Act,
quoting Alan’s actions. After the Fencing Act had been amended they
again charged Alan for high compensation, but again they failed to
get a favourable verdict. Later they lost again to the incoming
selector, Mr. D.S.Boyce, when he selected that land as a grazing farm.
Neighbours to the west had maintained their netting boundaries
and quickly came to terms with Alan for his use of their netting
fences, that was Beechal Station on Beechal Creel:.
By 1924 Alan had successfully fenced about 100,000 acres and
eradicated the dingoes so put 10,000 weaner sheep upon that land,
comprising the two pastoral leases. Soon after the Peel Elver Land
and Mineral Company of New South Wales inspected and bought those
leases for £13,000 cash without stock or plant.
Having sold Mt. Alfred and Beechal East leases, Alan in 1925
found himself with Brigalow of 41,059 acres, Spring Creek (or
Googawaddi) of 42,500 acres and The Duganbah 18,000 acres aggregating
101,559 acres consisting of grazing farm leases, two held in Trust
for him by his sisters. Having only 5 stock paddocks, much sub-
divisional fencing had to be carried out. Alan had hired from the
Government its big boring plant and by engaging his own stafi, sank
an artesian bore to some 2,000 feet, getting a flow of one million
gallons daily. That water was then distributed in some 3° miles of
drains to water the Spring Creek block admirably. He had built a
comfortable homestead, station staff quarters, out-buildings etc.
upon a new bore drain. He also built a new wool shed with necessary
staff quarters, yards etc. again upon a bore drain.
He also purchased a part of the Coongoola lease of some 25,000
acres upon which to fatten bullocks and to rest stock for re-sale.
This block called "The Depot" he sold in 1926 to his brother Hugh
for some £7,000, it adjoining Murrumbah.
During 1926 a severe drought prevailed over all of Central
Queensland, while a fair season was experienced in the southern


districts. This induced many enterprising graziers to buy stock
in the drought areas and truck or drove them to the more favoured
districts. At this time 1926, Alan had been dealing quite heavily
in sheep and cattle. In July he purchased very cheaply 27,000 mixed
sheep from the 95,000 flock being hand fed on Portland Downs on
the Barcoo River, These sheep had to be droved south down the river
to Y/indorah which was the top of the good seasonal area. Upon talcing
delivery, he formed the flocks into three mobs, all had to be fed
daily upon if ounces maize per sheep plus limited quantities of hay.
To transport the weakest sheep or the "Tail-enders" to some patches
of pasture along the route, Alan paid about 5 carriers to construct
crates upon their 6 ton trucks so as to transport the weakest of
those hand fed, drought stricken sheep. This action of loading
sheep proved very heavy manual work.
Fodder depots were established at intervals along the Barcoo
River to guarantee food. The previous year i.e, 1925, Alan had sold
to Mr. Hugh McMaster of Central Queensland, some 2,000 cattle on
Spring Creek. Alan was so impressed with Mr. McMaster’s bush
knowledge, that he offered him a one quarter interest in the profits
from the Portland Downs sheep deal. Of course, as Mr. McMaster
also had just selected some square miles of a lease on Coopers
Creek near Mt.Howett, where the pastures offered wonderful relief
for these drought stricken sheep, the deal was happy for both parties.
Delivery of the Portland Downs sheep took place in August, on
average the driest month, but alas, when the flocks were near
Albilbah on the Barcoo, one night over four inches of rain deluged
them! It was a nerve wracking sight to see thousands of fine sheep
being smothered in the mud, others died in bogs and some died from
the weather. Alan finished with a nervous breakdown from this
tragedy. But after a week, the grass grew fast, giving a market
for the sheep which were quickly sold to great profit even after
losses had exceeded 10,000 head! Compensation had to be paid to
drovers and to truck owners but still the profit was some £s,ooo.nett!
Towards the end of 1926 Alan sold most of his cattle herd on
Spring Creek, getting ready to stock up with sheep, after the dingoes
were eradicated.


To recover from all these activities, Alarms health demanded
rest. Early in January, 1927 he sailed for overseas with his cousin
A,J.Campbell of New South Wales, They toured the Middle East, Europe,
the United Kingdom, Canada and United States of America, altogether
away one year.
In 1928 Alan stocked the Spring Creek holding which included
Brigalow and The Duganbah with 10,000 sheep and sold afterwards to
J,A,Dennis of New South Wales for £30,000 on terms, talcing a mortgage
over the 10,000 sheep sold with the station plus 6,000 sheep which
Dennis owned and added to the mortgaged ones already mentioned.
The latter mob had to travel to Queensland via Goondiwindi because
of droughty conditions en. route. When the great depression arrived
in 1929 much hardship was experienced in the industry, Dennis was
stricken as everybody else. Alan tried to support him at Spring Creek
by meeting his shearing costs etc. However, a crisis arose over the
travelling 6,000 sheep. Financial difficulties kept rising. When
those sheep travelled to Surat, Alan had them shorn and the clip in
Primaries Wool Stores ready for sale. He was contacted by a
representative of the Australian Mercantile Land & Finance Company
who claimed the sheep and wool. They produced a mortgage dated one
day earlier than the one held by Alan, so they took over the sheep and
also the wooll
Legal advisers advised Alan to quickly re-possess Spring Creek,
stock and plant, as result of the Dennis experience. After conforming
to all legal formalities, the property was offered at auction, but
there were no buyers. Eventually Mr. A.A.Griffiths purchased it
unstocked at about £15,000 cash. The sheep had been sold previously.
In 1929 after selling Spring Creek, Alan bought Dalmally of
13,500 acres freehold with 6,000 selected ewes and some plant.
The previous year, 1928, Alan had, on behalf of Charles Campbell
& Sons Pty.Ltd.,negotiated purchase of the adjoining station called
Cooinda, 8,500 acres freehold, unstocked for £2-10-0 per acre. He
also purchased s>ooo cast for aged ewes from the finest flock in
Maranoa, of Weribone Station near Surat, to stock up.
With Alan’s purchase of Dalmally which was interwoven with
Merino Downs, it was wise to run all this consolidated aggregation


as one station. For that purpose a Joint Venture was formed,
comprising and consisting of "A. J. Campbell, A.E.J.Campbell and
H.M.Scott", who took possession of the stock and plant, the lend
being rented from the separate owners. This partnership, owning
highly developed land, concentrated upon sheep breeding, lambing from
15,000 to 17,000 ewes annually, selling the young production.
Latterly from 500 to 1,000 cattle were also depastured on the
aggregation.
Upon forming the Joint Venture and as Dalmally home was veiy
comodious with 23 rooms in the main building, Alan invited his parents
and sister Jessie to live in it with him.
Recovery from the great depression of 1929-1932 was painful and
Blow. The wool market and profitability of the grazing industry
was to improve only very slowly until about 1937 when accumulated
debts became possible of redemption, thus at last some degree of
financial liberation appeared upon the distant and still uncertain
horizon.
It was some time after the outbreak of World War Two that the
Menzies Government sold to the British G-overnment, the Australian
Wool Clip at 12g pence per pound average. That sale was at a very-
disappointing price for the woolgrowers who had not quite emerged
from the financial difficulties caused by the great depression.
After about two seasons, the G-overnment managed to get a rise of the
price by two pence per pound which prevailed until the end of the War
and for one year afterwards.
As the great depression began to develop in 1929 and 1930,
t
financial difficulties quickly developed for the grazing industry
as well as for the national economy. G-raziers were non-plussed by
their prospects of survival and sought correct causes and then for
remedies. Alan, as Chairman of the Roma G-raziers Association and
Vice President of the Maranoa G-raziers Association since 1924, was
also on the State Council of the United Graziers Association. He with
some colleagues, worked hard to use their Associations to seek causes
and then to try to find remedies for the intense difficulties of
their industry. They failed to gain sufficient support for action
by the Associations.


Thus frustrated, Alan enlisted the support of his great friend
and man of deep wisdom, Mr. F.R.V.Timbury, solicitor of Roma.
Together they organised and toured the State campaigning to form the
Australian Woolgrowers Association. For one tour they hired a
taxi in Roma and drove 2,600 miles around the sheep districts of
Queensland in 14 days, addressing 19 public meetings. They gained
nearly unanimous support at those well attended meetings. Thus
was organised to conclude the campaign, one big Conference from the
whole State. It met at Roma to confirm the formation of the
Association and to demand a Royal Commission of Inquiry into the
bankrupt condition of the wool industry and also to demand relief from
Government charges and levies etc. to lighten burdens.
Meantime, the Government appointed a Committee of Enquiry and
not a Royal Commission with power to compel evidence. However, the
Committee found that the cost of producing wool ranged from 12 pence
on big units of production to 14 pence upon smaller units. This
finding really alarmed the various Governments. There was little
difficulty to get charges and burdens relieved from the industry
when it was found how badly off it was. Thus can be seen why the
industry was so disappointed when the Menzies Government sold the
National Clip for pence average nearly 10 years later. Costs
had risen by then.
Resulting from the dreadful financial ordeals of the great
depression and from his sustained activities in trying to get relief
for the industry to survive, Alan*s health broke down causing him to
be invalided for seven months in one period.
The War Two period was another difficult time for all graziers,
the biggest problems being shortages of supplies and materials, plus
the acute shortage of labour in the grazing districts where the
young men enlisted into the Armed Forces in large numbers.
In 1943 Alan found himself trying to effectively maintain 25,000
sheep of the family partnership, with two old men and himself, later
to be reinforced with one native# Heavy losses of sheep were
experienced, largely due to labour shortage. Proper control of blow
fly and of worms was quite impossible#


After Y/orld War Two, as happened after World War One, the
Imperial Government had an accumulation of many millions of bales of
surplus wool. With the outstanding success of B.A.Y/.R.A. to guide
the authorities, a similar action was taken i.e. Joint Organisation
was formed to assume control of the liquidation of the wartime
surplus and to regulate the supply to the market of the growing clip.
These actions caused the wool market to gradually rise to attractive
heights, giving woolgrowers their only prosperous period after 20
years of povertyl
Joint Organisation like B.A.Y/.R.A. distributed a wonderful
"windfall" profit from the successful sale of the accumulated wool.
Also, like B.A.Y/.R.A-., the woolgrowers were invited by popular ballot
to decide if they wished that form of marketing to be continued.
Again the woolgrowers were so stupid as to reject this valuable offer.
Again in 1965 the woolgrowers rejected another similar offer for
organised marketing.
Nov/ in early 1970 s the woolgrowers have not been invited to
accept this same form of wool marketing. It has been initiated
without their irresponsible opinion. That is the wool clip is being
sold to save the growers and to lift them from a severe price
depression, by means of a Floor Price with Free Auctions. I wonder
if any of those who voted "No" against continuing the successful
marketing of their wool as per firstly, B.A.Y/.R.A. and 20 odd years
later the Joint Organisation, have ever realised their utter folly.
I also wonder if they ever make it their duty to remember those
"wise men" who actively campaigned to get a "No" vote. Those
traitors indeedl
The great depression proved how utterly futile are primary
producer organisations when they so indolently declare themselves to
be non-political. Y/hen they organise M no"votes they are usually
ignored by all governments in their efforts to secure redress from
legislative and administrative burdens upon their industry.
Alan*s big and expensive efforts to organise relief and
assistance for the wool industry in its dire extremity during the
great drpression, convinced him that the only effective activity
for any rural industry to demand redress, was to organise votes.


Then they can expect political respect and acknowledgment.
Resulting from his bitter and frustrating experiences on behalf
of the wool industry, Alan abandoned further industrial efforts and
concentrated upon the widespread movements to form an independent
Country Party in 1935*
In March 1935* he as Chairman of the Roma G-raziers Branch, called
a meeting of the members to try to form a complimentary political
organisation to the Country Party in New South Wales. It was not
until May that they managed to get proper direction from Dr. Sir
Earle Page and the Hon. J.A.J.Hunter, to form a Branch based upon
the New South Viales Country Party. They held meetings each month
following i.e. June and July. This Country Party Branch joined
with others formed and forming, by supporting the action of the
Stanthorpe Branch in calling the Conference in Toowoomba on 4th
and sth March, 1936 to then form the Queensland Country Party.
After a couple of years, the new Party failed to get going so Alan
inspired and financed a revolutionary body to become the Western
Division of the Queensland Country Party at Roma. With spontaneous
local support, the Western Division grew and expanded rapidly to
eventually "swallow" the parent body. In Toowoomba, a Country
Party Conference held June 1944 abandoned the Queensland Country
Party and adopted the Western Division Constitution, forming the
Australian Country Party - Queensland, with Alan as President until
1951> when he retired. He was actually elected President of the
Queensland Country Party by the Central Council in October, 1943*
When he retired because of indifferent health, he claimed 35 ,000
members of the Party,
Alan*s health broke down in 1946, causing him to liquidate
his family aggregation at Dalmally, Merino Downs and Cooinda. With
harsh fixation of land values, upon 1942 levels, Alan had to await
modification of those laws to get fair values. Hence he waited
until 1950 to make the sales and the liquidations. His sister,
H.M.Scott, chose to take as her share of interests, a consolidated
Merino Downs of 10,000 acres freehold, with some s*ooo ewes plus
some cattle, horses and plant. Alan and Jessie took cash for their
shares of the Joint Venture and lands. Alan retired to Brisbane


to live permanently.
At the time of this family liquidation, the shareholdings in
Charles Campbell & Sons Pty. Ltd. were : Jessie Forsyth was originally
allotted 10,000 shares. Her father left her his holding of some
1,700 shares. Her Mother divided her 12,000 holding equally between
Jessie, Helena and Alan. That gave Jessie 15,700 shares, Helena
14,000 and Alan 4,100 shares.
11l health continued to affect Alan, so he sought relief from
all responsiblity. He retired in 1951 from the Presidency of the
Australian Country Party - Queensland, accepting lesser offices until
1968 when he finally retired altogether from all Party offices and
activities.
To try to secure better health Alan took a six months’ Safari to
East Africa in 195^• Being free of much business preoccupation, Alan
devoted most of his time after 1951, wandering the more remote regions
of the earth, as well as the European and American continents and Asia.
In 1965, having wandered at various periods through Asia, Middle
East and Europe to England, he married on 19th May, 1965 Barbara Jane
Dunn of Brisbane. After touring England, they together went wandering
through Europe to Egypt, then taking ship through the Suez Canal to
Kenya, continuing the voyage for a month to Madagascar, La Reunion and
Mauritius, returning again to Madagascar, to the Comono Islands,
Tanzania and Kenya. After touring East Africa, Uganda and then
Ethiopia, they flew to Aden, catching ship back to Sydney, completing
a year’s travelling.
Returning to Brisbane, the newly weds took over Barbara’s Mother’s
home in Indooroopilly. As Mrs. C.L.Dunn was confined to an invalid
Nursing Home, it was most convenient for Alan and Barbara to settle
in her home, it being unoccupied and close to the Nursing Home.
Again in 1971 the couple toured the world for a year, returning
in 1972. Soon after they purchased a new home in Kenmore, making
themselves very comfortable with many interests to keep them from
further long voyaging around the world. They sold the Dunn family
home ‘in Indooroopilly in August, 1972.
Alan was elected a Life Member in 1951 of the Maranoa Graziers
Association and of the United Graziers Association for his services
rendered those organisations. The Australian Country Party -


Queensland elected him a Life Member in 195&.
The Royal Geographical Society of Australasia elected him in
1956 a Life Fellow,
The Royal Geographical Society of London elected him a Life
Fellow in 1972,
In 1973 Her Majesty awarded him a Companion of the Most
Dintinguished Order of Saint -Michael and Saint George, Copy of
the Citation is reproduced upon the following page.


HONOURS AND AWARDS
QUEEN'S BIRTHDAY, 1973
APPOINTED A COMPANION OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED ORDER
OF ST. MICHAEL AND ST. GEORGE
ALAN JOHNSTON CAMPBELL, ESQUIRE
CITATION
GOVERNMENT HOUSE,
BRISBANE.
For distinguished public service in rural and associated fields of endeavour.
Prior to his retirement from active grazing pursuits, Mr. Campbell
spent almost a lifetime in helping to develop the wool industry in South-West
Queensland. Over a thirty-year span, his efforts resulted in a marked improve-
ment of general industry standards.
Realising that the lot of his fellows in the rather remote rural com-
munities in which he lived could be more quickly up-graded by concerted action,
Mr. Campbell directed several grazing industry campaigns towards that end.
He became a Member of the Maranoa Graziers'Association and was a Councillor
of the State body for four years before becoming President of the Australian
Woolgrowers' Association.
Mr. Campbell's perspicacity is shown by the clear recognition he had
that this wool industry and rural improvement objective could be further expedited
in a suitable political climate. He gave liberally of his time and effort for the
Australian Country Party - Queensland and was President of that body for eight
years from 1943 to 1951. He was also elected to the Trusteeship of both State
and Federal levels of the Country Party, positions he held until his retirement
in 1968. He enjoys Life Membership of this organisation.
Ever mindful of the needs of country people, Mr. Campbell travelled
extensively, at his own expense, both in Australia and overseas, investigating
many aspects of rural industries. He was responsible in some measure for
accelerating the movement which culminated in the establishment of rural train-
ing schools in Queensland.
Mr. Campbell's knowledge of land matters in the State is widely recog-
nised and availed of by Government and the private sector and his submissions
to the Government have been, to some degree, responsible for improvements in
the legislative sphere.
Mr. Campbell served his country in war as well as in peace and was
with the Australian Light Horse in Egypt and surrounding areas in World War I.
Since his retirement, Mr. Campbell has devoted himself largely to the
work of the Royal Geographical Society of Australasia. He was awarded a Fellow-
ship of that body, has served as Australian President and is also a Life Member.


OCCLESTON FAMILY.
Copied from Ormrod's History of Cheshire which was copied from
Ormrod from Dooms Day Book.
It does not appear where Occleston, or Oclustone as it is spelt
in Dooms Day Book, became united to the Barony of Shipbrook, of which
it now forms part, but it is certain that in A.D. 1199, before the
time of King John, it belonged to local lords, who assumed the name
of the place. The following notices are extracted from the Plea
Rolls :
A.D.13Q7 Edward 1.1. John Lord of Occleston gave to William, son of
Thomas, son of Emma de Occleston, the land which his father
Thomas, son of Emma and Ellen his mother held.
Edward 1.1 John Lord of Wettenhall, gave to William Lord of
Occleston, a messuage called the Hall of Occleston, in exchange
for other lands in the same village.
A.D.1327 The same William gave the Manor of Occleston to William, his
son and Christina his wife and their heirs.
A.D.1R13. Henry V. Amilia, widow of John Tom cousin and heir of
William de Occleston Sen. releases from her and her heirs to
Richard, son of David de Bunbury, all her rights and title in
the Manor of Occleston in whose family it continued till 12th
year of
-■-.D.1603. King James when it was again sold.
Extracts from another History of Cheshire :
If a visit is paid to the Occleston Shrine in the Rostherne
Church yard, he will find later records in stone that will supply a
retrospect of the great Occleston family for nearly the last two
centuries. I have often wondered at the great number of graves in
Rostherne Church yard near Boudon bearing this uncommon name. There
are families of the name at High Sea Mere, Boudon, Liverpool,
Manchester, Glazebrook and Occleston near Sandback Cheshire.


Another history of Cheshire by Francis White 1,860 :
Occleston is a small scattered village and township in the
Northwich Hundred, pleasantly situated on the Western bank of the
River Wheeloch if miles S.S.W. from Middlewich contains 747 acres
0 roods 13 perches of land and in 185*1 had 17 houses and 117
inhabitants of whom 55 were males and 62 females. Ratable value
£833-16-0. The township before the reign of King John gave to a
family which continued Lords of the Manor till after the reign of
Henry V about year 1370 it was sold to Sir Hugh Calverley who gave
it in exchange to David de Bunbury for the Bunbury Church and it
continued in the Bunbury family till the year 1614 A.D. when Sir H.
Bunbury sold it to William Moreton Esq. for £6OO and 10 years later
he sold it to Sir John Davenport for £14,000.
The Manor House is a neat brick building in the occupancy of
Mrs. Francis Cristy 1860. Now Mr. Broad lives there - 1903.
Some names on graves in Rothennes Church yard, copied by
S. Oswald and Helen H. Occleston about 10 years ago :
"Here lyeth the body of Betty daughter of William and Ann
Occleston of Mere who departed this life Bth February, 1777 aged
16 years."
Also -
"Ann, wife of William Occleston (mentioned above) who departed
this life 4th October, 1777 aged 62 years."
Also -
"The above William Occleston Sen. who departed this life 15th
January, 1797 A.D. aged 83 years."
"Here lyeth the body of Mary Worthington, widpr sister to
John Occleston of - who departed this life Ist December, 1747 A.D.
aged 91 years."
"Here lyeth the body of Ann wife of John Occleston of Mere who
died 27 February, 1706 A.D."
"Here lyeth the body of Hannah the wife of John Stross of One
died 3 February, 1710".
Also -
"Here lyeth the body of John Occleston Sen. departed this life
6th August, 1746 aged 88 years."

There are any number of graves up to the present date. All the
names are as now, Thomas, G-eorge, John, Henry, William, James, Mary,
Sarah, Frances, Emice, Christine.
My son has proposed that the families unite and erect a brass in
the Church, all the names from out of the Register as many names of
the graves are so old the writing is obliterated. The late Rector
would willingly have consented but the present one is very
and demanding £1 for each year. As there are hundreds of years it is
absurd, but we are young to try and move in the matter.
There has never been any coat of arms or crest of this ancient
family, discovered.
We examined in Chester the will of John Occleston who died in
A.D.1603 hoping his seal would be attached, but it was not.
A cousin Robert Occleston, a has searched everywhere
but not found one. The motto was adopted ’’The wrath of the lion
is noble” but we have never used a crest.
(copied by Alan J, Campbell, September, 1970 from very aged
hand written papers).


IS YOUR NAME OCCLESTON?
CHESHIRE LIFE 1 ’- JUNE 1969.
If so, no doubt your ancestors lived in the Township of
Occleston in the Hundred of Northwich. Prior to the time of King
John, Occleston, mentioned in Domesday, was in the possession of
local lords having adopted the name of the place* In 1311* William,
son of John de Okleston, was mentioned in a legal action relating
to lands in the Township* In 1319, John, lord of Occleston, gave to
William, son of Thomas de Occleston, the land which was formerly held
by Thomas and Ellen, his father and mother. Two years later, John
de Wettenhall gave William Occleston Hall in exchange for other lands
in the village. In 1327* William gave the Manor of Occleston to his
son William,
Some years later, John de Occleston, probably son of William,
gave the manor to Hamon, son of John Dobbison. Hamon made John de
Occleston his bailiff in 1370. John bought some property in Middlewich
in 1383 and his widow purchased a salt pit there in 1392. John must
have recovered the manor because he sold it to Sir Hugh Calveley who
gave it to David de Bunbury,
In 1415> Amilia, cousin and heir of William de Occleston senior,
probably son of John, released all his rights in the manor to Richard,
son of David de Bunbury,
The main line of the family having died out, a junior branch
carried on the name and were to be found as small landowners within
the county. Thomas de Occleston held land in Mobblerley in the
fifteenth century and in 1695* Henry Ocklestone was living in
Prestbury. He was elected usher at the G-rammar School but refused the
appointment.
No arms appear to have been recorded.




THE JOHNSTON CLAN.
It is a large Clan owning large estates in Drumfreshire,
Scotland upon the English border. The headquarters estate was and
is Annandale which has for long been held in Trust, evidently
because no direct personal claim has succeeded.
Some centuries ago the English King mobilised forces to
invade and capture Ireland. The Johnston Clan supplied ct ~L cikL e
contingent and as reward, was granted large estates which it
seemed to name Annandale after the ancestral home in Scotland.
It seems that Charles Johnston migrated from Ireland to
Melbourne where he established his family.
Through the ancestral- Scottish home, Annandale, there seems
to be a common relationship between Charles Johnston and Colonel
George Johnston of Annandale of Sydney.
