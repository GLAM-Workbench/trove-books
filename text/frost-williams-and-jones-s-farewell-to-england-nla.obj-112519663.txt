W. Pratt, Printer, 83, Digbeth, Birmingham.
As I walked through the ’own of Portsmouth,
1 heard three wreti hed men to say,
Farewell our dearest wives and children,
We can with you no longer stay.
In agony and broken hearted.
We are compelled behind to leave.
Our native land, our friends and kindred,
For our awful fate to grieve.
CHORUS.
Across the seas Frost, Jones, and Williams,
Through tempests and dreadlu! gaies,
e leave our native Find behind us.
To end our days in New South Wales.
At Monmouth we were tried for treason.
And we were condemned to die,
Great and small throughout tre nation,
For to save our lives did try,
England, Ireland, Wa ! es, and Scotland,
Manifold for ns did STtve,
And through a deal of perseverance,
Government did spare our lives.
Sad was the day we drew together,
Thousands of men from far and near,
Which caused grief and consternation,
In every part of Monmouthshire,
That fatal day we’ll b ng remember,
Wtich caused distress on every mini,
Jt vas Ue third of ast November,
Eightesn hundred and thirty nine.
f ens of thousands have petitioned,
Overcome with grief and woe.
Every rank in all conditions,
A free pardon for us to gain.
Wfi anxiously each hour expected,
That some messenger to see.
To our dismal ceils a pro-.thing,
With the sound at liberty.
But ah ! we were mistaken.
All hopes have p o od m vain,
We forever now are banished.
Never to return ag .in,
A long farewell our wives and children,
A ieu ( ur friends and neighbours dear,
While i t slavery we are pinin/,
Oft we ll think of Monmouthshire.
Happy with our wives and children.
We on our native find might be.
If the length of our misfortunes
We could only once foresee.
Oh ! for th se we leave behind us,
From cur eyes run floods of tears,
A 1 ho’ from death they have reprieved us.
We think our sentence too severe.
Many' a heart will beat in sorrow,
Many an eye will shed a tear.
Many an orphan and its mother.
Will lament in Monmouthshire.
For the third of of iasl November,
When their father went astray,
Many of thousands wil! remember.
The sad disasters of that day.
We will conclude our mournful dittv.
Which fills our achi tg hearts with pain.
Shed for i s a tear of pity,
We never shall return again.
And when we’ve reached our des'ination,
O’er the tolling seas thiough storms & gales.
Oh any you live at home in comfort.
While we lament iu New South Wales.
