REPRINT of JOHN H. WHITE?S LETTERS to the
?CHRISTIAN WORLD? on QUEENSLAND as an
EMIGRATION FIELD.
Prefatory Note to Readers.
These letters are republished in this cheap form so as to place
in easy reach of the million, condensed and plain information
which may guide some who are contemplating removal to new
and wider field of enterprize. That everyone who has it, should
sow broad-cast such information is believed to be a present and
incumbent duty, by
The Author.
Grimsby, May 22nd, 1882.
LETTER No. 1.
To the Editor of the ? Christian World."
Sir, ? Such marvellously wide inquiry as to possibility of
help toward passage cost to the colonies, results from my
former letters in your universally read paper, that in behalf of
the many to whom the tidings will be particularly welcome, I
beg brief space again. This, for two or three reasons. First:
Christian World readers, amongst the classes referred to, are
usually thetype of character desirable in the colonies, and likely
to succeed, if there. Second : Through no other channel know
I how to reach many of them, and this, because your generous,
frank, and fair discussion and ventilation of the topic has turned
the eye of thousands interested to a weekly scrutiny of the
Christian World columns.
Queensland is now giving free passages to female domestic
servants and genuine farm labourer s, single and married, but
with limited number of children under 12. Assistance is given
to Blacksmiths, Carpenters, Wheelwrights, Shipbuilders, Masons,
Sawyers, Engineers, and the like.* I will afford particulars and
furnish pamphlet on receipt of stamp for reply. Queensland is
eleven times larger than England, and a population for the whole
area less than a town like Leeds. Large extent of seaboard,


mineral wealth, fertile soil, and forceful climate, with abundant
employment and high rate of wages, it is an attractive emigration
held, lor a subsequent issue, by your kind permission, I will
pen a few salient facts as to this promising colony.
Emigration is more and more thrust on the attention of social
philanthropists, and demands the gravest study from those who
look below the surface of present day forces ; as for the large
number of middle-class English families, as well as our working
men, the happiest, healthiest, and most hopeful outlet and redemption
is inlands across the seas. The prescience which gives a prom-
inent place to judicious and discriminate advocacy, statement,
and inquiry on this topic in a religious weekly devoted to the weal
Of the whole human family will he early admitted on all hands
So profoundly believing in its beneficent issues, and increasingly
occupied in its service, I know not but it may prove my
absorbing life-work. At your readers? service on this matter.?
Yours sincerely,
T , _ . , . JOHN H. WHITE.

LETTER No. 2.
To the Editor of the ? Christian World.?
Sir,?Redeeming promise in recent issue, I gladly put your
readers in possession of information touching this busy British
colony. Situate north-east of the Australian Continent, it has
2,250 miles ot seaboard, and over 420,000,000 acres of land.
This, equally divided means 12 acrcSbach for every man, woman,
and child in the three Kingdoms. Could we have them shot
down amongst us it would be the best ? Land Act ? we could
desire, and do much for this growing nation, which cries more
and more, Give place that we may dwell.? If, however, we
cannot have the land brought to us, we can do what is, perhaps,
better, ourselves go to the land. And your readers will ask what
then r Let ? stubborn facts ? reply. The climate is favorable to
life, the death-rate being better than ours, for 17 years past
averaging only 18 per 1,000. Though warmer than Britain, its
heat has no touch of languor, the absence of humidity making
it easily endurable. Its aridity saves from both the sickness and
loss of energy supposed to accompany residence in hot latitudes


In so mild a climate the settler has no need to spend much
time about a substantial and handsome dwelling. Real comfort
and necessary shelter are compassed quickly with economy and
ease. The land is found suitable for the pram and fruit of
England in one part, and the products of .the Indies in another.
Bunches of grapes, weighing to 71b., abound in the south and
south-west. Wheat, Mangold Wurzel, Potatoes, Apples, Goose-
berries, and Strawberries are raised among the southern highlands
of the Darling Downs Elsewhere are grown Maize (which is
the staple crop of Queensland), Cassava, Arrowroot (much
consumed, and produced for 2d. or 3d. per lb.), Tapioca, Cocoa-
nut Chicory, Rice, Cotton, Coffee, Tea, Sugar, Oranges, Peaches,
Bananas, Dates, Mangoes, Pine-apples &c? &c. No place can
beat Queensland for fruits. It will be seen that the producer
in this colony has rich choice of industry. Thirty farmers of
Allora one year averaged 38 bushels of wheat to the acre a yield
above the average, but indicative of possibilities. The fertility
of the soil will be manifest when it is noted that some trees run
up 300 feet. Sugar is thought to be the prospective industry.
Freezing and tinning works are being erected on a considerable
scale for the export of meat, of which the supply is almost
unlimited. At the close of 1876 Queensland had million sheep
and two million head of cattle. Forty times as many sheep to
population as in these islands! At great expense we convey
the tinned meat to the consumer; is not the better plan to take
the mouths where the mutton is? Wool is a very profitable
product. Its export in 1876 reached value nearly 1| millions
sterling. Skins which once were all exported are now in part
made into leather at home, and the tallow manufactured into
soap and candles, multiplies avenues for the industry of the
toiler and the capital of the wealthy. No colony has so large
a surface of grass land as Queensland, but irrigation is necessary
for successful grazing in many districts, some dams for storing,
already constructed, having cost each �2,000. Scope, room, and
opportunity for Britain?s sons and daughters are what these
colonies afford, while here?parents being witnesses ?crowds,
competition, and increasing difficulty are the order of the day.
Another week I will conclude, if possible, this bnefest outlining
of Queensland field of possibility and promise, and remain, sir,
yours truly, JOHN H. WHITE,
Laceby, near Grimsby, September sth, 1881.
See Note B.


f? P.S.?The hundreds who have written me this last fortnight,
and others who may do so, must kindly pardon, in some
instances, a brief but unavoidable delay in reply. The Agent-
General of Queensland writes me that young single women are
in urgent request in that colony, obtain immediate employment
and good wages. The present opportunity of free passage should
be widely availed of. Let me say in response to inquiry of
correspondents that further contribution to your columns
of data respecting this colony shall be shortly forthcoming.
Pressure of correspondence has compelled delay. To-day?s Daily
Neivs confirms all favourable testimony as to agricultural and
commercial prospects in Queensland.
LETTER No. 3.
To the. Editor of the ? Christian World."
Sir, ?Apology is due from me because of delay in completed
outline re Queensland. Correspondence pressure compels it.
Of the practical use of your columns some idea may be had
when I state that a small circle of single young women are just
gone out by s.s. Durham, and a party of 44 are grouped to-
gether to proceed by British Consul, November 10th, as a result
of correspondence from readers of the Christian World. These
include two local preachers, most are members of Christian
churches, and it augurs well for the moral issues to the colony
that through influence of religious Press such a class of Govern-
ment-assisted emigrants are being obtained. Your correspondent
? A.C.,? from New Zealand, may take heart. Moral as well as
muscular fibre is being introduced to found the new nations
which are destined to wield power and influence in days to
come. Not less mutually the emigrants themselves
is this Christian association of them ?a work whose operations
I hope to continue and enlarge.
By Roman Empire to Auckland, New Zealand, on the 13th,
some tw r enty were grouped. By the Orient steamers too, I have
almost regularly, clients placed in association. Two Wesleyan
ladies go out saloon by the Merope to Canterbury, November
20th, and letters reaching me indicate numerous further oppor-
tunities of successfully organising circles of kindred spirits for the
passage out. ?A.C.,? - ' last week, bears strong testimony to the
value of the service I am being enabled to render in that strange


sentence of his, ? The social and moral tone of what I must call
the victims of the emigration illusion have become sadly lowered.
lam sorry?profoundly so?to hear of ?victims of emigration
illusion.? There ought to be no ?illusion? in the matter, nor
need there be. The rightly adapted at the right season to the
right field do well to go. The one thing is to make known the
facts ?facts about climate, soil, government, industries, labour
demand and value, and to see that emigrants are well advised
as to their own mental, moral, manual, and physical fitness for
the undertaking From several of my former clients I had
colonial letters on Saturday, all satisfied, and I fail to discover any
victims of illusion amongst those who went forth at my counsel.
True 1 dissuade many, and deem this not the least important
duty pe-taining to real and true emigration promotion.
Disappointed emigrants are a public calamity, and I question
whether some rosy writers who once extolled emigration as the
universal panacea, and now decry it with the same intensity of
extravagant statement, are not themselves responsible that there
are so many. Still willing to faithfully counsel and help all who
write me on the subject.
Faithfully yours,
JOHN H. WHITE.

pg. Promised Queensland contribution shall be sent first

series with a similar one, giving condensed and official state-
ments of facts respecting the neighbouring colonyof New South
Wales.
LETTER No. 4.
To the Editor of the f ? Christian World ?
g IR> My last dealt with area, climate, and productions of this
land of promise. The history of its hitherto rapid progress is
striking and indicative. In fact, when the changes which have
come over any one of these new colonies is realized, as well as
the brief period in which they have occurred, it would seem as if
Arabian tales were outdone in marvel, and ?Aladdin?s lamp? the
possession of any man brave enough to become an emigrant. In
1841 the commerce of Brisbane was carried on by a small cutter


trading to Sydney; but in 1879, 1,261 vessels entered the port,
with over half a million aggregate tonnage, and crews of 42,260
men. A few squatters, perhaps a dozen store keepers in Brisbane
and Ipswich, and half-a-dozen Government officials, comprised
the population. Now Brisbane City alone, numbers more than.
30,000, and the colony some quarter of a million. Its exports
and imports, taken together, have risen from less than a million
and a quarter in 1860 to millions in 1878. Up to 1870 rail-
ways were in their infancy; in 1878 some 400 miles were working,
and a similar length in progi?ess. The opening of the interior
goes on in ever-accelerating ratio, and surveys lately taken for a
trans-continental railway, with last telegraphic reports of General
Feilding?s expedition, point to prospective advances which shall
quickly dwarf past progress into comparative insignificance.
The meat-freezing industry, destined to revolutionise our British
meat supply, and to attain fabulous and amazing proportions, will
attract capital, promote pastoral extension, and afford in the next
few years many a settler the means of quietly amassing sub-
stantial fortune. This the more as ?beef, mutton, hides, and
tallow, ?as one has said, ?walk to market on their own legs at
comparatively trifling cost to producer.? Already the Queens-
land Meat Freezing Company?s machinery is freezing at the rate
of 300 sheep per day, and a number of cattle besides ! Who fore-
sees the foi?ce of a fact like this is a seer of visions indeed.
Emigration has been reckoned a last resource, a dire necessity in
the past; hut to-days transitions are making it truly understood
as an opportunity, for which to be fitted, is the best of befalling
fortune.
The land regulations of the colony offer settlers peculiar advan-
tages. The Homestead Selection system favors the settlement
of small farmers with limited capital, and is very successful.
Conditional on personal residence, the Homestead selector pays
but sixpence a year per acre for 5 years, and can so become
the possessor of 80 acres of the best agricultural land. A second
system, called the Conditional Purchase Selection, permits pur-
chase of from 40 to 6,120 acres, Is. per acre being payable
annually for 10 years, personal residence not compulsory. Under
both systems certain improvements to the value of 10s. per acre
must be made. These are as much in the interest of the
purchaser, as the colony, and ensures the settler that surrounding
properties shall contribute fairly to local development, and not
be held merely by speculative capitalists (a great evil in some


colonies), whileindusfrious neighbours have raised its value, with-
out cost, toil, nr outlay to the owner When several persons seek
the same selection it is put up to auction at the Government
upset price of 10s. or 2s. 6d., according to the system, and
sold to the highest bidder. Nearly one million acres were thus
settled in 1877. The Colony is divided into 30 land districts.
Of mineral wealth, Queensland has a splendid inheritance.
Rich and extensive deposits of gold, copper, and iron have been
found. Coal has been discovered in nearly all districts where
sought for. Tin and antimony mines are worked in various
localities. Two years ago it was estimated that 9,000 gold-
miners were at work, and gold produced was valued slightly over
one million pounds sterling. The utilising of mineral riches is,
however mainly in prospect, and waits railway development,
skilled labour, and introduction of capital ?all in the near future.
Excellent Granite, Marble, Slate, Limestone, and even Diamonds,
Sapphires, Topazes, Sardonynx, Agates, and other precious
stones are found in considerable abundance.
Industrial prospects will be known best by quoting the official
summary of average rate of wages in Queensland : Plumbers,
Blacksmiths, Bookbinders, Brass-founders, Shipwrights, Masons,
Carpenters, Wheelwrights, Bricklayers, Tailors, Whitesmiths, earn
from 10s. to 12s. per day; Shoemakers, and Painters, 95.; Quarry-
men, Bs.; Carters, Brickmakers, and Labourers, 7s.
Farm labourers and Shepherds get �4O to �5O per year, with
board and lodgings ; bakers and sawyers, �5O to �00; cooks,
�4O to �5O; house-maids, �25 to �3O; waitresses, �3O to �35;
general servants, �3O to �4O ; butchers, 80s. to 355. weekly, with
rations; seamen, �4 to �6 monthly; compositors, Is. 6d. per
1,000. With such -wages ruling across the sea, it is an anomaly
and a disgrace that am 1 able-bodied, industrious artizan should
be without work, or at a loss to keep ? the wolf from the door.?
Facts must be made more widely known, till it is patent that each
man, the knife of enterprise in hand, may for himself bravely use
the poet?s words, and say, ? The world?s mine oyster.?
Facilities for reaching Queensland are many. A monthly
service of direct mail steamers, and frequently ] lying first-class
clipper ships, give passengers the option of wind or steam.
Those who cannot pay full passage cost may avail themselves
of the system of Government free and assisted passages now
in operation. Suffice it to say of these ?farm labourers, single


and married, domestic servants, housekeepers, and dressmakers,
are taken free, total cost being �1 each for ship kit, and a
reduced railway fare to join vessel at Plymouth. Approved
artizans pay from �2 to �7 per adult, according to sex and
age of family in addition to railway fare.
As yet my description relates to physical and material
conditions. What of the mental, moral, and social remains
an important question. In answer, education is free, compulsory,
and secular. An admirable system of national schools is provided
by which children of all classes are educated at the expense of the
State. Yearly competitive examination entitles successful
scholars to a three years? free education at grammar schools,
from which again the students have a chance of winning uni-
versity honours, and the best of them three years university
education, so that proved ability may rise from the ranks to
the highest of intellectual positions. State aid is given to no
Church, and, as might be expected, this acts as an incentive
to liberality and zeal. Hence all the Churches are well repre-
sented, and churches and chapels are numerous, springing up
in even the bush townships so soon as the population reaches
a few score. The colony has over 40 newspapers. There are
also mechanics? institutes, free libraries, and schools of art.
Questioning may arise in some minds as to the morality
of the Polynesian labour traffic, which is under supervision of
the Queensland Government. The merits of the whole question
it were well to discuss, as only by such means can we gain
evidence to pronounce on them. It may interest your humane
readers to know that I have had correspondence with the Agent-
General for Queensland, on the topic, and the following are
extracts therefrom: ??The Queensland Government and
Legislature have taken every possible precaution that no injustice
shall be inflicted on islanders hired to carry on tropical cultiva-
tion in Queensland. The simple question is, Are the natives of
friendly islands to be debarred an honest livelihood, and
partaking advantages of contact with civilization, because the
natives of other islands are addicted to murder and canni-
balism ? I answer, emphatically, No! and must add that if
people choose to venture among a horde of blood-thirsty savages,
without taking ordinary precautions, they mu-t abide the conse-
quences of their own rashness. The interests of the coloured
labourers in Queensland are well attended to by a large
proportion of the general community, by the Legislature, and by


the Government I have the honour to represent.? Clear it is
that to ensure colonial government being at once humane and
Christian, the best of all policy is to introduce to colonial
citizenship men of conscience, judgment, and character. Perhaps
one of the quickest ways to hasten the coming of the Redeemer?s
Kingdom on the earth, is for British Christianity to send her
sons to colonise and to permeate young and rising nationalities,
with the principles of truth, freedom and righteousness. ? The
salt of the earth ? was more than a phrase, and your kindly
given publicity to emigration opportunity to men of probity,
energy, and bravery, is a service well befitting the Christian
World, and in the very spirit, genius and fulfilment of the words,
just quoted.
One more statistic and I close. Of 90,000 emigrants to
Queensland, only 25,000 were females. It cannot be too
strongly emphasised that the ? better half ? of humanity is in
pressing and constant request. Here, oft driven to straits for
purity and honesty of life; there, occupancy, high wages, and
home life with all its attendant honours and sacredness, are at
easy command. Britain?s comely daughters, who aspire to this
high ministry should hear the colonial call, ? Come over and
help us.? ( See Note G.)
Next month a large circle of my clients are happily grouped.
This service of Christian association to all emigration fields and
for all classes I can more and more frequently render, and
will respond to all enquirers who send stamp for reply,
Faithfully yours,
JOHN H. WHITE.

LETTER No. 5.
To the Editor of the ? Christian World.?
g IBj gad *?A Colonist? been accurate observer enough he


would scarcely have so far erred as to attribute ??joke? or
?sarcasm? in my writing on this topic. Your readers well know
my advocacy of emigration of the rightly adapted, is earnest and
enthusiastic, and that, because profoundly convinced of the benefi-
cence of international, individual, and permanent issues. That
it should be better organised ?the weak and the false in its
processes eliminated ?is, in my judgment, what is wanted to
redeem it from the ill-repute in which it is held. For this I
am glad to know many of us are hopefully and persistently
working to-day. Kindly, truthful criticism will aid us, and I
will thank ?A Colonist? with all my heart if he will unsparingly
show up the faults of the systems which may be pursued,
because their exposure and abolition, will be a truly helpful
philanthropy, But to quarrel with female emigration seems to
me a grave mistake, and Ido not say this without reason. While
New Zealand gave free passages I had the pleasure of sending
several hundred domestic servants some six years ago, and, from
their own testimony, without any exception, with the happiest
results. A large majority of them have since married, and are
in homes of their own. This satisfactory outcome is, in great
part, owing to careful and stringent selection, and vindicates
the present endeavour, by means of Christian World channels,
on the part of the Queensland Government, to reach those whose
intelligence and character will double their colonial chances, and
go far to secure their highest moral interests. ?A Colonist
himself admits that ?the good servants soon obtain situations,?
and it should be positively known none others are.wanted.
As to the order and discipline of ship-life, it is essential for
the good of all, and will be no cause of complaint to well-
ordered minds. I enclose you the original of a letter from
the Plymouth Depot from a housemaid written last week, (See
Note E.) She says : ?We found everything very clean, and are
very happy .... there are some very nice girls.? The writer
has held some good situations in this country, and is well
connected. Home sickness in the first year is natural, and the
girl is not to be envied nor desired who would cast no look of
longing to the old land. Herein often lies the heroism of emigra-
tion. Freedom from temptation in its fiercest strength, is a
deliverance worth attempting. The hundreds of letters I have
received, telling of unsuccessful search of employment, have
filled my heart with pity, and the more when I have been ap-
pealed to for sempstresses in our large towns, as of such an one.


a gentleman in Bristol wrote me ?? She is thrown on the most
chance pittance, and has not a relative or friend in the whole
place. I have helped her what little I could, hut fear, that,
unless something can be done quickly, she will either starve, or
come to that last alternative which so many of our poor ruined
English girls have reached.? I quote this specimen, that it may
be known I have not drawn upon imagination for my statements,
Alas ! it is not couleur de rose at home ; and were the wretched-
ness and depth of immorality amongst our helpless and forsaken
poor as much revealed as the rollicking wickedness of the
colonies, which is proverbially on the face, there would be no
room left probably for comparison in favour of ourselves.
On December 17th, the Colonies and India reported the arrival
of the Almora mail steamer with emigrants, at Brisbane, and
said, ? The arrangements for their accommodation are perfect.?
The Government arrangements reduce to a minimum the inevit-
able difficulty and discomfort attending a sea-voyage not first
class, and those who have the bravery and enterprize to run the
gauntlet will find health, experience, maturity of character
result therefrom, and years hence, in their own colonial home do
anything but wish they had faintheartedly stayed behind.
? Look before you leap ? is an excellent proverb, but does not
? A Colonist ? translate it ? Never leap at all ??
Faithfully yours, John H. White.

NOTE A.
It will be interesting to know that subsequent advices enlarge
the list of occupations eligible for assistance ?E.G., Jan. 10th,
1882. The Agent-General advises me, ? Mechanics are urgently
needed. Carpenters, Masons, Blacksmiths, Bricklayers, Iron-
Workers, Brass-Moulders, find ready employment, at once, at
hifdi wao-es.? And on February 2nd. ? The advices from the
Colony are very encouraging as regards Female Domestic
Servants. At least 300 will be required monthly. The demand
for mechanics of all kinds is also in steady increase.?
Then on March 24th, after enumerating Carpenters, Blacksmiths,
Bricklayers, Iron-Moulders, Brass-Workers, Engineers, Fitters,
Colliers, the Agent General stated, ? The above classes are
certain of obtaining employment at high wages, as also Female
Domestic Servants.?

abiding benefits which Emigration ensures to & large s majc. y
British working-men ?of the imperative necessi yw u

After visiting the villages just recently whence I sent the emi-
grants of 1874, 1875, and 1876, and after making full enquiry of
relatives and friends, I have yet to learn of ONE of my sending,
who is now disappointed with colonial experience. The develope-
ment of my work in much wider degree, was caused by letter
which appeared in the ?Christian World ? of May 16th, 1879,
in which I proffered to answer any serious enquirrers who wrote
me enclosing stamp for reply. What followed will be learnt by
extract from letter of mine in ?Christian World? August 15th,
1879.
?When at your request in issue of May 9th, I penned a brief
letter of New Zealand facts, which appeared May 16th, I had no
dream of what would follow. For awhile in sheer kindliness I
was pleased to reply to those who applied to me, but as weeks
went by, and my correspondents became more serious and multi-
plied in number, I found it necessary to use the press, systematize
the whole thing, and have done so with this result?that I have
had to get help for my business, and set my whole time at liberty
for this duty. I have daily communication with shippers, both
sailing and steam. I have mutual arrangements with cabin fur-
nishers, and am now prepared to answer all enquiries about
colonial prospects. My shipping commissions form a remuner-
ation for my time and trouble, and the pleasure I feel in rendering
service, that will prove a long-life blessing in helping the over-
pressed to a freer life, in relieving the crowd, and lessening the
competition of English conditions, is a joy I cannot express.?
From this correspondence I have learned, that to the middle
classes of Britain, specially with growing families to educate and
start in life, emigration is as much an Heaven-sent deliverance,
as it is to our peasantry and from issues of it, in those instances
I have been privileged to counsel and learn result, I am sure the
days are quickly coming, when millions will avail of the wealth
of opportunity they may inherit thereby. Kindly guidance,
faithful helping in this direction is a new social mission to which
I have been irresistibly impelled in the light of scripture moni-
tion?? whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with all thy
might.?
It but remains to add that some 600 letters reach me monthly.
Heavy demands are made on my time by callers, and under
these circumstances, I am especially glad that a like-minded
brother in full sympathy with my work, has felt the call, and


seen his way to devote his life and energy to aid its tothef^
and promotion. ?We shall he helped to be helpful to others on
a larger scale hy all who will help us by kind commendation, and

Best and strongest confirmations as to Queensland s attractive-
ness as an Emigration Field, is found in the fact that applications
for assisted passages reach me almost daily from those who have
friends gone out in time past. Within a few hours, both correspon-
dents and callers have told me that the tidings they reserve
privately, more than confirm the good opinion my letters have
created in Queensland favour.

the generous and noble attitude which the ?Christian World
editorial columns uniformly bear toward emigration Them

publication.


From ?Notes by the Way ?in the ? Christian World," May 18 th, 1882,
'? While it is much to be deplored that the recent appeal to the Loan Mayor for help
in respect of Emigration, met with so meagre a response, some cheering signs of
interest and success are constantly appearing. Mr. John H. White, of Grimsby,
that ?in co-operation with one of our Colonial governments,? he ?sent
out (XX) Lincolnshire peasants, with large families and almost penniless, seven years
ago. He has not heard of ? one being dissapointed that went, but hundreds are left
dissapointed that did not go.?
ARTHUR CLAYDEN, in Writing to the Spectator from Nelson, New Zealand, on
tne subject of the Women?s Emigration Society,? says that ? the English agricultural
labourer in that colony, instead of vegetating in an English shire at 12s. n week is owner
� r a vegetable farm, bringing him in at least �5 a-week, all the year round,?
ana adds. So it may be with the sadly ill-paid and badly-placed middle-class women
or English society. Give to those magnificent colonies,? says the writer, ? good mothers,
glory of England, and I see no limit to their future grandeur.? It should also be
noted that the announcement lately made of a grant by the PREMIER of �lOO from the
Special Service Fund to Mr. G. J. HOLYOAKE, ?in order to visit America to report
on Co-operation, was erroniously described. The grant is to enable him to prosecute
s enquiries in America and Canada in connection with the emigration of operatives.
