The Antelope is a native
of Africa and Mexico. They
are of a most active make.

sition, extremely watchful,
of great vivacity, and re-

What is very singular, is
that they will stop in the

moment, gaze at their pursu-
ers, and then resume their
flight. The chase of these
animals is a favourite diver-
sion of the Eastern nations.
They are said to form herds
as large as two or three thou-
sand, and generally reside in
hilly countries.

Though extremely useful
in destroying vermin, the cat
seems more attached to the
house than to the persons in
it; and frequent instances
occur of their return to the
place from whence they have

been carried, though at ma-
ny miles distance, and even
across rivers, when one
might suppose they could
have no knowledge of the
Toad or way that would lead
them to it. Some people
suppose that cats can see in
the dark, but it is not so in
reality; though it is certain
they can see with a less de-
gree of light than most other
animals. The eves of kit-
%s
tens remain closed for some
days after they are born,
which is the case with all
animals that lap.

Of all animals, the dog is
the most faithful and saga-
cious. There are few things,
which he may not be taught
to serve his master; and if
he be well used, there are
fewer still that he will not

and daily prove faithful

year, and generally produces
eight young at a time; so
that, if frequent reductions
were not made in various
ways, there is reason to ap-
prehend they would soon ex-
ceed the means of their sup-
port, and over-run the face
of the country. But as their
increase is great, so is the
number of their enemies; for
besides those that are taken
for the use of man, great
numbers are devoured by
foxes, weasels, and other
beasts of prey. In Spain,
they formerly increased to
such a degree, that the in-

Of these animals there is

they make nearer approach-

es to the human species, both
in form and action, than any
other class of quadrupeds.
They are found only in warm
climates, and chiefly in the
torrid zone. They are re-
markably lively and active,
full of chatter, grimace, and
mischief; they leap with
great activity from tree to
tree, even when loaded with
their young ones, which cling
to them.

This singular animal is a
native of New Holland. It
is of the opossom kind, hav-
ing, like that animal, a pouch
on the lower part of its belly,
in which it carries and suck-
les its young, of which it has

r but one at a time. It is about
as large as a sheep ; the fore
I legs are very short, scarcely
reaching to the nose, and
useless for walking; they are
I used in digging, burrowing in
the ground, and carrying
food to its mouth ; the hind
~ 7
legs are very long, and it
hops on them like a bird,

balancing itself with its vast
tail, making successive bounds
of ten or twelve feet with
such rapidity as to outstrip

also springs from rock to
rock, leaps over bushes sev-

apparent ease. The tail of
this animal is very long - , with
