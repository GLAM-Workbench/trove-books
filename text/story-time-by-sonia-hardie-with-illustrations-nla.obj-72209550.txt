FOLK
Do you believe in Fairy folk?
Why, surely, sure, you do!
?Cos, when I?m down in Fairyland,
I hear them talk of you.
Do you believe in Fairy folk?
You know the kind I mean;
With magic wands and fairy wings,
The sweetest ever seen.
Do you believe in Fairy folk?
I?m sorry if you don?t;
Of course I know there may be some
Who shake their heads and won?t.
But surely you?re not one of these;
How very sad I?d be.
You do believe in Fairy folk,
The very same as me.


I DON?T CARE
One day I took a long long walk
Around the countryside,
And when I sat awhile to rest,
A little man I spied.
His clothes, they hung all old and torn;
His beard was long and grey;
And from his boots his toes peeped out
In just the coldest way.
I said, ?What ails you, little man?
What is the grief you bear??
He raised his head, and then he said,
?They call me 1 don?t care.?
?Why, what a funny name to have!
I?ve heard of Smith and Brown,
But never heard of I don?t care
In this my native town.?
?Now listen.? said this sad old man,
As down by me he sat:
?I?ll tell you all about myself,
And why they call me that.


?When I was just a little boy,
I never could be nice;
I?d always say, ?oh, I don?t care,?
Not once, or even twice.
?I?d say it if my sums were wrong,
Or if my shoelace broke,
To mother, father, teacher too,
And lots of other folk.
?I didn?t care, I didn?t care.
My temper made me say:
But really, truly, in my mind,
I did care, in a way.
?The Fairy Folks, they got to know;
One day their Queen so fair,
She touched me with her wand and said,
?Your name is I DON?T CARE.
? ?And you must wander through the land
For many a long long year,
Until you prove by word and deed
You?ve learned at last to care.? ?


THE ZOO
AT HOME
Suppose there were no zoo at all,
We should not find it hard.
?Cos we could keep such lovely things
?Way down in our back yard.
For you could have a tiger wild,
And I a kangaroo;
And you could keep a lion bold,
And I a bear or two.
I think the boys and girls we know
Would love to form a band,
And plan a way that we could have
Some elephants on hand.
And ?cos we have a lot of space,
I?d take the ?potamus?
That?s if he?d promise to be good
And never make a fuss.


So, when we?ve got it all arranged,
We shall not want a zoo;
If I would pat a tiger bold,
I?d come and visit you.
Or should you want to see a bear
And hear a growl or so,
You?ll find them, if you care to step
In my backyard, you know.
Then right away, on dusty day,
We?d never have to roam,
If we can just adopt this plan
And keep the zoo at home.


THE FAIRY'S LITTLE DAUGHTER
The Fairy?s little daughter
Was wrapped up in her shawl
And taken by her mummie
?Way to the Fairies? Ball.
And when the other Fairies
Were tripping on their toes,
She rocked her little daughter
To bye-byes in a rose.
And then she joined the dancing:
With laughter sweet and gay
Those happy little Fairies
Danced all the night away.


The Fairy?s little daughter
Within the rose so red
Slept on all warm and cosy,
With petals round her head.
Her mummie quite forgot her
When home at last she sped,
Until she saw before her
The baby?s empty bed.
Ah! how she cried with sorrow!
?My babjr?s lost,? she said;
?I left her sweetly sleeping
Within a rose so red.?
The Fairy?s little daughter
Had wakened with the morn;
She missed her fairy mummie
And raised a cry forlorn.
A Pixie fellow heard her,
He found the rose so red,
And carefully he raised her
From out her cosy bed.
He took her back to mummie,
No more to be apart,
A happy baby Fairy
Held close to mummie?s heart.


MY PARTY
What lovely fun has come my way!
A party I?m to have to-day,
With pretty dresses, lovely curls,
And lots and lots of boys and girls,
With jellies, cakes, and lollies too.
I wish you weren?t grown up, don?t
It can?t be nice to be so tall;
You seem to have no fun at all.
Five candles on the birthday cake,
A sum of all my years they make;
And did you hear my mummie say,
The first piece I can cut to-day.
We?re going to ask my dollies, too,
I think it?s only right, don?t you?
They?d feel so sad to be left out
While such a party was about.


And my dear Teddy, do you know,
I?ve bought him such a lovely bow;
He?ll sit up like a soldier straight,
So mind you don?t forget bis plate.
I?m sorry you?ve grown up so tall;
For see, I?d love to ask you all;
I don?t think you?re too old to play,
So come along to my birthday.


HASTY HARRY
Hasty Harry couldn?t wait,
Wait till Christmas day,
For the things that Santa would
Leave him on his way.
When he went to bed that night,
On that Christmas Eve,
Even now to think of it
Makes him sigh and grieve.
?Stead of staying good in bed,
Falling fast asleep,
Hasty Harry, all agog,
Out of bed did creep.
?I?ll sit by the chimney side,?
Harry thought with glee;
?Then, becos? I?m wide awake,
Santa I shall see.?
Clock struck eight and clock struck nine,
Long and loud and deep;
Still that Hasty Harry chap
Never fell asleep.


Ah! what?s that? He heard a noise.
?Santa?s come,? said he;
Up the chimney put his head,
So that he could see.
Black soot fell down with a rush
On poor Harry?s head.
Spluttering and sneezing hard
Back he jumped to bed.
Soon to Dreamland he had gone,
And dear Santa Claus,
Creeping softly to his bed.
Wond?ringly did pause.
Shook his whiskers long and thick,
Fumbled in his sack;
Water-melon he must find,
?Cos the fellow?s black.
?Mother fellow got his train.
Hasty Harry woke;
All the people laughed at him,
Thought he was a joke.
When he washed the black stuff off
He was white again;
But the melon didn?t turn,
Turn into a train.
Hasty Harry, poor old chap,
All that day did weep.
Don?t be caught as he was, dears,
Mind you go to sleep.


DONTS
Those awful horrid things called don?ts,
Ah, how they worry me!
I?d like to make a heap of them
And throw them in the sea.
There?s such a dreadful lot of them,
A million?so I think;
How glad I?d be to see them go,
And watch them quickly sink!
Oh, how I know ?Don?t bang that door!?
I hear it ev?ry day;
And ?Don?t you sit on that cold floor!?
Each time I want to play.
And ?Don?t you make your brother cry;
Don?t stamp those noisy feet;
Don?t climb that tree; don?t answer me;
Don?t have too much to eat.
?Don?t dirty all your Sunday clothes;
Don?t shout as loud as that;
Don?t bite your nails; and don?t tell tales;
And don?t annoy the cat.


?Don?t ever you be late for school;
Don?t dawdle on the way;
Don?t hit with sticks; don?t fight with bricks
Don?t have so much to say.?
Those awful horrid things called don?ts,
Oh, bow they worry me!
I?d love to make a heap of them
And throw them in the sea.

THE WRONG SIDE OF THE BED
Has mummie ever looked at you.
And, smiling, has she said,
?It seems to me that you got out
The wrong side of the bed.??
The two sides of the bed, you know,
Are diff?rent as can be,
Altho? I s?pose they look alike
To you as well as me.
Now, if you jump out when you?re called,
Nor wait because it?s cold,
Why, that?s the right side, sure enough,
Or so I?ve oft been told.
The right side of the bed leads on,
Throughout the sunny day,
To lessons learned and sums all right.
And lots of lovely play.
They keep a store of picnics gay,
And parties, so it?s said,
And you will find them stored away
The right side of the bed.
But if there comes a day along
When mummie calls you twice,
And you don?t answer, ?cos you think
The bedclothes feel too nice;


You stay in bed till you are late,
You?re such a sleepy-head,
You may be sure that you?ll get out
The wrong side of the bed.
The little growls and little snarls
Are waiting for you there;
Your shoe-lace breaks, you lose your hat,
There?s big knots in your hair.
Your porridge burns your poor old mouth,
You fall and hurt your knees.
You?re late for school, and as a rule,
It rains so dismally.
So mind and do the proper thing;
Think o?er the things I?ve said;
And try to always jump out quick,
The right side of the bed.

ETHELBERTRAM EASY-GLOW
Ethelbertram Easy-Glow
Had a shiny nose, and so,
?Cos he was a trifle proud,
Loathed to mingle with the crowd.
Naughty little boys would shout,
If they saw him round about:
Follow in a dancing line,
Shouting: ?How your nose does shine!?
Ethelbertram Easy-Glow
Many doctors got to know,
But he found it plain to see
None could cure his malady.
So he drooped, and sad he grew;
Friends were very far and few.
?Ah,? he thought, ?I?d get on fine,
If my nose refused to shine.?


One night, at his cottage small
An old witch-woman chanced to call;
Ethelbertram Easy-Glow
Told her all his tale of woe.
Very still she sat and straight.
While he told of his sad fate.
Then she rose, and him assured
That he really could be cured.
?Put your little shiny nose
In the ground where garden grows;
Keep it there for one whole week;
That will cure your shining beak.?
Ethelbertram Easy-Glow
Fell upon his knees, and so
Thanked the witch in joyous tone:
Said: ?My wealth shall be your own.
Right out in the garden fair?
Ethelbertram lay out there,
Heedless of the snail or fly,
Till a week had passed him by.
Then he rose, all glad and gay,
And rejoicing went his way.
Till he found?ah, Fate was hard!?
In that week?t had grown a yard.


AMANDA MAY
I have a little dolly,
Her name?s Amanda May,
And really how I love her,
It?s more than words can say.
She?s very old and tattered;
She?s only got one arm;
I?ll tell you what that bad dog did,
That Binkie, on the farm.
When she was young and pretty,
I put her out one day,
All tucked up in her little cot,
While I went out to play.
For shame, that awful Binkie,
He dragged her down the yard;
He pulled her hair off and her arm
I cried and cried so hard.
And now I love her best of all;
She needs it, don?t you see?
?Cos she?s the poorest of the lot,
She means the most to me.


If I had the pussy-cat?s big fur coat,
I?d walk on the coldest day;
I should never need stamp my feet
To frighten Jack Frost away.
If I had the birdies? two fine wings,
I?d sail on the wind and fly,
Nor rest till I reached the bluest bit,
Of the lovely big blue sky.
But the pussy-cat?s coat and the birdies wings,
They were never made for me,
But I?ve got a ship, and a great big train,
And a swing in the apple-tree.


THE GIRL NEXT DOOR
The girl who lives next door to me
Has dollies and a pram;
And when she says, ?Come over here,?
How very glad I am!
I take along my Teddy Bear,
And poor Amanda May
(I told you what a dear she was,
Upon another day).
We do some gambols on the lawn;
The dollies just look on;
They re stiff in all their joints, you know.
And cannot join the fun.
And then we take them for a walk,
All dressed up in their best;
And when we?re back we lay them down
And make them take a rest.


We give them tea in little cups
(They think it?s tea, you know,)
It?s only water from the tap,
They do enjoy it so.
And then we put their nighties on,
For stars begin to peep;
And when my mummie calls me in.
Those dolls are fast asleep.

WINNIE?S PINNY
My friend Winnie
Has a lovely pinny,
Her Ma bought it
Down the street.
I said ?Winnie,
Let me see your pinny;?
I ran to her
With quick feet.
?Look,? said Winnie,
?How d? you like my pinny??
Fairies walk around the top:
Imps and Pixies
Round that pinny
Skip and hop.


When my Mother
Took me and my brother
For a walk right down the street,
I said, ?Winnie
Has a lovely pinny?
Lovliest pinny
You could meet.?
So my Mother
Took me and my brother
To the shop where Winnie?s Ma
For her Winnie
Bought the pinny:
Now I?ve got one,
HIP HURRAH!


A FAIRY WAND
I wish I had a fairy wand,
A magic one, I mean;
I d wish to go to many lands
That I have never seen.
I wish I had a fairy wand;
I?d hold it in my hand;
Then everything in all the world
Would be at my command.
I always try to pick one up;
I haven?t seen a sign
Of one that?s lying on the ground,
Just waiting to be mine.
I?d love to have a fairy wand;
Now, could you tell me true
The very place where they are found?
I?d bring one back for you.


THE WEDDING
They met in a toy-shop
A long time ago?
Yes, right in the window
Where they were for show.
And she was a dolly
With curls and blue eyes,
Her dress caused the others
Most envious sighs.
Stood in a brown box,
Looked charming and fair,
Among big and small dolls
The loveliest there.
Her name was Priscilla
Nell Rosamund Joan;
She set girlies longing
To call her their own.
And he was a Golly
With smile wide and big;
Such rows of white buttons
And fuzziest wig!
A coat made of blue stuff,
His trousers of red,
And nothing to cover
His woolly black head.
It was love at first sighting;
He stood at her side
And whispered, ?Priscilla,
Please be my dear bride.
The Queen of the Fairies
Will marry us now.?
He bent his head forward
In stateliest bow.


So coy was Priscilla,
Her whisper was low:
?Oh, bravest of Gollies,
I do love you so.
But what if we?re sold, dear,
For ever to part
I think, dearest Golly,
?Twould just break my heart
The good Queen of Fairies
Said ?Never you fear;
Your two hearts so loving
Shall always be near.
And nothing shall part you,
?it?s true what I say?
My blessing be on you
For ever and aye.?
They met in a toy-shop
One glad Christmas tide,
And now dear Priscilla?s
The Gollywog?s bride.


OUR PHOTOS
We hope you like our photos,
We?re sitting on a log,
And all the party you can see,
Except our naughty dog.
He wouldn?t face the camera,
We coaxed him, all in vain;
He?s run a long way down the
And won?t come back again.
road,
He?s all for chasing bunnies,
He can?t sit still, like us;
And if you try and hold him,
He makes an awful fuss.
P?raps when he?s not looking,
Some sunny day, maybe,
We?ll get a lovely snap of him,
Our doggie then you?ll see.


A-TISH-OO
?Tish-oo man, he made me sneeze.
Set my eyes a-crying:
Can?t get up and go and play,
In my bed I?m lying.
Medicine and nasty oil,
That?s what I?ve been drinking:
?Tish-oo man, he made me sneeze.
Set my eyes a-blinking.
Mummie says I must be still,
But it?s dull and dreary:
Staring at the ceiling makes
Anybody weary.
Skipping-rope and whipping-top,
Wonder what they?re saying:
?Wish that girl was out with us,
In the garden playing.?
I can hear old Shiver Wind
What a noise he?s making
Round and round about the house.
All the windows shaking!


?Tish-oo man rides on his back,
With his store of sneezes:
Counts them out to boys and girls?
Laughs at all their wheezes.
?Tish-oo man, A-tish-oo man,
Summer soon will chase you;
Right away, right far away
She will quickly race you.
Shiver Wind won?t blow again.
When the summer meets us:
?Tish-oo man, you won?t be here,
When the sunshine greets us.
Wish I could get up and play!
?Tish-oo man, he found me:
Made me stop right here in bed,
With the blankets round me.


LET?S PRETEND
Let?s pretend that I am King,
And you my boldest knight:
At gleam o? dawn we ride away,
Away to win the fight.
Foes are strong, but we are brave;
Upon out trusty steeds
On we gallop like the wind;
Look, see the King, he leads.
Back we ride, and in the town
The flags are flying high:
Hear the band so gaily play
As we go riding by.
Let?s pretend, ah, let?s pretend
That we are sailors bold:
On the ocean wild and deep
The winds are blowing cold.


Each and ev?ry man his post;
The waves are dashing high:
Pray we guide her through the storm;
The cruel rocks are nigh.
Storm is over, we are safe,
The water?s calm and blue:
Here?s three cheers, three mighty cheers,
For all the gallant crew.
Let?s pretend we?re Indians,
So savage, wild, and free:
Feathered headdress all complete,
Such warlike braves are we.
Sit by campfires burning bright,
While round the shadows creep,
Telling tales of great deeds done
When all the world?s asleep.
Let?s pretend, ah, let?s pretend
Beside the creek so cool;
We can play, thro? summer?s day,
Because there?s no more school
Do I hear the old bell ring?
Pretending time is o?er.
Dear old games, please wait for us
Outside the schoolhouse door.


LITTLE CHICKEN TIMOTHY
Little chicken Timothy
Never was content,
Sighed and grumbled dismally
Everywhere he went.
Farmyard wasn?t gay enough
For this flighty chick;
Everything was very slow;
Nothing happened quick.
Worried Mrs Clucking Hen
With his grumbly air,
Till she was ashamed of him?
Called him grizzly bear.
One fine day the Fairy Queen,
Flying to and fro,
Heard the chicken Timothy?s
Awful tale of woe.
Waved her wand above him,
Touched him on the leg.
Said, ?You?re just the bird I want
For an Easter egg.?
From a great big sugared egg
Timothy is peeping,
And the big tears, to his eyes
They are slowly creeping.


J*
How he?s wishing he was back,
In the farmyard playing!
?Hate this stuffy Easter egg,?
I can hear him saying.
?Fairy Queen, O, Fairy Queen,
I have learned my lesson,
I was peevish, sad, and cross,
That is my confession.
?Send me to the farmyard gay,
Back to sunshine yellow;
Quite contented I will stay,
Such a happy fellow.?
Fairy Queen said, ?Now you know,
Grumbles bring you sorrow;
Since you?ve learned your lesson, Tim,
You?ll go home to-morrow.?


THE DOLLY?S HOUSE
Great big bangings in the yard,
I?m glad as glad can be:
Daddy?s making, sure enough,
Dolly?s house for me.
Upstairs, downstairs, windows, doors,
Curtains, tables, too:
I will say to dolly soon,
?It?s made all for you.?
Time, to me it passes slow,
Daddy?s working hard:
Great big bangings, can?t you hear,
?Way down in the yard?
Roof and chimneys, side and front,
All take time and care:
When it?s done, we?ll have great fun,
Taking dolly there.


How excited she will be
When we show her through!
Upstairs, downstairs, windows, doors
Cup and saucers, too!
P?raps there?ll be a little stove
With some pans and pots;
So, when dolly feels inclined,
She?ll be cooking lots.
Wonder if she?ll give me some?
I love cakes, I do:
She might bake for fairy folk,
Pixie fellows, too.
Hurry up, dear Daddy, do!
Won?t we have some fun
When you tell me, some day soon.
That it?s really done!


THE FAULTLESS MISS
I know a model little miss
Who?s always neat and tidy;
She wears the selfsame dress all through
From Monday until Friday.
Her socks, they always stay up tight;
Her shoe-string?s neatly tied;
Her sunny head of little curls
Are mother?s joy and pride.
No milk or gravy does she spill,
To set them all a-sighing;
And, oh, the ribbons on her curls,
They never keep untying.
I haven?t heard her whimper once
When mother says, ?You?re weary.
Now say Good Night to ev?ry one,
And straight to bed, my dearie.?


If Sue should sit upon her chair,
She?d never scratch or beat her;
Oh, no, this model little miss
Would only smile the sweeter.
She never scrambles after cake,
She doesn?t scream for lollies,
She can?t do anything like that,
She?s just one of my dollies.


SANTA?S WIFE
Father Christmas has a wife?
Now, that?s news to you?
And, without her by his side,
What d?you think he?d do?
She sews all his buttons on,
Cooks him things to eat;
Next to Santa Claus himself.
She?s the one to meet.
She knows things that girlies love.
What can please a boy?
Though the baby?s only small,
Ne?er forgets his toy.
She helps Santa such a lot,
Reads his letters through,
Finds among the store of things
Something good for you.
Now they?re gone for holidays,
Santa and his wife;
In December, oh! they lead
Such a busy life!
Back they?re gone to Fairyland;
They?re as gay as gay;
For the Fairy Folk down there
Tell them what you say.


?Oh, how lovely! Oh, how sweet!?
Like some lovely chimes,
Echo on through Fairyland,
Many thousand times.
When some gift has pleased you well
(This is true as life),
While you?re thanking Santa Claus
Don?t forget his wife.


BETTY BELINDA
Betty Belinda Boronia Brice?
Oh, what a mouthful! you?d have to think twice,
Twice or p?raps three times, if you weren?t bright,
And then you can?t tell if you?ve said it quite right.
Betty Belinda Boronia Brice
Asked for the Queen of the Fairies? advice,
Told her quite gravely that it was a shame;
Honest to goodness, she?d tired of her name.
Betty Belinda?it sounded quite sweet,
Just long enough to tell people she?d meet.
But Betty Boronia Brice?
Somehow it sounded too long to be nice.
This sad little girl, with such a long name,
Thought some of her aunts were surely to blame;
They wanted her called by their own names, you see,
And couldn?t decide on which one she should be.


Her worried mamma, she stood by her cot,
And said, ?For peace sake we will call her the lot;
There?s nothing else for it, so this must suffice,
Betty Belinda Boronia Brice.?
The sweet Fairy Queen, so clever was she;
She said ?My child, they must all call you Bee;
It stands for them all, and it?s proper and nice,
Betty Belinda Boronia Brice.?


THE CHEER-UP MAN
you met the Cheer-Up Man
Round about the street?
Out of all the folk I know
He?s the man to meet.
Cheeks like rosy apples red;
Voice so full of glee:
Out of all the folk I know
He?s the man for me.
He drives all the tears away
In his magic style,
And the music of his voice
Coaxes back a smile.


Frowns all melt away like snow,
When they see him near
Growls and grumbles have no
place
In his life of cheer.
Happy little Cheer-Up Man,
Chasing all the sighs
Flushing in his jolly way
All our peevish cries.
Do not run away from us.
For we love you dear:
Wheresoever we may go,
We would have you near.
Have you met the Cheer-Up Man
Round about the street?
Out of all the folk I know
He?s the man to meet.


SHOPPING
Aren?t there lovely things to see?
Shops all full of lollies,
Creamy cakes for you and me,
Lots of gold-haired dollies.
Picture-books that Dad can read
When the tea is over,
All about some boys and girls
And their big dog Rover.
Trains that run along on lines,
With a key to wind them:
Stations, signals, everything,
In the box you?ll find them.
Big fat rubber balls that bounce.
Painted gay and jolly:
Tricycles and scooters here,
What a lovely trolly!


Now it?s getting dark as dark;
Home we must be popping,
With our parcels loaded up;
We have been out shopping.
Stop a minute while I see;
Here?s a box so jolly,
Filled all full with little clothes;
They?ll just fit my dolly.
When her birthday comes along?
It?s in next September?
We will buy that box for her;
Mind that you remember.
S?pose we take that bunny home
For our baby Mabel!
Mummie, see those lovely chairs
And that little table!
Wish I had a toyshop big;
Oh, the toys I?d tell them!
?Don?t go tempting people in,?
I?d just hate to sell them.


MY LESSONS
I?m only four, and so, you see,
To school I do not go;
But mummie tells me heaps of things
I have to learn to know.
There seems to be a dreadful lot,
And some days, yes, it?s true,
I just forget ?most everything
That good girls ought to do.
I leave my clothes all in a heap,
Without one tiny fold;
I never say, ?Excuse me, please,?
Without I?m being told.


And when my mummie calls to me,
I ought to answer quick.
And run and say, ?Yes, mummie dear,?
Right on the very tick.
But, do you know, I keep as still
And quiet as a mouse,
While my poor mummie looks for me
All up and down the house.
And mummies have a lot to do,
So girlies should be good
And try to be a little help;
Now, don?t you think they should?
So every night when I?m in bed
And mummie kisses me,
I whisper, ?When to-morrow comes
You see bow good I?ll be."

TOPSY-TURVY LAND
Now, mind you put your clothes on right;
Use careful eyes and hand;
Or maybe you will wake one night
In Topsy-Turvy Land.
The queerest place, you would agree,
If you should pass that way;
?Twould make you pause so wond?ringly?
The things they do and say.
They give you water when you feel
As hungry as can be,
And when they peal their dinner-bell,
It?s always time for tea.
They always sleep the whole day through,
And walk about all night,
And when Jack Frost turns noses blue,
They dress in raiment light.
But when the dear old sun shines out,
In all his splendour hot,
Those silly people walk about
In all the clothes they?ve got.


They say ?Good morning? when it?s night,
Those people are so queer;
And when they part, they murmur low,
?So pleased to meet you, dear!?
They eat their cake before their bread,
And, oh, the babies small
Learn first to walk upon their heads
Before they even crawl.
?My old umbrella I must bring,?
I heard one sadly say;
?I mustn?t go without the thing,
It?s so fine out, to-day.?
They put their clothes on inside out;
Use careful eyes and hand,
Or p?raps they?ll take you there to live.
In Topsy-Turvy Land.


JOE
I?m sure you?d love to know
My baby kitty Joe;
He?s black and white and fat.
And such a tiny cat.
He plays around all day,
And jumps about with glee;
The lady down the way,
She gave my Joe to me.
And when I call his name,
He runs right up to me.
And mews and mews and mews
Till I give him his tea.
He curls up in a ball
Each time he takes a nap,
And if I?m keeping still
He?ll sleep upon my lap.


Ji, III 1 1 ?111
But when he?s wide awake,
Around the kitchen floor
I drag a piece of string,
He?ll catch it with his paw.
And don?t we have some fun,
As round and round we go;
The piece of string and I,
And little kitty Joe?


DAVY
I?m just past Davy?s shoulder now,
He?s stronger far than me;
He jumps and fights and swims and runs.
But I?m a girl, you see.
He says that girls are always soft,
He says they?re babies, too,
And I?ll admit that he does things
That I could never do.
But sometimes he will play with me
At cricket on the lawn,
And when I miss he calls me just
The biggest booby born.
He never nurses dolls like me,
I?ve often begged him hard.
But he just says, ?I?m going to shoot
Some tigers in the yard.?
My brother?s eyes are big and brown,
And mine are only grey;
His hair is black and curls up tight
In just a lovely way.


And my hair has to go in rags,
If e?er I want a curl:
I should have had the curly hair,
?Cos I am just a girl.
I wouldn?t change him, no, not I;
Now listen, you?ll agree
That no one else in all the world
Could be so good to me.
When first I went to school I was
Afraid, and awful shy:
I hung my head and blinked so hard,
I nearly had to cry.
But Davy, he just whispered low,
?Now, don?t be frightened, dear,
And don?t feel lonely, sister mine;
Remember, I am here.?
I felt so proud to have him there,
I stroked a shiny curl,
And said, ? ?Cos you?re my brother, Dave,
It?s nice to be a girl.?


A PURPLE PUSSY-CAT
I?d love a purple pussy-cat,
The grey ones are so tame:
And as for black and whitey ones,
They always look the same.
But if I had a purple cat,
How lucky I should be,
For all the Kings and all the Queens
Would come to visit me!
They?d stand upon the step and say,
"Oh, may we see your cat?
We?ll walk in rows, and point our toes;
What do you think of that?


?We?d love to see your purple cat;
Do let us in your house;
For King Keeboo has brought a rat,
And I have brought a mouse.
?We?d only stroke him once or twice.
And give him just one pat:
Oh, let us in, please let us in,
To see your purple cat.?


THE PROBLEM
There was once a great professor
In a learned school I knew,
He was filled and crammed with knowledge,
Wiser far than I or you.
And the most perplexing problems?
He could solve them in a wink;
For this lucky gifted fellow
Never had to stop and think.
Well-belov?d he was, and sought for
By the highest in the land;
Why, a very King would hurry
Just to grasp his learned hand.


So he lived in great contentment,
In a wise and proper way,
Till, alas! a knotty problem
Drifted in his mind one day.
He was seated in his garden,
Gazing on his flowers fair;
Leaning back in great enjoyment,
He inhaled the fragrant air.
Then this awful question gripped him,
And no answer could he find,
As he sat there, sad and sighing,
While a horror filled his mind.
Is a caterpillar crawly
A relation to a cat?
Now this wisest of professors,
Why, he couldn?t answer that.
He employed his splendid brain-box
In the old accustomed way,
But that ornamental structure
Hadn?t anything to say.
Then he searched through musty volumes,
With the dust of ages clad,
But no mention of relations
Could he find to make him glad.
Is a caterpillar crawly
A relation to a cat?
Now this wisest of professors,
Why, he couldn?t answer that,


Till one day a fancy led him,
(Or a fairy?maybe so)
To the yellow sands inviting.
Where the little wavelets flow.
There he found a lovely sea-shell;
As he held it to his ear,
Ke could hear a voice within it,
Speaking wond?rous loud and clear.
And the words it spoke brought comfort
To this wise professor old,
And he valued it immensely
Like a bag of yellow gold.
For it said?and spoke right truly?
(Do you wonder, dear, at that?)
?Oh, a caterpillar crawly?s
No relation to a cat.?

MY DOG
Brown dogs, black dogs, dogs that snap and growl,
Big tall watch-dogs, dogs that cry and howl;
Dogs with spots on, and poodles soft and white
All walk past me, when I?m out at night.
My dog?s different, diff?rent as can be;
He goes with me, near and close to me,
Pit pat, pit pat, close up to my hand,
He?s the best dog, best in all the land.
My fun?s his fun, ev?ry time we meet;
We run races, up and down the street;
He?s just my dog, others run away;
He stays near me, now and ev?ry day.




ARAMINTA
Araminta Stiff-as-Starch,
Born the thirty-first of March;
Prim and proper from a child,
No one thought she?d ever smiled.
Ev?ry hair was in its place
?Neath her cap of snowy lace;
Never ran and shouted loud;
Walked with footsteps slow and proud.
Never loved the shining creek;
Never heard the flow?rets speak;
Never laughed with Jacky gay,
As he welcomed each new day.
Dearest Dear, a fairy maid,
Shivering and sore afraid,
Wandered through the bush one day?
Dearest Dear had lost her way?
Sad and drooping, hungry, cold.
Tangled was her hair of gold,
And her little nose was red,
?Cos of all the tears she?d shed.
Araminta Stiff-as-Starch,
Born the thirty-first of March,
Walking through the shady glade,
Met this little fairy maid.


To her prim and proper mind
Came a thought, so good and kind;
?Little maiden, looking sad,
I will try to make you glad.?
Took the little Dearest Dear
To her tiny cottage near,
Set before her food to eat,
Bread and milk and honey sweet.
Made a warm and cosy bed,
Where to lay her sleepy head;
Through that long, long winter?s day
Watched her as she sleeping lay.
Dearest Dear, refreshed, awoke,
And to Araminta spoke;
?Mortal, you were kind to me,
Well rewarded will you be.
?I will give a wish to you,
And I vow ?twill soon come true.?
Araminta thought awhile,
Then she wished that she could smile.
Araminta Stiff-as-Starch,
Born the thirty-first of March,
From that hour was ever gay,
Laughing, singing, all the day.


THE FAIRY?S CHOICE
There once was a dear little fairy,
The prettiest one you could see;
One day in the garden I met her,
And what do you think she told me?
She said that the fairies had sent her
To choose the best child she could find;
She asked me so sweetly to help her
To choose just the very best kind.
We saw dimpled babies in dreamland,
And good little boys with a book,
And dear little girls with their dollies,
Wherever we happen?d to look.
The poor little fairy was tired;
She paused by a blue-ribboned cot,
And said, ?Oh, I?m puzzled, I?m puzzled;
I think I must choose all the lot.?


GEORGINA
Georgina was a goldfish,
Very dignified and proud;
She hailed from bluest-blood fish
So of course she was allowed.
She never spoke to others
In the pool within the park,
But spent her time in tracing
Her relations, from the Ark.
Because your great forefathers
Were of blood so very blue,
That really shouldn?t stop you
From just saying, ?How-de-do??
The other fish grew angry
At her ways so stiff and cold;
They went and told the Bunyip,
Who is wise, and very old.
Georgina, she was swimming
With her old accustomed ease;
She heard the Bunyip roaring,
?All you fishes listen, please!


?The doctor has informed me
And he likes me more than most
I?ll end my days quite quickly
If I don?t have fish on toast.
?I?m asking all you fishes
To select one from your band
That won?t be missed or grieved for;
I am sure you understand.
?I?ll go and make the toast now
While you settle who?s to be
The dainty morsel chosen
To adorn the Bunyip?s tea.?
All eyes fell on Georgina;
Oh! all pale with grief grew she;
She thought it far from jolly
To be eaten at a tea.
She heard his footsteps sounding
Round the pool, as near as near;
She piped out ?Do not kill me,
Do not kill me, Bunyip dear!?
The Bunyip said, ?Georgina,
Will you mend your ways and be
A merry little fishling
Playing glad and happily??
?I will, O mighty Bunyip,
Be as good as you could wish;?
And since that day Georgina?s
Been an affable young fish.

MY GARDEN
If I looked and looked till I found a spade,
I?d dig and dig till I really made
The loveliest garden one could see.
One that would quite belong to ms.
There?d be roses red, there?d be roses white,
There?d be daisies that could say, ?Good night,?
And always in spring, for folks to see,
I?d have a golden wattle-tree.
There?d be poppies dancing in the breeze,
There?d be purple pansies sure to please.
But the sweetest thing of the lot would be
A lovely pussy willow-tree.
The dear little birds would sing all day,
And bring along their friends to play;
And if I asked the sun, I know
He?d shine right out and make it grow.


SLOW COACHES
Slow coach coaches
Are very, very slow,
I?ve been in one,
You see I ought to know.
Start past school time,
And always get home late;
Stop by roadsides,
And wait and wait and wait.
Slow coach coaches
Are sleepy as can be,
When it?s bed time
They are having tea.
When it?s up time,
They start to settle down;
Slow coach coaches
The laziest in town.


I?D LOVE A LITTLE SISTER
I?d love a little sister
With eyes so brown and sweet,
With hair so soft and curly,
And dimples in her feet.
I?d love a little sister
To live with me all day;
What fun we?d have together!
What games we?d find to play!
I?d let her nurse my dollies
And wheel them when we?re out;
I?d even lend her Teddy,
Without the smallest doubt.
I?d love a little sister.
When Santa Claus I see.
I?ll order one, for certain,
When next he visits me.


WHO HELPS MUMMIE THE BEST
?Who helps mummie the best?? said I
To Patsy and Jean and Joe;
?Who helps mummie the best? Oh dear,
I really should like to know.?
Patsy answered, ?I help a lot;
I mind the baby each day,
Tuck him up in his little cot,
When he is tired of his play.?
Jean, she said, ?Now listen to me;
I dry every dish and each spoon,
And set the table ready for tea,
When I?m home in the afternoon.?
And Joe, he spoke up last of all?
For it?s ladies first, you?ll agree?
?l bring mummie the morning wood;
She says she?d be lost without me.?
Then mummie came and sat near by
To take just a tiny rest;
She answered my question most readily,
?Why, all of you help me the best.?


A PUSSY-WILLOW PUSSY
I have asked a lot of people,
But they always answer me,
?You can never find a pussy
In a Pussy-Willow Tree.?
And it seems so strange and silly;
For wherever should they be?
It?s the proper place for pussies,
In a Pussy-Willow Tree.
I will always look up quickly.
Never think to pass one by,
?Cos I think they must be hiding.
For they may be rather shy.
If you ever, ever miss me,
I will tell you where I?ll be;
I?ll be looking for a pussy
In a Pussy-Willow Tree.


J
CORNERS
I love corners,
?Cos you never know
What you?ll see there,
When around you go.
I love corners,
Corners in the street;
There?s no knowing
What you?re going to meet.
Great big P?lecemen,
Boys who fly a kite,
Fat steam rollers?
?Course you might, you might.
I love corners,
?Cos you never know
What you?ll see there,
Till around you go.


THE PIXIE?S LOSS
A Pixie lost his right-foot shoe
And wondered what on earth to do:
The King, that day, had bade them all
Be present at the Pixies? Ball.
?Off comes my head, if I?m not there,?
The Pixie thought, in great despair:
In Pixie Land you could not see
A more despondent chap than he.
What can I do, what can I do,
To find another right-foot shoe?
What can I say, what can I say,
If from the ball I stay away?
This little Pixie fellow sad,
Thought over all the friends he had,
But out of all the short and tall
What weren?t too large would be too small.


iiliy
He hurried to the cobbler old;
His tale of woe was quickly told:
The cobbler shook his ancient head,
?It can?t be done,? was all he said.
The hours were speeding quickly by,
The Pixies? Ball was drawing nigh;
The Pixie fellow, white and sad,
Had cried away the tears he had.
A gracious Fairy, passing by,
Heard the poor little Pixie sigh:
She knelt beside him, wand in hand,
The sweetest Fairy in the land.
?What are your troubles, Pixie man?
I?m here to help you, if I can.?
Quick, quick he told her all he knew
About his missing right-foot shoe.
?Now shut your eyes and count to three;
Then stretch your right foot out to me,?
So softly said the Fairy maid;
The dazzled Pixie quick obeyed.
Oh, joy, the Fairy?s magic pow?r
Had found his shoe, at this last hour:
Then, full of glee, the Pixie small
Made haste to join the Pixie Ball.


-icon*
ONE, TWO, THREE
One to shut your peepers,
Two to keep them tight,
Three to wish for fairies
When the moon shines bright.
One to see a pixie,
Two to spy an elf,
Three to find a fairy
By your own small self.
One to see a mushroom,
Two for stooping down,
Three to find a fairy
With a silver crown.
One to see a moonbeam,
Two to coax it near;
Three to go a-riding
In the moonlight clear,
One to hear the
Two, they?ll dance and play.
Three they?ll make you welcome
In their own sweet


STORY-TIME
There?s dinner-time and playing-time,
There?s time to take a rest:
But out of all the times I know,
Why, story-time?s the best.
When Daddy sets me on his knee,
And takes a picture-book,
Then story-time has just begun,
And I just sit and look,
And listen, quiet as can be,
While Dad reads on and on,
Till eight o?clock, and then, alas!
The story-time is gone.
Some nights Dad reads of fairies small
In fairyland so far,
And how their wings are shining bright
And twinkle like a star.
And how they dance in magic rmg
Until the break of day:
The big sun rising in the east,
It beckons them away.
Sometimes he reads of little boys,
And girlies, sweet and good;
They never scream and cry like me;
I don?t suppose they could.
You must be very good and brave
To be inside a book,
And never get in tempers bad,
Nor give one angry look.


One tale my Daddy reads to me
About a red-haired boy,
Who has a monkey, all his own?
Now, that?s what I call joy!
They have such fun, you can?t believe
I think I?m with them, too,
And get excited as can be
At all they ever do.
It comes to bed-time very quick,
And as I get undressed,
I always, always think the same?
That story-time?s the best.
