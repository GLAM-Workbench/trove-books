PREFACE.
Australian rivers have their peculiarities, their phases oi beauty, even of grandeur. In this
work I have essayed to depict these characteristics, as observable on the river Murray, which
may be accepted, to a certain extent, as typical of Australian river scenery generally, since it is
common to three colonies, viz., Victoria, New South Wales, and South Australia (some of the
more northerly rivers are naturally more tropical in character). Captain Sturt discovered and followed
this river down. My friend and I went over the same water, after an interval of many years, but the
greater portion of its scenery remains unchanged (the population is so sparse); so in effect this illustrates
his exploration. I have confined myself almost entirely to the natural scenery. Time and increased
settlement will effect changes; timber which now luxuriates on its banks will gradually disappear. I trust
the following pages will not only prove of interest at the present time, since no series of views of this,
our greatest river, has ever previously been published, but will in the future, when those changes have
been effected, serve as a memento. I have quoted freely from ? Sturt?s Exploration,? incidentally from
the ?Australian Handbook,? and from a work entitled ?Victoria and its Metropolis?; and hereby
acknowledge my indebtedness.

TWELVE HUNDRED MILES ON THE RIVER MURRAY
Chapter I.
Surveyor-General of New South Wales, followed down the Castlereagh and Macquarie rivers
in an exceptionally wet season. He, in each case, reached marshes which appeared almost interminable,
and assumed that they were portions of a vast inland sea. This assumption not being deemed
satisfactory, Captain Sturt in 1828-9, it being a dry season , proved conclusively Oxley's error. No
inland sea existed; the two rivers were tributaries of a larger stream, which Sturt reached, and named the
Darling, after Lieutenant-Governor Darling (of N.S.W.). Many circumstances suggested the existence of an
inland sea. The coast-line as a rule appearing to be more elevated than the inland plains, the blacks described
a vast lake, which was probably Lake Alexandrina, near the mouth of the river Murray. Those surveying
the coast-line had not noticed the mouth of any considerable river, such as the Murray should have; but its
mouth is somewhat insignificant, and hidden to a great extent by a sand-bar. Many still believe in the inland-
sea hypothesis. The river Murrumbidgee flowed inland ; Sturt was again sent out to solve the problem as to
where it disembogued ?he was (as in the former case alluded to) successful, establishing the fact that it was a
tributary of a larger river, which he called the river Murray, after Sir G. Murray, of the Colonial Office at that
time. He and his party rowed to the mouth of this river; he was most favourably impressed with the fine reaches,
with the cliffs of fossiliferous limestone, of great extent and frequency, usually orange in colour. He gives a
graphic account of the threatened (almost actual) attack by a large number of blacks, who were thronged on a
sand-bank projecting far into the river (which was low at the time) ; their spears were poised. Sturt and his
men pointed their guns, in self-defence ; when suddenly a black ran down the bank, plunged into the river, which
he partly waded, partly swam ;in a few moments he pacified the hostile natives ?a wonderful instance of influence

or persuasive power developed to an abnormal extent. This occurred at the junction of the Darling and Murray.
On arrival at the mouth of the latter river, he found a large lake, and eventually a bar mouth unsuitable for navi-
gation. Rivers which have the best-defined mouths are usually of impetuous current, or contain such a body of
water as to bear down all opposition.
Most Australian rivers (after perhaps a short impetuous rush from their mountain sources) meander
sluggishly through depressed plains, and eventually reach the sea impotent to create a well-marked mouth.
A sand-bar is formed by tidal influence, and so the feeble efforts of the river are, to a great extent,
overcome. At Echuca (Plate L), 1,200 miles from the sea, the summer level of the river is about 265 feet above
sea-level; this gives an average fall per mile of a trifle over inches; but the lower portion averages far less
than this, the fall being greater inland than nearer the coast. The upper portion of the Murray is still
sometimes called the Hume, after the explorer who first crossed it, when en route from Sydney to the south
coast. This was prior to Sturt's exploration, but it was some time ere it was identified with the Murray.
After this expedition Sturt was for a time blind, owing to exposure to great heat and sun-glare, to
insufficient and unsuitable food. And yet he again, after some years of comparative rest, resolved to
penetrate to the centre of this vast continent or (more correctly speaking) island, his object being to prove
or disprove an idea which he considered worthy of being solved. This idea, he almost conceived it to be
an inspiration, was that Australia was originally composed of an archipelago of islands, and that the immense
plains, into which he, Oxley, Cunningham, and Mitchell (other well-known explorers), had pieviously descended
in proceeding towards the interior, had been originally sea-beds which separated these islands. This
exploration disproved his pet theory, all idea of an inland sea, past or present, was then abandoned. He
and his party underwent great privation, great suffering. Scurvy broke out, one died ; the heat was intense,
once reaching 132 degrees in the shade. For three months the mean temperature was as follows.

of wood) was drawn, handles fell from their instruments, their combs split up into fine laminae, the lead dropped
from their pencils. Evaporation was so great that it was almost impossible to paint or write. Their hair ceased
to grow. Their finger nails became as brittle as glass. Eventually, I understand, Sturt became totally blind ;
he was most intrepid, one of the bravest amidst the brave ranks of our explorers, Australia s greatest heroes, who
faced misery, hardship, famine, and death, in their efforts to benefit their fellow-men ; for, owing to their intrepidity
and their sufferings, an important result eventuated, viz., partial colonisation by the early pioneers, or squatteis,
who spread the first film of civilisation over a considerable portion of Australia, undergoing great hardships,
exposure, and danger; the natives being sufficiently powerful to greatly harass these isolated settlers, who rank
next in importance to the explorers in our Colonial history.
Chapter 11.
OUR TRIP
gpMBpgHE river Murray rises in the Australian Alps, and after a tortuous course of over 1,700 miles its
ill ill waters reach the sea, and it is estimated that, with its tributaries, it drains half the continent. The
SM tributaries are ?on the south side: the Lindsay, Loddon, Campaspe, Goulburn, Ovens, the Mitta
Mitta, and the Limestone. On the north : the Edwards, Murrumbidgee, Darling, and Rufus , the first-named
(the Edwards) cannot be considered a true river, being in effect a backwater, receiving and (after a course of at
least 250 miles) returning its borrowed volume of water to the parent stream. Denihqum is situated on this
backwater. This is a considerable Riverina township, celebrated for its sheep shows, being in the heart of a vast
pastoral district; it is also a sanatorium, its dry winter climate being most suitable for chest affections. The
melting snows in the Australian Alps, several of whose peaks attain an elevation of over 6,000 feet, feed the river
with its most certain supply.


Geology. ?The tertiary beds which form so large a portion of the continent are apparently divisible
into three regular horizons, of which the Murray basin forms one (this includes the Geelong and Hamilton
beds) ; these are miocene, and very rich in fossils, exceptionally well preserved. The pliocene beds are not so
well represented, being generally found as ferruginous outliers, with few fossils, and those not easily identified.
Professor Tait has made a special study of this subject.
A considerable time has elapsed since I first read Sturt?s exploration of this river. Its perusal interested
me greatly; so much so, that I resolved, should occasion offer, to row over the same water. It was necessary
to find a comrade in arms, and I was pleased when S intimated that he would join me; as I knew he, like
myself, was accustomed to rowing, to camp life, &c. We selected the winter as the most suitable time ; in
summer the stream is often low. the heat intense, the mosquitoes, ants, flies, &c., almost unendurable. Having
carefully selected a boat (in Melbourne), 16 feet in length, clinker built, nearly flat-bottomed, being thus
suitable for shoal-water, we were soon on our way to Echuca per train, and arrived in due course. We
had left an extremely cold district in Southern Victoria on the previous day ; here it seemed like summer, the
sun was so genial and warm, suggestive, indeed, of what the heat must be in summer. The town has a
population of over 4,000, is built on a neck of land, or peninsula, formed by the main river and its tributary,
the Campaspe; the streets are planted with trees; there are fine shops and hotels ; good gardens, water laid on;
but the wharf is the most important feature, the tonnage registered per annum being next to that of Mel-
bourne.
It is a busy scene in the wool season, when the Murray, Murrumbidgee, and Darling steamers arrive with
their heavily-laden barges; the latter portion of their journey, being against stream, taxes their full power.
The iron bridge over the river is one of the finest in Australia ; the railway crosses this en route for Deniliquin.
We had our boat lowered by one of the powerful hydraulic cranes, of which there are many, and were soon
*
in full progress, with a goodly store of provisions carefully stowed; for ours was to be a life in the open, a

camp life pure and simple. Everything was new to us ; we were as strangers in a strange land. The tringe
of well-foliaged gum-trees on either bank impressed us most favourably, for a time ; after a few days it was a
relief when a break occurred, proving that there was a world beyond. In this case it consisted of perfectly
level rolling plains with distant fringes of timber. ( Frontispiece .) The first station homestead of any impor-
tance was named Perricoota, a large brick mansion with very complete garden, &c. Beyond here we saw
goodly flocks of duck, teal, &c., and our Greener came into requisition. The first two shots fired on the
trip secured three black duck. This seemed as though the Fates intended to be propitious; and they were
so, as the sequel will show. We passed an important red gum saw mill, this timber being deemed most
valuable for a variety of purposes: wharf-decking, piles, street-paving blocks, fencing, &c. Shortly afterwards
a steamer hove in sight, towing a heavily-laden barge en route for Echuca. This upper portion of the river is
most tortuous, so much so that the steamers require careful handling to enable them (when towing a barge) to
negotiate the numerous sharp bends. The tow rope is attached to a stout pole amidships, swinging clear of
the deck houses. This enables them to take sharper curves than if the rope were attached to, or near, the stern;
a smaller segment of a circle is described by the barge. In due course we reached Koondrook, a typical
bush township, supported by neighbouring saw mills and farm produce, there being a considerable amount
of irrigation carried on in the vicinity. The supply is obtained from the Gunbower Creek, a small tributary of
the river. I had discovered by this time a very important fact, viz., that my friend S was a most expeit
cook, consequently the gun was frequently in requisition; black duck, wood duck, teal, widgeon, were constantly
our victims. We also set night lines for the Murray cod; and I may as well mention heie that, during the
whole trip, we provided ourselves thus with an ample supply of animal food, purchasing at the vaiious town-
ships groceries, vegetables, &c. We were able to secure good camps each night, and our tent was capable
of resisting any rain, but none fell. For the most part the nights were frosty, and a film of mist wreathed
the water in the early morning. To give, in the form of a diary, our entire row on this river would be


monotonous and necessitate tautology, for each succeeding day was to a certain extent a replica of that
preceding it. So I will in the first instance classify the different phases of scenery.

Heavy head winds prevailed. In these long reaches we experienced some very severe pulling day after
day. This wind used frequently to subside towards evening; the water soon calmed down. I preferred this
time and these effects for sketching, which will account for them representing (in some instances) placidity.
We occasionally met and interviewed men who were engaged killing rabbits. They did well, frequently
earning over �5, occasionally � B , per man weekly. They received id. per scalp and id. extra for the skin.
So we rowed on, wishing to complete our self-imposed task. This is a misnomer, for it was essentially a
pleasure trip, and we saw many things worth noting, the bird life in particular.
Chapter 111.
THE BIRD LIFE
|pp|HlS was certainly of the greatest interest. The numerous flights of white cockatoos, with their strident
CI T we saw three varieties?the sulphur-crested; the long-beaked, without any appreciable
crest; and the smaller type, the Leadbeater, or Major Mitchell, with a delicate pink shade on breast
and under wings, having a crest of red and orange) ; black-tailed parrakeets, their vivid green breasts
contrasting well with the sombre tail feathers; crimson-winged lorys, which flashed through the foliage

like meteors, with their bright crimson wing coverts, their green breasts and dark velvety backs; Pennant?s
parrakeets (often miscalled lorys), with rich crimson head and breast, and coerulean blue wing coverts; Rosehill
parrakeets, or rosellas grass parrakeets, &c. ?all these gave life and beauty to scenes which otherwise might have
proved uninteresting, for one tired of the endless gum forests, although fine, sometimes majestic in character.
Now an isolated bronze-wing pigeon rises with its loud peculiar beat of wing ; here again at intervals appear the
crested pigeon (in flocks), chaste in colour, elegant in form, one of the most beautiful of the family. On some
of the backwaters we noted the wattled plover, or peewit, the black-breasted ditto, and some dottrels, two varieties,
the one black-breasted, the other of a much paler tint. The graceful red-necked avocet, with its delicate upturned
beak, waded in the shallows. The large sandpiper (the Australian Tringa), and its smaller compatriot, both
elegant in flight, and extremely nimble of foot, skimmed above the mud-flats ; the painted snipe also, with its
beautiful plumage, ranging from grey to brown, with orange and black markings. It was not the true snipe (the
bird of passage) ; that delight of the skilled shot was probably revelling at this time of year (July) in the
morasses of China. The white crane, or egret, is one of my greatest favourites ; its plumage is of the purest
white and of the finest texture ; its ornamental back plume a mere suggestion of feather, a lace-like filament; it
wades in the shallows in quest of food, a somewhat solitary bird. The straw-necked or black-and-white ibis, a bird
of powerful flight, gregarious, is sometimes seen in hundreds ; in their progress through the air they assume the
form of an acute angle, and travel immense distances. Vast numbers of native companions, or giant cranes,
stride with aristocratic gait on the Riverina plains, and work destruction on the various crops. They have their
camping grounds, and in the evening-light hold their strange dance; now one, now two, now more, advance and
meet their vis-a-vis , then retreat, waltzing singly, their weight sustained almost entirely by their outstretched wings,
their feet trailing and occasionally touching, ever so lightly, mother earth. All are not dancing ; an orchestra is
reserved of one hundred or two hundred, the combined volume of whose powerful throat-notes is almost deafening.
Spoonbills, with peculiar yellow beak and legs, are wary birds, and are also gregarious. The nankeen crane or


heron is handsome, with his black head, nankeen breast, dark wings, and small white neck plume. At night we
occasionally heard the booming of the bittern in marsh-land near the river. Coots and water-rails were rare, but
not so the cormorants ; these enemies of all fish we saw in hundreds. The graceful form of the black swan scarce
needs describing, but they are worth studying; note them when they rise in flocks from some swamp, their white
pinions flashing. We saw fully four hundred pelicans rise from a backwater and whirl into space, ascending until
they, with their mighty spread of wings, grew small, and ultimately seemed to melt into the azure. The wild
turkey or bustard has (like the native companion) a lordly walk; he used to afford capital sport years ago, but is
now fully protected by the various Governments, as he renders valuable service in fighting the locust pest. Quail
are not so plentiful as formerly ; but crows (both black and white-eyed) are prevalent, and cruel in their habits, pluck-
ing the eyes from any weakly sheep, a perfect plague to the graziers, and in a minor degree to the horticulturist,
whose fruit they, in mere wantonness, nip off and cast to the ground. Let us, in preference, turn to our fliends
the magpie and the jackass with his rollicking bush laugh. Mountain duck, the handsomest of his genus, with
dark velvety head, white neck ring, chocolate breast, variegated back and wing plumage, were common amidst
the cliff portion of the river; they build their nests high up in the cliffs, and carry down their broods on their
backs or in their bills (when sufficiently grown to leave the nest). Black duck, teal, widgeon, and wood duck
were plentiful throughout (and afforded valuable additions to our commissariat department). The wood duck, 01
more correctly the maned goose, is noted for its elegant plumage : dark brown head, breast grey, with delicately-
marked tracery; wings variegated, white, green, merging into spotted grey back. I have used their feathers
for artificial flies ; they are quite as suitable as English grey mallard for evening moths, &c. The wedge-tailed
eagle, falcons, and kites are to be seen, especially in vicinities where rabbits were most plentiful. Emus
occasionally came to drink. These fine birds are becoming rare, having been hunted and shot down in
thousands. Swallows skimmed the water, their nests of mud depending from the cliff ledges. Occasionally
a honey-eater flitted from bush to bush. A robin, with his gorgeous breast, sat boldly watching us ; one variety

had not only the crimson breast, but a cap of the same dazzling colour. (I have in some cases adopted Gould's
nomenclature.)
This is a glance at the bird life on the Murray, of which there is a perfect wealth, especially when
the plains back from the river are devastated by the drought, the birds being then forced to visit the river
banks or starve.
Chapter IV.
OUR TRIP RENEWED.?THE ABORIGINES.
FTER the digression of the last chapter I will make further allusion to the river. Below Koondrook
(Plate II.) the breaks in the timber became more frequent, and some distance above Swan Plill there
'immm il wa s little to obscure our view of the plains, which rolled to the horizon, with distant timber belts
now and then observable. Here we saw a few kangaroo, which had come down to water. They were
very wary, and gave us no opportunity of shooting them. Soon we arrived at the point where the river
divides, forming Pental Island, which is 18 miles long, and is reserved as an agricultural college site. Many
swamps exist on these plains, above and below the town of Swan Hill (Plate HI.), and are resorted to by a great
variety of game and snakes. We have now passed Pental Island, the two channels have reunited, and
Swan Hill is before us, with its water tower, &c. It ranks next in importance to Echuca as a shipping port;
the streets are planted with pepper trees; there are good substantial buildings; population, about 300. Near
here is the Murray Downs station, with its well-known fruit garden, of course irrigated. We saw three
natives; they were not in their native dress (or undress), but were clad like white labourers. They
struck me as rather fine men. Lower down the river we saw others of this dying race; one particularly
stalwart, about six feet two inches in height, and very powerfully built. Buckley, the escaped convict,


who lived for thirty years with the aborigines, had great opportunities of studying their habits and customs,
but he appears to have been of obtuse intellect ?lived their life and made no attempt to elevate them. They
are usually gauged by their aptness for civilised life ; this is unfair, as their habits, traditions, necessities, do
not dispose them to accept the so-called blessings of civilisation. They were led to adopt the vices, not the
virtues. Their early contact with an inferior type of European degraded them mentally and physically.
According to Curr (a leading authority) they are of mixed negro origin, wandering hunters and fishers; never
sowing plants or tilling the soil. In build they are of easy, active carriage ;in temperament, light-hearted,
but suspicious and treacherous.
Native Customs . ?At eight years of age a boy leaves his father?s hut (or mia-mza :), and lives with the other
boys. Before he arrives at manhood he is only allowed certain food, the cartilage of his nose is pierced,
some of his teeth are knocked out, and he is subjected to lacerations so severe as often to prove fatal.
Infanticide is practised, and formerly cannibalism, especially by the northern tribes. They believe in sorcery,
and have a faint notion of a supreme power. They telegraph by means of smoke signals; a volume of smoke,
puffs of smoke, smoke from green or dry woods, all have their respective significations. Small-pox, pulmonary
?
complaints, and skin diseases were prevalent. They did not marry near relatives. They make capital nets,
are very expert in securing game, and dive into water holes and spear fish ; sometimes they sink themselves under
water, breathing through a reed, and wait for an unwary swan or duck to pass. Very skilled with their
spears, I have seen them knock over, at 60 yards, a shilling stuck in an upright cleft stick ; have also seen them
do splendid work with their nulla-nullas (or throwing sticks) amongst the brush kangaroo, and I can well imagine
a
what execution could be effected by a boomerang whirling amidst a flight of ducks. Considerably to the
north of the Murray there are long, narrow water-holes, frequented by duck, &c. The blacks note the exact
position of a flock, two of them steal beyond them; one swims across, taking one end of a net with him ; his
comrade retains the other end. They then secrete themselves, allowing the net to sink. Their friends

startle the ducks, which, as is their wont, fly straight along the water-hole. As they approach their hidden
enemies one of the blacks hurls into the air a piece of bark or stick. The birds, suspicious of hawks, swoop
downwards near the surface of the water; the net is now heaved up and tightened, and sometimes nearly the
whole flock is thus secured. They are lovers of sport, and have sporting songs, love songs, and incantations.
They are fond of their children when young. The women accept their hard lot (mere slavery) philosophically.
When dancing their corrobboree they become intensely excited; their bodies are streaked with white. They
stamp in unison, advance, retreat, every muscle quivering. It is a weird scene, lit up by many fires. Gordon
McCrae thus describes it:?
? Wild the device and strange the sign
That stand in many a snowy line,
From beaming face and heaving breast,
And limbs that seldom paused for rest.
Whilst all the rib-like lines laid on
Make each man seem a skeleton.' 1 ' 1
The results of the mission stations have not been considered altogether satisfactory; the number of
dialects necessitates instruction being given in English. When taken young they are frequently clever, quite
equal to the average European child; but the old Bedouin spirit assails them, and, perhaps, the older blacks
tempt them back to their natural wild existence. In their own state they exhibit wonderful acumen. For
instance, their marvellous tracking powers ?where no footstep or trace of one is observable by the ordinary
white man, a black tracker will be following rapidly the required trail, be it a lost child or a bushranger.
Their bush lore and knowledge would enable them to live well where you or I would starve. A dying race ,
capable of a very considerable mental advancement, if they appreciated the necessity. The above describes
the Australian black generally; not the Murray river tribes in particular, but certain customs that pervade
the whole race.


We are now proceeding from Swan Hill to Euston, the next township of any importance. As a rule
we had most comfortable camps. The most unpleasant one was a few miles below Swan Hill, on a mere
ridge, the river on one side, a swamp on the other; and a gale of wind so strong that we dared not hoist the
dry tent to its full extent, but pitched it low, securing it with every spare piece of rope we possessed, the
oars, &c. In addition to this we had to make a breakwind for the fire with our (tent) fly, the only fuel being
dry thistles. But we had some cold duck in the larder, a boiling of potatoes and tea, and then we crawled into
our tent, now only four feet high. Next day we were pleased to reach the timber fringe once more. The
rabbits on the banks seemed to get thicker and thicker as we progressed, ruining the country. On poor country,
where the carrying capacity is small, the rabbits will never be exterminated unless some epidemic sets in (or is
introduced), the return from this class of land would not warrant the expenditure. Add to this the terrible
droughts which periodically prevail, and the graziers? lot cannot be a very prosperous one (with exceptions, of
course). The average rainfall on these inland plains is a trifle over six inches per annum. During the last
twelve months (an exceptionally dry and disastrous time), lam informed, only two inches have fallen. We pass
Toolibuc, a place of little importance. The width of the river has now increased considerably, and also the
length of the reaches. The wind still blows half a gale; we have rowed against it for many days, and would
like a respite ;it subsides sometimes towards evening, but rises again during the night. Occasional red banks
and bluffs now appear among the red gums; these are not sufficiently high to be designated cliffs, but they
are suggestive of possible cliffs further down, being a proof that the banks are gradually rising. The stream
is still tortuous in places. We always (at least, one of us), if we hear the throb of a steamer at night, get
up and fend off the boat, lest the wash might damage her. Judging from the noise the steamer is close,
you can see the lights through the trees; then they disappear, the sound gradually subsides, and she is evidently
travelling for the time being away from you, rounding some bend. We have often been detained thus for over
half an hour in very light apparel. The following will exemplify the river?s winding character (in parts). We held






a yP'A" \Jf .syfMi&t v* *atiL )K J�&. .jaL^il
A FLOODED TRACK, NEAR RIVER




some conversation with a man who was mending a fence near his abode. We rowed for four hours and
a-half, and saw, apparently, another workman on the bank. It was the same individual, still patching his fence.
He recalled our previous meeting, and by standing up in the boat we saw his cottage about 200 yards distant.
We had rowed 20 miles. He had in the same time renovated his 200 yards of fence. The peninsula
was his holding.
At length we reached Euston, a comparatively small place, a crossing for stock with the usual requisite,
a punt. Here we saw the first large passenger steamboat. Some of them are most commodious and have
electric lights throughout; very large ones forward, which enable them to travel by night. They appear
somewhat top-heavy, having two-storied deck-houses, and draw very little water. We might have travelled in
one of these, but the objects of the trip would have been defeated had we done so. We both wished for a
good outing, with a modicum of sport, and plenty of exercise, and I intended sketching ?so it was necessary
to be in a position to stop when any interesting scene appeared. Hawking steamers also ply, and carry
large and valuable supplies of things needful, and luxuries. I once travelled from Morgan to the lake on
one named the Queen . She was kept in as good order as a man-of-war. The captain (and owner) was most kind
and attentive; the table excellent. We pulled up at every camp, station, or town. They had for sale rifles,
breech-loading guns, dress materials, different brands of tobacco (this was important) ; in fact, a sufficient variety
of goods to stock a considerable shop; valued at over �2,000, renewed at intervals. It is a strange sight, when
camping on a dark night, to see one of the larger boats with the blazing lanterns forward, and a retinue of
smaller lights aft (those appertaining to the saloon and cabins), ploughing through the water, casting a lurid
light on the surrounding foliage. They consume a vast amount of wood, and have regular wood piles at
certain spots, supplied by wood cutters at a fixed rate per ton measurement. We had been successful in
capturing cod, but at this point on the river caught our champion fish, 55 pounds in weight; they have
occasionally been taken over 100 pounds. But the small ones are preferable. We here ran out of tobacco, and


did not expect to reach any town for over two days. However, luckily, we had retained a considerable portion
of this large fish. Half a mile below our camp we found some rabbiters camped, who were working 100
traps, and making about �6 each per week. They had not tasted fish for some time. We made them a
peace offering of 20 pounds weight. It seemed natural that the tobacco question should be discussed after
this friendly introduction. They presented us with nearly a pound of strong black fig, and we smoked more
than ever. These rabbiters told us it was rather hard work attending to so many traps, especially as they
had to visit them frequently; otherwise the hawks seized the rabbits when trapped. All sorts and conditions
of men appeared to follow this paying business. One young fellow had been overworked in a city office,
became weak and prostrate. He had been rabbiting for eight months, had quite recovered his health, gained
16 pounds in weight, and had earned more than he did formerly in the office in a year. Some, on the
other hand, were roughdooking fellows, and gave surly replies if interrogated. People at the different towns
were interested in our trip, but gave us most misleading information as to distances, &c. At this point of
the river (not far above Mildura, 500 miles from our starting-point) there are some exceptionally fine red gums.
I measured one 44 feet in girth 5 feet from the ground. This stood back about 200 yards from the river
bank, a gnarled forest king. The flood waters undermine the large trees near the water?s edge. Snagging
steamers cruise about, notice any that are likely to fall into the stream and impede the channel, fell them,
taking care that they fall away from the river. A considerable sum is spent annually in this manner on
the Murray, Darling, and Murrumbidgee. The rabbits still romp on the banks, and assist in devastating
the country, notwithstanding the rabbiters. It is like trying to beat back an ever-advancing tide.
There are two phases of the scenery which I have not yet alluded to, viz., the Murray pine ridges
which at intervals appear near the river. These trees are quite as picturesque as the Pmus msigms, and
infinitely more valuable, being suitable for building purposes and fencing; and, being white-ant-proof, are
esteemed highly in the locality. They have a knotty grain, which looks ornamental for inside lining, especially

when varnished. They grow in such even lines that it is difficult to believe at first they have not been
planted. The box-tree flats. ?This tree is a stunted eucalyptus or gum, and is peculiar to flats which are
periodically flooded. A very hard, good burning wood, but not so serviceable as the pine, not being ant-
proof?a great desideratum where these pests are prevalent. These ants perforate and destroy woodwork to
an alarming extent, therefore any ant-resisting material is highly appreciated.
Besides the rabbiters, there are men who make a good living by trapping and netting cockatoos,
parrots, parrakeets, including the beautiful budgeree-gar (native name). These men know the feeding grounds
of the different birds, their migrations, &c. They are very successful in the vicinity of the water holes or
tanks (in the Riverina), and use very large nets. Thousands are thus caught and sent to the Australian cities
and shipped to England. Many of those captured are old birds, and cannot be taught to speak like
nestlings.

some respects this is the most interesting place on the river, especially to anyone who has watched
the development of (comparatively speaking) waste lands into a series of gardens. The land, in its
I BbslS original unimproved state, grew mallee, blue bush, and Murray pine, was subject to drought,
and a perfect rabbit warren. A friend and myself resided there soon after the Chaffeys had received the
Government concession, so we saw it ab initio. When I say resided, I mean we camped in a small tent
on the adjacent river-flat, and had several neighbours, viz., the leading surveyor (who was mapping out the
settlement) with his assistants, a retired naval officer, a skilled musician, a bricklayer, &c., &c., and we were a
happy family. We basked in the sun on that river-flat. The thermometer reached up to 120 in the shade; 112


and ns were common readings for a time, but intervals of cooler weather ensued, being the result of thunder-
storms. We became impressed with the enterprise, its probable successful issue in the future, and invested in
land. Of course some time would naturally elapse before the channels could be formed, &c., so m the meantime
we remained in our camp. An enterprising store-keeper had already started business within a quarter of a mile of
us (his was the only house near); we were thus able to obtain all necessaries, even luxuries. Fish could be caught
readily, and we had a pleasant time, notwithstanding the legion of flies by day, and the myriads of mosquitoes at
night; but we (wisely) had our tent protected with mosquito netting. Occasionally the Messrs. Chaffey drove
USO ut to view the promised land. They resided in the old station homestead, for Mildura was for many years a
sheep run, devastated ultimately by droughts and rabbits. After a time I revisited the settlement. Great progress
had been made ; many settlers had arrived ; channels were being constructed, land cleared and graded. We
were now camped on our land, nearly two miles from the stream. We, and all our neighbours, were cutting down
the blue bush and mallee. The former was stacked in heaps and burnt. It was a strange, somewhat weird scene,
on a calm frosty night to see these numerous fires, as though an immense army were camped on the plains. The
mallee was cut, the huge bulbous-shaped roots, drawn out by the traction engines, being piled up and burnt. These
powerful engines had also cleared the town site and the avenues; then, working night and day, by their aid the land
was scarified. Channels were formed, pumping plant erected, then planting and house erection, timber being sup-
plied by the local saw mill, principally Murray pine. Many, however, especially young bachelors, lived in tents. A
busy scene this; but all were buoyed with hope. The Californian fruit-growers had succeeded well, why not those
at Mildura ? For some time everything prospered ; a considerable town arose in the erstwhile wilderness , throngs
of visitors arrived weekly; many remained, having purchased land, which gradually rose in price; town allotments
which cost �2O went up to �350 ; this was too good to last, it was a boom on a small scale. Complications arose,
returns did not accrue as quickly as some anticipated, expenses were heavy (price of land, development, water
rates), and the very existence or demise of Mildura was discussed. Government are now assisting, and will

probably do so to a larger extent in the future. A railway would enable them to send fresh fruit to Melbourne
and enhance the value of Mildura property; would also (en route) open up more mallee land for settlement, for
wheat-growing; and would secure a portion of the Darling River trade. Up to the present Mildura must have
been a valuable addition to Victoria financially; over a million has been expended, the greater portion by English
settlers (introduced capital); the freight and passenger receipts must have been considerable; the Customs?
returns merge into large figures. New steamers were built and a direct impetus was given to the Murray river
traffic generally, and a very large amount was spent in labour. Add to this the fact that the products have been
an unqualified success, the dried fruits especially so. Let us hope that fortune may smile in the future on the
settlement, that assistance may be granted sufficient to tide over the present difficulty. It exemplifies the policy
of the Victorian Government in a most accentuated form, viz., an aggregation of small holdings. The ordinary
selector with his two hundred, or three hundred, or more acres, is individually a large landowner compared to the
average Mildura settler. In the future, when our population has increased tenfold, when the Murray waters
are conserved by a series of locks, affording practically an unlimited supply, irrigation will be carried on to a
very large extent. The volume of water was gauged some years ago, the mean flow per twenty-four hours being:?
in April over 590,000,000 gallons ; in September, when the melting snow was contributing, 7,250,000,000
gallons, i.e. billions.
What has been done up to the present at Mildura and Renmark, is a mere suggestion of what may
be, will be, effected in the future when a large population, with commensurate markets, shall warrant it.
Fruit-growing is not the only industry; lucerne, with irrigation, in this climate luxuriates. A man with a
small holding (rabbit-proof netted) of three hundred or four hundred acres thus improved, could carry (and
fatten) eight sheep to the acre ; his comparatively small holding would be more valuable than 10,000 acres

un-irrigated, rabbit-infested, and subject to repeated droughts.

BELOW MILDURA
have now left Mildura?s orange bluff, with intervening box-tree flat and scattered red gums, and
reach Wentworth after a row of about 34 miles, the reaches being occasionally 2 and 3 miles long
lillm (it was one of our heaviest days ?this distance, against hall a gale of wind, being no joke). We
met and interviewed a man who was travelling alone in a somewhat cumbrous boat, which he worked with
hand paddles. Until this opportune meeting we considered we had made good progress, having averaged
28 miles per day; he assured us he frequently averaged 60 or 70 miles, that he had shot twenty-three ducks
in one shot; the hauls of fish he had made were simply prodigious; in fact, he was a magnificent liar
{splendide mendax). We watched him start once more in his lumbering boat, certainly at not more than the
rate of 2 miles per hour (and he was evidently doing his utmost for our edification) ; at this estimate 60 miles
would require thirty hours, not a bad day's work; he evidently did not belong to the eight hours per day party.
The Murray and Darling (Plate V.) run almost parallel for some distance, so that in coming down the
former river, one can see part of the town of Wentworth across the narrow peninsula some time ere the actual
junction is reached. We now see the exact spot where Sturt had such a narrow escape from the blacks,
although the projecting sand-bank is only partly uncovered, the river being higher than when he made his
celebrated journey. Wentworth is a well laid-out town, situated on a plain. There are fine shops or stores,
hotels, and private residences, with good gardens, irrigated and productive ol splendid fruit. It had privately
been proved what could be effected by irrigation at the different stations and towns, long before the IVtessrs.
Chaffeys Irrigation Colonies were thought of. With water, everything is possible in this climate, in the way
of fruit culture or agriculture. Without this everything* is doubtful, except in occasional seasons when the

rainfall is, compaiativ ely speaking, excessive for this and inland territory. The town is supported by the
neighbouring pastorahsts (population nearly 1,000), The Darling is slightly discoloured, and for a time
sullies the waters of the main river. It is a fine tributary, and drains an immense area, including portions
of Queensland; when in flood it is, in parts, 30 miles wide; steamers occasionally miss the true channel,
and travel o\er the flooded country until difficulties arise. One captain told me that, in this manner, he
tia\ elled 8 miles from his true course, and had great difficulty in rectifying his mistake. Inversely , in times
of drought, the river is, in places, a mere string of disconnected water holes, salt almost as brine ?this is
caused by brackish springs; it was once closed for three seasons in succession ; steamers were detained for
two and a-half years at Bourke, and other towns. Wool could not be sent away and caused a great
temporary loss to the graziers. Now there is a railway from Bourke to Sydney, which obviates a recurrence of
this; that is, so far as the upper river is concerned. In good seasons this river is navigable for over 1,500 miles.
And now we must resume our journey against that deadly wind. Looking up stream, the peninsula
which separates the two rivers appears to be an island. There is nothing special in the scenery; the only
thing worthy of comment being the increased width and volume of the river; the slight discolouration effected
by the Darling water soon disappears. Rabbits still foregather on the banks, ducks rise in hundreds, the
culinary skill of my friend is frequently utilised. We catch cod almost nightly on our hand line; the last
one captured weighed only nine pounds, the smallest we had caught, and the best, studied from an edible
point of view. We passed Morna station, a beautifully situated place on the N.S.W. side, the house and
garden nestling amidst most luxuriantly foliaged timber. Renmark scarce needs description, as it is a counter-
part of Mildura, in many respects. The town site is not so commanding as that of the former place, and is
suggestive of occasional flooding (in parts), being comparatively low; it is situated on a noble sweep of river.
The Messrs. Chaffeys courteously drove me round and about the settlement, and the land seemed, back from
the river, quite equal to that at Mildura, so far as I was capable of judging. We are now in South Australia,


having passed the much-disputed boundary, which, owing to faulty instruments, was fixed about 2* miles
too far west. South Australia claims this strip, but. with federation imminent, these disputes seem trivial, an
we cannot be absolutely certain that, even now, this 141 st meridian oi longitude is located with absolute accuracy.
No one in England can imagine what a frightful pest rabbits are. With a thick population, they are easi y
kept in check. With a large range of sparsely populated territory, they are apparently quite masters of the
situation. On one station, considerably to the north of the Murray, in a few years they killed 2,700,000
(two million seven hundred thousand), expending vast sums in rabbit-proof netting and m this destruction;
they had long drives made of this wire netting (temporary erections) gradually narrowing; gangs of men
acted as beaters; 15,000 were killed on one occasion. 8.000 and 9,000 frequently: but the most effectual
plan, in the back paddocks, away from the river (the Murrumbidgee), was poisoned water m troughs, the
tanks being fenced off temporarily, and all stock removed; so each paddock was worked. After this wholesale
slaughter, with each paddock securely netted, the owners considered they had checked them for all time, became
careless, and disinclined to expend any more capital in this manner; now the rabbits are nearly as plentiful and
as destructive as formerly, and I am afraid will result in the ruin of many more pastoralists, who already m
parts have relinquished their stations, owing to their depredations, and under these conditions, who would be
bold enough to occupy these deserted areas, even if offered as a gift? An effectual remedy has been
suggested: inoculate them with some deadly disease, which would spread rapidly and destroy them. But
there is no proof that stock would not also be affected, were this carried into effect.

Chapter VII.
THE CLIFF SCENERY.
of the cliff scenery is in the South Australian portion of the river. They never occur on both
iliiiliil Sl des simultaneously; the opposite bank is usually low, with scattered timber of considerable size.
It appears as though the river in its course reached this rock formation and attempted to cut a
passage through, was repulsed, and forced to deviate on to the plain country, meeting again with the
same obstruction at intervals, the same deviation being necessary; in effect, this is a continuous belt of
fossiliferous limestone ol great extent. The first cliff we saw was striking in appearance, but not so lofty as
those seen subsequently. 1 hey are all yellow or orange in colour, somewhat glaring (almost aggressive),
are frequently 200 feet high, and extend in unbroken line for a mile or more, massive and bold in
character, full of cracks and crannies and overhanging ledges, rich in fossils, frequented by mountain duck,
cockatoos, and swallows; bare, having no belt of shrubs or foliage at their base, and seldom on their summits.
After a time we became tired of them, a species of cliff-nausea attacked us, they were so frequent, so similar, so
glaring in tint, we preferred the intervening timbered reaches, with the everlasting rabbits and an occasional
emu or kangaroo. One cliff we estimated at 250 feet in height, and two miles in length?a large steamer
skirted its base, and appeared a mere toy.
Some of these intervening reaches were of great extent, three and four miles in length, and over 200
yards wide. What would we have given, in the old rowing days at Cambridge, to have had such stretches
of water, instead of the narrow, shallow Cam ?
Before I proceed further, I must refer to the backwaters, as they are a feature of the river. They are
in great numbers (and extent), and for sport are better than the actual stream. We have rowed for miles on


many of them, and on more than one occasion have had difficulty in finding our proper point of exit. They
are bewildering, having many channels, separated by mud banks, often covered with lignum bushes, obstructed
by trees, both standing and fallen. A stranger following down (on foot), the banks of the river, might come
to the narrow connecting channel ; instead of wading or jumping this he decides to travel round what
appears a small swamp or bilabong; it perhaps means ten, fifteen, or twenty miles ere he again reaches the
river bank, wet to his middle, for he has been obliged to wade numerous channels. A man visited us who
had travelled in a black?s canoe, which he had purchased for five shillings. He had journeyed for a week thus
without tent or blankets, a river Bedouin, living a life as rough as that of the blacks. He is typical of a class who
live thus on these rivers; begging food at houses, &c. In character similar to the well-known Sundowner, who
toils not, neither doth he spin, but loafs round from station to station receiving rations and house accommodation.
At nearly all large stations they have a special travellers? hut. Some years since I was on a visit at one of
these stations, each night some arrived; during my stay of two months the smallest number was eight, the largest
twenty-six; they all received rations (gratis), and retired to their allotted quarters. They are beggars, as much
so as their confreres in the cities; they live in this manner from one year?s end to the other, and are a con-
siderable tax on the graziers. Their entertainment has become quite a sine qua non , an institution, and dates
back (as customary) many years. My own impression is that this originated as follows :
In the early days of settlement convicts were assigned to some outlying squatter; it was a recognised
thing that people en route should accommodate and assist them on their journey; and rightly so, for they were
really going to obtain work, different from the wandering class above referred to. Some years since the
shearers? strike caused great trouble: these unionists formed camps and prevented free labourers from under-
taking work which they themselves had previously refused to do; they went to great extremes (vi et armis ), and
matters culminated when they burnt a steamer on the river Darling for having dared to carry free labourers.
This strike spread throughout the various Colonies ; in the more settled districts, where police could readily

be concentrated, they did not attempt these extreme measures. It was difficult to arrive at the true cause :
people said it was owing to some of the squatters charging too much for the meat supply, and yet this scarcely
seemed to me a satisfactory explanation, for they struck also on stations where they were found in rations.
On many stations they are paid a larger price per hundred (for shearing) and provide for themselves. Com-
petent judges asserted that they were, and are, better paid than any men in the world for similar work. They
should be well paid, for it is no child?s play, especially in those almost tropical inland districts. After the
above digression, I will resume my narration of episodes which occurred en route. We had retired early ;
at about 12 p.m. a powerful steam-whistle aroused us, and we were somewhat surprised when a large steamer
ran into the bank close to our tent. In a moment a plank was run out, and we were invited on board; she
was a hawking steamer. We bought a few things, tobacco, &c., and were struck with the well-fitted store;
but they could not supply us with No. 12 cartridges. No. 16 they had in thousands, this gauge being used
for rabbits. So, down timbered reaches and past mighty walls of cliff we proceed, and reach Morgan, an
important town, since it is connected by rail with Adelaide. This has ruined the lower river steamer trade, most
making Morgan their terminus; this would not be the case if there were an open mouth to the river suitable for
navigation. The town is situated on a high yellow bluff or cliff, has good hotels, stores, &c. A good deal of
fishing is done in the vicinity, Murray cod commanding a good price in the Adelaide market. We saw several
fishing camps; very rough and primitive they were. A fisherman will have a number of lines, perhaps twenty
or thirty set; he has in connection with each a springy switch (or stick) about four feet high, with a bell
attached to the top ; the line is half hitched round this, and the fish sounds his own knell; we adopted this
plan successfully throughout the trip. We saw three emus near a cliff, but on the whole they were scarce;
they have been too much hunted and shot, as previously stated. Now, however, an effort is being made to
prevent them becoming extinct; they are protected throughout the year. The weather was becoming warmer,
ants were troublesome at our camps, and a few flies worried us, but were not in myriads as in summer time.


We saw two snakes apparently in deadly combat, and settled the dispute with our Greener, a splendid weapon,
long in range, and a hard hitter. We shot a mountain duck at ninety yards (measured); it was literally a
pot shot (we wanted that bird for culinary purposes); one shot had penetrated the eye. Cliffs! cliffs! more
pronounced in colour, more aggressive, so on to Blanchtown, an unimportant place in point of size, contrasting
most unfavourably with the next township, Mannum (Plate XIL), one of the prettiest and busiest places on the
lower river. A considerable amount of agriculture is carried on in the district; we are gradually appioachmg
the coast, and the rainfall is more reliable and greater than inland ; there are good hotels, stores, flour-mill,
substantial stone buildings, and a large punt for crossing stock. The river here is very wide, fully 250 yards,
and the stretches of water are striking, three and four miles in length ; the country is much more open, and
we have parted with the cliffs, at least we hope so.
The surroundings are more interesting. Farms appear at intervals beyond the scattered timber fringes.
The country is undulating, hill and valley clad with verdure, refreshing to the eye, after our experiences amidst
arid plains and rugged cliffs; for although it was winter time, we have had only four showeis dunng the last
six weeks, and loss of stock was considerable on the outlying stations. More cultivation, more giassland, and
we reach Murray Bridge (distance by rail 423 miles from Melbourne, and 6 from Adelaide), a fine structure with
iron piers and superstructure ; it is (including the approach over swampy ground) 700 yards in length the
true river channel is not more than 200 yards. The overland line connecting Melbourne and Adelaide
crosses here. We reached Wellington, a small town half buried in sand, a crossing place for stock. We
were under police surveillance here, without at the time being aware of it; and rowed about i| miles below the
township, the low banks planted with willows, and camped near a ruin formerly a shooting box used by
the Governors of South Australia, About midnight (cold and moonlight) two men arrived in a boat, ana
kept watch till morning; explaining that they were members of the police force. They submitted us
(separately) to a cross-examination; we were evidently suspected of being run-away villains horn N.S.W.,

our garb was not very aristocratic, and perhaps they were to be excused for entertaining these suspicions ;
they eventually departed apparently only half satisfied. We now reach Lake Alexandrina (Plate XIV.), and
are surprised at its extent; and we rowed 38 miles on its waters, being thankful that it was calm. Point
McLeay is duly reached, named after McLeay who accompanied Sturt. Prior to this, we had passed the
comparatively narrow channel which connects Lake Albert with this lake, and had noticed a very fine homestead
on the shore. This was the residence of a grazier who possessed a valuable property, and who, although
situated near the coast, with a fair annual rainfall, had improved his estate by a complete system of
irrigation
The Mission Station at Point McLeay has done good work ; the aborigines, under a firm but kindly
rule, have become peaceable and well-conducted ! when first under control, they were essentially fighting men.
Some of the men, in the busy season, leave the mission and work as shearers, &c., subsequently returning
to their harbour of refuge. The children are bright and intelligent, and make rapid strides in their school
work. We still have some distance to travel, and proceed across a large expanse of lake, then through
Hindmarsh Passage, past Hindmarsh Island to Goolwa, our terminus. Thus ended our interesting trip of
over 1,200 miles on a fine river. The hard exercise day after day had conduced to health of body; the new
experiences, the sketching, the study of bird life, &c., had pleasantly occupied the mind. Now a sad
parting, a long farewell, took place between craft and crew. She was a capital boat?built by Edwards, of
Melbourne ?so we had no difficulty in effecting a sale, and, after a time, the buyer wrote saying she had won
three races in the local regatta. Goolwa is situated on a rise, and has good hotels, shops, produce-stores,
&c., but its glory has, to a certain extent, departed, owing to the railway from Adelaide to Morgan, which
has ruined the trade on the lower river.
The jetty is 700 feet in length, and here we saw several steamers laid up, useless. We were informed
that the lake was sometimes so rough, steamers dared not face the nasty choppy sea, so we were fortunate


in having almost a dead calm until we reached Hindmarsh Passage, when we shipped water freely. The
population of this town, Goolwa, is about 700; 75 miles per rail over the hills to Adelaide, reminding one
somewhat of the ranges traversed by the train to Toowoomba, Queensland ?the same engineering diffi-
culties, the occasional distant peeps of scenery, but these are more English in their character. Small
villages are clustered in the intervening valleys; English fruits, such as raspberries, strawberries, &c? luxuriate.
Many of the leading residents of Adelaide have fine mansions on these hills,* used as retreats in summer
from the great heat on the plains below. A few days in Adelaide, with its fine streets, buildings, gardens,
&c., and we depart per ?City of Adelaide? (a most comfortable boat) for Melbourne.

CONCLUSION
7p||||| HAVE, elsewhere in this work, referred fully to the bird life, and have casually mentioned sport; I
mm now particularise. There is splendid duck shooting, especially on the backwaters generally,
lllilli and in the marshes contiguous to the lower river. The Earl of Kintore (formerly Governor of
South Australia) and party bagged (in a few days) over 1,400, the greater portion of which they forwarded
to the various Adelaide Charitable Institutions; from 900 to 1,100 have been similarly shot by other
sportsmen. My friend and myself never entered a backwater without securing some. They are at times so
plentiful, that steamers are obliged to suspend nets in front of the forward lights as a protection; even then

they will in their bewilderment frequently dash into the deck houses and immolate themselves. Fair quail
shooting is to be had, snipe in their season, native companions, ibis, bustards (or turkeys), water rails (these
are scarce), kangaroo, and rabbits galore, &c.
Angling. ?The Murray cod is almost invariably caught on stout hand-lines, but can be taken more scienti-
fically with rod and comparatively fine tackle. Their mere weight requires patience on the part of the angler.
They are sluggish, with no suggestion of those wild, vigorous runs which the true sportsman delights in. Perch
and fresh-water bream (the latter quite distinct from his namesake who inhabits the coastal rivers) both give
capital sport, and run up to five pounds. The cat fish, a peculiarly flabby creation, with pendant fleshy
feelers, is also frequently caught. Also a kind of trout, nearly all scales and bones, in appearance somewhat
like a sea mullet; and large Murray lobsters, with a most formidable array of spikes, a small fresh-water
cray fish, and turtles.
Locusts. ?These pay periodical visits, in countless myriads, appearing like a driving snow-storm, carry-
ing devastation before them. Their dead bodies, heaped up on the railway lines, have frequently stopped
trains. When they are crushed the rails are rendered so slippery that the wheels cannot grip. So they pro-
gress (dying in vast numbers en route), depositing their eggs in the ground, to be hatched by the summer sun.
A Darling Shower. ?Few people know what this is. No rain falls. A shower without rain seems
anomalous. In the heat of summer you notice a black cloud in the north or north-west, suggestive of
thunder. There will be no thunder, no grateful moisture will be shed on the arid plains. A former
unpleasant experience may have taught you what this cloud really is; if so, you will run for shelter.
It is a vast accumulation of dust, whirled into the air, and forced onward by a gale of wind. This
dust permeates everything, even your nostrils and bronchial tubes. These so-called showers are dreaded,
being not only unpleasant but unhealthy. Anyone exposed in the open is rendered almost helpless,
being bewildered and blinded by this dust ?by a murkiness, a darkness more pronounced than that


caused by a London fog. In mentioning the towns, I may have failed to convey the fact that they are
situated at very long intervals, and the riverside residences are only occasional. Even when travelling in a
steamer there is a feeling of isolation, the population being so sparse; when rowing, this feeling becomes
accentuated. This river may be seen under various climatic conditions : under a blazing summer sun; in the
frosts of winter; m flood time, when the low-lying lands are submerged for miles.
In time of drought, when all steamer traffic on the upper river ceases, to be renewed when the melting
snows on the Australian Alps or inland rains shall have replenished the stream ?when flock after flock of
waterfowl darken its surface, driven from the interior, where all the moisture has been (temporarily) evaporated
by a pitiless sun ?see how the land birds congregate en , in the forest belt near by, till the slender
summit branches quiver beneath their superimposed weight. Note how, after a time, they depart, flight upon
flight, as they came; for they know that rain has fallen on the far-distant northern plains. By what, by whom,
has this revelation been made ? by reason, by instinct, or by The Deity ?
