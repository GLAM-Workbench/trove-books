PREFACE.
r- PHE article on Sydney Views, herein
reprinted, was first published in the
February (1890) number of The American
Philatelist . It has since been submitted to
several of my friends for suggestions and cor-
rection, and they have very kindly complied
with my request.
In some respects the article has been ma-
terially changed. At the suggestion of Major
E. B. Evans, R. A., important additions have
been made.
Indeed, I may say that to him the reader is
indebted for what value this monograph may
contain, while he is in no respect responsible
for its arrangement.

INTRODUCTION.
THE research of Messrs. Philbrick and
Tapling, and the criticism and supple-
mental papers in the Philatelic Record
by Major Evans and Dr. Houison, have laid
open the whole history of the “ Sydney
View” stamps, to all who will take the
trouble to read up the subject; but as the
desired information is so widely scattered, -it
seems to me that a compilation of all the
facts that have been brought out would be
very desirable, especially as so few collectors
have the time or the disposition to read all
the literature that must be perused before a
clear understanding of these most interesting
stamps is arrived at.
One can truthfully say that very little was
known of these stamps until the publication
of that most valuable work, “ The Postage
Stamps, Envelopes and Postal Cards of
Australia and the British Colonies of
Oceania,” under the auspices of the Lon-
don Philatelic Society in 1887. To the
authors of this work is due, directly or in-
directly, the credit of all that has since been
learned, as without their patient labor, the
collectors of Australia, and even of Europe,
would never have given the time and thought
to the subject that it has since received.




In this paper no new facts will be brought
forth ; I simply hope to materially increase
the general store of knowledge by reiterating
what has been written, and by giving, in a
convenient form, a summary of the good
works that others have done. At all events,
all that is valuable in what follows, is de-
rived from the above-named four gentlemen,
while what is not will probably prove to be
my own.
I will not give my authority for each state-
ment made, but refer all, who may be dis-
posed to criticise, to the Philatelic Record
and to “ Oceania.”




Sydney Views.
IN considering this issue historically, there
are a few facts which it may be well to
place together, for the sake of convenience,
and in order to avoid the necessity for fre-
quent repetition.
The three values were issued simultan-
eously on January i, 1850, and notwith-
standing the length of issue and variety of
types and values used at the same time, the
whole series, according to Mr, Philbrick, can
be made up on but one kind of paper—that
first used, the soft yellowish paper.
Fortunately we have some official matter,
which is of such importance that it should
be given in extenso.
“By Section 10 of an Act of Counsel
13 Viet., No. 38, passed 12th of October,
1849, postage stamps were directed to be pre-
pared and issued for the colony and to be
sold to the public. The period when this
was to come into effect was the Ist of Janu-
ary, 1850.”
Also,
“ Notification that at first stamps will only
be issued for the subjoined values one
penny, twopence and threepence.”




For letters not exceeding weight one-half ounce:
Within the limits of the town of Sydney., id.
Inland (within the colony) 2d.
Ship letters 3d.
The following rates of postage were fixed :
(In addition to any inland postage.)
All newspapers id.
But most important of all is this letter
“ The Postmaster-General, to the Hon-
orable the Colonial Secretary, sub-
mitting Accounts of Engravings of
Postage Stamps.
“ General Post-Office, Sydney,
“No. 49-112. 21st December, 1849.
“ Sir :—I do myself the honor to submit
the undermentioned accounts for copper-
plate engravings of postage stamps, and
request you will obtain authority for my in-
cluding them in abstract.
“ 2. The amount can be paid out of the
sum voted for this department for the cur-
rent year, a balance of remaining
unexpended; but in explanation of the dif-
ference in price, I beg to state that I was
obliged to employ separate engravers, the
plates being urgently required, and that I
made the best arrangements I could, under
the circumstances. ,
“ Robert Clayton, for furnishing a copper
plate containing 25 engravings of the penny
postage stamp, ten pounds (^10).
“ John Carmichael, for furnishing a cop-
per plate containing 24 engravings of the
two penny postage stamp, twelve pounds
twelve shillings (£l2 12 o).
“ H. C. Jarvis, for furnishing a copper
plate containing 25 engravings of the three
penny postage stamp, seven pounds (^7).




“ Charles Kay, for providing articles re-
quired in printing postage stamps, five
pounds eleven shillings and nine pence
(;£5 11 9)*
“ Amounting in all to thirty-five pounds
three shillings and ninepence.
“ I have, etc.,
“ (Signed), Jas. Raymond.
“ The Honorable the Colonial Secre-
tary, etc., etc., etc.”
This series of stamps is composed of three
values, id., 2d. and 3d. As to the first and
third of these, there is very little discussion
as to plate, date of issue or paper; while as
to the second (the 2d.), an enormous amount
has been written, and I fear that most of it
must be put aside as valueless.
In the consideration of each value the
following points will be considered in the
order in which I will give them:
I. The date of issue.
11. The engravers and engraving of the
plates.
111. The design, and
IV. The various papers used.
As it has been lately shown that there was
but one plate of each value, I think there is
no longer any chance of misleading any one
by the use of the word “ Plate ” instead ot
the phrase “ state of plate.” I shall there-
fore designate these, the original and the
retouched plates, as Plates I, 11, etc., for
the sake of having a uniform classifica-
tion for these varieties throughout this
issue.




ONE PENNY.
The color used for printing the one-penny
stamp was prepared as follows : Scarlet lake,
four parts; Chinese vermilion, two parts;
flake white, one part.
I. Date of Issue.
We know from the above that this value
was issued on January i, 1850.
11. The Engraving and Engravers of the
Plates.
All authorities agree that there was but
one plate for this value engraved, to-wit:
that engraved by Robert Clayton, which we
know from the existence of an entire sheet
contained twenty-five stamps, arranged in
five rows of five stamps each.
It is also a fact, which cannot be disputed,
that after a short service this plate became
so worn that it became necessary to retouch
111. The Design.
In the left background is a view ot
the town of Sydney on a hill, which slopes
down to the sea-coast or harbor. On the
hill-side are two trees. Below the hill, on
what looks like a level plain, is the figure of
a man and an animal, apparently engaged in
plowing or some other agricultural pursuit.
On the sea, in the distance, there is a brig
at anchor, heading to the right. In the
left foreground there is a female figure
seated on a bale, and apparently holding
a whip over her shoulder. She is very im-
prudently leaning upon what seems to be a
bee-hive placed upon the bale. The bale is




divided into four compartments by double
lines, the left lower compartment containing
the numerals 17, and the right 88 (1788
being the date of the foundation of the col-
ony). The left hand of the figure is out-
stretched. In the right foreground is a
group of three other figures, two males and a
female; the figure on the right is kneeling,
probably in supplication, but possibly offer-
ing some gift which does not appear in the
design. On the ground, between the three
figures on the right and the single one on
the left, lie a pickaxe and a spade, to which
the seated figure is apparently pointing. At
the feet of the three figures there is a chain,
of six or seven links. Below the figures, and
divided from them by a line of color, is the
legend, “Sic Fortis Etruria Crevit,”
in two lines on a white ground, and printed
in small block capitals. The quotation is
taken from Virgil (“Georgic II,” Verse 533),
and the translation is, “ Thus grew mighty
Etruria.” The sky is unclouded. The
whole of this portion of the design is en-
closed by a white single-lined circular band,
containing the words, “Sigillum Nov.
Game. Aust.,” in solid block capitals, and
meaning, “ Seal of New South Wales.” In
the upper portion of the band, between the
words “Aust.” and “ Sigillum,” is a small
eight-point star-shaped ornament. The
spandrels are filled in with dots on a white
ground. At the top and bottom of the
stamp are two straight labels, with ground
of horizontal and vertical lines crossed,

upon which are the words, (top) “ Postage,”
(bottom) “One penny,” in white Roman
capitals. The corners consist of white
square blocks, containing Maltese crossed
ornaments. On each side, and bounded
top and bottom, by the corner blocks, there
are two vertically lined bands, divided from
each other by a white line. The inner two,
which are infringed by the circular band,
contain a kind of trellis of white lines, and
the outer ones are similarly ornamented
with white spirals. The whole stamp is en-
closed by a single-line rectangular frame.
(The design in the centre of the stamp is
a copy of the old Great Seal of the Colony.
The three figures on the right are immigrants
landing at Sydney, received by industry,
who —surrounded by her attributes, a bale
of merchandise, a bee-hive, a pickaxe and
a shovel—is pointing to ox and plow, and a
town rising on the summit of a hill, with
(what was intended for) a fort for its pro-
tection ; the masts of a ship are seen in
the bay.— Houison.')
PLATE I.
This has always been des-
ignated as the “finely en-
graved ’ ’ stamp. The illus-
tration enables one to see
at a glance the prominent
feature of this stamp. There
are “ no clouds,” the hill is
not shaded, and all the dark portions of the
lettered labels and the bands at the sides
are formed of a close shading of fine lines.

We next come to the earliest date we can
fix by the actual letters franked by the stamps.
A pair of the finely engraved stamps has been
seen on a letter dated January 14, 1850
(within two weeks from the date fixed for the
issue of the stamps).
The plate began to show wear after a few
months, as is shown by a dated specimen,
and finally it became necessary to retouch it
(Mr. Tapling thinks in July, 1850), as is
shown by impressions from the retouched
plate (or from Plate II) on a letter dated
August 21, 1850.
PLATE 11.
‘‘Coarsely engraved ”
stamps. The hill is now
shaded; there are clouds in
the sky. The top and bottom
labels are apparently of
solid color (though this is
possibly due merely to a
greater amount of ink being used in print-
ing), and the lines generally of the stamps
are coarser and thicker. With these ex-
ceptions there is no part of the foregoing
description that will not apply equally to
the coarse as to the fine stamp.
In connection with the coarsely engraved
stamps, Mr. Philbrick suggests that the en-
graving was done by one Mason, but Dr.
Houison can find no mention of any such
person in the official records.
On the retouched plate the engraver
neglected to insert the lines for the clouds




in the fifteenth stamp; in the eighth stamp
the hill is left unshaded ; in the seventh
stamp, though the hill is shaded, the trees
are omitted.
IV. The Various Papers Used.
The finely engraved one penny (together
with the earliest specimens of the two and
threepence) are found upon a soft, yellowish
paper, somewhat spongy in texture. The
papers used for these stamps are :
i. The soft, yellowish paper.
Harder paper, white or slightly blue.
3. White paper, but finely ribbed, pro-
ducing the appearance of closely laid lines.
The finely engraved one penny on true
laid paper is not known ; on finely ribbed
paper it is exceedingly rare.
The coarsely engraved one penny is found
upon:
1. Medium paper, blue or slightly blue.
2. Hard paper, thick, white, or slightly
yellowish, varying in substance.
3. Stout paper, white or slightly yellowish,
deeply ribbed, and presenting the appear-
ance of broad laid lines.
4. Same as last, but slightly blue.
Note. —The ribbed paper used for the
finely engraved one penny, is much finer
(that is, the ribs in the paper are much
closer), than that employed for the retouched
one penny.
These stamps are found showing parts of
the word “ Britannia” as a watermark, and
in other parts of the paper the manufacturer’s
name. These watermarks, of course, have
no significance.




TWO PENCE.
The official formula for the color of this
value, is as follows :
Ultramarine, nine parts; Chinese blue,
one part; and flake white, two parts.
It is about this value that there has always
been the greatest uncertainty and the great-
est difference of opinion. Dr. Houison, who
seems to have examined the subject very
thoroughly, in the light of official records,
has compelled us to agree with him that all
that has previously been written, as to the
number of plates used, is entirely obsolete
and useless. It will, perhaps, be better to
treat this value as I have the one penny,'
leaving these debatable questions to the in-
dividual researches of my readers.
I. The Date of Issue.
This value (with the three pence) was
issued at the same time with the one penny,
to wit : January i, 1850. About this
there is no difference of opinion, so far as I
know.
11. The Engravers and Engraving of the
Plate.
The letter of James Raymond, dated
December 21, 1849, which I have given
above in full, informs us that the plate
was furnished by John Carmichael and that
it contained twenty-four engravings, which
we now know were in two rows of twelve
each.
Dr. Houison has shown us that, besides
the frequent “ sharpenings,” this plate
was four times “ repaired.” We have then




five distinct states of the plate after repairs
had been made, but no new plate. These
correspond to Plates i, 2 and 3 and the re-
touched plates, the existence of which has
heretofore been undisputed.
Since therefore we have so many “re-
touches,” I think it best to designate impres-
sions from each of these “States of the Plate
as simply “Plate I,” etc., as the case may
be, both for the sake of uniformity and
clearness.
I distinctly repeat that by the word
a plate ” I mean “ State of Plate,” and do
not wish to convey that there was more than
one copper plate engraved for this value.
111. The Design.
The central portion bears the same de-
vice as on the one penny, but smaller, not
touching the lettered labels at top and bot-
tom. The inscription on the circular band
is divided above by a small ornament re-
sembling a letter “ W,” with shading at
each side of it, between aust. and sigillum ;
and below, by a device like a fan (usually
with seven points), between nov. and game.
In each corner of the stamp is a white block,
square or nearly so, connected together at
the top by a label inscribed postage on a
solid ground of color, at the bottom by a
similar label inscribed two pence, and at
the sides by vertical labels filled in with
interlaced wavy lines, in imitation of en-
gine-turning, forming a series of ovals ; the
spandrels between the circular device and
the labels at top, bottom and sides are filled
with straight and wavy lines.




Plate I.
A. The lines in the span-
drels run vertically; the cor-
ner blocks each contain a
roughly formed Maltese
cross, with a kind of aste-
risk (*) in the centre;
there are lines of shading
along the circular band on each side of the
fan, and the lines dividing the latter run to
the points of it. The inscription on the
circular band is in small Roman capitals;
the Bale on which Industry is seated is
divided, by single lines, into four compart-
ments, the two upper of which contain “No
0,” and the two lower “ 17-88.” One
variety on the sheet contains two series of
vertical wavy lines in the spandrels, instead
of one set of straight and one of wavy.
This is the design as originally engraved,
the following varieties are due to reengrav-
ing of the plate as it wore out.
Plate 11.
A, recut. The first plate
of the twopence wore away
rapidly, and in February,
1850, a repair or retouch
was found necessary. The
first dated specimen known
is postmarked February 24,
1850, that is to say, within two months after
it first came into use. This first repair seems
to have been confined for the most part to
deepening some of the original lines of the


,1 3T4Ul'i
■
■»1 ifl ■ //} «jd3i -f ,-<( ' ■ ' »


engraving, especially the outlines of the
labels, and, in some of the types, those
of the circular band, which are made
very conspicuous; on certain types also a
second line is noticeable above the lower
label. The central device is very indistinct
on most of the impressions from the plate
in this stage, the date, etc., on the bale had
quite disappeared, and, in many instances,
the shading outside the fan also. The lines
in the spandrels, however, are always visible
to a greater or less extent.
These two first states of the plate are most
easily distinguished from those that follow
by the vertical lines in the spandrels.
B. The plate having become still further
worn, a more thorough reengraving took
place. The lines in the spandrels are re-
placed by similar ones running horizontally;
in each corner block is cut a very rough and
irregular eight-pointed star, with a hollow
centre ] the inscription on the circular band
is in small block capitals. The other char-
acteristics were varied by further recutting,
from time to time, as described below; but
there is one prominent variety which runs
through the whole series, No. 20 on the
sheet having a fan with six points only, in-
stead of seven.




Plate 111.
81.B 1 . The most important
distinctions are in the span-
drels, which are filled in
with straight and wavy hori-
zontal lines crossed. The
abbreviated words in the
circular band are printed
in small block capitals,
The fan, except in two types, is divided
as before, and it is shaded inside with
short lines in addition to the dividng lines;
on the other hand, there is no shading out-
side the fan, along the circular band, except
in one type on the sheet. The bale is usually,
divided by double lines; it bears the date,
etc., as before, and there is a dot in the
centre of each of the corner stars. No. i
on the sheet shows the fan shaded outside,
as in A, but the dividing lines run to the
reentering angles, instead of to the points;
No. 2 is divided in the same way, but with-
out the shading outside.
The earliest known date attached to a
specimen of this stage is April 20, 1850.
Plate. IV.
82,B 2 , The fan is divided by
lines running to the reenter-
ing angles, as in the varieties
of 81,B 1 , but there is no shad-
ing, either inside or outside ;
the bale bears no date or
inscription, and is divided
by single lines; there are no dots in the




corner stars, the rays of which are somewhat
thinner, and present the appearance of being
more separated from each other. There are
trivial differences of the spandrels and reticu-
lations, and a few other unimportant modifi-
cations. The earliest known dated specimen
is October 23, 1850.
Plate V.
B s . There is only a slight
amount of recutting to dis-
tinguish this from the last
stage. The principal points
being that the bale is divided
by double lines, and that a
small circle is drawn round
the hollow in the centre of each corner star,
thus connecting the eight dashes of which it
is formed. Other slight alterations were made
in the reticulations, and here and there the
lettering appears to have been touched up.
As a rule, these stamps are printed in rather a
fuller shade of blue than the others. One
variety (No. 10) has a double-lined bale, but
has no circle in the corner stars. The earliest
dated specimen is January 20, 1851.
Plate VI,
84.B 4 . The salient difference,
which at once distinguishes
this from all the foregoing,
is, that in the centre of the
fan, in place of the small
trefoil found in all the other
stages, is a small circle or
pearl, causing this to be known as the “ Fan
3 ith Pearl * ’ type.




The fan is divided as in Plate IV and
Plate V, but in most (if not all) of the types
on the sheet, there is, in addition, a verti-
cal line drawn to the central point of the
fan. The style is clean, the lines clear and
distinct, and the whole effect light. On
this plate is found the variety “ fan with six
segments ” (No. 20) ; and that with the
laborer’s pick and shovel wanting (No. 17) ;
those catalogued with “ hill and ground
unshaded,” with “ hill only unshaded, and
with no clouds,” do not exist. The earliest
dated specimen is May 10, 1851.
IV. The Various Papers Used.
To a great extent the papers used for this
value are the same as those employed for
the one penny, and seem to have come into
use about the same time. All the earliest
specimens of the first, second and third
states of the plate, were printed upon the
soft, yellowish paper ; in fact, the first is
found upon no other, though this paper oc-
casionally absorbed a little ink in the im-
pression, which gave it a slightly bluish
appearance. It can easily be distinguished,
however, from the hard, bluish paper which
succeeded it, and which must have been used
after the third state came into existence,
as comparatively early copies from this state
are printed upon it. The earliest specimen
seen by Mr. Tapling of the twopence, on
bluish paper, is dated June 3, 1850.
A third kind of paper seems peculiar to
the fourth and sixth states, and to a few
specimens of the third. It is hard, of me-




dium thickness, and in color gray, or dirty
white. It is distinct from the hard bluish
paper, though it is possible that this paper,
originally white, has become tinged in some
cases with the color of the impression. Pos-
sibly the drum may have had something to
do in changing the color of the paper. Spe-
cimens of the fifth and sixth states are found
upon ribbed or laid paper, identical with
that used for the one penny. Mr. Tapling
thinks that it was used intermittently, pend-
ing a supply of the ordinary paper. The
earliest specimen known to him is dated
February 27, 1851.
The four kinds of paper used were a»
follows:
1. Soft, yellowish paper, occasionally
tinged with blue.
2. Hard, bluish paper, varying in sub
stance.
3. Hard gray or dirty white paper.
4. Ribbed or laid paper, white or slightly
bluish. The laid lines are always vertical.




THREE PENCE.
The color used for this value was made as
follows: Mineral green, six parts ; crystal
green, two parts; flake white, one part. The
official designation of the color of the
stamps was mineral green and emerald green.
I. Date of Issue,
This value, together with
the one-penny and two-
pence, was issued on the ist
of January, 1850, and con-
tinued in use until Decem-
ber, 1852.
11. The Engraver and Engraving of the
Plates.
The letter of Mr. James Raymond, given
on pages 6 and 7, informs us that H. C.
Jervis furnished the copper plate containing
twenty-five stamps, which we know were in
five rows of five stamps each.
111. The Design.
As far as the centre portion is concerned,
it is practically the same as that of the one
penny and twopence, with double line and
dated bale, the only difference being that
the legend “ sic fortis,” etc., is printed in
three lines instead of two. There are two
white perpendicular bands at the sides (im-
pinged upon by the centre white circular
band), filled in with horizontal, colored ovals,
which sometimes touch and sometimes in-
terlace each other. The spandrels are com-
posed of straight and wavy horizontal lines
crossed, and the corner of the white, square




blocks, containing Maltese crosses, with four-
point star centre. Straight linear labels,
above and below, containing the words,
“ postage ” and “ threepence ” in colored
block capitals. The design is completed by
a single rectangular, colored line, and, as in
the one-penny value, there was no divisional
or compartment line to the plate.
IV. The Various Paper Used.
This value is found upon four different
kinds of paper like the other values.
i. Soft, yellowish paper.
2. Hard, bluish paper.
3. White laid or ribbed paper.
4. Bluish laid or ribbed paper.
These varieties of paper were probably
used contemporaneously with the same in
the other values.
