Remarks on a New Victorian Haloragis, and on the
occurrence of the Genus Fluchea within the Victorian
Territory.
By Baron Ferdinand von Mueller. K.C.M.G.,
M.D., PhD., F.R.S., &u.
Haloragis Baeuerlenii.
Very tall, glabrous; leaves comparatively large, all opposite
and of equal form, somewhat decurrent into the short stalk,
lanceolar, crenate-serrulated, faintly veined, the apex of
the serratures deciduous, leaving a callous base, the upper
leaves not much smaller, and never alternate; flowers, at
least in part, axillary and solitary ; two of the calyx-lobes
deltoid, the two others dilated, or truncate-rhomboid; tube of
the calyx, when fruit-bearing, expanded into four broadish,
conspicuously-veined membranes, of these, on each side
of the somewhat compressed tube two approximated ; styles
four, very short; stigmas beardless; fruit rather large,
four-celled, pendant from a stalklet of half or nearly its
length ; pericarp spongy ; seeds irregularly developed.
Between rocks in ravines on and near the summit of
Mount Tingiringi, at an elevation of about 5000 feet;
W. Baeuerlen. This remarkable and seemingly quite local
plant attains a height of five feet, the stem finally gaining
an inch in thickness. Branches spreading ; branchlets
opposite, quadrangular, as well as the young shoots often
of a reddish tinge. Leaves mostly from one to two inches
long and from one-third to half inch broad, fiat, gradually
narrowed into the acute apex, dark-green above, somewhat
lighter colored beneath ; the leaves of young shoots pinnati-
lobed in their lower portion. Pedicles, so far as seen,
solitary in the axils, but perhaps also sometimes racemosely
arranged, as would appear from remnants of flowering
summits of branchlets. Stamens as yet unknown, only


fruit-bearing having been obtained. Fruit
roundish-ovate in outline, from hardly one-quarter to fully
one-third inch long, the four surrounding membranes two
and two confluent with the broadest lobes of the calyx, and
decurrent much beyond the fruit-cells, the latter small in
proportion to the pericarp. Matured seeds not available
yet.
This species shows most affinity to H. racemosa, from the
mild coast-region and low hills of South-western Australia,
the only other congener (unless H. alata and H. monosperma),
which attains to great height; but the leaves are generally
shorter, their denticles rather curved inward than spreading
and soon getting blunt; the floral leaves often at least do
not become much diminished in size; the fruit is pro-
portionately broader, its longtitudinal membranes are more
expanded and not almost equally distant, while its endocarp
is harder. Whether the petals are gradually much acuminated
and generally longer than the stamens, as those of H. race-
mosa, remains yet to be ascertained. The last-mentioned
species should also be placed into the section of oppositi
florae. Mr. W. Webb found it on Mount Lindsay (Mrs.
M'Hard) near the Blackwood River. In various respects
our new sub-alpine plant is allied also to H, scordioides,
H. alata and H. Gossei. Now an apt opportunity is afforded
to point out, that the genuine H. alata from New Zealand
and the Chatham Islands cannot be regarded as absolutely
identical with the East Australian plant, admitted under
that name into the Flora Australiensis, in as much as the
small blunt and often downward-bent appendages at the
angles of the fruit in the legitimate species do not occur in
any of the Australian specimens seen by the writer of these
remarks; besides, the leaves of our plant are longer and
narrower, also more decurrent into the stalk, while the floral
leaves are more reduced to bracts; indeed the Australian
plant verges closely to H. serra, but has four styles, as also
a four-celled and four-seeded fruit; either as a variety or
as a distinct specific form it might be distinguished under
the name exalata.
H. cordigera has been traced to the Serpentine River
(F. v. M.) ; the fruit is shorter than the calyx-lobes, and not
rarely bearing hairlets.
H. scoparia bears a fruit roundish-ovate, compressed,
beyond the base upwards slightly quadrangular, much
longer than the calyx-lobes, two-celled and two-seeded.


H. hexandra was seen by the writer of these lines near
King George?s Sound and the Shannon; the leaves, when
fresh, are carnulent.
H. odontocarpa extends to the Gascoyne River (Forrest),
to Youldeh and Ondabinna (Tietkens), to the Elizabeth
River (Giles), to the Lachlan River (Tucker).
H. serra ranges to the Clarence River (Beckler), Hunter
River (Miss H. Carter).
H. excdata was obtained at Mount Dromedary (Reeder),
on the Burnett River (Hely) ; the leaves are paler beneath ;
the stigmas are not conspicuously bearded.
H. rotundifolia varies in height from one-half to four
feet; it is perennial, like nearly all its congeners ; we know
this plant now from Karri-Dale (Walcott), the Shannon, the
Collie, the Preston, and the Serpentine Rivers (F. v. M.)
The leaves are sometimes not at all larger than those of
H. micrantha, to which species this plant bears some
resemblance in the capillary branchlets of the panicle and in
the minute fruits.
H. scordioides has an irregularly wrinkled, truncate-
globular, somewhat quadrangular fruit, not much longer
than the calyx-lobes.
H. micrantha has been sent from Walcha by Mr. Crawford.
H. depressa occurs on Mount Field, at elevations from
3 to 4000 feet, also on Mount Kosciusko (F. v. M.)
H. teucrioides has been found in New England (C. Stuart),
in Yorke?s Peninsula (Tietkins), near Streaky Bay and
Fowler?s Bay (Mrs. Richards), in Kangaroo Island (Prof. Tate).
H. tetragyna reaches the Tweed (Hickey), the Dawson
River (O?Shanesy), and the Darling Downs (Law).
H. leptotheca is contained in our collections now, also from
King?s Sound (Hugham), Yeldham Creek (Armit), Trinity
Bay (Fitzalan). H. acanthocarpa, to which Bentham joins
H. leptotheca, seems rather to constitute a form of H.
tetragyna,to which latter would, early in the century, be much
more readily accessible to Brogniart than the intra-tropical
H. leptotheca.
H. elata extends to the Castlereagh River (Woods), Mac-
quarie River (Betche), Darling River (Burkitt), Lachlan
River (Tucker), Gawler Range (Ryan), Condamine River
(Hartmann), Bogan (Morton), Dawson River (O?Shanesy).
Contrary to what the specific name would imply, this plant
seldom attains a height of two feet; some of the leaves
assume occasionally quite a lanceolar form.


H. rudis is often erect, but seems never a tall species; the
branchlets are remarkably robust; the leaves have a particu-
larly thick pale margin.
H. nodulosa was gathered by the writer at the Greenough
and Irwin Rivers; eastward, it extends to Israelite Bay
(Miss Brooke), and Esperance Bay (Dempster).
H. paniculata occurs on the Collier, Preston, and
Blackwood Rivers (F. v. M.)
Haloragis pycnostachya.
Erect, rather dwarf; beset with spreading soft hairlets,
leaves firm from lanceolar to rhomboid-ovate, flat, serrulated,
almost sessile, the lower opposite, the upper scattered; flowers
in dense terminal spikes ; bracts ovate-lanceolar, foliaceous,
about as long as the flowers or somewhat longer; flowers
singly sessile in each axil; calyx-lobes four, almost deltoid,
much shorter than the four outside short hairy petals;
stamens eight; stigmas conspicuously bearded ; fruit small,
subtle-downy, somewhat quadrangular, rough from two
transverse rows of minute tubercles, above the upper row
contracted and streaked, usually one-celled and one-seeded.
Near Israelite Bay (Miss Brooke). Differs from H. conferti-
folia in the longer and less dense vestiture, in much larger
and less crowded stem-leaves, in broader and shorter calyx-
lobes, in more noduligerous and upwards more conspicuously
contracted fruits, the latter reminding of those of H. nodulosa.
H. heterophylla must include also H. ceratophylla, accord-
ing to the respective drawings by De Caisne, and by Bauer;
it belongs more particularly to the coast-regions, while
H. aspera pertains chiefly to the inland country, and thus
not occurs in Tasmania. Further, the H. pinnatifida (A. Gr,
non J. H.) seems a state of H. heterophylla ; Endlicher
derived his plant from Shoal water Bay; his description
accords fully with the earlier one given by Brogniart, except
the remark on the supposed unisexuality of individual
plants, pronounced evidently from imperfect material. Our
collections show this species to inhabit the following
localities beyond those already recorded; Gordon River
(Miss Oakden), Mount Lofty (Tepper), Barossa Range
(Dr. Behr), Wannon River (Sullivan), Emu and Gres wick
Creek (Rev. W. Whan), Loddon, You Yangs, Snowy, and
Hume Rivers (F. v. M), Genoa (Baeuerlen), Paramatta


(W oolls), Moon a (Crawford), Hunter River (Miss H. Carter),
Clarence River (Redder), Richmond River (Miss Edwards),
New England (Stuart), Armidale (Parrot), Tweed (E. Hickey),
Brisbane River (Leichhardt), Comet River (O?Shanesy),
Georgina River and Gainsford (Bowman), Warrego and
Maranoa (Barton), Burdekin River (F. v. M.), Mount
Surprise (Armit). The flowers are sometimes fascicled,
and occasionally supported by long floral leaves. Forms
with particularly long and narrow leaf-lobes, seemingly
also belonging to this species, bear much resemblance to
Meionectes. At the whole it is less robust than the
following:?
H. aspera was originally in 1836 collected by Sir Thomas
Mitchell on the Murrumbidgee ; it has a wide range, thus
is known from the Upper Darling River (Wuerfel), Warrego
(Mrs. Cotter), Barcoo (Schneider), Charlotte Waters (C.
Giles), James and Finke Rivers (Kempe), Evelyn Creek
(A. King), Mount Everard (E. Giles), Musgrave Ranges
(Forrest), Eucla (Carey). Any endeavour to separate H.
glauca specifically from H. aspera, would prove futile ; for
unison the latter name is preferable. Under the name
sclopetifera a plant is separable from H. aspera, either as a
variety or perhaps as a distinct species, on account of its
verrucular calyx, which when fruit-bearing, is copiously
beset at the summit with narrow dilated and often simply
or doubly-hooked excrescences, its leaves are from linear-
lanceolar to broad-linear; it is known only from Norman
River and Spear Creek (Th. Gulliver), and from Aramac
Creek (Dr. Poulton).
H. acutangula extends to Point Sinclair ; its leaves are
rather flat and often somewhat denticulated.
H. salsoloides has staminate and pistillate flowers on
distinct plants, as first observed by Messrs. Haviland and
Deane, who found this rare species at Double Bay, consociated
with Casuarina nana ; it is often only half-a-foot high, even
when fruiting, and then somewhat reminds of Tillaea recurva.
Specimens from any mountain region never came under the
writer?s notice.
H. Gossei was found near the Finke River (Rev. H.
Kempe), at Glaring (Young), at Alice Springs (Ch. Giles), in
the glen of Palms (E. Giles), on the Mulligan River (Cornish),
Field River (Winnecke), Nickol, Cane and Ashburton Rivers
(Forrest), Exmouth Gulf (Carey) ; occasionally the fruits are
tetramerous.


H. trigonocarpa was obtained at the Gascoyne River by
the Hon. John Forrest, and a variety with linear leaves at
Lake Austin by Mr. H, S. King.
H. digyna is now known also from Israelite Bay (Miss
Brooke), Eucla (Oliver), and Lake Bonney (F. v. M.); its
calyx-lobes occur sometimes of deltoid form, and they
number not rarely like the petals styles and fruit-cells
three or four; but, though the fruit may be quadrangular,
it is only one or two-seeded. From H. digyna cannot be
held apart as a species H. mucronata. Sometimes the fruit
produces callous extrusions, thus far reminding of the inner
sepals of Rumex ; the margins of the petals turns sometimes
bluish.
H. pityoides occurs on the Arrowsmith River (F. v. M.) ;
it is Drummond?s plant 706 ; the calyx-lobes are almost
deltoid, the fruit is sometimes densely beset with hairlets.
H. pusilla is closely allied to the foregoing.
H. monosperma forms somewhat leafy spikes to the
length of three inches; according to specimens sent by
Mr. G. Macï¿½ae; the petals are almost white, gradually
pointed, not prominently keeled, and fully to one-quarter
inch long ; thus, as far as blooming is concerned, it proves
the most conspicuous among its many congeners, so far
approaching the Loudonias, to which it bears similarity
also in tall growth, while it verges to the Serpiculas in
carpologic characteristics; but the fruit of a few other species
may ripen also only one seed, notably those of H. tetragyna
in India, as pointed out by Mr. C. B. Clarke in Sir Joseph
Hooper?s Flora of British India, 11., 431, and as noted
already by C. Koenig.
H. trifida will likely prove a Myriophyllum, while the
H. cyathiflora, to judge from Fenzl?s descriptive notes, may
possibly be a gyrostemonous plant.
In concluding these short references to Australian Halor-
agese, it might yet be observed that the genus Meionectes
can no longer be maintained, after what we more recently
have learned of the numerical inconstancy of the floral
divisions in several species of Haloragis. Indeed, Meionectes
became impaired in its generic position, already by the
discovery of a dimerous species as well of Loudoma as of
Myriophyllum, and Bentham also noticed before that his
Haloragis tennifolia was closely connected with Meinoctes
Brownii. In that plant being placed under Haloragis now,
the generic name serves aptly for specific signification.


Pluchea conocephala.
Euryhia conocephala, F. v. M. in the Transactions of the
Victorian Institute, 1., 36.
Dwarf-shrubby, much branched ; leaves small, obovate or
spatular-cuneate, flat, entire, as well as the branchlets grey
velvet-downy ; flower-heads sessile, singly terminating
branchlets imperfectly dioecious; involucre at first almost
hemiellipsoid-cylindrical, at last obverse conical; involucral
bracts in several rows, rounded-blunt, near the upper end
somewhat velvet-downy and fringy-ciliate, the outer bracts
abbreviated, the lowest verging to an oval form, the inner
bracts gradually elongated, narrowly elliptical-cuneate, and
finally beyond the middle recurved; receptacle minute ;
flowers few within each involucre and extending considerably
beyond it; corolla of the perfect staminate flowers slightly
dilated above the middle, those of the most developed
pistillate flowers thinly cylindrical, the five lobes of either
rather long, comparatively narrow, hardly spreading; style
glabrous ; achenes narrow-cylindrical, scarce angular, quite
glabrous ; bristlets of the pappus numerous, almost biseriate,
nearly equal in length, almost plumously ciliate. In arid
calcareous tracts of country from the Wimmera, Darling, and
Murray Divers, extending westward as far as Eucla, the
northern limits of the species remaining hitherto unascer-
tained.
When the writer of these observations discovered already
in 1848 this remarkable plant, he placed it in the Cassinian
genus Eurybia (since reduced to Olearia and later still to
Aster), on account of great external resemblance to Aster
pimeloides, though at the time some abnormal characteristics,
such as the absence of ligulate corollas, were recognised and
subsequently recorded. The plant is now transferred to
the mainly tropical genus Pluchea, of which it is the most
southern species, although Pluchea Eyrea was traced, in
1851, also so far south as the apex of Spencer?s Gulf. For
including this plant in Pluchea it is however needful to
extend somewhat the limits of that genus, in as much as
each individual plant seems to produce within its involucres
one only of the two states of flowers, as only few flowers
occur in each involucre, as the flowers with imperfect anthers
produce also a five-lobed corolla, as the bristlets of the
pappus are very copious, therefore not uniseriate, and


moreover, long ciliated. Some degree of dioecism is
however characteristic also of P. tetranthera and P.
haccharoides, while pappus-bristlets in a single or in more
than one row, and with various extent of denticulation or
even ciliation, occur together in some other genera of
Composite, for instance, in Senecio. The remarkable
narrowness of the stigmata in our species, as well as their
structure, are quite in accord with Pluchea, so also the
sagittate base of the anthers, although the latter is reduced
to extreme minuteness. This Pluchea, however, connects the
genus evidently with the exclusively American Baccharis,
and a section in Pluchea, as Natho-Baccharis might be
established for it. The involucral bracts of P. conocephala
arise all closely together from the exceedingly small
receptacle; the corollas when dry are dull and dark-coloured
towards the summit, but may be purplish when fresh ;
those of the staminate flowers being shorter than those of
the others; the filaments are comparatively short; the
terminal plate of the anthers is almost semi-lanceolar ; the
stigmas of the flowers with rudimentary anthers are fully
exserted, those of the other kind of flower much enclosed
and thicker than in many other species; the achenes are
comparatively long. The pappus is almost that of Ptirigeron.
Additionally it may also here be noted, that Eurybia rudis
is transferable to Erigeron, in which genus it should form
a distinct section.
Remarks.
Baron von Mueller.? lnstead of reading my paper,
which is of an entirely technical character, I shall only make
a few remarks, especially as my essay is in process of being
incorporated in our Transactions.
The specimen in my hand, the Haloragis Haenerlein,
represents a plant entirely new to the flora of the Colony of
Victoria. It was found just on the boundary line near the
source of the Genoa River, by Mr. Haenerlin. It is note-
worthy, that it is not particularly allied to any indigenous
species from New South Wales or Tasmania, as might be
anticipated, but to one in West Australia. There are some
remarkable facts in connection with the geography of plants,
whichhave in instances like the present one, great significance.
It is rather an attractive plant, and it has come before me


more particularly, while, on special request from the Field
Naturalists? Club, I am elaborating the key to the system of
Victorian plants, so that during my investigations, those
forms which were not known before, had to be inserted.
This one was discovered while a special effort was made last
year to get the Eastern part of Gippsland phytologically
further explored.
The second plant, the Pluchea Conocephala, which I have
the honour of submitting, was collected as far back as 1848
by myself, on the Murray River. The species is not orna-
mental, but highly interesting. The plant for a long time
was only imperfectly known, and thus my original view of
its affinity remained adopted; but while some additional
material was coming in, I was in a better position to
investigate it, and found it belonged to the almost tropical
Pluchea, not yet on record as represented in Victoria, That
genus was named in memory of an amateur naturalist, the
Abbd Pluche, who lived about the middle of the last century.
I would remark, that the printing of the key to Victorian
Plants has actually commenced. I am aware that I have
tried rather sorely, the patience of those particularly
interested in this work; but the fact is this, the method
which the Hon. Dr. Dobson more especially desired to be
adopted is a very difficult one, requiring great care, much
time, and circumspect toil in working out. It is in accord
with the system, brought out first by the celebrated Lamarck,
at the end of the last century. The method is so difficult,
that unless very great caution is exercised, it is liable to
mislead, or to render the search for the names of plants even
bewildering ; therefore its practical application has very
seldom been attempted, and more particularly not over a
large area. The wider the area, the more difficult is the
task. The Rev. Mr. Spicer has with very praiseworthy zeal
undertaken such a dichotomous enumeration of the plants
of Tasmania, which comprises only about half the number
of our plants ; but although he did not work on a very
elaborate or strictly systematic plan, he experienced great
difficulties. Thus I found that I had to devote far more
research than I originally thought to the work desired; but
now it seems that I am gradually and successfully emerging
from what lat times thought would be a hopeless task. The
system to be adopted is a kind of dualism. It has to be
applied to 1900 different species of plants in Victoria, nearly
double as many as the plants of Great Britain and Ireland ;


and they have besides to be put into several hundred genera
and natural orders. Indeed, it proved a very complicated
effort.
The President said that the preparation of the dichotomous
key had been a very serious matter. It had been heard of
as having been in progress for a long time past, and he
trusted that when it was seen, it would be available to
everyone. Unfortunately, the Botanical and Biological
Section was rather thinly represented in that evening?s
meeting. The investigation of the flora of the Colony was
recorded in the Transactions, and gave great value to them
in the eyes of scientific men in other parts of the world.
