DEDICATION.
TO THE
ion. M. �. � alkg, JH.f .(E
Sir, ?
Permit me to express my deep sense of the honor you have
vouchsafed me of dedicating to you the following few pages, tire
merits of which will not, I much fear, compensate you for the
honor conferred.
The Rhymes (for I am well aware they are not entitled to be
called Poems) were not originally written with a view to
publication, but merely to keep myself from idleness in leisure
hours ; and it is only at the suggestion of a few friends that
1 now venture to offer them to the public.
Under these circumstances, I trust Sir that you, and indeed
all my readers, will not severely criticise my poor efforts, but
will kindly overlook the many faults which, doubtless, will be
met with throughout these compositions.
I have the honor to be,
Your obedient servant,
THE AUTHOR.
Sydney, January, 1880.




laments on Human His.
INTRODUCTION.
?The thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to.??Hamlet
4t To what unnumbered ills is flesh the heir ??
Exclaimed the Bard. How true, for lo ! where'er
We turn to gaze on frail humanity,
Despite its wealth?its pomp?its vanity?
We find affliction sent to visit all,
Be they high, low, rich, poor, or great or small ;
Or be they old or young, it matters not,
Ills they must bear, for ?tis decreed their lot.
Some from their cradle (by their Maker?s will)
To loss of precious sense or other ill
Have been subjected; not from want of love
By Him who made and sees them from above,
But for wise ends which He alone can know,
From whom both punishment and mercies flow.
Some may pass childhood?come to youth or age?
But must turn o?er th? inevitable page
Wherein ?tis writ ? Man is to trouble born,"
Nor can that page from their ? Fate Book ? be torn.
But, whilst our Human Nature may deplore,
That for our House of Clay ills are in store,
Yet, consolation should we take from this
Hereafter, we may gain eternal bliss.
Such promise teaches us, while we repine
Our present griefs, to kiss the rod Divine,
And strive, by faith, hope, love, and prayer to gain
That realm, where?s known ? no sorrow and no pain.?


Lament I
WRITTEN FOR A BLIND GENTLEMAN WHO LOST HIS
SIGHT AT THE AGE OF TEN YEARS.
? Let there be light!? the Cod of Life exclaimed?
And lo ! the mighty sun with radiance flamed,
Shedding throughout the universe its ray,
Converting darkness into glorious day.
Erst, when a child, I gazed upon its light,
But now, alas ! ?tis life-enduring night;
I yet can feel its genial warmth benign,
But doom?d no more on earth to see it shine.
My orbs of vision saw in days of yore,
That glory they will view again no more;
Neither the grandeur, elegance, and grace
Display?d in all God?s works, in every place; \
Never again, shall I, in life behold
Those beauties which both heaven and earth unfold ;
The moon?s soft beams, the stars so glitt?ring bright,
Spangling the sky and beautifying night;
The field?s bright verdure, or the flower?s soft hue,
The sea reflecting heaven?s ethereal blue ;
Nor yet those sights which oft on earth beguile
Our hearts of woe, ?A mother?s loving smile,
A sister?s laughing eye and blooming cheek,
Imparting all the joy which they bespeak ;
The noble works of sculpture and of art,
Unseen ?to me no pleasure can impart.
These, and a hundred more, I ne?er shall see,
Their contemplation is denied to me.
Must I not mourn with sorrow most intense,
My sad, sad loss of sight, that precious sense ?
Must I not mourn the loss of blessed light,
My stay on earth to be one life-long night ?
Must I not mourn that here I never can,
Before I die, behold the face of man ?
Must I not murmur against that decree
Which doom?d me never more on earth to see ?
Murmur against my Maker and my God ?
Or must I bow beneath his chast'ning rod ?


Oh ! yes, I will lament my hapless fate,
But never murmur ?gainst the Good and Great.
Submissively I?ll bend beneath the stroke,
And with unmurm?ring patience bear the yoke.
Lament 11.
ON A PERSON DEAF AND DUMB FROM BIRTH.
Sad, sad the thought, since first the breath of life
Enter?d thy frame?since first began thy strife
On this terrestial orb,? life?s troubled sea?
Hearing and speech have been denied to thee.
Poor mute ! deaf to the many charms that woo
The senses through the ear?dumb, speechless, too
Thou never heard?st a mother?s accents dear,
Striving thine infant heart to soothe or cheer,
Nor yet a father?s tones of praise or joy
Of his dear son, his own, his darling boy.
Nor did?st thou ever lisp thy childish prayer,
Kneeling, clasp?d-handed by thy mother's chair.
Shut out for all thy days from converse sweet
With all thy fellows ! or when loved ones greet,
Thy dull ear cannot drink their words of love,
Nor can thy lips speak greeting, though they move.
How vainly music?s strains seraphic swell ?
No more to thee than tolling of a knell.
The pealing organ?s solemn cadence,rolls
Unheeded by thee as the death bell tolls.
The orator or statesman may declaim, ?
To thee were they but puppets ?twere the same ;
To God the pastor?s voice is raised in prayer,
Within the House of God; the preacher there
Proclaims to all, ? Glad tidings of great joy,?
Which all shall share at last without alloy,
Who Jesus seek, and taking up his cross,
For His sake only, count all else as dross.
There, also, Christians high their voices raise,
And one and all unite in songs of praise.


But these, all these, upon thy dull ear fall
As vainly as a tear on funeral pall.
Nor can thy voice but add one note alone,
To those sweet praises rising to God?s throne.
But for all this, should?st thou lament, complain,
Say that thy lot?s unjust, charge God in vain ?
No, no ! Thou may?st indeed regret thy loss;
Think how much more Christ suffer?d on the cross,
How much on earth of grief and suff?ring too, ?
And all of it to save both me and you.
Then wherefore murmur ?gainst that God so good,
Who still provides thee with thy daily food,
Who sends the means where' >y thou can?st be taught
To know His love ?that thy salvation?s bought
With blood; His own Son?s blood, which has been
shed,
That thou to Him migh?st through that Son be led ?
Lament 111.
ON A PROMISING YOUTH WHO BECAME IDIOTIC AFTER
A SEVERE FEVER.
Oh ! great affliction, for some wise end sent,
Albeit, to serve what purpose it is meant
We know not; yet our Heavenly Father?s laws
Are fathomless ?for all He has a cause.
A few short months since thou wast blithe and gay,
Happy and joyful as the birds of May ;
The ardent blood of youth coursed through each vein f .
And active thought employ?d thy youthful brain,
When fell disease?the common lot of all,
Beneath whose chast?ning each in turn must fall
By its dire stroke subverted reason?s seat,
Erst with such bright intelligence replete,
And left a shatter?d frame?an aimless mind
A drivelling idiot?in its wreck behind.
Fair youth, thou dost not grieve nor yet complain
At what thou?st lost and never may?st regain,
For, happily, thy mem?ry can?t recall
That which thou wast before thy reason?s fall.


Thus art thou now - what migh?st thou not have been
Had?st thou this visitation never seen ?
Perchance, as poet, statesman, or divine,
Thy lot had been, as some bright light, to shine
Before the world; or in thy country?s cause
To aid thy fellow-men to frame her laws ;
Or e?en, perhaps, from pulpit to proclaim
Salvation?s tidings and Jehovah?s name.
But though thou can?st not murmur or lament,
That such affliction should to thee be sent,
Yet may not those of whom the joy, the pride,
1 hou wast ?thy friends, thy loving mother ?chide
God for the woe inflicted on their hearts,
The pangs, the pains, which that great grief imparts ?
Sorrow is human ?yea, let them lament,
But should they murmur, speedily repent?
Rememb?ring we are God?s, and His alone,
Bo do with as He will; we?re not our own.
Perhaps this youth has thus been saved from sin,
From earth?s temptations?thereby heav?n to win,
Having, as Lazarus, suffer?d evil things,
He may to heaven be borne on angels? wings.
Lament TV.
SUPPOSED TO BE WRITTEN IN HER LUCID MOMENTS BY
A LADY WHO BECAME DERANGED AFTER THE BIRTH
OF HER FIFTH CHILD.
Ah, me ! ah, me ! Yes, well I may be sad,
Kept here imprison?d?why ? They say Pm mad ;
But I?m not mad ; then why should I be here?-
Kept from my loved ones, from my children dear ?
And yet, ?tis like a dream?so dark, obscure, ?
But still, ?tis not so long ago I?m sure.
Who took my child, my baby, from my side,
And ran away with it, and tried to hide ?
Quick, bring it back at once, or else, ?O brain,
Peace, peace, be still. lam myself again.
And now, in calm reflection, I?ll renew
My efforts to bring back the past to view.


Yes, I remember well, ?twas once my lot
To dwell contented in my peaceful cot,
With my loved husband, and my children dear ?
How happily we lived for many a year !
Then my last darling came, and I was ill;
I rallied ; but, my cup of grief to fill,
Though sickness left me it impaired my brain.
Oh, better had it been to suffer pain
Than to be torn away from those fond hearts,
Whose tenderness, in pain, relief imparts.
I must deplore, lament my hapless fate,
That I, so happy, blithe, and gay, of late,
Should be, by God?s unjust and stern decree,
Kept here, whilst all my loved ones still are free.
Hush, sinful heart, and do not charge thy God
With foul injustice, for his chast?ning rod
Falls on the just and on the unjust too
This one to warn, and that one?s heart renew.
For whom he loveth him He chasteneth most,
And scourgeth every son lest he be lost.
They say that had I not been here restrain d
My hands ere this might have with blood been stain?d ;
That blood my infant?s ! Though I sorrow now
For loss of liberty, I?ll meekly bow
To God?s almighty power and sovereign will,
And should my heart rebel, say, ? Peace, be still !?
Lament V.
ON A CRIPPLE, AN OLD SOLDIER.
In childhood?s happy days, my little feet,
In pretty little shoes so smart and neat,
Patter?d about. My little childish heart,
So full of joy and free from sorrow?s smart;
My little mind, devoid of every thought
Of care and trouble with which life is fraught;
I reck?d not then the evils that might come,
Nor when nor what, nor what might be their sum,
?Twas nought but childish gladsomeness and glee,
Pattering, dancing at my mother?s knee.


My boyhood reached, with sturdy, active limb,
I loved athletic sport, to race, to swim,
To leap and jump, and scamper o?er the hill;
Or make the hay, or help the ground to till.
My joyous heart as yet had known no grief
But what was boyish, evanescent, brief;
My mind, untrammell?d by all worldly care,
Was calm, serene, and buoyant as the air
Unthought of all the ills I yet might meet
My joys to crush, ray happiness defeat.
And then, at length, to man?s estate I came,
Robust and hardy, looking up to fame;
Longing for reputation and renown?
For worldly praises and for glory?s crown;
To serve my country in her army?s ranks,
To earn her eulogy and gain her thanks.
With this desire I sought a soldier?s life,
And met the foe in battle?s deadly strife; .
Lost both?my limbs and gained not what I sought,
Albeit I bravely fell and bravely fought.
They say that God is watchful over all;
Oh ! wherefore then was I allow?d to fall,
Thus maim?d, to eke out my declining years
Of life in this cold, cheerless vale of tears ?
I must bewail this melancholy end
Of my once happy life. Yet will I bend
In meek submission to th? Almighty?s will,
And humbly bear this visitation still ;
For whilst He chasten?d, yet, He mercy sent
And spared my life, that I might yet repent
Of sins, which had for ever wreck?d my soul,
That thus I might attain the Heavenly goal.
Lament VI.
03 A YOUNG LADY, THE LAST OF FOUR SISTERS, WHO
ALL DIED OF CONSUMPTION BEFORE THEY WERE
TWENTY YEARS OF AGE.
Must I, so young, bid this fair earth adieu ?
My pilgrimage so short, my years so few ?


Touch?d by the unrelenting hand of death,
Must I obey his call?yield up my breath ?
The pleasures of this life untasted yet,
Can I relinquish it without regret ?
Can I, without a pang, depart from earth,
Leaving behind me those who gave me birth ?
Mourning o?er me and o?er those sisters dear,
Who used their griefs to calm, their hearts to cheer.
But ?tis my sad inheritance, alas !
My destiny - from me this cup can?t pass
Unless I drink it. Ah ! I must lament,
Thus early, that my earthly hopes be rent.
But though lamenting, yet I murmur not
That such an early grave should be my lot.
God only knows for he alone is wise,
Wherefore hereditary ailment lies
Rooted through generations. Can it be
His visitation for th? iniquity
Of fathers on the children ? We know not;
Enough for us to know He casts our lot.
Farewell, fair earth, soon shall I quit thy shore,
Ne?er look upon thy beauties any more.
Farewell, majestic ocean, farewell, sky,
With all thy gorgeous glitt?ring panoply.
When this mortal tenement of clay
Lies ?neath the sod, oh, may eternal day,
Bright and unclouded, dawn upon my soul,
When days, and years, and seasons cease to roll,
With grief and trials ever in their train ;
When I shall weep no more, fear no more pain.
Let me not, then, grieve for that parting hour,
When the dark clouds of death appear to lour !
They?ll soon disperse ?and then, calm, peaceful, bright,.
Will shine upon me everlasting light;
Then will the Son of Righteousness, who brings
To the afflicted healing in his wings,
From His eternal throne in Heav?n arise
And wipe away all tears from my eyes.

WRITTEN BY REQUEST.
GRATITUDE.
To utter words of thanks with silvery voice,
To smile complacently upon a friend,
At kindness shewn, to seem that we rejoice,
And formal bow with formal accent blend;
To strive by stiff formality, to lend
Truth to our feelings and our hearts unfold,
Whilst all we say or do we but pretend ;
This is not Gratitude?Tis but around
Hypocrisy's black form, Deceit?s dark cloak to fold.
But, ?mid the happiness and joy we feel,
Whilst both our words and smiles our thanks convey,
And the heart too has nothing to conceal,
No cold indifference its warmth to stay,
But truly feels, that which the lips but say ;
A feeling heavenly, with love endued,
Not evanescent, fading in a day,
But with faithful truthfulness imbued,
Is not hypocrisy ?This, this is Gratitude.
Prologue.
WRITTEN FOR AN AMATEUR THEATRICAL BENEFIT
PERFORMANCE.
Kind friends, it gives us very great delight,
To see so many of you here to-night.
Because the cause which now we strive to aid,
Deserves your best support. The effort made
By us, your presence here has well repaid.


But, ere our troupe appears upon these boards ;
Ere the scene shifters pull the fatal cords,
And raise these curtains, which just now conceal
Our Amateurs, (Oh dear, how queer they feel !)
I wish to ask you not to be severe
Upon their faults, or they?ll break down I fear ;
But, with your kind encouragement, I trust
They will, with laughter, almost make you hu'st.
This term is slang I know, but pray excuse it,
To make the rhyme I was obliged to use it.
Our gentlemen will do their best to please,
Our ladies too, though feeling ill at ease.
For gentlemen our ladies? parts sustain,
And ladies? voices they perforce must feign,
No easy task?and awkward they must feel,
In ladies? dresses, and in hoops of steel.
Thus, tho? great difficulties in our way
Have been presented, getting up this play??,
We?ve done?t in full assurance that from you,
We?d meet with every indulgence too.
No more?You grow impatient, I?ll away
To have the curtain drawn ; commence the play.
On the Death of a much respected Lady.
Freed from its prison house ol mouldering clay,
The happy Spirit speeds upon its way
To those bless?d realms, where all is peace and love
The glorious mansions of its God above.
Gone to that bourne from whence there?s no return.
Whilst, resting ?neath the cold sepulchral urn,
The body, free from worldly care and ill,
Awaits the issue of its Maker?s will.
Dark is the prospect of the sinful soul,
Doom?d never to attain that blissful goal;
That of the righteous Spirit, Oh ! how fair,
To share the triumph and the glory there,
In anguish, this one quits its house of clay,
The dreaded penalty of sin to pay;


That one but sinks into a peaceful sleep,
Whilst bright robed Seraphs, vigils o?er it keep.
For this one, well may sorrow fill the mind
Of those on earth whom it has left behind.
For that, no need to grieve or be distress?d,
?Tis gone but to enjoy its heavenly rest.
The loss of one, who, through her earthly life,
As friend, as sister, mother and as wife ;
In each relationship, in every need,
Was ever kindly both in word and deed,
We now lament?her gentle Spirit?s fled.
Alas ! Alas ! She?s number?d with the dead.
But why alas ???Tis but the body dies,
Her Spirit lives with Angels in the skies ;
With them its praises sings, and treads with them.
The golden streets of New Jerusalem.
Should we then mourn or murmur or complain,
Or wish her back upon this earth again ?
I his earth, so full of trouble and of woe.
No ! rather seek where she is gone to go,
?Tis true, ?tis hard, for man to part on earth,
With those he loves, perhaps has loved from birth
Let him reflect that they are not his own.
But that they are his God?s and His alone;
Who lends, but does not give them to retain,
And when He wants them, takes them back again,
1 here was a man, ?Oh ! that we all might be
Like him in patience and humility,?
Who, when his God deprived him of his all
And sore afflicted, murmured not at all,
But praised his God for all that he had done,
Made no complaint, nor even thought of one;
Then as he said, so also should we saj',
? The Lord gave and the Lord hath ta?en away,
Praised be his name.??His will let us obey.


Acrostic to Charles.
ADDICTED TO INTEMPERANCE.
Can man not resist temptation ?
How can that infatuation,
Arising from the power of liquor,
Rising quicker, ever quicker,
Leaving nought but grief behind it,
Ever make man seek to find it ?
Satan?s is the call. Men mind it ! !
Prologue.
WRITTEN FOR THE OPENING NIGHT OF AN AMATEUR
DRAMATIC CLUB.
Kind friends and patrons, on our opening night,
It gratifies us to behold the sight
Of such a fair assemblage as we view
Before us now. Encouraged thus by you,
Our future efforts in the Thespian art
(If you your kind support will still impart,)
Shall be to merit your continued aid,
And strive that all our plays, shall be well played.
Our foremost aim, will be a careful guard
Against vulgarity and to discard
Whate?er to any might offensive prove,
And aught objectionable to remove
From our selections and our actions too, ?
Which grieve the many and please but a few.
There is a saying most of you may know,
? Rome was not built in one day.? Even so,
We trust, that you will not from us expect
Perfection all at once, ?but will reflect,
That as ?twas years before that city rose
To eminence, so you will not suppose,
That we at once spontaneously shall rise
Accomplished actors. Far as in us lies
However, we shall use our utmost skill
To please our audience and our house to fill;
To improve our style and merit your applause,


And give our aid to every worthy cause.
We crave your kind indulgences for those,
On whom we may from time to time, impose
The task to represent our ladies? parts,
Without the graces and the pleasing arts
The gentler sex possess, ?tis hard for man
To do them justice, do whate?er he can.
I fear I?ve tired you with my long address,
But pray that your displeasure you?ll repress.
To make amends, I will at once be gone,
And then, directly, have the curtains drawn.
Friendship.
There is, akin to love, a feeling which
Knits heart to heart amongst both poor and rich,
Which makes us able to enjoy this life
In calm serenity, abhorring strife.
?Tis Friendship, blessed Friendship, heaven born;
More rich and rare than any jewel worn.
He who has quaff?d of Friendship?s crystal cup,
Can seldom with indifference give it up;
He who has once the bond of Friendship seal?d,
Can seldom to unfriendly feeling yield.
How many but for Friendship would be lost,
When to and fro upon life?s ocean toss?d,
Or when upon the perilous brink they stand,
Of life?s great river, are by Friendship?s hand,
Saved from that fall by which but for her aid.
They might beneath the current have been laid.
Oh ! who can e?er deny, ? a friend in need,?
Is also of a truth, ? a friend indeed.?
But not alone in such an hour as this,
Is she the welcome harbinger of bliss ;
But at all seasons, be we rich or poor,
We gladly hail her footsteps at our door,
We seize her hand with happy grateful hearts,
For the true warmth which she to them imparts.
Hail ! then thou sacred feeling; Friendship bless?d ;
Come to my heart, ?repose thee in my breast.


An Angel of Earth,
How rare to find the human form
With Angel nature gifted ;
Beyond the reach of passions? storm,
By heavenly pureness lifted ;
To find a heart within the breast,
In every act revealing,
That ?tis with angel love impress?d,
With pure and holy feeling.
Yet have I met with such an one,
Endow?d with heaven?s blessing,
Who ne?er by word, by action none,
To others was distressing ;
But strove by guarded act and thought,
To win all hearts around her,
And thus their true affection sought,
Whilst to their hearts they bound her.
An earthly Angel truly she ;
One out of very many;
This Angel of the earth, ?tis thee,
Dear thoughtful, feeling, Jenny.
Acrostic.
THE DESTRUCTION AND FALL OF
Judgment?s foretold and soon shall be fulfill?d;
E?en now, the prophecy shall be reveal?d.
Romans advance ?War clamours?all is still?d.
Under the Conqueror?s yoke now must thou yield;
Sadness must reign where once were joy and pride ;
And slavery, where all were once so free;
Laughter and mirth be hush?d ?neath sorrow?s tide,
Ended thy fame ; thine end captivity.
Mark now, the prophecy fulfill?d on thee.


Judgment?s fulfilled ; by prophecy foretold.
Entire destruction was thy fated doom ;
Retribution for thy sins of old ;
Unhappy city ! Veil?d in deepest gloom ;
So happy once, so proud, so rich, so fair,
Among the nations, favor?d above all.
Look now upon thy ruins, and see where
Each stone cast down is witness to thy fall.
Mark these! And then the prophecy recall.

JEliscellanea.
Whet is Life ?
Oh! what is life??l see, each day,
From earth so many pass away ;
I hear them say, that, ? he is dead,? ?
Or that, ? her gentle spirit?s fled.??
I hear it said, ??this happy soul
Has gone to its most blissful goal ?
? That darling infant?s certain fate,
Is passage through the heavenly gate.?
Whilst that one?s bourne they dread to tell,
But trust he may be saved from hell.?
But what is life??and what man?s lot ?
This life on earth, his nursling cot.
His body?s lot he knows?decay ;
His spirit?s lot ! he cannot say
What that may be, because he knows
Nor whence it came, nor where it goes.
Ethereal as the winds that blow,
Whence do they come or whither go ?
This mouldering mass of crumbling clay,
Of dust, which we behold to-day
Strutting ?mongst other lumps of earth,
Professing ?tis of better birth
Than they, whilst ?tis the self-same rubble,
Like them an evanescent bubble,
To-morrow may be buried, burnt;
How shall it then boast what it learnt ?
The earthly frame ne?er learnt at all,
That frame was only built to fall.
Man?s body lives not, ?tis a shell,
Wherein a Spirit?s sent to dwell;
That Spirit, not the body, lives;
That Spirit only ?tis, that gives


The body power to move, to act;
But, when by human ills attacked,
And God his heavy judgment deals
To man, the life, the Spirit feels,
Until the shell is broken, crushed ;
And once again returns to dust;
Then quitting it, the tenant soul
Shall seek a happier, better goal.
The Spirit dies not, ?tis set free,
To seek a bless?d eternity.
Lines to a Rose.
WITHERING IN A GLASS.
Queen of the Garden, most exquisite Rose,
Unsurpassed both in beauty and grace,
The delicate tint on thy cheek which now glows,
Tis sad cruel man should efface.
As a bud, thou wert beautiful, ere thou wast born;
In bursting, more beautiful still;
Then full-blown?when, alas! Thou art doom?d to be
shorn,
To gratify man?s fitful will.
Relentless, he tears thee aw r ay from thy stem,
Where erst thou w r ert blooming and gay,
And seeks to deprive thee of life, and condemn
Thee to wither and fade and decay,
Ere nature, who nurtured thee, destined thy fall,
When thy fragrance was balmy and sw r eet,
When thy beautiful grace was admired by all,
And thine odours our senses did greet.
But now r , lovely flower, how ?oon must thou die ?
No longer wilt gladden our light;
Thy soft tints will vanish, thy fragrance will fly,
No longer our senses delight.
Thou may?st struggle for life, but the eflbrt is vain,
Thy life-sap no longer can flow;
Man has robb?d thee of that he can ne?er give again,
Of the life he can never bestow.


And thus has the pleasure he might have enjoy?d?
Long on thy beauty to gaze
For one which so quickly must end, been destroy?d,
To look on thy form in a vase.
Acrostic.
TO MINNIE
?M id all the glitt?ring summer flowers
I n Flora?s sweet Elysian bowers,
N one more charming can I see,
N one more blooming fair than thee.

Each flower to thee the palm must yield.

To an Early Violet.
?I welcome - , thy coming, thou beautiful thing,
Revealing so sweetly the birth of the spring.
All hail to thy fragile and delicate form,
So like to the sunbeam succeeding the storm.
How brightly in thee, hath thy Maker depicted
A message of hope to the sad and afflicted.
Thou art come in thy beauty, an exquisite token,
Breathing joy to the hearts that were wounded and
broken ;
Thou art come, as the day springeth after the night,
Dispelling the gloom which hath hidden the light.
Sweet flower of the lowly, all hail to thy birth !
Thou art welcome, thou beautiful child of the earth.

TO PHCEBE
Pleasant it is, both heart and mind at ease,
H ush?d every sound, ?list?ning, as through the trees
<E olian music floats on every breeze ;
But sweeter, more enchanting sounds to me
Each silvery accent which proceeds from thee.


Thoughtless Words.
Often a thoughtless speech may jar
The feeling heart?s too supple cords ;
A careless word may often mar
The joy society affords.
In company, perchance there may
Be one whose heart may erst have known,
Grief for some dear one snatched away,
From friends by death relentless torn.
There may be one who once was rich,
Deprived of fickle fortune?s aid,
Has met with sore reverse, by which
He?s been to poverty conveyed.
There may be one of gentler sex,
Who once love?s tender passion knew,
Who thought her lover ne?er could vex,
Nor hurt, nor slight, nor prove untrue ;
But yet whose fondest hopes were vain?
Never to be realized ;
Whilst she must mourn, in grief and pain,
Loss of the love she dearly prized.
Knowingly to touch the spring
Which vibrates painful to such hearts
Is cruel, ?cruel ?tis to bring
To mem?ry that which pain imparts.
Unwitting cruelty, by thoughtless speech,
Will cause a pang which thought would spare ;
Reflection, then, should surely teach,
That speaking, we should speak with care.
A Cure for Heart Disease.
STRONGLY RECOMMENDED TO YOUNG L\DIES
Young lady, if troubled with heart disease,
Try this prescription if you please.
Of common sense, take just two grains,
With Oil of Contentment,?(stir with pains,)
A drachm of the Spirit of Cheerfulness,
Mix?d with neither more nor less,


Then a pint of water from Pleasure?s Stream,
And add a spoonful of Humour?s Cream,
Take a draught whenever the fits come on.
And you 11 find the complaint will soon be gone
Floral Life Emblems-
THE PRIMROSE.
Thus art thou now, in the flush of spring,
A laughter-loving and guileless thing,
Breathing around thee nought but glee,
From a spirit bounding wild and free ;
Passing thy life from hour to hour
Kissing the sweets of every flower.
But bear in mind, as the season?s roll,
1 here are changes, too, for the human soul.
THE ROSE,
The flowers of summer have yet to blow,
With their varied colors and tinted glow?;
But the fresh?ning breeze ot the spring is o?er,
I hey droop, they fade, and they laugh no more.
And those more strong may bloom for a while,
Al the past and the future may proudly smile;
Let them bear in mind as the seasons roll,
There are changes, too, for the human soul.
THE SEARED LEAF.
Autumn comes and the withering leaf,
Telling a tale of the past with grief;
The green is seared and its beauty flown :
Thus thou?lt trace in its fate thine own.
I hou may?st escape the autumn blast,
One season more, and the whole is past.
?Tis nature?s cry. as the season?s roll,
I here are changes, too, for the human soul.


THE DEAD LEAF.
Old winter conies with his hoary head,
Sweeping us all with the mighty dead ;
But long ere this thou?lt know the world,
And thy banner of ills will have been unfurl?d,
In the withered cheek and the sunken e) e
Thou?lt see no trace of the days gone by;
And, oh ! thou?lt find, as the seasons roll,
There are changes, too, for the human soul.
A Musical Acrostic.
P LAiNUVE and soft, the
I n strains seraphic rise,
A nd lo ! sweet melody resounds,
Now mounting to the skies;
On sinful earth they will not rest,
F rom sinful man they flee ;
Onward they go to join the blest,
Rich Heavenly minstrelsy ;
To swell the praises of the Great
Eternal God above ;
Happy around his throne to wait,
A nd praise Him for His love.
Rich, rare, are those celestial chords,
Pure, holy, unrestrain?d,
V aster than this frail earth affords,
I n unison maintained.
On earth man hears no strains like those
L oud anthems angels raise,
I n soft, sweet melody ?he knows
N one like their songs of praise.
' Far, further still, in boundless space,
L oud, louder yet they swell,
Upwards to the Throne of Grace,
T hen down to nether hell!
Even the evil spirits there


C an hear that Heavenly strain,
L ash?d by the flames, in sad despair,
A nd writhing in their pain.
Repentant now they are, too late,
I n everlasting woe ;
Oh ! dreadful, dreadful ! ??tis their fate,
N e?er peace or rest to know.
Eternal misery their doom,
Thrust out from heavenly bliss ;
D own in those depths within whose gloom
R ed fires dance and hiss;
Upward they gaze, and pray in vain?
M ercy God ne?er will show' again !
Oh let us live, so we may die
Righteous in our Maker?s sight;
G lad anthems then we?ll sing on high,
A nd join in praise, with heart and might,
N ear God, in heaven?s eternal light!
Character of a Youngf Lady
WHOM THE AUTHOR NEVER SAW.
( Written for aft tend, from his deserif tion of her.)
My muse delights to celebrate
Thy praises in her song ;
My mind delights to contemplate
The graces which belong
To thee, whose character I paint,
Where virtue all abounds,
And where no vicious feelings taint,
But all that?s good is found.
Whose temper is as sweet and mild,
As graceful is thy form,
Never disturb'd or driven wild
By passion?s fitful storm ;
Whose heart is ever light and kind,
As rich in joy and love,
As is thy cultivated mind
With rich gifts from above.


Whose nature is as good and pure
As angel forms in heaven ;
Whose friendship is both firm and sure,
Void of deceitful leaven.
Alas ! my Muse no words can find
Sufficient to pourtray
Thy character, wherein combined,
All that is good holds sway.
No marvel, then, as such, thou art
(So pure, so undefiled)
The idol of a father?s heart,
A mother?s darling child.
Moonlight Reflections.
I court ye, gentle moonlight hours
When tired nature seeks repose,
When heaven?s dews refresh the flowers,
And soft the balmy zephyr blows.
Nature?s restorer, gentle sleep,
The happy death of each day?s life ;
Balm of hurt minds, to those who weep
The end of each day?s painful strife.
So speaks the bard of that sweet rest,
When souls, from earthly care set free,
And watch?d by Spirits of the Bless?d,
Seek glimpses of eternity.
?Tis in these tranquil hours of night,
When all around is hush?d and still
Nought heard unless the beetle?s flight,
Or murm?ring of a distant rill,
That I delight to meditate
On one, whose form, by fancy traced,
Before me stands. To contemplate
The charms by which that form is graced
The fairy step, so agile, light,
So delicate the hand of snow,
The loving eyes, so mild, so bight,
The locks so rich, the cheeks? soft glow ;


The music of that silvery voice,
So full of harmony, so clear,
Replete with melody as choice
As ever greeted human ear.
Reflection leads me on to think
Of all the bliss which might be mine,
Were it the will of Fate to link
Our hands and hearts, our joys combine.
Pale Cynthia peacefully looks down,
Shedding her silvery radiance ?round ;
Nought seems upon my hopes to frown,
No fears within my heart are found.
The little, merry twinkling stars.
With mischief winking as they shine,
Seem whispering ; ? There are no bars
Against thy hopes?she shall be thine??
Imagination onward leads ;
Methinks I boldly seek her hand,
And n-xt, the greater joy succeeds ?
Plighted our troths, beside her stand.
Reflection now flies swiftly on,
Attain?d my dearest wish in life :
The moon?s at rest, the stars are gone,
But she remains my own, ?my wife !
Somebody's Darling.
She?s ? Somebody?s Darling,? but no matter whose,
I?m not going to tell you, because I don?t choose;
Somebody loves her, I shall not say who,
Because who is that somebody?s nothing to you.
It may be her mother, or sister, or brother?
If neither of these, then perhaps it?s another;
Who that other may be I am not going to tell,
More than this ?it?s a person I know very well.
She?s ?Somebody?s Darling,? this there?s no disputing;
That this somebody loves her there is no refuting;
With love, perhaps, greater than that of a brother,
And equal to that of a sister or mother.


Shes ??Somebody?s Darling,? I must say this much,
If a lady, indeed then she?s bless?d to have such ;
But if a gentleman, happy his lot,
hor a more precious darling I?m sure there is not.
She?s ? Somebody?s Darling,? but not yours I know?
Although, I dare say, you may wish it were so.
Whoever it may be need never repine ;
But she?s ? Somebody?s Darling??perhaps it is mine.

Prologue.
WRITTEN ON THE OCCASION OF A DRAMATIC
ENTERTAINMENT BY THE PUPILS AT THE WEST
OF ENGLAND INSTITUTION FOR THE DEAF AND
DUMB.
Permit me first, e'er yet our band appear,
To wish you joy of the forthcoming year ;
To bid you welcome, and our sense convey
Of the great honor which you do our play.
Also to ask the indulgence of your smile
To help our humour, and assist our style,
To leave a moment the stern critic?s part,
And look with kindness on our youthful art.


Remember that ?tis few the sacred fire
Of genius kindles; few such thoughts inspire
As raised a Roscius to that matchless fame,
Which gilds his memory and embalms his name.
We are, alas ! denied the power of words
To tune our eloquence in Attic chords ;
Yet think not because sound is wanting here
Our voice is powerless. No ! though to the ear
It vainly comes, yet still the eye
Can drink its beauty, and its thought apply.
And if ?tis true, as history?s pages tell,
That gesture once from words ? bore off the bell,
When Greek met Greek upon Athenas? stage,
And the great contest did the learn?d engage.
Let us then hope for one short hour or two
In our mute language we may speak to you.
We hope not high on Thespian wings to soar,
We seek to amuse you, and we ask no more.
We leave to others, greater minds than ours,
To move your passions, and improve your powers,
Enough for us, if fn r one hour of life,
We wean your thought from out its anxious strife,
Bring you awhile back to those halcyon days
Of youthful joys, and schoolboy holidays,
When Christmas spreads his festive board around.
And care no seat about our hearth has found,
When friends meet friends the festal cup to quaff,
And sire and son join in the jocund laugh,
When Lords and Masters lay their power aside,
Mix in the revels, and forget to chide.
Let then our welcome e?er be warm and dear
To merry Christmas and the new-born year;
And may we all who meet in joy to-night,
Meet oft again to hail them with delight.?


To a Lady.
WITH A PAIR OF GLOVES IN PAYMENT OI A I.OSI BET.
The gloves enclosed I send to pay
The wager I lost the other day,
That Sunday last it would be wet ;
But being fine I lost the bet.
I did not know the size to buy,
But guess?d it,?so you?ll please to try
If they will fit; if large or small,
Perhaps you?ll be so good as call
At , in Hunter-street, and there
They?ll change them for another pair.
I am, in all sincerity,
Most truly yours,

Moonlight on the Water.
SUGGESTED BY A MOONLIGHT TRIP FROM PARRAMAI IA
TO SYDNEY.
The moonbeams are dancing,
The starlight is glancing,
From ripple to ripple the wavelets to kiss,
Like water nymphs taking
Their pastime and making
Merrv, resolved every care to dismiss.
The moon and stars shining,
Their radiance combining,
Aid the sweet pleasures their offspring enjoy,
Whilst the breezes for cooling
Their ball-room, and ruling
The maze of their dances their eftorts employ.
Mark how they are flitting,
Bright sparkles emitting,
Disappearing, returning, now here and then there ;
The waters are flashing,
Their white crests are plashing,
As in the gay revel they joyously share.


On th? stream?s banks are gleaming
The trees brightly beaming,
As if steeped in silver the scene to enhance ;
To the gentle wind bending,
As though intending
To unite with the rest in the gay festive dance.
Then the music so thrilling,
And everywhere filling
The air with its melody, soft and yet wild ;
Tis the breeze which is singing,
Whilst the waters are ringing
In CEolian strains, now full and then mild.
In delight I stand list?ning,
And view the stream glist?ning,
As onward the barque swiftly speeds on her way ;
Entranced and admiring
The scene, so inspiring,
And almost desiring it ne?er might be day.
An Enigma.
Attached to Royalty in Courts I?m seen,
But never yet was found with king or queen ;
I govern all republics and all realms,
I man all frigates, but can?t take their helms;
The army claims me and all soldiers too,
The navy does not, but the sailors do,
No ship without me can complete her crew.
I?m found in minerals, in the midst of th? earth,
And help to cause both fruitful crops and dearth ;
And take part in all misery and mirth
The Church and all her Clergy claim me too, ?
I?m owned by all your friends, but not by you,
And yet, by every reader I?m possessed,
So strive good reader, till my name you?ve guessed.


THE SPANIARD OF THE COTE D?OR.
Having occasion in the summer of the year 1844, to
take a journey into the north of Italy, 1 started from
the island of Jersey, where I had been for some time
residing, via Granville, a dirty little port on the French
coast, for which the steamers plied from that island, en
route for Paris, where I proposed stopping for a few
days. In due course I reached the French capital,
and after having once more run over its principal attrac-
tions (for I had frequently visited it before) I again took
my leave ? en diligence? for Chalons sur Saone. from
which place I purposed taking water by the rivers
Saone and Rhone, as far as Avignon, en route for Nice.
We started from Paris in one of the diligences of the
� Messageries Royale de Laffite et Gaillard,? some-
what uncomfortably full. I had intended travelling
in the ? Coupe'e? but was too late to secure any place
except one in the ? interieur,? which I was compelled
to take, or postpone my departure, which I did not
wish to do; accordingly, at the appointed hour I took
my seat in the ? inte'rieure?. Those who know what
a French diligence is, may picture to themselves what
a delightful position I was in, huddled up together
with four dirty Frenchmen, two women, (one of them
a Falstaff in petticoats) and a squalling brat of a child.
What with the weather, (mid-July) and the number of
passengers, it was quite impossible to bear the win-
dows up, and when they were down, such volumes of
dust entered the coach as to be sufficient not merely
to choke us all, but positively to bury us, and glad
enough was I as you may imagine, when, in the early
part of the night, we reached the foot of the aclivity
known as the Cote d?Or, over which we had to pass,
and at which my tale commences.
At the bottom of the hill the diligence pulled up,
in order to allow those passengers who felt so inclined,
to get out and walk up the ascent; of course I was one
of the number who availed themselves of the opportu-
nity thus afforded of breathing the fresh air, shaking


off the dust, and stretching the legs. Not feeling at
all anxious to form the acquaintance of any of my fel-
low-travellers, I walked on at a brisk pace before the
diligence, when I had gained about a hundred yards
on the vehicle, I overtook a man who was walking
leisurely up the hill and whom I took to be a peasant,
he being habited in that garb. Feeling somewhat dry,
owing to the powdered state of my throat, I addressed
him, ? Mon ami pouvez vous me direc ou I?on vend du
cidre sur cette cote ?? ? Can you tell me my friend
where they sell cider on this hill?? ?Dans une petite
auberge a deux cent pas d?ici, monsieur.????At a road-
side inn about two hundred paces from here sir,? was
the reply.?? Thank you,? I replied in French, and
enquired, ?Do you belong to this mountain ???? I
live on the mountain sir, and during the season am
much engaged in the manufacture of cider, for which
it is so famous, but I am not a native of this part of
the country nor even of France.? ?? Indeed,? I replied,
? then I suppose the badness of the times in your own
country obliged you to go and seek your fortune else-
where ???? No senor, I regret to say that, ?here is
the auberge, Senor,??? Come in then with me my
friend, and take a cup to your future success in the
road to fortune,? I rejoined, for I began to perceive by
his general deportment that this man was, or had been,
something better than a mere peasant, and abo ob-
served by the latter part of his conversation and his
accent, that he was a Spaniard. A feeling of curiosity
now came over me, and 1 was exceedingly desirous of
prying into his past career and of gleaning something
of his history. At first he seemed anxious to avoid
being placed under any manner of obligation, and de-
clined going into the auberge, but as I insisted, he
acquiesced. We entered, and after having partaken of
a glass of the prime cider of the Cote d?Or, and having
put a bottle of it in my pocket to wash down the dust
during the remainder of my journey, I again sallied
forth with my new acquaintance ; just as we reached
the door of the auberge the diligence came up, and


as it always made a point of halting there for ten
minutes or a quarter of an hour, to water the horses,,
and I may perhaps add to cider the passengers, we had
a tolerably good start of it before it again resumed its
onward course. As soon as we had proceeded a short
distance, being particularly desirous of knowing more
about this man?s history ; without a second prelude I
at once opened the conversation where he had left off.
? You were about to tell me the cause of your leaving
your native land, which, from your accent I conclude
is Spain.??? It is, Senor,? he replied, ?lam by birth
a Spaniard. The reason why I was forced to quit my
native country was, I regret to say, my want of self
command. In this country I call myself Pierre Bar-
don, but my right name is Pedro di Bardoni, My
father who was one of the richest men in Salsona, and
whose name I bear, being his only son, died many
years ago, leaving me the whole of his property with
the exception of an annuity of some five thousand
francs which he bequeathed to my only sister. Within
twelve months after my father?s death, my sister, who
had been engaged prior to that event, married with
one Don Alphonso di Cavarari, a young man of high
birth and large property. Shortly after her marriage,
being one evening at an entertainment at her house,
I there met a friend, Don Sebastiano D?Argano, with
whom in the course of the evening I engaged in a
friendly game at cards. After playing some time and
invariably losing, I began to get out of temper, at last,
I exclaimed, *? one game more and if I lose by this, by
heaven, I?ll play no more.? The game was played
and I lost. I rose from the table hastily and threw
down the cards in a passion, ray friend laughed at me
enraged at the thought of being first beaten and then
laughed at, in the heat of the moment and as he was
rising from his seat, 1 raised my arm and dealt him
such a blow with my clenched fist as to knock him
flat upon his back. As soon as he had recovered from
the effects of the blow, he arose, and after calmly
picking up the small table at which we had been play-


ing, and which he had overthrown in his fall, he made
a bow and left the room. As soon as he was gone my
friends censured my conduct, and upbraided me for
my want of self-control, and I admitted that I was in
fault, but we had not had much time to talk of the
matter, when a servant entered the room and informed
me that a gentleman wished to speak to me. I left
the room and on reaching the house door I found a
young man closely wrapped in a large cloak, and with
his hat drawn down over his brows. As soon as he
perceived that we were alone, he threw back his cloak
and raising his hat, discovered himself to be Don
Sebastiano. ? Pedro,? he said, ?we have for many
years been on friendly terms, but this night our friend-
ship is dissolved for ever. I have received at your
hands a blow?a vile blow ?which I cannot do other-
wise than resent, so now let us at once go and settle
this business, for one of us must perish.? ? But my
dear Sebastiano,? I rejoined?? Hold? k he exclaimed in
a commanding voice, ?I will hear no apology, ?none,
I have been to-night grossly insulted, and nought
shall satisfy me but your blood ?come then at once,
?here I have swords??and he produced them from
the folds of his cloak. Maddened that he should be
so unwilling to hear ray apology, all friendship ap-
peared to cease at once in me likewise, so snatching
up my hat and cloak I followed him. We soon
reached a secluded spot, my sister?s house being some-
what out of the town. The swords were measured
.and we took our stands. After several ineffectual
passes he planted the point of his rapier in my thigh
I hardly felt it ?he seemed for a moment flurried
so taking advantage of the opportunity, I made a
?violent thrust at him and my instrument found its way
to his breast; he dropped his sword, staggered back,
reeled and fell heavily to the earth. For a minute I
stood aghast, then I went over and looked at him.
The moon shone full upon his features which were
pale, and his eyes were closed ?he was dead ! In a
half shrieking voice I exclaimed, ? Sebastiano you are


satisfied.? I left him and began running, when I heard
a voice call after me ? I know you Pedro di Bardoni
?you shall answer for this!?
It was now evident that I must leave Saloona, and
even Spain. But how could I do this without first
seeingand taking leave of Donna Angela di Mendocini?
No; it could not be. But then, how should I
contrive to see her ? Our occasional interviews were
quite secret, her father having rejected me as a suitor
and denied me his house. At this moment I recog-
nised the voice which had called after me when I left
Don Sebastiano; it had been that of Don Emanuel di
Mendocini. In the necessity of the moment a scheme
occurred to me which I resolved at once to put into
execution. I went direct to his house and knocked
boldly at the door ; it was opened by a female domes-
tic. I enquired, ?Is the Senor di Mendocini at
home ?? ? No, Senor,? was the reply. ? Then I will
await his return,? I rejoined ; ? show me into a room. 7
she did so. As I entered it, I took her by the arm
and forced her in with me. ? Now,? I said, ? where
?can I find Donna Angela?? ?She is above, Senor,
with her duenna,? was the rejoinder.? ? Which room ? ?
I demanded. ? That which faces you at the top of the
stairs,? said the girl. ?So far well; here is something
for you,? I said, placing a few pistoles in her hand.
? and now let me enjoin you to keep silence; for should
you attempt to raise any alarm, you see this,? I said,
pointing to a poignard in my girdle. I then left the
room, closing and locking the door behind me, and
ascended the stairs. As I placed my foot upon the
landing, the door in front of me was gently opened,
and Donna Angela came out alone. At so unexpect-
edly meeting me. she started and uttered a faint cry ;
but, placing my finger on my lip, I signed to her to be
quiet; she understood me. I then enquired of her,
*? where is your duenna ? ? ? She is in there,? she said,
pointing to .the room fom which she'had just come,
?and has just fallen asleep in her chair ? ? ?Tis well,
I whispered ; and now, Angela, let me speedily tell you


the object of my present visit: it is to say farewell ?
perhaps for ever.? She could only look at me with
amasement. I continued, ? I must at once leave
Spain, I have done a deed ?a deed of blood?and it
is known that by my hand Don Sebastiano d?Argano
fell; but he himself provoked the quarrel.?l slew him
in honorable fight?sword against sword ; but, Angela
I must away, for even now they are searching forme.?
She appeared to wish to speak, but was unable to do
so . ? Angela,? I resumed, I have not time for dal-
lying. Unless thou wilt link thy fortunes to mine and
fly with me, I must say adieu for ever.? She hesitated
to reply ; I urged her on, ? Come, come,? I said, ? I
must hence ; but one embrace, and then ? ? Stay?
she exclaimed, ? I will fly with you, But a few mo-
ments, and I will return.? she said, springing into an
adjoining room. As she left me, the door of the sit-
ting-room was opened, and her duenna made her
appearance. She started back in alarm at seeing me.
I followed her into the room, and drawing a pistol,
gave her to understand that silence was the wisest way
to save more unpleasant results; then seizing a bell-
rope which was close at hand, I pulled it down, and
having bound her with it to her chair, I left the room,
locking the door on the outside. Just as I had ac-
complished this feat, which I had effected with as
much expedition as I have described it, Angela met
me, bearing a small bag in which she had secured
what money and jewels she could find. We now pro-
ceeded as rapidly as possible to my own house. I
immediately ordered two of ray fleetest horses to be
saddled, and having collected all the money and
valuables that I had in the house, and prevailed on
Angela to quit her female dress for that of a cavalier,
we mounted our horses, and at full speed took the
road to Barcelona, nor did we draw rein for ten
minutes until we reached that p.�rt. My first course
?on reaching Barcelona, was to enquire about the ves-
sels sailing thence, and I found that one would sail for
Havre de Grace that very day, and after that none for


a week. No time, however, was to be lost in quitting
Spain; so I immediately secured berths on board this
vessel. I then disposed of my horses for a tolerably
large sum, and, Angela having resumed her female
attire, that night we went on board, and took leave ot
Spain for ever. Our voyage prospered until we reached
the Bay of Biscay, where we encountered a terrific
storm. The good ship, after battling with the wind
and waves for some hours, sprang a leak, The pumps
were set to work, but it was found necessary to lighten
the ship. The masts were cut away, but with little
effect; the heavy portion of the cargo was thrown over-
board, but she still leaked apace. At last, however,
by great exertions, the leak was for the time stopped;
and now the storm subsided, and for two whole days
was this mastless hulk rolling on the tumbling billow's
of Biscay. As the sun was about to set on the second
day, a Neapolitan vessel (which had observed us for
some time) bore dowm and took us on board. The
other ship was then fired and abandoned. The vessel
on board of which we now found ourselves was bound
for Copenhagen, but the captain, at our request, put
into Havre, and landed us there. On our arrival in
France we lost no time in getting lawfully married.
We then journeyed up to Paris, where I immediately
set about looking for an opportunity of investing our
little capital in an advantageous manner. I did not
wait long. Perusing the paper one morning, an adver-
tisement arrested my attention; it w r as a small farm,
with cider orchards, to be disposed of on the Cote
d?Or, at a most moderate price. lat once consulted
Angela on the subject of purchasing it; she gave her
consent, I applied for and bought it, and w r e have
lived upon it ever since. Being desirous of knowing
what had been done w'ith my property in Spain, I have
frequently written to my sister to enquire, but have
never heard from her. Whether my letters have mis-
carried, whether she shuns me as a homicide, whether
she has left Salsona, or is dead, I know not. Some
two months ago I made one more attempt to gain some


information of my friends, and of the disposition of
my properiy. I wrote to an aunt, who lived at Sara-
gossa, but have received no reply, neither shall I make
any further effort. Now, Senor, you have my whole
history,? ? And a most interesting one has it been,?
I replied; ?my friend, I am very much obliged to
you.?
Scarcely had this conversation ceased, when we
heard a horse galloping up the hill behind us. We
stood aside, to allow it to pass; but as soon as the
stranger came up to us, he suddenly reigned in his
horse and asked ? Can you tell me where a man named
Pierre Pardon lives on this mountain?? My com-
panion did not seem to heed either him or his question.
His eyes w r ere rivetted upon the horse; his lips quivered,
and he uttered the word ? Frezzi.? The noble animal
turned its head towards him. ? Oui c?est, Frezzi,? he
exclaimed. The horse again turned its head. At one
bound he crossed the road, and, throwing his arms
round the animal?s neck, he embraced it. Then dis-
engaging himself, he addressed the rider, ? Qui cher-
chez vous (whom do you seek) ?? ? Pierre Pardon,?
was the reply. ? Cest moi (it is I),? returned my
companion ; what would you with me ?? The stranger
leapt from his horse, and taking off his hat, asked in
Spanish, ? Do you know me, Don Pedro di Pardoni??
My companion gazed at him for some moments, and
then exclaimed, ?Py heavens, it is? it is Don Sebas-
tian� D?argano ! ? ?Yes,? replied the stranger, ?the
same who now comes to seek your pardon for having
driven you from your country and your friends, and
to restore you to them.? ?Put,? asked Don Pedro,
? How did you learn my whereabouts ? ? Listen,?
rejoined the other, ? and in a few words I will recount
to you all that has occurred since you left Spain. On
that luckless night upon which we fought, you left me
doubtless for dead ; but it appears that as you took to
flight, Don Emanuel di Mendocini came up and
caused me to be conveyed to his own house, before
reaching which, however, my consciousness returned.


On arriving at the house, judge of Don Emanuel?s
consternation at finding that his house had been en-
tered, his servants bound and locked up and his
daughter gone ; the old man was unable to ascertain
with whom she had fled?it broke his heart, he
lingered for a time and died without making a will,
his property will therefore revert to her if she can be
found.? ? She shall be found? interrupted Bardoni?
? ?twas with me she fled?what further news?? Your
sister left Salsona shortly after your flight, and now
resides at Madrid?your Aunt at Saragossa (whose
ward Donna Julia, I have married) died some months
ago, leaving her property to you if you could be found
within two years after her death. Acting as her
executor, your letter, which you wrote her came to my
hands, and I thereby instructed where to seek, found
you here. Your noble horse there, who knew you
before I did, take him. I know he was your favorite.
I purchased him at Barcelona.? Seizing Don Sebas-
tian� by both hands and shaking them with an earnest-
ness which plainly spoke the feeling of his heart,
Bardoni exclaimed ? Come, Sebastiano, all past must
be forgiven and forgotten on both sides. Come to my
house now and ere a week elapse we will return once
more in friendship to our native land.? By this time
the diligence had almost reached the summit of the
hill where we had been standing during the latter part
of the above dialogue, so I wished the friends ? good-
bye? and a long continuance in their renewed friend-
ship, and once more taking my seat in the ? interieur?
with far less agreeable company then I had on the
?exterieur? resumed my onward journey.
