Introduction.
To the Honourable Joseph Benedict Chifley, M.P.,
Minister of State for Post-War Reconstruction.
Sir,
We were appointed on the 19 th April, 1943, by you with the following Terms of Reference :
To inquire into and report upon—
(a) the present housing position in Australia ; and
(b) the housing requirements of Australia during the post-war period.
A preliminary examination of our Terms of Reference convinced us that our inquiry would be a
lengthy one, but, at your request, so as to enable certain planning to be undertaken and negotiations with
the States to proceed we submitted two interim reports—the first on 21st October, 1943, and the second
on 31st March, 1944.
We have now completed our investigations and have the honour to present our final report.
This report covers the full field of inquiry of the Commission, and includes subjects already
discussed in some detail in the First and Second Interim Reports. It forms a complete record of the
recommendations of the Commission. In some cases investigations, which succeeded the drafting of the
interim reports, have led to a modification of the statements made, though in no case has there been cause
to make any major change in a recommendation. Where it seemed desirable paragraphs from the First
and Second Interim Reports have been used in full in this report.
During the last six months the Commission has been assisted by a number of advisory committees
set up under the auspices of the Department of Post-War Reconstruction. These committees were
advisory only, and the recommendations of the Commission, as set out in this report, do not
necessarily agree with the opinions of the committees. We wish to express our thanks to the members
of these committees, who have so generously made their time and experience available to us.
The names of the members of the advisory committees and of the bodies with which they are connected
are included in Appendix 11.
Before dealing with detailed recommendations on specific subjects, it is useful to outline the
basis on which the Commission approached its inquiries. We consider that a dwelling of good
standard and equipment is not only the need but the right of every citizen—whether the dwelling is to be
rented or purchased, no tenant or purchaser should be exploited by excessive profit. For the
purpose of housing, the community may be divided into three main income groups; the high-income group
is capable of making its own financial arrangements, and the middle-income group is reasonably
well provided for by existing housing agencies ; this Commission is, therefore, mainly concerned with
the housing of the low-income group.
During its investigations, the Commission has had the views of 948 witnesses, most of whom
appeared personally before us. Some of the witnesses gave evidence as private individuals, but most
represented important organisations. The Commission has visited 59 towns, representative of all
the States in the Commonwealth. The names of witnesses and of towns visited are contained
in Appendix I. We desire to record our appreciation and thanks for the co-operation given by the witnesses
and for the evidence supplied both written and oral. We regret that the magnitude of our
task prevented us hearing all the witnesses in person. We did not visit the Northern Territory
due to the pressure of time and for defence reasons, but we have ascertained from Commonwealth
sources sufficient details of the housing position and needs there that we are satisfied that the
recommendations contained in this report will, with some modifications, be applicable.
The overwhelming impression obtained from our inquiries is one of widespread deficiencies in
quantity and quality of pre-war housing and the acuteness of the present shortage. We feel strongly
that action should be taken immediately to alleviate this shortage. The limited programme
inaugurated this year by the Commonwealth Government through the agencies of the States should be
increased as rapidly as is compatible with defence demands for materials. In particular, action
should be taken immediately to acquire land, prepare sites by surveys and provision of services, and
prepare plans and working drawings for post-war homes, so that building may be increased rapidly
as soon as further supplies of labour and materials are available. We are impressed with the danger of
inadequate preparations being made now, so that, when labour and materials are available, they will be
unemployed and unused while sites are found and prepared, and plans are drawn up. Throughout the
writing of this report the need for immediate action has been in mind, and the recommendations
have been drawn up largely as a basis for this action.
It will be noted that the term “ government-sponsored housing ” was used in our
Second Interim Report to apply to housing erected through government agencies. It has since been
found desirable to use two terms —“ government-financed housing ” and “ government-sponsored
housing,* * and the meanings given to these terms are set out in a glossary on page ix.

should allow for shade. The prevailing breeze should be taken into consideration.
In sub-tropical and tropical zones and in rural areas a higher allowable percentage
above the floor areas set out below has been allowed.
Accommodation. Space for living, dining and kitchen for a two-bedroom type is
300 sq. ft., and for a three-bedroom type, 340 sq. ft. ; first bedroom, 156 sq. ft. ; second
and third bedroom, 120 sq. ft. each ; an area of 150 sq. ft. to 274 sq. ft. according
to type, for passages, verandahs, etc., or for increasing the room sizes given above.
Where a portion of this allowable percentage is used for a verandah, double the space
quoted is permitted. In addition a utility room is provided.
Ceilings should be at least 9 feet high.
Interior Finish , etc. The interior finish should be simple, attractive and easily
cleaned. Wherever possible cupboards, wardrobes and linen presses should be built in.
Kitchen. Fittings should be arranged in logical sequence in regard to their
functions, so as to minimise movements by the housewife, and equipment should be
labour-saving.
Cupboards for foodstuffs should have external ventilation and refrigeration
should be provided.
Bathroom. Minimum 30 sq. ft., with bath, shower, and wash basin.
W.C. To be separate.
Laundry. Minimum 30 sq. ft. with wash troughs and boiler.
Lighting and Heating. Where electricity is available each dwelling unit should
have general illumination for rooms and verandahs, with more intense lighting at some
points for reading, sewing, etc. *
Four power outlets should be provided in the living space, and one in each
bedroom.
Use of electricity, gas or fuel for heating and cooking will depend upon the locality.
A hot water service should be provided where costs permit.
Additions. Houses for home purchase should be designed so that additions can be
made with minimum structural alterations as the family needs increase.
Allotment. Not less than 4,500 sq. ft., frontage not less than 50 feet.


Part I. Synopsis of the Plan for Housing the People.
A. PRESENT POSITION.
1. Much of the present housing in Australia, especially of the low wage earner, is of a poor
standard.
2. It is estimated that by January, 1945, the shortage of dwellings, including sub-standard houses
needing replacement, will amount to 300,000.
3. Housing surveys may reveal that the shortage is far greater than 300,000 dwelling units.
4. Existing cities and towns need wholly or partially replanning.
B. FUTURE REQUIREMENTS.
5. Normal annual post-war requirements will be about 40,000 dwelling units. This number will
increase as the population increases, and makes no allowance for immigration nor replacement of obsolete
dwellings.
6. Community facilities need to be provided in both new and built-up areas.
7. Periodic housing surveys should be undertaken to determine the total needs and the location
for the dwellings required.
C. TOTAL HOUSING REQUIRED.
8. It should be the aim within ten years after the war to overcome the housing shortage, provide
for normal annual replacements, repair or replace sub-standard dwellings and undertake slum clearance
9. It is estimated that this will require, by the end of 1955, the erection of at least 700,000 dwelling
units, including single units, attached units, multi-storey dwellings and hostels.
10. In addition, provision must be made for repairs to dwelling units, including those postponed
owing to war-time restrictions, and for construction of community facilities.
D. ANNUAL PROGRAMMES.
11. The target should be 50,000 dwelling units erected or under construction by the end of the
first post-war year, rising to 80,000 by the end of the third post-war year, and maintained at that level
until the shortage is overcome, and then tapered off to the number necessary to provide for normal
increase and the replacement of obsolete dwellings.
E. GOVERNMENT-FINANCED AND PRIVATE BUILDING.
12. The Commonwealth and State Governments, local government authorities and private
enterprise will need to work in co-operation to achieve the suggested annual programmes.
13. All dwellings erected, including rural, should be of at least the standard recommended in
this report.
14. Of the 50,000 dwelling units to be constructed in the first post-war year, 30,000 might be
government-financed and 20,000 financed by private enterprise. Of the 80,000 dwelling unit programme,
40,000 might be built by government agencies and 40,000 by private enterprise.
15. The Commonwealth Government should sponsor a government-financed housing programme
16. A Commonwealth Housing Authority should be set up with planning and advisory functions,
and State Housing Authorities should be established with full housing powers to be responsible for
detailed housing projects and for the construction and administration of government-financed housing.
17. Local government authorities should be encouraged to participate in the planning,
construction and administration of housing projects, under powers delegated by the State Housing
Authority.
18. The housing undertaken by private enterprise will be financed and constructed as before the
war by semi-government bodies, banks, insurance companies, building societies, friendly societies, other
bodies and individuals.
19. The Commonwealth Government should sponsor regular conferences with State Housing
Authorities to discuss housing policy.
F. NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND TOWN PLANNING.
20. The Commonwealth Government should undertake responsibility for national planning
and for this purpose should set up a Commonwealth Planning Authority.
21. State planning should be co-ordinated through State Planning Authorities.
22. Regional and town planning legislation should be enacted in all States.
23. Pending the drawing up of full town plans, the control of land use should be through zoning,
the declaration of housing development areas and control of subdivision of land.


G. CONTROL IS NECESSARY.
24. Whilst the present acute housing shortage continues present controls of investment, transfers
of land, prices and rents should be maintained and the issue of building permits should be continued.
25. During this period residential building should be limited to dwellings of a moderate cost
and to the standards recommended in this report.
26. This restriction should be gradually relaxed as the housing shortage is reduced.
H. LAND.
27. A government valuing authority should be established in each State and should use uniform
principles of valuation, possibly co-ordinated by a Commonwealth valuing authority.
28. A special committee should be set up to investigate land nationalisation, and as an alternative,
an incremental (betterment) tax.
29. Compensation for land resumed should be based on the valuation of the government
valuing authority.
30. State Housing Authorities should be empowered—
(a) to declare housing development areas, so as to control the subdivision and price of land
required for residential building ;
(b) to purchase or resume land required for housing purposes ;
(c) to replan and/or re-subdivide areas purchased or resumed.
31. Action should be taken immediately to secure suitable land and to prepare it for housing.
32. Sufficient technicians should be made available to undertake this work.
I. MATERIALS REQUIRED.
33. Timber will be in short supply. Stocks of seasoned timber should be built up. Supplies of
bricks will depend upon the labour available to produce them. There may be shortages of other materials
and equipment.
34. New uses of material and new types of construction should be investigated by the
Experimental Building Station.
J. LABOUR.
35. It is estimated that, before the war, between 50,000 and 70,000 men were employed in
domestic construction. Residential building in that period amounted to about 40,000 dwellings a year.
If the goal of 80,000 dwellings a year is to be reached a substantial increase in labour will be required for
domestic building. This increase will not, however, be proportionate to the number previously employed.
36. Training of additional technicians and building tradesmen should be commenced immediately.
K. CONSTRUCTION.
37. State Housing Authorities will probably concentrate on mass construction ; this may be
undertaken by contract or day labour or a combination of both.
38. Semi-government bodies, private organisations and persons will build largely on single
allotments, generally by individual contracts.
L. ORGANISATION OF THE BUILDING INDUSTRY.
39. The organisation of the domestic building industry should be improved so as to expedite
construction and reduce costs.
M. FINANCE.
40. The Commonwealth Government should make loans to State Housing Authorities for
approved housing projects.
41. Sales tax on building materials should be removed.
42. Where subsidies are required to bring the payment for housing to the agreed proportion
of the family income, the cost should be borne by the Commonwealth and State Governments in agreed
proportions.
43. Where subsidies are required for the establishment of certain community facilities in new
or built-up areas, the cost should be shared by the Commonwealth and State Governments and local
government authorities concerned in agreed proportions.
44. Private building will be financed by semi-government bodies, banks, insurance companies,
building societies and private]persons.


N. ADMINISTRATION.
(a) Proportion of Government-Financed Housing for Renting and for Sale.
45. During the early post-war period the great bulk of government-financed housing should be
for renting ; since high building costs are likely to continue for a time after the war and as there are
certain to be large shifts of population in the immediate post-war period, it is undesirable to encourage
home purchase while these conditions prevail.
46. During this period permits for the construction of a limited number of dwellings for purchase
should be allocated to the areas of the greatest housing shortage, and then allotted to individual applicants
according to an agreed order of priority.
47 After the immediate post-war period provision for home purchase through government-
financed building should be increased to a proportion based on the experience of the needs of the people.
( b) Weekly Rent.
48. The weekly rent of a government-financed dwelling unit of the standard recommended in
this report should be the economic rent or one-sixth of the family income, whichever is the less.
49. Where the economic rent is more than one-sixth of the family income the difference should
be covered by a subsidy provided by the Commonwealth and State Governments.
50. This subsidy should be granted in the form of a rental rebate based on the amount of the
family income and the number of dependants.
(c) Purchase Instalments.
51. The standard weekly payment for purchase of a government-financed dwelling of the standard
recommended in this report should not exceed 22\ per cent, of the weekly basic wage.*
52. While building costs are high, so that the economic payment for a government-financed
dwelling of the standard recommended in this report exceeds this amount the Commonwealth and State
Governments should provide a subsidy to those purchasing homes through government housing
authorities.*
53. The re-sale of a subsidised dwelling should be permitted only to the State Housing Authority
except in special circumstances.
(d) Allocation of Dwellings.
54. Priority in allocation of government-financed dwellings should be given to those groups
whose need is greatest, in accordance with a scale of priority agreed between the Commonwealth and
State Governments, but a percentage of the total dwellings available should be allotted to discharged
defence personnel.
55. Domestic building should be extended as labour and materials are available, and should take
place in accordance with a plan of development so as not to repeat the evils of the unplanned and unco-
ordinated growth of our towns in the past.
56. The report which follows deals fully with the items listed above.

A. DWELLING TYPES.
57. Most of the first houses in Australia were of wood, roofed with sheets of bark. Timber
was plentiful, while no other material could readily be obtained ; further, most of the colonists had no
time to spare for any refinements of building and wooden houses served their purpose best, being quick
and easy to erect.
58. For many years, the slab hut was the first attempt of the settler to provide shelter. Indeed,
wood has proved so convenient, cheap and useful a material that in most areas its use has remained more
common than any other material.
59. As the colonies grew, refinements in construction were made. Bark roofs were replaced
by shingles, timber was sawn, and weatherboards took the place of slabs, and floorboards of clay. In
time, galvanised iron, which was cheap and easy to handle, was used for roofing instead of shingles and
sometimes, for walls.
60. As the larger towns, such as Sydney and Hobart developed, the demand for more durable
materials grew. The manufacture of bricks began in the early days of both these towns and freestone,
which was available in unlimited quantities, became popular. The first bricks were not generally of good
quality, and the widespread use of brick is only a comparatively recent development. Tiles began to
appear in the ’eighties, and the now familiar tile-roofed brick dwelling became common in the larger
towns during this century.
61. Australian domestic architecture has at no time departed appreciably from British, and,
from the beginning of this century, there has been a marked American influence. Dwellings have shown
little adaptation to the climatic conditions ; the most distinctive developments have been the bungalow
type with verandahs all round, and a marked preference for single-storey dwellings rather than two
storeys or more.
62. The types of dwellings in Australia in 1933, classified by the materials of their outer walls, are
set out in the following table :

B. FINANCE FOR HOUSING.
(a) Early Period .
63. The main source of finance for housing in the early period of colonisation was from trading
banks, or as an investment for other organisations or individuals. Generally, the interest rates and
initial deposits demanded prohibited low income-earners from purchasing a home. House and tenement
buildin?, for rental by the low-income earner, was a profitable field of investment during last century.
Many of our worst slum areas are the inheritance of this type of speculation. The standard of housing
was kept low by the excessive profits expected. Housing was regarded as a more speculative investment
than, for example, sound shares or bonds, and so a high yield was expected. This yield has been often
greatly increased by the continued use of the dwellings after the period of amortisation of capital had
been completed.
(b) Building Societies.
64. By 1860, building societies had appeared in all States, particularly in Victoria, where the
gold rushes caused a mushroom growth of towns and a general land boom. The early building societies
were of two types : the first type was the terminating society, the rules of which were adapted from
English practice ; this type of society terminates at a fixed date or at a date specified in its rules. It
makes advances to members as they apply for them. A particular off-shoot of the terminating society
is the Starr-Bowkett Society ; this type receives subscriptions from members and makes loans free of
interest to members ; the allocation of these loans is determined by ballot or by auction to the highest
bidder.
65. The second type was the permanent building society, which is of indefinite duration, and is
in fact, purely an investment organisation. It received deposits on which it normally pays interest slightly
above the ruling trading bank rate for fixed deposits. It issues shares and makes advances for building
in the same way as any other investment organisation. Investors may be either member shareholders
or merely depositors.
66. Up to 1890 the building society movement progressed rapidly, except in Western Australia,
where only three societies were formed before that date. Many permanent societies were formed in
other States where this type of society became popular, particularly after 1870 ; permanent societies
have predominated in Victoria, Western Australia and Tasmania. In the other States, they were out-
numbered by terminating societies after 1890. By that year the building society movement had reached
its peak, due to an era of unprecedented prosperity accompanied by speculation in real estate.
67. The rapid growth of building societies up to 1890 coincided with a period of economic
expansion and prosperity. At the same time a number of land and building companies had sprung up to
exploit the land boom ; in New South Wales, these companies were registered under the Companies
Act of 1874, not being eligible for registration under the Building Societies Act of 1847. Because of the
similarity of name there was confusion of identity, leading to lack of public confidence in building societies
as well as in land and building companies. Permanent societies suffered most heavily from popular
confusion with the land companies and from the economic depression, and thereafter evidenced a gradual
decline.
68. Building societies have not-been so active or so numerous since the crisis of the 1 890’s in
any of the States except in New South Wales, where between 1893 and 1925 the Starr-Bowkett Society
enjoyed great popularity, and since 1936 a particular type of terminating society has been sponsored by
the government. In no other State has government assistance been granted to building societies to the
same extent as in New South Wales. After 1923 building societies in New South Wales had to be
registered. In 1936, the New South Wales Government guaranteed loans made by financial institutions
to co-operative building societies approved by the Co-operative Building Advisory Committee. These
societies differ from earlier terminating societies in that they are not entirely dependent on funds
subscribed by members or shareholders, but borrow from banks or insurance companies and lend the
money so obtained to members. Members of a co-operative building society pay subscriptions to the
society, and these payments are treated by the society as equity in the home for the purpose of the
society’s loan. The societies thus gain greater usefulness and the need to ballot for allotment of an
advance as in the old Starr-Bowkett Society is removed.
69. A special type of co-operative society has recently developed in New South Wales, namely
the Community Advancement Society. Under the Co-operation Act, 1923, these societies could be
formed to provide any community service or benefit, inter alia , to erect dwellings. Only since 1940 has
advantage been taken of this provision for home building purposes. Building restrictions have limited
their activities. Their most distinctive feature is that members by assuming joint responsibility are
enabled to obtain homes without deposit, and after payment of rent for periods of up to fve years,
members automatically obtain an equity in the home.
(c) Friendly Societies.
70. Friendly societies commenced to function in Australia about the same period as the building
societies ; they are associations primarily for securing social benefits to their members such as reduced
charges for medical expenses, sick pay and funeral allowances. Most of their accumulated funds have been
invested in advances to purchase homes, either existing or to be erected. No records are available,
however, of the amount invested in this way.
(d) Government Housing.
71. Early in this century, governments began to recognise the need for better provision for
housing the low-income group, and in the various States a gradual recognition of the responsibility of
governments was manifested in the legislation enacted to establish State or semi-State authorities with


power to made advances to assist persons of limited means purchase or erect houses for personal
occupation ; at a later period some States made provision for the erection of homes for purchase by
low income persons ; and, in recent years, a further extension has been made in some of the States by
extending the powers of State or semi-State authorities to erect houses for letting, and, in some cases,
assistance has been given to persons with low incomes to pay the economic rent.
72. Details of the powers of State Government and semi-government housing authorities are
set out in Appendices IV and V. Appendix 111 comprises a summary of housing legislation.
(1) Government Housing Authorities.
73. Until 1909 no State Government made any attempt to set up a body to assist people with
low incomes to obtain their homes ; in that year in Queensland the Workers’ Dwelling Board,
administering the Workers’ Dwellings Act, 1909, was the first body of this kind. This was followed
by the other States—South Australia, 1910 ; Western Australia, 1912 (January) ; New South Wales,
1912 (November) ; Victoria, 1914 ; and Tasmania, 1919. In Victoria, the provisions of the Workers’
Dwellings Act passed in 1914, empowering local government authorities to house persons on low incomes
was not availed of by local government authorities, and it was not until 1921 that the low income group
was provided for by the inauguration of the Housing Advances Section (Division 4, Part III) of the State
Savings Bank.
74. The above legislation and action under it were inadequate to solve the problem.
75. Although the 1914-18 War aggravated the housing shortage, and the return of servicemen
increased the demand still further, apart from action taken by some States to liberalise their housing
schemes, little more was done to make further provision for home building other than by the Common-
wealth War Service Homes Commission, which met, to some extent, the needs of ex-servicemen. This
Commission was established under the War Service Homes Act, 1918, with power to make advances to
ex-servicemen for home purchase at less than the current interest rate for mortgages.
76. The depression of the 1930’s caused a very great reduction in all building, and the housing
shortage became so acute during the decade 1930-40 that governments were compelled to take further
action. In these years, all States were active in improving existing and enacting new legislation. In
1936 a Housing Improvement Board was set up in New South Wales, and a Housing Trust in South
Australia, whose powers were extended by the Housing Improvement Act of 1940. A Housing Commission
was appointed in 1938 in Victoria, and in 1942 the New South Wales Housing Commission took over
the administration of all existing government housing agencies in that State. In 1943 the Victorian
Housing Commission was given wider powers, including power to erect and sell houses, and make advances
to assist for home purchase.
77. All the government housing bodies enumerated are permanent in character, and their
operations are not limited to any particular area within the State ; their powers have been in the main
limited to making advances to assist home ownership and building for rental or sale to people of incomes
not exceeding certain amounts varying in each State (see Appendices IV and V). The Victorian Housing
Commission, the South Australian Housing Trust and the New South Wales Housing Commission have
power to undertake slum clearance in conjunction with new housing, but, apart from clearing out a few
slum pockets in Victoria and demolitions concurrent with the erection of flats by the Sydney City Council
during the period 1914 to 1927 very little slum clearance has been undertaken.
78. Legislation, which government housing bodies administered, was expressly intended to
afford opportunities to people of limited means to rent or purchase a home on easier terms than those
offered by private enterprise.
79. Certain similarities are evident between housing measures of all States, in that a limit is
usually placed on the income of the applicant and the amount of advance on the capital cost of the house ;
also the applicant must personally occupy the house and must not own another house. In cases of home
purchase the deposit required varies in each State. This may be seen from Appendix V.
80. Building for renting has not been extensive, the policy having been for home purchase.
The South Australian Housing Trust and the Victorian Housing Commission have to date erected homes
for renting and the latter authority allows rental rebates in cases of hardship.
(2) Semi-Government Financial Institutions.
81. Five banks have administered Government funds for both building and lending for home
purchase. In Tasmania, the Agricultural Bank, which began housing operations in 1919, is the only State
instrumentality. In New South Wales the State Savings Bank operated a home-purchase scheme from
1912 to 1932, when its Advances for Homes Department was merged into the Rural Bank, which continued
the operations until 1942 ; the Rural Bank still continues to lend for home building, but the New South
Wales Housing Commission has taken over the administration of government housing. In Victoria, the
State Savings Bank has been lending since 1911, and building since 1921. The State Bank of South
Australia has also been lending since 1910, and building since 1916 ; the Savings Bank of South Australia
has lent for home purchase for many years and has power to purchase land and build homes under the
Savings Bank of South Australia Act, 1929-42.
82. The Governments in the States of Tasmania, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia
conferred powers on these banks to offer loans on liberal terms, and to build low cost houses, in lieu
of the establishment of special bodies for that purpose. The arrangement still prevails in Tasmania,
but in the three other States special bodies described above were eventually created for that purpose,
and to provide houses for renting* —South Australia in 1936, Victoria in 1938 and New South Wales in
1942.


(3) Housing for government employees
83. A number of government departments have found it necessary to provide housing for certain
of their employees. Notable examples are Departments of Railways, which have had to provide housing
for maintenance staff in sparsely settled areas and Departments of Education for teachers in some areas.
In many parts, the standard of this housing has been unsatisfactory. One of the problems of housing
this particular section of the community is that there is the difficulty of adjustment to meet the sizes of
families stationed in a particular area from time to time.
84. A few government institutions have financed and built housing in particular areas. The
Commonwealth Department of the Interior has been responsible for the erection of the majority of
houses in Canberra. These houses can be either rented or purchased on liberal terms. All land is
leasehold and the capital cost of the land is not included in the purchase price. The Victorian State
Electricity Commission affords a notable example of extensive provision for employees in its building
of the model town of Yallourn.
(e) Commonwealth Bank.
85. The Commonwealth Bank has made funds available for housing in four ways : By overdraft
to individuals from the trading bank department, by advances to individuals from the savings bank
department, by advances to co-operative building societies, and by advances to housing authorities in
terms of the Commonwealth Housing Act, 1927-28.
86. Loans to individuals through both the trading bank and the savings bank departments have
been made for the erection and purchase of homes or to repay existing mortgages. Advances for new
dwellings have generally been for houses varying from £6OO to £1,500 in cost. Maximum advance is
60 per cent, of the Bank’s valuation for brick or similar construction, and 50 per cent, for any other type.
87. Debenture loans for housing purposes were made to the Rural Bank of New South Wales in
1935 and 1936, and to the State Advances Corporation of Queensland in 1937 and 1942 ; these loans
were not subject to the terms of the Commonwealth Housing Act, 1927-28.
( f ) Trading Banks and Life Insurance Companies.
88. The nine trading banks which operate in Australia all make advances for housing, generally
by way of overdraft. Practice varies with each bank, and even with respect to individual borrowers.
Cases are usually considered on individual merits with regard to the financial position of the borrower,
his ability to repay and the value and type of the dwelling. The banks invariably carefully investigate the
borrower’s personal worth and the security offered, and, generally, require regular and steady reduction
of the overdraft. Advances are not as a rule much higher than 60 per cent, of the bank’s valuation of
land and dwelling, though additional amounts may be advanced where collateral security is given, thus
trading banks do not generally cater for people on low incomes. No information is available of the total
amount of housing financed in this way, as most banks have not kept, in the past, separate records of
these transactions.
89. Life insurance companies are somewhat more liberal in the terms they offer. Advances
are made on table mortgages for periods up to thirty years and up to 75 per cent, of the security ; some
companies have decided to advance up to 90 per cent, when present war-time restrictions on home
building are relaxed.
90. Both trading banks and insurance companies have financed the purchase of a large number of
existing and new homes and the erection of new homes for those able to provide satisfactory security.
(g) Building Companies.
91. There is a large number of private building or investment companies which make finance
available for home building, generally at comparatively high interest rates. In some cases construction
of dwellings is undertaken. No information is available of the total operations of companies of this kind.
In addition a number of builders themselves erect houses and arrange advances for home purchase or
sell them on terms.
( h ) Private Firms.
92. Some private firms build and sell houses to their employees. This policy has been adopted,
particularly in isolated towns where housing conditions are not attractive for investment for home
building or accommodation is very difficult to obtain. Objection to this method of housing has been
raised on the ground that an employee does not desire his employer to be also his landlord. The
association of the residence with the occupation creates difficulties, particularly in a period of
unemployment.
C. GENERAL CONCLUSIONS.
93. This brief outline of the beginning of home building, and of methods of financing the erection
of dwellings for the low income group enables certain conclusions to be drawn.
94. The absence of satisfactory legal enactments during the early development of our large towns,
either regarding the subdivision and sale of land or the construction and standard of dwellings, allowed
speculators to exploit the people’s urgent need for housing.
95. The continued rapid growth of most towns, particularly the capital cities, with the general
neglect of any ordered plans governing their growth as entities, or regard for correctly placing industries
in relation to where the people who worked in them would have to live, has accentuated the evils of bad
housing. This state of affairs has allowed the unscrupulous builder and the investor, greedy for profit,


to exploit a large number of the people, who have been helpless to do anything but compete for the
insufficient supply of housing in positions where it was necessary for them to live. The inevitable results
have been high rents for bad housing, overcrowding, and the continued use of housing which should be
demolished.
96. During more recent times, private enterprise has failed to provide new good standard housing
for the low income group of the people, because it has not been profitable to do so at a rent these people
could afford to pay. v v
97. The erection of dwellings in Australia for renting or for sale, except the small percentage
built and financed through government agencies, has been governed by the desire to make profits ; this
same desire has also governed the financing of them.
98. The Commission considers that the housing of the people of the Commonwealth adequately,
soundly, hygienically, and effectively, each according to his social and economic life is a national need, and,
accordingly, should cease to be a field of investment yielding high profits.
99. The investigations of the Commission have revealed large areas of deplorable housing, where
overcrowding and lack of reasonable provision for ventilation and/or sanitation must be injurious to the
health of the occupants and encourage crime and delinquence. These conditions are present not only
in the slum areas of large cities and towns, but also to an extent in small towns and on rural properties.
100. The collective and accumulative effects of these conditions on many thousands of our people
through several generations cannot be calculated.
101. It is an attempt to escape from this background and to bring the number and standard of
houses into line with the need for them, that has led to the development of government-financed housing.
102. The depression of the early 1 930’s and the increasing age of the houses erected during the
early period of settlement in various parts of Australia have rendered the position more and more acute.
The cessation of building in the depression years accentuated the housing shortage, and the increasing
age of many of our dwellings makes it clear that some action from the community as a whole is necessary
to ensure that there is modern good standard housing for all the people—housing which is suitable for
life in the present era and not to that of 60 to 100 years ago.
103. The additional problems arising from the present war, and estimates of the extent of the
present housing shortage are discussed in Part 111.

SUMMARY: A. General considerations.
B. Statistical estimates of shortage.
C. Housing surveys.
(a) Need for surveys.
(b) Information required from Australian, surveys.
(e) Survey methods.
(1) Housing census.
(2) Sample surveys.
(3) Estimates from local government and housing authorities.
(d) Recommended surveys.
D. Alterations and repairs necessary.
E. Immigration.
F. Summary of housing needs.
A. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.
104. The pre-war housing shortage in Australia has been rendered more acute by the practical
cessation of all civil building during the war. The demand for housing is now being increased by the
discharge of defence personnel, and it will be still further increased by general demobilisation. It is
possible that a number of persons now living in cities may return to their old home areas, but the effect
of this on housing conditions will be more than offset by the return of defence personnel, and by the
demand for separate dwellings due to war-time and post-war marriages. At the same time the need
for replacement of sub-standard dwellings has increased during the war years as more and more dwellings
have become unfit for human habitation. The accumulated demand for repairs and alterations to dwellings
is great. The difficulties of the present position are well known though their extent cannot be accurately
stated. Attempts to calculate the extent of the housing shortage have been made by statistical methods
and by certain partial surveys. The available information is still meagre, but for the purpose of general
planning to meet the housing position, it is sufficient to know that there is in Australia at present an
extensive housing shortage and a large amount of sub-standard housing. On this basis, the preliminary
work of this Commission proceeded.
105. It should be stressed that the inadequacies of statistical information need in no way retard
the immediate housing programme, as the shortage, particularly in some areas, is so acute that it is
inconceivable that overbuilding could take place.
B. STATISTICAL ESTIMATES OF SHORTAGE.
106. Statistical information on housing is most inadequate. Even the amount of pre-war
residential building has to be estimated to some extent. Different States have kept their records in
various ways, and over large areas building has not been recorded. When it is recorded, the word
“ dwelling ” may refer to a separate living unit, as defined for the purpose of the census, or it may refer
to a residential building such as a block of flats containing a number of living units. We would urge the
desirability of ensuring, as far as possible, that all States compile housing statistics for their whole area
and in a uniform manner, so that a reasonable picture can be obtained for the whole of Australia. Lacking
reliable figures of even pre-war building it has been impossible to calculate at all accurately the amount
of building required after the war. The statistical estimates, which have been made, suggest that by
January, 1945, there will be a shortage of at least 300,000 dwellings (inclusive of replacement of sub-
standard dwellings).
C. HOUSING SURVEYS.
(a) Need for Surveys.
107. The fact that it is possible to make preliminary plans for post-war building on the basis of
crude estimates, must not obscure the need for full housing surveys. There can be no adequate planning
for the repair and demolition of existing dwellings, the location and types of new dwellings, or the location
of community facilities without detailed information gained through a complete survey. To neglect the
inauguration of a full housing survey must lead to the perpetuation of the inadequate planning of the
past, which has contributed so much to t-he disabilities of life in our present towns.
108. Itjs significant to note that in New Zealand (“ General Report on State Housing in New
Zealand, 1943 ” —Department of Housing Construction, page 10) : “ One of the first duties undertaken
by the new [Housing] Department was the putting into operation of the Housing Survey Act, 1935, and
the Housing Survey Regulations, 1936. These regulations imposed an obligation upon the Council of
every borough and the Board of every town district having a population of not less than one thousand
inhabitants to prepare a housing survey. The Housing Survey Regulations required local authorities


to submit to the Minister of Finance, who was at that time in charge of housing, a statement, together
with a map showing the houses which are below the standard set out in the Second and Third Schedules
of the regulations, and also the houses which are overcrowded. The housing survey was designed to
provide information as to residential structures and dwelling units, the type and construction of dwellings,
their condition, the presence or absence of proper sanitary and domestic conveniences, the number of
persons occupying these dwellings, and the bedroom occupation in relation to the number of occupants.”
109. In the United States of America a comprehensive survey of urban housing accompanied
the entry of the Federal Government into the housing field. In 1934, a survey was conducted by the
Department of Commerce as a part of the Civil Works Administration programme. Surveys continued
through 1934 to 1936, and covered over two-fifths of the urban families in the United States of America.
More than eight million units were surveyed by field workers. The proportion of urban homes included
in the surveys varies from region to region, but does not fall below 20 per cent, for any one of the four
major regions into which the cities were grouped for the purpose of summarising data.
(b) Information Required from Australian Surveys.
110. The information most urgently required in Australia for an immediate building programme
is :
(1) the numerical shortage of dwelling units and community facilities, showing the distribution
of the shortage between different areas ; and
(2) the number of existing dwellings which are below the recommended standard of habitation,
subdivided to show those which are capable of being brought up to this standard and those
which require demolition.
111. Further data, which would be of assistance, cannot be adequately shown by a survey but
must to a large extent be estimated. This applies to information such as present and probable post-war
population movements, and probable demand for dwellings and hostels by pensioners, single persons,
including students and adolescents, on medium and low incomes for whom there has not been adequate
provision in the past.
112. After the formulation of a general housing programme based on information of the type
listed above, project surveys should be taken, which will give detailed information about particular areas,
where housing projects are contemplated. These may be classed as preliminary regional and/or town
planning surveys rather than housing surveys. They should include data about incomes of probable
occupants of the housing, and the place and nature of their work, and, in addition, information about
transport, public utilities, land utilisation, zoning and community facilities available.
113. Some housing and social surveys have already been taken in parts of Australia. They have,
however, concerned special areas only, and the results are not always comparable, partly because of
differences in methods and partly because of the different times and conditions under which the surveys
were taken.
114. The main surveys taken in New South Wales have been those undertaken by the Housing
Conditions Investigation Committee, 1936, and the New South Wales Housing Improvement Board which
was appointed in 1936. These cover sections of the metropolitan area only. Additional surveys of
specific areas have been undertaken by University research workers, the Housing Council of New South
Wales and the Commonwealth War Housing Trust.
115. In Victoria, the main metropolitan surveys have been by the Housing Investigation and
Slum Abolition Board, 1937, and by the University of Melbourne in a social survey completed in 1943.
A sociological survey of a number of rural townships has been undertaken by the School of Agriculture
of the University of Melbourne.
116. In Queensland, a sample Family Budget Survey, 1939-40, by the Bureau of Industry, covers
expenditure on housing and a further sample survey of 277 buildings (I in 1,000) taken in 1943 covers
overdue repairs. The Department of War Organisation of Industry has also undertaken overcrowding
surveys of Toowoomba, Ipswich and Maryborough.
117. In South Australia, partial surveys have been made of the metropolitan area by the Building
Act Enquiry Committee, 1940, and by the University of Adelaide, which has recently conducted a sample
postal social survey in Adelaide, and a special survey of one in two dwellings in Port Augusta.
I 18. A rough survey of housing requirements in Western Australia was made by the Western
Australian Advisory Committee on Housing, 1943, while in Tasmania, University research workers have
undertaken postal surveys of Hobart, Launceston and some country towns, and the Hobart City Council
in 1943 surveyed some sub-standard areas.
119. The only housing information in respect of Australia, as a whole, is to be found in the
Commonwealth decennial census returns. The information given in these returns, is, however,
dependent on the judgments of average individuals and little information on quality of the housing is
given. Anomalies arise, such as the inclusion of shacks, ” bag humpies ” and abandoned structures in
the total of habitable dwellings.
120. The information referred to above gives a useful preliminary picture of the problems and
will be useful for comparison later, but it in no way removes the need for a full Australian housing survey
to be undertaken as soon as possible.


(c) Survey Methods.
121. In addition to general statistics based on the size and conjugal condition of the population,
there are three main methods by which it is possible to estimate housing needs :
(1) housing census;
(2) sample surveys ; and
(3) estimates from local government authorities.
The reliability of any of these methods varies with the type of information required, the method of
investigation and the training of the persons undertaking the survey.
(1) Housing Census.
122. The most complete method is the housing census, which is a complete house-to-house survey
of the whole of the country, or a large section of it. For this purpose it would be necessary to train a
large staff in the required technique, so as to make results comparable throughout the Commonwealth.
If the questions asked were comparatively simple factual ones, the training required might be limited.
The housing census might be undertaken in conjunction with a full census.
123. The total number of dwelling units in Australia is somewhere in the vicinity of 1.8 million.
It has been estimated that a full housing census would require a large number of persons divided about
equally between office and field workers. If, however, the work were combined with a full census, a
lesser additional number would be required.
124. The advantages of a housing census are the completeness and reliability of the information
collected.
125. A full housing census now could not be justified since estimates of overcrowding in particular
areas would be unlikely to apply to post-war conditions. Therefore, we consider that a full housing
census should be approved but that it should not be taken until after the war, preferably to be commenced
about one year after, when the location of the population may be assumed to have some permanency.
A suggested housing survey form is included in Appendix XVIII.
(2) Sample Surveys.
126. The accuracy of the results of sample surveys depends largely on the size and method of
selecting the sample and the methods of collecting information concerning the selected sample.
127. Housing surveys may be taken by post or by house-to-house visits. A postal survey involves
fairly obvious difficulties. Not all the persons to whom the survey forms are sent reply, and those who
do reply tend to form a biassed sample, being composed partly of the clerically minded, and partly of
those with some grievance they hope to have rectified. Again, as the information is given by the
householder only, it involves considerable personal bias, even when this is not intentional. It is difficult
for the householder to have any knowledge of the standard which the surveying authority regards as
adequate.
128. A house-to-house sample survey requires considerable staff, and all staff should receive an
elementary training in the work. The full survey should be in charge of a statistician with a knowledge
of the principles of sampling and the probable bias in the results obtained if the questions and the verbal
approach are not very carefully supervised.
129. A sample survey can give some general idea of the quality of houses in an area, and the
standard of occupancy, but cannot give the detailed information of a housing census. We consider that
sample housing surveys should be taken in areas with which the immediate post-war housing programme
is particularly concerned, and that, in the case of a few country towns, a fairly full house-to-house survey
might be taken in order to avoid any danger of over-building.
(3) Estimates from Local Government and Housing Authorities.
130. A rough estimate of the approximate size of the housing problem can be obtained from
local government authorities. Local government authorities are responsible for supervising the condition
of the housing in their areas and in general may be expected to be able to give a fairly reliable estimate
of the amount of over-crowding, and the amount of sub-standard housing. The manpower involved
in taking this type of survey is small. The main danger is that such authorities may be biassed. Some
may wish to make sure that building will take place in their area by painting a particularly bad picture of
the housing ; with others it is a matter of pride to deny the existence of any sub-standard housing.
131. This method of survey was suggested to a conference of State officials called by the Ministry
of Post-War Reconstruction in October, 1943, to discuss the carrying out of a preliminary housing survey
as soon as possible. After discussion, each State agreed to take a survey, the technique to be used being
left to each State to select. In some States, it was considered that the State Housing Authority could
secure the necessary information without using local government authorities. The results of this
preliminary housing survey are not yet available.
(d) Recommended Surveys.
132. Summarising the discussion of surveys given above, WE RECOMMEND that surveys of
housing be made as follows :
(1) The first preliminary estimate made through State authorities (see paragraph 131) should
be followed by sample surveys in areas where this seems desirable ; and
(2) A full housing census should be commenced about one year after the end of the war,
preferably in conjunction with a general census.


D. ALTERATIONS AND REPAIRS NECESSARY.
133. In so far as alterations are necessary to bring dwellings up to an approved standard of
habitation, rough estimates of the amount of work required will be given by housing surveys.
134. In addition to any alterations required, there will be the normal rate of repairs delayed
during the war. There will be a strong demand for labour and materials for this purpose during the
immediate post-war period. An estimate of the repairs to all buildings required in Queensland has been
made by the Bureau of Industry on a one in one thousand sample survey ; this estimate amounts to
£10.5 m., involving 30,000 man-years. In our opinion, this figure appears high (in any case a substantial
amount could be safely deferred), but any figure assumed at this stage must be tentative.
135. The value of pre-war maintenance of dwellings in Australia has been estimated at about
£lO m. to £l2 m. per annum. Approximately one-quarter to one-third of normal repairs have been
carried out since the beginning of 1941. The delayed demand for repairs, however, will be less than
the total amount not carried out during the war years. Probably about £25 m. to £35 m. of delayed repairs
will need to be carried out in the early post-war period according to the urgency of need. This estimate
is crude and will need to be varied in the light of actual experience in the immediate post-war years, but
it is a sufficient basis for preliminary estimates on which to base a general housing programme.
E. IMMIGRATION.
136. The estimates of housing demand in the post-war years, which have been included in the
earlier sections of this Part, all presuppose the maintenance of the present population of Australia at
approximately its present level, with some slight allowance for natural increase. Should any large scale
immigration take place after the war, these estimates will need to be correspondingly increased.
137. It is impossible for this Commission to hazard an opinion about the probable size of
immigration after the war. Not only has the immigration policy of the Commonwealth Government
not been announced but the amount of immigration will depend also on the policy of the countries from
which immigrants may come. It is, however, clear that if there is an appreciable number of immigrants
after the war, consideration must be given to the provision of housing for them. It may be roughly
assumed that, if family immigration is the policy, one dwelling will be required for each four immigrants.
If child immigration is extensive some hostel accommodation may be required.
138. Consideration might be given to the re-use of military buildings and temporary houses
erected for war workers, to provide temporary accommodation for immigrants on arrival in this country.
This accommodation must, however, be definitely temporary, as it would be undesirable to afford
immigrants permanently a lower housing standard than Australians. It would, moreover, tend to
depress the housing standard generally.
F. SUMMARY OF HOUSING NEEDS.
139. In summary, we may assume, until the results of the preliminary housing survey
are available, that the housing shortage will amount to 300,000 dwelling-units by January, 1945 ; this is
probably an underestimate. In addition, preparation must be made for a programme of delayed repairs,
amounting to £25 m. to £35 m. in the early post-war period, for alterations necessary to bring the worst
sub-standard houses up to the recommended standard of habitation and for a normal annual building
programme of about 40,000 dwelling-units a year. Dwellings required for immigrants must be added
to this total and a further addition may need to be made for building in the Northern Territory, New
Guinea and mandated territories.
140. Any residential building undertaken before January, 1945, will, of course, reduce these
estimates, but it is unlikely to make any appreciable difference to the total picture.


Part IV. Need for the Commonwealth Government to
participate in Housing.
SUMMARY : A. Need for continuance of certain wartime controls.
(a) General considerations.
( b ) Control of land transfers.
(c) Control of investment , prices and production of building materials.
(d) Control of rents.
(e) Issue of permits for building.
(f) Manpower.
8. Need for government action to supplement private enterprise.
C. Need for the Commonwealth Government to supplement action by State Governments.
A NEED FOR CONTINUANCE OF CERTAIN WARTIME CONTROLS.
(a) General Considerations.
141. The post-war building programme will be limited by the building resources available. The
accumulated demand for housing will be far greater than can be satisfied within a few years after the end
of the war. Also, there will be other calls on resources for social and industrial building. Factories
will need remodelling and extending and there will be additional demand for other commercial buildings.
142. Because of the shortage of building resources in relation to demand, we consider that the
oolicy towards post-war residential building should be to erect with the limited resources available, the
largest possible number of dwelling units of the standard recommended by the Commission. (See
paragraphs 621, 622.)
143. This can only be brought about by the continuance of some of the wartime controls as at
present provided under National Security Regulations, possibly in a modified form. Therefore, WE
RECOMMEND the continuance, for a period after the war, of government control of land prices and
transfers, investment, prices and production of building materials, rents and the issue of permits for
building.
(b) Control of Land Transfers.
144. The need for control of land prices and transfers is dealt with in detail in Part VI. The
accumulated demand for residential building must tend to force up the price of suitable building land
unless some control is exercised ; a speculative price rise of this kind would mean that the present owners
of land would be making profits due mainly to conditions consequent on the war, and resulting in an
undue burden to future occupants of the houses to be erected on such land.
(c) Control of Investment, Prices and Production of Building Materials.
145. At present, control of investment extends beyond control of land sales to such measures
as control of capital issues and the policy governing bank advances. Continuance of these controls for
a period after the war will assist in directing productive forces into the manufacture of certain building
materials.
146. If control of prices of building materials be not retained, the very large post-war demand
would tend to force prices up. A system of permits for new buildings would not be sufficient to check
this, since many people will desire building materials for small repairs, alterations and additions to existing
buildings for which permits are not now required.
147. Maintenance of the present price control should help to prevent undue inflation of prices.
If prices tend to rise we consider that State Governments should undertake the production of key building
materials ; the object of this should be not to replace private enterprise, but to establish a sound basis
for price control and, also, to introduce an element of competition to assist to counteract any attempted
control of building materials by a combine or monopoly.
148. It may be desirable also to extend the present system of licensing the production of building
materials ; this would be designed to expand production, not restrict it. The detailed information on
production thus made available should facilitate planning of the building programme, and would provide
a basis for stepping up production in general, or in specific areas.
(d) Control of Rents.
149. The housing shortage after the war will be even more acute than at present, owing to the
demobilisation of service personnel and the increasing desire of a large number of people at present
inadequately housed to obtain better conditions. If rent control were relaxed rents would certainly soar.


150. vVe have not considered the present system of control in detail, but would suggest that those
responsible for its administration in each State should confer with the object of eliminating difficulties
We consider that detailed policy regarding rent control should be the responsibility of the Common-
wealth and State Housing Authorities. Consideration should be given to the system of administration
a ren .n?!! o V * South Australian Housing Trust under the Landlord and Tenant (Control of Rents)
Act, 1942 (South Australia). v ’
(e) Issue of Permits for Building.
151. Building of all classes has been checked by the war, except as necessary for defence and for
minor repairs. In the post-war period while the demand for building resources is greater than the supply,
it will be necessary to allocate the limited resources between building of different classes, such as hospitals,
schools, factories, and houses ; a high priority should be granted to permits for housing ; the proportion
aV j 1 f° r ous ' n & need to be allocated between housing for different sections of the community
and different locations. In addition, the accumulation of delayed maintenance work will make it necessary
to a PP ort i°n available building resources between new building, repairs and alterations, so that there
will be need for continuance of the present control of major repairs and additions as well as of new building.
152. We are of the opinion that the present system of permits for building should be continued,
and that the allocation of building resources should be made in this way. As we have recommended that
t A iat u annUa * ousin 2 Programme for the Commonwealth after approval by the Commonwealth Planning
Authority be allocated by the Commonwealth Housing Authority to each State (see paragraph 376), and
as it is most desirable that there should be no “ bottle-necks ” to hold up expeditious progress in house
construction in the post-war years, WE RECOMMEND that permits in respect of housing (new
construction, improvements and/or maintenance to existing dwelling units) be issued, in accordance
with government policy, by local government authorities under the direction and supervision of the
State Housing Authority, but that where housing projects, involving construction of group estates by
government or semi-government authorities, have been approved in the State allocation of housing,
permits be not required.
153. The principles which we recommend should govern the allocation of housing between
individuals are set out in paragraphs 480-494.
(f) Manpower.
154. The question of possible shortages of manpower is discussed in Part X. It is not considered
practicable for the present control of manpower to be retained after the war, but it is suggested that
government action should be taken to increase the mobility of labour and its direction into channels
where it is most necessary, and to encourage men and women to train for those occupations for which
there will be the greatest need in order to carry on the post-war reconstruction programme.
B. NEED FOR GOVERNMENT ACTION TO SUPPLEMENT PRIVATE ENTERPRISE.
155. It has been apparent, for many years, that private enterprise, the world over, has not
adequately and hygienically housed the low-income group. Consequently, since the last war, there has
been a widespread growth of government housing schemes, especially in Europe. In the United States
of America, this development was delayed until the depression of the early 1930’5, but since then the
Federal Government has sponsored housing programmes. In Australia, the State Governments, as well
as the Commonwealth Government, have inaugurated housing schemes, but their effect on the total
housing problem has been small ; the annual average number of dwellings built for purchase through
government agencies during the period 1938-39 to 1940-41, was under 3,500, as compared with total
domestic building of about 40,000 dwellings a year for the same period. It is of note that the government
of Great Britain is planning to build four to five million homes in 10 to 12 years after the war, with an
annual expenditure of about £5OO m. to £6OO m.
156. An estimate of the present housing shortage in Australia is quoted in Part 111.
157. W consider it essential that, in Australia, the governments should accept responsibility
for ensuring adequate housing of the people, especially the low-income group. This will involve supple-
menting on a large scale building undertaken by private enterprise. The principal reasons for our opinion
are :
(a) government enterprise is able to offer more liberal terms and conditions than private
enterprise;
(b) private enterprise even before the war did not supply a sufficient number nor a reasonable
standard of dwellings for the low-income group;
(c) after the war, the domestic building industry will need to overcome the then housing
shortage, replace substandard dwellings, undertake slum clearance, fulfil the normal demand
for new dwellings and undertake repairs, which have been neglected because of wartime
restrictions. Private enterprise is not organised in a manner which could be expected to
undertake a building programme of this magnitude without being supplemented;
(d) building costs are much higher than before the war, and it is probable that high costs will
continue at least for a period after the war. It is, therefore, most improbable that private
enterprise will provide adequate housing for the low-income group after the war, any more
than it did prior to the war ; and
(e) mass production and/or bulk purchase of building materials, components of dwellings and
domestic equipment are important methods of reducing building costs, and these can be
most effectively implemented by government agencies, either by placing large orders with
private manufacturers or by undertaking manufacture in government factories.


C. NEED FOR THE COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT TO SUPPLEMENT ACTION
BY STATE GOVERNMENTS.
158. Housing is a national problem, and, in the past, the Commonwealth Government has found
it necessary to accept some responsibility for the housing of the people. The Commonwealth War
Service Homes Act, 1918, was enacted under defence powers and set up machinery for home purchase
on easy terms by discharged members of the services. The Commonwealth Housing Act, 1927-28, offered
finance to State and local organisations wishing to undertake housing subject to prescribed conditions.
More recently, the defence powers have been used to enable the erection of temporary and permanent
housing for war and essential workers. There is thus precedent for the interest of the Commonwealth
Government in the housing of the people. We consider it necessary that the Commonwealth Government
should take an active part in Government-financed housing for the following main reasons :
(a) at present, housing is carried out by a large number of different bodies. There is need
to co-ordinate housing activities throughout the Commonwealth. Every citizen of the
Commonwealth is entitled to a good standard house and this should not depend upon his
economic position nor the policy of the particular State in which he resides;
(b) the States have not dealt adequately with the housing of the people in the past, especially
the low-income group;
(c) any building done during war-time, or in the immediate post-war period, will be dependent
on the availability and distribution of building resources, which are at present controlled,
and the continuance cf which controls is recommended; (see paragraphs 145-148.)
( d) housing will have a large influence on the level of employment in the post-war period;
(e) the Commonwealth Government is responsible for the repatriation of defence personnel
and the merging of them into post-war civilian life, and housing will be one of their most
important needs ; and
(f) the financial resources of the Commonwealth Government are greater than those of
individual States ; thus the Commonwealth will be better able to provide the financial
assistance required.
159. Accordingly, WE RECOMMEND that the Commonwealth Government should take an active
part in housing and make finance available for that purpose. Details of the powers which should be
accorded a permanent Commonwealth Housing Authority are set out in paragraph 376.

(a) Need for National , Regional and Town Planning.
160. National and regional planning may be described as a conscious effort to guide the
development of the resources of the nation and their use in productive enterprise, so as to provide a
rising national income, and, therefore, a rising standard of human welfare including, inter alia , better
housing.
161. In the past, national development has been largely in the hands of private enterprise, and
has thus been governed by the possibilities of profit-making rather than by the needs of the community.
We consider that national, regional and town planning is an urgent national need.


162. A broad approach to national and regional planning may appear distant from a consideration
of housing. We consider, however, that housing is essentially an expression of the way of life of the
people, and that, therefore, it is impossible to separate housing from a consideration of the broader aspects
of the life of the people—from such questions, as how and where they earn their living, and how and
where they spend their leisure.
163. In the past, what planning has been done has been applied in a limited way to towns or
sections of towns. We are of the opinion that adequate planning can only be undertaken when firstly
the region and secondly the State or nation is considered as a whole. No small community can live by
itself. All are dependent on the production and on interchange with both adjacent and distant areas.
(b) Need for participation by the People in Planning.
164. National policy must affect in some manner every community and the life of all the people.
It is because of this that in paragraphs 190-197 and paragraphs 399-405 we stress the importance of setting
up an administration which will enable the people themselves to initiate proposals and participate in
formulating them. Planning should take place simultaneously from technicians employed by the
government administration, and from the people who will be affected by the planning. The desirable
approach to the problem of democratic planning is well set out in the organic planning part of the evidence
from the Modern Architectural Research Society, Perth, from which we quote hereunder :
“The Society considers that there are two kinds of planning:
“ (I) Bureaucratic Planning. This is planning carried out by authorities behind closed doors.
However well meaning individuals may be, it is possible that they misinterpret public
wishes and underestimate needs. It is also possible that authorities are not always
imaginative and tend to be restricted in outlook by over-familiarity with existing by-laws
and practices. It is the opinion of this Society that all things change, and can be changed,
and that this flexibility is missing from bureaucratic planning.
“ Planning of this nature imposes solutions of problems on the public, with or
without public support. It assumes the correctness of the solutions with amazing assurance
which precludes the possibility of experimental development.
“ (2) Organic Planning. This is based on the actual processes of life and directed to the
fulfilment of human needs as a governing objective. It allows for experiment as a major
feature, and is flexible enough to allow for changes of means, following experiment,
which occur during the process of implementation of a plan, and to allow for changes of
the plan itself, following changes of needs. Organic planning is carried out with the
utmost publicity, as a means of stimulating that public enthusiasm without which no plan
can be expected to succeed. Organic planning contains machinery whereby the wishes
of all sections of the population can be expressed and whereby public opinion can be
accurately gauged and taken into consideration.”
(c) Typical Problems of Regional and Town Planning in relation to Housing.
165. It is useful to list here the type of problems with which regional and town planning must be
concerned in relation to housing. The broad problems of land use for primary industry and the regional
distribution of secondary industry are outside the field of enquiry of this Commission. The problems
listed below concern these questions only where they are directly related to housing. They are designed
merely to indicate the type of problem which must be met by a planning authority. A further discussion
is included under Section Eof this Part—“ Replanning of Existing Cities.”
(1) Density of Population.
166. The density of population in particular town areas must be considered in relation to the open
spaces within each area, and therefore in relation to the type of housing provided ; this subject is discussed
fully in Section D.
(2) Transport Problems.
167. The unplanned development of towns has led to unplanned transport and to an excessive
amount of travelling between different parts of large towns. This in turn has involved high costs of
transport to the community as a whole, as well as to the individual who pays this cost not only in money
but in time and fatigue. Ribbon development in many places has caused unduly long travel and prejudiced
rapid transport ; uncontrolled subdivisions have been added to the outer fringe of towns from time to
time without any provision for transport ; many vacant allotments in subdivisions remain unbuilt on,
despite that all services are provided, while additional areas, still further out, are subdivided and Dut on
the market. * r
168. Transport authorities are reluctant to extend their services until they are convinced the
proposed extension will pay.
169. The rising price of land due to the absence of zoning for use has driven people to outer areas
before ChCap * loCat '° n has forced them t 0 pay hi S h fares ’ often ,eavi "g them worse off than
170 The replanning of our regions and towns should include provisions for quick transport from
residential areas, so as to reduce the travelling time required. The decentralisation of industry and the
possibility of establishing satellite towns will need to be considered in relation to Australian conditions


171. Provision for improved transport should take into consideration the following factors :
(i) Distance between home and work.
172. Evidence given to the Commission showed that a total of three hours or even longer is
sometimes spent by workers in travel to and from work. The Commission considers one hour, half
an hour’s journey each way, should be regarded as a reasonable limit of time. The more direct and the
faster the travel the further the workers can live from their work. For instance, if quick trains or
omnibuses pick men up close to their homes and deliver them close to their place of work, ten miles or
even further may be regarded as reasonable. Cn the other hand, badly planned or congested suburbs
and narrow roads would limit the distance to a few miles.
173. High fares are a serious handicap to many thousands of people, and only a vigorous policy
of replanning, involving decentralisation of industry, will effect a cure.
174. Fatigue induced by lengthy travel becomes a serious community loss if workers are forced
to spend long periods travelling, especially in crowded vehicles. This state of affairs is now aggravated
by war conditions but existed before the war in many towns.
(ii) Distance from homes to markets and shops.
175. Housewives should be able to obtain daily food needs within reasonable distances of their
homes.
176. The Commission considers local markets or shops should be provided in all thickly populated
areas within approximately a half mile of every dwelling unit.
177. We consider that State Planning and Housing Authorities in planning housing projects
should consult traffic authorities before planning any groups of houses, even if only small groups are
concerned. (See paragraph 398.)
(3) Partial Development of Certain Areas.
178. The unplanned growth of our towns has led to premature subdivisions in a large number
of areas. Many of these areas will remain for years in a partially settled condition. In these districts
the utilities and transport supplied are generally poor and the cost of supplying them is high. At the
same time land, which might have been retained for dairying or market gardening, etc., is thrown out of
production, and the distance which city dwellers must travel to country areas is unduly lengthened.
The planning of towns and regions will consolidate settlement, particularly if an attempt is made to limit
the expansion of present large towns.
(4) Lack of Sufficient Parks and Playgrounds.
179. Lack of planning in the past has meant that, in most large towns sufficient provision has
not been made for parks and playgrounds in all areas, though particular districts may be well supplied.
Lack of planning has allowed the foreshores of many rivers and harbours, which should be retained as
national playgrounds, to be alienated and pass into private ownership. Regional and town planning will
require a satisfactory distribution of parks and other open spaces. In order that the foreshores of
harbours, rivers, etc., may, in the future, be reserved to the people, WE RECOMMEND that legislation
be enacted that on the foreshores in town areas:
(i) no further alienation of land be permitted ;
(ii) no building or re-building be permitted except with the consent of the State Planning
Authority ; and
(iii) when and where buildings are demolished the land be resumed to a distance and to an
extent to be determined.
(d) Preliminary Planning.
180. We consider that control of land use should be in the hands of the government and be
administered through Commonwealth and State Planning Authorities (see paragraphs 200-206). We
realise, however, that considerable time must inevitably elapse before the implementation of uniform
controls of regional and town planning by legislation. There is, however, urgent need for rehousing
people now living in bad conditions, and for relieving the acute housing shortage, therefore, building
must not be delayed. Accordingly we consider that, pending the formation of detailed regional and
town plans, land in built-up areas should be zoned. This will provide the basis for interim control of
land use, and will assist decentralisation and the permament establishment of the zoned areas.
181. The control of land use should be a positive and a constructive one. It will be, however,
some years before these plans are complete. In order to ensure adequate control of land use during this
period WE RECOMMEND that zoning should be reinforced by power to declare “ housing development
areas ” as set out in Division I, Part VII, of the Model Housing Act (Appendix VI).
182. The proclamation of a “ housing development area ” should enable the State Housing
Authority, pending the setting up of the State Planning Authority, to control the subdivision or sale of
land within such an area, and should give the authority power to resume the land if it is not satisfied with
the use of such land.
183. In order to ensure that at least a minimum amount of planning is undertaken without delay,
WE RECOMMEND that conferences between the Commonwealth and the States be held to discuss:
(1) the enactment of regional and town planning legislation ; and
(2) pending (I), actual or visual zoning of areas to be developed for housing, reinforced by the
power to declare “ housing development areas.


184. Some States have already taken steps towards introducing regional and town planning
legislation. In our First Interim Report (dated 21st October, 1943), we recommended that consideration
be given to the establishment as soon as possible of a Commonwealth Planning Authority, representative
of national works, rural industries, secondary industries, and housing, to formulate a national plan to
control, co-ordinate and direct national development arising, inter alia , from regional and town planning.
In March, 1944, the Commonwealth called a conference on regional planning which was attended by
government officials from all States. It is desirable that this should be followed by further conferences,
which will help to build a uniform approach to planning problems throughout the Commonwealth.
185. We consider that planning is of such importance that the Commonwealth Government
should not make available financial assistance for housing (see paragraph 544) unless the State concerne
satisfies the Commonwealth that it has taken or is taking definite steps to enact and implement regional
and town planning legislation.
B. PRINCIPLES OF REGIONAL AND TOWN PLANNING.
(a) General.
186. Planning must include provision for the particular conditions of each area. Any rigidity
of design or layout is a negation of the very idea of planning. Although the basis of planning must be
long-term development, planning must be flexible both as between different areas and over a period of
time. It is impossible for planners to visualise now the possible changes in the organisation production
which may take place over the next twenty or fifty years. Advances in transport may also require a
large-scale variation in planning. Should civil aviation develop very rapidly, the location of residential
and even industrial centres may be greatly affected. One of the major criticisms of town planning as
applied in the Australian Capital Territory is that insufficient allowance has been made in the past for
adapting the plan to changing needs.
187. Despite the need for flexibility in planning, both as between different areas and as between
p2riods of time, definite principles can be laid down as fundamental to any plan.
188. Such principles are being drawn up by an advisory Town Planning Committee appointed by
the Ministry of Post-War Reconstruction.
189. A Model Housing Act which contains certain provisions for town planning is set out in
Appendix Vl—these provisions are intended to operate until satisfactory town planning legislation is
enacted, and general planning information, which may be used as a basis for the details of any town plan,
is included in Appendix XX.
(b) Outline of Administration for Regional and Town Planning.
190. The success of regional and town planning must depend to a large extent on the method
of administration and, accordingly, we suggest that the implementation of regional and town planning
should be through the following bodies :
(1) Commonwealth Regional and Town Planning Council;
(2) State Regional and Town Planning Councils; and
(3) Local government authorities.
(1) Commonwealth Regional and Town Planning Council.
191. At the Commonwealth level a Commonwealth Regional and Town Planning Council should
be established as a section of the Commonwealth Planning Authority with powers to :
(i) promote and co-ordinate policies on regional and town planning, especially with respect to :
(a) use and development of all land;
( b) movements, distribution and growth of the population;
(c) distribution of industrial activities so as to secure a balanced economic development of
primary, secondary and other industries ; and
(d) amelioration of the conditions of urban and rural life;
(ii) suggest general principles for regional and town planning, with which State, regional and
local authorities shall comply, after due regard to local conditions;
(iii) undertake relevant research, including collation of material from overseas;
(iv) form a clearing house of planning research, and disseminate information; and
(v) co-ordinate and enforce planning schemes, where State boundaries form an arbitrary
interruption of the area to be planned.
(2) State Regional and Town Planning Councils.
192. At the State level a State Regional and Town Planning Council should be established as a
section of the State Planning Authority, and should consist of a limited number of members appointed
on account of their technical knowledge of various phases of the subject.
193. The Council should have power to co-opt members to collaborate and advise on certain
subjects.


194. The functions of this Council should be to :
(i) delegate any or all of its powers to a local government authority or group of local government
authorities, referred to herein as a regional planning council ;
(ii) initiate surveys and co-ordinate existing knowledge in all areas concerned ;
(iii) co-ordinate existing plans of development for the whole or part of the State ;
(iv) initiate, in broad outline, plans of development for the whole or part of the State ;
(v) require any regional planning council or local government authority to prepare plans for
the areas within its boundaries, and submit them for approval, amendment or rejection ;
and
(vi) lay down standards with regard to town planning, with which local government authorities
must comply, when planning new areas or replanning existing areas, and to offer technical
assistance in preparing these plans ;
(vii) control planning by power to :
(a) enforce planning schemes ;
(b) declare any area in the State a housing development area ;
(c) issue to any regional planning council or to any local government authority an order
for the development of a particular area of land ;
( d) control and approve subdivision of land ;
(viii) enforce re-parcelling schemes where it is considered that land is held of such shape, size
or alignment as to prevent it being put to its best use ; and
(ix) approve or refuse an application by a local government authority or regional planning
council to prepare a town planning scheme, either as to the whole or any part of the area
to which it applies.
(3) Local Government Authorities.
195. We have already emphasised the importance of ensuring that as much planning as possible
is undertaken at the local level, and we are of the opinion that at this level planning should be undertaken
by local government authorities or a group of local government authorities herein referred to as a regional
planning council. The planning functions of these authorities should be :
(i) to develop land in accordance with the terms of the order issued by the State Regional
and Town Planning Council ;
(ii) to form either a separate local planning authority or become a party to a regional planning
council, as the State Regional and Town Planning Council may think desirable ;
(iii) where the State Regional and Town Planning Council has delegated its powers to prepare
within a stipulated time a planning scheme in respect of all land to be developed within
its boundaries and to submit such scheme to the State Regional and Town Planning Council
for approval ; and
(iv) to encourage local residents to take an active interest in the planning of the area.
196. Every person appointed to represent a constituent authority on a regional planning council
must be a member of such authority.
197. All planning schemes should be prepared by persons who, in the opinion of the State Planning
Authority, are qualified to do the work.
C. COMMONWEALTH AND STATE PLANNING AUTHORITIES.
(a) Relation between Commonwealth, State and Regional Planning Authorities.
198. As stated earlier in this Part, plans for any area must affect life in adjacent areas. There is
thus need for a national plan as well as regional plans. In addition, the Commonwealth is responsible for
the rehabilitation and the re-establishment of ex-service personnel, and has, also, announced its desire
to pursue a policy of full employment. Thus it is concerned in securing uniformity and co-ordination of
the planning bodies of the States. We are of the opinion that the most satisfactory co-ordination and
implementation of plans, especially for the control of land use, would be achieved by :
(1) the establishment of a Commonwealth Planning Authority vested with powers, inter alia ,
of review of State plans for land use, where they affect national development, and with the
function of obtaining co-ordinated development under uniform State legislation and
administrative machinery ;
(2) the establishment of State Planning Authorities to have co-ordinating and supervisory
functions in the States ;
(3) the adoption of uniform principles of regional and town planning in all States, satisfactory
to the Commonwealth ; and
(4) the preparation at the request of the State Planning Authority through regional and town
planning councils (see paragraphs 192-194), of regional and town plans for the use and
development of all land. These plans should be based on full investigations made by or
through departmental officers and/or local advisory committees.
199. In case the powers of the various authorities mentioned hereafter may appear unduly to
stress annual budgeting for housing, we would emphasise that we consider long-term planning in all
fields to be of the utmost importance, so as to provide continuity in the flow of finance, and the supp y of
labour and materials. Frequent reviews of these long-term plans will be necessary, however, to allow
modifications to meet changing conditions.


(b) Commonwealth Planning Authority.
200. For the reasons discussed earlier in this Part WE RECOMMEND that a Commonwealth
Planning Authority should be established by legislation and be subject to the Minister charged with the
administration of national planning.
201. The Commonwealth Planning Authority should advise the Minister regarding national and
regional planning and be responsible for preparing plans for carrying out Government policy. It should
consider housing in relation to other national activities, but would not be concerned in any way with
detailed administration of housing. Until the final form of the Commonwealth Planning Authority has
been determined, we are of the opinion that its functions should be carried out by the Ministry of Post-
War Reconstruction.
202. WE RECOMMEND that the general functions of the Commonwealth Planning Authority
should be, inter alia :
(1) to survey, investigate and report upon the physical and economic resources of Australia ;
(2) to co-ordinate the work being planned in existing Commonwealth Departments and by
State Planning Authorities (see paragraphs 204-206) ;
hlote. —This will be particularly necessary in the immediate post-war
period, in view of the probable shortage of some resources and the need
for re-establishing defence personnel and war workers.
(3) to formulate a plan to develop primary and secondary industries, national works, housing,
the general economic structure of the community, and, in particular, to foster and encourage
regional and town planning (see paragraphs 190-197) ;
(4) to maintain contact with all organisations concerned with planning so that planning is not
imposed from the top, but takes place simultaneously through the various bodies concerned ;
(5) eventually, to direct the planning of existing Commonwealth Departments concerned and
to advise State Governments so that the plans of different sections will agree with the general
plans for the Commonwealth ; and
(6) to supervise the activities of the proposed Commonwealth Community Facilities Committee
(see paragraph 842).
203. The establishment and functions of a Commonwealth Housing Authority are considered in
paragraphs 371-389. WE RECOMMEND that the particular functions of the Commonwealth Planning
Authority in the housing field should be—
(1) to relate housing policy to national activities ;
(2) to exercise such co-ordination and control as will ensure, according to needs, the proper
distribution of building resources between all forms of building ;
(3) to consider tne programme of Commonwealth and State works including housing ;
(4) in collaboration with the Commonwealth Housing Authority to assess the size of the housing
programme for the Commonwealth and its allocation to the States and Commonwealth
territories ; and
(5) to consider, in collaboration with the Commonwealth Housing Authority, appeals from
any State or local housing body against the decision of the State Planning Authority or State
Housing Authority.
(c) State Planning Authority.
204. We consider that each State should be asked to set up a State Planning Authority, though
this should not be a condition of Commonwealth financial assistance for housing. In some States the
rudiments of such an authority already exist, and the State Government may prefer to give extended
planning functions to some existing bodies. The need for a State Planning Authority is urged because
of the need to have a State body, which can co-ordinate plans for general economic development, of which
housing is only a part.
205. The State Planning Authority should be empowered, inter alia:
(1) to co-ordinate the planning of existing State Departments, in respect of housing, public
works, transport, water conservation, electrification, etc. ;
(2) on the basis of the co-ordination in (I), to build up a plan for future development, and, in
particular, to foster and control regional and town planning ;
(3) eventually to direct the planning of existing departments and to co-operate in the planning
of the regions so that the plans of all sections shall agree with the plans of the State built
up as in (2) ;
Note.—lt should be emphasised that planning of this type cannot be
rigid, and must be subject to continuous review.
(4) to collate plans submitted periodically by the bodies concerned (including housing—see
paragraph 206), to co-ordinate and, if necessary, amend these plans to agree with the
programme for the State as a whole, and when approved to forward these plans to the
Commonwealth Planning Authority ; and
(5) in relation to community facilities to supervise the activities of the proposed State
Community Facilities Committee (see paragraph 841).


206. The establish merit and functions of a State Housing Authority are considered in paragraphs
390-398. The particular functions of the State Planning Authority in the housing field should be :
(1) to review the housing programme for the State submitted by the State Housing Authority
after compilation from the estimated requirements of different housing bodies within the
State ;
(2) to receive periodic reports from the State Housing Authority on the progress of the housing
programme ; and
(3) where necessary, to review the re-allocation by the State Housing Authority of the total
housing programme between participant bodies.
D. DENSITY.
(a) General Considerations.
207. Density, as related to regional and town planning, might be defined as the ratio between
a given area of land and the number of dwellings (or the number of persons living therein) accommodated
on that area of land. The ideal density for any site is governed by the welfare of the inhabitants and is
derived from the most effective co-ordination of the varioGs complex problems peculiar to each site and
to each set of circumstances. Density, therefore, may be related to three main divisions, namely, urban,
suburban and rural, and is generally stated at so many dwelling units to the acre.
208. In the suburban and rural divisions, examination shows that in this country there is generally
some relationship between the actual and the ideal. But this is not the case in urban residential districts.
It can definitely be stated that overcrowding exists in Australian towns, and that there are substandard
areas due for clearance. This overcrowding is not only the result of wartime conditions, nor is it entirely
due to the housing shortage. It has its origin in the accumulative effects of a “ laissez-faire ” attitude of
many years’ standing.
209. Our statement of this problem has been made particularly difficult because there are so few
statistics relating to Australian conditions. The exact extent of the problem cannot be stated without
proper surveys. It is possible, however, to draw on the great amount of theoretical and factual evidence
applying to similar problems, and from this to indicate salient factors as they relate to local conditions.
( b ) Factors affecting Density.
210. The factors which govern development of areas and hence set the scale of density are :
(1) background of existing conditions;
(2) health ;
(3) reservation percentage for roads, amenities, commerce, etc. ;
(4) cost ; and
(5) sociological.
211. These factors are related to the following types of areas in which housing will take place :
(i) In entirely new developments;
(ii) In partly built-up areas ; and
(iii) In clearance areas.
(1) Background of Existing Conditions.
212. Densities for housing schemes in partially built-up areas and slum clearance should be studied
against the background of the surrounding conditions. Consideration should be given to the character
of the existing neighbourhood and the character it may be expected to assume in any future planned
development. Any new planning scheme, except where it reduces population numbers, might either
overload community facilities and public utilities of neighbouring areas, or find itself overloaded.
(2) Health.
213. The health factor affects the relative number and placing of dwelling units, so as to allow
the admission of sunlight and fresh air into dwellings, and also the number of storeys advisable in multi-
storey dwellings with or without lifts.
214. Conditions allowing the admission of sunlight into dwellings have been studied in England
and the United States of America. The most generally approved method of spacing dwelling units in
England is by the use of light angles. Buildings must be spaced far enough apart to allow the light angles
at 45° over an adjoining roof to strike the lowest window sill of the next building.
215. In the United States of America, certain authorities adopt as an ideal minimum standard
that each living room and bedroom in a dwelling should have a minimum of one half-hour’s sunlight at
the winter solstice, or, if aspect does not so permit, that it must get reflected light from the sky at IJ times
the stipulated sunlight factor.
216. In Australia, there is no reason why this minimum should not be far surpassed, as is already
the case where correct planning and orientation have been observed. In other words, the accepted
density already determined by the average suburban lot size in Australian subdivisions, provides good
conditions for sunlight, provided orientation is considered as an essential factor in planning.
217. In groups of multi-storey dwellings, height of buildings must also be considered, i.e., the
higher the buildings the further they should be apart.


218. Therefore, to increase density for economic or other reasons in groups of nriulti-storey
dwellings by spacing that disregards solar planning, or by increasing storey numbers without other
ameliorating features violates health principles.
(3) Reservation Percentage for Roads and Amenities.
219. Density figures when stated as gross relate the total number of dwelling units, or the
population, to the land area, including roads, parks, playgrounds, etc.
(4) Cost.
220. Money outlay has influenced density in the past. Expediency, desire for monetary profit,
or sheer necessity has governed schemes in which the maximum possible number of dwellings is crowded
on to sites. Even the slum clearance schemes undertaken by the London County Council since the last
war contributed little to reduction in population density ; its problem, particularly with regard to high
land costs, was admittedly a difficult one.
22L The aim of private speculators has been to obtain the maximum number of frontages in the
case of subdivisions, or the maximum number of dwelling units in groups of multi-storey dwellings,
although it cannot be said that private speculators always abuse their opportunities in this regard.
Local government bodies in this country have tried to prevent undue exploitation by fixing a minimum
lot size and maximum site coverage, but much harm was already done in the inner sections of the older
Australian towns before more enlightened regulations were introduced. High density in certain inner
areas has caused inflated land values ; and, on the other hand, low densities can increase cost by the extra
expense involved in making roads, providing services, etc.
222. These facts on densities as related to costs should be noted by Australian authorities in
connection with local replanning schemes and new developments.
(5) Sociological.
223. It must be borne in mind always that the purpose of slum clearance and housing is to provide
better living conditions. The human element is the first consideration.
224. Thne present city population congestion is not necessarily a matter of preference. In our
large cities it is clear that large groups of multi-storey dwellings offer the only solution alternative to
the mass migration of the rehoused population to outer areas. The latter course has the defect of
spreading out cities so that they become even less efficient than at present.
225. A realistic approach to the problem has been taken in the London County Council plan,
which acknowledges that in rehousing London, it will be necessary to allow for a fairly high density at
the core, which will be able to decrease in radial rings towards the outskirts of the city. It is claimed
that with proper planning for orientation, amenities and health, the larger densities will not be an
unsurmountable handicap.
(c) Density Figures.
226. Gross density is the number of dwelling units per acre over the total area of a given
development, including roads, parks and playgrounds.
227. Net density is the number of dwelling units per acre over the actual area of the unit sites
or allotments in any given development area.
228. Authorities in various countries have adopted desirable density figures, arrived at to suit
their own population conditions and with due regard for such items as have been outlined above. In this
country to date, in any but the old, developed city areas, population density standards in built-up areas
have been generally set by local government authorities at low figures. Until the advent of State housing
authorities, however, no official cognisance was taken of public amenity areas in relation to density. The
growth of the capital cities, and the probable growth of our country towns emphasise the immediate
need for the establishment of some standard density basis for replanning and future development.
229. The Commission has given consideration to the desirable density of housing in Australian
towns. We have had research carried out on all the factors mentioned above, which have a bearing on
regulating this density. It is clear, that this scientific investigation into health factors, such as access
of sunlight and air, can assist in establishing densities, but the other human factors cannot be measured
in scientific terms, as for example, the size of garden and yard space for family use and the desirable degree
of privacy ; these latter are a matter of opinion. In making our decisions we have first of all examined the
scientific results and then have modified them where necessary by judgment of human needs.
230. We have recommended that the minimum area of allotment for a single-dwelling unit be
4,500 square feet. If an area were subdivided to this standard it would result in a maximum net density
of 9.68 dwelling units per acre or 35.9 persons per acre, allowing the Australian average of 3.7 persons
per dwelling unit based on the 1933 census. However, we do not suggest that large areas be subdivided
into these minimum size allotments as it would impede the flexibility which a good layout demands.
We consider that a variety of allotment sizes is desirable, and therefore there should be in areas of single
unit dwellings, a maximum net density of eight dwelling units to the acre.
231. In the case of attached dwelling units not more than two storeys in height we have
recommended a minimum area of 3,600 square feet per unit. An area subdivided to this standard would
result in a maximum net density of 12.1 dwelling units per acre. For the reasons outlined above, we
feel that large areas should not be subdivided to this standard, and, therefore, we consider that the
maximum net density in areas of attached dwelling units should be eleven dwelling units per acre.
*92l:lo—c


232. In the case of areas of multi-storey dwellings density should be based on the desirability of
obtaining sunlight in the windows of the living room and bedrooms at some period of the day between
9 a.m. and 3 p.m. in midwinter, and, taking into account certain assumptions set out in Appendix XX,
which are based on Sydney conditions, the net density of dwelling units per acre would vary between
38.6 for a three-storey and 63.0 for a twelve-storey building, according to the placing of the building in
relation to compass points. This is equivalent to a net density of population varying from 142 for three-
storey to 233 for twelve-storey buildings per acre. From the data in Appendix XX, based on Sydney
conditions, it will be seen that the highest net density is possible where the blocks run in a north-south
direction. Where they run in an east-west or diagonal direction the net density will be lower. It will
be seen also that the net density increases with the number of storeys but not proportionately. Data
in Appendix XX, sheet P4Bb, indicates the distance between multi-storey blocks under varying conditions
in relation to their orientation. In subtropical and tropical areas, the spacing of dwelling units also needs
to be based on the particular requirements of open space, circulation of air, privacy, etc. ; the cooling
of dwelling units, rather than the penetration of sunlight will be the problem ; the position of windows,
width of verandahs, eaves, aspects of rooms, etc., are all influenced by solar planning considerations.
233. We have weighed the above scientific data, and, taking into consideration the desirable living
conditions, have reached certain conclusions. Accordingly, WE RECOMMEND that density and siting
should be governed by the following factors :
(1) in an area of single dwelling units the maximum net density shall be eight dwelling units
per acre subject to the following :
(i) the proportion of allotment covered by building shall not exceed one-third of the
total area;
(ii) the allotment shall not be less than 4,500 square feet, with a minimum width of position
where dwelling is erected of 50 feet;
(iii) in temperate zones the living room and main bedroom of each unit shall have windows
capable of admitting sunlight for a period of at least one hour between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m.
midwinter;
(2) in an area of attached dwelling units the maximum net density shall be eleven dwelling units
per acre subject to the following :
(i) the proportion of unit site covered by buildings shall not exceed one-third;
(ii) the unit site shall not be less than 3,600 square feet per dwelling unit;
(iii) In temperate zones the living room and main bedroom of each unit shall have windows
capable of admitting sunlight for a period of at least one hour between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m.
midwinter;
(3) in areas of multi-storey dwellings of more than two storeys in height the maximum net
density of dwelling units on any area shall be forty dwelling units per acre subject to the
following :
(i) the proportion of unit site covered by buildings shall not exceed one-third;
(ii) in temperate zones the living room and main bedroom of each unit shall have windows
capable of admitting sunlight for a period of at least one hour between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m.
in midwinter;
(iii) buildings shali not be erected in such a way that they reduce to less than one hour
between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. in midwinter the period in which sunlight has access to the
whole windows of the living room and main bedroom of dwelling units in adjacent
buildings;
(iv) the minimum distance from street alignments shall not be less than 15 feet. The
minimum distance from side boundaries or existing buildings shall not be less than
20 feet ; for each storey above three storeys the building shall be set back a further
3 feet ; and
(v) the location and siting of multi-storey dwellings in respect to individual unit sites
should be subject to the approval of the State Planning Authority regarding density
distribution.
Note. —The above recommendation is general, and should apply to
all government-sponsored housing (which includes government-financed
housing), and should be a condition of financial assistance to government-
financed housing.
234. As an example of the advantages of multi-storey dwellings in inner city areas, and, as an
indication of the density recommended, the accompanying sketch illustrates an area of nine acres originally
developed with old-fashioned two-storey terrace houses at approximately 37 units to the acre, when
replanned to provide the same number of dwelling units, but in three-storey buildings and one five-storey,
gives a large proportion of the total area for playgrounds, park and garden spaces. (This sketch is adapted
from one submitted by the Modern Architectural Research Society, Perth.)
235. Except in existing areas of high density, such as some inner city areas, we do not recommend
that the suggested maximum net density of 40 dwelling units to the acre for areas of multi-storey dwellings
be applied as a general standard. As previously stated, we regard it as essential that a mixture of single
attached and multi-storey dwellings be planned in any large area.


236. Considering partly built-up areas and slum clearance as a whole, local conditions can be
compared to conditions overseas, inasmuch as our older cities have an inner residential core which includes
slum districts, and from which centre the population density drops over more or less radial belts to the
minimum density of the outer suburbs. The solution of this problem would appear to be one of two
alternatives, both involving much wider questions than density and housing alone.
237. Firstly—the possibility of decentralisation of business and industry ; this idea is demonstrated
in the satellite town theory, thus ensuring population reduction and allowing re-building to be done on a
lower density basis.
238. Secondly—the possibility of integrating town and suburbs in a comprehensive re-building
scheme observing good town planning principles in zoning, solar planning, open areas, etc. It should be
noted that it may be necessary to maintain in the city proper a density more or less comparable with
existing conditions, but grouped for the most part in multi-storey dwellings spaced according to solar
planning.
239. Without some such large scale attack, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to prevent the
uncontrolled spread of cities.

E. REPLANNING EXISTING TOWNS.
(a) General Considerations.
(1) Introduction.
240. The development of regional planning will probably lead to the establishment of some new
towns, and to the growth of some existing small country towns to such an extent that their planning will
involve practically a new beginning. The replanning of existing large towns will, however, present great
and complex problems. Whilst this is generally recognised as true of the large capital cities, particularly
Sydney and Melbourne, it is unfortunately also true of most, if not all, large towns.
241. The task of replanning our towns has now become a major national problem. This great
task confronts Australia as something not only urgent but inevitable, something that will become more
difficult and costly the longer it is delayed—costly, not only in terms of money, but in human life destroyed
wasted, dwarfed and denied full development ; costly also in wastage of time and precious natural
resources.
242. The replanning of towns is recognised as a major problem in many countries and has received
a great incentive in Europe because of the destruction caused by war. Without doubt, many European
towns will be replanned in the light of present knowledge of human needs. England, in spite of the
urgent needs of war is now preparing detailed surveys and final schemes for the replanning of most of her
large towns.
243. The task of replanning a great city will mean continuous work by an expert staff for many
years. Australia must face the task involved in the replanning of our great centres of population, in the
light of modern knowledge, transport, national works and housing, as well as the modern needs of living
and social security. Conflicting interests, private rights, outworn scales of values and lack of vision are
difficulties which must be faced and overcome.
244. The actual implementing of a plan, whilst necessarily the function of constituted authority,
is also the concern of private firms and individual citizens.
(2) Stages in Preparation of a Re-planning Scheme.
245. A preliminary survey must be made, which, in many cases, may involve only the collection
of additional data or the compilation of maps in addition to those already in existence.
246. The survey should be undertaken in close contact with all the authorities concerned,
including Commonwealth, State and local government authorities controlling any public service, such as
water supply, electric energy, sewage disposal, main roads and rivers, education department, etc. To
facilitate the work of the future replanning of the built-up areas, it is suggested that local government
authorities should collect data now, which should be collated and plotted according to survey technique
agreed upon.
247. The stages in the preparation of a town plan are as follows :
(i) preparation of a preliminary scheme with a proper consideration of the objectives;
(ii) consideration of the preliminary scheme by local government authorities, and inspection
by residents who may lodge objections if they so desire;
(iii) preparation of draft scheme containing the results of any amendments suggested by local
government authorities, residents and various experts concerned;
(iv) submission of draft scheme to all authorities whose administrative areas are adjoining or
cutting across the area to be replanned;
(v) preparation of final scheme;
(vi) consideration of final scheme by local government authorities and inspection by residents;
(vii) submission of scheme to the State Planning Authority for approval by the Minister, and
after approval thereof a copy to the Commonwealth Planning Authority for its information ;
and
(viii) the incorporation of the scheme into the by-laws of the authority concerned.
(3) Road Plans.
248. The replanning of any built-up areas will involve a careful study of roads.
249. Road accidents for many years have been a serious drain on our population, on hospital
accommodation, motor repair shops, as well as local government authority staffs, police court officials,
etc., but probably the worst feature of badly designed road systems has been the toll on child life and
the lack of safety for residents near roads carrying a large quantity of high-speed traffic.
250. Not all the losses, human and otherwise, could be saved by better planning of roads in
relation to dwelling units, shopping, schools and other community facilities, but without doubt, a
considerable proportion could be avoided.
251. Loss of time in large towns in travelling from one part to another due principally to defective
planning, halts at intersections, and congestion in streets too narrow for the traffic carried, represent one
of the most serious defects of towns as organic units.


252. The replanning of towns should be based on a road system ; these road systems should
be designed with consideration for a greatly increased number of motor vehicles when peacetime
conditions are resumed, and with particular attention to the need for providing parking areas adjacent to
shopping and commercial centres.
253. Most of the roads in our urban areas cannot be identified with any particular function.
Major and minor roads often have the same width and receive the same treatment ; the primary demand
with regard to urban traffic planning is clear classification of the traffic lanes according to their functions.
The width, design, plantation and other features should largely depend upon the function of the road and
the volume of traffic it shall ultimately carry. Through-traffic roads require other features than business
roads, just as residential roads require different treatment from industrial roads.
254. Many roads have been laid out without considering the contours of the land, thereby causing
a number of difficulties such as steep inclines. Data relating to this subject are set out in “ Housing
Planning Principles,” Appendix XX.
255. All intersections between major and minor roads in closely built-up areas should be controlled
by “ roundabouts ” or traffic lights. Intersections between minor roads and service roads should be
limited in number.
256. The provision of these precautions would involve many costly and far-reaching changes to
roads in Australian towns, but the Commission considers that local government authorities controlling
closely built-up areas should study their areas and plan for the gradual introduction of a modern treatment
of their road systems, particularly at intersections.
257. Although many local government authorities have enriched their districts with nature strips
and trees in streets, the Commission noted many areas lacking these features, especially in thickly-populated
areas in towns. In replanning substandard and overbuilt areas, when alterations to roads are being
decided, paths, nature strips and street trees should receive careful consideration.
258. The Commission considers that local government authorities should provide night lighting
of roads in closely built-up areas. In replanning schemes this question should receive full consideration.
Modern methods aiming at illuminating the whole of the road surfaces but designed to avoid glare in
neighbouring dwellings should be used.
(4) Open Spaces, Park Systems and Green Belt.
259. The provision of open spaces in Australian cities is very poor in many congested areas.
To correct this defect, it will be necessary to purchase areas of various sizes, distributed as necessary.
260. For example in Sydney and Melbourne, no inner suburb has either a total area, or a
distribution arrangement of open spaces that is nearly adequate. Whilst without careful surveys, it
would not be possible to list towns failing in this respect, evidence in many parts of Australia, submitted
to the Commission, has shown that the provision of open spaces in built-up areas is inadequate in most
large towns and, particularly, in the suburbs of the capital cities.
261. Reducing hours of work with the consequent growth of leisure periods, the development
of youth movements, the National Fitness Council’s emphasis on physical training, and the increasing
demand for playing fields for organised games, all point to the need for more and better arranged spaces
in our towns. It is absurd and incongruous that Australia, the land of sun and wide, open spaces should
have so large a proportion of the population of the nation denied the use of adequate open spaces.
262. The Commission considers that areas of open spaces on the basis indicated in Appendix XX,
sheet P4Ba, per thousand people should be provided to supply the needs of all sections of the people.
It is suggested that these areas should be divided as follows :
(i) amenity parks and parkways (roads or pedestrian ways with strips of open space alongside);
(ii) general playing fields for adults, adolescents and school children;
(iii) school playing fields to conform with the latest educational requirements;
(iv) recreation and sports centres;
(v) small play centres for children near where they live;
(vi) smaller amenity open spaces in the form of formal squares and rest gardens;
(vii) river banks and foreshores;
(viii) amenity open spaces between adjacent communities and in business and industrial areas—
in the latter case also acting as a division between industry and adjoining residential areas ;
and
(ix) open areas adjacent to multi-storey dwelling units.
263. No hard and fast division of these areas can be made, but in the proposed London plan, half
of the total is suggested to be used for general playing fields, school playing fields, recreation and sports
centres. The equipped playing fields should be used by school teams during the week and sports clubs
in evenings and week ends. This arrangement is now frequent in Australia where local government
bodies generally control the grounds. This does not apply so much to younger children for whom special
grounds are required. These should be associated with schools, but available for use by children outside
of school hours.
264. Many schools in centres of population in Australia have insufficient play spaces not only in the
school grounds, but also adjacent thereto. This should be one of the first defects remedied.
265. All forms of open space in a community should be considered as a whole and be co-ordinated .
Qther aspects of this subject are dealt with in Part XVI, “ Community Facilities.”


266. Outside the town a “ green belt ” should be established ; this green belt should limit the
town growth, and should be linked by the parkways with open spaces within the various communities.
In this way, inter-penetration of greenery from the country into the city could be achieved. The city
dweller could go to open country through open spaces from garden to park, from park to parkway, thence
to the green belt. Instead of the country being continuously pushed away as a city grows, thus depriving
citizens of the natural joy of the country, except by long journeys, the country would permanently
penetrate the city.
267. All built-up communities should make definite plans to “ put their house in order ” regarding
open spaces as soon as possible after the war. Plans should be made immediately to prevent, if possible,
the erection of new buildings on areas which may be required for this purpose.
268. Pending the preparation of a town plan, a survey should be prepared by each local government
authority setting out open spaces existing and desirable in the light of the ultimate population, which
survey should be submitted for the approval of the State Planning Authority. The local government
authority should resume by compulsory purchase sufficient land for its requirements. Legislation, where
needed, to implement these proposals, should be introduced in the respective State Parliaments as soon
as possible.
269. The development of open spaces, such as filling, levelling, grading and planting, should be
vigorously pursued by each local government authority as a policy, using their permanent staffs for this
work, plus technical assistance, as needed from time to time.
(5) Planning for Community Facilities.
270. A survey of all existing facilities in each town must be made, showing not only all the social
amenity buildings in the area, but their structural condition and the degree of their use. Traditions and
customs grow up in settled areas and these must be studied, and, if necessary, developed. For instance,
in one area a large boys’ club may be in existence, and in another, a dramatic society or a well-established
gymnasium may flourish.
271. In Part XVI we discuss principles to be followed in establishing community facilities, such
as how the neighbourhood should be served by different facilities, the facilities required in areas of multi-
storey dwellings and questions of control and finance,
( b) Finance.
272. Replanning in built-up areas in towns will cost large sums of money over many years. Some
of this money will show a return, but a big proportion of the funds spent will have to be written off, being
absorbed in excess land values and in converting land areas to public uses, such as alterations to and
widening of roads, creation of parks, playgrounds, etc.
273. Many proposed city improvement and slum abolition plans have not been carried out in
other parts of the world, because of lack of finance, the old bad conditions continuing and in many cases
becoming worse year by year.
274. Further discussion on this subject is included in Part XV, “ Slum Clearance.”
275. A replanning scheme in a town or city is inevitably a long-range plan. A properly planned
scheme can be used as a means of establishing a national construction programme in various parts of the
country. Whenever it appears likely that ordinary building projects are falling off, some items of the
replanning scheme can be put in hand. Not only will this, properly administered, provide work when
needed, but may carry in its train a large amount of private building. Had any of our towns had such
a plan during the last depression work could have been provided when needed with much permanent
benefit to the town concerned.
276. The whole community benefits from the implementing of a replanning scheme ; therefore,
the community as a whole should contribute to the cost, but it is not easy to devise an equitable method
of spreading such costs. We have made a recommendation, in regard to the apportioning of losses, which
is included in paragraph 817.
277. The work of preparing surveys, preliminary sketches, estimates and final schemes is costly
and may be beyond the capacity of small local government authorities or groups of such authorities.
This work may be carried out by the State Planning Authority under some financial agreement with the
authority concerned or the State Planning Authority may make an advance to the local planning authority
so that the preliminary work can be undertaken, such an advance to be deemed portion of the cost of
the scheme.
(c) Recommendation.
278. WE RECOMMEND that in respect of regional and town planning :
(1) each State have included in its town planning legislation adequate provision to plan or
re-plan the whole or any part of a town ;
(2) the Commonwealth Government should subsidise any approved local government authority,
group of authorities or regional council in a replanning scheme, provided that the Common-
wealth Planning Authority has first approved thereof ; and
(3) the Commonwealth Government make loan money available for approved replanning
schemes.


F. TRAINING OF PHYSICAL PLANNERS.
(a) Town Planning in the Past.
279. Because of the absence of planning in our communities there has been practically no calling
for trained planners in the past. Any town planning has been superficial and restrictive, requiring certain
minimum standards to maintain health ; these have been administered by local government authont.es
Training in these fields was considered relatively unimportant and was confined to short courses included
as part of training for students in the professions of architecture, engineering and surveying.
(b) Planning in the Future.
280. The original scope of town planning has been extended in recent years to include planning on
a national and regional basis, as well as investigation of the extent and development of the national resources
of the country. As a result of this great extension of the subject, its treatment in existing courses is quite
inadequate for the purpose of giving a comprehensive training in regional and town planning.
281. If, as advocated, the future development of our cities, towns and countryside is to be
scientifically planned in the post-war period, then both facilities for the training of planners and the method
of training them will have to be expanded. There is need for more general regional and town planners
and also for persons trained to co-ordinate the work of different occupations related to planning, and to
correlate plans for different areas.
282. Our previous recommendations have envisaged planning at three levels :
(1) national;
(2) State and/or regional ; and
(3) town or local.
(1) National Planners. The form of national planning will depend to a large extent upon
the measure of State collaboration with the Commonwealth in physical planning. It is
reasonable to assume that, as the Commonwealth has not constitutional power over land
use, planning at the Commonwealth level will be more in the nature of advice and co-
ordination rather than direction. The national planners, therefore, are likely to be neither
administrators nor executive officers, but rather a team of specialists with partly the same
training as the regional and local planners, but with specific qualifications which enable them
to see the master plan as a whole, and yet not lose sight of the working in detail. The main
problems at this level will clearly concern those activities which are common to all parts of
Australia, especially distribution of population, of resources and of centres of production.
The planning staff will have to include persons trained in economics, geography, agriculture,
sociology, technology and administration, but the emphasis will be on economists and
geographers.
(2) State and/or Regional Planners. Like national planning, State planning is a new task
and its problems have to be resolved gradually. The planners at this level are nearer to the
actual schemes, and their experience will accordingly be different from those framing the
national plan. They must interpret the national policies and balance the local claims of
regions and communities in their State. The main problems will be concerned with the
network of services and communications, production and consumption, primary and
secondary industry, country and town. Many of the problems are outside the sphere of
town planners and administrative advisers. The planning staff would need to be composed
similarly to the national planning team with the emphasis on technical officers and
administrators.
It appears likely that regional planning will be a gradual development tending to
decentralise the functions of State departments and, therefore, the regional planning teams
will be composed similarly to those at the State level with similar emphasis.
(3) Town or Local Planners. Local planning will concern all the detailed problems of town
and contiguous areas. The training of town planners in the past has been limited in
conception to the boundaries of the town itself. Town or local planners will need to be
mainly architect and civil engineer planners, trained in the following fields :
(i) as co-ordinators with a detailed knowledge of a considerable part of the whole scope
of the work ;
(ii) ability to evaluate the importance of data ; and
(iii) ability to organise the work on the spot and deal with local government authorities.
283. From the foregoing outline, it is clear that planning is necessary at the three levels with
emphasis varying at each level.
284. Experiences of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and of the Tennessee Valley Authority
(U.S.A.) have shown that group organisation is the most satisfactory for tackling the various planning
jobs because of its flexibility.
(c) National School of Physical Planning.
285. The system of training in the common field of planning would best be achieved, not by
extension of existing courses, but through a National School of Physical Planning, embracing all planning
occupations. This School may have branches in several State capitals to facilitate training of those engaged
in practical work in the daytime and could have a close link with the Commonwealth and State departments,
responsible for physical planning, by having members of these departments on the controlling board of
the School.


286. A major function of the School would be research. A centre of information could be built
up which would be of tremendous assistance in establishing optimum standards of physical environment
in relation to human needs. Such standards have never been investigated on a comprehensive scale
under Australian conditions. Much valuable information has been gathered for particular areas (e.g ,
the Tropical Housing Committee in Queensland) but this requires co-ordinating and relating to other
national factors. 6
287. Urgent steps should be taken to ensure that administrators, professional men and technical
staff are trained adequately in their more limited spheres, and in sufficient numbers to carry out the
necessary preparatory planning steps. At present there are many men in government departments
with technical knowledge who could not be spared from their duties for full-time study, but who would
desire to obtain fundamental knowledge in the study and practice of planning. These are the ranks
from which many of the planners will have to be drawn.
288. WE RECOMMEND that the Commonwealth Government should establish a National School
of Physical Planning and that the details, theory and other relevant matters should be considered by a
special committee appointed for the purpose. 1
289. The following steps are also suggested :
(1) action be taken through the professional institutes to ensure that existing courses and
examinations, in the professions embracing planning, are of a sufficiently high standard to
provide a sound general knowledge of the subject ; and
(2) the subject of “ town planning ” in existing architectural and civil engineering courses
be made compulsory, where it is at present optional.
290. WE RECOMMEND that the Commonwealth Government should invite to Australia a
regional and town planner of professorial rank, to take up a position directing the National School of
Physical Planning and, also giving technical advice to the government on planning problems.
291. The Commonwealth Government should, in our opinion, arrange for the exchange of trained
technicians with Europe and the United States of America, and for a limited number of travelling
scholarships to be awarded to Australian technicians who are likely to benefit by overseas experience.
292. As the housing programme together with other building will demand the services of all
available technicians, we consider that they should be encouraged to remain in Australia both by the
offer of good facilities for responsible work within the country, and by the knowledge that travelling
scholarships are available.


Part VI. Land for Residential Purposes.
SUMMARY :A. General considerations.
8. Control of land use.
C. Limitation of private profit from land.
(a) General.
(b) Need for a uniform system of valuation by government authorities.
(c) Land nationalisation.
(d) Betterment tax.
(e) Other proposals.
D. Acquisition of land for housing purposes.
E. Need for immediate acquisition of land for housing.
A. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.
293. It is impossible to consider housing fully without considering also questions relating to the
use and price of land. Superficial investigation of the disabilities of housing in the past reveals that
housing has often been erected in unsuitable areas. In some areas housing has been placed adjacent to
heavy industries and noxious trades ; in other areas it has been too far from the place of work of the
occupants. There have been difficulties in the organisation of transport, and the extension of utilities ;
further, the cost of land in cities and large towns and, in some other areas, has been so great as to be a
burden to purchasers, and has operated most adversely to the housing satisfactorily of the low-income
groups. Speculative holding has forced up prices and kept out of use land which was needed by the people.
294. The main problems in connection with land for residential purposes, may be grouped under
three headings, as follows :
(a) difficulty of planning land use under the present system of unco-ordinated private ownership;
( b ) high and generally rising prices of land which have turned what should be the property
of the community, as a whole, into a means of making a profit for a comparatively small
number of individuals. Unearned increment accrues to private persons, and many people
are excluded from enjoyment of their rightful heritage. Rising land prices are due largely
to increasing population and to public utilities provided by the general taxpayer ; and
(c) difficulty in acquiring land for housing purposes and in assessing compensation for land
resumed.
B. CONTROL OF LAND USE.
295. In Part V we have discussed the need for control of land use and an administration for
effecting this control. Therefore, we do not propose to do more in this Part than again point to the
problem and refer to inquiries undertaken recently in Great Britain. Since 1937, three separate bodies
of inquiry have considered land matters. These are the Royal Commission on the Distribution of the
Industrial Population, appointed 1937 (Chairman, Sir Montague Barlow, Bt., P.C., K.8.E.), the Expert
Committee on Compensation and Betterment, appointed 1941 (Chairman, the Hon. Mr. Justice Uthwatt),
and the Committee on Land Utilisation in Rural Areas, 1942 (Chairman, Rt. Hon. Lord Justice Scott, P.C.).
The reports of these bodies show that land problems in Great Britain are acute, principally because failure
to control land use has led to a shortage of suitable land for various types of development.
296. The shortage is not so apparent in Australia, though it can be established that a shortage
exists for specific purposes adjacent to large towns. The land, suitable for housing the people employed
in a given industrial area, is limited if it is considered in relation to the time it is reasonable to spend in
travel to and from work. Although it can be shown that, to some extent, the problems of Great Britain
are different from those of Australia, the conclusions of the Barlow Commission and the Uthwatt and
Scott Committees are of interest. The Barlow Commission’s and the Scott Committee’s reports both
emphasise the importance of planning and control of land. The Uthwatt Committee also assumes :
“. . . That national planning is intended to be a reality and . . . that it will be directed to
ensuring that the best use is made of land with a view to securing economic efficiency for the community
and well-being for the individual, and that it will be recognised that this involves the subordination
to the public good of the personal interests and wishes of landowners. Unreserved acceptance of
this conception of planning is vital to a successful reconstruction policy, for every aspect of a nation’s
activity is ultimately dependent on land . . .” (Paragraph 17.)
297. We have already recommended the establishment of a Central Planning Authority (see
paragraph 200), as is also recommended by these bodies. Planning through a central planning authority,
as envisaged by these bodies, can take place without any change in the tenure of the land. Plans for
the development pf a residential ar§a can be given legislative force as recommended in paragraphs 181-183*


298. Should the present system of land tenure be changed to perpetual leasehold, the method
of control of land use also would require modification. We consider that this control is essential, whether
it is administered by giving legislative force to plans for town development, or by inserting in each perpetual
lease title provisions which would restrict the use of the land held under this title to specific approved
purposes, and which would subject the holders to compliance with town planning legislation.
C. LIMITATION OF PRIVATE PROFITS FROM LAND.
(a) General.
299. Land has a market price only in association with the people who reside in the area where
it is situate and in adjacent areas. We have been impressed by the burden on the community, due to
prices of land being forced up by speculative holders who obtain tribute from genuine purchasers of land
for home building, and, in addition, to increased prices due to various factors which are attributable
mostly to the community as a whole. Some of the disadvantages to the community of these high prices
are :
(1) high prices have contributed to placing the ownership of land beyond the reach of many
of the people;
(2) private owners of land have enjoyed an unearned increment from a national asset;
(3) premature subdivisions (made for profits) have surrounded large towns with the result
that farm land has been forced out of use, and the community has been burdened by the
additional expense of providing public utilities for land not yet required for development ;
and
(4) in some cases land which is required for the development of an area has been held out of
use in the hope of greater profit.
(b) Need for a Uniform System of Valuation by Government Authorities.
300. Before any attempt can be made to restrict profiteering in land, a generally accepted system
of valuing land is necessary.
301. The establishment of a statutory valuing authority in each State is, in our opinion, necessary
to secure uniformity of valuations which, except in New South Wales, where a Valuer-General’s
Department was set up under the Valuation of Land Act, 1916, are now effected by a multiplicity of
government and local government authorities and persons, resulting in many anomalies. We have very
emphatic evidence hereon from Mr. H, C. Valentine, A.5.M.8., Chief Valuer, State Rivers and Water
Supply Commission of Victoria, who stated :
“The present position of land valuations in Victoria is chaotic. One parcel of land may be
valued differently for Federal Land Tax, State Land Tax, Water Supply Rating, Municipal Rating,
Probate, Selling Value, Mortgage Value and Land Compensation . . .”
“ A Central Valuation Authority would eliminate present confusion, overlapping and
duplication of services and reduce the cost of valuing, which has, ultimately, to be met by the
taxpayer . . .”
“ It would discourage speculation in land and so avoid false values.”
“ A Central Valuation Department has been established in New South Wales, New Zealand
and Denmark.”
302. Much evidence in the same strain has been given to the Commission by witnesses in various
parts of the Commonwealth. We are satisfied that a statutory valuing authority is a long overdue reform,
and, further, its establishment will facilitate the control of land prices and the assessment of compensation
for acquisition of land. Accordingly, WE RECOMMEND that a conference be held with the States with
a view to establishing a statutory valuing authority that will pursue a uniform policy of valuation by
adopting and using the same basic principles. This authority may be a Commonwealth body with a
deputy in each State or a department of the Commonwealth and of each State, required by law to function
in conformity with valuing principles agreed upon from time to time between the Commonwealth and the
States. Valuations should be made by the authority quinquennially, and they should be accepted for all
government, local government and trustee investment purposes, and be available to the public generally.
303. Among the responsibilities of this authority would be to value as soon as possible all urban
land and land situate in proclaimed “ housing development areas ” within the Commonwealth (see
paragraphs 181 , 182). This would facilitate any plans for the assessment of rents of land held on perpetual
lease or for the taxation of increases in land values (see paragraphs 306-319).
304. In order to assist in keeping market prices of land near the level of the valuing authority’s
valuation thereof, we consider that it should be compulsory for such authority’s valuation to be quoted
in every contract of sale of land, and in every advertisement of land for sale—this is in accordance with
the opinion of the Rural Reconstruction Commission.
305. Pending the establishment of a statutory valuing authority WE RECOMMEND that land
values should be pegged on the basis of values as at the 10th February, 1942, which is the date prescribed
by the National Security (Economic Organisation) Regulations, for the control of land sales.


(c) Land Nationalisation.
306. Our terms of reference do not require us to make an/ report on land nationalisation, but
the matter was so often referred to by witnesses, a large number of whom strongly advocated it, whilst
practically all were in agreement that there was no objection thereto had it been the land policy and
system from the inception of settlement in Australia, that we feel impelled to make some comnnent on
this very far-reaching and deep subject as a means to prevent land speculation, solve the problem of
compensation-betterment of the present system and provide a satisfactory basis on which post-war
reconstruction may more effectively proceed.
307 In considering the matter it is useful to record that the Uthwatt Committee (the most recent
English authority to comment on this subject) considers that land nationalisation is the only adequate
method of preserving for the people as a whole any increase in land values, and of removing some of the
difficulties of compensation for resumption of land ; but that Committee rejects nationalisation as a
practical measure in the following terms :
“ . . . We have no doubt that land nationalisation is not practicable as an immediate measure
and we reject it on that ground alone. We state our objections to its immediate practicability
shortly :
“ First : Land nationalisation is not a policy to be embarked upon lightly, and it would arouse
keen political controversy. A change of view upon the topic of land nationalisation calls
for more than a rearrangement of prejudices. Delay, to say the least, would result.
“ Second : It would involve financial operations which in the immediate post-war period might,
as we see the matter, be entirely out of the question.
“ Third : Land nationalisation would involve the establishment of a complicated administrative
machinery equipped to deal with the whole of the land of the country.” (Paragraph 47.)
308. This Commission is also of the opinion that the only satisfactory method of dealing with the
problems of land use and land values is for land to be nationalised, and held thereafter as leasehold ; we
feel, however, that the lease should be one in perpetuity with periodic reappraisements of the capital
value. We are not in agreement with the objections to nationalisation as stated by the Uthwatt
Committee. We realise that there are many difficulties to effect the conversion, but are of the opinion
that serious consideration should be given as to whether it is not possible for these to be equitably
overcome. Commenting on the objections of the Uthwatt Committee in order, we consider that :
First : political controversy and delay are not valid objections to a desirable policy;
Second : the size of the financial operations required should not daunt those used to wartime
finance ; and
Third : the necessity to build up a complicated administrative machinery should not be a
deterrent, particularly in view of wartime experience.
Note.—94 per cent, of the land in Queensland and all the land in the
Federal Capital are already held as leasehold tenure.
There would, of course, be considerable public opposition to land nationalisation, both from existing
land owners and from many who would fear that such may be a prelude to other similar measures ; but
it seems to us that land nationalisation is the only effective way to eliminate private profit-making from
land and to reserve to the community the unearned increment. A striking illustration of the loss to the
community and private gain to freeholders who acquired land in the early days of Australia is set out in
the following extract from an address by a past president of the Real Estate and Stock Institute (Victoria)
on early real estate in Melbourne, published in the Institute’s journal of April, 1944 :
44 At this sale (June, 1837) Lots 6,7, 8 and 9, having a frontage of 264 feet to the north side of
Collins Street by a depth of 315 feet along the west side of Swanston Street, back to Little Collins
Street, to which it had a frontage of 264 feet, were sold for £l4O .. . Certain areas have been sold
off. The most conspicuous of these sales was that to the M.U.1.0.0.F., who purchased the corner
of Collins and Swanston Streets (64 feet x 91 feet 2f in.) at the rate of £3,906 per foot to Collins
Street, in November, 1928. In round figures to-day, the original area, purchased for £l4O, represents
a vacant land value of £1,200,000 ! ”
This to a degree is typical of similar happenings in other large towns.
309. Moreover, if nationalisation be effected, the capital cost of housing to the individual occupant
would be reduced. At present the home purchaser, except chiefly in Queensland, Western Australia
and Australian Capital Territory, has to purchase the freehold of the land as well as the house erected
thereon ; further, in calculating the economic rent of a dwelling for rental, amortisation of the cost of
the freehold land is included. The need for government subsidies to housing would be reduced if the
land were leasehold. It has been claimed that there is a certain disadvantage in the leasehold title while
freehold title still exists, since the leasehold property may be less readily mortgaged or marketed ; this
disadvantage would cease to exist if all land were held as leasehold.
310. WE RECOMMEND that the Commonwealth Government set up a special committee to
investigate land nationalisation, with special reference to a basis for land valuation under nationalisation.
311. Set out in broad outline in Appendix VII are comments on a method of land nationalisation.


312. Irrespective of whether land nationalisation be effected, WE RECOMMEND that land
resumed by the government for development purposes should be disposed of on perpetual lease tenure
and not by sale as a freehold.
(d) Betterment Tax.
313. There are many definitions of the term betterment ” contained in dictionaries and political
economy treatises, but for our purposes no definition could be better than that adopted by the Uthwatt
Committee (August, 1942) which gave considerable attention to the question, which definition reads:
To sum up, while the term betterment ’ is not specifically defined in any general Act, it
may now be taken, in its technical sense, to mean any increase in the value of land (including the
buildings thereon) arising from central or local government action, whether positive, e.g., by the
execution of public works or improvements, or negative, e.g., by the imposition of restrictions on
other land.” (Paragraph 260.)
The implementation of the large-scale housing programmes, including the planning of practically all our
cities and towns, envisaged by this report will cause the compensation-betterment problem to loom
largely in the operations of housing authorities, and, consequently, there must be a clear understanding
and appreciation of the position, and what effective means may be taken to see that post-war housing
is not impeded nor fettered by the high prices of land, and that any increase in the value of land arising
from the action of a public authority is recoverable either wholly or substantially by the authority. The
compensation-betterment problem has also exercised the minds of the Uthwatt Committee, which made
the following observation following paragraph 47 of their report quoted previously :
‘‘That conclusion makes it desirable to consider whether there is any method short of
immediate nationalisation, which will effectively solve the compensation-betterment problem of the
present system and provide an adequate basis on which post-war reconstruction will be able to
proceed.” (Paragraph 48.)
314. It has been suggested to the Commission that the government should impose an increment
(betterment) tax designed to reserve to the Crown a substantial part of the unearned increment in land
values and be calculated on the quinquennial valuations of the statutory valuing authority recommended
in paragraph 302, and that this tax should be a percentage of the increment in site value over the datum
line valuation at each quinquennial valuation period, which valuation should be based upon the unimproved
site value as at 10th February, 1942, to be paid to the Crown on transfer by sale. Where the land is not
sold, a charge of 3 per cent, per annum on a percentage of this increment should be paid annually to the
Crown.
315. We are generally in agreement with the principle of an increment (betterment) tax, and
are of the opinion that the tax should be 75 per cent, of the increment in the site value over the datum
line valuation, but, as we are somewhat uncertain as to implications that may arise from it, we feel that
the matter should be the subject of a special investigation by a committee of experts. Accordingly,
WE RECOMMEND the matter of an increment (betterment) tax be also included in the terms of reference
of the special committee recommended to inquire into land nationalisation (see paragraph 310) to be
imposed either as an interim measure prior to land nationalisation or as an alternative thereto.
316. A betterment tax on a similar principle, but levied on the increase of the annual site value
over the datum annual site value, has been recommended by the Uthwatt Committee (see the Committee’s
report, paragraphs 308-347).
317. There is undoubtedly room for difference of opinion as to the actual proportion of the
increment in site value, which should be taken by the tax, but we have considered a number of proposals
and regard the rate of 75 per cent, as fair and reasonable. We also regard the charge of 3 per cent, per
annum until the land is transferred as reasonable, as it approximates the present effective rate on
Commonwealth Government securities. In effect the institution of an increment (betterment) tax on
the basis suggested means that the Crown acquires an equity equal ultimately to 75 per cent, of the
increment on the quinquennial site value over the datum site value, and that in the absence of transfer
the landholder is charged at that price for the use or retention of that accretion over quinquennial periods
318. Assuming the introduction of an increment tax in accordance with the foregoing points, an
important problem will be the present varying land tax systems. There should be in this Commission’s
opinion, some attempt to institute a uniform system of State land taxation to dovetail into the Common-
wealth land tax, and local government taxation.
319. In this regard, one suggestion put before the Commission which it considers worth recording
was that:
“ (I) all assessments on property existing at 10th February, 1942, whether for Commonwealth,
State or local government purposes, shall be the ceiling of assessments for those purposes;
(2) all unearned increment that is established after that date shall be liable to an increment tax
as specified above;
(3) the income received from this tax in each State might be distributed as follows : ’
one-third to Commonwealth revenue ;
one-third to each State ; and
one-third to each local government authority, pro rata , of the population;


(A) the money so distributed to be ear-marked for the assistance of development, inclusive of
housing;
(5) to establish the datum line of valuation, where there is a variation in the figures for the
three taxing authorities, the highest value or standard of value as assessed shall be adopted ;
and
(6) to prevent spectacular rises in land prices a provision could be made limiting the increment
to 5 per cent, per annum as from the start of each quinquennial period.”
(e) Other Proposals.
320. The main proposals which have come under the notice of the Commission, additional to
those already discussed in Part V and earlier sections of this Part, are listed below :
(1) All ‘‘development rights ” in land be reserved to the Crown from a definite date.
Landowners would be required to lodge a claim within a limited period and no
subsequent claim would be recognised.
After investigation, the agreed value of development rights would be recorded upon
the title but no compensation would be paid unless and until the land was resumed.
(2) Landowners might be requested to value their own land, the same valuation to be accepted
for the purposes of taxation or compensation if the land be resumed.
(3) When Crown lands are sold a restriction be placed on the period within which they may
be resold.
(4) All local government rates be calculated on the basis of the unimproved capital value,
rather than on the annual rental value.
(5) A special rate be imposed, say double the prescribed rate, where the land has not been
used for a period of, say, five years from the date of ownership, such to be operative within
two years of the date of proclamation of the proposal.
Provision would be made for relief from the additional tax in cases of hardship and,
also, for the surrender of the land to the local government authority or to the Crown.
(6) No person to hold more than one block of residential land, subject to modification in
particular cases, for example, public companies.
321. All these proposals are suggestions to restrict speculation in land ; considered singly, many
of them have some merit ; they are all, however, only partial remedies.
322. It seems, in all the circumstances, that the whole problem of limitation of private profit
from land could best be met by a policy of land nationalisation, and failing that by an increment
(betterment) tax. Once either of these measures is introduced, the proposals listed above would
become of little or no value. It is better to meet the problem as a whole than to treat each part separately.
D. ACQUISITION OF LAND FOR HOUSING PURPOSES.
323. Discussions with representatives of State Government departments and housing authorities
have revealed difficulties in present methods of resuming land for public purposes, inclusive of housing.
In general, land is either bought on the open market or is acquired by negotiation. Negotiation tends to
be prolonged and prices are often unduly inflated. Where resumption is used, the progress of the housing
projects may be held up by litigation regarding the amount of compensation and, in some cases, by the
need to serve notice of resumption on absentee owners.
324. It is undesirable for development in the interests of the community to be checked by
particular individuals ; it should be impossible for individuals to retard development by refusal to sell.
Some of the existing difficulties would be obviated by the proclamation of “ housing development areas ”
as recommended in paragraphs 181, 182. Therefore, WE RECOMMEND the following provisions be
made in respect of acquisition of land for housing purposes, that :
(a) the relevant departments or authorities should be given absolute right to resume or acquire
land for specific housing purposes ;
(b) compensation for resumption or acquisition should be based on the valuation of the statutory
valuing authority (see paragraphs 300-305) ;
(c) the owner or other interested party should have the right to appeal against the compensation
proposed to an authority composed of persons experienced in the valuation of land, and
each party should bear its own costs ;
(d) the resuming authority should have the right at any time before the acceptance
of compensation, to cancel the resumption upon payment of costs incurred ; and
(e) the title of land resumed or acquired should pass to the authority immediately after the
publication of the notice in the Government Gazette.
325. We consider that these proposals should be discussed by a conference with representatives
of the States with the object of having State legislation and procedure as uniform as possible.


E. NEED FOR IMMEDIATE ACQUISITION OF LAND FOR HOUSING.
326. Whatever policy is adopted by the Commonwealth Government in respect of land, there
is need for immediate steps to be taken to acquire land in preparation for post-war housing. We regard
it as a matter of major importance that, as far as possible, detailed preparations (in accordance with town-
planning principles) should be made now for the location and preparation of sites. Therefore, WE
RECOMMEND that, as soon as practicable, the States should be invited to confer with the Commonwealth
with respect to:
(1) total quantity of building land already held by State Housing Authorities, and its location
in general terms ;
(2) proportion of land in (I) which is subdivided and provided with public utilities so that
building may be commenced immediately ;
(3) any extension of the powers of State Housing Authorities necessary to enable them to
acquire or reserve the land needed ;
(4) finance required if additional land is to be acquired immediately ; and
(5) manpower, especially technical staff, and materials required by State authorities in order
to prepare the land for building by subdividing and providing necessary public utilities.
327. On the basis of the information obtained from the States, after conferring as suggested in
paragraph 326, WE RECOMMEND that the State authorities be given whatever assistance is deemed
necessary to enable them, with due regard to town-planning principles, to acquire and prepare sufficient
land for the housing programme approved for the first post-war year.
328. In this connection, it is interesting to note that the British Government has impressed upon
local government authorities the urgency of acquiring land for post-war development, including housing.

F. Number of dwellings of different sizes and types.
G. Number of dwellings to be built on new estates and number on existing subdivisions.
A. SIZE OF PROJECTED HOUSI NG] PROGRAMMES.
329. In Part IV we set out the reasons why we considered it necessary for the Commonwealth
Government to assume responsibility for ensuring that there will be, in the future, a good standard of
housing at a reasonable cost for all the people of Australia. WE RECOMMEND that Commonwealth
responsibility should take the form of sponsoring:
(a) housing programme, to be undertaken as soon as war conditions and available building
resources permit, in order to afford some immediate relief of the acute housing shortage
(Immediate Relief Programme);
(b) large-scale housing programme to be undertaken immediately the war ends (Immediate
Post-War Programme) ; and
(c) long-term programme and a permanent housing plan to prevent a recurrence of the present
housing conditions (Long-Term Programme and a Permanent Housing Plan).
(a) Immediate Relief Programme.
330. The number of dwelling units, which can be built during the war period will be limited by
the building resources and by the technical staffs of housing authorities. Nevertheless, we stress the
importance of building being increased as soon as war conditions permit. The immediate relief programme
will assist the organisation of the building industry in preparation for post-war dwelling construction.
331. A Commonwealth inter-departmental committee has already approved an initial building
programme of 1,215 houses for the period ending June, 1944, and 1,500 houses for the third quarter of
1944. The Commonwealth administration is being carried out by the War Housing Division of the
Commonwealth Department of Labour and National Service, but the planning, erection and subsequent
administration of the dwellings are the responsibility of the housing authority in each State and of the
Department of the Interior in the Australian Capital Territory. The building of these dwellings has
not proceeded as rapidly as was hoped, and has revealed difficulties of building under war conditions.
(b) Immediate Post-War Programme.
332. The size of the immediate post-war housing programme will be determined by the resources
available, and the continuance of some wartime controls (see paragraphs 141-143).
333. Despite the lack of detailed information on the number of homes required, there is no need
to delay plans for post-war building. It can safely be assumed that, during the first few years after the
war, building will be concentrated in the areas where the need is greatest. The estimates available make
it clear that limited resources will render it difficult to over-build in the areas of most acute shortage.
By the time the immediate post-war period is past, detailed surveys should provide a reliable basis for
further building.


334. Assuming that there will be a sufficient period before the war ends for preparations to be
made, we consider that the target should be 50,000 dwelling units completed, or under construction,
by the end of the first post-war year. In addition, provision should be made for essential and urgent
repairs to buildings, so as to prevent further serious deterioration of national assets. Within three
years of the end of the war, the building programme should be increased to 80,000 dwelling units per
annum. This target of 50,000 dwelling units compares with 30,000 dwelling units per annum recorded
as erected in the pre-war peak building period of 1938-40 ; including an estimate of unrecorded building,
it is probable that at least 40,000 dwelling units per annum were constructed during that period.
335. Whether it is possible to reach the target of 50,000 dwelling units by the end of the first
post-war year will depend upon the availability of resources, the organisation of the building industry,
and on the continuance of some wartime controls.
336. During this period, the erection of new dwelling units should in general take precedence
over the replacement of sub-standard housing and slum clearance, except in distressful cases requiring
immediate attention. Large-scale slum clearance should not be carried out until the housing shortage
has been substantially relieved. In the meantime, however, all preparatory work for slum clearance
should be undertaken to avoid any unnecessary delay. A detailed discussion of slum clearance is contained
in Part XV.
(c) Long-Term Programme and a Permanent Housing Plan.
337. We consider that the building rate of 80,000 dwelling units per annum should be maintained
until the greatest part of the housing shortage has been removed, sub-standard dwellings either modernised
or replaced and slum clearance well in hand. The aim should be to reach this position within ten years
of the cessation of hostilities, and then to taper off the programme until it covers only normal increase
in demand and the replacement of obsolete dwellings ; this rate of residential building can be expected
to be considerably above the pre-war rate.
338. I ncreases over the pre-war residential building rate will be needed to cover the normal
increase in population and any immigration, and, also, the replacement of obsolete dwellings which has
never been extensive. If this is to be undertaken as part of a normal housing programme, the rate of
building will need to be further increased above the pre-war level. In addition, any slackening in building
created by relief of the housing shortage can be expected to be taken up by an expansion of other types
of building which have been restricted so as to give priority to housing.
(d) Recommendation.
339. WE RECOMMEND that the post-war housing programmes should cover the numbers of
new dwelling units stated below, in addition to essential and urgent repairs to existing dwellings :
(1) the size of any immediate relief programme undertaken must depend entirely on the
building resources available, but should be as large as war needs permit;
(2) in the immediate post-war programme the target should be the erection of 50,000 dwelling
units by the end of the first post-war year, extending by the third post-war year to 80,000
dwelling units per annum ; and
(3) this should be followed by a long-term programme and a permanent housing plan of 80,000
dwelling units per annum maintained until the greater part of the housing shortage has
been removed, sub-standard dwellings modernised or replaced and slum clearance well
in hand.
B. PROPORTION OF HOUSING PROGRAMME TO BE UNDERTAKEN BY
GOVERNMENT AGENCIES.
(a) General Considerations.
340. No rigid recommendation can be made at this stage on the proportion of the housing
programmes to be undertaken by government agencies and by private enterprise, including semi-
government agencies. It is, however, clearly necessary to reach some conclusion, and in doing so, we have
made the following assumptions :
(1) in the immediate post-war period, government agencies may be able to expand their
building more rapidly than private enterprise, because they will have been in a better position
to build up their organisation under war conditions;
(2) private enterprise is unlikely to be able to build soon after the war at a higher rate than
it did during the pre-war building peak of 1938-40, and at the same time, undertake building
by contract for government agencies ; and
(3) government agencies must retain a substantial proportion of the total programme because
private enterprise cannot be expected to provide adequately for the low wage earner or
to effect slum clearance.
( b) Immediate' Relief Programme.
341. Government-financed housing might comprise half of the total dwelling units to be erected
during this period, e.g., if there is sufficient resources available for the erection of 40,000 dwelling units,
20,000 of them might be erected by government agencies. In the initial stages, while the programme is
small, however, it is desirable for most of the building to be undertaken through government agencies,
as this facilitates economies of construction and the allocation of dwellings to the areas of greatest need.


(c) Immediate Post-War Programme.
342. Government-financed housing might comprise three-fifths of the total dwelling units erected
during the first post-war year, 30,000 out of 50,000 dwelling units, and rise by the end of the third post-
war year to 40,000 dwelling units out of a total of 80,000.
(d) Long-Term Programme and Permanent Housing Plan.
343. Government-financed housing during this period should be maintained at a total of about
40,000 dwelling units a year, out of a total programme of 80,000 dwelling units per annum. Private
interests would thus be responsible for not less than the level of pre-war dwelling construction during
the peak period of 1938-40, in addition to building undertaken on behalf of government agencies.
344. The numbers of dwelling units quoted under (b), (c) and (d) are in addition to normal repairs
to dwelling units and to repairs which have been postponed during wartime restrictions. This section
of the building programme will also be considerably greater than the pre-war level.
345. The numbers of government-financed dwelling units suggested above may have to be revised
after further information is available. In particular, the plans for replacing or modernising sub-standard
dwellings, and for slum clearance, may indicate that the government share of the building programme
must be largely increased.
C. DISTRIBUTION OF HOUSING BETWEEN STATES.
346. The preliminary housing surveys, which are being made in each State, should be of assistance
in determining the distribution of the housrng programme between States, and should be of value in
allocating the housing programme to different areas within each State. The methods of collecting the
information differed widely between States, and the results cannot be regarded as comparable ; also
peacetime conditions can be expected to cause population shifts between States and between different
areas within States.
347. Despite these difficulties it is necessary to base detailed planning on some assumptions in
this regard.
348. In the absence of a detailed survey of housing needs, it is impossible to recommend a logical
distribution of housing programmes between States and between different areas within each State.
Therefore, WE RECOMMEND that pending a detailed housing survey, the following procedure should
be adopted for distribution of housing between States :
(a) the number of dwelling units to be built should first be allocated between the States
proportionately to pre-war population ; and
( b) the allocation between States should then be modified, according to the availability of
resources and the urgency of need, as disclosed by the preliminary housing survey (paragraph
131).
349. When the results of the surveys recommended in Part 111 are available, the basis of allocation
should be reviewed and determined, according to needs as disclosed thereby. A table is set out below
showing the recommended percentage of new dwelling units to be erected in each State. This table
has been based on the population figures as disclosed by the census of 1933, adjusted to give estimates
for 1940
State.

D. PROPORTION OF GOVERNMENT-FINANCED HOUSING FOR RENTAL
AND OWNERSHIP.
(a) Immediate Relief Programme.
(I) Dwellings for Rental.
350. In paragraphs 390-398 we recommend the setting up of State Housing Authorities with
specific powers; until these authorities have been established WE RECOMMEND that existing
Government housing authorities should undertake building during the immediate relief period and
should build a large number of dwellings for rental.
*92130—D


351. During this period the erection of government-financed houses for rental should be
preferred for the following reasons :
(i) it will secure economies by large-scale construction;
(ii) it will be easier to direct relief to the areas of greatest need;
(iii) there are certain to be large shifts of population in the immediate post-war period, and
on that account it is undesirable at that stage to encourage home ownership which may
become a drag on the purchaser ; and
(iv) as building costs in the early post-war years will be abnormally high (with a decrease more
than probable) persons on low incomes should be encouraged to rent rather than enter
into home purchase contracts.
(2) Dwellings for Ownership.
352. WE RECOMMEND that permits should be given during the immediate relief period for
the construction of a limited number of dwellings for ownership. These permits should first be allocated
to areas of the greatest housing shortage and then allotted to individual applicants according to the
priority scale suggested in paragraphs 485, 486.
( b) Immediate Post-War Programme.
353. During this period, there should be provision for government-financed housing for both
rental and ownership. It is difficult at this stage to name any definite proportion. It is clear that a large
number of Australians wish to own their homes. It is, however, equally clear that there is a section
of the community, including those in casual or seasonal occupations, pensioners and single persons, and
those subject to transfer, such as railway workers, bank and insurance clerks, public servants, etc., who
may prefer rented dwellings. Private enterprise has not provided adequately for them in the past and
government housing is necessary to satisfy their needs. We suggest that during this period subject to
modifications in particular areas, half the government-financed housing programme should be provided
for rental and half for purchase. This proportion can be adjusted as experience indicates.
(c) Long-Term Programme and a Permanent Housing Plan.
354. By the conclusion of the immediate post-war programme, there should be sufficient
experience of the needs of the people to provide a reasonable basis for dividing the government-financed
housing programmes between rental and purchase. There will still be need to build different proportions
in different areas, and provision should be made for frequent revision of these proportions/
355. There is a possibility that, as the benefits of a government housing programme become
apparent, more people may desire to rent and fewer to purchase. The main advantages to be derived
from home purchase are security of tenure and ultimate home ownership, while the main advantages to
be gained from renting government-financed dwellings are both security of tenure and a lower weekly
payment for rent than for purchase. Renting makes it possible to change the dwelling occupied to suit
the changing needs of a family both in respect of size and location.
E. PROPORTION OF HOUSING PROGRAMMES TO BE ERECTED ON RURAL
PROPERTIES.
356. In the main, State Housing Authorities will need to decide what proportion of the housing
programme will be erected on rural properties in any period. While there is a shortage of building
resources, these will be most usefully employed, from the point of view of the community as a whole, in
building dwellings where advantage can be taken of mass production methods ; it will be necessary,
however, in the allocation of the programme, to make provision for certain classes of urgent building on
rural properties.
357. In closer settlement schemes, it will obviously be necessary to ensure that a dwelling is
provided on each farm area allotted ; as such schemes will, in most cases, be sponsored by Commonwealth
or State government authorities, it will be comparatively easy to arrive at the number of dwellings
required.
358. In addition to dwellings, which will be needed on newly-allotted areas, we have been greatly
impressed by the need to improve the standard of much rural housing (see Part XIV).
359. In view of the foregoing WE RECOMMEND that a high priority in allotment of dwellings
in the housing programme should be given to those on rural properties, who have no dwellings or are
living in sub-standard dwellings ; detailed surveys should be of considerable assistance in arriving at the
number needed.
360. Appendix VIII includes a table showing a suggested distribution of the housing programme
of the first post-war year between the metropolis and the remainder of each State ; this might be treated
as a first estimate until later information is available from surveys.
F. NUMBER OF DWELLINGS OF DIFFERENT SIZES AND TYPES.
361. It is impossible to make an accurate estimate of the number of dwellings of different sizes
and types, which will be required in any of the periods of the projected housing programmes. Information
is available on the proportion of the population composed of families of different sizes ; this is, however,
of little assistance, since it is recommended that during the early post-war period, preference in the
allocation of houses should be given to specific groups within the population. Thus any assumed
distribution of dwelling types used for the immediate post-war housing programme will need to be
periodically revised.


362. We suggest that the immediate post-war housing programme should be planned on the
assumption that an equal number of two and three-bedroom dwellings will be required, and that
a proportion of the three-bedroom dwellings should be supplied with additional accommodation in the
form of sleep-out verandahs. This assumption may need early revision in view of the preference in
allocation to large families. Applications for occupancy of government-financed dwellings will be nnade
to the State Housing Authorities. An analysis of the requirements of these applicants will form a basis
for a re-allocation of the housing programme between different sizes and types of dwellings.
363. In planning each housing estate, provision should be made for different-sized dwelling units.
We consider that, even in the early post-war period, the housing programme should not be confined to
single-unit dwellings, and that each large housing estate should provide at least sites for attached and
multi-storey dwellings (see paragraph 703). Unless there is some special reason, we consider that some
multi-storey dwellings should be built early in the post-war period, because they will use slightly different
building resources from other dwellings, and in some cases use a smaller amount of building resources for
each dwelling unit. Sites should also be allotted for hostels, which will be available for single persons
and students, but buildings for this purpose should not, in general, be given a high priority.
G. NUMBER OF DWELLINGS TO BE BUILT ON NEW ESTATES AND NUMBER
ON EXISTING SUBDIVISIONS.
364. The State Housing Authority will need to decide the number of dwellings to be built on new
estates and the number on existing subdivisions, and the position will vary as between different areas.
As far as possible, any decision made should be formed in the light of plans for the future of the area
concerned. The need for economy in building construction, and rapidity in the erection of dwellings
calls for the use of new estates, as far as possible, in the immediate post-war period. As a general principle,
on the other hand, economy could be effected by using, as far as possible, existing subdivisions already
supplied with all or some public utilities.

A. HOUSING FUNCTIONS OF THE COMMONWEALTH AND STATE
GOVERNMENTS.
(a) Relations between the Commonwealth and the States.
365. The responsibility of the Commonwealth Government with respect to housing and its
relation to the States are very important features of post-war housing plans, and, accordingly, we propose
to state our views thereon and what we consider should be the housing functions of Commonwealth and
State Governments.
366. Broadly, we consider that there should be a Commonwealth Minister to control and direct
housing policy of the Commonwealth ; whether he be charged solely with the administration of housing
policy, or be also charged with national planning and development, is a matter for government decision.
Whatever be decided, we are of the opinion that the Commonwealth Government’s policy in respect of
housing should be implemented by a Minister through a Commonwealth Housing Authority, which
should have a close relation to a Commonwealth Planning Authority, if it not be an integral part of such
authority (see paragraphs 200-203) so as to achieve the greatest co-ordination possible of national planning
and housing development.
367. So far as Commonwealth-State relations are concerned, two problems of significance arise,
namely :
(1) the measures to ensure that States will have the opportunity to participate in the
determination of policy ; and
(2) the arrangements to be made for the division of administration between Commonwealth
and State administrative departments and bodies.
368. In regard to (I), the present channel for Commonwealth-State discussions on policy matters
passes between the Prime Minister’s Department and the several State Premiers’ Departments, and
discussions are held at “ Premiers’ Conferences.” It will be essential to ensure that the States are kept
fully informed of the Commonwealth’s intentions, and that adequate provision is made for active
participation by the States in policy discussions prior to determination. Another body established for
Commonwealth-State discussion of and agreement in policy is the Loan Council, set up in 1927 to co-
ordinate public borrowings of the Commonwealth and the States. The Council considers the borrowing
programmes proposed by the Commonwealth and each State, and reaches agreement on any necessary
adjustment of these programmes in the light of the capacity of the loan market and any other relevant
factors. It has been suggested that a combination of the functions of the Premiers’ Conference and the
Loan Council would provide a suitable machine for Commonwealth-State discussion and agreement on
national development policies and programmes, and their financial and other implications.
369. The Commission’s view in regard to (2) is that actual administration should be in the hands,
at the Commonwealth level, of a special body established for that purpose (see paragraph 372) and at
the State level, by the State Housing Authorities and other bodies qualified to handle the detailed work
involved.
370. The third problem which may arise concerns the uniform administration by the States of
policy determined at the Commonwealth level. This requires that the States should be obliged to
provide adequate machinery subject to certain conditions as to general policy and standards of
administration, etc., as agreed upon by the Commonwealth. It also requires that the implementation
of policy through this machinery should be obligatory on the States, once general Commonwealth-State
agreement is reached. Otherwise, uniform development on the general lines envisaged in determining
the particular programme would not be achieved.
( b ) Commonwealth Housing Authority.
371. As housing will be an important factor in post-war planning and reconstruction, inasmuch
that it will have a large bearing on the level of employment, the Commonwealth Housing Authority,
whilst having no powers to construct or administer housing projects but with supervisory and advisory
powers in respect of research, planning and policy suggestions, should co-ordinate all housing activities
in Australia, assist to dovetail them into the national plan of development, and, simultaneously, afford
assistance and advice in the carrying out of all housing through the Commonwealth and State bodies ;
in the Commonwealth field, it should do this through a constructing and administrative body appointed
for that purpose (see paragraph 379), and in the State field, through State Planning Authorities which
should regard housing as one of their general economic and social functions, while State Housing
Authorities, under the direction of a State Minister for Housing in respect of policy, should exercise
specific housing powers.
372. Accordingly, WE RECOMMEND that a Commonwealth Housing Authority be set up under
the control of a Minister, to administer housing policy as determined by the Commonwealth Government,
to recommend financial assistance to housing authorities for housing purposes and to co-ordinate all
housing activities in Australia.
373. We are of the opinion that the Commonwealth Housing Authority should be a permanent
body constituted of three full-time members, responsible to a Minister charged with the administration
of Commonwealth housing policy, and such members should have, each or collectively, experience and
knowledge of public administration, housing, architecture, town planning and community facilities.


374. In order to obtain the closest co-ordination of all housing authorities in the Commonwealth,
at both Commonwealth and State levels, we are of the opinion that there should be regular conferences
of all such bodies with the Commonwealth Housing Authority, possibly quarterly, so that the bodies
actively administering housing policy and constructing housing projects should maintain close contact
with the Commonwealth Housing Authority, and thus assist to effect uniform interpretation of housing
policy. b
375. The functions of the Commonwealth Housing Authority and a State Housing Authority are
elaborated hereafter, and their relationship is illustrated by a diagram in Appendix IX.
376. WE RECOMMEND that the main functions of the Commonwealth Housing Authority,
subject to ministerial control and direction, should be :
(1) in collaboration with the Commonwealth Planning Authority, to implement and co-ordinate
housing throughout the Commonwealth, including social welfare in relation to housing ;
(2) to receive, through the Commonwealth Planning Authority, the proposed housing
programmes of the Commonwealth and the States, and to recommend to the Commonwealth
Planning Authority the size of the annual housing programme and after approval by the
Commonwealth Planning Authority to allocate such programmes between the States ;
(3) to examine proposed housing projects, where Commonwealth financial assistance is desired,
to ensure that the plans comply with Commonwealth standards for town planning, community
facilities and housing ;
(4) if necessary, to consult the authorities of the Commonwealth or any State in connection
with any modification of its housing programme ;
(5) from a fund created for the purpose, to make loans, grants, and/or subsidies, on conditions
prescribed, to housing authorities for approved housing projects ;
(6) to control general standards for government-sponsored housing ;
(7) to prescribe general conditions for allocation of priorities and for the issue of permits in
respect of housing ;
(8) to supervise, through the Commonwealth Constructing Authority, and the State Housing
Authorities, the allocation of priorities for government-financed housing and the issue of
permits for private domestic building ;
(9) to make arrangements with appropriate authorities for the provision of the necessary
building materials and labour to carry out approved housing programmes ;
(10) to supervise the carrying out of the conditions attached to any financial assistance granted
by the Commonwealth, by check inspections of projects and/or buildings, and by check
audits ;
(I I) to initiate housing and social surveys and to collect and distribute statistics and information
on housing ;
(12) to assist housing authorities by making available the results of research and the advice of
technical officers ;
(13) to determine maximum dwelling unit costs for government-financed projects ;
(14) to promote general publicity for better housing ; and
(15) to delegate any of its powers.
(c) Administration of Commonwealth Housing Activities.
377. At present, the housing activities of the Commonwealth Government are undertaken by
different bodies. The Commonwealth War Service Homes Commission administers the War Service
Homes Act, 1918-41, under which discharged service personnel are assisted to obtain homes. Under
the provisions of the Commonwealth Housing Act, 1927-28 the Commonwealth Bank of Australia is
empowered to make loans to prescribed authorities for housing purposes. Wartime housing functions
are undertaken by the Commonwealth War Housing Trust, which is responsible to the Minister for
Labour and National Service, and to the War Housing Division which is a section of the Department of
Labour and National Service. The Department of War Organisation of Industry administers the issue
of permits for civil building (including housing) and the licensing of the production of certain building
materials. Tenancy regulations are administered by the Prices Branch of the Department of Trade and
Customs, and control of sales of land and dwellings is administered by the Commonwealth Treasury.
The Department of the Interior not only administers a home-purchase scheme for the Australian Capital
Territory, but also erects houses for letting or for sale to Commonwealth employees. Planning for
post-war housing is being undertaken by the Ministry of Post-War Reconstruction.
378. This multiplicity of housing authorities at the Commonwealth level is most confusing to the
general public ; even Commonwealth and State Government departments have not a full understanding
of the divisions and functions of these bodies. It is impossible to avoid some overlapping, and though
attempts have been made to keep the different bodies informed of the work of each other, this has not
been completely successful.
379. We feel that all the housing functions of the Commonwealth Government, conducted by
the designing and constructing bodies mentioned, should be operated by one body comparable in status
with that of a State Housing Authority in a State (see paragraphs 390-398) this body is referred to
herein as the Commonwealth Constructing Authority. This body would perform all the housing functions
at the Commonwealth level in the same manner as a State Housing Authority would do at the State level.
The question of the future operations of the War Service Homes Commission requires special consideration
and this is dealt with by us in the following paragraphs.


(d) War Service Homes Commission.
380. The future administration of the War Service Homes Commission has engaged the close
attention of this Commission. It has been strongly represented to us that the War. Service _ Homes
Commission should continue to function as in the past, except that the conditions of ehg'bility of applicants
be broadened to include those still on active service so as not to require such persons to wait for their
discharge before obtaining the benefits of the Act. There appears to us to be three ways in which the
administration of the Commission may be carried on :
(1) continue as at present;
(2) merge with the Commonwealth Constructing Authority ; or
(3) transfer administration to State Housing Authorities.
(1) Continue as at Present.
381 The chief point raised in evidence in favour of the continuance of the War Service Homes
Commission as at present was that the service personnel would feel that their interests would be more
sympathetically and better cared for.
382. Many hold that the conditions prevailing from this war are hardly comparable with those
of the last war. In this war, a large proportion of the working population has been mobilised tor war
purposes—many were declared essential workers and precluded from joining the services, while others
have been directed into particular occupations and have been moved away from their normal place o
residence without any opportunity of joining the services.
383. As the liberal terms and conditions of home purchase proposed in this report compare
favourably with those at present provided for in the War Service Homes Act, and are better inasmuch
that they provide for subsidy to meet high building costs, and, further, as provision is made for erection
of housing for letting, if necessary at sub-economic rents, which is not provided for in the War Service
Homes Act, service personnel would not be at a disadvantage if the recommendations in this report be
enacted and the present schemes be not continued.
(2) Merge with the Commonwealth Constructing Authority.
384. The incorporation of the War Service Homes Commission as a section of the Commonwealth
Constructing Authority proposed to control housing at the Commonwealth level would not operate
against the interests of applicants as regards benefits and control, but would enable all Commonwealth
housing operations to be centred in one body ; if considered advisable, such section could still be
controlled by the Commissioner of War Service Homes but the annual programme of housing under , e
War Service Homes Act proposed for each State would form part of the Commonwealth housing
programme and be submitted together with other works to the Commonwealth Planning Authority ;
it would, however, be necessary to notify each State Housing Authority the housing programme proposed
for that State so that the State Planning Authority could take same into consideration when determining
the programme for that State Housing Authority.
(3) Transfer of Administration to State Housing Authority.
385. The incorporation of the administration of the War Service Homes Act as a section of a
State Housing Authority would have many advantages, principal of which would be that it would avoid
duplication of machinery and effect economies of administration. It would, further, reduce the call on
technical staffs which will be in short supply in the post-war period.
386. There is nothing new in this as the business of the War Service Homes Commission in
Western Australia is at present being conducted by the Workers’ Homes Board, the State Housing
Authority, and, further, its business had been for a time conducted in South Australia by the State Bank
of South Australia, and in Victoria by the State Savings Bank of Victoria. Other States had been approached
to conduct the local business of the Commission but negotiations had not been successful.
387. Should future administration of the War Service Homes Act be transferred to State Housing
Authorities, arrangements could be made for a close liaison between each authority and the head office
of the Commission in the Federal Capital, if necessary by having an officer specially appointed to each
State Housing Authority for that purpose.
388. Whatever policy is decided upon, it should be definitely laid down that a certain percentage
of the houses erected by State Housing Authorities should be allocated to eligible persons under the
War Service Homes Act ; any concessions to service personnel could be made through the Department
of Repatriation.
389. It should be noted that in the early post-war perjod many service personnel will be uncertain
of their future place of residence and, therefore, may prefer renting. We are of the opinion that housing
for service personnel, whether for rental or purchase, should be interspersed with homes for the general
community and that grouping of service personnel in group estates should not be effected, as it is not
desirable to create sectional groups of the population.
(e) State Housing Authority.
390. We consider that the State Housing Authority should be a body corporate subject to
ministerial control in respect of policy and should bear the same relation to the State Planning Authority
as any other State department, e.g., the Department of Public Works ; it should also be subject to the
State Planning Authority for the approval of allocation of housing quotas and for general planning of
housing development.


391 ' The State Housing Authority should co-ordinate all housing activities within the State •
this means that, in addition to co-ordinating the housing activities of semi-government bodies, private
bodies and persons, the State Housing Authority will be responsible for the standard of dwellings erected
tor employees of State departments. 6
a 392 ' )*! u EC ,?I ME I ND that housin g in each State should be controlled by a State Housing
Authority, which should be the supreme body for housing in the State and be subject to the control and
direction of a Minister on matters of policy, and the objects, constitution and powers of such authority,
to be established by legislation, should, inter alia, be as follows :
Objects.
393. (I) To improve existing housing conditions ; and
(2) to provide adequate and suitable housing accommodation for persons of limited means,
and certain other persons not otherwise adequately housed.
Constitution.
394. A body corporate under the name of the State Housing Authority with perpetual succession
and a common seal, capable of suing and being sued ; having power to acquire, purchase, sell, lease and
hold lands, goods, chattels and other property for the purpose of housing and borrow moneys for such
purposes ; and to consist of five members, one of whom should be a permanent officer with experience
in public administration, preferably in housing, and act as chairman, and the other members should have
knowledge and experience of all or any of the following :
(1) housing problems and conditions:
(2) planning, constructional, financial and economic aspects of housing ; and
(3) social welfare in relation to housing.
Special Powers.
395. (I) To co-ordinate housing projects submitted by various housing bodies (inclusive of the
estimated needs of private persons) within the State, and forward recommendations
thereon to the State Planning Authority;
(2) to report from time to time to the State Planning Authority the progress made in
carrying out of the State housing programme;
(3) where necessary, to amend housing projects submitted as in (I) to agree with the policy
of the State Planning Authority or the Commonwealth Authorities;
(4) to undertake insurance for tenants, purchasers and borrowers against fire, flood,
tempest and other damage to property of such persons.
Note. —The collection of premiums for insurance simultaneously
with payments in respect of the house would be a convenience to the
occupants. It should be possible to carry on this service at a very low
administrative cost.
General Powers.
396. (I) to acquire land for housing projects, either compulsorily or by negotiation, and to
assess compensation in respect thereof;
(2) to replan or subdivide land for housing projects subject to town planning principles
and legislation, if any;
(3) to prescribe regulations, non-compliance with which shall render a dwelling undesirable
or unfit for human habitation;
(4) to effect slum clearance;
(5) to order repairs or demolition of sub-standard dwellings;
(6) to control rents of sub-standard dwellings or parts of dwellings, furnished or unfurnished;
(7) to control standards of new dwellings, community facilities, and, if necessary, principles
of town planning;
(8) to town plan (inclusive of zoning), where there is not adequate town planning legislation;
(9) to control, until there is adequate town-planning legislation, development of land for
housing, inclusive of;
(i) proclamation of housing development areas ; and
(ii) control of subdivision of land.
(10) to erect dwellings for rental and for purchase;
(11) to administer housing projects, including dwelling units erected;
(i) for letting, at economic and sub-economic rents ; and
(ii) for purchase.
(12) to make advances to assist;
(i) purchase or erection of dwellings ;
(ii) release of onerous mortgages ;
(iii) repair and/or improvement of dwellings ; and
(iv) purchase of furniture;
(13) to guarantee against loss approved institutions advancing for home-purchase;
(14) to erect, furnish, equip and control hostels;
(15) to construct and equip community facilities;
(16) to purchase, distribute and/or manufacture building materials and equipment.
(17) to issue building permits;
(18) to set apart or surrender land for gardens, parks, open spaces, recreation reserves
schools, shops, religious buildings and other approved purposes ; and
(19) to delegate any of its powers and functions to an approved local government authority
or any approved group of local government authorities, or to any approved body


397. These functions have been incorporated in the Model Housing Act included as Appendix VI.
It is not suggested that this Model Act should be adopted as a whole by any State, but that it should form
a basis for the preparation of a State Act or for amendments to existing State Acts.
398. The detailed organisation of a State Housing Authority will be a matter for each individual
State. We would, however, suggest that in addition to the powers which we have listed above
consideration should be given to the following :
(1) The setting up of an Advisory Committee for Site Selection as has been done by the
Victorian Housing Commission. This Committee 'should consist of representatives of
such bodies as the main roads board, transport board, water and sewerage board,
surveyor-general’s department, gas and electricity supply authorities.
(2) The determination of fair rents for dwelling units furnished and unfurnished, as done by
the South Australian Housing Trust under the South Australian Landlord and Tenant
Control of Rents) Act, 1942.
Note. —The Housing Authority with its expert knowledge and the
services at its command is, in our opinion, in a better position to determine
rents than any other authority.
(3) The establishment of an architectural and inspectorial section of the Housing Authority.
Note.—Although panels of architects may be employed by the Housing
Authority in an advisory capacity, we consider that a full-time architectural
and inspectorial staff should be employed so as to ensure satisfactory design-
ing, drafting of plans and specifications, and adequate supervision of the
erection of all buildings ; we are of the opinion that constant inspections
of dwellings should be made during the course of erection.
(f) Local Government Authorities.
399. In Part V we have stressed the need for planning to be undertaken by local government
authorities and the people themselves as well as by a central authority. We consider that, as far as
possible, administration of housing also should be decentralised as, in our opinion, there would be a
better development of housing by an increase in the powers of local government authorities.
(I) Construction and Administration of Government-financed Housing.
400. We realise that, in some States, local government authorities, as at present constituted, are
not capable of nor willing to undertake greatly increased functions. We consider, however, that there
is a sufficient number of such bodies anxious for an increase in authority to enable a beginning to be made
with the delegation of both planning and executive functions in relation to housing. These bodies will
require considerable assistance from technical staff employed by the Commonwealth and/or State
Housing Authorities. There will also need to be supervision of their administration by the State Housing
Authority to ensure that it is efficient.
401. In some cases, a particular local government authority may not have the resources necessary
to undertake housing projects, but it may be possible for it to combine with a number of other local
government authorities to form a county or regional council. This council may be formed to undertake
housing functions only or to undertake, in addition, other functions associated with regional development ;
this will apply to councils situate outside the metropolitan area. All housing, including slum clearance,
in a metropolitan area, should be the responsibility of the State Housing Authority, which would have
the power to delegate its powers to any one local government authority or group of local government
authorities in the metropolitan area, provided that the plans of such authority or group of authorities are
in conformity with the plan of the Housing Authority.
402. We are of the opinion that the time is now opportune for housing projects in Australia to
be undertaken by approved local government authorities either in groups or singly. It is for this reason
that we have recommended that one of the powers of the State Housing Authority should be the power
to delegate any of its powers or functions to other authorities as it deems advisable ; this should become
a special feature of the work of the Housing Authority, whose policy should be to delegate as many powers
as possible. There is a possibility that, if a central authority has been given wide powers, it may wish to
retain them. It is true also that in the early period the State Housing Authority may be more efficient
than the local government authority. We consider, however, that local government authorities should
be encouraged to extend their functions and that with reasonable assistance and guidance from the State
Housing Authority many of them should be capable of doing so within a comparatively short period.
403. We note here that we consider the total exemption from local rates claimed by certain
State Housing Authorities is generally inequitable, especially when the lands concerned have been built
on. The occupants of government-financed housing have the use of the utilities provided to the same
extent as other residents, and, therefore, rates should be payable. We are of the opinion that housing
authorities administering government-financed housing should not be liable to pay any rates imposed by
any State Act on any unoccupied property owned by it, but that rates should be paid where a dwelling
owned by it is let, or where any contract of sale, mortgage or other security under the Act administered
by the housing authority has been executed, provided that the housing authority shall not be liable to
pay any rates for which an occupier of property is primarily liable unless the authority to whom the rates
are payable satisfies the housing authority that it has made reasonable efforts to collect the rates from
the occupier and has not succeeded in doing so. We are further of the opinion that no property vested
in the housing authority should be let or sold by a local government authority to whom rates are payable
for non-payment thereof.


(2) Control of the Standard of Housing.
404. Local government authorities are generally empowered to require plans and specifications
for new buildings and alterations to existing buildings to be submitted for approval so that they comply
with their building by-laws, and, also, to order the repair or demolition of dwellings unfit for human
habitation. We consider that the power to approve the erection of new buildings should be made wider
and should involve the administration of a plan for the development of the area (see paragraph 195).
405. Regarding administration of the standard of existing dwellings, we consider that the present
administration should be strengthened. It should be made compulsory in all States for health and
building inspectors to have an approved training and be qualified before appointment. We have been
impressed from evidence submitted with the danger that exists of local pressure being exerted on the
health and the building inspectors. Therefore, WE RECOMMEND that health and building inspectors
as well as being required to undertake an approved technical training and be qualified, should be responsible
for the carrying out of their duties to the local government authority concerned, but power of dismissal
should rest with either the State Department of Health or the State Housing Authority. It should be
possible for the local government authority to request the dismissal or the transfer of an inspector, but
it should not be possible for him to be hindered nor influenced in the carrying out of his duties.
(g) Semi-Government Bodies, Building Societies, Friendly Societies, etc.
406. It is anticipated that a large part of the private enterprise section of the housing programme
will be carried out by semi-government and private institutions, which have been operating in this field.
It has been proposed by the Commonwealth Government that 20,000 dwellings should form the programme
to be carried out by those institutions during the first post-war year. Some of these institutions are
solely lending organisations, which make advances to individuals to enable them to build their own homes ;
others participate more directly in building and in supervision of the building operations ; others
actually undertake lending, planning and constructional functions. This field includes those bodies which
are guaranteed by governments, but which are not financed nor subject to direct control by the
government. These bodies have an important part to play in home purchase, since they may be expected
to build tens of thousands of houses annually. So far as possible, their policies should be co-ordinated
with that of State Housing Authorities ; there should be collaboration, not competition. Conditions
will vary from State to State, and in some States, the State Housing Authorities may be expected to play
a larger part than in others. It is the opinion of the Commission that the State Housing Authority is the
only body suitable for carrying out or supervising government-financed housing for rental and slum
clearance ; it will also carry out functions in respect of home purchase but in this field wherever possible
the services of State banks and other bodies should be used to the full ; these bodies, which include
building societies, friendly societies and other institutions, will have ample scope for their activities
outside the field of government-financed housing.
407. In order to enable these institutions to assist persons who are unable to finance the margin
of security usually required (especially those on the low range of income) to own their homes, WE
RECOMMEND that semi-government bodies, building societies, friendly societies, and other institutions
approved by governments, should be guaranteed by them against loss in respect of advances or contracts
of sale made to or executed by persons on a low-income range where such exceed a percentage of the
value of the property to be determined by the respective governments —for details of this recommendation
see Part XV of the Model Housing Act, Appendix VI.
408. It is probable that semi-government bodies will build more individual housing than State
Housing Authorities ; they will tend to build on scattered blocks more than in estates. Certain of the
devices recommended for estate building will not be open to them, but there are ways of cost saving
which could be employed. It should be the object of governments to encourage the use of such cost-
saving devices Amongst these are :
(1) Central Bureau for Architectural Services.
409. The Commission considers that steps should be taken to make available the services of
architects at reasonable cost. One step towards this would be the development of a central bureau for
architectural services, including both the drawing of plans and advice on building. This could be organised
in conjunction with the Housing Information Bureau recommended in paragraphs 420, 421. Substantial
improvement in quality and possibly some saving in cost may be achieved by the employment of architects,
and efforts should be made to encourage their use. The scope for such a service will vary with the type
of housing organisation.
410. There are two methods by which architectural services could be supplied ; these largely
supplement each other. The first is for the State Housing Authority to make available the services of its
technical section to non-government housing organisations and to private individuals. The other method
is to set up a special architectural panel for the purpose. We suggest that in each State the Institute of
Architects should be approached with a request that it should consider setting up such a panel on a basis
to be agreed. If plans and specifications were drafted sufficient in number to permit wide variety, and
conforming to Commonwealth standards of housing they could be adapted to site conditions. A reduced
architectural fee should be charged for service supplied by this panel.
(2) Inspectorial Services.
411. In our investigations, we have made special enquiries into the inspections of the erection
of dwellings that are made by the various bodies providing finance for home building ; where it is a State
authority that makes advances, reasonable methods of inspections are carried out, but, generally with


other bodies, the inspections are only for the purpose of ensuring the : security ! for the advance ; no
responsibility is recognised for any defects that may appear in the building. WE RECOMMEND that,
in all home building schemes, a complete inspection service be insisted upon, one that will give full
protection to the home builder or purchaser against wrong or unsatisfactory methods of construction
and/or use of inferior materials.
412. Local government authorities generally require that buildings be erected in accordance with
their by-laws, and, consequently, must make some inspections; it is, therefore suggested that the
inspectorial work of local government authorities should be expanded to cover all dwellings, which are
not erected under efficient supervision, such as is effected by housing authorities and architects.
Inspections could then be carried out in return for a small but commensurate fee for any home budder
to ensure that the dwelling is erected in accordance with the plan and specification, and to the standard
required by local government authority by-laws.
(3) Bulk Purchase of Materials and Components.
413. Well organised marketing of building materials and bulk buying may substantially lower
building costs and facilitate pre-fabrication, which depends on a large market. The value of bulk buying
will vary with the type of organisation carrying out the work. It may, however, be difficult in country
areas and with organisations building on scattered blocks to make good use of bulk purchasing, but the
experience of the Victorian Housing Commission and the South Australian Housing Trust is an indication
of the advantages to be gained from controlled use of such a method. The Victorian method is to avoid
the accumulation of stocks of materials with consequent risk of loss and expensive accounting systems,
by calling tenders from manufacturers for the delivery of materials direct on to the job as required.
(4) Building by the Authority.
414. There are two main ways of carrying out housing construction ; either the institution
making the loan supervises building operations or the individual receiving the loan arranges the details
himself. In the case of mass building in estates, the institution must make all the arrangements. It may
either employ contractors or undertake the work wholly or in part by day labour. Where erection is
on scattered blocks or where the whole operation is more individualistic in character, it has been customary
for the purchaser to employ a contractor to build him a house. Although mass techniques are not possible
in all cases, there are advantages in leaving all arrangements in the hands of the authority making the loan.
Individuals lack the experience necessary for supervising housing operations and contractors would often
benefit from the firmness and experience of an authority accustomed to carrying out housing operations,
in particular, such an organisation can avoid the pitfalls associated in choosing inefficient contractors.
415. Detailed comment on the relative merits of the contract and day labour systems is not
required here since either may be used by the housing authority. Objections have been made against
day labour. On the other hand, English local authorities have frequently found day labour quite
economical, and the Victorian Housing Commission has recently erected some houses by this method
with satisfactory results. It is probable that both methods will continue to be used.
(5) Reduction of Cost to Purchase a Home.
416. Many home purchasers are somewhat embarrassed at the costs, in addition to the deposit,
required to be paid in cash to purchase a home—they have little knowledge of the charges and fees
involved, and often find difficulty in financing them. Certain housing organisations and lending institutions
already provide legal services for a nominal or no charge, apart from out-of-pocket expenses. We
consider that, as far as possible, the cost involved in the purchase of a house, where the purchaser does
not already own a home, and requires it for personal use, should be reduced to a minimum and as much
as possible of the fees capitalised.
( h ) Terminating Co-operative Building Societies.
417. In several ways, the terminating co-operative building societies of the type operating in
New South Wales represent an advance and rather a novel feature in Australian housing ; their activities
have enabled numbers of persons to purchase or erect their homes who could not have otherwise done so.
The procedure to raise loans is that the State Government guarantees a society to a lending institution,
usually a bank or insurance company, for an advance up to 80 per cent, of the security, and, in certain cases
where loans, together with the member’s accumulated share capital, does not exceed £l,llO, and the
member agrees to personal occupation of the house andowns no other house, the State Government
further guarantees the member to the society should a member be advanced a sum in excess of 80 per
cent, of the security but not exceeding 90 per cent. Loans to members may be for 14, 21 or 28 years,
with interest at a notional rate of 5 per cent., plus a charge of 3d. per share per month to cover management
expenses, which is equivalent to Bs. 3d. per cent, over the period of a loan of 21 years. Interest on loan,
to the societies have varied from 5 per cent, in the early period to 3J per cent., as now fixed by the National
Security (Economic Organisation) Regulations—generally the interest rate was about the ruling trading
bank rate.
418. As terminating co-operating building societies will doubtlessly continue to play a part in
assisting home-purchase in New South Wales in post-war years, and as they may be established in other
States., we are of the opinion that their activities could, with advantage to members, be improved if the
following suggestions be adopted :
(I) Interest rates paid on loans from financial institutions be not in excess of a reasonable
percentage, say, one per cent, above that on long-term Commonwealth Government
securities.


(2) The notional interest rate to members be that charged by lending institutions or slightly
in excess thereof, plus the usual administrative charge. 6 '
Note. A charge slightly in excess of that charged by the institution
will enable a reserve to be created for losses.
(3) Societies be developed on a regional, possibly municipal, basis with one office and staff
centrally situate.
(4) Where a society is guaranteed by a government, a government nominee will sit regularly on
the board of such society. 6 1
(5) Societies accept full responsibility for the erection of a member’s dwelling strictly in accord
with the relative plan and specification, and for any defects arising within a reasonable
time after its completion.
(6) Societies be empowered to purchase land for home building for their members.
Note.— This would reduce cost of land to members by eliminating
developer’s profits and also selling charges.
(7) Societies be empowered to bulk purchase and distribute building materials for erection
of homes for their members.
Note.—lf a system similar to that adopted by the Victorian Housing
Commission (see paragraph 413) be followed, it would enable many
economies to be effected.
419. We also consider that, in view of the acute housing shortage, all future operations of these
societies should be restricted to the erection of new dwellings.
(/') Publicity.
420. In our visits to various parts of Australia, widespread lack of knowledge of what good
housing standards should imply has come prominently to our notice. Each local area has its own traditions,
and has in the past had little or no information on housing standards in other parts of Australia, or in
other parts of the world, which might suggest alterations to their own standards. We would not propose
that a new standard should be imposed on existing communities, but we are of the opinion that the
community, as a whole, should be educated in regard to desirable standards of housing, domestic equipment
and community facilities. We consider that this education should begin in the schools and be followed
through into adult education. It should cover a general knowledge of planning principles, of the difference
between a good design for a dwelling and a poor one, and of furnishing. Classes should be available on
home management and the care of a dwelling. This education policy should be carried out by lectures
and news-reels, by mobile housing exhibitions and by the establishment of Housing Information Bureaus,
as a part of the function of the Commonwealth and State Housing Authorities.
421. The Commonwealth Housing Information Bureau should be mainly concerned with collecting
information, issuing pamphlets and arranging for the production of news-reels. The State Housing
Information Bureaus might also undertake these functions, but, in addition, would be responsible for
direct contacts with the public. Their staff should answer enquiries and, possibly, supply lecturers for
areas where a demand was indicated. It should be possible for an intending home purchaser to visit
or write to one of these bureaus, and chat generally about his housing needs. Many homes are less well
adapted to the life of their occupants than they need have been, if only qualified advice had been available
when the original planning was undertaken. These bureaus should adapt their publicity to the needs of
particular areas ; in particular, the needs of country districts are usually different from urban districts.
B. ADMINISTRATIVE CONDITIONS TO WHICH HOUSING PROJECTS MUST
CONFORM.
(a) Approval for each Housing Project.
422. All proposals for housing projects initiated by local government authorities or other bodies
will be first submitted for approval to the State Housing Authority. A standardised form will be required
for this presentation to facilitate collation and report by the State Housing Authority. There will,
probably, be variations in the form used by different States, but each will need to show in detail the
location of the project, the type of construction proposed, its estimated cost, the amount required as
a loan or guarantee, any subsidy required, and the proposed terms .and conditions of advance or tenancy.
423. Alterations to a project may be suggested by the State Housing Authority. If and when
approved, the project will be forwarded together with plans initiated by the State Housing Authority
to the State Planning Authority for submission to the Commonwealth Authorities. If not approved by
the State Authorities, the local government authority or other body concerned should have the right
of appeal to the Commonwealth Authorities direct.
424. WE RECOMMEND that proposals for housing projects should not be approved by the
Commonwealth Housing Authority unless they comply with administrative conditions set out in Sections
(b) and (c) of this Part.
(b) Administration of Government-financed Dwellings for Rental.
425. In all rental projects, the economic rent should be assessed in accordance with the standard
formula scheduled in Appendix XIII. The rent charged shall not exceed the economic rent so calculated
without agreement by the Commonwealth Housing Authority. The authority may average, on an
equitable basis, the rent of all dwellings under its control. Where a Commonwealth subsidy is granted,
so as to bring the rent charged below the economic rent, the rent charged should be assessed in accordance
with conditions agreed by Commonwealth and State authorities.


426. The tenancy of any government-financed dwelling for rental should be subject to the
following conditions :
(1) no right to sublet or part witn possession as a whole;
(2) no right to sublet or part with possession of part, except with approval;
(3) no right to transfer the tenancy;
(4) the dwelling unit to be occupied only by the tenant, as a home for himself, his wife and
children, and for no other purpose, except that approval may be given, under exceptional
circumstances, for a relative or other person to occupy;
(5) tenancy to be on a weekly basis, terminable by a week’s notice by the State Housing
Authority or by the tenant, excepting that the State Housing Authority must not give
notice without cause. The spirit or the above provisions should be to provide the tenant
with as much security of tenure as possible, without restricting the Authority from operating
in the interests of the community as a whole, and, accordingly, the following are the causes
for which an Authority might serve notice on a tenant :
(i) tenant’s failure to comply with general conditions of occupancy providing for appropriate
use of the dwelling, good behaviour, etc.;
(ii) default in payment of the assessed rental on the due date;
(iii) increase or decrease of the accommodation needs of the tenant and his family;
(iv) location of dwelling in relation to zones, that might be declared under town planning
powers ; or
(v) in respect of the Authority’s administrative requirements.
Tenancy agreement should be on the basis of the Authority having no liability for
compensation for disturbance of occupancy, but the Authority, at its discretion, may make
an allowance in this regard ; and
(6) Option to Purchase.—Tenancy agreement to provide no right or option to purchase
the dwelling. Should the Authority desire to sell, however, the tenant should be given
the right of first refusal to purchase. This action should generally be inspired by the tenant s
desire to purchase, but should an Authority desire to sell in pursuance of causes referred
to in (5) (iv) or (v) above, the obligation would be with the Authority to provide alternative
accommodation.
(c) Administration of Government-financed Dwellings for Purchase.
427. It is probable that a large number of dwellings for purchase will be provided by semi-
government organisations and private bodies ; nevertheless, certain States may prefer the State Housing
Authority to cover a large part of this field, and proposals must be flexible enough to allow this.
428. Deposits and fees required for home purchase should be kept as low as possible. In some
cases, no deposit should be required, but the power to dispense with deposits should be discretionary
rather than mandatory. We would suggest that legal costs, stamp duty and certain fees be waived or
reduced ; these charges often prove embarrassing to the home purchaser. Included in Appendix Vis
a schedule showing the charges made by various government authorities throughout Australia. If it is
found impracticable to waive these charges, we consider that they should be added to the total loan so
that the purchaser should not be required to meet the payments initially in addition to any deposit
required.
429. We consider that very long purchase terms are inadvisable, and that in ordinary circumstances
a period of thirty years should be regarded as the maximum for all classes of dwellings.
430. We have given consideration to the reasons why home purchasers fall into arrears. We
consider that the reasons are almost always associated with unemployment or sickness. If the Common-
wealth Government succeeds in achieving a policy of full employment with comparatively high benefits
for transitory unemployment, financial difficulties due to this cause will become negligible. As regards
sickness, we feel that free health services should be readily available to all members of the community,
and that a reasonable measure of sick benefit should be payable during periods of incapacity. It is probable,
however, that even with comparatively high payments during any unavoidable periods of unemployment
or sickness, the home purchaser may find it difficult to meet payments on his home during these periods.
We, therefore, consider that if, during the term of purchase, the purchaser, from causes over which he
has no control, requires the funding of arrears and/or an extension of the term of purchase, it should be
permissible for such to be granted by the Housing Authority ; provision for this should be made in the
Housing Act of the State.
431. There are two main methods of sale, namely, contract of sale and sale on mortgage.
432. The majority of the Commission (see minority recommendation) is making no recommen-
dation on the maximum sale price nor the maximum advance, since these will be covered by the cost of
the types of dwellings of approved standard set out in Appendix X, Division (ii). We consider that the
maxima should be determined from time to time by the Commonwealth Housing Authority, in
collaboration with the State Housing Authorities.


433. Contract of Sale should be adopted as the method when the purchaser’s initial equity is
less than 10 per cent., but he should have the option of converting to a mortgage when he has built up an
equity of 10 per cent, or more. In addition to the general conditions, which usually apply to this method,
the following should be provided for :
(1) A deposit of not less than 5 per cent, of the cost or value of the dwelling and land be made
by each purchaser, excepting that, if warranted, by special circumstances, a less or no deposit
may be accepted;
Note. —Where the Authority buys the land and erects the dwelling
the percentage of deposit shall be assessed on the cost of the land and
dwelling. Where the Authority does not build the dwelling, the percentage
of deposit shall be assessed on the Authority’s valuation of the land and the
dwelling.
(2) the term of purchase should not exceed thirty years for all classes of construction;
(3) the rate of interest should not exceed the cost of money to the Housing Authority, plus
a percentage not exceeding I per cent, to cover operating expenses;
(4) payments, including interest and purchase money, to be calculated on a monthly basis,
but the Authority may agree to accept fortnightly or weekly payment to suit individual
needs;
(5) nominal penalty, not exceeding one penny in each pound, or part thereof, for each month,
or part thereof, to be imposed for failure to make payments within fourteen days of their
due dates;
(6) additional payments may be made at any time and be credited to a special account, on which
interest at the same rate as charged on the purchase account shall be allowed. From such
account, if sufficiently in credit, instalments of purchase money due may be paid at the
discretion of the Housing Authority, and the following payments at the request of the
purchaser :
(i) municipal rates;
(ii) water rates;
(iii) fire insurance premiums;
(iv) cost of renovations or additions or repairs ; or
(v) life insurance premiums.
If and when the balance of the special account equals the balance of the purchase account
the contract shall be deemed to have been fulfilled.
(7) any special conditions which may be laid down in the event of an approved re-sale (see
paragraphs 436-439) ; and
(8) restriction by law against transferring, letting, mortgaging, subdividing, etc., without the
Authority’s consent.
Note.—This must be implemented by a clause in the State Housing
Act, since it cannot be legally a clause in the agreement for sale.
434. For Sale on Mortgage the purchaser must be able to provide an initial equity of at least
10 per cent, of the Authority’s fair estimated value of the land and dwelling. In addition to the general
conditions which usually apply to this method of sale, the conditions (2) to (7) inclusive set out for a
contract of sale shall be provided for. The same terms and conditions would apply in respect of loans
secured by mortgage.
435. Consideration may be given to the provision of facilities for life insurance for the home
purchaser, so that if the purchaser should die before completing his contract the dwelling would
automatically become free of debt to his dependents. This could, of course, only be done where the
income of the home purchaser is sufficiently high for him to be able to afford the additional payment
without reducing his expenditure on other necessities. If the financial circumstances of the purchaser
preclude his taking out the full cover of his debt, a reduced cover commensurate with his circumstances
should be available, if desired by him.
436. Restriction on Sale of a Subsidised Dwelling. —ln order to prevent profit being made
from sale or resale of subsidised government housing, and to assist the housing authority to retain control
thereof, it is considered that any dwelling built under subsidy and sold to the occupant should be capable
of resale only to the government housing authority, which must at all times re-purchase if required.
However, where special circumstances warrant it, transfers may be approved by this authority.
437. The equity of the occupant would depend upon the original cost of the property to him,
his payments of the purchase price, value of permanent improvements effected to it by him, and its state
of repair ; obsolescence and depreciation would also be considered.
438. This restriction on resale is necessary because otherwise payment of a subsidy would permit
the purchaser of a subsidised dwelling to make a profit on its resale. At the same time, a provision of
this kind may help to stabilise property values.
439. This restriction on resale will have a definite advantage in the case of a genuine home
purchaser in assuring a buyer for the property in the event of a death, or a transfer to another area. In
the case of transfer, it would be desirable, where possible, for the housing authority to arrange for the
transfer of the purchaser’s equity from his original dwelling to one in the area to which he is transferred.
Where this is not possible, the provision for re-purchase would apply.


(d) Management of Housing Estates.
SUMMARY : (I) General considerations.
(2) Differing administrative problems to be met at different stages in development of a
housing estate :
(i) Decision to erect government-financed housing in a particular area.
(ii) Planning detail of the housing project.
(iii) Construction of buildings.
(iv) Initial occupation of the dwellings.
(v) Routine administration.
(vi) More than one project in a particular area.
(3) Need for trained officers and staff requirements.
(4) Special problems :
(i) Allocation of dwellings.
(ii) Maintenance.
(iii) Furniture.
(iv) Contact with occupants.
(v) Minor amenities.
(vi) Community facilities.
(vii) Community association.
(5) Aims of government-financed housing.
(1) General Considerations.
440. The State Housing Authority will be responsible for the actual construction of dwellings,
selection of sites on which they are to be constructed, and general administration.
441. It is impossible to lay down any detailed outline for the administration of particular housing
estates. Problems involved will be almost entirely new to Australia. Present State Housing Authorities
have built mainly in metropolitan areas, and any administrative machinery set up for housing outside
metropolitan areas will be largely experimental. It is, however, necessary to consider the problems
that will arise at each stage within the housing programme, and to discuss general principles, which should
guide later action. We stress that the administrative machinery must be flexible as between States and
parts of States and will need to be varied as the result of changing conditions.
(2) Differing Administrative Problems to be met at different stages in the Development of a
Housing Estate.
(i) Decision to Erect Government-financed Housing in a Particular Area.
442. There are two possibilities at this stage, namely, where the demand arises from local initiative
and where the decision to establish a government-financed housing project in that area has been made
by the State Housing Authority independently of organised local demand :
(a) where there is organised local demand this will be conveyed through the local government
authority to the State Housing Authority. If the proposal for housing in that area is approved
by the State Housing Authority, the local government authority may apply for delegation
to it of the necessary housing powers to proceed with the project. If the request for
delegation of powers is granted, this should be followed by the appointment of a local
housing officer responsible to the local government authority. (See paragraph 447 for
duties of local housing officer.) Local housing powers would then be exercised by the
local government authority through the local housing officer, subject to conditions laid
down by the State Housing Authority as approved by the Commonwealth Housing Authority.
In some cases the request may be for a delegation of only some of the housing powers
of the State Housing Authority ; for example, it might be agreed that the State Housing
Authority would plan and erect the dwellings but the local government authority might
administer them after erection, or the local government authority, without accepting any
responsibility for the housing project, might be willing to act as agent for the State Housing
Authority for the collection of rents or undertaking of repair work ; or
(b) where the original decision has been made by the State Housing Authority, this decision
should be discussed by officers of the State Housing Authority with the local government
authority with a view to that authority adopting the project ; should the local government
authority not wish to undertake the housing project the State Housing Authority should
then proceed. This discussion should be followed by the appointment of a local housing
officer by the State Housing Authority to work in collaboration with the local government
authority, but receive direct instructions and advice from the State Housing Authority.
Dissatisfaction has been created in the past where Commonwealth and State Housing
Authorities have ignored the local government authorities in respect of matters affecting
the development of areas within their boundaries. Notwithstanding the statutory powers
of State Housing Authorities, we feel that work proposed by them should be discussed with
the relative local government authority ; we are confident that mutual benefit would arise
from such discussion.


(ii) Planning betail of the Housing I'rojee..
'M 3 - Publicity should be continued throughout all discussions and planning. The desirability
, 1 J° n | by ‘f 6 rf e the P lannm § of their area has already been emphasised in paragraph 164.
Hniid ta 4 C fh P an ° f the housm ? project should be undertaken by the technical officers of the State
'r> Auth ° rlt y’together with the local housing officer and in consultation with the local government
authority ; where full housing powers have been delegated by the State Housing Authority to the local
government authority this authority should undertake the planning subject to the approval of the State
Housing Authority. Preliminary decisions should include :
(a) site selection;
A / e have recommended that each State Housing Authority should set up an advisory
committee on site selection (see paragraph 398). This committee may not always be able
to function personally outside the metropolitan area, in which case it will be necessary to
obtain technical advice from local persons. If the area has not been previously zoned or
town planned, preliminary work will have to be undertaken before site selection is made.
( b) dwelling types to be erected;
A decision will be required on the sizes of dwellings, the number of multi-storey
dwellings, attached dwelling units, and single dwelling units, and, also, the materials from
which these will be constructed.
(c) provision for community facilities ; and
(d) submission of project plans to the State Housing Authority for the necessary approval.
(iii) Construction of Buildings.
444. Construction of buildings may be by day labour or contract, as decided by the constructing
authority. During the period of construction, the housing officer will be able to establish the office
organisation needed and to prepare for the occupancy of the dwellings by explaining conditions of
occupancy and accepting applications therefor. There is likely to be a large number of enquiries during
this period, and it is important to ensure that some qualified person will be available to answer these
enquiries.
445. The technical work at this stage will include the provision of services, i.e., water, drainage,
light, etc., and the construction of dwellings and of minimum buildings for community facilities. Should
the construction be carried out by a local government authority, check inspections by the State Housing
Authority will be necessary.
(iv) Initial Occupation of the Dwellings.
446. Before the dwellings can be occupied, the following administrative matters must be
considered :
(a) conditions of occupancy;
These will be determined by the State Housing Authority in accordance with
conditions previously agreed with the Commonwealth Housing Authority.
( b) selection of occupants;
The principles to be followed in the selection of occupants will be determined by
the State Housing Authority, in accordance with conditions previously agreed by the
Commonwealth Housing Authority and will be administered by the local housing officer,
subject to appeal to the controlling authority.
(c) advice on furniture;
The housing officer, or welfare officer (see hereafter) if one has been appointed,
should encourage the selected occupants to avail themselves of advice on furniture and
furnishing (see also paragraph 463).
(d) information on community facilities.
The housing officer should explain to the selected occupants, by pamphlets or by
a public meeting, the community facilities which are being provided and those for which
sites have been left on the estate. In addition, he may suggest the formation of a community
association or progress association by the tenants, which would assist in the organisation
of community facilities, and discuss community problems. A detailed discussion of the
value of a local committee is included in paragraph 475.
(v) Routine Administration.
447. It should be emphasised again that each housing estate will have different problems, and
that it is impossible to list rigidly the duty which will be required of the housing officer. It is, however,
both possible and desirable to list some of the functions, which should be carried out at the local level
rather than from the central office of the State Housing Authority ; these are as follows :
(a) collection of rents and action regarding arrears ;
( b) keeping records of claims for rebates and forwarding a monthly statement to the State
Housing Authority;
(c) filling of vacancies;
(d) responsibility for repairs;
(e) responsibility for maintenance of any common ground or equipment;
(f) guarding against overcrowding and advising tenants to transfer to other dwellings where
desirable;


(g) passing on complaints by the community association about the functioning of any community
facility coming under the control of the State Housing or local government authority ; and
(h) public relations which would include disseminating information, if requested, assisting
the work of the community association, and effecting liaison with the authorities regarding
community services and facilities.
448. Wherever the size of the project warrants it, a welfare officer should be appointed as well
as a housing officer. The work of this officer would be to assist the occupants to settle down in their new
environment ; to undertake the public relations work which would otherwise be carried out by the
housing officer ; possibly, also, to assist in dealing with claims for rebates. In some cases the position
may be combined with that of supervisor of a community centre and, in others, it may be combined with
the work of rent collection.
(vi) More than One Project in a Particular Area.
449. Where more than one housing project is established in a particular area, a regional housing
officer may be required, responsible to the controlling authority. Under him and responsible to him there
may need to be a manager or caretaker for each housing estate.
(3) Need for Trained Officers and Staff Requirements.
450. The management of a housing estate requires tact and understanding, as well as some
technical qualifications. Some knowledge of law, accountancy, housing and social service is needed.
The training given to the housing officer is fundamental to the success of house management. WE
RECOMMEND suitable persons should be encouraged to train now in preparation for the administration
of the post-war housing estates. If additional rent collectors are to be employed, they also would require
a short period of training in housing legislation.
451. It is impossible to lay down the staff necessary for a housing estate of a given size. The
requirements must be flexible to suit the nature of the district, the type of occupant, and the adminis-
trative framework of the controlling authority.
452. The size of the estate will determine whether it is necessary to appoint a welfare worker
in addition to a manager, and whether additional supervisors are required for recreational facilities. In
the case of estates in a metropolitan area, it may be sufficient in a number of cases to have a welfare worker
attached to the estate, and the main work of management carried out from a central office.
453. In the same way the requirements for repairs, maintenance and office staff will vary according
to the size of the project and its distance from other projects. In an area where there are a number of
government housing estates, central repair and office staffs may be the most efficient. In smaller towns,
it may be possible to use the staff of the local government authority for repairs and maintenance. In
other cases, a large housing estate may find it more satisfactory to have a repair and maintenance staff
of its own.
454. It should be noted that the office work may be very heavy in the immediate post-war period,
due to the large volume of applicants for each group of government-financed houses ; this will necessitate
well-chosen office staff sufficient to attend expeditiously and efficiently to interviews and written
applications.
(4) Special Problems.
(i) Allocation of Dwellings.
455. Special problems arise in allocating dwellings, apart from those discussed in Section (3).
These problems include whether tenants from sub-standard areas should be re-housed adjacent to those
from better areas ; whether houses for sale should be interspersed with housing for rental ; and whether
family units of different sizes should be housed side by side. We believe that, as far as possible, each
estate should house a cross-section of the community—tenants, purchasers and family units of different
sizes and age groups should be interspersed.
456. Where a welfare officer has contacted a family in its previous home, as far as possible the
same officer should maintain the contact in the new home. It is undesirable that the family should be
approached by too many officials. Most tenants and home purchasers will be satisfactory from the
beginning, but all will appreciate help and co-operation provided it is given in the right manner. Where
possible, families should be given a reasonably wide choice of dwelling ; this is more important in the case
of purchase than renting. The freedom of choice should be compatible with the policy for the housing
estate.
(ii) Maintenance.
457. As far as possible, preference in construction should be given to materials which
require little maintenance. This need is emphasised by the Balfour Committee (“ Report of the
Home Management and Housing Association Sub-Committee of the Central Housing Advisory Committee
on the Management of Municipal Housing Estates ”, 1938) an extract from which report reads :
“ We wish to emphasise the importance of sound construction and finish in relation to property
management ; cheese-paring on essentials is bad business. Where the construction is sound, the
saving on actual repair costs is not the only economy. The well-built house is less affected by
extremes of weather and is accordingly less likely to be a source of expense in the matter of technical
supervision. For example, dampness in a wall may entail at least two visits of inspection, the first
to examine the house, ascertain the source of the dampness and order repairs ; the second after
the repairs have been completed to make sure that the work has been satisfactorily carried out.
In addition, the technical staff must arrange for labour and materials to be taken to the site, check
bills of cost and keep records up-to-date. All this and kindred work takes time and money and
inflates the cost of management.” (Page 18.)
M >2l30—E


458. All property should be thoroughly inspected, both inside as well as out, at regular intervals.
Systems adopted will vary with the housing authority, and must be left to its discretion.
459. A definite life should be assigned to the exterior paint work, and painting should take place
at regular intervals. Internal painting and redecorating should depend upon inspection. Washable
paint rather than distemper should be used in such rooms as kitchens and bathrooms. If the cost of
washable paint is high it might be applied to the portions where wear is greatest.
460. Redecoration should be the responsibility of the Housing Authority and should not be left
to the tenant. But the tenant should not be discouraged if he wishes to do the work.
461. It is unwise to rely wholly upon the tenant to report disrepair ; to secure his co-operation,
a system of repair cards for transmission through the post is recommended.
462. A card index should be kept giving the repairs history of the house from the time of the
first letting.
(iii) Furniture.
463. Financial assistance should be available to occupants for purchase of certain essential furniture.
We have recommended that the State Housing Authority be empowered to make advances for this purpose
where the Housing Authority is satisfied that this is necessary. (See paragraph 396 and Model Housing
Act, Appendix VI.) This should be supplemented by the provision of a workroom on the estate with a
supply of tools and classes of instruction for the making of furniture. In this connection reference might
also be made to the discussion of furniture in paragraphs 670-674.
(iv) Contact with Occupants.
464. As far as possible, regular contact should be maintained by the management with each tenant
or home purchaser, and a record of the occupancy of each house should be kept on a card index.
465. There is divergence of opinion concerning rent collection. The Balfour Committee holds
that “ door to door ” rent collection is preferable to having payments made at an estate office, as tenants
are thus brought into more intimate touch with their local authority landlord. Other authorities prefer
a rent collection office on each estate.
466. Another, and somewhat different argument, concerns whether the welfare worker should
collect rents, as advocated by the Society of Women Housing Managers, England, who support the view
of Octavia Hill, that rent collection is the best method of establishing good permanent relationships,
since it gives the welfare worker a regular opportunity for visiting the house. It is, however, noteworthy
that the Victorian Housing Commission has gradually abandoned the method of rent collection by welfare
workers in favour of a system of estate rent offices, where the welfare worker is in attendance on the days
prescribed for rent payment, principally because “ there is a physical difficulty if rents are to be collected
as near as possible to the time when wages are paid.” We consider that the balance of advantage depends
upon circumstances, and upon the type of persons housed, and, accordingly, it will be necessary to adopt
procedure suitable for each particular estate.
467. Where rent rebates are granted, the welfare worker should assess the need both initially
and from time to time, and make recommendations to the Housing Authority.
(v) Minor Amenities.
468. Gardens and Nature Strips.— Suitable steps should be taken to ensure that gardens
and yards generally be kept neat and tidy. This is the responsibility primarily of the occupant, and
should be part of the contract.
469. Whilst the care of the “ nature strip ” outside the front fence is the responsibility of the
local government authority, the occupants should be encouraged to care for same.
470. Sheds. —Sheds for odd jobs and simple handicrafts should be provided, the location and
design of which is a matter for the authority, but no shed should be erected without the approval of the
authority.
471. Handbook of Information. —The Balfour Committee has recommended extension of
the practice of some English local authorities of issuing handbooks “ containing a compendium of useful
information and general advice on points dealing with conditions of tenancy and on the use of the house
and its appliances. Such information often includes simple cooking recipes, suggestions for planting
the garden, hints on the care of the lawn and instructions on how to proceed in cases of common emergency.
Detailed particulars of the welfare centres and clinics and other health services are also valuable.
WE RECOMMEND that handbooks containing basic information should be issued to new tenants and
purchasers.
472. Rent Books.— WE RECOMMEND that every tenant should also be supplied with a rent
book wherein is inscribed the name of the tenant, name and address of the Housing Authority, the name
and address of the health authority, the standard of occupancy, the assessed weekly rent, and a summary
in prescribed form of the relative tenancy provision of the Act and also wherein all payments for rents
will be recorded, and all arrears of rent, if any, shown.
473. Pass Books for Purchasers. —WE RECOMMEND that each purchaser should be supplied
with a pass book giving similar information to the rent book.
(vi) Community Facilities.
474. We have already stressed the importance of community facilities and have recommended
that each housing estate should be provided with the facilities listed in paragraph 831.


(vii) Community Association .
475. Any government housing project is financed by the community as a whole ; there is often,
however, a tendency on the part of specific groups to feel that the government is something divorced from
themselves, and to which they owe no responsibility. One of the advantages of fostering local initiative
in any government-financed housing programme is that the people are thereby encouraged to feel that
the housing belongs to them. The greater the share that can be given to local community associations
in the planning and administration of housing programmes, the greater will be this sense of responsibility,
and, therefore, the greater the care and attention that will be given to maintenance of the housing. We
have already stressed this approach when we recommended the delegation of housing powers to local
government authorities and, recommended, also, that the initiative for the supply of recreational and
cultural facilities should come always from the people, and that their maintenance should be the
responsibility of the local community association. We consider that this approach should be applied
also in the management of housing projects, and that where the occupants of the dwellings show any desire
to take an interest in the whole estate, they should be encouraged to do so.
476. It should be part of the policy of the Housing Authority to foster the growth of community
associations, which might be responsible for the maintenance of certain community facilities, and which
might act also as a channel for suggestions from the occupants of the houses to the housing officer. In
many English estates tenants’ committees (community associations) have been set up and are functioning
satisfactorily.
(5) Aims of Government-financed Housing.
477. In any discussion of the management of government-financed housing projects, it should
be borne in mind that the policy implementing a housing programme is to ensure the good housing of
the low wage earner and of large families. This means that tenants will not be selected according to
ability to pay nor excluded because of possible damage to property by large families. The aim of the
management should be to secure an efficient administration in the sense of adequate, well-kept accounts
and speed in the execution of repairs, etc., but not necessarily to show any financial profit.
478. The housing of families in need of social re-education will cause many difficulties to the
management ; the measure of success of the management should be by a steady improvement in the
attitude of these tenants towards the property and increased sense of responsibility for paying rent.
479. It should be emphasised in selecting and training officers to work on housing estates that
those selected should appreciate that amongst the fundamental needs are not only the good housing of
the people, but, through this, a general re-education of the people to a fuller social life and a fuller exercise
of the rights of citizenship.
C. PRIORITIES IN ALLOTTING DWELLINGS.
(a) Groups which should Receive Preference in Allotment of Government-financed Dwellings.
480. During the period when the demand for dwellings is greater than the supply, it will be
necessary to lay down general principles for selecting occupants for new dwellings erected under the
government housing programme, and for the issue of permits for private residential building. The
simplest method probably would be to consider priority of application only ; this is clearly inequitable.
48L There is fairly general agreement that certain sections of the people require special
consideration. Discharged defence personnel are at a disadvantage in relation to others in that many of
them are without a dwelling at all, and most of them lack knowledge of present conditions in the area
where they wish to live after discharge. Persons at present living in dwellings which are seriously
overcrowded, or unfit for human habitation, have a strong claim to be allotted good standard housing.
Special provision should be made for all these sections in a government housing programme.
482. Until the housing shortage is overtaken and sub-standard dwellings replaced, the demand
for dwellings will be greater than the supply. During this period WE RECOMMEND that preference in
allotting government-financed dwellings should be given according to the urgency of need to :
(1) discharged defence personnel and other eligible persons, as provided in the Commonwealth
War Service Homes Act, who should receive a percentage of the total dwellings available ;
(2) those inadequately or unhygienically housed ; and
(3) those with low incomes.
In all cases special consideration should be given to those with large families.
483. It has been suggested that rural housing should receive a specific priority in any scale for
allotting government-financed dwellings. There are, however, difficulties in administering this in any
rigid way. We consider that the approach to the problem should be by means of a full housing survey
throughout the State concerned. Dwellings would then be allocated to specific areas. In the case of
rural townships priorities for allotting these dwellings would be administered in the same way as for
large cities. As regards farms, the decision as to the number of dwellings to be erected must be reached
by somewhat different assumptions. Where a city dweller has no house, he can often share with
somebody else. A farmer without a house, however, is not able to do this. Therefore, where there
is a farm with either no dwelling or a dwelling which is unfit for human habitation, some priority should
be granted in allotting dwellings (see paragraphs 356-360).


(b) Methods of Administering Preference.
484. It is not difficult to decide which groups in the community should receive preference in
allotment of government-financed dwellings, but difficulty arises when an attempt is made to work out
a system of administering this preference.
485. WE RECOMMEND that a definite proportion of government-financed dwellings should be
allotted to defence personnel (on service or discharged), such proportion to be determined from time
to time by the Commonwealth Housing Authority, in accordance with the estimated demand.
486. WE RECOMMEND that, within each group, dwellings should be allotted in accordance
with the principles set out in paragraph 482. These principles might be applied by a system of rating by
granting points for such claims to preference as :
(A) war service as defined by the Commonwealth Government, including widows or dependents
of defence personnel ;
(B) family size ;
(C) income less than the basic wage ;
(D) bad housing conditions ; and
(E) high present rent.
487. In allotting houses for purchase, “ (C) income less than the basic wage should be removed
from the list, since we consider that a person earning less than the basic wage is not in a position to purchase
a dwelling. Another category, “ (F) owning land or deposit ” might be added ; it is reasonable to give
some preference to the person who has been saving for a dwelling ; this would, of course, be conditional
upon such person owning no other dwelling and requiring the dwelling for personal occupation.
488. The person with the highest rating would not necessarily be granted the first house to
become available, because the locality might not be suitable or for some other special reason. The aim
should be to house people within not more than a half hour’s travel of their work. Where several persons
receive the same rating, and the locality is suitable, the allotment of the dwelling should be decided by
ballot.
489. The points to be granted to particular categories may vary from time to time.
490. Appendix XI, Table I, suggests an allocation of points under this system. Table II shows
three examples of the rating of applications under this system, and Table 111 gives some detailed examples
of its application. A statement on some of the advantages of this method is also included in Appendix XI.
491. WE RECOMMEND that the points priorities system of allotment of government-financed
dwellings should be submitted to a conference of State representatives as a suggestion for discussion with
a view to obtaining uniform procedure.
(c) Application of Points Priorities System to Permits for Private Building.
492. In Part IV we have recommended the continuance for a period after the war of the issue of
permits for building. This recommendation was made as we are of the opinion that for some years after
the war it may be impossible to satisfy the accumulated demand for housing. The need for a system ot
permits for the erection of private dwellings is thus comparable with the need for a system of allotting
government-financed dwellings.
493. At present, building permits are controlled by the Commonwealth Government under
National Security Regulations. WE RECOMMEND that if the Commonwealth Government is not
enabled to continue the issue of building permits in the post-war period the States should be asked o
take action to control the issue of building permits on lines to be recommended by the Commonwealth
Government. In any case we consider that the issuing of permits for private 7 l s,^\ntl^1 , bu ' d ' s^ uld ’
if necessary by arrangement with the Commonwealth Government, be contro led by the State Housing
Authority, with power to delegate to a local government authority, so that all housing activities wi
the State may be centralised under one body.
494. The allocation of the housing programme between different housing, b ° dies '" lthl "
State will be carried out by the State Housing Authority after collaboration wlth e P '
Authority. This allocation will require the issue of a corresponding number of buMdmg Pe™**
eligible persons, therefore, WE RECOMMEND that permits for private dweMings should be issued in
accordance with the principles agreed to be applied to the allotment of government-financed dwellings.
D. SUBSIDIES.
SUMMARY : (a) General considerations.
( b ) Private building.
(c) Government-financed dwellings.
(1) War Service Homes for purchase.
(2) Other government-financed dwellings for purchase in cities and towns.
(i) General considerations.
(ii) Subsidy to prices of building materials.
(iii) Assistance by government loans.
(iv) Subsidised interest rate.
(v) Repayments fluctuating with income with restricted right of resale
(3) Government-financed dwellings for purchase in rural areas.
(4) Government-financed dwellings for rental.
(d) Method of making payments to States.
(e) Bodies to which subsidies may be paid.


(a) General Considerations.
495. As building costs have risen greatly during the war and will probably continue at a high
level for some years thereafter, the cost of housing of the standard recommended by us as a minimum is
beyond the capacity of the basic wage earner. We consider that the basic wage earner should not be
required to pay for rental more than one-sixth of the family income (as computed in Appendix XII) nor
more than one-fifth for home purchase (including interest, purchase money, fire insurance, rates and
taxes, but not maintenance). Therefore, WE RECOMMEND that the Commonwealth Government
should subsidise housing erected by approved government authorities, so that the payment made by the
occupant should not exceed one-sixth of the family income for rental and one-fifth for home purchase.
A subsidised dwelling must be of not less than the approved standard and not more than a maximum cost
(see paragraph 622). It is hoped that payment of a subsidy will be a stimulus to investigation of improved
building methods and, eventually, cause the cost of building to be reduced to a level where payment of a
subsidy will become unnecessary.
496. This policy was advocated in our First Interim Report (21st October, 1943). Following this
report, housing policy was discussed by Cabinet in November, 1943, and Cabinet accepted the principle
of government assistance to enable persons with low incomes and persons with large families to obtain
a good standard dwelling. Cabinet approved the principle of rental rebates to reduce the rent paid to
one-fifth of the family income where such portion of the income is less than the economic rent. We
consider that this proportion is too high, but hope that the acceptance of the principle of housing subsidies
may be followed by a reduction in the proportion of the family income allotted to rent until it agrees
with our recommendation.
497. A number of different methods of subsidising housing has been suggested to us. The main
methods suggested are a subsidy to the prices of building materials, a capital subsidy paid annually, a
subsidised interest rate and rebates of payments according to the income of the purchaser. These are
discussed later in this section.
498. In general, any principle of subsidy to fulfil its purpose must be related to one or more of
the three following factors :
(1) the standard of the dwelling;
It would be possible to lower housing standards so that the low
wage earner could afford the economic payment for a dwelling.
(2) the cost of building;
The number of persons needing a subsidy has been greatly increased
by the present high cost of building. If research enables a steady reduction
in building costs to be effected, it may eventually be unnecessary to subsidise
housing for the low wage earner.
(3) the income of the occupant.
The two previous factors have meaning only in relation to the income
of the occupant of the dwelling.
499. The Commission considers that the aim should be to relate the cost of domestic building
to the basic wage in such a manner that the economic payment for a good standard house is within the
means of the basic wage earner.
500. WE RECOMMEND that general assistance to all housing should be granted by removing
the sales tax on building materials. This would assist private as well as government-financed building.
The need for removing the tax is most urgent in the case of low-cost housing. If government policy
precludes removal of the sales tax on all building materials, we suggest that this tax might be replaced
by a tax levied on the cost of completed buildings and that dwellings costing less than a cost to be
determined should be exempted.
( b) Private Building.
501. Private building for this purpose covers all dwelling units other than government-financed
housing. This section of the housing programme will receive no subsidy. It may, however, be aided
by :
(1) abolition of sales tax ;
(2) government advances to semi-government institutions and some private organisations
for lending for home purchase on easy terms and conditions ;
Note.—The interest rate to borrowers may be slightly less than th<"
usual mortgage rate.
(3) making available technical advice and services at low cost ; and
(4) a government guarantee of an approved portion of advances made by approved financial
institutions on approved terms and conditions for home purchase.
502. As no subsidy will be paid to private building, the only means of ensuring that this class of
building is of good standard will be by control through :
(1) town-planning legislation ;
(2) continuance of the issue of permits for building until the housing shortage is alleviated ;
(3) control of allocation of building resources in the immediate post-war period ;
(4) ultimately by the acceptance of a Commonwealth uniform building code ; and
(5) strict enforcement of building regulations by local government authorities.


(c) Government-financed Dwellings.
(1) War Service Homes for Purchase.
503. The granting of any special terms and conditions to borrowers under the Commonwealth
War Service Homes Act is a matter for decision by the government. As in the case of civilians, additional
assistance should be provided, if the income of the applicant is insufficient to allow economic payments
for a good standard dwelling.
(2) Other Government-financed Dwellings for Purchase in Cities and Towns.
(i) General Considerations.
504. In the past, it has been impossible for low wage earners to purchase homes of a good standard
without prejudicing the amount available for food, clothing and recreation for themselves and their
families. Evidence from all States indicates that a large number of people have a strong desire for home
ownership. While this situation continues a government-financed housing programme should provide,
as far as possible, for home purchase by low income earners, even to the extent of financial assistance whilst
building costs make payments for home purchase above one-fifth of their income.
505. The possibility of a realised capital gain to the heme purchaser from a subsidy to home
purchase can be avoided if a clause is included in the State Housing Act restricting resale or transfer (see
paragraphs 436-439).
506. S ince Cabinet has approved the principle of rental rebates to bring the rent paid to one-fifth
of the family income of the tenant, not one-sixth, as recommended by us, we consider that it may be
necessary to increase the proportion of income allotted to home purchase above the one-fifth recommended
in our First Interim Report. We consider that efforts should be made to have these proportions reduced,
possibly by concentrating on reducing building costs.
507. We consider that subsidies for purchase of government-financed dwellings should be based
on a weekly payment which even the basic wage earner can afford. Therefore, in the light of the
government’s decision regarding the level of rents for government-financed housing THE MAJORITY
OF THE COMMISSION RECOMMENDS (see Minority recommendation) that the standard weekly
payment for purchase of government-financed dwellings (including interest, purchase money for land*
and dwelling, fire insurance and rates, but not maintenance), should not exceed 22\ per cent, of the
weekly basic wage for a two-bedroom house of the approved standard and 25 per cent, for a three-bedroom
house of the approved standard (see Appendix X, Division (ii) ) and the difference between the economic
and the standard payment should be made up by a government subsidy. The subsidy required for home
purchase will then be calculated by capitalising over the period of the purchase the standard weekly
payment at the rate of interest charged the purchaser. Where the capital cost so obtained is less than
the cost to the Authority as determined in the manner agreed with the Commonwealth Housing Authority
(see paragraphs 606-609), this amount should be provided by the Commonwealth and State Governments
in proportions to be determined by agreement between them. It is a matter of government policy
whether this sum is to be paid by subsidising the interest rate and/or by a capital grant.
508. In determining the capital cost of dwellings of the approved standard for subsidy purposes
(both for renting and for purchase) the procedure outlined in paragraphs 606-609 should be followed ;
this should be administered by the Commonwealth Housing Authority with close liaison with the
Experimental Building Station and the various State Housing Authorities. If this be done eventually
it will be possible to declare, quarterly or half-yearly as decided, a subsidy of a stated sum for each dwelling
of the approved standard at an amount per square foot for each State and parts of each State. This will
have, in addition, the effect of giving due regard to assistance for home occupiers (for rental or for purchase)
in the outlying parts of the Commonwealth, and thus assist to offset the higher costs of housing in these
parts.
509. The system of allocating dwellings suggested in paragraphs 480-494 will ensure that, during
the early post-war period, dwellings erected under this scheme will be occupied only by persons with
low incomes and/or large families. If considered desirable, however, the subsidy for home purchase
could be confined to those with under a stated income. Whether these persons are to be housed by the
government under a rental or purchase scheme, the cost to the government will be much the same.
It is hoped that, by the time persons with higher incomes would secure a dwelling, building costs will
have fallen so that a subsidy will not be necessary, or the basic wage may have been increased, thus
enabling a larger liability to be undertaken. A combination of both these factors may eliminate the
necessity for any subsidy.
510. There are strong arguments for the capital grant being paid as an annual subsidy, as this
gives greater control over the observance of the conditions thereof. The main arguments for making
the payment in a lump sum on the construction of the dwelling is that, from the point of view of the
subsidising authority, the transaction is completed at once, and no further charge can be made on it. From
the point of view of the autho»«ty to which the advance is made there is an advantage in a lump
sum payment, in that there is then no possibility of a withdrawal of the subsidy at a later stage. We
consider, however, that the payment by annual instalments is much the better method.
511. This recommendation has been made after considering a number of suggestions for
government assistance to home purchase. We include below some of the main suggestions which were
discussed, see sections (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v).
* If land is held on perpetual leasehold tenure (see paragraphs 308-310) the rent of the lease will need to be considered
instead of the purchase money of the freehold land.


(ii) Subsidy to Prices of Building Materials.
512. It has been suggested that the best method of subsidising housing would be by granting a
subsidy to the prices of building materials in the same way, as has been done with standard items of
consumption during the war period, i.e., the government pays the difference between the economic price
and the price at which it wishes the goods to be sold ; this is being done at present in England and Canada,
as well as in Australia. At first sight, the suggestion may seem attractive. It is comparatively easy to
administer and fulfils part of the aim, which is to reduce the cost of building to the people as a whole.
There are, however, two fundamental difficulties.
513. First : this method of subsidy precludes any conditions being attached to the standard of
dwelling which receives the subsidy ; we feel that if the community, as a whole, as taxpayers, is to bear
the cost of a subsidy, it is entitled to demand in return that the standard of housing throughout the
community should be improved ; this means that the subsidy should be of a type which will be granted
only where the dwelling erected is of an approved standard.
514. Second : a subsidy to building materials would automatically be available to anyone
undertaking building. We can see no reason why the people as a whole should subsidise the erection of
commercial buildings or the erection of luxury dwellings. We have, therefore, rejected this method of
Government subsidy to building.
(iii) Assistance by Government Loans.
515. It is possible for the government to render substantial assistance to home purchasers without
actually subsidising the housing, e.g., loans on prescribed conditions may be made for home purchase
through a government agency at the average rate payable by the government on the whole of the amount
made available, plus a percentage for administration ; this rate would probably be about I per cent, below
the rate at which private institutions would make advances for this purpose, and may be still lower, if the
money allocated to housing is derived from a combination of loans, bank credit and taxation, and not
wholly from loan.
516. This factor would give home purchasers receiving advances from government agencies a
substantial advantage over borrowers from private institutions. We consider, however, that within
the immediate post-war period, assistance of this kind would not be sufficient to bring home purchase
within the reach of the low wage earner without unduly lengthening the period of repayment.
(iv) Subsidised Interest Rate.
517. Witnesses from all States generally held that the most satisfactory way for the government
to aid the housing of the people is for the money for housing to be advanced either interest-free or at
a rate of interest well below the current rate for advances for home purchase. We are anxious that in
order to reduce the cost of housing to the people, the rate of interest should be kept as low as possible,
but we recognise that, if the government lends money at less than the rate it pays for it, the people in
general must make up the difference, and thus in effect are subsidising home purchase.
Note. —A minority recommendation is made regarding this method.
(v) Repayments Fluctuating with Income with Restricted Right of Resale.
518. Possibly the most equitable type of subsidy as between individuals would be one where
repayments vary with fluctuations of income in the same way as rental rebates (see paragraph 522). This
has two main disadvantages :
(a) it increases enormously the work of administration ; and
(b) it almost eliminates the distinction between renting and purchasing a dwelling.
Note. —lf the home purchaser cannot expect to maintain an income
which will provide steady payments at a reasonable level he should not
contract to purchase a home but to rent one. This is an important matter
requiring efficient and diplomatic attention by administrators of housing
schemes.
(3) Government-financed Dwellings for Purchase in Rural Areas.
519. Rural housing is discussed in Part XIV. It is unnecessary to do more in this section than
to point out that a subsidy as recommended in paragraph 507 allows for adjustment to meet different
building costs in different areas, and to stress that we consider that the standard of housing in rural areas
must be raised to the standard approved for urban areas. Provision of government assistance in the
form of subsidies, investigation of improved building methods and publicity will help to raise the standard.
520. It is frequently suggested that the erection of good standard housing in both townships and
on rural properties should be assisted by transporting building materials on government railways, either
free or at low freights. This would certainly assist the home purchaser in rural areas, but it should be
recognised that it is a subsidy in the same way as if the government paid directly to the home purchaser
an amount equivalent to the waived or reduced freight.
(4) Government-financed Dwellings for Rental.
521. There is a section of the community whose income is lower than that which has been accepted
in the basic wage as adequate for the adult wage earner ; old age and invalid pensioners form a large
proportion of this section. These people require some special assistance in order to secure housing
of a reasonable standard. At the same time, the low wage earner also is unable, with building costs at
their present level, to secure reasonable housing for payments which he can afford.


522. WE RECOMMEND that where the economic rent of government-financed housing exceeds
one-sixth of the family income as calculated in Appendix XII, the Commonwealth Government should
contribute to a subsidy to the tenant in the form of a rental rebate to cover the difference between the
economic rent and the agreed proportion of the family income, the rebated rents being continued or
adjusted each six months upon application of the tenant.
523. Evidence submitted to us states that improved housing will improve health and social
outlook, thus decreasing public expenditure on hospitalisation, juvenile delinquency, and adult crime ;
therefore, WE RECOMMEND that State Governments should contribute to the cost of rental rebates
as well as the Commonwealth Government in proportions to be agreed.
524. One detailed method of calculating the rental rebate is set out in Appendix XII, and a formula
for calculating the economic rent is given in Appendix XIII.
525. The system outlined in Appendix XII, based on the capacity to pay, is equitable in operation.
Similar systems have operated in Victoria and in parts of England. There are, however, difficulties in
applying this principle in Australia, at present, or in the immediate post-war period, because it seems
probable that under the suggested system of allocation of government-financed dwellings and the
anticipated high level of building costs, it might be necessary to grant rental rebates to almost all tenants
of government dwellings erected in the early post-war years. Two important difficulties are :
(i) the administrative difficulty of calculating the rebates every six months—the office work
involved may prove to be an insuperable difficulty ; and
(ii) the tenant on an income below the basic wage may be prepared to give the necessary details
about his financial position in order to secure the rebate, but the skilled tradesman who
is earning above the basic wage may resent an enquiry into his family affairs, particularly
when it involves not only his own affairs but also those of all members of the family. In
some cases, he will prefer to pay the full economic rent to the detriment of other family
needs. In other cases, he may prefer to remain in a dwelling of a lower standard, where he
pays a definite rent and no questions are asked.
526. Accordingly, WE RECOMMEND that a capital subsidy to offset high building costs should
be granted by the Commonwealth and State Governments in agreed proportions to all government-
financed dwellings for rental, so as to reduce the rent charged to a standard rent of, say, £1 per week for
a two-bedroom dwelling, with a proportionate increase for a three-bedroom dwelling. Unless building
costs fall greatly, this standard rent will be lower than the economic rent. Rental rebates, which involve
an investigation of the family income, would be required only where the family income is less than, say,
£5 per week, or for a tenant with a large family.
527. The system of allocating dwellings suggested in paragraphs 480-494 will ensure that, during
the early post-war period, dwellings erected under this scheme will be occupied mainly by persons with
low incomes and/or large families. If considered desirable, however, tenancy of government dwellings
could be confined to those with under a stated income.
(d) Method of Making Payments to States.
528. We have recommended that the method of rendering assistance to tenants and purchasers
of government-financed dwellings should first be a matter of agreement between the Commonwealth
and the States. When this agreement has been reached, we consider that the detailed accounts should
be kept by the State Housing Authority or the body to which it has delegated its authority to administer
housing projects. These accounts should be subject to audit at the end of each year by the State Auditor-
General. The State would then lodge a claim with the Commonwealth for the amount of subsidy granted
on approved principles during the preceding year. If it seems desirable, arrangements might be made
for an advance to be granted by the Commonwealth for current payments with a settlement at the end
of each financial year.
529. We have recommended that the Commonwealth Government should be given the right
to undertake check audits, if required, but we do not anticipate that it should be necessary to exercise
this power.
(e) bodies to which Subsidies may be Paid.
530. The agreement on the principles of subsidies would be made between the Commonwealth
and States. It must then rest with the State Housing Authority to determine to what bodies, if any,
it will delegate some of its functions, though the Commonwealth Housing Authority would receive a list
of these bodies and their housing programmes. Where, for example, local government authorities
undertake approved government housing projects by the acceptance of delegated powers from the State
Housing Authority, they will receive through the State Housing Authority the relative share of the
Commonwealth subsidy. We consider that the Commonwealth Government should make one payment
to each State and the State concerned should then be responsible for apportioning this payment between
the different bodies which are administering subsidised housing.
E. FINANCE FOR GOVERNMENT-FINANCED HOUSING.
(a) Source of Funds.
531. It has been made clear in this report that this Commission regards the provision of a good
standard of housing for the low income group, at least, as a government responsibility. Because of this,
we have maintained in the previous section that, if housing cannot be provided for reasonable payments,
subsidies should be paid by the governments. The source of finance for this housing is, however, dependent
upon general financial policy and we do not consider that we are required by the terms of reference to
report upon this subject.


532. However, during the taking of evidence many witnesses advocated that central bank credit
should be used to finance a housing programme. This view was generally supported by the argument
that housing results in a tangible asset to the community ; other witnesses contended that the funds
for housing should be raised by general taxation, while others contended that the funds should be raised
by a combination of taxation, central bank credit and government loan.
(b) Housing Fund.
533. It has been suggested to this Commission that the money made available by the
Commonwealth Government for housing should be paid in the form of annual instalments over a definite
period to State Housing Funds, administered by the State Housing Authorities. The proposal is that
all rents and repayments should be credited to the fund so that the money required for new building is
eventually provided entirely by receipts from existing housing.
534. The two main witnesses who have advocated the establishment of such a housing fund are
the Chairman of the New South' Wales Housing Commission (Mr. B. H. Nolan) and the Lord Mayor of
Brisbane (Mr. J. B. Chandler, M.L.A.). The essential features of Mr. Nolan’s proposal are that a permanent
pool of money should be made available by the Commonwealth and the State Governments interest-free
to the State Housing Authority, without provision for repayment. Home purchasers should be charged
4j{ per cent, on advances from this pool and receipts from sales or rent should return to the pool to be used
for further building. A fresh grant to the pool should be made each year, the size of the grant depending
on the extent to which the fund becomes self-supporting.
535. Mr. Chandler’s proposal is that the Commonwealth Government should make available
£lO m. a year for twenty years from taxation, to local government authorities or other bodies for housing.
This money should be interest-free to the Housing Authority, but the home purchaser should be required
to pay £5O a year for thirty years for a dwelling costing £l,OOO, thus in effect paying interest on the advance.
Repayments should be credited to a housing fund and be used for further advances. At the end of twenty
years, 200,000 dwellings costing £l,OOO each would have been erected from the sum of £2OO m. and 130,650
from the income on the capital sum advanced, making a total of 330,650 dwellings erected in twenty years.
Assuming that no advance is made by the Commonwealth Government after twenty years and the
repayments of £lO m. per year to the Commonwealth commenced in the thirty-first year, the sum would
be repaid in the fifty-first year.
536. The above proposals would mean that the future programme of the State Housing Authority
would be assured and it would not be concerned about securing approval for specific projects.
537. We have, however, stated earlier in this report that there is need for planning at the national
level. This can best be secured in regard to housing by co-ordination of State policies through the
Commonwealth Housing Authority and the Commonwealth Planning Authority already recommended.
The administration of these authorities should provide opportunity for long-term planning.
538. The objection to State housing funds which has been noted above does not apply to a
Commonwealth Housing Fund. We consider that there are advantages in Commonwealth finance for
housing being paid into a housing fund from which allocations are made to State Housing Authorities.
(c) Amount of Finance Required for the Projected Government-financed Housing Programme.
539. It is impossible to make an accurate estimate of the finance required for the projected
government-financed housing programme in the early post-war period. To do so it would be necessary
to know in detail :
(1) the areas where building would take place ;
(2) the type and number of dwellings to be constructed in each area and the materials of which
they would be built ;
(3) building costs in each area ;
(4) the cost of land in each area and its development cost, where not subdivided or provided
with utilities ; and
(5) cost of the community facilities it is necessary for the Housing Authority to provide in
each area and their relation to (2) and (3).
540. Clearly, it is impossible to make an estimate on this basis until preliminary details of housing
projects have been completed by all States. Equally, it is necessary for the Commonwealth Government
to have some idea of its probable financial commitment. We would suggest that, as a rough preliminary
figure, it should be assumed that the 30,000 government-financed dwellings to be erected in the first
post-war year will cost at least £3O m., inclusive of the cost and development of land and the cost of land
and essential buildings for community facilities.
541. This estimate should, of course, be subject to constant revision in the light of detailed housing
plans. Even when a comparatively reliable figure is available for the first post-war year this cannot be
regarded as the annual commitment, since costs may be substantially affected by experience in large-scale
construction, the development of new materials and building methods, and the return of efficient labour
to the building industry.
542. Cost of Subsidies. The amount of subsidy required is similarly impossible to calculate
accurately Estimates made by officers assisting the Commission suggest that the cost of subsidies might
rise from £500,000 in the second post-war year to £5 m. a year at the end of a ten years’ housing programme
if no economies in cost are made. The amount of subsidy required will decrease if building costs fall
without a corresponding decrease in wages,


543. As much as can be said at this stage is that the projected housing programme might involve
spending about £45 m. in the third post-war year for land, dwellings, community facilities and subsidies.
It might be considered advisable to meet a portion of this amount from revenue to cover community
facilities and subsidies. It has been advocated to the Commission that the cost of subsidies, especially
as the expenditure on rental rebates is a social service matter, may be met by amending the constitution
of the National Welfare Fund to enable such expenditure to be charged thereto.
F. CONDITIONS OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE.
544. Various sections of this report have dealt with individual conditions, which we recommend
should be attached to financial assistance granted by the Commonwealth Government to authorities
controlling housing projects. It is useful here to summarise these conditions :
(1) satisfactory provisions to be made for town planning, including community facilities
(paragraph 185) ;
(2) setting up of State Housing Authorities with the powers listed in Section A of this Part
(paragraph 392) ;
(3) building to the standard approved by the Commonwealth Housing Authority (paragraph
622) ;
(4) costs not to exceed the unit cost approved by the Commonwealth Housing Authority
(paragraph 507) ;
(5) government-financed dwelling units to be allotted in accordance with a system of priorities
agreed upon between the Commonwealth and the States (paragraph 491) ;
(6) assistance to home purchasers and rental rebates to be granted according to methods agreed
between the Commonwealth and the States (paragraphs 507, 523, 524) ;
(7) other administrative conditions recommended in paragraphs 422-439 to be observed
(paragraph 424) ; and
(8) the Commonwealth Housing Authority to be empowered to make check inspections of
housing projects and/or buildings, check audits of accounts and check inspections of
community facilities (paragraph 376).
545. Several States already contemplate most of the measures recommended above as conditions
of financial assistance, therefore, little further action will be required by them.


Part IX. Organisation of the Building Industry.
SUMMARY : A. General considerations.
8. Inferences to be drawn from Examination of Resources Required.
C. Principal Causes of Inefficiency.
D. Factors tending to Increase and Oppose Changes in the Industry.
E. Proposals for increasing Efficiency.
F. Conclusions.
A. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.
546. The exact size of the post-war demand for the services of the building industry is not known ;
it is certain to be much larger than before the war, especially in the early post-war years. The target
for housing has been fixed at double the best pre-war period. The rate of public works construction
has not been fixed, although a programme equal to two years’ peace-time work is being drawn up ; this
may be carried out in one year or less, depending upon the availability of resources and the general state
of economic activity. The demand of private enterprise on the building industry, excluding housing,
is unknown, but is sure to be very great because of the accumulated demand due to the wartime restriction
of building. In general, the demand may be divided between that needed for domestic, industrial, social,
and governmental building with their necessary ancillary services.
547. The tasks which the building industry will be called upon to perform after the war, especially
in the housing field, will be much bigger than those undertaken before the war. Further, the residential
building industry had not reached a high level of efficiency in the past, and probably has deteriorated
during the war years.
548. In order to reach post-war objectives, it will be necessary first to restore and then to increase
the size of the industry, to reinstate former building operatives and train new ones, to recommence the
production of domestic appliances, to facilitate the reorganisation of building firms and the development
of new ones. It will also be necessary to raise the efficiency of the industry and of the individuals comprising
it by the use of improved methods of building, and by the extension of training of technicians. In a
sentence, the task is greatly to increase both the size of the industry and its efficiency.
549. Estimates of the total building resources required are being made, and it is apparent that it
will be necessary to curtail some sections of the total building programme to an extent which will balance
the total resources and manpower available. Parts X and XI outline a preliminary approach to the question
of labour and materials for post-war domestic building.
550. In estimating labour requirements, the number of men engaged both in the field erection
and the manufacturing sphere must be considered. It has been said that, in the past, a given amount of
field labour required almost the same amount of labour in the factory, forest, mine and workshop. One
difficulty in compiling estimates is that of forecasting the effect of new methods and new materials which
may be used in post-war work. Radical changes may ultimately be expected ; but the programme will
undoubtedly commence with the use of old methods. The time needed to tool up to new methods, and
the uncertainty of their success, until tested, make this necessary. The estimates being made are based
on this assumption. However, it is necessary that rational methods of field organisation, ordering of
materials, standardisation of parts and simplification of design should be adopted. Obviously, the first
step will be to restore the organisation as far as possible, preparatory to its expansion and rationalisation.
B. INFERENCES TO BE DRAWN FROM EXAMINATION OF RESOURCES
REQUIRED.
551. A preliminary survey is being made of the likely effects of the increased building programme
on the total manpower available for all forms of work. Building will not be the only claimant for the
resources released from the services and from war production and, in order to satisfy other needs,
adjustments may be necessary in the building programme.
552. After making some allowance for the needs of other industries, it is estimated that the labour
available for the domestic building industry can be increased by about 70 per cent, above the pre-war
demand. If a doubling of the size of the output of domestic building is to be achieved on the basis of a
70 per cent, increase in the size of the labour force, the implications are that :
(a) unemployment, both long-term and transitional, will have to be very considerably reduced.
This means that the programme of work will have to be planned so that men can move from
job to job without wasting time ;
(b) loss of time due to bad weather will have to be reduced as far as possible by increasing the
proportion of factory work and reducing field operations ;
(c) more efficient methods of organisation and construction will be needed ; and
(d) extensive training schemes will be essential, particularly if and as prefabrication is introduced


C. PRINCIPAL CAUSES OF INEFFICIENCY.
553. It is stated above that the building industry as a whole is not as efficient as it could be.
This remark applies principally to the field work in domestic construction. There is no particular reason
for thinking that factories producing building materials are less efficient than other factories, though
their productive capacity might be increased by an increase in standardisation and a steady flow of orders
so that advance planning of production becomes possible. In house building, the small scale and individual
nature of each contract has in the past prevented the application of the more efficient techniques which
have been developed for larger buildings ; the practice of private individuals buying separate blocks of
land has meant the erection of many separate cottages by small builders using old methods. On the other
hand, post-war government construction will principally be in groups of houses or large estates.
554. In view of the extreme shortage of houses, it should be emphasised that speed of erection
will become of paramount importance. The post-war housing programme will resemble the wartime
munitions programme in that, while economy will be a primary aim, economy of manpower and speed
of production will be equally if not more important.
555. Some of the reasons for past inefficiency in the house-building industry, particularly the
construction section, are :
(a) small contracts are not conducive to the use of up-to-date plant or an economical rotation
of trades ;
( b ) time lost between contracts or in moving from job to job eventually adds to the cost of
each contract ;
(c) time lost due to bad weather ;
( d ) delays in receipt of materials due to defects in supply and distribution methods ;
(e) inefficient and out-of-date building methods ; and
( f) inefficient organisation, including poor training, discontented labour and poor management.
Note.—The Report of the British Mission led by Alfred Bossom, M.P.,
on “ Methods of Building in the U.S.A.” outlines many causes of inefficiency
in the building industry in Great Britain. While not all are applicable to
Australia, they are most enlightening and should be considered in addition
to the above.
D. FACTORS TENDING TO INCREASE AND OPPOSE CHANGES IN THE
INDUSTRY
556. It will be helpful to examine methods of increasing efficiency in the building industry which
may bring about changes, and also to examine the opposing forces at work in the industry, factors which
tend to oppose changes.
557. The main factors tending to bring about changes in the building industry are :
(1) the magnitude of the post-war need and the size of the projected programme encourage
people to think in large-scale terms and bring to the building industry capital and enterprise
which would otherwise be put into other channels ;
(2) the government-sponsored programme means a guaranteed market. This will develop
construction companies and subsidiary undertakings for the manufacture of materials,
equipment and furniture ;
(3) the war-stimulated extension of factory methods should benefit building, commencing with
the manufacture of materials and equipment, and extending to prefabrication of components
later ;
(4) wartime introduction of modern earth-moving equipment should revolutionise site
preparation ;
(5) government controls can make possible more efficient use of resources and planning of
supply ;
(6) letting of large contracts for estate building will permanently affect the structure of the
industry ;
(7) dilution of skilled tradesmen during the war and the probable large numbers of post-war
trainees may tend to place emphasis on the development of forms of construction requiring
more unskilled labour ; and
(8) acceptance of the need for a scientific approach, including the establishment of the
Experimental Building Station (see paragraph 668).
558. The main factors tending to oppose changes in the building industry are :
(1) probable unwillingness of capital to enter the industry while governments are competing
in or controlling sections of the programme ;
(2) necessity to recommence, as a first step, building on the old footing due to the time it will
take to prepare new methods ;
(3) vested interest in certain existing materials which resist introduction of new methods; and
(4) widespread prejudice against government entry into or regulatjpn of the budding industry.


559. The extent and type of future development depends upon the relative strength of these
factors. In our opinion the stage is set for a radical change in production methods—a change which might
be described as similar to that which took place in the English textile industry at the time of the industrial
revolution, or to that which took place in the course of the Australian munitions production programme.
There are building technicians in this country sufficiently experienced and competent to plan and organise
house production in the time, on the scale, and at the price required, but we must beware of expecting
too much at first. The investigations of the Experimental Building Station, public and private organisations
and individuals, are expected to effect many changes and much progress in the industry.
E. PROPOSALS FOR INCREASING EFFICIENCY.
560. A number of suggested methods of increasing efficiency in the building industry are listed
below :
(1) introduction of extended training schemes for building tradesmen and other technical
personnel, not only in the immediate post-war period but as a permanent feature of the
industry. A close scrutiny is needed of the syllabus of each training scheme to ensure
that obsolete trade practices, which still characterise many professional and trade courses,
are eliminated;
(2) planning of materials supply;
(3) supply of capital by the government to individual builders or factories in order to facilitate
expansion;
(4) development of the supply of certain materials on a regional basis to meet the needs of the
building programme;
(5) encouragement of large-scale building by a policy of awarding contracts for complete housing
projects;
(6) bulk buying of materials and equipment;
(7) introduction of improved methods of construction and standardisation of materials and
equipment;
(8) registration of builders (see paragraphs 935-941) ; and
(9) use of existing government or government-sponsored factories to manufacture standardised
building units and equipment.
F. CONCLUSIONS.
561. Consideration of the position outlined in this Part shows clearly that large-scale planning
must be undertaken, and that in order to give effect to this there must be an increase in the size and
efficiency of the domestic building industry.
562. Accordingly, WE RECOMMEND that the Commonwealth Government sponsor an
investigation of the re-organisation of the domestic building industry with a view to increasing its efficiency
and size, and that it be assisted in this work by committees formed in each State.


Part X. Labour for Post-War Building.
SUMMARY : A. Pre-war supply of building labour.
B. Factors causing a change in the supply of building labour during war years.
C. Probable post-war demand for building labour.
(a) Demand in relation to the general problem of post-war allocation of resources
(b) Short-term demand.

D. Measures which should be taken to increase the post-war supply of building iabou,.
(a) Increase in effective labour supply.

(c) Increase in the supply of labour
A. PRE-WAR SUPPLY OF BUILDING LABOUR.
563. There are no satisfactory records of the number employed either in the building industry or
in building occupations at any time. The most satisfactory data are those obta:n:d by the 1933 Census
and the 1939 National Register. Both need care in interpretation. The Natirr.al Register figures, in
particular, require adjustment for failure to register and for excluded ages. On this basis, the number
in each occupation in the building industry at July u 1939, is estimated as :

564. It should be noted that these figures refer to the total number seeking employment in these
occupations. In addition to the total of 113,000, about 17,000 were employed in the building trades
outside the building industry ; at the 1933 Census 47,400 males were recorded as unemployed and, at
July, 1939, 16,000 males are estimated to have been unemployed due to insufficiency of work in the district,
wet weather, sickness or transition between jobs.
565. These figures indicate the number of men in the whole building industry in 1939 and, from
the point of view of housing, they require further analysis to show separately the proportion of this
building labour, which was employed in the construction of new dwellings and in repair and alteration of
dwellings. It is necessary to remember, in particular, that a considerable number of building tradesmen
are permanently employed on repairs in large industries. Present estimates suggest that probably
somewhere between 50,000 to 70,000 of the men engaged in the building industry were employed on
the construction of new dwellings and alterations and repairs of dwellings.
566. More recent data on the numbers in the building trades are contained in the C.R. 7 Census
taken in 1942. This is, however, of little value for the present purpose as so many persons were employed
in other than their normal occupations, and as members of the Allied Works Council in the building trades
were grouped under “ building ” and not under their particular trade.
B. FACTORS CAUSING A CHANGE IN THE SUPPLY OF BUILDING LABOUR
DURING WAR YEARS.
567. During the war the pre-war supply of building labour has been diminished by war casualties
and disablements and by normal deaths and retirements. Total losses from these causes may amount
to as much as 19,000 by July, 1945. At the same time many tradesmen have left the building industry
for other occupations, and some at least will not return. It seems probable that apprenticeships begun
during the war will not make up losses due to changing occupations, except in plumbing, where
apprenticeship has been high.


568. The size of the probable post-war building programme and a general government policy
of full employment will increase the effective labour supply and tend to offset the factors discussed above,
because loss of working time which in 1933 was more than 45 per cent, and fell to an immediate pre-war
minimum of about 14 per cent, in 1939, may be expected to decrease in the immediate post-war period
to about 8 per cent, to cover loss of working time due to wet weather, imperfect mobility and other
causes ; an allowance of 8 per cent, may not be sufficient for this purpose ; on the other hand, it may be
possible to reduce the loss of time due to wet weather by increasing the amount of work done under
factory conditions.
C. PROBABLE POST-WAR DEMAND FOR BUILDING LABOUR.
(a) Demand in Relation to the General Problem of Post-War Allocation of Resource
569. Throughout this discussion it is assumed, firstly, that the government will adhere to a policy
ensuring full employment after the war and, also, that a determined attempt will be made to construct
50,000 dwellings in the first post-war year, as approved by Cabinet in November, 1943, and to increase
that number thereafter.
570. It should be realised that the delayed demand for a large number of goods and the urge for
a higher standard of living will put heavy demands on the labour and materials available after the war.
In planning for this period, it must be decided how much of these limited supplies will be used for building,
and how much for other purposes ; in particular, what proportion of building resources will be used for
housing, and what proportion for schools, hospitals, factories and so on. This type of decision will
continue to arise after the worst of the housing shortage has been relieved, when the alternatives may
be a further rise in the general standard of housing or a switch to other building or even other production.
This is a decision which must depend on the general level of the national income, on public demand and
other various economic and political relationships.
(b) Short-Term Demand.
571. During the first post-war year, residential building will require sufficient labour to construct,
or have under construction, 50,000 dwellings, and, also, to effect urgent repairs and alterations. It may be
assumed that, during this first year, the dwellings will be almost entirely single dwelling units or attached
dwellings of medium size, and that repairs and alterations will be largely increased above the 1939 level.
The materials and labour position may make it impossible to build 50,000 dwellings and, at the same time,
carry out as large a repair programme as will be demanded in the first post-war year.
572. An estimate of the distribution of the housing programme according to the materials of the
outer walls has been included in Appendix VIII. It must, however, be borne in mind that post-war labour
requirements will vary according to the type of house, the efficiency of the labour force, materials used,
and methods of construction, all of which may differ after the war. It appears probable that between
35,000 and 45,000 additional men will be required for the domestic building programme (including urgent
repairs) contemplated for the first post-war years.
573. Moreover, in both the pre-war and immediate post-war periods it is estimated that new
dwelling construction accounted for and will account for about one-third of the total amount of labour
required in building occupations. The total amount required would include a large number of building
tradesmen normally employed in industries other than building ; including these, the total labour
requirements for housing, commercial and public building, additions, alterations, maintenance and
repairs is likely to rise about 140,000 by the second post-war year as compared with approximately I 13,000
available in the building industry in 1939. It has been already noted in paragraph 567 that this I 13,000
will have decreased during the war years.
574. The discussion above has been confined to manpower on the job. It should be pointed out,
however, that the building programme contemplated will require a considerable amount of factory
production to supply the fittings and equipment required.
(c) Long-Term Demand.
575. We have already stated that we consider that the housing programme should rise to 80,000
new dwellings a year and be tapered off towards the end of ten years to a programme sufficient for normal
additions and adequate replacements for obsolescence.
576. After the early post-war years the type of construction can be expected to change to include
a proportion of multi-storey dwellings, some larger dwellings and greater provision for community
facilities. Until more is known of the detailed type of construction contemplated and of the amount
of non-residential building to be undertaken, it is of little value to draw up detailed estimates of the labour
required for this programme. In particular, we know little of probable changes in construction methods.
It is, however, clear that training of the main types of tradesmen for the early post-war years can proceed
without fear of creating an over-supply in later years.
577. It is difficult to estimate now what the normal building rate will be after overcoming present
shortages. In the case of housing this demand will depend on:
(1) rate of natural increase in population and immigration ; and
(2) rate of obsolescence of existing dwellings.


578. The rate of obsolescence should be made the subject of a special stud/ which should cover
not only dwellings but, as far as possible, all buildings. A large number of our schools, for instance, were
built last century, and may require replacement during the next twenty years.
579. The size of the total building programme after overcoming present shortages will be
governed, inter alia , by :
(1) the size of the national income, /.e., whether the nation can afford permanently to allocate
to building a larger proportion of its resources than formerly ;
(2) building methods—improved building methods may allow a level of building much higher
than pre-war without a corresponding increase in building labour ; and
(3) the amount of financial assistance allocated by the Commonwealth and State Governments
to meet the needs and maintain a high standard of housing, schools, hospitals and other
public buildings.
580. We are of the opinion that the questions raised in this section should be considered as soon
as possible by the Commonwealth Planning Authority and the Commonwealth Housing Authority, or,
pending their establishment, by the Department of Post-War Reconstruction. It is desirable for a
building programme to be planned for many years ahead, even though any such plan may require frequent
revision.
D. MEASURES WHICH SHOULD BE TAKEN TO INCREASE THE POST-WAR
SUPPLY OF BUILDING LABOUR.
581. It is probably desirable to emphasise again at this point the extremely tentative nature of
the statistics quoted above, but to stress that it is valuable to gain some idea of the size of the problem
of adjusting the supplies of building labour and materials to the programme contemplated. The relation
between the supply and demand of labour on the estimates given shows a large deficiency in supply. The
basis of these figures is sufficiently sound for it to be clear that a gap of considerable size will exist between
supply and demand, yet it is of major importance that the proposed building programme and, in particular,
the domestic building programme should be achieved. There is thus urgent need for further information
and for positive measures to meet the position. Detailed recommendations cannot be made on the
basis of present information, and we urge that action should be taken immediately to assure :
(a) preparation of detailed housing programmes so that reasonable estimates may be made of
the type and amount of labour and materials required. Detailed estimates will also be
required of the needs of other sections of the building programme. These plans may have
to be modified in the light of shortages, and adjusted later to accord with investigations
of more economical methods of construction ; and
( b) investigation of the labour required for the manufacture of building materials and the
probable labour requirements for surveying sites and supplying public utilities.
582. This information will facilitate the planning of the post-war domestic building programme
but will not reduce the necessity to consider measures to equate the supply of building labour to the
needs of the post-war building industry. The main steps which can be taken may be divided into three :
(a) increase in effective labour supply by increasing mobility and reducing time lost by
unemployment from various causes;
(b) decrease in labour required per unit of construction by improved building methods ; and
(c) increase in supply of labour by increasing attractiveness of the occupation and by providing
facilities for training.
(a) Increase in Effective Labour Supply.
583. Possible methods of increasing the mobility of building labour and reducing time lost by
unemployment from various causes are :
(1) better dissemination of information of positions vacant by, for example, a central employment
agency, such as the present National Service Offices. The work of this agency might be
supplemented by the trades unions concerned;
(2) payment by the employer of costs of removal for married men willing to work for a stated
time in a new district;
(3) ensuring adequate accommodation for workers and families who transfer to new areas.
In cases where the transfer is temporary, consideration should be given to the use of
demountable houses for families and mobile housing with canteens for single persons;
(4) reduction in time lost between jobs ; and
(5) increase in amount of work done under factory conditions so as to reduce loss of time from
wet weather.
(b) Decrease in Labour Required Per Unit of Construction.
584. We have already stressed the need for immediate investigation by the Experimental Building
Station of more economical methods of construction, with which private enterprise is also likely to assist.
585. Organisation of building on mass production lines will also tend to decrease the labour
required per unit of construction. In this connection it is valuable to quote from the report of the
British Mission sent by the United Kingdom Government to the United States of America, led by Alfred
Bossom, M.P., on “ Methods of Building in the United States of America ” :
“ As a result of a preliminary examination of the actual cost per cubic foot of certain specimen
buildings in this country and the U.S.A., we have concluded that before the present war the relative
cost of building might be fairly expressed by the figures shown on lines I and 2 of Table A, below.


The average wage rates in Great Britain .urnished by the Ministry of Labour and the wage rates in
the United States, given in the ‘ Survey of Current Business,’ are also compared below, together with
the cost of certain important building materials.
“ Table A. Relative Costs and Wages.
“ British figures are standardised at 100. Rate of exchange assumed at $4.68 to the £1 (the
average for January-August, 1939).
Great Britain. U.S.A.
Cost of building ... ... ... ... ... 100 75-175
Hourly wage rates —craftsmen ... ... ... 100 350-380
Hourly wage rates —labourers ... ... ... 100 215-245
Cost of materials (excluding timber) ... ... 100 I 10-160
‘ In the above table the rate of exchange has been taken as the average rate for January-
August, 1939, namely, $4.68 to the £. A higher sterling rate might have been more appropriate
had we been concerned to make an exact comparison in terms of purchasing power. It will be seen
that while the American craftsmen’s hourly rate is fully 3| times that of the craftsmen in this country,
the cost of certain specimen buildings was not greater to the same extent. It should be noted,
however, that some of the specimen buildings for which we obtained costs were completed when
activity in the American building industry was seriously depressed.”
(Paragraphs 61 and 62.)
(c) Increase in the Supply of Labour.
586. Although we hope that improved building methods will be introduced in a reasonably short
period, it is still clear that the housing shortage cannot be overcome without a substantial increase in the
supply of building labour. Therefore, we urge that consideration should be given to the following :
(1) it is essential to proceed as soon as possible with the training of more technicians. Women
might be encouraged to enter certain sections of the building industry, particularly if the
proportion of work done in factories is increased. Training should be decentralised so
that those in country areas may be trained and employed nearer their normal place of
residence. Training can be undertaken immediately labour is available, though detailed
plans cannot be made until further information is secured. The size of the proposed
building programme is so great that over-training in the early period is almost impossible
under any reasonable allocation between trades. It should be pointed out that the additional
number now trained is likely to find permanent employment provided a government
policy of full employment can be maintained;
(2) the need for additional building tradesmen should be considered in relation to the
re-employment and re-establishment of defence personnel ; a training scheme is now in
operation and should be extended as personnel is discharged and facilities become available.
It should be noted that all government training plans are taking into consideration the needs
for permanence of employment;
(3) immigration policy should encourage the entry of building labour into Australia. It will,
however, be difficult to achieve this on a large scale, since most countries will wish to retain
their skilled tradesmen for their own post-war building programmes;
(4) investigation might be made into the possibility of shortening the period of apprenticeship
in some trades. Particular consideration should be given to the possibility of full-time
technical school training ; and
(5) it is necessary to make the building trades a more attractive field of employment. The
following suggestions should be considered :
(i) payment of weekly wages instead of hourly rates —this would obviate broken time;
(ii) the reduction of waiting time between jobs—to assist achieve this a central employment
agency should be notified by the employer of the probable time of completion of each
job so that it could allot further work to the men before they actually complete their
present work;
(iii) the institution of paid annual holidays in all States;
(iv) as far as possible employment should be organised so as to reduce travelling time.
This might be achieved by a central employment agency with full information on all
work offering. In general, there would be a preference for work near home ; and
(v) facilities should be available for re-training building labour if methods of construction
change and so cause a shift in demand for different types of building labour. Since it
seems probable that, within the next decade, there may be a radical alteration in
building methods, facilities of this kind will be necessary to give security in employment
as well as to complete the building programme.

Part XI. Building Construction and Materials Required.
SUMMARY: A. Requirements of building materials.
B. Use of new building materials.
C. Problem of reducing building costs.
(a) General.
(b) Suggested methods of investigating building costs with a view to reduction.
(c) Relation of construction to cost.
A. REQUIREMENTS OF BUILDING MATERIALS.
587. The problem of housing from the point of building materials may be stated as follows :
(a) the availability of material of particular types in the areas in which building is required;
(b) adaptation of the form of construction used to suit the type of materials available ; and
(c) adaptation of methods of construction so as to economise in the use of materials and increase
the speed of construction.
588. It is impossible at this stage to estimate at all accurately the location of post-war building
or the forms of construction which will be used. Nevertheless, it is necessary that some preliminary
estimates should be made with the object of revealing shortages, which will need to be filled and to which
it will be necessary to adapt the building programme. In Appendix VIII, we have included an approximate
estimate of the distribution of a building programme of 50,000 dwellings for the first post-war year.
These figures are based on pre-war domestic building construction with an allowance for known trends
in construction and a slight increase in the allotment to the smaller States. It should be stressed that
this estimate is intended to apply to the first post-war year only and that, even in this regard, it shout
be considered as tentative and should be subject to revision. It will also be necessary to provide in the
estimates for urgent additions and repairs to existing dwellings.
589 On this basis it is possible to work out the approximate quantities of different building
materials which will be required. We do not consider it likely that there will be shortages of such items
as bricks, cement, and aggregate for concrete, if the required labour be available.
590. Timber, on the other hand, will be in short supply. Australian native timbers supplied
about two-thirds of the national requirements for all purposes before the war, the balance being imported
from Canada, United States of America, New Zealand and, to a lesser degree, several other countries.
The production of local timber for building after the war will require to be greater than before the war,
in order to supply the estimated post-war needs. The demand for timber will be augmented by the
increased quantity of furniture required for new dwellings and, also, to supply the demand banked up
by wartime restrictions. Local supply of timber for housing will depend on a number of factors, such as
manpower, other uses of timber, and the suitability of the timber produced for domestic building.
591. It will also be necessary to import timber to a much greater degree than was done before
the war if the building programme envisaged is to be carried out, unless very radical changes in construction
and materials are made.
592. Timber used in building may be divided into two groups: sawn structural and finishing timbers.
593. Structural timbers do not take long to produce, but finishing timbers must be well seasoned.
The usual method of seasoning is to air dry and then kiln dry.
594. Seasoned timbers of Australian origin are used for house building, furniture making and
manv other purposes The drying kilns are limited in number ; the Commission considers there will
be a X heavy demand for kiln-driid timber in the post-war period, and urges that steps should be taken as
soon as possibTe to use existing kiln space to capacity and build new kilns m suitable locations.
595 The position regarding importation of timber after the war is not known. It is certain
that there* will heavy demands for timber in all countries where war has actually been waged.
develop timber trading, but at present this is only problematical.
cot VVE RECOMMEND that action be taken to make available sufficient labour to cut and season
the Commonwealth Timber Controller.


597. There are a number of other items where we consider shortages may develop if action is
not taken during the war period to prepare for their production. These items are listed below :
Galvanised sheet iron—flat and corrugated. Washing troughs.
Asbestos cement —flat and corrugated (depending Sinks.
on supplies of crude asbestos). Lock-sets.
Galvanised water pipes. W.C. pedestals.
Electric meter boxes and switchboards. Stoves.
Electric fittings and equipment. Wash boilers.
Sheet glass. Fly wire.
Paint (all types). Linoleum.
Basins. Blinds.
Baths.
598. Certain items now used for war purposes and therefore in short supply which, it is assumed,
will become immediately available for domestic construction at the end of the war, are listed below :
Copper piping. Screws.
Sash cords. Bolts and nuts.
Plumbing fittings. Sheet lead.
Sisal fibre. Chain wire.
599. We consider that the probable shortage of many materials and fittings should be regarded
a?i a basis for investigating the production of building materials in relation to working out details for
housing programmes in each State. In some cases it may be possible to convert war factories to the
production of certain items required. If it appears that the requirements of particular building materials
cannot be met under present conditions, we consider that investigations should proceed rapidly to increase
the production of building materials or to change the methods of construction of dwellings.
B. USE OF NEW BUILDING MATERIALS.
600. It is unlikely that any major change in building construction methods will take place during
the early post-war period. We consider, however, that a major change is essential. The domestic
building industry has made little advance during the last twenty years ; it is partly because of this that
cost of production has remained so high that the low wage earner cannot afford a good standard house.
We consider, therefore, that it is important to investigate new building materials and new methods of
construction, particularly the wider use of concrete. The Victorian Housing Commission and a number
of private firms have been experimenting with concrete construction for domestic building, and the
results suggest that this type of construction is likely to be greatly extended in the near future.
601. Although research into new methods of prefabrication and new building materials, leading
to new types of construction, is proceeding in the hands of private firms and a few government
organisations, we consider it of major importance that investigations of this type should be co-ordinated
and extended, so that they may cover also the mass production of sections of houses and domestic
equipment, and, as in our First Interim Report, WE RECOMMEND that a building research station should
be established without delay. (Following on the previous recommendation an Experimental Building
Station has been established.)
602. Also, WE RECOMMEND that in order to develop new methods of construction, the
Commonwealth Housing Authority, soon after its establishment, should inaugurate competitions for the
following :
(1) dwelling constructed principally of concrete;
(2) dwelling constructed of any material or combination of materials;
(3) standard furniture and fittings;
(4) standard joinery;
(5) electrical wiring ; and
(6) plumbing.
We have included in Appendix XV suggestions regarding conditions for these competitions.
C. PROBLEM OF REDUCING BUILDING COSTS.
(a) General.
603. During the past few years, transition from hand work in the field to machine work in the
shop has been carried far enough to demonstrate the practicability of factory production of housing parts ;
therefore, cost is bound up to some extent in the re-organisation in the building industry that may be
necessary to meet new methods of construction.
605. The rise in cost of building since 1939 has been caused, to some extent, by partially trained
men working in the building trade, increased cost of materials, and the delays occasioned by the shortage
of supplies and by difficulties in replacements.


605. To bring about reduced costs and at the same time improve the quality of construction,
certain re-organisation and development within the building industry itself will be necessary, but this
alone cannot be expected to reduce costs unless it is governed by some factors outside actual construction,
e.g., by concentrating on reducing the cost of individual items. Building costs will probably fluctuate
during the transition period at the conclusion of the war, until conditions become normal or stabilised.
(b) Suggested Methods of Investigating Building Costs with a view to a Reduction.
606. A schedule of building costs could be compiled by the accepted method of combining the
cost of materials and labour as a unit for each specific item of a building, which would form a guide for
comparison of unit costs in each area. Appendix XVI indicates schedules covering nearly all materials
and labour that would be used in domestic construction. These schedules are priced for various capital
cities. The prices indicated are approximate, but they are submitted to indicate the basis for this method
of assessing building costs, and ultimately of attacking them item by item with the view to reducing their
costs. The prices quoted have been extracted from builders’ priced bills of quantities for work carried
out by contract in each State.
607. The priced schedule rate for each particular item would be reached by agreement between
the Commonwealth and each State Housing Authority. By referring to costs in the schedules it may be
disclosed that it would be inadvisable and uneconomical to build a dwelling of a particular material ; in
this case a study of the materials and costs in the schedule would reveal the most suitable and economical
form of construction to adopt. With the periodical examination, say, each three months, and with
necessary revision to the schedules the cost per square foot of domestic construction could be determined.
This priced schedule for each particular item (labour and materials) combined as a unit, could be regarded
as an index of construction costs. This work should be carried out by the Commonwealth Housing
Authority in co-operation with the Experimental Building Station and with close liaison with each State
Housing Authority, and thus enable the subsidy for dwellings of the approved standard to be determined
(see paragraph 508).
608. The table in Appendix XVII comprises a list of materials used in the average dwelling,
together with their approximate costs in Melbourne. This price schedule of costs, together with similar
lists from all States, would also be used as an indication, in conjunction with schedule rates, for controlling
the price of materials, and it is suggested that the cost of these items could also be attacked independently
with a view to reducing prices by means which would be determined after investigation.
609. The schedule rates referred to above are for the capital cities only, and it is suggested that
an increase on a percentage basis would be necessary, in accordance with the respective distances to
areas outside these cities and the variation of conditions in such areas.
•
(c) Relation of Construction to Cost.
610. New methods of construction and new uses of existing materials should play an important
part in the ultimate reduction of building costs.
611. The importance of giving every assistance to aid the functioning of the Experimental Building
Station cannot be too strongly stressed. It will bring exact science to bear on the old rule of thumb
methods of the past. The investigation of new materials and new methods of construction and their
correlation to the building industry are bound up with long-range planning, but new uses of existing
materials may be woven into construction in the early stages of the housing programme.
612. The erection of experimental buildings, even to the extent of complete houses, either at
the Station itself or at selected locations agreed with the relative State Housing Authority, will be essential
to prove the value of new methods and, on the other hand, to find structural and aesthetic faults. Such
experimentation will gradually pave the way for large-scale application of methods of construction, which
have been proved successful both from scientific and practical viewpoints.
613. A major problem will be to have new ideas, which appear to differ to a marked degree from
accepted trade practice, accepted by the public ; this angle will have to be handled very carefully, since
only by general approval can the value of a new idea be fully exploited, whether it is a new form of
construction or a new material.
614. As an illustration of the way in which new methods of construction could assist in reducing
building costs, a comparison can be made with past methods of concrete domestic construction, where
external walls were often 12-inch cavity walls or 7-inch solid walls ; it is now quite possible to construct
2-inch thick ribbed walls of concrete designed to be structurally sound, the actual quantity of
material used being less than half that formerly used. The lesser thickness of walls would represent
a considerable saving in the overall area, and the reduced volume of material used must necessarily reduce
the labour employed. Problems of this kind should be investigated in the endeavour to find better,
cheaper and speedier methods of building houses.

(f) Recommendation.
L. Standards for new methods of house construction.
A. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.
615. In the past, housing standards have been greatly influenced by building costs. Pre-war
building practice often provided too low a standard. We consider that any government-sponsored
dwelling, whether for families, pensioners, single persons or others, should provide more than mere
shelter. It should form the background for satisfactory mental and physical development, and for a full
social life.
616. The average wage-earner with a large family in many cases has been unable to purchase a
house ; he has also found it difficult to rent a suitable home, as many landlords have been unwilling to let
houses of good standard to a person with children ; consequently, in many cases, he has been forced to
rent a sub-standard house, and rear his family in unhygienic and unsatisfactory conditions.
617. These deplorable circumstances (which are remediable) have been in our opinion, one of
the major factors in the limitation of families. This Commission feels it has a responsibility to point out
that if the needs of families are considered, by providing houses of a good standard of design and equipment
(either for purchase or for renting) at a weekly cost within their capacity to pay, it will have a beneficial
effect on the birthrate. In the post-war period there will be an unprecedented opportunity to improve
housing and it should not be missed.
618. The preceding considerations mean that the design of the dwelling should provide for the
following principles :
(a) adequate light and ventilation;
(b) adequate sleeping accommodation to provide healthy conditions;
(c) adequate living space so as to avoid the frictions which arise from overcrowding;
(d) adequate unbuilt-on land for general use by the occupants ; and
(e) adequate and well-designed living space with modern equipment for all functions, so as
to reduce work and eliminate household drudgery.


619. It would be possible to elaborate these principles ; nevertheless, this brief list gives an
indication of the foundation on which we have based our standards for government-sponsored dwellings.
There are, however, limiting factors which we have had to bear in mind—the housing shortage is so acute
that in the immediate post-war period the aim must be to erect as large a number of good standard dwellings
as possible, and this means that the building resources used for each dwelling should be kept to the
minimum consistent with a good standard.
620. WE RECOMMEND that the standards for size of allotment, site coverage, accommodation
and equipment, set out in Appendix X, Division (ii), should be the standard for government-sponsored
dwellings.
B. HOUSING STANDARDS A CONDITION OF GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE.
621. As stated above, this Commission considers that all government-sponsored housing should
be of a good standard of construction and equipment. WE RECOMMEND that building of government-
sponsored dwellings should be restricted to the standards set out in Appendix X, Division (ii), during
the early post-war period, while the housing shortage is acute and building resources are limited. These
standards are such that the desires and requirements of any reasonable citizen should be satisfied. They
are not rigid and should be revised periodically to meet changing requirements and conditions of living.
622. No Government-sponsored housing should be of less than the approved standard, and, in
particular, where financial assistance is given it should be a condition of that assistance that this standard
is maintained. We consider, also, that no government-financed housing should greatly exceed this
standard ; it would be unwarrantable to use government financial assistance to provide a higher standard
than that required for reasonable living. At the same time, it is reasonable to make some provision for
the individual requirements of home purchasers —therefore, WE RECOMMEND that all government-
sponsored housing should be not less than the approved standard, and housing for purchase may exceed
it to a percentage of the total cost to be determined from time to time by agreement between the
Commonwealth and State Housing Authorities ; this percentage will vary with the local conditions in
the area concerned.
C. STANDARDS OF HABITATION.
623. Previous sections of this Part have dealt with standards of construction for new dwellings.
It is not, however, sufficient to ensure that only new dwellings erected should be of good standard ; action
is necessary to bring any existing sub-standard dwelling to a reasonable standard or have it demolished.
It is not practicable, for obvious reasons, to insist on the same standard for existing dwellings, as has been
recommended for new dwellings, but a standard sufficient to secure satisfactory health and living conditions
should be mandatory. We have; therefore, included in Appendix X, Division (i), standards of habitation
which we regard as the minimum, and to which all existing dwellings should conform or be declared
undesirable or unfit for human habitation.
624. In all States, the legislature has given power, principally to local government authorities,
to order repair or demolition of a building unsafe for human habitation ; such power, however, has not
been satisfactorily exercised ; we appreciate there must be some latitude in respect of demolition in
the present abnormal housing shortage, but we have had evidence of, and have seen cases of, serious
neglect in this regard in pre-war days.
625. In South Australia, the Housing Improvement Act, 1940-43, empowers the local board (of
health), where it is satisfied a house does not conform with regulations as to standard of houses desirable
and fit for human habitation, to declare such house undesirable for human habitation or unfit for human
habitation, and require the owner either to carry out work as notified in writing to make it comply'With
the regulations, or, if it is impracticable to do so, to demolish it ; if the local board neglects; such action
the South Australian Housing Trust, if satisfied that the house is sub-standard, and, after consulting with
the board, may by notice in writing require the board within a specified time t 0 ™ ake ' ! * d .heTrust k
prescribed in respect of the house, and, if the board omits to comply with any such notice, *he
empowered to take the same action in respect of the house as that which may have been taken by the
board. No declaration, however, shall be made in respect of any sub-standard house unless at the time
or within three months before the declaration was made, such house was let to some person at a r .
626. Any owner or mortgagee aggrieved by a declaration may within a month thereof appeal
therefrom to the local court of full jurisdiction ; the decision of the court is final and conclusive.
627. Provision is also made that if an owner satisfies the Housing Trust that he would not b>e able
without suffering undue hardship to provide the money necessary to make the house comply with the
notice the Truslfmay at his reauest make him an advance for such purpose, and such advance with interest
thereon becomes a charge on the land on which the said house is situate, and with the consent of any
registered mortgagee a first charge on the said land.
628. In Victoria, the Slum Reclamation and Housing Act makes provision! f °\'
Commission to have houses unfit for human habitation either re-conditioned or demolished and in
defauk to do the work itself and recover from the owner ; it also empowers the Common to make
advances to re-condition houses and such advances with interest thereon to be a first charge on tne iana
on which the house k situate. In both South Australia and Victoria, payable
any moneys expended by the housing authority by process of law or by attachment of the P Y
by the occupier.


629 There is a further provision in the Housing Improvement Act, 1940-43 (South Australia),
whereby the South Australian Housing Trust is empowered to control rentals of sub-standard houses
where they are deemed and declared by the Trust to be undesirable for human habitation or unfit for
human habitation. Under this provision, the Trust may classify the house and fix the maximum rental,
which shall be uniform for houses of similar condition and accommodation in the same locality, after
taking into account the accommodation provided by the house, its state of repair and general condition ;
the rental so fixed continues until such time as the house is brought up to the required standard and is
usually an uneconomic one, thus compelling prompt action by the owner. This control of rents also
extends to parts of houses, and also furnished houses. Provision is made for any owner or registered
mortgagee aggrieved to appeal against a declaration.
630. We are of the opinion that legislation should be enacted in all States of the Commonwealth
similar to that existing in South Australia (and to a similar extent in Victoria) in regard to the
reconditioning, demolition and control of rents of sub-standard houses, except that owner-occupied
houses be included and that any advance to recondition a sub-standard house should be a first charge on
the land, and accordingly WE RECOMMEND that, in regard to improvement of housing conditions,
whether such housing be owner-occupied or rented, and be in city, town or rural areas, each State should
enact legislation :
(a) prescribing standards of habitation as set out in Appendix X, Division (i), to be enforced
by local government authorities and prescribing the means of such enforcement ; and
( b ) empowering the State Housing Authority to :
(i) supervise the actions of local government authorities with respect to having dwellings,
not complying with the standards of habitation in (a), declared undesirable for human
habitation or unfit for human habitation ;
(ii) in default by a local government authority take the prescribed action itself ;
(jjj) classify and fix the rental for sub-standard houses, including parts of houses and furnished
houses until they comply with the standards of habitation in (a) ; and
(iv) make an advance to an owner of a sub-standard house who would not be able without
suffering undue hardship to provide the money necessary to make such house comply
with the standards of habitation in (a), and such an advance with interest to be a first
charge on the land on which the house is situate.
631. WE RECOMMEND that the regulations (Procedural and Forms) under Slum Reclamation
and Housing Act of March, 1940, of the Housing Commission, Victoria, could be used as a basis to form
that section of the administration which would be necessary to give effect to the Standards of Habitation
set out in Appendix X, Division (i) ; this would apply to serving notices for demolition or requiring
occupier to vacate a house, closing a street, etc.
D. COMMONWEALTH UNIFORM BUILDING CODE.
632. Housing standards are affected by building regulations which vary considerably in different
States and parts of States. Much evidence has been given on the need for raising the standards generally
by a uniform building code which would operate throughout Australia with suitable variations to suit*
local and climatic conditions. We feel that the maintenance of a good standard of dwelling by all
government housing authorities will, in time, have the effect of raising building standards throughout
the Commonwealth. Nevertheless, WE RECOMMEND that a Commonwealth Uniform Building Code
should be framed. Observance of this code when adopted would be binding for government-financed
housing and related buildings, and should also be submitted to all States and local government authorities
with the objective of securing its general acceptance.
633. The task of the compilation, revision and co-ordination of a building code requires
considerable research, and is a work of great magnitude. In Victoria, the compilation of a draft set of new
building regulations took a number of years. There are other instances of the long periods of time taken
to compile codes of this kind, therefore, we have not attempted to include a building code in this
report, but we stress the need for a uniform building code. WE RECOMMEND that for the transition
period (where not covered by standards set out in Appendix X, Division (ii) ) the regulations which are
operating at present in respective States, and which are approved of by the State Housing Authority
and agreed to by the Commonwealth Housing Authority, should be used until they are superseded by a
Commonwealth Uniform Building Code.
634. This code would be compiled in sections and, as each section was approved by a Committee
(recommended in paragraph 636), on which there would be representation from each State, it would be
forwarded to the respective State Housing Authorities, and, for government-sponsored housing, would
supersede that particular section of the existing regulations.
635. The code mentioned in the preceding paragraph would embody minimum requirements, but
allowance would be made for diverse conditions throughout the Commonwealth.
636. WE RECOMMEND that the Commonwealth Uniform Building Code be framed by a part-
time permanent standing committee of technical experts, including representation from each State,
appointed by the Commonwealth Housing Authority. It would probably be convenient for the State
representation to vary with the subject under discussion by the Committee.


637. This Committee would be guided by and would co-ordinate the work of the following
bodies :
(a) Experimental Building Station.
(b) Council for Scientific and Industrial Research ; and
(c) Standards Association of Australia.
Other technical research bodies, both government and private, would be consulted where necessary.
Wherever possible, the Standards Association of Australia codes should be accepted.
E. SIZE OF ALLOTMENT AND SITE COVERAGE.
638. In recommending the minimum size of allotment for new subdivisions, we have considered
that persons desiring single-unit dwellings are mostly families who need an allotment large enough to
provide reasonable playing space for young children, and space for garden, as well as for other uses, such
as drying clothes. Those, who do not require an area suitable for all these purposes, would be better
housed in attached dwelling units with a smaller garden area, or in multi-storey dwellings. On the other
hand, we are convinced that the large allotments in many subdivisions in Australia are often neglected,
and frequently become a burden to the occupant, as well as adding to the cost of utilities. Although a
quarter-acre allotment has been provided in many towns, we feel that this is too large for the average
family. The minimum area of allotment recommended is set out in Appendix X, Division (ii).
639. In the case of multi-storey dwellings, the important factor is not only the size of the site,
but the amount of the site which is covered by the building. It has, therefore, been agreed that the
siting of all dwellings above two storeys in height should be considered in relation to density, angles of
light and orientation. This will avoid lack of sunlight and restricted circulation of air and, to a large
extent, ensure provision of space for recreation (see paragraph 233).
F. ACCOMMODATION, FLOOR AREAS AND CEILING HEIGHTS OF GOVERNMENT-
SPONSORED DWELLINGS.
640. After giving due thought to the general considerations listed at the beginning of this Part,
we have recommended accommodation, floor areas and ceiling heights for government-sponsored
dwellings ; these are set out in Appendix X, Division (ii).
(a) Occupancy Standard.
641. It was agreed that the accommodation to be provided in any dwelling must be directly
related to the number of intended occupants. The basis, adopted for calculating the number of occupants,
is that all adults and children eight years old and over shall count as one person, children between eight
years and one year of age count as half, children under one year of age do not count. No two persons
of the opposite sex eight years of age and over, not husband and wife, should occupy the same bedroom ;
the age for sex separation of children, which is less than common overseas practice, has been determined
after considering the opinions of various medical and health authorities.
642. The recommended standards are the result of considerable investigation. Three main
factors have been taken into consideration :
(1) health, e.g., cubic feet of air space per person, ventilation and sex separation;
(2) sociological, e.g., space for living conditions, privacy, recreation ; and
(3) economic, e.g., cost in relation to size of house.
643. Although scientific data was gathered on the above subjects the final judgment was made
in terms of human needs, many of which are not definable by any formula.
644. On the question of space there is little value in laying down a standard applicable to the
total area of the house, without specifying the minimum area of the various rooms ; therefore, we have
laid down both, the total floor area in a dwelling being in relation to the size of the family, subject to
minimum areas for particular rooms. The standards of space are specified in terms of floor area because
we are satisfied that, given a minimum ceiling height, the essential requirements are adequate floor space
and ventilation.
645. The bedrooms are laid down on specific sizes because they are the only rooms^ which are
inhabited for sufficiently long period to allow standards of space per person to be logically applied.
Living, dining and kitchen areas are grouped together and stated in one area to allow flexibility of sub-
division to suit individual needs.
( b ) Standard Room Sizes.
646. Allowance has been made in the total floor areas for reasonable variations in planning to
introduce flexibility of design and planning to meet the needs or reasonable desires of all sections of the
community. Allowance has been made for verandahs, porches, passages and other functional areas.
647. The full use of the allowable percentages above the total floor area, as indicated in Appendix
X, Division (ii), is discretionary, not mandatory.
648. It will be noted that the standard recommended for the second and third bedroom, namely,
120 square feet, is in excess of the minimum area laid down by many housing authorities, which is usually
about 80 square feet. The increased area would provide double accommodation instead of single at very
little extra cost ; this in many cases would obviate the necessity of providing the extra bedroom, and
would guard against the crowding of two persons into a single room, and further, the second an t ir
bedrooms, being of equal size, will assist standardisation of room sizes, which is an important factor i n
designing on a unit basis,


649. It was agreed that the smallest single dwelling-unit to be erected in a government-financed
housing programme should be sufficient to accommodafe' four persons. Single dwelling units for less
than this number are not economically practicable. Appendix X, Division (ii), contains standards for
multi-storey dwellings and attached dwelling units, as well as for single dwelling units. We consider
that it is desirable for some attached and some multi-storey dwellings to be included in most housing
projects. These buildings will cause variation in the planning of the area, and will cater for the needs of
a considerable portion of the community, such as single persons, married couples without children, or
those whose children have left home, and persons only temporarily resident in the area. During the
immediate post-war period it may be desirable to consider erecting a proportion of multi-storey dwellings
since, to some extent, they will use different resources from the single dwelling units, and will thus tend
to provide a higher total domestic building programme than might otherwise be possible.
650. Certain overseas authorities state that no dwelling unit of less than three bedrooms should
be provided. In Australia there is a real demand for single dwelling units with only two bedrooms as
well as those with three bedrooms. In order to prevent later overcrowding, however, it is desirable that
in all cases dwellings for home purchase should be designed so that additions can be made with the minimum
structural alterations as the family needs increase. In the case of dwellings for renting, administration
should provide for transfer of a family to another dwelling to meet the family s needs in accordance with
the occupancy standard laid down by us. The housing needs of any family fluctuate with the number
and ages of the children. It is important to stress this element of flexibility in any project for dwellings
for renting.
(c) Room Arrangement.
651. Although standards of space have been recommended as mandatory for government-
sponsored housing there are certain necessary qualities, such as privacy and quietness, which cannot be
laid down because they depend upon planning of room arrangement. In all planning, therefore, the
following principles should be taken into consideration :
(1) rooms should be properly related to daylight and sunlight and planned to reduce noise as
much as possible;
(2) rooms should be planned to allow for the convenient placing of furniture and as far as
possible for the standard widths of floor coverings. Lack of provision of blank unbroken
walls for placing of furniture has been a bad fault in many otherwise well-planned houses
in the past ; and
(3) the placing of openings in rooms requires careful consideration according to climatic
conditions.
(d) Houses for Large Families.
652. It will be noted that no dwelling with more than three bedrooms is shown in the standards
recommended by us for government-sponsored dwellings. We consider that greater flexibility is
provided by maintaining the three-bedroom dwelling as a maximum and providing additional utility
space and sleep-out verandahs for families where more accommodation is required. This is not regarded
as a rigid standard and it may be desirable to modify it as the shortage of houses diminishes. A sleep-out
verandah would also cost less than an additional room or rooms and, while finance should not be a final
determining factor, it should be borne in mind.
(e) Adaptation of Housing Standards to Climate.
653. The standards recommended apply mainly to temperate climates. This limitation was
unavoidable since practically no detailed work has been carried out in Australia on the adaptation of
housing standards to climate. We consider that one of the main disabilities of Australian housing, in
the past, has been the lack of any attempt to adapt the type of housing to the climate of the area in which
it is to be erected. Attention need only be drawn to the contrast between the type of housing in use
in the northern parts of Australia and the type used by the white population in Malaya and the East Indies.
Appendix XIX illustrates typical designs for both tropical and sub-tropical houses planned to suit Australian
conditions.
654. We consider that the Commonwealth Housing Authority should sponsor a detailed
investigation of this subject, which will result in the division of Australia into climatic zones according to
temperature, rainfall, humidity and other factors (see Appendix XX* sheet P.G.3). This should be followed
by experimentation into the most suitable type of housing for each area. In this regard good work has
already been done by the Queensland Tropical Housing Committee which was set up in 1942 to investigate
tropical housing, and is now considering the erection of experimental dwellings in selected towns.
(f) Ceiling Heights.
655. There is considerable variation of opinion regarding ceiling heights. A few years ago a
12 feet high ceiling was not uncommon. The standard recommended by this Commission is 9 feet. We
feel that, as a result of investigation and research, a minimum ceiling height of 8 feet may be established,
for the following reasons :
(1) economy in building costs;
(2) lower ceiling enables window openings to be carried up to full height more easily;
Note.—This obviates pockets of still air, a common feature where
there is a space above the heads of windows.
(3) economy in the height of built-in presses and cupboards;


(4) improvement in natural lighting;
(5) saving in cost will assist to permit insulating material to be placed above the ceiling joists
so as to reduce the room temperature ; and
(6) reduction in cost of room heating.
(g) Garages.
656. Many of the occupants in government-sponsored housing schemes may require garage
accommodation. The possibility of an expansion in the use of motor cars must be envisaged, and in
planning government housing, space should be provided therefor either on individual allotments or as
centrally placed lock-up garages.
( h ) General Storage.
657. Our observations have made it clear that there is a general lack of storage facilities in most
pre-war houses. There is need for some space for storing articles of household equipment, such as
prams, sewing machines, travelling trunks and garden tools. In the absence of adequate storage space
these articles are usually left about in odd corners and contribute to general untidiness and additional
work.
658. Often the occupant of a house, feeling the need for storage space, has erected a shed in his
backyard without regard to the general design of the house and generally of a poor and temporary nature.
These sheds cumulatively have often spoilt the character of the whole neighbourhood.
659. Therefore, we have recommended in our standards, that space should be available for a
utility room in every government-sponsored house. Such a room is made mandatory in houses of three
bedrooms ; in addition we consider that outbuildings should be designed to harmonise with the dwelling.
G. REFRIGERATION AND HOT-WATER SERVICE.
(a) Refrigeration.
660. We are of the opinion that refrigerators are essential in all parts of Australia, and consider
that they should be installed in every dwelling unit. We have refrained from recommending their
inclusion in the minimum standard of government-sponsored dwelling units only because we are
uncertain as to whether it will be possible, in the immediate post-war period, for Australia to produce
sufficient refrigerators at a satisfactory price. The manufacture of sufficient refrigerators at a reasonable
cost is being investigated, and we are hopeful, from information afforded to us, that this investigation
will establish that it will be possible to include refrigerators in the standard of government-sponsored
dwelling units. We consider that if the supply of refrigerators is insufficient for all dwellings they
should be provided first in tropical and sub-tropical areas, in rural areas and in country towns where
high temperatures are experienced. We have, however, recommended that space should be provided
for refrigerators in all government-sponsored dwellings.
(b) Hot Water Service.
661. We consider that a hot water service should be included in government-sponsored dwelling
units as soon as practicable, but., at present, the cost, especially the operating cost, is considered to be
beyond the capacity of the low income group. Therefore, this Commission suggests that it should be the
subject of research by the Experimental Building Station. Consideration should be given also to the
heating plant in closely settled areas being located centrally and hot water reticulated to individual
dwelling units.
H. STANDARDISATION.
662. In the past, many houses have been built from standard plans. The method usually adopted
is for a housing authority to have a number of standardised plans for selection by the applicant. This
often results in the selection of a house which is unsuitable for the site.
663. During the past few years, people have become more conscious of the value of light and air.
In the planning of a modern home, every effort should be made by the designer to obtain the utmost
value of controlled sunlight in temperate zones, and to avoid the intensity of heat by means of shade and
through-ventilation in sub-tropical and tropical zones.
664. Juggling standard plans to suit all points of the compass is not satisfactory, being only a
“ hit or miss ” method. Any method that could enable pre-selection of standard plans to suit varying
solar aspects encountered in sites is a desirable objective to enable mass construction of houses.
665. To some people “standard room sizes ’’ will suggest rows of dwellings exactly alike and
all probably ugly. This type of housing has been frequently perpetrated by the “spec” builder.
Sometimes he avoids exact similarity by decorating each dwelling with a variation in the way of ornament.
666. It is suggested that an approach should be on the lines of standardisation of components of
houses, such as kitchens, bathrooms and laundries. These components could be planned to give variations
in designs. Before these components are put into production they should be subjected to exhaustive
research to evolve designs that would result in the minimum of physical and mental fatigue for the
housewife.


667. The standardisation of sizes of all materials, details and fittings would be a definite step in
the direction of reducing building costs. We note with interest the trend towards modular standardisation
in the United States of America, set out in “ Methods of Building in the U.S.A., the report of a Mission
appointed by the Ministry of Works, Britain, which reads :
“ A more recent development is the launching of a scheme for designing units and equipment
so that all sizes are an exact multiple of a common dimension (fixed by agreement at 4). The
scheme, which is founded on the so-called ‘ modular ’ system, was originated in 1939 by the American
Standards Association under the sponsorship of the American Institute of Architects and the Producers
Council, a national organisation of manufacturers.”
668. WE RECOMMEND that modular standardisation of components be investigated by the
Experimental Building Station and the Standards Association of Australia for the following reasons to
secure :
(a) simplification of design ;
(b) cost reduction through limiting variety of sizes and, therefore, variety of plant ; and
(c) interchangeability of components irrespective of manufacturer.
669. Any objections which may be made to the standardisation of dwellings certainly do not
apply to the standardisation of domestic equipment. There is no logical reason why in all housing there
should be more than a small number of different types of stoves, refrigerators, sinks, baths, bath heaters,
and so on. WE RECOMMEND that, as a means of assisting standardisation of domestic equipment in
government-financed housing, the number of different styles thereof should be reduced to the number
necessary to allow adaptation to the needs of particular areas and particular types of dwellings. Large-
scale orders based on standard designs should reduce the cost, increase the speed of production, and in
general tend to increase the efficiency of the equipment supplied and facilitate servicing.
670. Furniture is normally regarded as needing to be far more individual than domestic equipment.
In practice, however, standardisation of furniture has existed for many years. The furniture sold by
most of the large shops shows very few variations in design. The superficial differences consist mainly
of differences in ornament, covering or colour. The individuality in the furnishing of any dwelling lies
in the adaptation of the furniture required to the particular living needs of the occupants, and in the
arrangement of that furniture so as to suit those needs.
671. In the post-war period, consideration should be given to encouraging the production of
a few standard lines of well-designed and constructed furniture. Colour and covering materials can
be varied as desired, but the purchaser would have a guarantee of sound construction throughout. The
object would be to replace the present standardisation of poor designs and, on the whole, poor construction
by standardisation of good designs and sound construction.
672. We consider that this should be supplemented also by building as much furniture as possible
into government-sponsored dwellings. This will have two obvious advantages in reducing the amount
which a young couple will need to spend in furnishing when they first marry, and by facilitating moving
in the case of persons transferred from one area to another. Admittedly, during the transition period,
until there are a large number of dwellings containing built-in furniture, there may be difficulties in the
case of families who cannot, in their new place of residence, obtain a dwelling where furniture is built-in,
and thus find themselves required to buy additional furniture. Difficulties of transition should not,
however, influence the general policy.
673. It is felt that in large housing schemes some guidance is necessary to assist the occupants
in furnishing their homes. The low grade furniture, poorly constructed with cheap varnish stain finishes,
attracts many, who fail to realise that it is a waste of money.
674. The furnishing of a home is such a personal matter that assistance can only be in the nature
of advice, and then only when advice is sought ; therefore, advancement in this aspect of housing is a
matter for education and for illustration by actual examples, so that the people who are to be the occupants
can be guided by the practical application of the principles of good design. The acceptance of such
principles will determine their value.
I. PREFABRICATION.
675. The part that prefabrication is to play in future housing is yet unknown, but it is evident
that some satisfactory results have been achieved in other countries. This Commission is conscious of
the advantages that prefabricated houses would have in assisting to solve the housing shortage, both in
urban and rural areas. It is, therefore, suggested that the problems relating to prefabrication should
be submitted to the Experimental Building Station for investigation and research. Typical problems
are :
(a) to investigate the possibilities of prefabrication, especially standardisation of components
of a house, on a panel I ised unit basis to enable sections of the entire house to be produced
in a factory, ready for speedy erection on the site ; and
( b ) research into methods of using prefabricated formwork to enable mass pouring of concrete
houses and, also, the prefabrication of concrete houses in panels or sections.


676. Prefabrication is developing rapidly in the United States of America, and there are indications
that there may be a similar development in England and Australia. Tins development is being sponsored
by private firms, as well as by government agencies. We consider that private firms should not be
discouraged from experimenting with the prefabrication of dwellings and/or components, but at the
same time the people should be protected against possible inferior construction. Therefore, WE
RECOMMEND that the Experimental Building Station should examine the standard of construction
of any prefabricated dwellings or components referred to it by the manufacturer and, if the standard
proves satisfactory, a certificate of approval be issued.
J. POSSIBLE RE-USE OF DEFENCE BUILDINGS.
677. We consider that every attempt should be made to re-use as far as possible building materials
which have been used for war purposes.
678. It should be possible to dismantle many buildings no longer required for defence purposes
and use the materials elsewhere. It may be possibleto use certain huts, after minor alterations are effected
to provide temporary accommodation while permanent dwellings are being erected ; some of the
larger camps are fairly close to city areas and reasonable transport to places of employment could be
provided.
K. LIFE OF DWELLING UNITS AND AMORTISATION PERIOD OF ADVANCES.
679. The principal factors which have a bearing on the effective life of buildings are construction,
design and location.
(a) Construction.
680. Well-built dwellings units will last for very many years if kept in constant repair. This
will apply to units built of any permanent materials.
681. An impression exists in Australia that timber-framed houses have a short life, but history
does not support this. There are many examples of timber-framed buildings in Europe many hundreds
of years old. In the United States of America many well-built, timber-framed and sheeted houses dating
from colonial times are still in use and are very attractive. On the other hand, many poorly-built timber
houses in Australia are only fit for demolition, though only erected for a comparatively short time.
This is due to the use of shoddy materials and to poor workmanship and, also, to the neglect of proper
upkeep.
( b) Design.
682. All h ouses should be designed with an intelligent understanding of climatic conditions
and appreciation of the materials used as well as the needs of the occupants. It follows that they must
all be designed by someone trained in his craft, if satisfactory results are to be produced.
683. The impression that the effective life of a timber dwelling is limited to approximately
twenty-five to thirty years has largely been formed because of bad construction and design. Obsolescence
of planning and design have been contributing factors. The early builders of houses in Australia knew
little of local conditions, largely copying houses in English towns.
684. Although narrow, ill-lit and badly-designed terrace houses were common, as many as
possible being squeezed on the land available, multi-storey dwellings were not built. On the whole,
domestic architecture was at a very low ebb, reflecting the depressing domestic design of the mid-
Victorian era in England ; such planning should not be repeated.
(c) Location.
685. The changing nature of developed areas renders housing obsolete in many cases. What
has been a good residential area in a good suburb deteriorates as the town spreads. Factories are
scattered about, large single family houses are occupied by several families often living in slum conditions,
buildings are not kept in repair, noise and smoke affect the people and a “ mixed area ” develops.
(d) Amortisation Period of Advances.
686. Government and semi-government organisations, banks, building societies and other agencies
advance money on new houses on terms which specify repayment periods varying from fourteen to
forty years, a common period being twenty-five years. In almost all cases a shorter period of repayment
is demanded when the house is of timber construction ; this is based on an assumption that the timber
house will not last as long as the brick one.
687. Although there are other factors affecting the most suitable time for repayment of loans
on houses, such as the working life of the home purchaser, the desirability of the purchaser acquiring an
equity in the property as soon as possible, etc., it is evident that the functional life of all dwellings well-
placed, well-built, well-designed, and well-cared-for, will very much exceed the usual periods for
repayment of loans.
(e) Declared “Life" for New Dwellings.
688. It has been suggested that on the erection of a building a fixed “ life ” should be declared
for that building and that it should be illegal to continue the use of that building after the termination
of the declared life, unless special permission has been obtained. This suggestion is sometimes accompanied
by the proposal that there should be a compulsory payment by the owner into a sinking fund so that the
replacement cost of the building would be accumulated at the termination of the declared life ; this


proposal has two main difficulties : Firstly, where the building had been financed originally by a loan,
double payments would have to be made by the owner, one as repayment of the loan and the other as
payment into a sinking fund to accumulate for later replacement of the building ; secondly, variations
in building cost would make it difficult to ensure that the amounts paid into the sinking fund were in
fact commensurate to replacement costs.
689. It is impossible to determine now what will be a satisfactory life for a new dwelling in the
light of changing building practices and ways of life. An appropriate rate of demolitions can be secured,
in the case of dwellings, by an adequate government housing programme so as to secure a sufficient supply
of dwellings provided it is supported by increased powers of present health and building inspectors to
condemn unsatisfactory dwellings. We are more concerned with improving the present quality of
housing than in anticipating conditions in another half century or more.
* (f) Recommendation.
690. WE RECOMMEND that for government-financed home-purchase schemes no difference
should be made in the period of purchase for any class of permanent construction. This recommendation
is based on the assumption that all government-sponsored dwelling units will be well-designed, well-
built, correctly located and well-cared for.
L. STANDARDS FOR NEW METHODS OF HOUSE CONSTRUCTION.
691. In assessing the merits of alternative forms of construction there are two considerations
to be taken into account :
(a) a proper standard of habitability ; and
( b) the extent to which alternative forms avoid calls on normal building labour.
692. To judge the technical efficiency of a system some standard of comparison is necessary.
Clearly brick construction does not constitute a reasonable comparison with alternative constructions,
because a brick house may have thicker and stronger walls than are necessary for structural stability
and to avoid moisture penetration. Therefore, new constructions can only be assessed in comparison
with an agreed set of standards of performance.
693. Accordingly WE RECOMMEND that technical criteria should be developed by the
Commonwealth Housing Authority in conjunction with the Experimental Building Station in the following
fields :
strength and stability;
moisture penetration and condensation;
thermal insulation;
sound insulation;
fire hazard;
maintenance and durability ; and
vermin infestation.
This list has already been adopted by the United Kingdom Inter-Departmental Committee appointed
by the Minister of Health, the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Works. (Post-War
Building Studies No. I, “ Home Construction,” London, 1944.)

A. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.
694. As we have stated earlier in this report, we regard housing as an expression of the way of
life of the people. It follows that housing must be adapted, not only to changing periods in the history
of the country, but also to the needs of particular sections of the people at any point of time. We have,
therefore, considered in this Part the housing needs of certain sections, which require special consideration
in order that their housing may be best adapted to their way of life. In the past, there has been a tendency
to think that it islmpossible to lay down a standard house which will be the ideal in any climate and for
any class of persons. We have already discussed the need for adaptation to meet particular housing
requirements.
B. MULTI-STOREY DWELLINGS.
695. In the whole housing field, there is probably no problem on which there is greater difference
of opinion than whether houses (single-unit dwellings) or flats (multi-storey dwellings) provide the most
desirable living conditions. The Commission considers arguments on the merits of one form or the
other are merely academic. We feel that both forms are necessary according to the particular way of
life and circumstances of the persons to be housed. The Department of Housing Construction in New
Zealand has recently adopted proposals for the erection of several blocks of multi-storey dwellings because
of the need for this type of dwelling.
696. The persons or families for whom multi-storey dwellings are particularly suited are as
follows :
(a) single persons, who wish to-have their own private accommodation as distinct from boarding
houses or hostels;
( b) married couples without children, or perhaps one child, who do not wish to garden and
require more time to pursue other interests;
(c) persons in either of the circumstances set out in (a) and (b), who are employed in occupations
which require periodic transfer, such as railway and postal workers, teachers and bank
clerks ; and
(d) middle-aged and elderly persons whose families have grown up and who do not desire to
continue with a house too large for them and with the responsibility of maintaining grounds.
697. The Commission considers that a single dwelling unit, surrounded with ample open space,
provides the most satisfactory living conditions for families with young children. In some °f thehigh
density inner areas, it will not be possible, because of the circumstances mentioned in paragraph 700 (b),
to build single dwellings for all families, though many will desire to be rehoused on the site therefore
the erection of a number of multi-storey dwellings for families will be unavoidable, but these must be
specially designed for this purpose.
698. We consider that this form of dwelling for families should not be more than three storeys
from ground level. Because of the lack of private open space where children may be left to play under
their parents’ care, supervised play areas should be provided ; the concentration of dwellings enables
this to be easily done.


699. For other persons the blocks should not be more than three storeys high if lifts are not
provided. Where lifts are provided we do not exclude the possibility that in some areas, particularly
in the inner areas of our towns, blocks of multi-storey dwellings six to twelve storeys high may be
appropriate, provided that the overall density does not exceed that laid down in paragraph 233, and
ample provision is made for recreation facilities.
700. The economic and technical advantages of multi-storey dwellings as against single dwelling
units are :
(o) land and its development costs less per dwelling unit ; because units are grouped vertically
they occupy less land than single dwelling units, even when adequate vacant land is left
free round the building. The cost of roads, transport, drainage, power and water is cheaper
per unit than in areas of single dwelling units;
(b) their use will enable the replacement of similar densities in high density areas. As
explained in Part V, in many inner areas of towns when slums are cleared it will be necessary
to rehouse the existing population on the same site, for the following reasons :
(1) generally those living in these sub-standard inner areas cannot afford high fares for
transport to outer areas;
(2) many of those living in these areas do not wish to move because of the convenience
of business and shopping facilities and because of the advantage gained from proximity
to employment, especially for those casually employed;
(3) if the inhabitants of clearance areas in inner city areas are housed in single dwelling
units in the outer suburbs the town would be spread, thereby adding to its inefficiency
and increasing the loss of time in travelling ; and
(4) only multi-storey dwellings can economically exploit high-cost land.
701. Design of Multi-Storey Dwellings. While we advocate the provision of multi-storey
dwellings under certain conditions, we at the same time insist that these dwellings should be of a reasonable
standard. The Commission has been impressed by the poor standard of these dwellings in many Australian
capitals. The objection which has been raised by many witnesses against this form of dwelling is well
founded and has influenced many people to believe that the single dwelling unit is the only satisfactory
solution.
702. We have, therefore, recommended standards, room sizes, site coverage and density for
government-sponsored housing in Appendix X, Division (ii), which will ensure that adequate space
is provided inside the dwelling for living, and also outside for play areas, gardens, etc. However, there
is generally room for much improvement in room arrangements, the planning of units within the building
and the placing of units on the site. Two of the main needs in multi-storey design are to eliminate noise
as much as possible and to provide privacy. These improvements cannot be effected by mandatory
standards, but are a matter for a greater awareness of modern requirements by both designers and the
public. Distribution of information by the Commonwealth Housing Authority on desirable planning
and layout arrangements should do much to encourage better design in this field.
C. ATTACHED DWELLING UNITS.
703. The Commission considers that in every housing development there should be a variety
of forms of dwellings to ensure that there is no appearance of monotonous standardisation. A certain
number of attached dwelling units included in any area of single dwelling units can add desirable variety
if designed as part of the whole scheme. Again, in replanning high density areas, we have advocated
that a mixture of multi-storey and attached and unattached single dwelling units should be the aim.
704. The illustration on page 96 indicates a typical area of housing in single dwelling units on
individual allotments. The gross density of this area is approximately 10.2 dwelling units per acre, which
could be regarded as a high density for this type of subdivision. The illustration on page 97 indicates
the same area replanned to accommodate the same number of persons, /.e., a gross density of 10.2 dwelling
units per acre in a mixture of single dwelling units, attached dwelling units and multi-storey dwellings.
The additional open space which can be obtained by this form of planning can be seen from the plan. Page
163 illustrates a detail planning of multi-storey dwellings, which is a section of the replanned area,
indicating the space between buildings. These illustrations have been adapted from drawings submitted
in evidence by the Modern Architectural Research Society, Perth.
705. A form of attached dwelling unit which will add further variety is the maisonette, a two-
storied structure, of which each householder occupies half the first and ground floors. The bedrooms
and bathroom are usually on the first floor, and the living area is on the ground floor. This arrangement
facilitates design to gain sunlight in all rooms as compared with the single storey attached dwelling unit ;
another benefit is that a large number of such dwellings on a new development would not only conserve
land but would reduce the cost of utilities.


This drawing indicates an existing subdivision in a suburb of a capital city.
Disadvantages : No separation of major road traffic from access and service road traffic, therefore
all widths and surfaces of roads need to be of the same standard. Allotments face on to maior roads with
consequent noise and traffic nuisance, and the standard of amenities is generally not high .
Single dwelling units on individual allotments provides for approximately 870 families.

of persons , i.e., gross density of 10.2 dwelling units per acre. This form of planning indicates the advantages
gained by open spaces, parks, playing areas, etc., which would be available for general use. This enables
a cross section of the community to be housed according to their individual desires, and also enables the
community facilities to be planned in proper relation to housing.

706. Attached dwelling units have the following advantages over single dwelling units :
(a) are more economical construction;
(b) reduce allotment size, still allowing the same amount of vacant land round each dwelling,
especially in the two-storied type;
(c) enable a higher density of population per acre but still keeping the density within desirable
limits ; and
(d) permit more pleasing design.
707. Terraced dwelling units have become a feature of English housing developments. Economy
of both construction and allotment size and reasonable density per acre are the main advantages. This
form of dwelling has never been popular in Australia mainly because of the precedent established in our
cities by the rows of badly designed tenements, which are now regarded by the layman as synonymous
with terraced houses.
708. English architects have shown that terraced dwellings can be designed to obtain good
ventilation and light and desirable living conditions.
709. The Commission feels that if some examples of terraced dwellings, well designed for the
cooler climates, were erected, much might be done to break down the strong prejudice against this type
of dwelling. Without public acceptance this form should not be used on a large scale.
D. RURAL WORKERS.
710. In Part XIV we discuss in detail the housing needs of the primary producer, the permanent
rural employee, the temporary rural employee, the seasonal and the casual rural worker. It is necessary
in this Part only to point to the fact that these groups have special housing requirements and to stress
that housing authorities should take special steps to provide for them, since this has not been done
adequately in the past.
E. HOSTELS.
(a) General.
711. Single persons have been very poorly catered for in the past, in many cases only those with
moderately large incomes being able to secure reasonable accommodation ; yet, there are very many
single persons who are obliged to live away from their parents, or who would be able to live a fuller life
if they could afford to live separately. The provision that is made for these persons in multi-storey
dwellings should be supplemented by hostel accommodation, and we set out briefly some kinds of hostels
which are urgently required.
(b) Hostels for Senior School Children.
712. At present many children living in country areas are either denied an adequate secondary
education or have to travel excessive distances to school. In some cases board is obtained with private
families convenient to the school ; in some cases hostel accommodation is provided by private bodies,
but generally, according to evidence, not sufficient. There is, accordingly, urgent need for government
action to fulfil this demand by organising the provision of adequately equipped and staffed hostels where
accommodation can be supplied at a reasonable cost to those who require to live away from home in
order to continue their education.
713. We consider that hostels for senior school children are required wherever high and technical
schools are built, and should be located near the schools ; we are of the opinion that the Education
Department of each State should collaborate with the State Housing Authority to devise ways and means
to meet this necessity.
(c) Hostels for Young People.
714. Hostels for young people are required in all large towns. Typical examples of those who
require this type of accommodation are students and young people who come from the country to work
in the large towns. The accommodation should be similar to that required for senior school children
except that less supervision is needed—therefore the number accommodated in one building can be
greater ; accommodation for a hundred has been considered an economic minimum to provide all the
amenities desirable.
(d) Hostels for People of Mature Age.
715. People of mature age who for economic or other reasons require hostel accommodation,
can be divided into three classes :
(1) single persons liable to transfer from locality to locality;
(2) single persons with moderate or small incomes who require permanent homes ; and
(3) industrial workers employed at some distance from their homes.
(I) Single Persons Liable to Transfer from Locality to Locality.
716. In this group are school teachers, policemen, railway and postal employees, bank clerks
and others. The Commission received evidence in all parts of Australia which clearly showed the
difficulties experienced by these people to secure adequate accommodation and the urgent need for
hostels.


(2) Single Persons with Moderate or Small Incomes who require Permanent Homes.
717. Many of these people live in cities and at present are very ill-housed in single rooms or sub-
standard houses. The Commission has been impressed with the unfortunate plight of many folk in the
large cities who are forced to live in depressing or sub-standard housing conditions.
718. Large buildings should be built of modern design with most rooms large enough to be
furnished as bed-sitting rooms with a proportion of bedrooms and sitting rooms grouped. Sun balconies
should be provided where possible.
719. Buildings of this type are needed in our large cities, especially near railway terminals, wharfs
and in other densely populated areas. Adequate open space for lawns, trees and gardens should be
provided.
(3) Workers Employed at Some Distance from Their Homes.
720. It is necessary to make provision for the suitable housing of workers employed away from
their homes, particularly in industrial towns where employment shifts from time to time. Evidence
was submitted to the Commission that in many areas this group has not been satisfactorily catered for.
The Commission, however, visited areas where satisfactory accommodation has been provided, such as
the men’s hostels atWhyalla (South Australia), Northam (Western Australia), and Glen Davis (New
South Wales).
721. Each man or woman requires a comfortable room, large enough to be furnished as a bed-
sitting room. The other features should be similar to those of other hostels, but strict economy is
necessary since many of the men may be married and only temporarily away from their families,
consequently the charges must be kept down to a minimum.
722. A social hall adjoining the dining room is a good arrangement. Garden space, trees and
shrubs should surround the building.
(e) Finance and Management.
723. In all replanning and new planning schemes the State Housing Authority should provide for
the erection and equipment of hostels for the sections of the people outlined above. The capital cost
of land and buildings should be provided by the Commonwealth and State Governments under the same
conditions and arrangements as for individual houses.
724. There should be flexibility in arrangements for the management of hostels ; they may be
managed by direct control by the State Housing Authority, be furnished and equipped and then leased
to a local government authority or to an approved private organisation or persons.
(f) Recommendation.
725. WE RECOMMEND that with respect to hostels :
(1) in planning housing estates in towns, sites should be provided for hostels for the following
persons :
(i) senior school children;
(ii) young people, including students;
(iii) people of mature age, including single persons liable to transfer, and workers employed
at some distance from their homes;
(2) the erection of these hostels should proceed where the need for them has been established
and the availability of resources permits;
(3) the hostels should be erected, furnished and equipped by the State Housing Authority ;
and
(4) the State Housing Authority should have power to manage these hostels or lease them to
a local government authority or other approved body or person.
F. AGED AND INFIRM PERSONS.
726. This group refers principally to old age and invalid pensioners. The community has not
made adequate provision for this section of the people. After many years, it has become recognised that
the community, as a whole, owes a means of living to these persons. Beyond this, however, there has
been little official recognition of responsibility. Provision of any special accommodation or recreational
facilities has been largely the work of private organisations, and they have been only able to touch the
fringe of the problem. We consider that the government-financed housing programme should make
special provision for this group, both as regards suitable accommodation and as regards provision of
reasonable community facilities.
727. Two types of accommodation need to be provided ; many retired persons are physically
robust and wish to live separately in the community ; there should be no suggestion of setting them
apart in a special area ; some would enjoy the companionship of group accommodation, and others need
special assistance to be readily available.
728. The first of these types is best provided for by attached dwellings scattered throughout
the community. A suitable design for a dwelling to serve this purpose is given as Type Ain Appendix
XIX. These dwellings should be designed so as to minimise housework and might be either single units
or attached.


729. Administration, supervision and care for the partly incapable can be more economically
provided in group schemes. Provision of adequate facilities for recreation also may be easier. Group
housing of this type might be either in the form of separate cottages or in the form of small attached
units ; both should have common rooms and central staff for domestic service or nursing assistance.
730. The provision of adequate recreational facilities for the older age group in the community
should receive the detailed consideration of the Community Facilities Committees recommended in
paragraphs 841 and 842. We would oppose any suggestion that the recreation of this group should be
rigidly separated from that of the rest of the community, but some additional facilities should be provided
in a restful atmosphere. We would suggest that a minimum provision might be a clubroom, a carpenter’s
shop well equipped with tools and materials for making such things as toys, a sewing room, and an area
for outdoor recreation. Those who wished to continue using general recreational facilities would, of
course, be perfectly free to do so. Much of this work will be experimental and the State Community
Facilities Committee should arrange for ful| discussions with the pensioners’ associations and other
organisations interested.
731. WE RECOMMEND that with respect to aged and infirm persons :
(a) special provision should be made by the State Housing Authority in the government-
financed housing programme for such persons, this should take the following form :
(1) for those who desire to live in separate units, special accommodation in the form of
dwellings scattered through the community in ground floor flats, or attached dwelling
units, and letting them, if necessary, with a rental rebate;
(2) for those who prefer to live in groups, by accommodation (suitably furnished where
necessary) grouped either as separate dwellings with central common rooms or as
small dwelling units with central common rooms and central service ; the Authority
manage same or arrange to lease such groups of buildings to a government department,
local government authority or other approved organisation ; and
( b ) consideration should be given by the Commonwealth and State Community Facilitie
Committees to the provision of suitable recreational facilities for such persons.
G. ABORIGINES.
732. Housing for aborigines presents special problems, partly because of the differing extent
of their contact with white communities, partly because of the extent of the prejudice which exists
against housing aborigines in the same settlement as white people or at the same standard, and partly
because many of them travel frequently from place to place.
733. The evidence of the Western Australian Commissioner of Native Affairs is pertinent in
this regard, and the following is an extract therefrom : “ The social outlook of the natives is changing.
Especially is this so with detribalised natives and half-castes. The extension of social benefits to de-
tribalised natives has given them a new interest in life, and many of them are striving to improve their
living conditions and social circumstances.”
734. Where an aborigine desires to have good housing he is frequently frustrated by his low
level of income. Quoting again from the evidence of the Western Australian Commissioner of Native
Affairs : “ Statistics are not available regarding the wage groups of natives. Lads and domestics earn
from 15/- a week and keep to £2 a week and keep, and adult males receive from 25/- per week and keep
up to basic and arbitration rates, as, for instance, native shearers who receive the prescribed rates.”
735. We are of the opinion that aborigines should be provided with reasonable accommodation
in relation to their welfare, but in view of the difficulties to achieve this, which difficulties necessitate
a very close study by persons experienced in the welfare of aborigines, we are not making any specific
recommendations. We consider, however, that this should be recognised as one of the problems of
government-financed housing and that States with an appreciable aboriginal population should see that
their Housing Authority gives early consideration to the question. WE RECOMMEND that where
aborigines can take their place in the community and desire to be housed in towns, the standard of housing
should be comparable to that already laid down as a reasonable standard. As the wages paid to aborigines
are generally low, this may mean a government subsidy. Where aborigines are employed on stations,
we consider that accommodation should be as provided for seasonal workers generally (see paragraphs
762-765).
H. OTHER GROUPS.
736. There are many other sections of the community which present special housing problems.
We do not propose to deal with them in detail, but merely to quote a few additional instances so as to
illustrate the necessity for all planning to be adapted to local conditions and, in particular, to the means
of livelihood of the people to be housed.
737. In planning accommodation for shift workers, special attention should be given to provision
of some measure of sound-proofing and planning to ensure that one bedroom is as far as possible away
from noise and that it will be cool during the day.


738. Transport workers often need to live close to their work as the/ may have to go to and from
work at hours when transport is difficult. Multi-storey dwellings close to centres of towns will provide
for some of those who wish to avoid long travelling at inconvenient times.
739. Some persons, such as permanent railway workers, required to be housed at long distances
from settlement. Particular attention should be given in these cases to ensuring that the standard of
housing is good and that provision is made for as many amenities and recreational facilities as possible.
Too little consideration has been given to these factors in the past.
740. There are certain mining towns in Australia where the housing is most unsatisfactory, due,
principally, it was stated, to the reluctance of financial institutions to invest in home building, as there
was some uncertainty as to the continuance of the industry ; some of these towns are generations old and,
in consequence, families have been reared in sub-standard housing—this is, to say the least, not fair to
wives and children. We consider that where a reasonable life of the industry can be established, this bad
state of affairs should not be allowed to continue, and action should be taken to make finance for home-
building available possibly on a shorter term than usual, according to the estimated life of the industry.
The development of a demountable house of the standards recommended by us should assist substantially
to overcome objections, and thus enable families to live in surroundings comparable with those living
in towns where industry is more stable.

A. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.
741. We consider that, as far as possible, the housing standards in rural areas should be comparable
to those in urban areas. There are practical difficulties in some country districts, such as absence of an
electricity supply and a good water supply ; there are also difficulties in organising community facilities
in areas of scattered population. We wish, however, to make it clear, at the outset, that we consider
there should be no distinction between the country and town dweller in regard to standards of housing.
Special consideration must be given, however, to certain specific problems of rural housing.
742. The standard of housing in rural townships is generally low. This is due partly to the
retention of housing erected in pioneering days, partly to high transport costs, and partly to lack of
skilled building labour. The average standard of housing on rural properties is low and in some cases
the standard is very low. It can be argued that, in rural areas, people require a higher not a lower standard
of housing to compensate for the lack of amenities which are available to most town dwellers. Bad
housing conditions have, in the past, encouraged the population movement from the country to the city.
Unless standards are improved, post-war new rural settlement will be retarded, and those who have
moved to the city during wartime may not be prepared to return to country life.
743. Some of the factors contributing towards poor housing conditions in small towns and in
rural areas in the past are :
(a) distance from the centres where building materials are manufactured and where building
labour is available—this involves heavy transport costs;
( b ) the fluctuating income of primary producers, which makes it difficult for them to undertake
regular annual commitments for housing in addition to other commitments in respect of the
property;
(c) it is usual for the primary producer to give precedence to expenditure on the development
and equipment of his property rather than on improving his dwelling;
(d) difficulty in securing financial assistance ; and
(e) inadequacy of health, educational and recreational facilities in many country districts.
744. The following discussion is confined to housing standards and special housing problems of
rural dwellers. The economic aspects of rural housing have not received detailed consideration because
they were regarded as part of the economy of the farm generally, and are being considered by the Rural
Reconstruction Commission.
745. We consider that general supervision of the legislation prescribing standards of habitation
in rural areas should come within the powers of the State Housing Authority, but we stress that these
powers should first be the the local government authority (see paragraphs 623-631).
B. SPECIAL PROBLEMS.
(a) Primary Producer with a Well-established Property and Low Standard House.
746. It has been stated to this Commission that there is no need to lay down a standard for
housing on rural properties, since there is little danger of the health of those living on these properties
being affected by a low standard house, and even if it were there would be little danger of the health of
these people affecting others, as is the case with city dwellers ; with this we do not agree. A low


standard of housing such as draughty houses with earth floors, unscreened doors and windows, absence
of proper food storage, bad lighting and ventilation, begets bad health and often disease. The ill-health
of any member of the community must have some effect on the health of others through passing contacts
and intermarriage. In addition, we consider it unreasonable that a primary producer who can afford
a decent dwelling should be allowed to provide his wife and children with living conditibns inferior to
those which would be permitted in a town.
747. We have already recommended (see paragraph 630) that the States should be asked to pass
legislation making obligatory the standards of habitation set out in Appendix X, Division (i). These
standards should apply to all rural dwellings as well as to town dwellings.
748. It will be impossible for all rural dwellings to be brought up to the standards of habitation
within a short period after the war, since a large portion of available building resources will be needed
for the erection of new dwellings. Extensions of time for repairs and alterations must only be allowed
in special cases , the aim should be to ensure that all rural dwellings are brought up to the prescribed
standards within five years.
749. Should an owner be unable from his own resources to have his house brought to the required
standard, loans should be made available on reasonable terms and conditions through a government
agency with branches and representatives throughout the State concerned ; no such loans should be
made unless the owner satisfies the agency that he cannot finance the work without suffering undue
hardship. The most suitable body to make these loans may be different in each State and, therefore,
no definite recommendation in this regard can be made. As far as possible, it would be preferable for
these loans to be made through an agency which is already concerned with rural finance.
750. It has been suggested that loans made to bring housing up to the prescribed standards of
habitation should take priority over existing debts. There may be objection to this on the ground that
a good house does not raise the productive capacity of the farm, as compared with other improvements
and equipment ; a provision for priority over existing loans has previously been associated only with
measures that would increase the farm income ; we hold, however, that a farm is not an economic one
unless it is capable of maintaining a house of the approved standard. Therefore, we would suggest that
if the existing mortgagee is unwilling to lend for housing improvements, the government should do so
and such loan become a first charge on the property ; in some cases, however, it may be desirable for
the government financing agency to take over the debt on the property, after adjustment if necessary,
and then make the required loan for housing.
(b) Primary Producer on an Uneconomic Farm with a Low Standard of House.
751. Measures to re-establish the primary producer on an uneconomic farm are matters for
consideration by the Rural Reconstruction Commission. We feel, however, that we cannot refrain from
commenting on cases where the farm is unable to support the additional debt involved in bringing the
dwelling up to the standards recommended by us. We consider that any farm which cannot support a
dwelling of this standard should be subject to adjustment, so as to increase the net income of the farmer.
This adjustment may be effected by an increase in the size of the farm or in some cases by debt adjustment.
If the method of debt adjustment is used, the cost of a good standard house should first be included in the
capital liability.
(c) New Settlers.
752. When new areas are being settled and sizes of living areas are being determined, due
consideration should be given that the area is sufficient to permit the settler to make an income that will
enable him to have a dwelling of the approved standard.
753. We consider that housing ir. new areas should provide for the immediate needs of the settler.
Designs for dwellings which would permit additions when required to accommodate a family are included
in Appendix XIX. Other designs can be evolved for use in a similar way.
(d) Permanent Farm Workers.
754. There are two main ways of providing adequate housing for permanent farm workers :
(1) provision of group housing in closely settled areas ; and
(2) improvement in the standard of housing provided for employees on rural properties.
(I) Group Housing in Closely Settled Areas.
755. We consider that where the density of population permits there are many advantages in
farm workers living away from the property on which they work. There is more variety in living when
leisure time is spent apart from the place of employment. There is more security when housing is not
linked entirely with employment, and there is more possibility of amenities and greater opportunities
for social life where a number of workers are housed in groups.
756. Wherever possible, housing for permanent farm workers should be provided in rural
townships as a part of other government-financed housing. A full community life may be developed
in these townships and adequate supervision of the housing may be provided through a local government
authority or other agency for the State Housing Authority.


757. In cases where a township is likely to develop it may be possible to erect small groups of
dwellings for farm workers. It is inadvisable that a worker should be required, under normal conditions,
to travel for more than half-an-hour to his place of employment. A full report on the probable future
of the district should be obtained by the State Housing Authority before it embarks on housing of this
type, since a change in land use might mean a shift in the demand for labour and therefore a reduction
in the need for housing in that area. Attention should be given also to ensuring that there will be adequate
supervision of the maintenance of the dwellings, particularly if any should become unoccupied. Group
housing is most suitable in irrigation and horticultural areas and in some dairying, sugar-cane growing
and other closely settled districts.
(2) Housing on Rural Properties.
758. In many cases the scattered nature of the population and the irregular hours necessary for
farm workers make it most desirable for them to live on the property on which they are working. It
is necessary to ensure that adequate housing is supplied for such employees and their families.
759. We are of the opinion that rural wages should be sufficient to ensure that a farm worker is
able to pay rent for a good standard house on the same basis as the urban worker, that is, the maximum
amount payable for rent should not exceed the economic rent or one-sixth of the family income. At
the same time we consider that legislation should provide that suitable standards of accommodation
comparable to urban standards must be maintained where accommodation is to be supplied by the
employer.
760. Because of the probable post-war shortage of building resources it will be necessary to allow
extensions of time up to, say, five years, within which existing housing for employees must be brought
up to the approved standards of habitation. Where the employee is married suitable accommodation
for the family should be provided in accordance with the standards laid down in Appendix X, Division (ii).
761. Loans on easy terms should be made available through a government agency to enable the
property owner to meet the requirements of the proposed legislation on standards of accommodation
for rural employees. If the productive capacity of a property is not sufficient to stand the additional
capital debt made necessary, the property should be regarded as an uneconomic unit and be subject to
adjustment in the same way as the properties discussed in paragraph 751. If loans for housing of employees
are made difficult because of the attitude of an existing mortgagee we consider that action should be
taken as suggested in paragraph 750.
(e) Seasonal Workers.
762. In Australia there are many kinds of rural work which involve residence for only a short
period in a district. Typical examples are shearing, sugar-cane cutting, fruit, vegetable and hop harvesting.
Unsatisfactory provision has been made for housing persons employed on this type of work.
763. Legislative provision for housing for certain classes of seasonal workers has already been
made in some States, but in other States practically no provision has bee/i made. Many seasonal workers
still live in insanitary shacks and tents. We consider that a minimum standard of accommodation should
be laid down by legislation in all cases where it is necessary for seasonal workers to be housed on private
property. Clearly it would not be possible to maintain the same standard as is required for permanent
farm workers, and suitable provision for families could not be expected. It is, however, reasonable to
expect a good standard of shelter to be provided with sanitary conveniences and provision for cooking
and heating.
764. In some cases it may be possible for group accommodation to be provided in closely settled
areas, such as fruit-growing areas, where the workers may go from property to property. The main
difficulty in accommodation of this type is that adequate supervision must be maintained, both while
it is being used by the seasonal workers and at other periods of the year. We suggest that while
accommodation of this type may be erected through the State Housing Authority, the cost and maintenance
should be the responsibility of the local government authority, who could be recouped, wholly or partly,
for such expenditure by rents received while the accommodation is occupied and from payments by the
producers benefited. It may be necessary for the Commonwealth or State to grant a subsidy in special
circumstances. In periods when the accommodation is not required by seasonal workers, it may be
possible for it to be used as holiday camps, run by such bodies as the National Fitness Council, Scouts
and Guides, or as accommodation for motorists.
765. It is suggested that some of the accommodation may be demountable and some of the facilities,
such as kitchens and showers, may be mobile. It is possible that Army and Civil Construction Corps
camp buildings and equipment may be suitable for this purpose.
(f) Casual Farm Labourers.
766. In some areas there is a number of farm labourers who are not employed for any length of
time on a particular farm, but who move from property to property within the one district. In general,
these persons are best catered for by the general government housing scheme providing housing in
rural townships. Consideration should be given to any request to house workers of this kind on small
farms which, while not economic units, are sufficient to provide a small income and to be worked by the
occupant during periods between employment. Care would need to be taken that areas of this type
did not come to be regarded as ordinary farms and subject to provisions for adjustment into full living
areas.


(g) Temporary Employees.
767. There are throughout Australia a number of men who are not employed for very long in
any given area. This applies to men engaged on public works such as water conservation, electrification,
road making, and to such persons as timber-cutters, who work out one area and then move on. We
consider that a minimum standard of accommodation should be provided for these men in the same way
as for any other citizen of Australia. The standard would naturally be different from that provided for
permanent workers ; a permanent structure, however, is impracticable and, accordingly, in many cases
the accommodation should be demountable. In some cases of very short residence, tents might be used
for sleeping with mobile units to supply cooking, first aid, dining and recreation needs.
768. Considerable experience has been gained during the war years in constructing temporary
camps for Civil Construction Corps workers. We consider that this experience should be used as a
basis for investigating a suitable standard of construction to be used for persons temporarily employed
in rural areas. We stress the urgency of this investigation to provide accommodation for workers
employed on national works in the early post-war years.
C. RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING RURAL HOUSING.
(a) Standards.
769. WE RECOMMEND that for new permanent dwellings the standards laid down for
government-sponsored urban housing in Appendix X, Division (ii), should apply also to government-
sponsored rural housing, with certain qualifications, such as :
(1) the provision of piped water, electricity and/or gas will depend on the existence of a public
supply in the area in question ; and
(2) the allowable percentage for additional floor area will be 4 per cent, greater than for urban
dwellings. This will allow for additional verandahs, larger living space and store rooms.
770. WE RECOMMEND also that State Governments should be asked to enact legislation
requiring existing rural dwellings to be brought up to the standard of habitation laid down in Appendix X,
Division (i), within a prescribed period, say, twelve months ; extension of time up to five years may be
granted upon application for carrying out this provision. If any dwelling is incapable of being brought
up to this standard it must be demolished. A government agency, which also makes loans on rural
property, should be empowered to make loans on reasonable terms and conditions for the purpose of
bringing dwellings up to this standard.
771. WE RECOMMEND that State Governments should be asked to enact legislation to require
suitable accommodation to be provided for all single farm workers where housed on rural properties,
and to require existing housing provided for married farm workers to be of at least the standard of
habitation laid down in Appendix X, Division (i). The legislation may provide for a lower standard of
accommodation being permitted for seasonal workers of stated types, but precautions should be taken
against permanent workers being housed according to the standard permitted for seasonal workers.
772. WE RECOMMEND that the Commonwealth Housing Authority should initiate investigations
into suitable minimum standards of accommodation for seasonal workers and all temporary rural employees.
773. We recognise that it will be difficult to implement the provisions regarding the standard
of existing dwellings within a short time partly because of the need to allow for the fluctuating income
of the primary producer and partly because of the probable shortage of building resources in the immediate
post-war period.
774. Throughout all consideration of rural housing, emphasis should be placed on the need to
investigate fully the type of housing most suited to the particular climatic each area.
(b) Relation between State Housing 11 Authority and Financing'Authorities.
775. The functions of the State Housing Authority in rural housing have been indicated above*
Where housing is provided in townships or small groups it will be the direct responsibility of the State
Housing Authority or any local government authority to which this responsibility may have been delegated.
WE RECOMMEND that in the case of housing on rural properties finance should be made available on
reasonable terms and conditions through a government agency which has also power to lend onthe
whole property. This agency would then be responsible for all day to day administration, but would be
subject to the State Housing Authority as regard standards and to the State Planning Authority in regard
to the size of its housing programme and its allocation.
(c) Building Technique in Country Areas.
776. The cost of building houses on scattered sites in rural areas is high. The economies of
large-scale building are not possible, transport for labour and materials is cost y and living costs for labour
may be high. These factors together with the need for complete removability of houses under certain
circumstances point to this field in which prefabrication can major part.
777 We advocate the development of a demountable house, sections of which could be built in
a variety of designs by production line methods in centres where a number of houses are reqmred and
these sections transported withjbuilt-in equipment complete tofthefsite ; they could thus be readily
removed if longerfrequired.


778. In areas where farm houses are more remote panel prefabrication could be used and much
of the labour in assembling the parts could be provided by the farmer.
779. WE RECOMMEND that the Experimental Building Station should investigate the possibilities
of demountable and prefabricated houses and other methods of reducing the cost of housing in rural
areas.
(d) Rural Amenities.
780. The disabilities of rural life are not only those associated with the low average standard of
housing but very often the lack of reasonable provision of health services and recreation facilities. We
understand that the Rural Reconstruction Commission is making detailed recommendations on this
subject, but we find it impossible for us to discuss rural housing without pointing to the urgent need
for mobile health services, mobile libraries, provision for better education (including hostels in townships
for school children) and provision for some cultural life in rural townships by such means as travelling
art exhibitions, lectures, plays and concerts.
731. The question of extending public utilities in rural areas is beyond the field of inquiry of this
Commission. We consider it necessary to point out, however, that the standard of living in rural areas
would be greatly raised by an extension of electricity and piped water supply and by a wider provision of
telephone services.
782. Community facilities in country towns are considered in Part XVI.
(e) Publicity.
783. We recognise that in a number of cases residents in rural areas may prefer other expenditure
to an improved standard of housing. We consider that widespread publicity is necessary to inform the
people of the advantages of an improved standard of housing and to make it clear to them how this may
be obtained. This publicity should take the form not only of leaflets, lectures, and news-reels for adults,
but should be carried into primary, secondary and technical schools. The organisation of publicity should
be the joint responsibility of the State Housing Authority and a government agency which has normally
many contacts in rural areas, e.g., Department of Agriculture, Rural Bank. The Commonwealth Housing
Authority could assist in the preparation of the material (see paragraph 421).

A. FOREWORD.
784. The bad conditions which now exist in sub-standard areas in many Australian towns have
been referred to in Part 111. Because of the national loss in' human life and happiness, we consider that
slum clearance must be regarded as a national problem.
785. Provision of new housing by a housing authority aims at reducing the housing shortage and
at the demolition of sub-standard dwellings. It opens up, on the one hand, all the practical questions
of economic and business organisation which are dealt with in this Part and, on the other hand, psychological
and social problems, which are discussed in paragraphs 440-479.
B. PLANNING OF SLUM CLEARANCE.
786. The clearance of slum areas presents two major alternatives in planning policy, as follows :
(a) “ Mass clearance ” by which areas of sub-standard property may be declared as “clearance
areas,” all the buildings in the area being demolished and the site re-developed ; or
(b) “ Equivalent elimination ” under which the housing authority is required to demolish
an equivalent number of sub-standard dwellings for all new dwellings erected.
787. The advantages and disadvantages of both methods are set out below. Our considered
opinion is that both methods will be needed to effect slum clearance.
(a) Moss Clearance.
788. The main advantages of mass clearance are :
(1) bold attack on problem —the eradication of slums is visible and dramatic if tackled in this
manner;
(2) whole communities could be moved to new housing without breaking community
associations and friendships;
(3) bad slum pockets can be quickly eliminated and re-development started immediately,
(4) many houses which are undesirable but could not be condemned as unhealthy would be
removed ; and
(5) large areas of towns can be replanned concurrently to fit in with the plan for the town;
789. The main disadvantages of mass clearance are :
(1) payment of compensation for properties in the declared areas still fit for habitation and,
in unzoned local government areas, for land regarded as suitable for other uses than housing ;
and
(2) hardship to a number of families living in houses which are not sub-standard within the
declared area, and waste of potential resources in their re-housing during a time of acute
shortage.
(b) Equivalent Elimination.
790. The main advantages of equivalent elimination are :
(1) more gradual attack on the problem which would allow more thorough preparations;
(2) buildings which are up to standard are not acquired ; therefore this method is less costly,
as the area is cleared only as dwellings are demolished ; and
(3) all available building resources would be used for relieving the worst conditions, instead
of for re-housing many whose homes are in reasonable condition.


791. The main disadvantages of equivalent elimination are :
(1) unless strictly controlled, it could develop into a piecemeal attack on the problem;
(2) with this less visible and slower process the public would undoubtedly fail to appreciate
that anything was being done to clear the slums,
m eliminating one dwelling unit or small groups of dwelling units at a time and moving the
people out of areas would mean that families break their old associations this has been
shown in other countries to be a major problem ; and
in order to ensure that dwellings are not re-erected on land thus cleared, thereby restricting
the re-planning of the area, the authority would have to buy the land ; this may be an
uneconomic proposition, if the land has to be held for many years, before the area is cleared
sufficiently to replan.
792 This Commission feels that both policies of mass clearance and equivalent elimination should
be adopted according to the particular circumstances of each case, for example, where slum-clearance
is undertaken in a suburb of high density in which there is open space the practice might be to build
housin e on the existing open space, to transfer the occupants of houses from a clearance area, which
could t ? hen become the ? open space for the area. If open spaces in high density areas are built upon, speed
in re-creating new open spaces is essential. This would not be the case with the policy of equivalent
eliminator, This lauer policy would be best applied in the outer suburbs where there is plenty of low-
cosT land and open spaces ; the more gradual policy would not affect the living conditions in the area to
such an WE RECOMMEND that the policy on clearance of slums is a matter for decision in
each particular'case between the State Planning Authority, the State Housing Authority and the local
government authority. We would, however, emphasise that in every case the clearance and re-
development should be carried out according to a predetermined plan conforming to the plan of the
whole town.
C. DENSITY.
793. Consideration has been given to the desirable density of housing in urban areas. This is
discussed in paragraphs 207-239.
D. SIZE AND PERIOD OF SLUM CLEARANCE] PROGRAMME.
794 It is clear that the housing shortage will be so acute for some years after the war
that demolition and replacement of sub-standard houses, apart from those which ar ®, e^ an S e^ n
health of the occupants, will not be possible. However, it is desirable that these houses should be replaced
as early as practicable. The Commission considers that a proportion of the new dwelling units erected
in the early post-war years should be apportioned to replace homes demolished. We consider slum
clearance a major part of the housing programme, and planning for it should have the earliest attention
possible in view of the large amount of preparatory work to be done.
E. COST OF ACQUISITION AND COMPENSATION.
795. There has been little actual experience in Australia of the acquisition of slum property and
land for re-development. However, from our investigations it is clear that the two major problems of
cost are . compensatjon has t 0 be pai d f or that property in a “ clearance area ” which has not been
declared unfit for human habitation;
From our observations there are very few “ clearance areas ’ of a
size sufficient to replan comprehensively which do not contain a number of
houses of reasonable standard.
(2) property values in high density areas are high. Some of the factors affecting values are as
follows :
(i) the density of the population;
The rentals may not be relatively high in some areas, but the
total rentals returned from slum property are high because of the ove
crowded conditions and this is reflected in the valuation of land.
(ii) where areas are not zoned industries are frequently built in residential districts,
This causes all land in the area to be regarded as suitable for
industrial purposes and this is reflected in the increased valuation.
(jjj) slum property, in many cases, pays good returns because the owners usually regard
it as unworthy of maintenance.
(a) Compensation for Property in Clearance Areas.
796. Under the law, the owner of property which is declared unfit for human habitation is
compelled either to repair the property to bring it up to standard or to vacate for demolition. The
existing Victorian and South Australian housing legislation makes it clear that no compensation need be
paid for the structure so declared. In the other States this is not made clear. These provisions in South
Australia and Victoria will facilitate slum clearance in those States. WE RECOMMEND that legislation
be enacted in all States that no compensation be paid for houses declared unfit for habitation but ex gratia
payments may be made in certain circumstances as set out in the Model Housing Act, Part VIII
(Appendix VI).


797. It is recognised that compensation must be paid for property which is not declared unfit
for human habitation. The methods of assessing compensation for property resumed are set out in
various Commonwealth and State Acts. Recognised methods of valuation for freehold property, however,
are the unimproved value, the improved value, and the assessed annual value :
(I) the unimproved value is the amount which the fee simple of the land might be expected to
realise if offered for sale at the date of valuation on reasonable terms and conditions,
assuming that the improvements, if any, had not been made;
(2) the improved value is based on what the land and the buildings might be expected to realise
if offered for sale under reasonable terms and conditions ; and
(3) the assessed annual value is computed on a proportion of the fair rental value, certain
deductions being allowed.
Note. —The realised price would be the point of agreement between
a willing but not over-anxious purchaser and a not unwilling seller.
798. As will be seen, the improved value, based on market value, is affected by the demand for
the type of property. In time of great shortage the value of dwellings would rise in spite of the general
depreciation of the property. The market value of the property is, therefore, not related to the true
obsolescence of the improvements. The result is clearly seen in the decayed areas of our towns where
old dilapidated dwellings bring high prices on the market because they return high rentals. The
depreciation is not recognised proportionately to the actual deterioration of materials or obsolescence
of planning and equipment. These high market values are a great barrier to the effective clearance of
insanitary slum areas.
799. We have given consideration to methods of reducing the high cost of compensation resulting
from the high market values.
800. Four possible means have been suggested to the Commission and are discussed below :
(1) changing the basis of valuation for compensation;
(2) licensing of the life of buildings;
(3) eliminating consideration of unreasonably high rents ; and
(4) zoning of areas.
(1) Changing the Basis of Valuation for Compensation.
801. It has been frequently said that compensation for the resumption of property should be
assessed on some basis other than the market value. We include below a discussion of two methods
which have been suggested :
(i) Cost of the Building less Depreciation.
802. Under this method the original cost of erecting the building would be reduced to allow
for an agreed rate of depreciation, and this amount only would be payable as compensation. There are
some difficulties associated with the calculation of depreciation, but these are not insuperable.
803. This method may be regarded as equitable where the original owner retains possession of
the property. If the ownership of the property has been transferred, however, the present owner may
justly claim that the basis of compensation should be the cost of the property to him, and not its original
cost. If this were agreed, the market value would again become the basis of compensation.
(ii) Replacement Cost less Depreciation.
804. By this method compensation would be assessed on the replacement cost of the building
less depreciation at an agreed rate. This would be likely to bring compensation nearer to the market
value than the previous method. If, however, a high allowance were made for depreciation, it would
prevent inflated compensation being claimed for obsolete property.
805. Both these methods suffer from a major disadvantage in that they regard compensation
for the dwelling as distinct from compensation for the site. In the resumption of sub-standard property,
the value of the site is likely to be of more importance than the value of the building on the site. We
are of the opinion that the question of compensation cannot be considered adequately apart from the
question of land values. WE RECOMMEND that the special committee referred to in paragraphs 310
and 314, also report on compensation for the resumption of built-up areas for purposes of replanning,
with particular regard to securing a uniform basis of compensation which will disallow inflated values due
to the housing shortage or to unearned increment which has accrued to owners of the property.
(2) Licensing of the Life of Buildings.
806. This provision envisages that the local government authority would inspect all buildings in
development areas, and would issue a license allowing the building to remain for a stated period determined
by the probable effective physical, economic and income-producing life of the building. The method
of assessing the life of buildings could be laid down as a result of a conference between the Commonwealth
and State Planning Authorities.
807. The advantages of this system are :
(i) compensation for resumption could be more easily determined;
(ii) the planning and housing authorities would be enabled to formulate a definite programme
for the re-building and re-development of any area;


(iii) the cost of re-planning schemes would be reduced because owners of old and derelict
properties would not be able to claim inflated prices on account of the use to which the
buildings were being put and the rentals derived from them;
(iv) it would encourage progressive developments in methods of house construction ; and
(v) it would prove a basis for the long-term planning of the building and allied industries with
consequent stead/ and regular employment.
808. The disadvantages of the system are :
(i) local government authorities may be reluctant to apply the law in the case of owner-
occupied houses ; and
(ii) the owner would be loath to undertake repairs during the later years of the period of
license.
809. After having carefully considered the advantages and disadvantages, whilst we do not
specifically recommend the system, we consider that this method could be usefully employed in certain
areas and being a planning matter should be further considered by the Commonwealth and State Planning
Authorities.
(3) Eliminating Consideration of Unreasonably High Rents.
810. At present, in some States, the income produced by a property is a major factor in assessing
compensation for that property if it is resumed. Thus compensation may be unduly high because of
excessive rents charged for the property. We consider that the fair rent only should be taken into
consideration in assessing compensation, and that where a dwelling is condemned as unfit for human
habitation the cost of resumption should be the value of the site only (see paragraph 796).
(4) Zoning of Areas.
811. The zoning of all built-up areas restricting them to a particular use would have the effect
of reducing considerably the values of land in certain areas. This measure we have recommended in
paragraph 183.
(b) Financial Assistance for Slum Clearance.
812. Even if the measures of zoning and of assessing compensation for resumed property previously
recommended were introduced, it is clear that the cost of providing dwellings on sites in inner areas
will be higher than for housing in outer areas.
813. Even allowing for higher density in inner areas, the economic rent for housing in such areas
will greatly exceed the economic rent for lower density housing in outer areas—therefore, in order that
the inner areas may be rebuilt, greater assistance per dwelling unit will have to be granted than for the
housing programme generally.
814. We consider that, as a general rule, it would be wrong from the social and economic points
of view to redevelop areas of obsolete housing in any way other than comprehensively. The retention
of a relatively small number of dwellings, excepting perhaps, as temporary quarters during the transitional
stage while rebuilding takes place, because they have not reached acute slum conditions, may obstruct
property redevelopment of the whole area, and may tend to lessen the advantages and amenities of the
new dwellings.
815. The principle of awarding extra assistance to housing in inner areas is not without precedent.
In England, under the 1930 Housing Act, a subsidy of £3 10s. per person rehoused was payable annually
for forty years by the Exchequer to the local government authority where such authority provided
dwellings in buildings of more than three storeys on land costing more than £3,000 per acre ; the general
subsidy for all other dwellings built by the authority was £2 ss. annually per person rehoused for forty
years. In later Acts financial assistance to dwellings on costly sites was substantially increased and
graduated per dwelling unit on the cost of the site as developed per acre.
816. We consider that in Australia the financial assistance to be granted for building on costly
sites in inner areas should be based on:
(a) the relation of the cost of the site (inclusive of all development) to the economic rent of
the dwelling units provided ; and
( b) the number of dwelling units provided on the site, which will be governed by the density
laid down for the particular area.
WE RECOMMEND that in the post-war period the Commonwealth Government should recognise
the clearance of slums as partially a national responsibility and, where slum clearance schemes are approved
by the Commonwealth Planning Authority, the Commonwealth Government should, in conjunction with
the State Governments and the local government authority or authorities concerned and/or benefited,
contribute to the loss sustained by such slum clearance on a basis to be determined by mutual agreement
in each particular case.


Part XVI. Community Facilities.
SUMMARY : A. Need for community facilities.
8. Standards of community facilities.
(a) General principles.
( b ) Minimum community facilities for new housing areas.
(c) Community facilities in built-up urban areas.
(d) Community facilities in rural areas.
C. Administration and finance.
(a) Administration.
(b) Capital cost.
(c) Cost of management.
D. Model community centres.
A. NEED FOR COMMUNITY FACILITIES.
818. Community facilities are aids to the development of community life. Our terms of reference
have limited our inquiries to the community in which people live, rather than the community in which
people work. Community facilities exclude working time activities ; they are, however, wider than
leisure-time interests, for they embrace health, educational and shopping activities. It is, however,
convenient for purposes of discussion to divide community facilities into two types :
(1) health, educational, religious and shopping facilities, for which some provision is normally
made and for which some finance is available through recognised channels ; and
(2) facilities for which little provision is normally made and for which financial responsibility
is not clear. This group includes recreational facilities, both physical and cultural, and
educational facilities for the pre-school child and adults.
819. It is difficult to define the scope of community facilities because the needs vary as between
different communities. There is, however, a definite minimum which will be needed in each area.
820. In the past, facilities of the first type have been provided either as a general service to the
community, as with the present health and educational services, or as the result of effort within the
community itself. There are, however, certain communities in which, through lack of initiative or
finance, these services are seriously lacking, these conditions being found in many closely built-up areas
in large towns. In all communities there are serious omissions in the field of provision for the pre-school
child and cultural activities for all age groups.
821. The deficiencies in many localities, as well as the gap between achievement and ideal in all
communities, may be due to lack of knowledge, interest or leadership. Sometimes the community is
too small and scattered to support the services. The need is often for more information and for provision
of finance.
822. Therefore, we consider that it is necessary for some outside authority to assist local activity
to give the lead in providing facilities and direction, and to stimulate residents to an active sense of
responsibility and a desire to participate in the management of their own activities.
823. Even where fairly adequate facilities do already exist there has been, generally, a lack of
co-ordination which has resulted in restricted community development. During the war there have
been many illustrations of the benefits achieved through an active community spirit. The Air Raid
Precaution Services, Red Cross, war committees and camouflage net-making groups have all provided wider
social contacts than previously, with obvious benefits to the spirit of co-operation of the community as
a whole. There is clearly a need for co-ordination of welfare and social organisations.
824. In new housing estates there will be special need to stimulate community development ;
these estates may possibly form a major part of post-war housing. In established communities some
social, educational and recreational organisations exist, but in new housing estates these bodies will have
to be developed. Residents moving into a new area will have broken old associations and will feel the
need to make new ones, and health, educational and shopping facilities should be provided when the area
is first occupied ; the development of recreational and cultural facilities in a new estate may, however,
be slow and outside assistance and advice will be required to stimulate organisation by local citizens.
825. We consider, therefore, that there will be a need for encouragement to be given to establish
community facilities as a part of all housing, whether this development is in the form of entirely new
housing estates or in the replanning of existing built-up areas. Therefore, WE RECOMMEND that
in planning all new areas and in replanning all built-up areas, land and buildings should be provided for
at least the minimum community facilities listed in paragraphs 831 and 834, and that Commonwealth
financial assistance should not be granted for any particular project unless and until conditions prescribed
by the Commonwealth Community Facilities Committee (see paragraph 842) are complied with.


826. We consider it most important to emphasise that, although recreational and social activity
should be stimulated and assisted by a central organisation, the motive force and the responsibility for
organisation must rest with the people of the locality concerned.
B. STANDARDS OF COMMUNITY FACILITIES.
(a) General Principles.
827. The State Housing Authority or its delegated authority will be responsible for the erection
of certain community buildings, and it will be desirable for the technical staff of the State Housing Authority
to maintain close liaison with other departments, such as the Departments of Health and Education, in
order to ensure that the buildings erected by these departments shall harmonise with the rest of the
housing project.
828. Minimum buildings only should be provided at first in a new housing estate. In the post-war
period restrictions may be necessary owing to the shortage of labour and material. While building
resources are in short supply a temporary or an incomplete building may be used. This will allow scope
for variation in the way in which the social life of the community may develop. Certain disused military
buildings may be available for these purposes.
829. In b uilt-up areas land for additional community facilities should be acquired, with due regard
to town-planning principles, for social activities already present and to provide for their extension. In
all cases local committees should advise on the work to be undertaken.
830. We consider, as a general principle, that in every scheme certain community facilities should
be established at the time of the erection of dwellings, and that space should be left for other facilities,
which may be built as local initiative becomes more conscious of the need for them and as more resources
become available.
( b) Minimum Community Facilities for New Housing Areas.
831. WE RECOMMEND that the minimum community facilities listed below, unless otherwise
determined by the State Community Facilities Committee, should be built at the same time as the
dwellings, and should be within reasonable distance of every dwelling ; these distances will vary in
accordance with the density of the population in the area concerned and the type of facility :
(1) shops (to provide day-to-day needs);
(2) playing areas;
(3) infant health and pre-school child welfare centres;
(4) meeting hall ; and
(5) schools.
832. We consider that without these particular facilities any housing development may be a
social failure. We do not feel competent to recommend the number of persons which should be served
by each of these facilities. Educational and health authorities have already some working basis for
provision of the facilities for which they are responsible. The variation in the size and density of existing
communities served by other facilities is so great that there can be no attempt to establish standards.
We consider that the numbers of each facility to be established in particular areas should be left to be
decided by the Community Facilities Committee in each State (see paragraph 841). After experience,
these committees should be able to establish some principles which would be of assistance in planning
facilities in other areas.
833. The provision of recreation areas is primarily a town-planning problem. For example, if
a new housing estate is established near a built-up area, existing playing fields and parks may partly serve
the new estate. Similarly the neighbouring area may be badly served by facilities and some allowance
may have to be made for the use of new facilities by people outside the particular area.
834. In addition to the provision of the facilities listed above WE RECOMMEND that in every
large housing project land should be allotted for the following facilities, leaving the development of the
areas, the provision of buildings and services to be provided as the need becomes apparent :
(1) Educational and Cultural.
(a) kindergartens and day nurseries;
(b) club and meeting rooms;
(c) small halls for use as little theatres, lecture halls and space for art and museum
exhibitions, orchestra, band, etc.;
(d) libraries, including children’s section.
(2) Recreational.
(a) small equipped play areas, located within close distance of dwellings;
(b) children’s playgrounds, equipped and supervised;
(c) playing fields for field games for youths and adults;
(d) gymnasia;
(e) swimming facilities;
(f) youth centre, including rooms for indoor sports, club activities, handicrafts and
music;
(g) canteen adjacent to or part of youth centre and/or meeting hall.
(3) Health. Adult health centre.
(4) Religious.
*92130—H


835. The allotting of sites for schools and religious purposes is one of local needs and town
planning ; these sites should be leased (see paragraph 312).
836. In areas of multi-storey dwellings there is greater need for provision of facilities for the
pre-school child, and for recreational activities for all ages. Clearly the absence of individual allotments
for recreation increases the need for community activity. We feel unable, however, to do more than
point to this as a guiding principle, and to refer the establishment of more detailed standards to the
Community Facilities Committees which we recommend (see paragraphs 841 and 842).
837. The buildings to house these activities should be placed according to their particular function,
but where permanent buildings are grouped some architectural harmony should be achieved in order
to create a centre symbolic of community enterprise.
(c) Community Facilities in Built-up Urban Areas.
838. The provision of community facilities in existing built-up areas is essentially one to be
considered in relation to the replanning of the whole area. A survey of existing facilities should be
undertaken concurrently with the town planning of the area. Extension of community facilities should
not, however, be delayed until the completion of a town plan. As soon as preliminary survey work is
completed, if necessary, land should be acquired with the object of providing for the deficiency in the
standard of facilities in comparison with that proposed for new housing areas (see also paragraphs 270
and 271).
(d) Community Facilities in Rural Areas.
839. The problem of the provision of adequate community facilities in areas of scattered population
differs from that of urban areas. Where there is a town which already forms a centre for health, education
and shopping, additional facilities in that town should provide for the population of the surrounding
country. In areas where the population is very scattered it may be possible to build recreational activities
around the local school and consideration should be given to the use of mobile educational units, library
and health services (see paragraphs 780 and 782).
C. ADMINISTRATION AND FINANCE.
(a) Administration.
840. Health and educational facilities are at present under the control of State departments.
Religious institutions are controlled by religious bodies, shops by private enterprise and recreational
facilities are mainly controlled by private persons or organisations with some local government
responsibility. Generally, the development of each type of facility has, however, been independent.
841. WE RECOMMEND that a Community Facilities Committee should be established in each
State to co-ordinate the work of organisations responsible for community facilities ; this Committee
should comprise representatives of the State Housing Authority, Departments of Health, Education,
and Local Government, Local Government Authorities and the National Fitness Council ; it should be
established in the manner most suited to the State Departmental organisation concerned, and should
maintain a close liaison with and co-opt when desirable, representatives of social welfare bodies concerned.
Its functions should be :
(1) collaboration with the State Housing Authority and/or the town planning authority in
allocating sites to community facilities;
(2) collaboration with the State Housing Authority, as the planning and constructing authority,
with respect to the facilities required;
(3) co-ordination of the services provided by different organisations, including social welfare
organisations;
(4) assistance in the establishment and maintenance of recreational and cultural facilities
required for each residential area;
(5) publicising the work which can be done by community organisations and the assistance
which can be provided;
(6) provide for training staff for supervising recreational and cultural facilities; and
(7) allocation of finance made available to assist the establishment and management of approved
community facilities.
842. WE RECOMMEND also that a Commonwealth Community Facilities Committee should
be set up under the Commonwealth Planning Authority or, pending its establishment, under the Ministry
of Post-War Reconstruction. The functions of the Commonwealth Community Facilities Committee
(1) to recommend and review, from time to time, the standard of the community facilities
required as a condition of financial assistance;
(2) to undertake and supervise research on community facilities in Australia and overseas and
disseminate information thereon;
(3) to allocate finance to approved State projects for community facilities; and
(4) to report periodically to the Commonwealth Planning Authority on the present and proposed
community facilities in the States.
We regard local initiative as the essential basis for community activity—facilities provided without loca
initiative are likely to be neglected or abused. We consider that the present policy of the National
Fitness Council of encouraging local initiative in the organisation of recreational and cultural activities
should be maintained, and that the State Community Facilities Committee encourage the local government
authority to form a committee of interested associations and citizens.


843. Because of the need to ensure continuity of work by any local Community Facilities
Committee we feel that this committee should include representation from the local government authority.
Ample scope must be available, however, for any member of the community to take the initiative in
stimulating the establishment of community facilities. Therefore, WE RECOMMEND that local
Community Facilities Committees should be set up as follows :
(1) if the local government authority is rating the community for the capital and/or running
costs of the community facilities, then such authority should have the primary responsibility
in sponsoring and administering the facilities, but the members of the community must be
represented on the local committee by persons additional to the members of the local
government authority ; but
(2) if the local government authority does not rate the community to raise the finance, then
the local government authority should be represented on the local committee for the
purpose of acting as a channel for finance and information, and providing stability and
continuity in the work of the committee.
( b) Capital Cost.
844. The financing of the capital cost of providing, controlling and managing community facilities
other than shops, schools and religious facilities, is in some States within the powers of the local government
authorities. However, many of these authorities in the past have not been able, nor willing to bear the
entire burden of financing these facilities. Furthermore, local responsibility for necessary finance might
preclude the establishment of these facilities in low-income areas.
845. This Commission considers that the social welfare of the people is the responsibility of the
whole community and, therefore, that the capital cost of these community facilities, other than shops,
schools and religious facilities, should be shared between the Commonwealth Government, the State
Governments and local government authorities.
846. The Commonwealth Government has already accepted in principle its responsibility for
some part of the cost of establishing satisfactory community facilities. Under the National Fitness Act
(Commonwealth) 1941, a National Fitness Fund has been established, from which the Minister of Health
is empowered to spend money for national fitness purposes generally. The organisation which we envisage
will involve considerably greater expenditure than the present National Fitness Fund, but we consider
that the principle of partial Commonwealth responsibility is essentially the same. The work involved
will, however, be correlated with that of State Departments and should eventually reduce State expenditure
on delinquency and health. Therefore, WE RECOMMEND that the capital cost of the land, buildings
and initial standard equipment required for the approved minimum standard of community facilities,
exclusive of shops, schools and religious facilities, should be shared equally by the Commonwealth
Government, the State Governments and the local government authorities ; in special circumstances
additional assistance may be granted by the Commonwealth Government on the recommendation of the
Commonwealth Community Facilities Committee.
847. We do not feel competent to estimate the probable cost of these facilities. The acquisition
of land should proceed with due regard to town planning principles as soon as the administrative machinery
has been established, but the erection of many of the necessary permanent buildings must await the
completion of the more urgent section of the post-war building programme.
(c) Cost of Management.
848. We have already emphasised the need for local initiative in the establishment of community
facilities and for local responsibility towards these facilities. Therefore, WE RECOMMEND that the
area served should be responsible for the cost of management of community facilities, exclusive of schools
and religious facilities ; under special circumstances, however, the State Community Facilities Committee
should be empowered to contribute towards this cost.
849. No general recommendation can be made on the question of payment for the use of
community facilities. In some cases, of course, principles are well established, e.g., for schools, hospitals,
infant health centres, and free libraries. Other cases will have to be considered as they arise, in the light
of the fundamental principle that these facilities are for the use of the people as a whole, and any charge
made for their use must never be so high as to restrict their use to those on middle or high incomes. A
usual overseas practice is to make a small charge, say, 2/6d. a year, for a whole family to become members
of a community centre and be able to use all its facilities, with the exception that a small additional charge
may be made for musical recitals, art shows or plays.
D. MODEL COMMUNITY CENTRES.
850. The provision of any but minimum recreational and cultural facilities is new to Australia.
The standards of facilities which we have recommended are based on overseas experience modified to
suit what we consider the needs of the people of Australia. This approach should be replaced by standards
based on experimental work carried out by trained persons. Therefore, WE RECOMMEND that the
Commonwealth Government should finance the establishment and operation of a model community
centre in each State. We suggest that in Tasmania the model centre might be attached to an area school,
since this type of centre would seem to be particularly well suited to closely-settled rural areas.
851. These model community centres should be operated as research projects, and more detailed
records should be kept than those required for ordinary administration. The research should be under
the direction of the Commonwealth Community Facilities Committee and, pending its establishment
under the control of the Ministry of Post-War Reconstruction. The results should be made available
to all interested State and local bodies.

A. GENERAL.
852. Throughout our inquiry and the taking of evidence certain subjects recurred which are not
closely related to the main heading we have already discussed in this report but on which we wish to
comment. We have, therefore, included in this Part a series of notes on unrelated subjects which we
consider to have a bearing on the housing of the people.
B. TIME PAYMENT AND HIRE PURCHASE AGREEMENTS.
853. There are many household and personal needs for which the average wage earner cannot
pay cash. It is because of this position that time payment and hire purchase agreements have become
so common. Provisions of this kind can do much to help the low income earner to spread his expenditure.
854. These systems have, however, been abused. High pressure salesmanship has often led to
the acceptance of commitments which cannot be met from income without sacrifice of expenditure on
necessities, involving at times inability to pay rent or make payments for home purchase. Generally,
interest charges have been high, and there have been few concessions during periods of sickness or
unemployment.
855. Some States introduced measures to control agreements of this kind prior to the war, and
since the war the Commonwealth Government has also introduced some controls. Regulations under
the National Security Act issued on 23rd March, 1942, provide for Commonwealth control of cash order
transactions and hire purchase agreements, these regulations being complementary to State legislation.
As from 27th March, 1942, persons conducting cash order business must obtain a license from the Federal
Treasurer, and from I Ith May, 1942, cash orders or loans by a cash order trader may not be issued except
at a licensee’s business premises. The regulations prohibit canvassing for cash orders and fix a
maximum premium and discount, minimum deposits and maximum periods of hiring. Where a cash order
or loan is issued to a married woman, her husband is not liable for repayment unless his written
consent was obtained prior to issue.
856. These regulations are wartime provisions designed to restrict unnecessary expenditure
and, therefore, unnecessary use of resources for civilian consumption. We consider, however, that it is
desirable that some control should be maintained after the war. More important, however, is the
provision of some means by which the low income earner may obtain advances to meet legitimate
expenditure without paying excessively for the accommodation. The small loans department which
has been opened by several banks provides an avenue for advances of this kind. We consider that the
government should foster this development and, if its extension is not rapid, that the Commonwealth
Bank should enter this field. If this were done the interest rate should be the coss of the money plus
reasonable expenses of management ; the aim should not be to make a profit but to render a service
to a section of the community which may need assistance, and thus to an extent not prejudice obligations
in respect of the home.
C. MARRIAGE LOANS.
857. One of the main large expenditures which have to be met by the average family is the expense
of first setting up a home. The provision of small loans at reasonable cost, which has been suggested
above, would help to meet this need. We consider that specific assistance should be granted on easy
terms for the purchase of furniture and household equipment of a durable nature and that to ensure
that only specified items are purchased, the loan should be expended by a system of orders. Advice on
purchases should be available to borrowers.


LANDSCAPE DEVELOPMENT.
Showing division of Area into :-
“A” Public space , contained within and including
footpaths.
“B” Front portion of each building site (area
between hedge and footpath ) added to “A”.
“C” Private space contained within hedges and
boundary fences.
Also showing—
“1” Orderly diffusion of trees and shrubs through-

AERIAL VIEW.
Showing orderly, spatial development of a site, comprising No. 12 building allotments, and the
advantages to be gained when tree and shrub planting is considered in relation to the total area.
The conjunction of the two sites shown on the sketch provides 1½ acres of open space adjacent to
No. 32 dwelling units.
The main access to the dwelling units is from the open space, on to which all units front.
Maintenance of this open space could be undertaken by the local authority.


D. LANDSCAPE LAYOUT.
858. In planning any government-financed housing area attention should be given not only to
the design* of the buildings but to the general landscape layout, with particular reference to the p anting
of trees One of the factors which detract from new housing projects is barrenness caused by lack of
trees and planting generally. The housing authority should take steps to plant well-developed trees
and shrubs as soon as the houses are completed. Where the cul-de-sac with park access type of subdivision
is used it is desirable that the maintenance of the frontage of each allotment back to the house alignment
should be arranged with the local government authority.
859. There are guiding principles which should be observed in planning the landscape layout of
any housing area :
(a) good areas of vision should be provided at traffic intersections;
(b) tree types should be carefully selected so as to avoid nuisance types which may cause trouble
to adjoining walls, pavings and drains;
(c) tree types should be adapted to the particular position in relation to the adjacent buildings,
e.g., so as not to block the view, shade rooms which require sunlight or prevent other growth
in the vicinity;
(d) trees should be chosen with attention to their suitability to the climate, to their value
as pattern makers, both planographic and cubical, to their texture, colour and intrinsic and
massed beauty;
(e) lawn areas should be property cultivated and graded;
(f) where structures cast a permanent shade on any public areas, these portions should be
used as garden beds;
( g ) jn enclosed areas trees should be placed so as to break up the level mass into areas too small
for vigorous games ; and
( h ) all fences and gates should be low and inconspicuous, with no fences in front of the dwellings.
860. We consider that a landscape maintenance department should be formed by each local
government authority or regional council. There should be a central nursery for the development of
trees, shrubs and seedlings. Contact should be maintained with government organisations concerned
with soil analysis, fertility, etc.
861. The collaboration of householders is essential for the preservation of the trees and shrubs,
and education in community appreciation and responsibility is necessary to achieve this.
862. The illustrations on pages 117 and 118 give suggested landscape treatment for a cul-de-sac
subdivision and an aerial view thereof.
E. COMMENT ON UTILITIES.
(a) Electric Energy.
863. I. General. Electric light and power, more than anything else, hold out the hope of help
to the housewife, as well as the promise of more attractive and comfortable homes.
864. Production and distribution of electric energy in Australia has increased notably since the
end of the last war, but is still a long way below what is necessary even on the present demand ; although
costs have been reduced in recent years by supply authorities, greater reductions in costs are to be desired
and would result in greater use of electric energy and allow it to be used more freely in the dwellings of
the people in towns and, also, more particularly in rural areas. The Commission supports the view
expressed by the Rural Reconstruction Commission in its First Report (Chapter VII) where it was stated
that the provision of electricity on the farms would do more to bridge the gap between town and country
life than any other single factor.
865. 2. Domestic Reticulation. In all closely-settled areas wiring should be undergrounded
because overhead wires are dangerous if allowed to get out of order, are unsightly, and interfere with
street trees. Placing cables in ducts underground is usual in business areas of towns, but Canberra
(Australian Capital Territory) is the only place where residential districts are so connected, and there
only on the main streets. Undergrounding of cables is standard practice in English housing estates, and
in the United States of America is common in modern housing developments. Costs of this system under
present conditions are high, but research into the use of new practices may reveal less expensive methods.
866. Multi-phase distribution in the streets and multi-phase service to the houses are strongly
recommended in residential districts by many supply authorities, but is only followed in isolated cases
in Australia. This method of wiring allows power-using fittings such as stoves, bath heaters and wash
boilers to be wired across phases and permits extra points to be installed easily in the future.
867. 3. Lighting. The Commission has noted with concern the poor standard generally of
domestic illumination in all parts of Australia. Both the quantity and quality of lighting in most houses
fall far below recommended standards in other countries.
868. Bare lamps producing glare and harsh shadows, light absorbing fittings, badly located outlets,
incorrectly tinted walls and ceilings as well as a general insufficiency of total illumination are common.
The creation of good “ seing conditions ” is as necessary in the homes of the people as it is in factories
and offices, especially in view of the effect of bad lighting on health. Doubtless, illumination will make
great advances after the war when fluorescent lighting may become cheap enough for use in dwelling
units.


869. Many houses in remote rural areas cannot be connected to supply mains because they are
too far from the nearest supply ; to connect them would cost too much either in reticulation or to provide
cables of suitable size.
870. Low voltage generating sets operated by a small engine or operated by a windmill and fitted
with storage batteries are used in some districts. The Commission considers that all small settlements
and remote farm houses should be supplied with electric light and suggests that the manufacture of efficient
generating plant, purchasable at a reasonable cost, be investigated so that generating sets could be standard
equipment in such settlements and in farm houses in remote areas where connection to the supply
authority’s main is not possible nor economical.
871. 4. Power. Concurrently with the demand for better lighting, there will be a demand
for more power for electric equipment in the home. The use of electric stoves will undoubtedly increase,
especially if costs be reduced. This also applies to hot water heaters and wash boilers. Smaller energy,
consuming equipment such as vacuum cleaners, floor polishers, clocks, irons, mixers and jugs are being
used in increasing numbers, many of them coming into almost universal use. The use of refrigerators
will become very much more common and a large number of them will be electrically operated.
872. 5. Radio. Provision for radio sets is necessary in all homes. Plug outlets and aerials for
radio sets together with the necessary precautions against electrical interference should be built into
the walls during construction.
873. 6. Cost and Maintenance of Equipment. The capital cost of much equipment has been
too high for the low income group of the community to buy at all freely. We consider that investigation
should be made into the production and installation of electrical equipment with a view to reducing the
cost. Main fittings such as stoves and hot water installations should be built in as integral portions of
the structure. Main distribution boards should be mass produced and they, together with conduits and
main fuses, should be built into the structure of the dwelling unit during erection, avoiding present
wasteful methods.
874. Supply authorities do not, with some exceptions, carry out servicing. The Commission
considers it would improve electrical services if servicing of consumers’ apparatus was carried out by all
supply authorities, who could keep stocks of standardised spare parts and a staff of skilled technicians—
this should reduce the cost of service to consumers.
875. 7. Cost of Electric Current. Costs in Australia vary in different areas, largely according
to the methods of production, availability of hydro-electric energy or coal, and distance from transmission
stations. The Commission considers that substantial reduction in the cost of electric energy is an urgent
need all over Australia, but more especially in rural areas.
876. Therefore, WE RECOMMEND that the use of electricity should be extended by the
following means :
(i) all State Governments be urged to take the action necessary to increase the production
and distribution of electric energy at a distribution cost that will enable all dwelling units,
except in remote districts not within an electric supply area, to be supplied with electricity
at a price within the means of the people, and in sufficient bulk that light and power consuming
equipment can be freely used;
(ii) State Housing Authorities, when building houses in areas out of reach of electric supply
authorities, instal electric generating sets of approved type, if available, at a reasonable
cost, in each dwelling unit as standard practice ; such sets shall be capable of lighting all
rooms and supplying power for minor current-using appliances such as irons, vacuum
cleaners, refrigerators and radios;
(iii) State Housing Authorities, in government-financed houses, should provide for a modern
standard of illumination in all rooms;
(iv) State Housing Authorities should require that all government-sponsored houses be wired
in a modern method, including multi-phase wiring ; conduits, fuse boxes, main distribution
boards, recessed switches and other fittings should be built in during the erection of the
walls, thus saving cutting and chopping walls after erection;
(v) all supply authorities should carry cables underground in streets when reticulating new
housing projects;
(vi) all supply authorities should service their consumers’ installations and fittings, carrying
stocks of spare parts in order to save costs and time in making repairs and replacements; and
(vii) further investigations should be made into the standardisation of electrical apparatus and
equipment so as to reduce not only the cost of manufacture but also the cost of servicing.
( b) Water Supply.
877. General. An ample supply of good water reticulated through the dwelling unit is a
necessity and, where this is available, cold water taps should be placed over the sink in the kitchen, over
each trough and copper in the laundry and connected to bath, shower and basin in the bathroom. In
addition, where a public supply is available, sufficient water points should be placed in the garden to
supply all needs.
878. Water for domestic use should be pure and soft, so if the supply is naturally hard the supply
authority should be required to soften the water to a defined standard.


879. In all towns that have grown rapidly, water supply authorities have had to make extensions
to their storage capacity and reticulation systems to meet the increasing demands from time to time.
Many complaints have been made from home owners in outer suburbs, particularly from returned soldiers
of the last war, that they have had difficulties in obtaining a water supply because their houses were in
new subdivisions not served with water. The Commission recognises that this unfortunate state of
affairs has been due to uncontrolled subdivision.
880. Effect of Slum Abolition on Water Supply. Experience in rehousing in the United
Kingdom has shown that when dwellers in sub-standard housing areas are moved into modern housing,
a big increase in water consumption takes place ; relatively a similar increase may be expected in Australia.
Not only is extra water used in the individual dwelling units, but the provision of communal facilities
such as swimming pools, gymnasia, child welfare clinics, kindergartens and canteens all increase water
consumption. The creation of parks and nature strips as well as playgrounds and gardens near new
housing groups also increase the demand on water supply.
881. Country Towns. Evidence from a number of large country towns showed that, in many
cases, their water storages and reticulation systems were not adequate, and would be seriously below
requirements if their towns were properly town planned and extensive housing programmes were carried
out.
882. WE RECOMMEND that all authorities whose functions include domestic water supply
immediately make a technical survey of water supplies with special reference to :
(i) the sources, quality and quantity of available supplies ; and
(ii) the need for improved or extended supplies.
New schemes to bring their water supply up to present and future needs for their areas should
be commenced immediately resources become available.
883. Tank Supplies. In many country areas it is not possible at present to provide and maintain
a sufficient piped supply of good water to all houses. Rain water should be collected from the roofs and
tank capacity should be ample, as mentioned in Appendix X, Division (ii).
884. Tanks should be so designed as to exclude mosquitoes and provision should be made so that
periodic tank cleaning is easily done. Tanks should be placed sufficiently high so that pipes can supply
kitchen sink, bath, basin and wash-troughs by gravity.
(c) Sewerage.
885. General. In theory, all waste from communities should be taken back to the land and
used for agricultural purposes. Many of the world’s oldest civilisations, like China, have followed this
practice for countless centuries. Difficulties of hygiene, transport and distribution, as well as cost, render
any such natural economy out of the question for a large modern town.
886. Modern towns universally remove household drainage and sewage in water-borne systems
of piping, carrying the waste matter plus a large volume of water to suitable plants for treatment and
disposal of the effluent.
887. Various methods of disposal, such as septic, anti-septic, discharge into sea or rivers, or
dispersal on broad areas of graded land are used. These disposal plants do not concern housing, but are
a direct concern of regional planning and must be considered when preparing a master plan for any town
or large housing development.
888. Where a town does not have a water-borne system of sewage disposal, difficulties of various
kinds are met. The double pan system of night soil removal is extensively used. Unless containers
are fly-proof and clearances are frequent, the objections are obvious, especially in tropical and sub-tropical
areas. Individual septic tanks are frequently used, and are suitable under certain conditions. Anti-
septic systems are common both in Europe and America in areas where water is in short supply, but have
not been much used in Australia.
889. In all closely settled areas without water-borne sewerage systems the disposal of sullage
water is a very difficult and unsolved problem. The Commission saw in many towns sullage water lying
in street channels and in unmade roads and lanes ; this unhygienic arrangement should not be allowed
to continue, and we consider the Experimental Building Station should be asked to investigate and report
on the effective treatment of sullage water.
890. Sewerage Systems in Australian Towns. Even in the capital cities, the Commission
noted that many outer areas are not sewered ; like other defects of planning, this points to the absence
of a town plan for each town and emphasises the evils of uncontrolled development. The scattered
settlement in many outer suburban areas makes sewerage costly and this, as well as the growth of the
population beyond the capacity of the treatment plants, has caused delays in extending sewerage
reticulation. In some cases, closely populated suburbs are still without sewerage.
891. Large country towns in most States have sewerage systems, though many of them do not
cover the whole town. The Commission, however, noted with regret that many towns with substantial
populations and with every expectation of growing are still without sewerage systems. The causes of
the failure of many communities to provide this essential service or a satisfactory substitute should be
rectified as soon as possible.
892. The scattered settlement in some towns and ribbon development in many others will make
sewerage reticulation a difficult and costly matter, and present problems requiring the collaboration of
town planners and sanitary engineers.


893. Septic Tanks. Properly designed and constructed septic tanks are suitable in many
positions where sewerage installations are not possible. An ordinary septic tank is suitable for farm
houses or for houses with ample ground, suitable soil and adequate water supply. If used in closely built-
up areas, such as for an hotel, shop, picture theatre, and a group of houses in small towns, each tank should
also have a suitable filter and a chlorinator. A filter needs frequent attention and a chlorinator must be
looked at every few days. For these reasons some authorities are not favourable to septic tanks in
built-up areas.
894. We urge more use of septic tanks, properly designed and constructed, in positions where
a general sewerage system is not suitable, where water is adequate and where the soil permits absorption.
We consider that these tanks should be built under supervision in accordance with standards laid down
by State health authorities where this is not being done at present, and further, that each installation
should be registered.
895. WE RECOMMEND that, in respect of sewerage, septic tanks and drainage :
(i) State Housing Authorities should be urged to consult local government or other sewerage
authorities concerned prior to planning any housing projects to ensure that sewerage will
be available to all houses or to make other arrangements for disposal of the sewage by modern
means;
(ii) action should be taken to ensure that all closely settled communities of, say, 1,000 people
or over have some modern method of sewage disposal;
(iii) all septic tank installations should be constructed to a standard defined by the State Housing
Authority and be registered ; and
(iv) the Experimental Building Station be asked to investigate the effective treatment of sullage
water where sewerage systems are not installed.
(d) Refuge Disposal.
896. General. The collection and disposal of refuse in closely built-up areas is one of the functions
of local government authorities. In addition to the ordinary refuse from residential areas, special types
of refuse and waste from industrial undertakings have to be disposed of.
897. Some local government authorities have their own plant and fleet of vehicles, others group
together to form trusts and some let the work by contract to private individuals. In some districts
properly designed destructors are erected, but many local government authorities dump the rubbish
in gullies, old brick pits or other suitable places, covering each layer with a deposit of earth ; unless this
is done properly rats and flies become a nuisance.
898. Single Dwelling Units. In well organised districts garbage tins of standard type with
vermin-proof lids are used and clearances are at least twice a week. The vehicles used are specially
designed with sectional covers to prevent light rubbish being blown about by wind.
899. The Commission has, however, noted a number of districts where unsatisfactory containers,
often without lids, are common, and ordinary drays or lorries without covers are used. We urge that
all local government authorities concerned should use properly designed vehicles and should insist on
householders using standard garbage tins with vermin-proof lids. We also emphasise the need for frequent
clearances, at least twice weekly in towns.
900. Multi-Storey Dwellings and Hostels. Garbage removal is a difficult problem in
blocks of flats and other multi-storey dwellings. Garbage tins should not be used in buildings over two
stories high. A common practice in flat construction is to build an incinerator in the basement with
a combined smoke stack and chute. Each flat has a hopper designed to prevent leakage of fumes ; tenants
are required to packet their rubbish dry in paper.
901. The “ Garchey ” system, used to a limited extent in England, consists of a special sink in
each apartment from which rubbish is carried by a suction pump to a drier, thence passing to an incinerator.
902. A recent method in the United States of America consists of a special sink in each apartment
containing a grinder, electrically operated, which reduces all rubbish, even bones, but not tins, to a liquid
state which can then pass into the sewer.
903. The cost of both the last two systems may at present be too high in Australia to permit of
general use, but we consider that their installation in multi-storey dwellings should be investigated.
904. We are of the opinion that all State Housing Authorities should arrange for a hygienic system
of refuse disposal to be instituted to serve each group of dwelling units constructed by them.
(e) Means for Cooking.
905. Fuels used for cooking in Australian homes vary considerably in different areas. Coal is
naturally used adjacent to coal mines as well as in many towns where transport makes it available. Wood
is used in many areas, but its use is declining because of the diminishing supplies near centres of population
and the competition with more modern fuels. In Victoria, brown coal briquettes are extensively used
Coke is used in some areas. Oil fuels of various types have, as yet, only slight use.
905. Coal gas is manufactured in a large number of towns, is o\ a high standard in most places an
s used by a large number of housewives in preference to any othe means of cooking. Electric energy
as a means of cooking has become popular and is likely to be increasingly used, especially if the cost of
equipment, installation and charges for current can be reduced.


907. Hard fuels like coal and wood require stoves built into brick, concrete or stone recesses
with solid flues and chimneys. In addition these fuels require constant labour in making fires and cleaning
stoves whereas the use of gas and electricity saves labour and permits of better control of the heat. Gas
stoves’require flues to remove fumes but an electric stove can be placed in a room without any flue
combustion stoves burning coke have been introduced in recent years ; although the
capital cost of these stoves is very high, great economy of fuel is shown.
908. It is probable that precision stoves, burning various fuels, will be available within a few years
and will reduce the cost of household cooking considerably. Other possible advances are g reate *' use
of oils and the use of compressed gas. The Commission considers improved means of cooking should
be investigated, aiming at more exact control of heat, economy of fuel and reduction of labour for the
housewife. „
( f ) Room Heating.
909 Space heating of houses has not received much attention in Australia in comparison with
many other countries ; this is probably due to the mild climate. In the southern States and some high
areas in other States, provision should be made for space heating during co d weather. The need for
heating has been recognised in the large towns ; all modern office blocks, banks, factories as well as halls,
and theatres, are now heated, generally by low pressure hot water systems.
910 Most old houses are provided with one or more brick chimneys with primitive open fireplaces
which consume large amounts of fuel, creating heat which mostly rises up the chimney Many
comparatively modern homes still rely entirely on grates and open fireplaces, requiring brick fireplaces
and chimneys taking up large areas of the room, using the fuel in a most inefficient manner and not
effectively heating even the room in which they are placed. This heating method involves constant labour
911. Many houses use more fuel to keep a fire going in one room than would warm the whole
house if burnt in a modern system. The use of slow combustion stoves burning coke or coal is an
improvement, and these are being increasingly installed.
912. In the United States of America there has been a recent development of central heating from
a small low-cost stove using low-combustion solid fuel. This stove, placed in the utility room, heats an
air chamber located round the main flue and from this chamber the heated air is carried in ducts to each
room in the house ; grills are provided in each room through which the heated air percolates. This
form of heating together with other forms of slow combustion stoves, should be investigated with a view
to its application in low-cost housing in Australia.
913. Electric radiators and gas fires have a limited use ; so, also, have space heaters of small size
using electricity, gas, or other fuels.
914. More attention to the heating of homes is needed and, in this connection, better insulation
is required, especially for ceilings in single-storey dwellings.
(g) Air Conditioning.
915. Full air conditioning consists of washing the air, then regulating its temperature and moisture
content relative to the external conditions from time to time and supplying it in correct proportions
to every part of the building treated. Although it will probably be a long time before many buildings
in Australia are completely air conditioned, partial air conditioning is coming into general use in hospitals,
theatres and other buildings. Air conditioning in residential units has been introduced in a number of
tropical and sub-tropical countries, notably in the United States of America.
916. There are many parts of Australia where cooling and circulating the air would be of great
benefit in many buildings. Accordingly, WE RECOMMEND that partial air conditioning or cooling
be considered by State Housing Authorities in tropical and sub-tropical districts for certain rooms in
dwelling units and for community facility buildings, and that the matter of cooling dwelling units, either
mechanically or otherwise, should be considered by the Experimental Building Station.
F. KITCHEN AND LAUNDRY.
(a) Kitchen.
917. A modern kitchen, being the most used room in the house, should be efficient and attractive
to offset any drudgery and monotony —in short, it should be a congenial place to work in with a pleasant
outlook.
918. The planning of the various fittings in the kitchen should be in logical sequence in regard
to their functions. One suggestion out of many that could be designed is illustrated by a sketch on page
124 of what might be considered a suitable arrangement. A“ U ” shaped arrangement of the working
unit is indicated, forming a bay or alcove, with a window —its layout is planned to reduce steps and
movement. Cupboards are placed on the left for foodstuffs with external ventilation, and on the right
for crockery. The drawers below the servery are two-way. The stove is shown on the left and the
refrigerator on the right, at the respective ends of the food preparation slabs. It is advisable to set back
the skirting forming the base of the lower cupboards to provide toe space.
919. The service hatch should be adjacent to or available for access from the kitchen, and it is
important that it should be in the shade.
920. The wall surfaces and ceiling of kitchens should be oil painted, preferably with enamel finish
to allow them to be washed. The areas immediately above sink and around cooking appliances should
be tiled, or surfaced with some modern impervious material.

$2l. Cupboards to accommodate perishable food, such as vegetables, require through ventilation ;
this can be achieved by circular holes backed by fly wire at skirting level, with shelves of framed chain
wire, and a small outlet vent at top of cupboard.
922. There should be good light on all working surfaces, and direct light on the stove is essential.
In an electrically fitted kitchen, power points should be placed at suitable positions. Provision may be
made for an exhaust fan, especially in warmer climates.
923. The kitchen is a small “ factory modern factories are equipped with modern appliances ;
great improvements in mechanical equipment for food preparation and other kitchen work are expected.
( b ) Laundry.
924. The provision of adequate laundries for dwelling units has not received sufficient attention
in many parts of Australia—in some cases there is no proper laundry and the boiler, and often the tubs,
are placed out in the yard. Washing and ironing clothes is a constant task for the housewife, and she
should be able to take advantage of modern methods and appliances.
925. Where individual laundries are provided for each house, either as a separate building or
as a roomattached to the dwelling, they are often cramped in size and ill-equipped the most comnnon
fittings being a copper and a pair of troughs. Modern laundering equipment can usually only be provided
by the very well-to-do, nor can its provision be justified when it is normally only used for a few hours
per week. As most individual dwelling units will probably continue the present practice of using individual
laundries, we consider more attention should be paid to the appliances provided and, while it will not be
possible to provide expensive modern equipment in all laundries, some improvements should be aimed at,
especially in the provision of some means of drying clothes in wet weather in districts where there is
a high rainfall and in areas of high humidity. We suggest that in climatic zones, determined by the btate
Housing Authority, all dwelling units should be provided with drying cupboards, heated with electricity,
gas or other suitable fuel.
926 In modern multi-storey dwellings it is customary to provide group laundries, generally one
laundry being provided for each four flats or apartments. In addition to troughs and copper, an electric
washing machine, an ironing machine and a drying cupboard can be provided, although it is better practice
to provide each unit with a drying cupboard. We consider this practice could well be followed in modern
housing estates, whether the dwelling units are individual or multi-storey dwellings. Each laundry cou d
serve four units. In the case of individual cottages, the laundry could be located so as to be accessible
from each rear yard or from a drying yard common to the four units. Modern labour-saving equipment
could be installed and a roster arranged, the power being supplied through a slot meter.
927. Management and maintenance should not present great difficulties, especially in government-
financed housing estates.
928. Even a group of four dwelling units may not justify the installation of all the labour-saving
appliances now available, but a communal laundry built as a community facility in a neighbourhood unit
or a small country town, could be fitted with such items as a modern washing machine, dehydrator, large
drying room and an ironing machine. The provision of communal laundries in housing estates is common
practice in many parts of Europe, either designed so that the occupiers can use the plant individually
according to a roster, or can have their washing and ironing done at very moderate charges.
G. CO-OPERATIVE FLATS.
929. It has been suggested to the Commission that the principle of co-operation in relation to
housing might be extended to co-operative building and ownership of flats. This has been done in other
countries, where it is also possible to have private ownership of individual flats in a block with a separate
title for each flat. In the case of co-operative ownership of flats, there would be a committee of manage-
ment, and borrowing and administration would proceed as with present co-operative building societies.
The main difference in the suggestion made to us is that it is not proposed that a title of ownership should
ever pass to the individual. If he desired to leave the neighbourhood, his shares in the co-operative society
would be bought by the society and re-issued to someone else, who would then assume tenancy of the
dwelling vacated.
930. There are many merits in this proposal. We see no objection to the extension of the
principle of co-operation to this type of dwelling. We have not, however, found evidence of any great
public demand for this form of ownership and we consider that public demand should be present before
there should be government sponsorship for a movement of this kind. Should this demand arise, the
government might be prepared to extend to these societies whatever assistance is made available to other
co-operative building societies.
H. REAL ESTATE BUREAU-
-931. At present in large towns there is a large number of estate agents, and it is impossible for
the home seeker to obtain, without considerable inconvenience, any comprehensive information about
the type of housing vacant or property for sale in a number of different districts or even throughout one
district.
932. This is not merely a symptom of the housing shortage under war conditions. Frequently
the person who is seeking a home would be willing to live in any of a number of districts, but has no means
of finding out, without considerable cost and loss of time, what accommodation is available in these
districts ; this position may be rendered more difficult after the war.


933. There is thus a general need for a central real estate bureau, which could give information
regarding the vacant housing and property for sale in different districts throughout the whole town.
It is not suggested that a bureau of this kind would or could replace the local estate agents. We emphasise,
however, that it would be of assistance to these local agencies, as well as to the home seeker, if the local
agencies kept the central agency informed of the properties on their books, so that this central agency
could refer to the individual agent, persons whom the accommodation might suit. There should be a
reduction in work for the local agent, and a reduction in time and irritation for the homeseeker. The
most satisfactory procedure might be for a central bureau of this kind to be established by the Real Estate
Institute as a service to its members and to the general public. There should be little difficulty in collecting
in small fees for the information supplied, a sufficient amount to cover the expenses of the bureau.
934. Should the Real Estate Institute be unwilling to undertake the service, we are of the opinion
that the State Housing Authority should give consideration to setting up a bureau of this kind as part
of its functions.
I. REGISTRATION OF BUILDERS.
935. Much evidence has been given to the Commission advocating registration of builders, so
as to give some assurance that persons undertaking building work are competent to carry it out ; it was
contended that builders should not only be efficient in workmanship but also should possess reasonable
financial resources to carry out the work, thus obviating worry to suppliers of materials and owners.
936. In Western Australia builders undertaking any building work costing more than £4OO are
required to be registered under the “ Builders’ Registration Act, 1939 ” to obtain registration under
the Act a person must have attained the age of twenty-one years and satisfy the Board appointed under
that Act that he has :
(a) completed the prescribed course of training and passed the prescribed examination ; or
( b) had at the time of passing of the Act been trading as a builder or supervisor of building for
not less than two years and that he is competent to carry out and supervise building work.
937. Power is given to the Board to cancel or suspend registration of any person for conviction
of any crime or misdemeanour, for any negligence or incompetence in connection with the performance
of any contract, or for being guilty of any fraudulent conduct in carrying out or completion of any contract.
938. No financial qualification is required for registration under the Act, which several witnesses
contended was a deficiency ; otherwise, there was general agreement that the Act was working
satisfactorily, had effected an improvement in the standard of building in that State, and gave a measure
of protection to suppliers of materials and persons employing builders.
939. Under the Canberra Building Regulations, no person shall undertake or execute any work
as a building contractor in the Australian Capital Territory unless he is the holder of a builder’s licence ;
to obtain a builder’s licence an application must be lodged with the proper authority together with
certificates as to ability of the applicant as a builder from two architects qualified to be registered under
the Canberra Building Regulations and a letter from a banker indicating that the applicant’s financial
position is satisfactory, and, also, a certificate from three householders of the same town that they have
known the applicant for a stated number of years and that they believe him to be a person of good fame
and character, and to be a fit person to have a builder’s licence. The high standard of work in the Australian
Capital Territory and the general absence of difficulty in having builders complete their jobs satisfactorily
are claimed to be consequent largely on the licensing of builders.
940. In Victoria, the Housing Commission calls for applications from builders desirous of tendering
for contracts from the Commission ; when these applications are received the financial standing, ability
and reliability of each builder is ascertained and those considered suitable are registered ; when contracts
are to be let, these builders are circularised—no others may tender ; the list is continuously brought up
to date. The Commission claims that this system of control has worked satisfactorily. The State Advances
Corporation of Queensland follows a somewhat similar procedure and, in consequence, has had little
trouble with satisfactory completion of contracts.
941. We are impressed with the need of some control to afford protection to persons employing
builders, so as to ensure that the work entrusted to builders is carried out satisfactorily and in a
tradesmanlike manner and, also, to raise the standard of construction ; accordingly, WE RECOMMEND
that each State enact legislation relating to the qualifications and registration of builders.


Part XVIII. Summary of Recommendations.
942. WE RECOMMEND that :
1. Surveys of housing be made as follows :
(1) the first preliminary estimate made through State authorities (see paragraph 131)
should be followed by sample surveys in areas where this seems desirable ; and
(2) a full housing census should be commenced about one year after the end of the war,
preferably in conjunction with a general census. (paragraph 132)
2. The continuance, for a period after the war, of government control of land prices and
transfers investment, prices and production of building materials, rents and the issue of permits for
building/ (paragraph 143)
3. Permits in respect of housing (new construction, improvements and/or maintenance to
existing dwelling units) be issued in accordance with government policy by local government
authorities under the direction and supervision of the State Housing Authority, but that where
housing projects involving construction of group estates by government or semi-governrr,ent
authorities have been approved in the State allocation of housing, permits be not required.
(paragraph 152)
4. The Commonwealth Government should take an active part in housing. (paragraph 159)
5. Legislation be enacted that on the foreshores in town areas :
(i) no further alienation of land be permitted ;
(ii) no building, or rebuilding, be permitted, except with the consent of the State Planning
Authority ; and
(iii) when and where buildings be demolished the land be resumed to a distance and to an
extent to be determined. (paragraph 179)
6. Zoning should be reinforced by power to declare “ housing development areas ” and to
control subdivision of land as set out in Divisions I and 2, Part VII, of the Model Housing Act (Appendix
VI). (paragraph 181)
7. Conferences between the Commonwealth and the States be held to discuss :
(1) the enactment of regional and town planning legislation ; and
(2) pending (I), actual or visual zoning of areas to be developed for housing, reinforced
by the power to declare “ housing development areas ”. (paragraph 183)
8. A Commonwealth Planning Authority should be established by legislation and be subject
to the Minister charged with the administration of national planning. (paragraph 200)
9. The general functions of the Commonwealth Planning Authority should be, inter alia :
(1) to survey, investigate and report upon the physical and economic resources of Australia ;
(2) to co-ordinate the work being planned in existing Commonwealth Departments and
by State Departments (see paragraphs 204-206);
Note. —This will be particularly necessary in the immediate post-war
period, in view of the probable shortage of some resources and the need
for re-establishing defence personnel and war workers.
(3) to formulate a plan to develop primary and secondary industries, national works,
housing, the general economic structure of the community and, in particular, to foster
and encourage regional and town planning (see paragraphs 190-197) ;
(4) to maintain contact with all organisations concerned with planning so that planning is
not imposed from the top but takes place simultaneously through the various bodies
concerned ;
(5) eventually, to direct the planning of existing Commonwealth Departments and to
advise State Governments so that the plans of different sections will agree with the
general plans for the Commonwealth ; and
(6) to supervise the activities of the proposed Commonwealth Community Facilities
Committee (see paragraph 842). (paragraph 202)
10. The particular functions of the Commonwealth Planning Authority in the housing field
should be :
(1) to relate housing policy to national activities ;
(2) to exercise such co-ordination and control as will ensure, according to needs, the
proper distribution of building resources between all forms of building ;
(3) to consider the programme of Commonwealth and State works, including housing ;
(4) in collaboration with the Commonwealth Housing Authority, to assess the size of the
housing programme for the Commonwealth and its allocation to the States and
Commonwealth territories ; and
(5) to consider, in collaboration with the Commonwealth Housing Authority, appeals
from any State or local housing body against the decision of the State Planning Authority
or State Housing Authority. (paragraph 203)


11. Density and siting should be governed by the following principles :
(1) In an area of single dwelling units the maximum net density shall be eight dwelling
units per acre, subject to the following :
(i) the proportion of allotment covered by building shall not exceed one-third of
the total area;
(ii) the allotment shall not be less than 4,500 square feet, with a minimum width at
position where dwelling is erected of 50 feet;
(iii) in temperate zones the living room and main bedroom of each unit shall have
windows capable of admitting sunlight for a period of at least one hour between
9 a.m. and 3 p.m., mid-winter.
(2) In an area of attached dwelling units the maximum net density shall be eleven dwelling
units per acre, subject to the following :
(i) the proportion of unit site covered by buildings shall not exceed one-third;
(ii) the unit site shall not be less than 3,600 square feet per dwelling unit;
(iii) in temperate zones the living room and main bedroom of each unit shall have
windows capable of admitting sunlight for a period of at least one hour between
9 a.m. and 3 p.m., mid-winter.
(3) In areas of multi-storey dwellings of more than two storeys in height the maximum
net density of dwelling units on any area shall be forty dwelling units per acre, subject
to the following :
(i) the proportion of unit site covered by buildings shall not exceed one-third;
(ii) in temperate zones the living room and main bedroom of each unit shall have
windows capable of admitting sunlight for a period of at least one hour between
9 a.m. and 3 p.m. in mid-winter;
(iii) buildings shall not be erected in such a way that they reduce to less than one hour
between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. in mid-winter the period in which sunlight has access
to the whole windows of the living room and main bedroom of dwelling units in
adjacent buildings;
(iv) the minimum distance from street alignments shall not be less than 15 feet. The
minimum distance from side boundaries or existing buildings shall not be less than
20 feet ; for each storey above three storeys the building shall be set back a further
3 feet ; and
(v) the location and siting of multi-storey dwellings in respect to individual unit sites
should be subject to the approval of the State Planning Authority regarding density
distribution.
Note. —The above recommendation is general and should apply to all
government-sponsored housing (which includes government-financed
housing), and should be a condition of financial assistance to government-
financed housing. (paragraph 233)
12. In respect of regional and town planning :
(1) each State have included in its town planning legislation adequate provision to plan or
replan the whole or any part of a town;
(2) the Commonwealth Government should subsidise any approved local government
authority, group of authorities or regional council in a replanning scheme, provided
that the Commonwealth Planning Authority has first approved thereof ; and
(3) the Commonwealth Government make loan money available for approved replanning
schemes. (paragraph 278)
13. The Commonwealth Government should establish a National School of Physical Planning
and that the details, theory and other relevant matters should be considered by a special committee
appointed for the purpose. (paragraph 288)
14. The Commonwealth Government should invite to Australia a regional and town planner
of professorial rank to take up a position directing the National School of Physical Planning and, also,
giving technical advice to the government on planning problems. (paragraph 290)
15. A conference be held with the States with a view to establishing a statutory valuing
authority that will pursue a uniform policy of valuation by adopting and using the same basic principles.
(paragraph 302)
16. Land values should be pegged on the basis of values as at 10th February, 1942, which is
the date prescribed by the National Security (Economic Organisation) Regulations, for the control
of land sales. (paragaph 305)
17. The Commonwealth Government set up a special committee to investigate land
nationalisation, with special reference to a basis for land valuation under nationalisation.
(paragraph 310)
18. Land resumed by the government for development purposes should be disposed of on
perpetual lease tenure and not by sale as freehold. (paragaph 312)


19. The matter of an increment (betterment) tax be also included in the terms of reference
of the special committee recommended to inquire into land nationalisation (see paragraph 310) to
be Imposed either as an Interim measure prior to land nationalisation or as an alternative thereto
(paragraph 315).
20. The following provisions be made in respect of acquisition of land for housing purposes .
(a) the relevant departments or authorities should be given absolute right to resume or
acquire land for specific housing purposes;
(b) compensation for resumption or acquisition should be based on the valuation of the
statutory valuing authority (see paragraphs 300-305);
(c) the owner or other interested party should have the right to appeal against the
compensation proposed to an authority composed of persons experienced in the
valuation of land ; each party should bear its own costs;
(d) the resuming authority should have the right, at any time before the acceptance of
compensation, to cancel the resumption upon payment of costs incurred ; and
(e) the title of land resumed or acquired should pass to the authority immediately after
the publication of the notice in the Government Gazette. (paragraph 324)
21. As soon as practicable the States should be invited to confer with the Commonwealth
with respect to :
(1) total quantity of building land already held by State Housing Authorities, and its
location in general terms;
(2) proportion of land in (I) which is subdivided and provided with public utilities so that
building may be commenced immediately;
(3) any extension of the powers of State Housing Authorities necessary to enable them to
acquire or reserve the land needed;
(4) finance required if additional land is to be acquired immediately ; and
(5) manpower, especially technical staff, and materials required by State authorities in
order to prepare the land for building by subdividing and providing necessary public
utilities. (paragraph 326)
22. The State authorities be given whatever assistance is deemed necessary to enable them,
with due regard to town planning principles, to acquire and prepare sufficient land for the housing
programme approved for the first post-war year. (paragraph 327)
23. Commonwealth responsibility should take the form of sponsoring :
(a) housing programme, to be undertaken as soon as war conditions and available building
resources permit, in order to afford some immediate relief of the acute housing shortage
(Immediate Relief Programme);
( b ) large-scale housing programme to be undertaken immediately the war ends (Immediate
Post-War Programme) ; and
(c) long-term programme and a permanent housing plan to prevent a recurrence of the
present housing conditions (Long-Term Programme and a Permanent Housing Plan).
(paragraph 329)
24. The post-war housing programmes should cover the numbers of new dwelling units
stated below, in addition to essential and urgent repairs to existing dwellings :
(1) the size of any immediate relief programme undertaken must depend entirely on the
building resources available, but should be as large as war needs permit;
(2) in the immediate post-war programme the target should be the erection of 50,000
dwellings by the end of the first post-war year, extending by the third post-war year
to 80,000 dwelling units per annum;
(3) this should be followed by a long-term programme and a permanent housing plan of
80,000 dwelling units per annum maintained until the greater part of the housing shortage
has been removed, sub-standard dwellings modernised or replaced and slum clearance
well in hand. (paragraph 339)
25. Pending a detailed housing survey, the following procedure should be adopted for
distribution of housing between States :
(a) the number of dwelling units to be built should first be allocated between the States
proportionately to pre-war population ; and
(b) the allocation between States should then be modified, according to the availability
of resources and the urgency of need as disclosed by the preliminary housing survey.
(paragraph 348)
26. Existing government housing authorities should undertake building during the immediate
relief period and should build a large number of dwellings for rental. (paragraph 350)
27. Permits should be given during the immediate relief period for the construction of a
limited number of dwellings for ownership. (paragraph 352)
28. A high priority in allotment of dwellings in the housing programme should be given to
those on rural properties who have no dwellings or are living in sub-standard dwellings ; detailed
surveys should be of considerable assistance in arriving at the number needed. (paragraph 359)
*02130—1


29. A Commonwealth Housing Authority be set up under the control of a Minister to
administer housing policy as determined by the Commonwealth Government to recommend financial
assistance to housing authorities for housing purposes and to co-ordinate all housing activities in
Australia. (paragraph 372)
30. The main functions of the CommonwealthfHousing Authority should be :
(1) in collaboration with the Commonwealth Planning Authority to implement and co-
ordinate housing throughout the Commonwealth, including social welfare in relation
to housing;
(2) to receive, through the Commonwealth Planning Authority, the proposed housing
programmes of the Commonwealth and the States, and to recommend to the Common-
wealth Planning Authority the size of the annual housing programme, and after approval
by the Commonwealth Planning Authority to allocate such programme between the
States;
(3) to examine proposed housing projects, where Commonwealth financial assistance
is desired, to ensure that the plans comply with Commonwealth standards for town
planning, community facilities and housing;
(4) if necessary, to consult the authorities of the Commonwealth or any State in connection
with any modification of its housing programme;
(5) from a fund created for the purpose to make loans, grants and/or subsidies, on conditions
prescribed, to housing authorities for approved housing projects;
(6) to control general standards for government-sponsored housing;
(7) to prescribe general conditions for allocation of priorities and the issue of permits in
respect of housing;
(8) to supervise through Commonwealth and State Housing Authorities the allocation of
priorities for government-financed housing, and the issue of permits for private domestic
building;
(9) to make arrangements with appropriate authorities for the provision of the necessary
building materials and labour to carry out approved housing programmes;
(10) to supervise the carrying out of the conditions attached to any financial assistance
granted by the Commonwealth by check inspections of projects and/or buildings and
by check audits;
(11) to initiate housing and social surveys and to collect and distribute statistics and
information on housing;
(12) to assist housing authorities by making available the results of research and the advice
of technical officers;
(13) to determine maximum dwelling unit costs for government-financed projects;
(14) to promote general publicity for better housing ; and
(15) to delegate any of its powers. (paragraph 376)
31. Housing in each State should be controlled by a State Housing Authority, which should
be the supreme body for housing in the State and be subject to the control and direction of a Minister
on matters of policy, and that the objects, constitution and powers of such authority to be established
by legislation should, inter alia , be as follows :
Objects.
(1) To improve existing housing conditions ; and
(2) To provide adequate and suitable housing accommodation for persons of limited means,
and certain other persons not otherwise adequately housed.
Constitution.

local government authority concerned, but power of dismissal should rest with either the State
Department of Health or the State Housing Authority. (paragraph 405)
33. Semi-government bodies, building societies, friendly societies and other institutions
approved by governments should be guaranteed by the governments against loss in respect of

and the difference between the economic and the standard payment should be made up by a
government subsidy. (paragraph 507):
49. Where the economic rent of government-financed housing exceeds one-sixth of the
family income as calculated in Appendix XII, the Commonwealth Government should contribute

* (Majority recommendation—see minority recommendation, page 137).


56 The standards for size of allotment, site coverage, accommodation and equipment, set
out in Appendix X, Division (II), should be the standard for government-sponsored
57 Building of government-sponsored dwellings should be restricted to the standards set
out in Appendix X, Division (ii), during the early post-war period, while the housing: sh^ ta S e
acute and building resources are limited. (paragrapn o ;
58 All government-sponsored housing should be not less than the approved standard,
but housing for purchase may exceed it to a percentage of the total cost to be determined from t'me
to time by agreement between the Commonwealth and State Housing Authorities ; this P erc< r n j£|®
will vary with the local conditions in the area concerned. (paragrapn ozz)
59 In regard to improvement of housing conditions, whether such housing be owner-occupied
or rented, and be in city, town or rural areas, each State should enact legislation :
(a) prescribing standards of habitation as set out in Appendix X, Division (i), to be enforced
by local government authorities and prescribing the means of such enforcement ; and
(b) empowering the State Housing Authority to :
(i) supervise the actions of local government authorities with respect to having
dwellings not complying with the standards of habitation in (a) declared undesirable
for human habitation or unfit for human habitation;
(ii) in default by a local government authority take the prescribed action itself;
(iii) classify and fix the rental for sub-standard houses, including parts of houses and
furnished houses until they comply with the standards of habitation in (a) ; and
(iv) make a advance to an owner of a sub-standard house who would not be able
without suffering undue hardship to provide the money necessary to make such
house comply with the standards of habitation in (a), and such an advance with
interest to be a first charge on the land on which the house is situate, (paragraph 630)
60. The regulations (Procedure and Forms) under Slum Reclamation and Housing Act of
March, 1940, of the Housing Commission, Victoria, could be used as a basis to form that section of
the administration which would be necessary to give effect to the standards of habitation set out in
Appendix X, Division (i) ; this would apply to serving notices for demolition or requiring occupier
to vacate a house, closing a street, etc. (paragraph 631)
61. A Commonwealth Uniform Building Code should be framed. (paragraph 632)
62 For the transition period (where not covered by standards set out in Appendix X,
Division Vii) ), the regulations which are operating at present in respective States, and which are
approved of by the State Housing Authority and agreed to by the Commonwealth Housing Authority,
should be used until they are superseded by a Commonwealth Uniform Building Code, (paragraph 633)
63. The Commonwealth Uniform Building Code be framed by a part-time permanent standing
committee of technical experts, including representation from each State, appointed by the
Commonwealth Housing Authority. (paragraph 636)
64. Modular standardisation of components be investigated by the Experimental Building
Station and the Standards Association of Australia for the following reasons to secure :
(a) simplification of design;
( b ) cost reduction through limiting variety of sizes and, therefore, variety of plant ; and
(c) interchangeability of components irrespective of manufacturer. (paragraph 668)
65. As a means of assisting standardisation of domestic equipment in government-financed
housing, the number of different styles thereof should be reduced to the number necessary to
adaptation to the needs of particular areas and particular types of dwellings. (paragraph 669)
66. The Experimental Building Station should examine the standard of construction of any
prefabricated dwellings or components referred to it by the manufacturer, and if the standard P r °ves
satisfactory a certificate of approval shall be issued. (paragraph 676)
67. For government-financed home-purchase schemes no difference should be made in
the period of purchase for any class of permanent construction. (paragraph 690)
68. Technical criteria should be developed by the Commonwealth Housing Authority in
conjunction with the Experimental Building Station in the following fields .
strength and stability;
moisture penetration and condensation;
thermal insulation;
sound insulation;
fire hazard;
maintenance and durability ; and
vermin infestation. (Paragraph 693)
69. With respect to hostels :
(I) in planning housing estates in towns, sites should be provided for hostels for the following
persons :
(i) senior school children;
(ii) young people, including students;
(iii) people of mature age, including single persons liable to transfer, and workers
employed at some distance from their homes;


(2) the erection of these hostels should proceed when the need for them has been
established and the availability of resources permits;
(3) the hostels should be erected, furnished and equipped by the State Housing Authority ;
and
(4) the State Housing Authority should have power to manage these hostels or lease them
to a local government authority or other approved body or person. (paragraph 725)
70. With respect to aged and infirm persons :
(o) special provision should be made by the State Housing Authority in the government-
financed housing programme for accommodation for each class of such persons, and
this should take the following form :
(1) for those who desire to live in independent units, special accommodation in the
form of dwellings scattered through the community in ground floor flats, or
attached dwelling units, and letting them, if necessary, with a rental rebate;
(2) for those who prefer to live in groups, by accommodation (suitably furnished
where necessary), grouped either as separate dwellings with central common
rooms or as small dwelling units with central common rooms and central service ;
arrange the authority to manage same or arrange to lease such groups of buildings
to a government department, local government authority, or other approved
organisation ; and
(b) Consideration should be given by the Commonwealth and State Community Facilities
Committees to the provision of suitable recreational facilities for such persons.
(paragraph 731)
71. Where aborigines can take their place in the community and desire to be housed in
towns, the standard of housing should be comparable to that already laid down as a reasonable
standard. (paragraph 735)
72. For new permanent dwellings the standards laid down for government-sponsored urban
housing in Appendix X, Division (ii), should apply also to government-sponsored rural housing,
with certain qualifications, such as :
(1) the provision of piped water, electricity and/or gas will depend on the existence of
a public supply in the area in question ; and
(2) the allowable percentage for additional floor area will be 4 per cent, greater than for
urban dwellings. This will allow for additional verandahs, larger living space and
store rooms. (paragraph 769)
73. State Governments should be asked to enact legislation requiring existing rural dwellings
to be brought up to the standards of habitation laid down in Appendix X, Division (i), within a
prescribed period, say, twelve months ; extension of time up to five years may be granted upon
application for carrying out this provision. (paragraph 770)
74. State Governments should be asked to enact legislation to require suitable accommodation
to be provided for all single farm workers where housed on rural properties and to require existing
housing provided for married farm workers to be of at least the standard of habitation laid down in
Appendix X, Division (i). (paragraph 771)
75. The Commonwealth Housing Authority should initiate investigation into suitable minimum
standards of accommodation for seasonal workers and all temporary rural employees, (paragraph 772)
76. In the case of housing on rural properties, finance should be made available on reasonable
terms and conditions through a government agency which has also power to lend on the whole
property. (paragraph 775)
77. The Experimental Building Station should investigate the possibilities of demountable
and prefabricated houses, and other methods of reducing the cost of housing in rural areas.
(paragraph 779)
78. The policy on clearance of slums is a matter for decision in each particular case between
the State Planning Authority, the State Housing Authority and the local government authority.
(paragraph 792)
79. Legislation be enacted in all States that no compensation be paid for houses declared unfit
for habitation, but ex gratia payments may be made in certain circumstances as set out in the Model
Housing Act, Part VIII (Appendix VI). (paragraph 796)
80. The special committee referred to in paragraphs 310 and 314 also report on compensation
for the resumption of built-up areas for purposes of re-planning, with particular regard to securing
a uniform basis of compensation which will disallow inflated values due to the housing shortage or to
unearned increment which has accrued to owners of the property. (paragraph 805)
81. In the post-war period the Commonwealth Government should recognise the clearance
of slums as partially a national responsibility and where slum clearance schemes are approved by the
Commonwealth Planning Authority, the Commonwealth Government should, in conjunction with
the State Governments and the local government authority or authorities concerned and/or benefited,
contribute to the loss sustained by such slum clearance on a basis to be determined by mutual
agreement in eachfparticular case. (paragraph 817)


82 In planning all new areas and in re-planning all built-up areas, land and holdings should
be provided for at least the minimum community facilities listed in paragraphs 831 and ® 34 > and .

86. A Commonwealth Community Facilities Committee should be set up under the
Commonwealth Planning Authority or, pending its establishment, under the Mlnlst Z°
Reconstruction. IP 8 P >
87. Local Community Facilities Committees should be set up as follows :
(1) if the local government authority is rating the community for the capital and/or running
costs of the community facilities, then such authority should have the primary responsi-
bility in sponsoring and administering the facilities, but the members of the community
must be represented on the local committee by persons additional to the members
of the local government authority ; but
(2) If the local government authority does not rate the community to raise the finance,
7 then the local government authority should be represented on the local committee for
the purpose of acting as a channel for finance and information, and providing sanity
and continuity in the work of the committee. (paragraph 843)
88 The capital cost of the land, buildings and initial standard equipment required for the
approved minimum standard of community facilities exclusive of shops, schools and religious facilities,
should be shared equally by the Commonwealth Government, the State Governments and the local
government authorities ; in special circumstances additional assistance may be granted by the
Commonwealth Government on the recommendation of the Commonwealth Community Fa £il't'es

model community centre in each State. (paragraph 850)
91. The use of electricity should be extended by the following means :
(i) all State Governments be urged to take the action necessary to increase the production
and distribution of electric energy at a distribution cost that will enable all dwelling
units, except in remote districts not within an electric supply area, to be supplied
with electricity at a price within the means of the people, and in sufficient bulk that
light and power consuming equipment can be freely used;
(ii) State Housing Authorities, when building houses in areas out of reach of electric supply

vacuum cleaners, refrigerators and radios;
(i'i) State Housing Authorities, in government-financed houses, should provide for a modern
standard of illumination in all rooms;
(iv) State Housing Authorities should require that all government-sponsored houses be
wired in a modern method including multi-phase wiring ; conduits, fuse boxes, main
distribution boards, recessed switches and other fittings should be built in during the
erection of the walls, thus saving cutting and chopping walls after erection;
(v) all supply authorities should carry cables underground in streets when reticulating
new housing projects;
(vi) all supply authorities should service their consumers’ installations and fittings, carrying
stocks of spare parts in order to save costs and time in making repairs and replacements ;
and
(vii) further investigations should be made into the standardisation of electrical apparatus
and equipment so as to reduce not only the cost of manufacture but also the cost of
servicing. (paragraph 876)

sewerage authorities concerned prior to planning any housing projects to ensure that
sewerage will be available to all houses or to make other arrangements for disposal of
the sewage by modern means;
(ii) action should be taken to ensure that all closely settled communities of 1,000 people
or over have some modern method of sewage disposal;
(iii) all septic tank installations should be constructed to a standard defined by the State
Housing Authority and be registered ; and
(iv) the Experimental Building Station be asked to investigate the effective treatment of
sullage water where sewerage systems are not installed. (paragraph 895)
94. Partial air conditioning or cooling be considered by State Housing Authorities in tropical
and sub-tropical districts for certain rooms in dwelling units and for community facility buildings,
and the matter of cooling dwelling units, either mechanically or otherwise, should be considered

* Recommendation 48 in the summary of recommendations (paragraph SO7 of the report)
was not agreed to by Mr. A V.Thompson


MINORITY RECOMMENDATION, by Mr. A. V. THOMPSON, M.H.A.
SUBSIDISED INTEREST RATE.
I recommend that subsidies for home purchase be made by loans by the Commonwealth to the
States at rates of interest and conditions that will enable the States to make loans to approved home
purchasers at a rate of interest payment not exceeding the rate of 3 per cent, per annum on the amount
owing by the borrower on the first day of each calendar month ; this rate to include costs of administration
and management, the advance or loan including interest to be repaid in equal monthly instalments during
a period not exceeding twenty-five years, such loan not to exceed the amount of one thousand pounds.
The difference between the cost of such money to the Commonwealth and the rate of interest at which
it is advanced to the States to be borne by the Commonwealth or jointly by the Commonwealth and
States in proportions as agreed upon by them.
The amount of subsidy payable under this method will vary according to the cost of money to the
Commonwealth ; if raised by loan the amount would represent the difference in the rate of interest
paid by the Commonwealth for the money raised and the rate of interest received from the State authority.
If the money loaned to the State authority was partly from revenue and partly from loan the amount of
subsidy would be proportionately reduced, perhaps eliminated altogether.
The maximum period of repayment is fixed at twenty-five years for two reasons :
(1) As a reasonable portion of a person’s life in which to complete the purchase, and
(2) To ensure an appreciable equity to the borrower in the early years of the purchasing period;
in a term longer than twenty-five years, particularly in a forty-year term of purchase, the annual reduction
of the amount of loan is so small that the percentage reduction in the amount of the weekly payments does
not adequately offset the increased amount of interest paid ; for instance, a loan of £l,OOO at 3 per cent,
interest is repaid in twenty-five years at a weekly instalment of 22/-, the same loan in a forty-years term
would require a weekly instalment of 16/Bd., a reduction of approximately 24 per cent. In the twenty-five
year term the full amount of £l,OOO would be repaid in that period, but in a forty-year term during the
first twenty-five years only £482 would be repaid, a reduction of loan payment of only approximately
48 per cent. ; thus a person commencing a purchase at thirty years of age would in the twenty-five year
term have completed the repayment of the £l,OOO loan at the age of fifty-five, but if in a forty-year term
would, at that age, be still owing £5lB of the £l,OOO borrowed and would not complete the repayment
until 70 years of age.
The amount of subsidy required to be paid on a loan of £l,OOO for a twenty-five year term at 3 per
cent, interest, payable by the purchaser, would, if the difference in cost was I per cent., be approximately
£lO for the first year, gradually reducing to nil at the end of the twenty-five years, the average amount
over the whole period being approximately £6 per annum. This amount of subsidy would be increased
or decreased according to any variation of I per cent, in the difference between the cost of the loan and
the rate of interest charged to the State Authority, where the purchaser makes additional payment to
that provided in the terms of the loan the total amount of subsidy would be proportionately reduced.
Taking the full amount of loan to each purchaser as £l,OOO and the difference in rate of interest
paid by the Commonwealth for the money and the rate of interest they receive from the State Authority
as I per cent, per annum, the amount of subsidy for each 100,000 homes erected for home purchase would
be an average of approximately £600,000 per annum for the twenty-five year period.
A schedule of tables is attached as Appendix XIX.

Appendix III. Summary of Housing Legislation.
COMMONWEALTH.
WAR SERVICE HOMES ACT, 1918-41.
for hoI« War Service Homes Act, 1918-41, which was enacted on 25th December, 1918, made provision
A f n Ansr ? ' an m d ' erS f !,T 6 de P endants of Australian soldiers, and for certain other
Militarv* A f A ' a " * old ' er ls de L fined by the Act to be a person who was a member of the Navy or
Military Forces of Australia during the continuance of the war which commenced in the year 1914 and
who was on active service outside Australia or on a ship of war, or was a member of the Nursing Service
Air oK| f ° r SerV c' Ce ° UtSld ? Australia- It also provided for Australians who served in the Naval, Military,

THe Ct P ro , vided that the Commissioner appointed under the Act may acquire land, erect dwellings
thereon and sell them to eligible persons, the cost of the house not to exceed a stated amount, which
IS now IVbO. The Commissioner may also advance to an eligible person to enable him—
(a) to erect a dwelling house on land owned by him ;
(b) to purchase land and erect thereon a dwelling house ;
(c) to purchase a dwelling house together with the land on which it is erected ;
(d) to complete a partially erected dwelling house owned by him ;
(e) to enlarge a dwelling house owned by him ; or
(f) to discharge any mortgage, charge, or encumbrance already existing on his holding.
The maximum advance not to exceed a stated amount, which is at present £950, or 90 per cent, of the
total value of the security ; the repayment of the advance, together with interest, which was not to
exceed 5 per cent, (at present 4 per cent.) to be made in equal instalments over a period not exceeding
fifty years in the case of a widow or widowed mother of an Australian soldier, or forty-five years in other
cases. Provision is made in the case of hardship for the Commissioner to extend as he thinks fit the time
for making any payment required.
In 1941 the Act was amended, extending the definition of an eligible person to the present war
and provided for the inclusion of members of the Air Force and Mercantile Marine.
COMMONWEALTH HOUSING ACT, 1927-28.
The Commonwealth Housing Act, 1927-28, empowered the Commonwealth Savings Bank, operating
under the Commonwealth Bank Act, 1911-27, to invest any moneys held by it in advancing money for
the purchase or erection of dwelling houses and for the discharge of mortgages on dwelling houses, and
to make such advances to a prescribed Commonwealth, Territorial, State or Municipal Authority, which
administers a scheme for providing or assisting in providing dwelling houses.
Advances are made on terms and conditions as are agreed upon with the Authority, provided such
Authority’s housing scheme makes provision for—
(i) maximum advance of £1,600, but not exceeding 90 per cent, of the valuation of the property
in respect of which the advance is made ;
(ii) income of the applicant does not exceed £l2 per week ;
(iii) no advance to be made to any person whose wife or husband has already received an advance ;
(iv) no advance to be made unless the applicant satisfies the Authority that he is residing or
will reside in the dwelling house.
The Commonwealth Housing Act, 1927-28, empowered the Treasurer, under the Commonwealth
Inscribed Stock Act, 1911-18, to borrow moneys in order to grant to the Commonwealth Savings Bank
a sum that, with other funds available to the Savings Bank, would amount to £20,000,000 for the purposes
of the Act.
Advances have been made to the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales (now Rural Bank),
State Bank of South Australia, Workers’ Homes Board of Western Australia and the Commissioner for
Housing, Australian Capital Territory. The advances were made on terms providing for repayments
equal to those made to the Authority by the borrowers, the whole advance to be repaid within a fixed
period, which was twenty-five years in the case of the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales
and thirty-five years in the case of the other authorities.

NEW SOUTH WALES.
BUILDING LEGISLATION AND HEALTH ACTS.
The first Act relating to the regulation of building in New South Wales was the Sydney Building
Sydney Corporation Act, 1932-42.
Close on the heels of the Sydney Building Act. 1837. followed the Police Act of 1838, which provided,
inter alia, for a measure of regulation of building in towns other than the town of Sydney. These provisions
were administered by the Government through the magistrates.
In 1858 the first Municipalities Act was passed, and thirty-five municipalities were incorporated
during the nine years the Act was in force. The Municipalities Act of 1867 repealed that Act and, inter
alia transferred to the thirty-five Municipal (Borough) Councils already constituted and such others as
might be constituted under the Act the powers of the magistrates relating to building regulation under
the Police Act of 1838.
The Municipalities Act of 1897 consolidated the Act of 1867, and a number of amending Acts which
had been passed in the meantime.
In 1905 and 1906 the whole of the State, with the exception of certain areas in the Western Division
was incorporated as municipalities or shires under the Local Government Acts of the period, consolidated
in the Local Government Act, 1906, and the powers of the magistrate relating to building regulation under
the Police Offences Act, 1901, which repealed and consolidated the Police Act of 1838 and amending Acts,
were made applicable to the municipal and shire councils, and the powers of these councils in respect
of building regulation were extended. The Local Government Act 1906, was repealed by the Local
Government Act, 1919, which, with Acts subsequently amending it, further considerably extended the
powers of councils in relation to building regulation as now developed.
Building is regulated, therefore, in the City of Sydney, under the Sydney Corporation Act, 1932-
1942 and, in the Municipalities and Shires, under the Local Government Act, 1919. The detailed
machinery is provided for in by-laws from time to time made by the City Council and approved by the
Governor-in-Counci I under the Sydney Corporation Act'and in Ordinances made by the Governor-in-
Council under the Local Government Act, both at the time they are approved or made being subject to
veto by either House of Parliament.
These Dy-law and ordinance-making provisions are elastic and enable procedure, practice and
standards to be readily kept up to date in conformity with developments in technique and materials and
so on, without the need for constant amending legislation.
When making its building by-laws the Municipal Council of Sydney is required to obtain from
the Building Advisory Committee constituted under the Act a report and recommendation on the subject
of the by-laws. This Committee, which holds office for three-yearly periods, is a most comprehensive
one, including the City Building Surveyor, City Health Officer, Chief Officer of Fire Brigades, an Officer
of the Department of Labour and Industry, and an Officer nominated by the Minister administering the
Theatres and Public Halls Act, and nominees of the Water Board, Fire and Accident Underwriters’
Association, Institute of Architects, Board of Architects, Institution of Engineers, Master Builders
Association, Board of Health, and the City Council. This Committee has power, of its own motion,
amongst other things to make recommendations to the City Council for the making or amendment of
building by-laws and statutes.

GOVERNMENT BODIES.
• The , fil 7 J t the Housing Acts passed in this State was the Housing Act of 1912 under which was
consmuted a Housing Board. This Board was empowered to acquire land, carry out construction thereon
which o the Bo r ard et c^H Pro r t !f S - Powers were incorporated in this Act under*
which the Board could make advances of money to assist people to erect or acquire homes.
S..h.,rh S / a °il^- after the P assa B e , of the original Act the Board began the construction of Dacey Garden
Suburb (a letting project), which was completed in 1918. It comprises 315 homes, six residential shops
and community buildings such as a public hall and picture theatre, police station, baby clinic, public school,
etc. This project formed the Board s only major rental venture.
«- rl h u IS ? 0a j rd u alS n acc l ui . reci ,and in various suburban and country centres which it subdivided. On
part of this land the Board itself erected and sold 376 cottages under extended terms of payment. The
remainder was sold under a condition that the purchasers within a specified period erected dwellings
hereon. To assist in this direction, advances were made to the purchasers. The administration of these
accounts was later transferred to the Rural Bank of New South Wales.
For a period the Board took over the management of the Observatory Hill area, Sydney where
a large area had been resumed for harbour improvements, and several blocks of flats to house waterside
workers had been erected.
Under an amendment passed in 1924 to this Act, the Minister became the corporation under it
and the Housing Board ceased to function. The administration and management of the Dacey Garden
Suburb, ana of Crown lands appropriated by the Board and not sold, were delegated initially to the Public
Trustee and later to the Resumed Properties Department. The administration on behalf of the State
ot all other land and securities passed to the Rural Bank of New South Wales.
Further activities under this Act were not undertaken until 1941, when three (3) projects,
comprising 215 dwellings to house munition workers, were commenced at several country centres.
* were completed after the constitution of the Housing Commission of New South Wales
in 1942. Because of national circumstances the construction of further permanent houses ceased, but so
as to provide accommodation for war workers the Commission undertook on behalf of the Commonwealth
the construction of a large number of temporary housing projects and hostels in various centres. Since
the beginning of 1944 the Commission has recommenced the construction of permanent housing and is
now engaged upon an extensive programme of such works.
Between 1912 and 1942, when the Housing Commission was created, the following agencies were
established : °
(1) An Advances for Homes Department was created in the Government Savings Bank of
New South Wales in 1913 to provide finance for home building and for home purchase.
The newly-created Rural Bank took over the functions of that Department by amendments
to the Government Savings Bank Act of 1931-32. An Act of 1934 created three further
agencies—the Government Housing Agency, the Home Building Scheme Agency, and the
Building Relief Agency. A fourth, the Soldiers’ Families Housing Agency was created in
1941, to make special provision for members of the Forces and their dependants. By
operation of the Housing Act, 1941, the power to make advances under these agencies was
withdrawn from the Rural Bank on 31st October, 1942.
(2) The Homes for Unemployed Trust was created under the Housing of the Unemployed Act,
1934, and its purpose was to assist in the housing of the unemployed. To do this the Trust
either built homes on land which it acquired and sold them, or provided materials from
which small dwelling units could be erected on land in which the assisted party had some
interest. Altogether the Trust built 833 home units and provided materials in 1,946 cases.
The weekly payments required were designed to be within the ability of the assisted parties
to pay and, almost without exception, did not exceed 8/- per week, and in many instances
were much lower. In all of these cases interest at 2 per cent, per annum only was charged.
Of the 833 homes erected, ninety-three are operated on a tenancy basis because
of sales not proceeding or through reversions.


m Under the Housing Improvement Act, 1936, an attempt was made to interest municipal
councils in slum clearance and re-housing by the creation of a Housing Improvement Board.
It was one of the Board’s functions to prepare schemes for which councils would be
responsible on the basis that councils would not suffer any financial loss by reason of the
operation of any adopted scheme. Councils remained apathetic, and accordingly the
Government authorised the Board to proceed with the Erskineville Housing Estate as a
demonstration project in the Municipality of Erskineville. The scheme entailed the
construction of fifty-six flats and ancillary works, the lay-out of a park and the construction
of a sports ground. The flats were completed in 1938 and the remainder of the schenne
in 1939. In addition to these works, the Kindergarten Union, in conjunction with the
Commonwealth Government and the Board, established the Lady Gowrie Child Centre on
the Estate. The scheme has proved quite successful.
The Act also provided for the Board to :
(a) Investigate housing conditions generally.
(b) Submit to the Governor in the light of these investigations a report as to the further laws
which should be enacted in New South Wales in relation to the elimination of unsatisfactory
housing conditions, the provision of housing accommodation and town and regional
planning, the report to deal specifically with the following aspects :
(i) The most economic method to be adopted to achieve slum clearance, etc.
(ii) The method of acquiring land for housing purposes.
(iii) Finance.
(iv) Details of control, management, maintenance, repair, sale, letting and other problems
associated with housing.
The Board submitted its report in November, 1937, accompanied by a draft bill to give effect to
its recommendations.
The Housing Act, 1941, under which the Housing Commission of New South Wales was constituted,
served to consolidate under one authority the various State housing bodies which had been functioning
to date, and provide additional powers to the Commission. These included the provision of finance for
the same purposes as those for which the Rural Bank could make advances under its Building Relief and
Soldiers’ Families Housing Agencies ; authority to borrow on its own securities and to manufacture,
produce or purchase and supply building materials, fittings or appliances to any person or body of persons
corporate or unincorporate.
Concentration upon the building of hostels and temporary housing for war workers on behalf of
the Commonwealth Government, together with war-time restrictions under the National Security
Regulations and the limited manpower and materials available, have up to the present precluded the
Commission from exercising its powers to any great extent.
So far as local government bodies are concerned, the Sydney Municipal Council is the only one
which interested itself to any extent in housing. In the period 1914-1927 it embarked upon four housing
schemes, totalling 169 flats located at Chippendale, Woolloomooloo, Pyrmont and Camperdown. In
view of the losses involved under these schemes, no further projects have been carried out by the Council.
QUASI-GOVERNMENT BODIES.
The Government Savings Bank Act, 1913, created an Advances for Homes Department in the
Government Savings Bank of New South Wales to provide finance for home building and purchase.
By the Government Savings Bank (Housing Amendment) Act, 1928, three divisions were created
in this Department :
(i) The limit of advances specified as £750 by the 1913 Act was increased to £1,200.
(ii) The Bank could build and make advances up to 90 per cent, of the cost of £1,200.
(iii) The Bank could obtain funds from the Housing Fund created by the Commonwealth Housing
Act, 1927-1928, to make advances to 90 per cent, of valuation—operations continued for
just over a year ; 1,077 loans being issued.
The Rural Bank.
(a) Advances for Homes Department.
The Rural Bank took over the housing functions of the Savings Bank of New South Wales in 1932,
and now has power to erect, enlarge, or purchase a dwelling or to discharge a mortgage within the limits
prescribed by the Government Savings Bank legislation. Advances are normally up to 75 per cent, of
valuation.
In 1940 a scheme was adopted to assist persons in the lower wage groups by making available from
the funds of the bank loans up to 90 per cent, of valuation of land and dwelling and providing a further
5 per cent, from Government moneys. Eight hundred and eighty-nine loans of approximately £7OO
were made.


(b) Government Agency Department.
This Department was created by the Rural Bank (Agency) Act of 1934 to administer Government
funds and policies. Between 1934 and 1943, four agencies were created :
(i) The Government Housing Agency administered properties taken over from the Housing
Board in 1924, and funds made available by the State Government in 1933 for repairs on
these homes. r
(ii) The Homes Building Scheme Agency enabled the Bank to supplement 75 per cent, loans
made in the normal way through the Advances for Homes Department from State
Government funds made available for that purpose. This scheme operated 1934-36, 1940-42.
(iii) The Building Relief Agency in 1934 superseded the Building Relief Committee created
in 1933 to make advances for repairs and so to provide employment in the building industry
created by the depression. 1
(iv*) The Soldiers Families Housing Agency made advances for housing to members of the services
and their wives or widows.
All four agencies operated with funds provided by the State Government. The Housing Commission of
New South Wales in 1942 took over the administration of all future business of these agencies.
Building Societies.
In 1847 a law modelled on the English legislation was enacted in New South Wales to provide for
the establishment of building societies.
The first known terminating society was founded in 1848, and first permanent society in 1850.
Seventeen societies were registered in 1864, all but two of them terminating. After 1857, when a society
was founded in Albury, they began to appear in the country. Between 1865-80, when the movement
progressed rapidly, seventy-seven new societies were registered. At least fifty of them were in country
towns.
Permanent building societies became very popular after 1870, six of the seven still existent were
formed between 1870-80. Twenty-five of fifty societies registered between 1870-90 were permanent.
The rapid growth of building societies up to 1890 coincided with a period of economic expansion
and prosperity. A number of companies sprang up to exploit the land boom, these land and building
societies being registered under the Companies Act, 1874. Unfortunately, however, their names,
phraseology, and methods confused them in the public mind with building societies which, as a result,
suffered simultaneously by the loss of public confidence in the depression which set in in 1891.
The confusion of identity was enhanced by the fact that some land companies made advances for
the erection of houses on allotments sold by them. Others even claimed that their companies represented
an improvement on the benefit building society.
The debacle began in August, 1891, with the failure of a loan and guarantee company. In six months,
twenty institutions suspended payment due to the fact that land sold less readily, the price fell, and
purchasers failed to pay instalments. Some were solvent, but could not meet the demands of their
depositors. Such institutions had accepted large deposits from the public at high interest rates to finance
their operations and had invested them in land. Unable to repay in cash, they were forced to come to
an agreement with their shareholders for a gradual adjustment. Included in these were three permanent
building societies, two of which had been dealing in land.
Permanent societies suffered most heavily from the competition of the land companies and the
economic depression. At least five disappeared during the 1880’s and seven during the IB9o’s, while
two more registered as companies. Thereafter they evidenced a gradual decline. Those in active
existence dwindled from twenty-one in 1895 to seven in 1923. Not one has been founded since 1888
that has lasted.
In any case, they offered little advantage for persons of small means on account of high interest
rates, short terms for loans, heavy repayments, and the need for a considerable deposit.
During the IB9o’s all the terminating societies survived, but their subsequent development was
seriously affected. The operations of those active declined. During 1892-1901 only sixteen new societies
were established. The public showed a great reluctance to invest in building, which was only carried on
in cases of necessity and for exceptional profit. The building society movement was at its lowest ebb.
This period, however, gave impetus to a new development—the Starr-Bowkett Society, which
rapidly increased in popularity after 1893. There were sixteen Starr-Bowkett Societies in existence
in 1892, mainly in groups in Sydney, Bathurst, Dubbo and Orange. The first registered under the name
was in 1868. In the next thirty years 174 were established. In 1923 there were only eight terminating
societies not of this type.
The original type of “ building and investment ” society which was common in the initial period,
and which was modelled on a type popular in England, had commenced to lose popularity as early as 1870.
After 1893 very few were registered.
The Act of 1847 did no more than give building societies a legal status, and require the submission
of their rules for examination. Amended slightly, it was incorporated in the Consolidated Friendly
Societies Act, 1873. There was no effective provision for official supervision or control under this Act
or under the Act of 1902—which took building societies once again out of the Friendly Societies Act.
It was not till the Act of 1923 that an effective official control over building societies was instituted.


The Act of 1923, now called the Co-operation Act, was designed not only to give an effective degree
of official oversight but also to encourage their formation. A Registrar was appointed to that end and,
by the Housing Improvement Act, 1936-37, a Co-operative Building Advisory Committee was established.
The latter Act provided for Government guarantee to be extended to building societies on the
recommendation of the Advisory Committee. Under this provision the Government guarantees
repayment by building societies of moneys borrowed from banks, insurance offices, friendly societies
and from other approved bodies. Another provision enables the Government to indemnify the building
society against loss on loans made by it in excess of 80 per cent, and up to 90 per cent of the member s
security. In calculating this ratio the member’s paid-up capital in the society is deducted from the
valuation of the security. The maximum loan is £l,OOO (plus paid-up capital to £110). The member
must not have other house property in these cases and he must undertake to live in the home he thereby
acquires.
The Committee has, since its inception, encouraged the formation of a chosen type of terminating
building society. The encouragement has given them great impetus. Since 1936 the numbers have
increased from ten to 197. The total number of societies registered at 30th June, 1939, was 328, including
seven permanent building societies. Two hundred and eighty-two societies were actually active.
VICTORIA.
BUILDING LEGISLATION.
The first Act for the regulation of building was passed in 1845, to apply to the City of Melbourne.
Its provisions could be extended to apply to other municipalities by the enactment of by-laws. The
Local Government Act, 1890, contained provisions regarding the municipal regulations of buildings
(part sof the 13th schedule). As these were found to be inadequate, the Local Government Act, 1891,
enabled municipalities to make their own by-laws to regulate and restrain the erection and construction
of buildings. The Local Government Acts of 1903 and 1915 added to their powers to make by-laws in
respect of demolition, allotment, size, etc. As the exercise of their powers was not a statutory duty,
local government bodies were slow to take action, particularly in the country areas.
A conference of experts convened by the Commission of Public Works in 1915 submitted a draft
code of building by-laws which could be mandatory on the councils to overcome deficiencies in the
legislation. Witness to the fact that neither uniformity nor a sufficient standard had been achieved up
to 1941 was the inquiry of the Building Regulations Commission, 1941-42, which presented a second
draft code of provisions based on existing by-laws and Acts involving building.
Local government bodies also had power to ensure some standard of habitability of houses under
the Health Act, 1928. These powers were later incorporated in the Slum Reclamation Housing Act,
1938. The first public Health Statute was passed in 1865. An amending statute in 1883 contained powers
to declare houses unfit for occupation and to take action against them as well as to relieve overcrowding.
Powers were added in the 1889 Act, and consolidated in the 1890 Act. They remained substantially
unchanged until they were expanded in 1920 and 1928. The Royal Commission in 1917 had remarked
on their inadequacy and the difficulties involved in taking proceedings. The Housing Board in 1937
declared their administration of powers to deal with sub-standard housing, rather than the powers
themselves, to be defective. Amendments in 1938 and the new draft building regulations will remove
powers of this kind from the scope of the Health Act.
GOVERNMENT BODIES.
Under the Workers’ Dwellings Act, 1914, and the Local Government Act, 1915, councils were
empowered to borrow to acquire land to build for leasing to persons receiving an income of £2OO per
annum or less. Nowhere did councils use their power owing to the reluctance of ratepayers to accept
the possibility of loss.
A Royal Commission, after thorough investigation of the problem of housing and its control during
the years 1915-18, recommended the need for purchase of land and provision of dwellings by the State.
The State did not undertake any responsibility until the problem had become so aggravated that the
Government initiated inquiries in 1935, leading to the appointment of the Housing Investigation and
Slum Abolition Board in 1936. As the outcome of its report, a Housing Act was passed in 1937 to provide
for a Commission of four members, which was appointed on Ist March, 1938. At first it had no power
to implement housing schemes—its task being to investigate and report upon methods by which housing
conditions in Victoria could be improved and to recommend further legislation which was passed in the
same year. It included adequate powers for housing and slum clearance, and powers over the habitability
of houses previously contained to a limited_degree in the Health Act. Building began in 1939, and over
1,000 houses were completed within four"~years in various estates. These houses are rented only to
people of small means, with rebates where T the f family income per week.
Prior to this, the only State and Municipal housing schemes were those at Yallourn, built by the
State Electricity Commission for its employees ; the Housing Reclamation Scheme of the South Melbourne
Council ; and Fishermen’s Bend, Port Melbourne, where forty-four houses were built by the Victorian
Government as an experiment under the Public Works Loan Application Act, 1935 ; these houses were
transferred to the Commission after its inception.


NON-GOVERNMENT BODIES.
(a) Store Savings Bank.
Fonder Department of the State Savings Bank was established by Act of Parliament in
1896 to make advances on farm properties. Loans are granted up to £1,500, or 75 per cent, of the Bank’s
valuation for the purchase of a house on freehold land. In 1910 the system was extended to urban
dwellings and shop securities. The Bank did not erect or supervise the erection of building until after
the inception of the Housing Advances Section of the Act (Div. 4, Part 3) in 1921. Dwelling houses
acquired or built by the Bank could then be bought without deposit, but the borrower must have an
income of less than £4OO a year ; over 12,000 were erected under this scheme. It has built 278 houses
in a scheme at Garden City, Port Melbourne, as well as on land owned by applicants. Between 1922-32,
3,748 War Service homes and, since 1941, sixty-eight munition workers’ homes, were built by agreement
with the Commonwealth Government.
(b) Building Societies.
The first known building society in Australia was one in the Port Phillip district formed before
1846. The gold rushes, 1852-55, created great prosperity. A number of societies were formed, but the
subscriptions for purchase of land and property were too high for many subscribers to keep up payments.
An amendment to the Friendly Societies Act, 1850, in 1855 gave some protection to such societies by the
appointment of a Registrar. By 1874, when the Building Societies’ Act made it compulsory for them
to register, there were fifty-eight in existence. The number of societies active fell slightly till the 1880’s,
when a decade of high wages and prosperity with the facilities afforded by the Friendly Societies’ Act!
and the limited field of investment for savings encouraged the formation of building societies. The
rapid increase in population in Melbourne caused a keen demand for housing and particularly for land.
The Act of 1874 permitted registered societies to deal in freehold land and property if sanctioned
by a resolution of members. Most societies attracted by the large profits to be made dealt in land. By
expanding their business to the receipt of deposits—even as far afield as Great Britain—they were able
to plunge into land speculation along with a number of land companies which sprang up at the time.
The majority of building societies— seventy in number in 1890—departed entirely from their
original functions and became mortgage companies. Their operations were conducted with little regard
for the type of security or any correspondence between the maturity of deposits or loans. The sudden
crash caught them unprepared.
The failure of the Premier Permanent Building Association, one of the most prominent, at the
end of 1889 was the first important financial disaster. Alarm caused a steady withdrawal of deposits from
all building societies. During 1891-92 seven suspended payments. Most engaged to repay their depositors
at extended terms. Only three or four were liquidated.
During the IB9o’s they did not recover as readily as the banks. The real property market was
stagnant. Investors were shy. Building did not begin to revive till 1896. Societies not obliged to
reconstruct could get no new business. The number functioning had fallen to thirty-six in 1898.
Since the complete collapse of the land boom in 1893, the business of the societies has never been
on the same scale. There has been no development of terminating or Starr-Bowkett societies like that
of New South Wales. Of the 160 societies registered in Victoria up to 1939, only twenty-two were
actually operating. Twenty of these were permanent.
QUEENSLAND.
GOVERNMENT BODIES.
The following is a summary of the legislation enacted in Queensland in connection with State
Housing, which is administered by the State Advances Corporation.
Workers' Dwellings.
In 1909 the Workers’ Dwelling Act was passed to enable the Government to assist persons in
receipt of small incomes to provide homes for themselves. Operation under the Act did not commence
until January, 1910. The Act provided that any person who was the owner of a suitable residential site,
who was not the owner of a dwelling house within Queensland or elsewhere and who at the time of
making his application was not in receipt of an income of more than £2OO per annum, could apply for an
advance to enable him to erect a dwelling-house on his land as a home for himself and his family.
A summary of the dates and of the chief features of amendments is as follows :

Under this scheme up to 30th June, 1943, £8,886,198 has been advanced in respect of 20,011
dwellings erected, and advances in respect of 11,498 have been repaid in full.


Discharged Soldiers' Dwellings.
Prior to the inauguration of the Commonwealth War Service Homes Commission in 19'19 .loans
were granted to discharged soldiers or r e«°nTw dwellings! orw'purchase dwellings already
offered. Workers’ Homes.
In 1919 Parliament passed the Workers' Homes Act with a view to enabling those persons to
secure a home with as small a cash outlay as possible, who, owing to their fi nanc. a I circ u m s ta n c £ s. are
unable to contribute the deposit necessary for obtaining an advance for a worker s dwelling.
Owing, however, principally to the high cost of building at that time, no action was taken to put
the measure into operation.
Before the Act was amended in October, 1922, it was provided that Model Suburbs would be
established and homes erected on Crown land set apart for the purpose. The Act, as amended also
enables applicants to choose the particular locality where they desire to reside and, also the particu
block of land in that locality and further, also, to choose the design of home to be erected.
Operations under the Workers’ Homes Act were commenced in February, 1923.
An applicant must not have a net income of more than £260 per annum after allowing for the usual
deductions under the Income Tax Acts ; must not be the owner of a dwelling-house in Queensland or
elsewhere ; and must undertake to use the home as a home for himself and his family.
The homes are erected by the Corporation and sold at cost price to applicants under a contract
of sale with a deposit of 5 per cent, of the Capital cost of the home. The balance of outstanding purchase
mnnlv to beTepaid within twenty-five years with interest at the rate of 5 per cent, per annum by
monthly instalments of rent, which include, in addition to an amount sufficient to repay interest and
outstanding purchase money, provision for fire insurance, repairs, repainting and general expenses, and
also rent o g f land. Maximum cost of homes is left to the admin,strat,on-at present ,t
is homes are b ui | t on perpetual leasehold, for which leasehold a nominal rent, calculated at
3 per cent, per annum on the capital value of the land, is paid to the Corporation.
The purchaser of a home is required to insure his life, unless exempted, wholly or partially, for
an amount sufficient to pay in the event of his death, the full amount of the unpaid purchase money of
the home ; this provision ensures to the dependants a home free of debt or a reduced debt.

Building Revival Scheme.
On Ist August, 1932, in order to assist in the relief of unemployment, the Government inaugurated
the Building Revival’ Scheme, under the provisions of the “State Advances Corporation Buildings
Improvement Act of 1932,” under which any approved citizen of the State who is the registered proprietor
of the land on which a residence proposed to be improved is erected or who is acquiring a residence on
a system of rent-purchase under a contract of sale, provided the vendor thereof agrees to guarantee to
the Corporation the repayment of the advance, may without any income limitation or other restriction
whatsoever obtain a loan for any of the following purposes, namely :
(a) External and internal painting;
(b) General repairs to preserve residence;
(c) Alterations, additions, and other improvements in respect of residences (externally and
internally).
Loans are up to £3OO in respect of residences and £5OO for buildings used as Schools of Arts, halls, or for
agricultural and horticultural society purposes, etc.
.Advances are for a period of not exceeding ten years with interest at 4 per cent.
Advances totalling £175,286 were made to 1,552 borrowers under this scheme to 30th June, 1943.


State Housing Relief.

by the funding of arrears and the extension of terms of mortgages and all contracts of sale by ten years.
BUILDING LEGISLATION AND HEALTH ACTS.
The Brisbane City Council makes Ordinances under “The City of Brisbane Acts 1924 to 1943 ”
governing the area of the City (385 square miles). The Council was constituted in 1925 New Ordinances
are in draft to provide the City with a more adequate building code.
Local Authorities, other than the Brisbane City Council make* hv-lswc i m j ol . <« tl i ■
Government Acts, 1936 to 1943,” governing their particular areas. The provisions of such by-laws vary
considerably dependent on the requirements of the particular area. The whole area of the State is
Local Government. The Act distributing Local Government over the whole State was made in 1878
fn d |8 C 78 nSO 't d w^ d r" T Ac j Was £ in 1936 ' The or 'g' nal by-law making power was given
in 1878. It was considerably widened in the 1936 Act. 6 K s "

to ensure proper sanitation, drainage, etc. These provisions were first enacted in the Health Law in 1900.
BUILDING SOCIETIES.
Ifl cq !_hr ee building SoC i eties existed in Queensland before its separation from New South Wales in
1 859 - The first permanent society was founded in 1874. Building societies did not increase greatly In
number up to the Friendly Societies Act, 1876, which first required their registration. Sixteen 2 societies

sorieH« fl„ H hlC . h are Permanent, three are terminating, and four are Starr-Bowkett. Building
societies have declined since the depression of the IB9o’s. S
The 1880's formed a period of prosperity in Queensland, due partly to the gold discoveries and the
expansion of Brisbane. As in Victoria and New South Wales, building societies sprang up to meet the
phenomenal demand for land ; unable to get capital from the banks for their advances, they competed
thev r h f M f ° r the de P oslts of the public. The Government passed an Act in 1886 limiting the sums which
they could receive as deposits to prevent this competition from becoming serious. The Act was ineffective
and to traffir V in e ianH b >' < . re S lst ® r ' n ? as P ub lic companies in order to carry on a pseudo-banking business
and to traffic in land. Several building societies were included in their number. The collapse of the
land boom at the beginning of the 1890’s had the same consequences as in Victoria and New South Wales.
Building societies have not experienced the same popularity since.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
CONTROL OF BUILDING.
io4i T k h \ firSt Act to give , genera | control of building operations was the Municipal Corporations Act,
1861, which gave municipal councils control over the erection of buildings within their municipalities.
This legislation was superseded by the Building Act, 1881. This was the first legislation to provide
specifically for the general control of building construction and was modelled upon the Metropolitan
Building Act, 1855, which controlled building in London. K
tnth . ™ S A< i t Q . v ! as in tur " superseded by the Building Act, 1923. Extensive amendments were made
to this Act in 1940 as a result of recommendations contained in the first Report of the Building Act Inquiry
Committee. The Building Act, 1923-40, provides a complete building code and applies to all the urban
areas of South Australia. Section 98a of the Act provides for the constitution of a standing expert
committee whose duty it is to recommend from time to time any amendments to the building regulations
made necessary by changes of building practice, etc. 6
a - ,o F ° r :, Ural areas , to which the Building Act does not apply, provision is made in the Local Government
Act, iyj4-41, to regulate certain matters relating to building construction.
CONTROL OF INSANITARY, ETC., BUILDINGS.
Under the Building Act, 1923-1940, councils have power to bring about the demolition or repair
of dangerous or neglected structures. Under the Health Act, 1935-43, local boards of health have power
to secure the demolition or repair of insanitary buildings. The principal law dealing with this latter
topic is now contained in the Housing Improvement Act, 1940-1943, which was enacted as the result
o recommendations made in the second and third reports of the Building Act Inquiry Committee. Under
this Act, local boards of health have the duty of bringing about the demolition or repair of dwelling-houses
which are unfit or undesirable for human habitation. The South Australian Housing Trust has the duty
of general supervision of local boards of health, has power to bring about clearance of slum areas, has
power to fix rentals of sub-standard houses and has the duty of providing housing for persons dispossessed
trom demolished sub-standard houses.


PROVISION OF STATE HOUSING FOR LETTING.
Prior to 1936, legislation did not provide for people on low incomes who could only afford to rent
homes and not to buy. The South Australian Housing Trust Act, 1936-1942, was passed to create a body
for that purpose. Houses were to be built under two schemes, Groups A and B, financed from separate
funds Group A was to consist of houses built with money lent to the Trust ; Group B with money
from grants or bequests. Since none of the latter have been made, only Group A has functioned.
The original stipulation that houses should cost no more than £450 was amended in 1937 to £5OO,
or 820 times the daily living wage at the time of the contract ; whichever was less. Thejlimit to the
average cost of all houses was again amended in 1942 to £550 in the metropolitan area, £650 outside the
metropolitan area.
The Trust began building operations as soon as it was established and has erected over 1,900 houses,
which are let at low rentals.
In addition to its powers under the South Australian Housing Trust Act, 1936-1942, the Trust has
power under the Housing Improvement Act, 1940-1943, to provide houses for letting to persons of
limited means and has erected some houses under this Act which at present are let either to persons
with very large families or to widows of members of the armed forces.
PROVISION FOR STATE ASSISTANCE FOR HOUSES PURCHASED
THROUGH GOVERNMENT INSTRUMENTALITIES.
(I) Advances for Homes Act, 1928-1935.
The first Advances for Homes Act was passed in 1910. This Act made State funds available to the
State Bank of South Australia to make advances to persons to erect or purchase houses and land An
Amending Act of 1917 made special provision for returned soldiers and their dependants and during
the period 1920-1932 approximately half of the advances made were for soldiers, financed by the agreement
with the Commonwealth. In 1932, the duty of providing houses for soldiers was taken over by the
War Service Homes Commission.
The existing powers of the State Bank are contained in the Advances for Homes Act, 1928-1935.
The Bank may acquire land and erect dwelling-houses for sale to persons earning not more than £450 a
year, at an amount not exceeding £7OO and on a deposit of £25. Advances may be made on mortgage to
qualified persons of up to £7OO and up to six-sevenths of the value of the security for the purpose ot
constructing, purchasing, or enlarging a dwelling-house or discharging a mortgage thereon.
The State Bank has made advances in approximately 25,000 cases, of these approximately 14,000
have been for the purpose of buying new dwellings and approximately I 1,000 for the purchase of existing
dwellings, discharge of existing mortgages, etc. The amount of money which has been advanced is
approximately £13,500,000.
(2) South Australian Housing Trust Act, 1936, and Housing Improvement Act, 1940-1942.
Each of these Acts provides that the South Australian Housing Trust may sell any house to the
tenant thereof upon such terms and conditions as the Trust thinks fit. No houses have been sold by the
TrUSt The Advances to Settlers Act, 1930, the Agricultural Graduates Land Settlement Act, 1922-1938,
the Discharged Soldiers Settlement Act, 1934-1940, and the Irrigation Act, 1930-1941, provide, inter alia,
for the making of advances by Government instrumentalities to persons engaged in agricultural pursuits
for the purpose of erecting dwelling-houses on their holdings.
PROVISION FOR STATE ASSISTANCE FOR HOUSES PURCHASED
THROUGH NON-GOVERNMENT INSTRUMENTALITIES.
(a) Homes Act, 1941.
Under this Act the Treasurer is authorised to guarantee advances made for the purchase or erection
of dwelling-houses by institutions such as the Savings Bank of South Australia, the South Australian
Superannuation Fund Board, and certain friendly societies and building societies. The guarantee is given
in respect of the margin of the advance between 70 per cent, and 90 per cent, of the valuation of the
property in question. The loan is not to exceed £l,OOO nor 90 per cent, of the valuation and the maximum
rate of interest chargeable (except penalty interest) is not to exceed 5 per cent.
The Act also provides that the Savings Bank and any approved institution may acquire land and
erect dwelling-houses for sale. Power is also provided for such an institution to erect, complete or enlarge
a dwelling-house on land owned by the person to whom the advance is made. These latter powers have
not been exercised as yet.
A total of 833 advances have been guaranteed by the Treasurer. These advances were to the
total amount of £668,204 upon properties valued at £779,443 ; the amount guaranteed by the Treasurer
is £123,606.
( b ) Building Societies Act, 1891-1938.
As early as 1850 an Act was passed for the regulation of benefit building societies as some had
already been established. It was superseded by the Building Societies Act, 1881-1938. By 1910 there
were seven permanent and seventeen terminating societies in existence. Sixteen of the latter were
Starr-Bowkett Societies, the idea having gained favour as in New South Wales. The movement remained
static. In 1939, six permanent and fifteen Starr-Bowkett societies were still functioning.


In 1938 legislation was enacted to enable the Treasurer to indemnify losses incurred by building
socieues in respect of any loss on an advance made by the society for the erection of a dwelling house
which is attributable to the amount in excess of 80 per cent, of the value of the security. Loans under
this scheme may be made of an amount up to £550 and up to 90 per cent, of the value of the security On
account of the war these provisions have not yet been put into operation.
PROVISION FOR THE MAKING OF ADVANCES, ETC., BY THE
SAVINGS BANK OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
In addition to the powers provided by the Homes Act, 1941, the Savings Bank of South Australia
has power, under the Savings Bank of South Australia Act, 1929-1942, to purchase land and build houses
These powers have not yet been exercised. Under the latter Act the Savings Bank also has power to
advance money upon mortgage of land and at the present time an amount of approximately £3,000,000
is outstanding upon mortgage loans on dwelling-house properties.
WESTERN AUSTRALIA.
BUILDING LEGISLATION.
Local authorities make their own building by-laws under the Municipal Corporations Act, 1906-38,
and the Roads District Act, 1919-42. They are also empowered to adopt the model by-laws of the
Department of Public Health or otherwise frame their own under Section 98 of the Health Act, 191 1-42.
The City of Perth operates under the same Acts and revised its building regulations in 1929.
The Health Act, 1898, first included powers for local government authorities to pass by-laws to
prevent overcrowding, insanitary or uninhabitable housing. These provisions were based on those of
the Victorian Health Act, 1890.
The Department of Health has framed model by-laws which local authorities may adopt to
supplement building by-laws passed under the Municipalities and Roads Boards Acts.
GOVERNMENT BODIES.
The Workers’ Homes Act of 1912 created a Board with power to build and to rent or sell workers’
dwellings. The Board may make advances to people of limited means to acquire homes for themselves.
These advances are made under two distinct sections of the Act on freehold and leasehold land. The
freehold section provides for applicants with an income of less than £4OO per annum. Applicants must
own their land and advances are made up to £9OO or 90 per cent, of the valuation. Under the leasehold
section the Board erects homes on leasehold land and requires a deposit of £5. Maximum advance is also
£9OO, and income limit £4OO per annum.
In 1933 a small loans scheme was introduced to create employment and to facilitate repairs and
improvements to properties.
The Board has done no building for rent, nor has it any power to undertake slum clearance.
In addition to its normal activities, it administers the McNess Housing Trust Act, 1930, and the
War Service Homes Act, 1918 (since 1922). The Trust was created by funds provided from the McNess
bequests, grants from the Lotteries Commission and the Commonwealth Unemployment Grant. These
are employed to assist pensioners or widows and deserted wives with families, and other deserving people
who cannot afford to acquire or rent a home ordinarily. Trust properties are either free, rented at
five shillings per week, or can be purchased under fee simple tenure by payment of monthly instalments.
NON-GOVERNMENT BODIES.
Building Societies were regulated under the ordinance for the Regulation of Building Societies,
1863. Only three of twelve societies in existence in 1902 were founded before 1889 ; at present there
are six permanent (plus one in liquidation), one dual purpose, two Starr-Bowkett.
Building Societies are now registered under the Building Societies Act, 1920, which lays down
certain requirements for their constitution similar to the British. The Act does not permit them to
build or to acquire land, except for the conduct of their own businesses, or by foreclosure—in the latter
case the land must be disposed of as soon as practicable, nor does the Government give them a guarantee
of any kind.
TASMANIA.
BUILDING LEGISLATION.
The Building Act of 1937 and regulations promulgated thereunder govern building in the towns
of Hobart and Launceston. Municipalities may declare themselves as a building area under the Act, but
a number have not yet done so.
The Health Act, 1903, consolidating previous Acts, contained provisions similar to those contained
in the Victorian Act, 1890, in regard to overcrowding and houses unfit for habitation. Further, it gave
municipalities power to make by-laws concerning structure, space, drainage, etc. This Act has now been
superseded by the Public Health Act, 1935.


GOVERNMENT BODIES.
The Agricultural Bank of Tasmania has administered all housing legislation in Tasmania. Operations
began with the Homes Act, 1919, which empowered the Bank to :
Make advances to an eligible person (that is, a person who satisfied the Board that he was
married or about to marry, or had dependants for whom it was necessary for him to provide a home
and whose income did not exceed the stipulated figure) for the following purposes :
(i) To erect as a home for himself and his dependants a dwelling-house on his holding.
(ii) To purchase land and erect a dwelling-house thereon.
(iii) To purchase a dwelling-house together with the land on which it is erected, or which is.
occupied therewith, as a home for himself and his dependants.
(iv) To complete a partially erected dwelling-house owned by him.
(v) To enlarge a dwelling-house owned by him.
(vi) To discharge any mortgage, charge or encumbrance already existing on his holding.
(vii) To defray the cost of any work which the Board has caused to be done on his holding.
The Bank also had the power to purchase land and erect homes thereon or purchase homes already
erected.
Four hundred and sixty-nine (469) homes were made available in this way up to 1929, when
operations ceased owing to lack of funds.
Operations were resumed in 1934 and since then 666 homes have been built, of which 150 have
been constructed in groups for the sake of greater economy.
Conditions have been liberalised from time to time and legislative restrictions as to the income
of the applicant and the amount to be advanced have been removed. As a matter of policy, however,
the Board of Management will not advance more than £1,500 to any individual.
Homes erected under the group schemes are sold to eligible applicants on rent-purchase terms
either with or without deposit, and the successful applicant pays a weekly sum sufficient to repay principal
over a period of thirty years, together with interest, rates, taxes and insurance.
Provision was made in 1938 for the construction of homes for casual workers and unemployed
persons. Twelve (12) homes were erected under this scheme, which are being purchased on liberal
terms with payments of 16/- weekly. Improved economic conditions, however, have not required the
erection of any further homes under this scheme.
Provision is also made under the Homes (Old-age Pensioners) Act for the construction of homes
for old-age pensioners and subsidisation of their cost in order to reduce rentals to 8/6d. weekly. Six (6)
homes have been constructed under this scheme.
Legislation was passed in 1941 to assist person earning the basic wage and less to purchase their
own homes. Under this scheme a subsidy of 25 per cent, of the capital cost is provided from State Revenue.
Under the Housing Improvement Act, 1938, the Government is empowered to guarantee approved
financial institutions making advances for home building against loss on realisation of their security to
the extent of the difference between 65 per cent, of the capital value and the amount owing to the
institution at the date of realisation. Five institutions have been registered under this Act and eighty
homes constructed.
Under the Homes (Burnie Paper Mills) Act, 1936, the Board was empowered to erect homes for
employees of the Associated Pulp and Paper Mills, Burnie, and the Company guaranteed any loss on
realisation in excess of 60 per cent, of the capital value.
NON-GOVERNMENT BODIES.
The Building Societies Act, 1876, required the registration of building societies, five of which were
in existence by 1890—all of them permanent. The Tasmanian Permanent Building Society was forced
to suspend payments in 1891 owing to the withdrawals of depositors. Building societies developed no
further after this date. Four of them were still functioning in 1939.

(a) the tenant has committed waste, or has been guilty of con-
duct which is a nuisance or an annoyance to adjoining or
neighbouring occupiers or has been convicted of using the;
premises or allowing, suffering, or permitting the premises
to be used for an immoral or illegal purpose, and the court;
considers it reasonable to make such an order or give suchl
a judgment ;

to the rent paid by the tenant, is unreasonable, and the court!

of some tenant from him, and the court, after considering!
all the circumstances of the case, including especially the!
alternative accommodation available for the tenant, considers
it reasonable to make such an order or give such a judgment ;
(e) the landlord has entered into a contract to sell the house,
under which contract he is obliged to give vacant possession
of the house to the buyer and has received not less than
twenty per centum of the purchase money ;
(f) the tenant has given notice of his intention to quit, and in
consequence of that notice the landlord has contracted to
let the house or has taken other steps as a result of which
he would, in the opinion of the court, be seriously prejudiced
if he could not obtain possession ;
( g) the house is reasonably required by the landlord for demo-
lition, or for reconstruction to a substantial extent, and the
court is satisfied that greater hardship would be caused by
refusing to grant an order or judgment for possession than
by granting it ;
( h ) the house is reasonably required by the landlord for the
purpose of enabling him to comply with the requirements
of a council, a local court (Central Board of Health) or the
Housing Authority ; or
(/) the tenant was in the employment of the landlord and the
house was let to him in consequence of that employment,
and he has ceased to be in that employment.

the recovery of possession of any such house or for the ejectment of a
tenant from the house, or in the case of any such order or judgment
which has been made or given, whether before or after the
commencement of this Act or the coming into force of any
notice under section thirty-one of this Act with respect to the house,
and not executed, at any subsequent time, the court may stay or sus-
pend execution of the order or judgment or postpone the date of
possession, for such period or periods as it thinks fit, either uncon-
ditionally or subject to such conditions in regard to payment by the
tenant of rent or mesne profits and otherwise, as the court thinks fit,
and if such conditions are complied with, the court may, if it thinks
fit, discharge or rescind such order or judgment.
(3) Where any order or judgment in respect of any house has
been made or given before the commencement of this Act, or the
coming into force of any notice under section thirty-one of this Act
with respect to the house, but not executed and, in the opinion of
the court, the order or judgment would not have been made or given
if this Division had been in force at the time when the order or judg-
ment was made or given the court may, on application by the tenant
rescind or vary the order or judgment in such manner as the court
thinks fit for the purpose of giving effect to this Division.

or any other Act, a warrant for delivery of possession of a house which
in pursuance of that Act and apart from this section would remain in
force for any fixed period prescribed in that behalf, shall remain in
force for such further period or periods, if any, as the court, whether
before or after the expiration of such fixed period, directs.

Appendix VII.
Comments on Land Nationalisation.
Any practicable method of land nationalisation will involve compensation to the present owners of
the land. Compulsory acquisition without compensation would penalise owners of land as compared
with owners of other property. Any major change necessarily involves hardship to some individuals.
It should, however, be possible to see that these hardships are neither widespread nor acute; it is irrational
to condemn a change merely because it involves a difficult transitional period.
The main objections that have been raised to land nationalisation are:
(1) That development is more rapid under private enterprise.
(2) Difficulty of a reasonable assessment of compensation.
(3) The difficulty of raising sufficient funds to compensate for resumption.
(4) The danger of inflation from an increase in the liquid assets of a large number of individuals.
(5) The administrative difficulties of making assessments and payments of compensation over a short
period.
Even if it were true that development is more rapid under private enterprise, the results of private
development in the past have convinced the majority of people of the need for control and planning. The
nation has paid a high cost for private enterprise in disorganised development, and in loss of betterment
which has been allowed to accrue to individuals.
None of the practical difficulties mentioned above is fundamental. If it is accepted that
nationalisation in itself is desirable, it should be possible to evolve a satisfactory method of transition.
This method would, of course, have to be fully investigated, and consideration could be given to the
following methods :
(1) Present controls under National Security (Economic Organisation) Regulations, over land
values and land sales would be retained at least until the transfer to nationalisation had been
completed.
(2) On a given date, it would be declared that ownership of all land reverts to the Crown, and will
be replaced either by a perpetual leasehold system with a re-appraisement period of, say, ten
years, or by a lease of a fixed period with the right of renewal under certain conditions.
(3) The administration of present controls involve acceptance of various current methods of valuing
land. It is realised that there are many anomalies in the systems of valuation employed at
present, but these are not sufficiently serious to prevent their adoption, for the purpose of
transfering land to the Government. Compensation would be paid for the unimproved value
only.
(4) The difficulty of raising funds to pay for the land resumption and the danger of currency inflation
are avoided if payments are made by irredeemable government bonds. This would transfer
capital investment from the illiquid one of land to more liquid bonds. There would be no
danger to the financial stability of the country provided that these bonds were sold no more
freely than the land was previously. Any abnormal desire to sell bonds might disorganise the
bond market. This could be safeguarded to some extent by spreading the issue of the bonds
over a period. (See (5) below.)
(5) In order to reduce administrative difficulties and to prevent possible disorganisation of the
bond market and inflation of current purchasing power, payments of compensation would only
be made for the land resumed when it is transferred to another owner, or by the end of the
first valuation period. The leasehold title would be issued at the same time. Transfer of land
would need to be limited in somewhat the same way as sales of land and property are controlled
at present. (See (I) above.)
(6) Rent °n the land resumed would become payable from the date of resumption, but provided
that this rent is equated to the interest payable on the debentures to be issued in compensation,
no money payments would be required until the land is revalued.
(7) Valuation of land under a system of nationalisation would be difficult, as present valuations are
based on market values. It is assumed, however, that some method of revaluation would be
used, and also, that land values would rise with an increasing population and extended utilities.
The increased rents resulting from higher land values might be used to redeem the bonds issued
in compensation.

Due consideration must be given to the climatic conditions of the various zones (tropical,
sub-tropical, temperate and cool) in which a dwelling is proposed to be erected, but each dwelling in
temperate and cool zones must be sited on an allotment so that the maximum amount of natural lighting
and ventilation should be provided in each case, and in addition thereto in tropical and sub-tropical
the value of shade in respect to wall surface, openings, etc., must be considered.
Section B. —Dampness and Drainage of Allotment or Unit Site. —A dwelling unit shall not be erected on
any land liable to be flooded, or inundated by water, unless all sewerage inlets and lowest floor are
constructed at an approved level, but in no case lower than 12 inches above highest recorded water ' /el,
or unless approved measures have been taken to prevent the retention of flood waters beneath the
buildings.

Access is to be provided to sleepout from second or third bedroom or from
separate passage.
Additional wardrobe space to be provided adjacent to sleepout.
Verandah. —All verandahs should be ceiled. Where a verandah is of the open type, it should be
calculated as half its total area.
Sleepout. —All sleepouts should be ceiled. The design of the sleepout will depend on the locality,
the area to be enclosed, and the nature of the construction. It is, therefore, assumed that in most cases,
the s eepout will be of a lighter construction than the main carcase of the dwelling unit, and should be
calculated as half its total area.


Kitchen. —-Where the kitchen is separated from the living space and is totally enclosed, it shall have
a minimum floor area of 80 sq. ft. of the total allowable area of the living space. If the area is less than
80 sq. ft. it shall have an internal opening of not less than 4 feet in width.
Allowable Percentages. —The allowable percentages should give a marginal variation for planning.
This variation may be necessary because of local site and aspect requirements, or by planning the reduction
of hall or porch space, which would enable the provision of a larger verandah. It is also necessary for
variation in design.
In dwelling units of two storeys in height or multi-storey dwellings, no definite allowable percentage
for stairways, and lifts, can be laid down, because of the planning and the number of dwelling units to be
serviced by stairways and lifts.
If an increase in the allowable percentage is required, it shall be submitted to the Commonwealth
Housing Authority for approval.
Rural Areas, Tropical and Sub-Tropical Zones. —The allowable percentage above the total floor area
of rooms shall be increased by 4 per cent, for types “ A,” “ B,” “ C,” “ D,” and “ E ” for rural areas
and tropical and sub-tropical zones, to provide additional verandah and shade accommodation. This
increased percentage will also apply to attached dwelling units and multi-storey dwellings.
The zones, which are to be regarded as rural areas, tropical and sub-tropical, shall be, for the present,
determined by the State Housing Authorities.
Section 13. —Heights of Various Rooms.
In all classes of dwellings the minimum height of all rooms shall not be less than 9 feet measured
from floor to ceiling, but, where habitable rooms are built wholly or partly in the roof area, the height
from floor to ceiling shall not be less th'an 9 feet for at least 50 per cent, of the area of such rooms, and
the walls of such rooms shall not be less than 7 feet measured at the lowest point vertically.
In multi-storey dwellings (Class 3) beams, service pipes, or ducts, may project below the minimum
height prescribed, provided that such projections do not reduce headroom below 8 feet.
PART IV.—CONSTRUCTION.
Section 14.— Materials for Construction.
All materials that are to be used in the erection of each class of building, where “ The Standards
are applicable, shall conform to the requirements as laid down in all Standards Association of Australia
Codes, but in all cases these requirements shall be subject to the approval of the State Housing Authority.
Section 15. —Light and Ventilation.
In each dwelling unit, all rooms shall have adequate natural light supplied to them by means of one
or more windows opening directly into the external air, with an unrestricted area of light, clear of all
sashes and frames, proportionate to the floor area of the room, in a ratio to be determined as suitable
for the climatic zone in which they are erected. In tropical and sub-tropical zones the windows may
open on to verandahs, which can be enclosed by louvres or windows provided they are capable of being
opened to the extent of at least 75 per cent, of their area.
In addition to the ventilation afforded by the opening portions of the windows, there shall be
provided such vents, cowls or ducts, sufficient to ensure air circulation, the area of which shall be
proportioned to each climatic zone, as will be determined by the State Housing Authority.
Section 16. —Restoration of Buildings and Alteration to Existing Buildings.
(a) Where any existing dwelling is altered, demolished or pulled down, to an extent in excess of
50 per cent, of the floor area of the existing building, then the entire dwelling shall be made to conform
to the requirements of “ The Standards.”
(b) If the section or portion of any existing dwelling in which ” The Standards are applicable,
is to be altered or renewed, then the alterations or renewal of that section shall be brought up to ” The
Standards.”
(c) In all cases the extent and quality of the work is subject to the approval of the State Housing
Authority.
Section 17. —Precautionary Measures Against Insects.
(a) In areas where flies or other insects are troublesome, the doors and windows of the living
space shall be screened with fly-wire gauze. These areas shall be determined by the State Housing
Authority.
(b) In tropical and sub-tropical zones where open verandahs are included in dwellings, portion
of these areas shall be enclosed with wire gauze as proof against insects ; the areas enclosed shall be subject
to the approval of the State Housing Authority.
(c) Precaution Against Termites and Borers.— Precautionary measures shall be taken to guard against
termites and borers to the approval of the State Housing Authority.
Section 18.— Structural Standards Pending Framing of Commonwealth Uniform Building Code.
DURING THE INTERIM PERIOD OF THE FRAMING OF THE CODE (see paragraphs 631-637 of
the Report), EACH STATE HOUSING AUTHORITY SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO FORWARD TO
THE COMMONWEALTH HOUSING AUTHORITY FOR APPROVAL A GENERAL SPECIFICATION
COVERING DOMESTIC CONSTRUCTION.


PART V.—STANDARD EQUIPMENT.
Section 19.
To each dwelling there shall be provided the following equipment, such equipment to be approved
by the State Housing Authority :

Appendix XI.
System of Points Priorities for allotting Post-War
Dwellings.
(1) Applicants for dwellings in each housing project will be of different types, and will fall within
different preference groups. This method of allotment provides an automatic adjustment to these
variations.
(2) Advantage of any fairly rigid system of allotment is that criticism or pressure must be
concentrated on the system itself, and not on its application to particular individuals. The allotment
of points may be challenged, and can be varied where the challenge is upheld, but if the allotment of points
is accepted, the allocation of dwellings to particular individuals must be also accepted.
(3) Rapid expansion of government-sponsored housing will involve the employment by housing
authorities of persons inexperienced in housing administration. The allotment of the dwellings is more
likely to be speedy and equitable, if the method employed minimises the subjective judgments made by
the persons responsible for the allotment.
(4) The method is equitable in its operation, and thus should be readily accepted once people
understand how it operates. The majority of people will not object to some preference in allotment
being given to all the categories listed in Table I. Most criticism would be concentrated on the allotment
of points to different categories.

Appendix XII.
Method of calculating Rental Rebates.
There are man/ methods of calculating rental rebates. Most have some particular advantages,
offset by corresponding disadvantages. In the opinion of this Commission, the main requirements for a
satisfactory system of rental rebates are that :
(1) the rents payable are adjusted to the capacity to pay ;
(2) the calculations are easy to make from the point of view of administration ; and
(3) the method is easy for the tenant to understand.
Quoted below is a system of rebate, partially based on that, at present, in operation by the Victorian
Housing Commission. It satisfies the first of the conditions listed above. It is doubtful, however, if it
satisfies the third condition. It may be desirable to sacrifice some degree of equity in order to simplify
the calculations so that they may be readily understood. One possible simplification would be not to
adjust the family income to allow for children, but to make a flat deduction from the rent for each child
under 16 years of age after the first.
The system suggested is :
(1) The rebate shall be based on the family income, not the income of the main breadwinner only.
Family income will include the whole of the husband’s income, plus two-thirds of the wife’s
(exclusive of child endowment) and one-third of each child’s, with a maximum of 30s. per week
from the income of each child.* Where the child’s income is less than 10/- per week it shall
not be included in calculating the family income.
In calculating the family income for purpose of rebates, 5/- per week shall be deducted
for each child under 16 years of age after the first.
Note. -—This allowance is based on the assumption that approximately 10/- per week is
required to keep each child, and that of this amount 5/- per week is provided by child endowment.
In the case where one parent only is supported by the family income, 10/- per week shall
be added to the family income to offset the cost of maintaining the other parent.
(2) The economic rent of a dwelling shall be calculated according to the formula contained in
Appendix XIII.
(3) The rent rebate shall consist of the difference between the economic rent and the agreed
proportion of the family income, calculated as in (I).
(4) As the family income falls below the basic wage, the rebate will be increased by 3d. for every I/-
until the rent is reduced to 8/- per week. (See —(5)).
In the case of childless couples, the rebate will commence at 10/- below the basic wage.
(5) In no case shall a rebate be permitted to reduce the rent below 8/- per week.
* The child’s income shall be taken into consideration only where the child is living with his parents.


Appendix XIII.
Calculation of Economic Rent.
Set out below is a formula for calculating the economic rent'of gbvernment-financed dwellings
for rental. It is designed as a basis for discussion with State Housing Authorities, and may need
modification to allow for local conditions.

NOTES.
1. Land.
There is some justification for the opinion that no allowance should be made for amortisation of
the capital cost of the land on the grounds that it remains a permanent asset of the Housing Authority.
On the other hand, the amount for purchasing and developing the land will presumably be raised by loan.
All government loans are subject to sinking fund provisions. If these amounts are not provided by a charge
on the economic rent, they will have to be paid from some other source of revenue. Amortisation of
the capital cost of the land has, therefore, been included in the formula above.
Consideration has not been given to the calculation of rent after the repayment of the capital cost
of land, as it is considered impossible to anticipate housing conditions sixty years hence.
2. Maintenance.
The percentages for maintenance have not been recommended and have been left to the
determination of the State Housing Authority with regard to the type of construction and the varied
climatic and local conditions.
3. Vacancies, Defaults, etc.
In some government housing projects tenants have been selected according to their likelihood
of being a “ good risk.” As government housing is extended with the object of housing those who cannot
adequately house themselves and their families, the allowance necessary to cover contingencies may,
for a time, be higher than in the past. The allowance of 5 per cent, to be added is recommended, subject
to adjustment as agreed between the Commonwealth Housing Authority and the administering authority

As many laws, regulations and by-laws governing buildings and services to buildings tend to direct
design in a way that does not always progress with modern development, competitors will be free to
depart from them in any way they desire consistent with good design and good practice. This condition
should not be interpreted to encourage departures from accepted practice, but to remove any obstacle
that might otherwise prejudice scientific and practical development.
In the report accompanying each entry special reference must be made to each departure and
enumerating the reasons why the existing law, regulation or by-law is restrictive or otherwise undesirable
or inadequate, and the reasons why the alternative is sound and desirable.
The only exception to the above are regulations governing any form of transport and any design
or method involving the transport by public conveyance of prefabricated or factory-assembled units or
parts must conform to the regulations governing the type of conveyance to be used.
THE PROBLEM.
General.—Sections I and 2.
In the post-war period, dwellings of all types will be required in great numbers to satisfy the needs
of the community. The needs are greater than they have ever been in our history, and although it is not
possible to estimate them accurately until a survey has been taken it is known that in the immediate
post-war years we will need, in addition to our normal requirements for these years, a considerable
number of dwellings to wipe out the deficiency, and as soon as possible replace all existing slum and
sub-standard housing with modern dwellings.
For the purpose of this competition it can be assumed as a basis of computing estimates that the
output will be 1,000 units per year. The nation’s needs will obviously be many times this figure, but
as the gross total will include dwellings of all types, in all parts of the Commonwealth and of all systems
of construction, the basis of 1,000 units per year will probably have some relation to the number that
any one construction system might be expected to command.
Competitors may select any type of dwelling they wish to illustrate their system of construction.
As the competition is for a construction design and not a building design, the type of plan adopted will
not influence the assessors unless the method is not suitable or adaptable for the construction of well-
designed family dwellings.
SITE.
Competitors can assume any average building site and provide for all restrictive factors commonly
met with, such as irregular contours, widely varying kinds of ground formation, difficulties of access, etc.
BUILDING.
Each entry must provide for a complete building from foundations to roof covering and adequately
describe all structural and finishing details. All services within the dwelling, such as water, sewer and
waste, gas, electricity, etc., must be indicated and method of installation referred to, but not necessarily
designed, as these are the subject of separate sections of the competition.


Section I.— Dwelling constructed principally of concrete.
Designs submitted under this section should provide for the use of concrete and exclude the use
of other materials as far as is practically and economically possible.
The type and mixture of concrete, method of mixing, forming and placing, size, quantity and position
of reinforcement, method of handling and assembly, method and type of finish both internally externally
are all matters for the competitors to determine, and must be fully described in the plans,Specification or
Section 2. Dwelling constructed of any material or combination of materials.
Designs submitted under this section can provide for the use of any material in any way, and can
include new materials which the competitor may wish to develop. All neX materials which are provided
SsX e ;Tihrsev e e,o fU p^ent eSCnbed $ ° ™ -nomic
Section 3. —Standard furniture and fittings.
The design, as well as the construction, is important in this section and will be considered together
by the assessors. 6
■f j j an b u G assumecl that the furniture and fittings are for a family dwelling occupied by a husband,
wife and daughter, aged 16, son, aged 11, and child of 3 years. They are a family of moderate means and
habits, and require the average equipment needed in such a household.
Competitors in this section are to submit designs and specification or report for at least the
following furniture, cupboards and equipment (excluding mechanical equipment) constructed of any
material or combination of materials. '
Living room and dining room or dining alcove.—Seating (possibly, but not compulsory, table, bookcase,
radio, etc.). Table and seating, also storage for crockery, cutlery, table linen, etc., if not provided
elsewhere.
Bedrooms.— Bed, or beds, dressing facilities, and robe and clothes storage.
Kitchen. Storage cupboards for food, cooking and preparation utensils, cutlery, crockery, etc.
(including built-in cabinet for refrigerator). Equipment or space to be provided for the
preparation and serving of food.
Laundry. Storage for cleansing materials and equipment, soiled and washed clothes, also ironing
facilities.
Cupboards generally. —Storage for cloaks, household linen, etc.
Section 4.— Standard Joinery.
The design as well as the construction and method of use or assembly is important in this section
and will be considered together by the assessors. The materials can be timber or any other material or
combination of materials.
It is desired for the purposes of economy consistent with efficiency to limit the number of types,
sizes, shapes, finishes, etc., of joinery articles used in dwelling construction to the lowest possible number
of standard components. Competitors under this section are to submit drawings and specification of
the components which can be used for the following purposes :
Windows and doors for every place in a dwelling where windows and doors are used, showing size,
construction, materials and finish, and method of attachment to shell of building.
Trims. —Method of finish between floors and walls, ceilings and walls, finish to doors, windows,
other openings and walls (showing method of placing electric light and power outlets).
Section s.— Electrical wiring.
In this section competitors are to submit designs and methods of manufacture or assembly and
installation of standard electrical wiring that will provide the maximum safety, efficiency and economy.
Competitors may assume that 3-phase A.C. supply is available.
Competitors are to assume the number of light and power outlets to be provided, and the system
must be sufficiently adaptable to provide for the variety of needs in the various types of dwellings.
The following standards of illumination are to be provided for :
A general light of 6 to 8 foot candles to all rooms, except bedrooms, where 4 to 6 foot candles are
required. All locations for reading, sewing, studying, etc., to be illuminated to 20-foot candles, and the
general work space in kitchen and bedroom dressing tables to be illuminated to 10-foot candles.
The design of the actual light fitting is not necessary unless a suitable type of fitting for the method
proposed is not available. Competitors may assume the use of any type and number of lights and fittings
consistent with economy and efficiency to obtain standards of illumination provided above.
The design to provide for reticulation from the distribution board to each outlet or article of
electric equipment. A layout of the distribution board to be submitted showing circuit breakers, method
of earthing, and any other pertinent details.

PLANNING.
The open type of planning is assumed to be more suitable for tropical and sub-tropical climates
and has been used with the principle of having only one room in depth so that full advantage can be taken
of the prevailing breeze for cross ventilation. It would be preferable for the building not to be placed
at right-angles to the prevailing breeze but slightly off the line so that the louvred ends of the roof would
collect sufficient of the breeze to enable them to function for the purpose for which they have been
designed. The roof designed in this manner, together with the insulation between the joists of the
ceiling of the first floor, should have a marked effect to reducing the temperature of the rooms.
This design is not intended to indicate standard of allowable areas.


TROPICAL HOUSE.
The design is based on a prefabricated modular framework with a unit of 3 feet centre to centre.
The lower framework is concrete piers, whilst upper framework is infilled with fibrous cement and
adjustable louvre panels.

PLANNING.
The open type of planning is assumed to be more suitable for tropical climates and has been used.
Open verandahs on three sides form valuable shade to the bedrooms, whilst the remaining portion of
the house with its louvred panels allows for the maximum of cross ventilation, and it is preferable for
the building to be sited at approximately right angles to the prevailing breeze.
The roof is designed of a double type in units and is open above the ceiling of rooms, which enables
sufficient of the breeze to pass through and over ceilings, thus having a marked effect on reducing the
temperature of the rooms.
This design is not intended to indicate standard of allowable areas.

Housing Planning Principles.
PLANNING PRINCIPLES.
Introduction I.
These Information Sheets have been prepared for the purpose of setting out the fundamental
planning principles of Housing.
In view of the great amount of work to be done in the Housing field, it was considered that these
Information Sheets, as well as presenting data might be useful in presenting in simple form the main
planning principles for the purpose of guiding and assisting designers and other members of the staff
of technical and administrative bodies.
It is emphasised that these principles should not be regarded as set rules for planning but as
suggestions to be considered so that good results may be obtained.
The sheets are listed in detail in the index, and comprise four main groups :
(1) General sheets of data for solar planning, and those sheets which refer to general subjects.
(2) Site subdivision and development.
(3) Multi-storey dwelling units.
(4) Single-storey dwelling units.
It was found necessary for the purpose of these sheets to define the meaning of certain terms,
which have been listed as a Glossary of Terms.
The subject matter on the sheets is complete as presented, but further research on other aspects
of the subject and on numerous details remains to be done.
The preparatory data on climatic conditions for the division of Australia into planning zones has
been included, also the preliminary research on Site Selection.
It has generally been the practice in Australia to accept overseas standards as satisfactory here.
It has been the policy in these sheets to investigate conditions here ; to find, if possible, a scientific basis
for a decision in the matter, and to compare it with standards of overseas solutions, giving those examples
their due consideration, and adjusting any decisions as may be thought necessary in the light of practical
experience.
On subjects such as the size of allotments, angles of light, etc., it was felt quite unreasonable to
adopt overseas practice as binding, as the conditions are totally different in this country.
It has been the aim throughout to present the information in an objective manner, and in the full
appreciation that, providing the principles are fully understood, in practice each problem should be
considered on its own merits, that local conditions should be considered carefully, and that no ready-
made answers can be supplied to questions of this nature.
It is intended that the findings of the research and any recommendations that follow, should be
studied, and that certain examples where preliminary assumptions have been made, should be used as a
guide indicating relative advantages of one method compared with another.
Where examples of density, coverage, etc., are shown, and the resulting figures are tabulated, in
most cases the conditions at Sydney, New South Wales, form the basis of the study. It is emphasised
that the figures only apply to the particular area forming the basis of the study, and that a study can be
made on similar lines for other cities and districts of Australia, from the data supplied for those areas.
Solar Planning has been dealt with at some length and information on the angles of altitude and
azimuth of various capital cities has been provided.
Though in a general way architect-designed homes are planned to suit the aspect, in the majority
of dwelling units erected, however, orientation is hardly considered at all, and the relation of the main
rooms to the road is usually the first consideration.
In view of the benefits to health of light, sunshine, etc., as shown in the increased window areas
in hospitals, schools, etc., all recommended by the medical profession and public health authorities* and
the particular appreciation of sunshine shown by the Australian people in their outdoor life, it is felt
that the scientific basis for solar planning should be more fully and deeply understood by all those connected
with Housing.


Introduction 2.
The desirable spacing of multi-storey dwelling units according to solar planning principles has
been investigated for various aspects in Sydney, New South Wales. In the past, when little
consideration was given to layout principles, many multi-storey dwelling units were erected without
sufficient ventilation and sunlight, or surrounding area of gardens, parks, etc., for good living
conditions, with the result that many people regard this type of dwelling unit with disfavour.
It is felt that if these principles form the basis of the layout and the areas of rooms and the equipment
are similar to those of single-dwelling units, the multi-storey dwelling unit can provide a high standard
of living conditions.
Generally, solar planning considerations are important in fixing the distance between dwelling
units. In the areas in the north of Australia the spacing of dwelling units needs to be based on the
requirements of garden space, privacy, etc., rather than on solar planning considerations. Because the
angles of the sun are much greater than in southern areas, spacing of dwelling units based on solar planning
considerations, is too close for good living conditions.
With a study of insulation and construction methods, solar planning might be of great assistance
in the problems of heating and cooling a dwelling unit.
Window sizes, widths of balconies, eaves, aspects of rooms, location of sites, etc., are all influenced
by solar planning considerations and may be determined from the angles given for each area.

PLANNING PRINCIPLES: SOLAR PLANNING.
Ref. Pg. | o.
Planning to gain the greatest benefit and the least discomfort from sunlight is referred to as Solar
Planning. For reasons of health and comfort it is desirable in most urban areas of Australia that winter
sunlight should penetrate well into the interior of the dwelling unit. It will be realised that in these
areas the altitude of the winter sun is low before 9 a.m. and after 3 p.m., and its strength comparatively
weak. It is therefore recommended that dwelling units should be planned to receive sunlight for at
least 6 hours per day in midwinter, between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. It is from this requirement that many of
the planning principles set out have been evolved.

NEW SOUTH WALES.
Solar Planning in relation to the desirable aspect for the rooms of a dwelling unit.
The following information is based on conditions prevailing at Sydney, New South Wales. The
resulting principles are applicable for most urban areas of Australia.
For the purpose of Solar Planning it is considered that the living room is of most importance and
should receive as much winter sunlight as possible, particularly in the afternoon. The kitchen and the
bedrooms are next in importance ; the kitchen generates much of its own heat throughout the day and
should therefore not face either north or west, but rather south-east to east, so that it will receive only
early morning sunlight. The bedrooms are better with an east to north aspect to gain full benefit from
the morning sun ; a bedroom facing west has the disadvantage that it is apt to|retain summer heat well
into the night. The dining room is used throughout the day and should if possiblefhave aspect,
while for the bathroom used for the most part in the early morning an east aspect is to be preferred.

THIS SHEET SETS OUT THE MANNER IN WHICH SOLAR PLANNING PRINCIPLES
SHOULD BE APPLIED.
The illustrations show the effect that projections and aspect have in determining the amount of
sunlight entering the dwelling unit.
In many areas of Australia it is considered desirable for the rooms of a dwelling unit to obtain as
much sunlight as possible in the winter months. In the summer, however, it is usually desirable to
protect the interior of the dwelling unit from the sun.
SECTIONS SHOWING THE EFFECT OF PROJECTIONS ON SUNLIGHT AT NOON, SYDNEY, NEW SOUTH WALES.
S indicates angle of sun, noon, summer.
W indicates angle of sun, noon, winter
These diagrams have been set up on the basis that the external walls shown receiving sunlight
face north. To determine the amount of penetration for any other aspect or any other time of the day,
it is necessary to study the angles of altitude and azimuth applying to each case.
It will be seen from these diagrams that a small projection is sufficient to shelter a wall facing north
from the midsummer sun, and that even large projections allow some winter sun into rooms.
PLANS SHOWING PENETRATION OF SUNLIGHT INTO ROOMS IN SUMMER AND WINTER, SYDNEY,
NEW SOUTH WALES.

Rooms with window opening facing north.
Midwinter. Midsummer.
Rooms with window openings facing west.
These diagrams of rooms and window openings of certain assumed dimensions, show the number
of hours for which the floor areas indicated receive sunlight during the day, between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m.
The height of the window head, the height of the sill and the depths of the reveals have a direct
bearing on the amount of sunlight admitted to a room.
It can be seen that rooms with openings facing north receive the maximum amount of sunlight
in midwinter and the minimum amount in midsummer, while rooms with openings facing east or west
receive more direct sunlight in the summer than in the winter.
To improve the winter sunlight conditions for rooms with windows facing east or west, it is
necessary to provide more open or window area, as shown, and at the same time make some provision,
such as shutters or hoods to keep out the hot summer sun.

Application of Data. —The angles of the sun’s rays are lowest in winter, and therefore the length
of the shadow cast by a building is greatest. This length, taken in the direction of the sun’s rays, shown
on diagrams as “ x,” should be a determining factor in placing dwelling units. In order to obtain sunlight
for 6 hours per day from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. in midwinter, which is considered a desirable standard of sunshine
for dwelling units, buildings should be placed outside this shadow area. Where buildings are planned
to suit this condition they would obtain approximately 11 hours of sunshine in midsummer. The length
“x” can be determined from the height of the building and the angle of the sun’s rays. The length
of shadow “ y ” at right-angles to the building can be determined similarly after “ x ” has been found.
The angles of the sun’s rays are highest in summer and these will indicate the projection of eaves,
verandahs, hoods, etc., necessary to keep the sun off walls, door and window openings.

Application of Data. —ln Darwin it is desirable to protect the walls, doors, and window openings
from the direct sun rather than to design the dwelling units to obtain the maximum amount of sunshine
in winter, as stated on other sheets, for example, Melbourne and Hobart.
The angles of the sun’s ra/s are lowest in winter and therefore the length of the shadow cast is
greatest. This length taken in the direction of the sun’s rays, shown on diagrams as “ x,” is a factor to
be considered in the spacing apart of dwelling units, and determines the projection of verandahs, eaves
and hoods, etc., necessary to keep the sun off walls, doors, and window openings.
The length “ x ” can be determined from the height “ h ” and angles of the sun’s rays, and the
length of “ y ” at right-angles to the face of the building can be determined after “ x ” has been found.

PLANNING PRINCIPLES: DENSITY AND COVERAGE.
Ref. Pg. 2.
DENSITY is the number of dwelling units per acre. Multiplied by the number of persons in a
dwelling unit, which in Australia is approximately 3.7, this gives the number of persons per acre under
average conditions.
NET DENSITY is the number of dwelling units per acre over the actual area of the building sites
in any given development area.
GROSS DENSITY is the number of dwelling units per acre over the total area of a given
development, including the roads, parks and playgrounds.
Low densities are generally considered desirable for good living conditions. It is unreliable to
consider density over small areas without taking into account the surrounding area. For instance, a
very high net density per acre might be permissible under certain conditions over an area of less than an
acre, but over an area of several acres this density would need to be considerably reduced.
In some cases the type of dwelling unit to be erected will limit the density. For instance, much
higher densities are possible, though not necessarily desirable, if multi-storey dwelling units are planned
than if single dwelling units are to be used.
Some authorities prefer high density decentralised areas giving a medium or low gross density over
a large area, rather than an evenly distributed low or medium gross density over that total area.
Good planning and a high standard of maintenance are desirable in all cases, but are essential where
high densities are permitted. Under haphazard development and low standard of maintenance, high
densities are likely to lead rapidly to slum conditions.

DIAGRAMS SHOWING 1, 2 AND 3-STOREY UNITS WITH THE SAME NET DENSITY.
COVERAGE is the amount of a unit site or allotment covered by buildings. Low coverage is
generally considered desirable for good living conditions. Regulations and limits of coverage should
be based on scientific considerations, such as angles of the sun’s rays, light, and the areas of open spaces
required for parks and playgrounds.

INVESTIGATION OF CLIMATIC CONDITIONS FOR THE
CLASSIFICATION OF PLANNING ZONES.
(Especially relating to sub-tropical and tropical areas.)
It is considered that in determining the division of Australia into climatic zones for the purpose
of defining the basic requirements of housing the aim should be to reduce the number of zone types to a
minimum and thus simplify the drawing up of charts or large-scale maps indicating requirements.
To divide the country into zones determined by straight-out linear boundaries, such as lines o,
latitude, appears wrong, as the climatic conditions of areas so divided often vary considerably, even in
places only twenty or thirty miles apart ; it is therefore recommended that the approach be such that
the following climatic factors be taken into consideration :
(a) Temperature ;
(b) Humidity ;
(c) Rate of air movement ;
(d) Sunshine and latitude ;
(e) Direction of prevailing winds ;
(f) Rainfall, snow, etc.
It is considered that the most important of the factors which affect the problem of zoning are
temperature, humidity and rate of air movement, and these combine into one scale of measurement,
termed Effective Temperature, which indicates the apparent temperature felt by the human body.
Effective temperature is defined as the index of the degree of warmth or cold felt by the human
body in response to temperature, humidity and air movement. From tests made in the United States of
America with different effective temperatures, scales of physical comfort for both summer and winter
have been fixed. These range from 68°-75° E.T. for summer and from 63 -71 for winter conditions,
the range of humidity being from 30 per cent, to 60 per cent.
In general the effective temperature rises with an increase of dry bulb temperature, with an increase
in humidity, and drops with air velocity increase. It is thus seen that where temperature and humidity
are high it is imperative to provide efficient ventilation, and it also follows that the effective temperature
in a room poorly ventilated will tend to be higher than that outside.
It is realised that in many places the effective temperature will rise above the comfort level from
time to time. When this occurs continuously for more than three consecutive months in the year, it
is considered that particular attention should be directed to the relief of these conditions. It is therefore
suggested that two broad types of zone be determined according to the following conditions :
Zone A. —All areas where the effective temperature is above the comfort limit (/.e., above 75
E.T.) for more than, say, three months of the year, would be included in Zone A.
Zone B. —All areas where the effective temperature is within or below the comfort range for
more than, say, nine months of the year, would be included in Zone B.
These main zones could be subdivided as found necessary to satisfy special local conditions, e.g.,
sunshine and latitude, prevailing winds, rainfall, snow and any unusual combinations of temperature and
humidity ; and for each subdivision recommendations would be made in connection with matters such
as minimum amount of light area desirable, minimum ventilation areas for different aspects, special
protection against driving rain and insulation against cold.
To determine the zone classification of any particular place it would be necessary to draw up
effective temperature charts and graphs for each month of the year ; and for the sub-classifications,
charts and graphs of dry bulb temperature, humidity, wind, rainfall, and the manner in which these and
other local conditions combine, would be required.
In the normal dwelling it is impracticable, economically, to control humidity or to effect any
worth-while reduction of air temperature, but air movement can generally be partially, and easily,
controlled within the limits set by external conditions. In areas where the temperature and the humidity
are for the most part low, ventilation standards would be determined more from the health than the
comfort standpoint ; but where temperature and humidity are constantly high, it is obvious that provision
for relatively unimpeded air movement in the dwelling is of great importance.
It is recommended, therefore, that in Zone A the “ Open ” type of planning be adopted, and
that both “ Open ” and “ Compact ” planning, or a combination of the two, be used in Zone B.
“Open ’’ planning can be considered as that type of planning which allows all habitable rooms,
including the kitchen, to be opened to the fresh air in such a way as to allow as large an amount of air
as possible to circulate. In general this necessitates the design of the greater part of the building in a
one-room width with ample opening areas in the two opposite walls of each room. Compact planning
is that type of planning in which the rooms are placed in a close or more or less compact area, and in which
the provision of maximum cross ventilation is not a determining factor.
n general, the Open plan, the Compact plan, and combinations of the two, could be used to
advantage in Zone B ; but, in the sub-classifications of that zone recommendations would be made
setting out the relative advantages and disadvantages of each type for all sets of conditions.


SITE SELECTION.
A site is an area of land selected for Housing Development.
The relationship of sites for Housing Development to the industry, commerce, agriculture and
transport of the area is very important.
This relationship is a matter to be considered in a Town Plan and it should be pointed out that
lack of a satisfactory solution of this problem can affect the proper functioning of the entire area. If
this relationship has not been dealt with in a Town Plan, it should be considered under the heading of
Site Selection, in addition to the following factors :
Contours. —The contours of the land have a considerable bearing on its suitability for Housing
Development. Undulating land is generally desirable, and the levels should always permit simple and
economical road and dwelling unit design and construction. Contours should also permit satisfactory
drainage of the area.
Soil and Subsoil. —The type of subsoil is important and should be suitable for the foundations
necessary for roads and dwelling units.
The type of soil should be suitable for garden development.
Aspect and Prospect. —The aspect of the site is important, and should be such that satisfactory
planning is possible. In a site of reasonable size, the planning of the general layout will usually allow
the individual allotments and unit sites to obtain good aspects and conditions of sunlight generally.
Where land falls steeply to the south, winter sunlight may be partially obscured from allotments
or unit sites in that particular area.
Pleasant prospects are not always obtainable for all of the allotments and unit sites, but are a great
advantage if available for at least part of the development.
Trees. —Trees add greatly to the beauty and amenity of a Housing Development, and are therefore
to be considered an advantage on a site.
Care should be taken to see that the land is not too thickly timbered, because In this case additional
expense and time in clearing the site may be incurred.
Trees can also be of assistance as wind breaks.
Climatic Conditions. —Within the limits of each area zoned under a regional or town plan,
which will include sites for Housing Development, there is not likely to be much choice of site from the
consideration of climatic conditions, apart from winds. In parts of the country where high temperatures
and humidity exist for a considerable time of the year, the sites selected for Housing should be *is open
as possible to the prevailing winds. In other areas with lower temperatures, it may be better to select
sites protected from winds.
Utilities. —lt is important that Utilities, such as sewerage, water supply, electricity, etc., can be
supplied to the site. The levels, type of soil and other matters should be checked to see that the supply
oi these services will not be hindered.


PLANNING PRINCIPLES: LARGE AREAS.
Ref. P. 2A abc.
DIAGRAMS INDICATING DIFFERENT METHODS OF SUBDIVISION AND DEVELOPMENT OF A
LARGE AREA.
The Gridiron System.
(In which roads are laid out on a grid
or criss-cross plan.)
In the past the gridiron system of
planning was widely used over large
and small sites. The development was
generally applied indiscriminately as a
rigid standard plan regardless of varia-
tions in the conditions of particular
sites.
In some cases the result is good ;
more often the result is unsatisfactory.
€
On steeply sloping sites the grid
system, applied without considering
contours, results in too many steep
roads.
Because all roads are of equal width,
poor traffic control results. Roads and
service costs are higher than if the
roads were varied in width and con-
struction to suit their traffic load
Over sites with slight variation in
level, a well-designed grid system can
be planned to eliminate many of these
unsatisfactory features. Major roads
for high-speed traffic should be deter-
mined, the remaining roads reduced in
width and all road junctions planned,
according to the amount of traffic they
serve.
PLAN SHOWING THE GRIDIRONT SYSTEM
The Contour System.
(In which roads are laid out to suit the
levels of the site usually along con-
tour lines.)
This system is most suitable for un-
dulating sites and those with consider-
able variation in level.
The contour system layout is usually
varied and interesting. Full advantage
is taken of the levels of the site and the
view.
Roads over the site can be varied in
width and construction to suit the
traffic load in the areas served. The
length of road per dwelling unit over
the whole area is economical in con-
struction and design. Traffic control
is good ; through traffic is confined to
major roads. Junctions of major and
minor roads are carefully designed to
avoid congestion and reduce the num-
ber of accidents.
A careful study of each area is neces-
sary to ensure that the best solution is
reached. In a well-designed scheme
the amenities of the development are
increased greatly.
Roads should be laid out so that they
are not too steep or too curved, so
that traffic may flow easily.
PLAN SHOWING THE CONTOUR SYSTEM
IN MANY CASES THESE SYSTEMS CAN BE COMBINED WITH ADVANTAGE.


PLANNING PRINCIPLES: SMALL AREAS.
Ref. P. 2B oc.
Gridiron Road Subdivision.
In the majority of gridiron road sub-
divisions there is no separation of main
high speed traffic from access and ser-
vice traffic, and all roads throughout
the area are available for equal use by
all types of traffic; therefore the widths
and surfaces of all roads need to be the
same high standard as a major road.
There is no natural control of traffic
which would result from improved
planning of roads and road junctions
All allotments front on to major
roads and are of similar size and shape.
In this system of development the
standard of amenities to the neigh-
bourhood is generally not high.
Numerous examples of this gridiron
system can be seen in housing develop-
ments all over the Commonwealth.
PLAN SHOWING GRIDIRON ROADS
Turned Road Subdivision.
A turned road is one that makes a
loop on one or both sides of a road. If
this type of subdivision takes place on
both sides of a major road, as shown on
plan, the minor roads become continu-
ous turned roads. Turned roads are
intended for main access and service
access to allotments.
This system avoids the turning of
traffic necessary in cul-de-sacs and is
discouraging to through traffic.
Ail allotments front on to the turned
roads not on to the major road.
Some allotments vary in shape and
size but all are generally suitable for
building.
The turned roads can extend into
the site more deeply than shown on
plan, depending on the actual condi-
tions of each site.
The system generally is very flexible
and can be used to advantage in con-
junction with other systems.
The standard of amenities with this
type of subdivision generally is high,
and the length and cost of road per
allotment is low.
This method of subdivision was
adopted in the plans for the housing
development at Willow Run, Michigan,
U.S.A., because for the amenities re-
quired it was the most economical in
length and in cost per allotment.

Cul-de-sac Subdivision.
Cul-de-sacs are designed for ac-
cess to allotments of light traffic
only, therefore the width and con-
struction are those of minor roads
The main access and service ac-
cess to the allotments are both
from the same road.
All allotments front on to cul-
de-sacs not on to the major road.
This system of subdivision is
often used in conjunction with
other systems.
The length and width of cul-de-
sac can vary to suit actual condi-
tions of the site such as the design
of the subdivision and the traffic
roads.
Where the length of the cul-de-
sac is short, the traffic load is light
and therefore the width of road
narrow. A turning circle should
be planned at the end of the road.
Where the ends of cul-de-sacs
are near each other as shown on
plan, footpaths connecting them
should be provided for pedes-
trians.
LAN SHOWING CUL-DE-SAC ACCESS
Cul-de-sac Park Subdivision.
The roads are designed only for
service access to allotments there-
fore the width of roads and con-
struction can be that of service
roads. These roads are dished to
the centre with gulleys to storm-
water drains, thus obviating the
need for kerbs and gutters.
All services could be carried in
ducts at the sides of roads with
leads to rear of houses.
The allotments are all of similar
shape and size and a part of each
allotment forms a park for general
use.
The main access to the houses is
from the park, on to which all
houses front.
This system of subdivision pro-
vides many amenities, including a
pleasant outlook for all houses, a
park or playground for general
use, good service access to houses,
including garages where they are
required.
Road development and services
in the area are economical.
This system gives an increased
number of allotments to the acre,
and the park area could be main-
tained by the management of the
estate or by the council.

THIS SHEET INDICATES VARIATIONS OF THE SYSTEMS OF SUBDIVISION OF SMALL AREAS.
Subdivisions should be planned in such a way that allotments are within convenient distance of
passenger transport service. This distance shpuld not be more than a half mile.
In re-development schemes, many existing traffic routes may remain, the area between these
being available for re-planning. Therefore the length of cul-de-sacs, depth of turned roads and cul-de-sac
parks is limited.
Footpaths linking roads may often be used to advantage where additional roads are not required.
The distance between roads is usually the depth of two allotments. This may be varied to provide park
area, playgrounds or strips of open country between allotments or between subdivisions.
Cross roads very close together waste land. A reasonable spacing is between 12 and 20 allotments.
Where allotments extend continuously, the disadvantages of Ribbon Development appear, the roads
are used for general traffic and, therefore, the amenities decrease.
DIAGRAMS SHOWING VARIATIONS OF THE GRIDIRON SYSTEM OF SUBDIVISION.
This system is flexible as regards contours, aspect, and use with other systems. The cul-de-sac may
have secondary cul-de-sacs or turned roads branching off, providing the distance from the transport service
to the furthest allotment does not exceed a half mile.
DIAGRAMS SHOWING VARIATIONS OF THE CUL-DE-SAC SYSTEM OF SUBDIVISION.
This system can vary in depth and treatment to suit each site. Connecting roads and footpaths
may be desirable. Many variations with secondary turned roads or cul-de-sacs off the original turned
road are possible. The contours of the ground and the main drains affect the layout of the roads.
DIAGRAMS SHOWING VARIATIONS OF THE TURNED ROAD SYSTEM OF SUBDIVISION.
This type of plan can be served from one road only or extend between two roads. Development
with the cul-de-sac and turned road system is also possible, provided the distance for pedestrians to the
transport service does not exceed a half mile.

PLANNING PRINCIPLES: TYPES AND GROUPING
Ref. P. 3A.
THIS SHEET SETS OUT THE VARIOUS TYPES OF DWELLING UNITS, AND CERTAIN PRINCIPLES
CONCERNING THEIR USE IN HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS.
Single Dwelling Units are free standing dwelling
units, one or two storeys high, for one family, and can
be developed individually or by some form of group
ownership.
Attached Dwelling Units are grouped dwelling
units, usually not more than two storeys high, and in-
clude those generally known as semi-detached houses,
terrace houses, and those grouped in other ways. These
dwelling units may be on individual allotments or unit
sites, and may be developed individually or by some
form of group ownership.
Multi-Storey Dwelling Units are grouped dwelling
units, two or more storeys high on a unit site. These
dwelling units are more likely to be under some form
of group ownership than individual development.
Temporary Demountable Dwelling Units. —These dwelling units may be entire homes or
merely parts, such as rooms or verandahs. The standards of area are likely to be lower than for dwelling
units generally, but speed of manufacture and erection, and ability to be easily dismantled and re-erected
are of great importance. Individual development is unlikely as this form of Housing is permitted only
as a temporary expedient to satisfy an immediate need.
Principles concerning the use of the various types in Housing Developments. —As a
community is normally made up of persons of different age groups, sizes of family, living requirements
and interests generally, it is considered reasonable and desirable that this variation should exist and be
allowed for when new communities or groups are being planned. It is not considered good to have
large groups of any one type of dwelling unit exclusively.
It is likely that the majority of married couples with young children will prefer to live in single
dwelling units or attached dwelling units ; that married couples with no children or whose children
have grown up, may prefer multi-storey dwelling units ; and that single persons will prefer multi-storey
dwelling units or some form of hostel. The proportion of types for each particular housing development
will need to be found from a study of a survey of the needs of the people.
Apart from supplying different types of dwelling units as a social need, there are advantages to be
gained, as more interesting and varied layouts are possible if the types are different than if the whole
layout is of the same type. It is also possible to obtain higher density if the types are varied than if all
single dwelling units are planned, while still maintaining the same standards of solar planning as set out
on the General Sheets.
In new development areas it is possible to follow the principles set out above more readily than
in re-development areas where existing factors such as limited land area and the population to be re-
housed may restrict their use, and so prevent the best living conditions being obtained in the development.


PLANNING PRINCIPLES: UNIT SITE PLANNING
Ref. P. 4A o.
A UNIT SITE IS AN AREA OF LAND IN A SUBDIVISION WHICH IS INTENDED TO BE DEVELOPED
FOR MULTI-STOREY DWELLING UNITS.
The unit site can vary considerably in size, but must be sufficiently large to allow for the density
of dwelling units required, and the provision of adequate sunshine and light, privacy of sight and sound
o all dwelling units, and area for grouped services such as parking, garages, laundry, drying, etc., in
addition to space for gardens and play areas.
Unit Site Planning of Large Areas.
In planning unit sites for several blocks of dwelling units, various principles discussed under the
heading of site subdivision and development apply, such as the need for internal access roads to follow
the contours of the site for reasons of traffic, economy of services, etc.
The roads of the site should provide for access to the dwelling units only. It is undesirable for
any external traffic to pass through a unit site, though ready access to a major road is an asset.
In addition to the internal road layout for main and service access, the siting of the blocks for
solar planning and contours is usually the main requirement.
Compact-shaped sites are usually better for planning purposes than long, thin or other irregular
shapes, which allow much less variation in arrangement of blocks.
Minor road
Compact-shaped unit site permits variation in the
placing of blocks and access roads.
Minor road.
Irregular-shaped unit site limits the placing of
blocks for aspect, and the layout of access roads.
DIAGRAMS INDICATING VARIOUS ARRANGEMENTS OF ACCESS AND LAYOUT OF LARGE UNIT SITES.
Unit Site Planning of Single or Small Grouped Sites in Existing Developments.
These small single or grouped sites are usually vacant sites in a built-up area, and in these cases
the main factors controlling the planning will be in existence and cannot be altered to any great extent.
Where it is possible for any of these unit sites to be grouped and developed as a whole, this should
be done ; because generally the size of this type of unit site is not large enough to permit the building
blocks to be planned with sufficient variation to suit the aspect and view. Where small unit sites must
be developed individually, the requirements of sun and view can only be fulfilled by the internal planning
of the dwelling units.
Minor road.
'ndividual development is not
desirable and restricts direction
of blocks. Buildings are close
together, and conditions of sun-
light poor.

THIS SHEET ILLUSTRATES VARIOUS METHODS OF PLANNING BLOCKS OF MULTI-STOREY
DWELLING UNITS ON A UNIT SITE, BASED ON SOLAR PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS.
IT IS NECESSARY TO DECIDE WHICH DIRECTION OF BLOCKS GIVES THE BEST CONDITIONS OF
SUNLIGHT AND TO PLAN AS MANY DWELLING UNITS AS POSSIBLE IN THAT DIRECTION.
Various factors such as the size and the number of dwelling units to be provided, the type of access
within the blocks and the particular conditions of site and aspect will be important considerations in
deciding the shape of the blocks.
Solar planning considerations indicate that the straight narrow block is most suitable and economical
generally for the majority of unit sites with normal conditions of levels, access, etc. It will be appreciated
that many combinations of these blocks are possible, and that the unit site and proposed arrangement
should be analysed for the sunlight and ventilation obtainable in each case.

DIAGRAMS SHOWING THE RELATIVE DISTANCE REQUIRED BETWEEN MULTI-STOREY DWELLING UNIT
BLOCKS OF SIMILAR HEIGHT. FOR DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS OF THE MAIN AXIS OF THE BLOCKS.
The Main Axis from North to South.
The elevations facing east and west receive sunlight for
an equal number of hours during the day. This direction
is most suitable for blocks one dwelling unit in width,
where sunlight is required equally to both sides of the
blocks and also for blocks in which the dwelling units
are on either side of a central corridor.
The Main Axis from East to West.
The elevations facing north receive the maximum
amount of sunshine, while those facing south do not re-
ceive any in the winter months. This direction is most
suitable for blocks, one dwelling unit in width, where the
service rooms are on the south side, and should not be
used for blocks two units in width.
The Main Axis from North-east to South-west, and
from North-west to South-east.
The elevations facing north-east or north-west have
good conditions of sunlight, the first before noon, the
second after noon, but the other long elevations have poor
conditions.
These directions are therefore only suitable for blocks
one dwelling unit in width.


PLANNING PRINCIPLES: DENSITY AND COVERAGE
Ref. P. 4B o.
The maximum desirable limits of NET DENSITY for any particular development of multi-storey
dwelling units will generally be indicated by solar planning considerations, but other factors such as the
relation of the development to the housing of the district, must be considered and in some cases wiii
indicate that this maximum figure should be reduced. The type of plan within the block, whether one
or two dwelling units in width, whether for families or for single persons, will affect the density.
The DENSITY of any unit site must comply with the requirements of the plan of the district for
density and decentralisation generally.
Where it is desired to make use of existing facilities and services, such as water supply, sewerage,
etc., the maximum extension of these services may limit the density of the unit site.
The cost of land, and the cost of the building per dwelling unit, must usually be kept within certain
reasonable limits and in this way economic factors will have a bearing on the density of the site.
The GROSS DENSITY of an area of multi-storey dwelling units is very much lower than the NET
DENSITY, because it is necessary to provide area for roads, playgrounds and parks. There are various
methods of arriving at the area required for playgrounds and parks ; one, based on Coverage allows
10 per cent, of the total area, with a 4-acre minimum, and another based on Density, allows a
certain area per 1,000 persons housed, and recommendations vary between 4 and 7 acres. The latter
method should be followed. It will therefore be apparent that if the Net Density of an area is increased,
the population housed does not increase in the same proportion as additional open space should be
made available from the total area.
DIAGRAMS SHOWING AREAS OF DWELLING UNITS AND PLAY SPACE AT DIFFERENT NET DENSITIES.
The maximum desirable COVERAGE of multi-storey dwelling units on a unit site is indicated
by the requirements of solar planning. It is usually considered that a Coverage of 33 per cent, should
not be exceeded for good living conditions.
A problem to be decided in many cases is, whether for a given Density, it is better to increase
the number of storeys and reduce the Coverage, probably installing a lift service and increasing the relative
cost of the building, or to keep down the number of storeys and increase the Coverage, while eliminating
the lift service and reducing the relative building costs.
Relation of Storey Heights to Lift Services.
If multi-storey dwelling unit blocks are more
than 3 storeys high, it is generally considered that a
lift service should be provided. This service is a
relatively expensive item in the building and main-
tenance costs, and in order to reduce the cost per
dwelling unit as much as possible it is usually desir-
able that several additional storeys at least should be
incorporated in the building once the lift service is
considered necessary.
DIAGRAM SHOWING STOREY HEIGHTS AT WHICH
LIFT SERVICES ARE CONSIDERED NECESSARY.


Ref. P. 4B b.
This sheet indicates various considerations regarding DENSITY and COVERAGE for multi-storey
dwelling units based on solar planning principles and information set out on General Sheets. All dwelling
units should be sufficiently far apart for the windows to obtain sunlight at some period between 9 a.m.
and 3 p.m. in midwinter. The diagrams and analysis have been worked out for these conditions at Sydney
New South Wales.
Diagrams and Analysis showing the comparative Density, Coverage, Population and Distance
between ulti-story Dwelling Unit Blocks of different heights and aspect,
set out according to solar planning principles and based on the following assumptions :
Width of blocks 30 ft. Persons per d.u. ... 3.7
Storey height 10 ft. Area of d.u 900 sq. ft.
The calculations for Density and Coverage are based on the spacing of multi-storey dwelling unit blocks
according to solar planning principles, and related to one acre.
It is probable in practice that these conditions will vary greatly, and considerable variation can
be made in planning where required, to deal with any special conditions which may exist ; to reduce
the Coverage for instance, where this may be excessive. Gross Density has not been considered, as the
diagrams illustrate theoretical arrangements of dwelling unit blocks only, and are not intended to indicate
unit site plans.

From the diagrams and analysis it will be seen that the highest Net Density is possible where blocks
run in a north-south direction, and where blocks run in an east-west or diagonal direction the Net Density
will be lower. It will also be seen that the Net Density increases with the number of storeys but not in
the same proportion. It is considered by many authorities that for good living conditions generally,
such as privacy, garden development, etc., in blocks of multi-storey dwelling units, quite apart from solar
planning requirements, the Coverage should not exceed 33 per cent., and that the distance between blocks
should not be less than 80 feet.
It is apparent from the analysis that in some cases the Coverage and the distance between blocks
permitted by solar planning standards, do not comply with these recommendations and that adjustments
in planning will therefore be necessary.


PLANNING PRINCIPLES: UNIT SITE LAYOUT
Ref. P. AC a.
External Access of Multi-storey Dwelling Unit Blocks.
Access from the roads of the unit site to the multi-storey dwelling unit block must be provided
for main traffic, vehicular and pedestrian, and for service traffic, both for the building management and
for individual dwelling unit requirements.
The design of these access details will depend on the layout of the whole unit site, the relation of
the roads to the entrances of the blocks, and the actual arrangement of the dwelling units within the
block.
When the development is first being considered it may not be known whether a large proportion
of the traffic is likely to be pedestrian, or whether it will be necessary to provide garage and parking
facilities on a large scale. Provision should be made for the extension of these facilities at a later date
if required. '
Access from garage blocks to the dwelling unit blocks under cover is desirable.
In some layouts the same roads and access generally will serve for both main and service access,
but in other developments it may be considered desirable to provide separate service roads, parking areas
and entrances to blocks.
Where separate entrances for service traffic are to be provided, it is possible that paths to the main
entrances and vehicular access to the service entrances might be suitable, as well as economical, and
satisfactory in landscape treatment. These entrances might be planned in such a way that access from
garages and parking area to entrance halls and staircases could be used jointly for service and main access
in conjunction with paths for pedestrian access.
DIAGRAMS SHOWING VARIOUS ARRANGEMENTS OF ACCESS TO MULTI STOREY DWELLING UNIT BLOCKS
Internal Access of Multi-storey Dwelling Unit Blocks.
In some cases the service access is planned quite separately from the main access, and separate
service stairs, lifts and entrances to the dwelling units are provided. In other cases the main and service
access are combined partly or altogether ; the stairs may be used jointly for main and service access,
but separate entrances to blocks and to dwelling units may be provided. Consideration will need to be
given to the access generally, in order that adequate fire escapes may be provided.
A separate service entrance to dwelling units is usually considered desirable in order that food
fuel, laundry, etc., may be delivered conveniently and directly to the service area of the dwelling unit.
In small dwelling units for one or two people this service entrance is often eliminated. Where it is not
considered essential to have a separate service entrance to three-bedroom dwelling units, for instance,
it is important that the access to the service area should be carefully planned and be as direct as possible.
The actual arrangement of the dwelling units has an important bearing on the design of the access
and layout generally of the unit site, Some groupings permit only one particular type of access while
others offer alternatives.


Ref. P. 4C b.
THIS SHEET SHOWS VARIOUS WAYS OF GROUPING DWELLING UNITS AND THE ACCES
TO SERVE THEM.
The actual arrangement of the dwelling units has an important bearing on the design of the access
and layout generally of the unit site.
There are three main types of grouping, type A, in which small numbers of dwelling units are
entered from the stair hall directly serving them ; type B, in which numerous dwelling units are entered
from a balcony connecting staircases some distance apart ; and type C, in which numerous dwelling
units are entered from a central corridor connecting staircases some distance apart. Consideration
will need to be given to the access generally, in order that adequate fire escapes may be provided.
DIAGRAMS SHOWING TYPE (A) GROUPING AND ACCESS IN MULTI STOREY DWELLING UNITS
DIAGRAMS TYPE (A)
Access lifts and stairs are shared only between 2, 3 or 4-dwelling
units per floor. Separate service access is possible in (a) and (d), but
not in ( b ) and (c).
In blocks one dwelling unit in width good conditions of solar
planning are possible, but (b) and (c) are not as good as (a). In
blocks two dwelling units in width, good conditions of solar planning
are restricted by the aspect. Generally the access, whether com-
bined or separate is relatively uneconomical, and this type of group-
ing is not recommended for multi-storey dwelling units over three
storeys high.
DIAGRAMS SHOWING TYPE (B) GROUPING AND BALCONY ACCESS OF MULTI STOREY DWELLING UNITS
Access lifts and stairs are shared between numerous dwelling
units per floor. Separate service access generally is not possible, except
as shown in ( b ).
Blocks are one dwelling unit in width and allow good conditions
of solar planning, though the shadows cast by the balconies need to be
considered.
Where dwelling units each occupy part of two floors within the
block, it is possible to eliminate the balconies at alternate floors. This
reduces the amount of shadow cast and increases the privacy of the dwel-
ling units, though internal staircases are necessary.
This type of grouping is suitable and economical for multi-storey
dwelling units 3 or more storeys high.
DIAGRAMS TYPE (B)
DIAGRAMS SHOWING TYPE (C) GROUPING AND CORRIDOR ACCESS OF MULTI STOREY DWELLING UNITS
DIAGRAMS TYPE (C)
Access lifts and stairs are shared between numerous dwelling
units per floor. Service access, completely separate from main access
is not possible, though separate lifts and stairs for service access can
be provided.
Blocks are two dwelling units in width and do not allow good
conditions of solar planning in most cases.
This type of plan can be used for dwelling units each occupying
part of two floors within the block, and corridors on alternate floors
can be eliminated.
This type of grouping is suitable and economical for multi-
storey dwelling units 3 or more storeys high.


PLANNING PRINCIPLES: ALLOTMENT PLANNING
Ref. P. 6A.
FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS SHEET AN ALLOTMENT IS AN AREA OF LAND IN A
SUBDIVISION WHICH IS INTENDED TO BE DEVELOPED FOR A SINGLE DWELLING UNIT.
The size of the allotments for single dwelling units will depend on the net density, and must be large
enough for the dwelling unit, which will vary in size and shape. Before the development is decided the
type of dwelling unit to be built must be considered. The size of the allotments must allow space between
dwelling units for adequate sunshine and light, privacy of sight and sound, access and area for drying, play
and garden.
A dimension of 50 feet at the building line is generally considered a minimum width to fulfil these
requirements, which will vary with the width and shape of the dwelling unit. Where possible wider
allotments are desirable. Wide, shallow allotments are preferable to narrow, deep allotments of similar
area.

Generally, allotments should be planned at right-angles to roads and on radii where the roads are
curved. In the Gridiron System the subdivision is usually regular with similar-sized and shaped allotments.
This method gives the maximum number of allotments of a given size. Usually, allotments are designed
to front on to the four sides of a subdivision. It is more desirable, however, that they should be planned
so that the length of all allotments is in that direction which gives the best conditions of sunlight.
Allotments at an acute angle to roads are unsatisfactory, and should be avoided in planning where possible.
DIAGRAMS SHOWING DIFFERENT WAYS OF PLANNING ALLOTMENTS IN A SUB-DIVISION
In the Contour system the subdivision is usually irregular, with allotments of different size and
shape. Providing the areas are approximately similar and there is adequate space for the dwelling unit
and the amenities mentioned above, the variation in frontage and depth is unimportant. Where the
frontage is very narrow the dwelling unit will need to be set back from the frontage until the width of
the allotment is approximately 50 feet. In this system allotments seldom have quite the same aspect
and therefore need a little more space to enable the best conditions of sunlight to be obtained by planning.
DIAGRAMS SHOWING VARIOUS SHAPED ALLOTMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY EQUAL AREA
Where dwelling units are two rooms in
width, the long axis of the building should run in
a north-south direction in order to obtain the
greatest length of wall surface in sunlight under
winter conditions.

PLANNING PRINCIPLES: DENSITY AND COVERAGE
Ref. P. 68.
Density and Coverage. —Solar planning principles should be an important consideration in
deciding the Density and Coverage of single dwelling units, when planning the layout of a housing scheme,
although these principles will not always be the controlling factor. In some cases of planning by these
principles, though the conditions of sunlight and ventilation are good, the dimensions of the allotment
do not allow sufficient area for the garden, drying, play and access space required. In these cases the
size of the allotment needs to be decided by the actual area requirements rather than conditions of sunlight
and ventilation of the dwelling unit.
The diagrams and figures on this sheet are based on solar planning principles and information as
set out on General Sheets for Sydney, New South Wales. All dwelling units should be sufficiently far apart
for the windows to obtain sunlight at some period between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. in midwinter. The standards
of Density and Coverage according to these principles will vary in each State, and according to the aspect
of the allotments.

It will be seen that the Net Density in all cases is comparatively low and that good living conditions
are therefore possible, providing the Coverage is also reasonably low and that adequate parks and
playgrounds give a correspondingly low Gross Density.
In order that the largest size dwelling unit can be built on any allotment, and that extensions to
smaller dwelling units can be made as the size of the family increases, without exceeding the recommended
maximum Coverage, it is considered that allotments should be sufficiently large to take the maximum
size dwelling unit.
The following diagrams and analysis show the maximum Coverage with maximum sized dwelling
units of 1,500 sq. ft., for allotments running north-south, 40, 45 and 50 feet wide, and 80, 90 and 100 feet
deep respectively.

It is therefore recommended that 33 per cent, is the maximum Coveragethatshouid be allowed.
Under these conditions of maximum sized dwelling units, an area of approximately 1,500 sq. ft. is available
for garden space at the rear of the dwelling unit, which is considered adequate.
It should be noted that even with this maximum figure, each allotment should be considered
individually, as in some cases owing to uneven levels, difficult access, etc., the Coverage should be further
reduced.


PLANNING PRINCIPLES: ALLOTMENT LAYOUT
Ref. P. 6C.
The position of the dwelling unit on the allotment needs careful consideration. The distance
from adjacent dwelling units will be indicated by the amount of sunshine required, and the needs of
privacy, access, etc. In some cases the requirements of solar planning will indicate the distance the
dwelling unit should be set back from the frontage, but usually this distance is governed by the needs of
privacy and the general layout of the allotment.
Access from the road to the main entrance and the service entrance must be provided, and
provision should be made for garage access at a later date, if not included in the scheme originally. The
type of subdivision will indicate whether the service and garage entrances are from the rear or the front
of the allotment. Generally, access should be as direct as possible, and gates and paving reduced to a
minimum. Access from the garage to the dwelling unit under cover'is desirable.
Access from the dwelling unit to the garden from the living room or verandah is often desirable.
Access from the laundry to the drying ground is necessary, and is usually combined with the service entry.
It is convenient if the drying ground is near the laundry, and placed to catch the prevailing winds. It
should be screened as much as possible from the road and from the adjoining dwelling units.

The planting of trees and shrubs is desirable for amenity, privacy and protection from sun and
wind. Deciduous trees can be used with advantage to screen the sun in summer. If evergreen trees
are planted it will be necessary to study the angles of the winter sun. The planting of unsuitable trees can
cause considerable damage to foundations, paths and pipes. Trees and shrubs are often useful as
breakwinds, but care should be taken not to blanket the prevailing breeze where it is necessary.
The treatment of fences and boundaries can vary considerably. The elimination of all front
fences, so that a continuous lawn treatment can be carried up to the front wall of the dwelling unit adds
considerably to the beauty of the housing scheme.


PLANNING PRINCIPLES: DESIGN POINTS
Ref. P. 6D.
The Various Areas of a Dwelling Unit.
Dwelling units are composed of three main areas, the living area, the service area, and the sleeping
area. When relating the areas, the aim should be to allow as little passage space as possible, consistent
with good arrangement of the rooms for aspect, privacy and health.
Areas can be quite separate, but in small dwelling units are usually very closely linked ; particularly
the service and living areas, because the space for meals often forms part of the living area, and needs to
be very close for convenient access.
The bedrooms and bathroom should form a separate area ; the relation of the bathroom to the
plumbing of the service area is important for economy in construction.
Standardisation of each of the areas, which should then be related to suit the aspect of the site,
is a method of standard planning.

The Access of a Dwelling Unit.
The Main Access. —Main access to the dwelling unit can be either direct to the living room, or to
an entrance hall. Where the access is direct to the living room, some screen is necessary for privacy and
to prevent draughts. A piece of furniture, coat cupboard, or bookcase, or a curtain may be used. It is
usually possible and desirable to make the living room larger, if no entrance hall is required.

The Service Access.— Service access to the dwelling unit can be arranged in various ways, directly
to kitchen, from a porch serving kitchen and laundry, or through the laundry to the kitchen.
Access direct to the kitchen is not desirable in a small room because the external door takes up
valuable wall space, and it is difficult to protect the stove from draughts. Access from a covered porch
serving both kitchen and laundry is generally the best arrangement. It gives protection from weather,
but takes more floor area. Access through the laundry is not as good as from a porch, but if carefully
planned with doors to screen the tubs, this arrangement is quite satisfactory.

Internal Access.-The access between areas can be direct from one to another or by lobbies or
passages It is generally desirable that the bedrooms should open off a lobby, though in some cases a
bedroom opening from the living room is not objectionable. The bathroom and W.C. shouM mal cases
open off a k>bby ? or passage. Access to the kitchen without going through the living room is desirable
but not essential.
Garden Access.-Access to the garden is usually desirable from the living area or from a verandah.


COMMERCIAL CENTRE AND ALLIED RESIDENTIAL UNITS
National and regional planning to ensure the correct and fullest use of the land and all natural
resources of the country is necessary before towns and communities can be planned satisfactorily. Before
any regional planning can be done, a complete survey of all conditions should be made.
It is necessary that the plan of the community should dovetail into the regional plan and existing
communities should prepare surveys to assist in the development of their own area and also to provide
data for the Regional Survey.
As in most cases the surveys are not yet complete, the Commission wishes only to offer suggestions
about how a town may be planned, in the hope that the various town planning principles illustrated may
help communities facing a similar problem in their own area.
The Master Plan. —Although there are different opinions among planners on the details of a
town plan, it is generally agreed that each community should have a Master Plan for long range development.
This Master Plan should lay down the broad lines or skeleton of the plan, indicating the position of the
main areas and special features. The plan should not be regarded as fixed or final, but should be as flexible
as possible and subject to revision to satisfy changing conditions.
Diagram T.P. I shows the plan of a town comprising five neighbourhood units of from 2,000 to
3,000 people, each complete in itself for all the ordinary requirements of life, with its community centre
of shopping, educational, health and social facilities.
These units are grouped to form a town of approximately 10,000 to 15,000 people, with the
additional facilities required for a town of this size. In this greater area are secondary industries, business,
administration and community centres of a larger and more varied nature. A fairly compact group is
thus formed, surrounded by unbuilt-on land, some of which is utilised for farm and dairy produce to
supply the town with fresh perishable foodstuffs, and other areas are developed for an airport, racecourse
and other sporting activities. Some of the surrounding area should be left in its natural state, or planted
with forests.
It may be assumed that the town has been planned to suit the plan of the region generally, and as
part of the transport scheme it is served by a railway for passenger and goods traffic, and a high speed
road. Both these routes serve industry and passengers conveniently, but do not pass through the town.
Intersections between roads are carefully planned junctions, designed according to the levels of the adjacent
land and the amount of traffic to be served.
Industrial areas are carefully placed, adjacent to yet separated from the residential areas and in
close relation to the transport facilities. The layout of the whole plan visualises the need for the close
relationship of residential and working areas, so related that any undesirable working environment can
be screened from the other areas of the town.
Where possible areas of natural beauty and interest should be used to the fullest advantage in
residential or open park areas. Additional planting may be necessary and such places as the airport,
golf links, and racecourse can be developed in this way to provide interesting features in a landscape where
few exist.
It will be seen that it is possible to develop the plan gradually, as the need arises, until the five
community units are completed. The town should not be allowed to become any larger than is originally
planned, because the area allocated for open space is likely to be reduced and the services overtaxed.

This plan demonstrates the advantages of planned development. The residential areas are suitably
located in relation to places of work, recreation, commerce and transport. It also indicates the necessity
of zoning and the proper relationship of the countryside to the town area, thereby avoiding the spreading
of industry and housing beyond their planned limits. Definite limitation of size (area and population)
is regarded as a fundamental planning factor.

The relationship of housing to other components, such as education, industry, commerce, transpoit,
recreation, etc., is indicated on this plan. In the past the growth of towns and cities has not taken this
into account.
The residential unit is planned with a centre for child activities as a focal point. There are no
dwelling units with a frontage to high speed or major roads. The high speed road by-passes the
commercial centre and railway station, yet easy traffic access to either is provided.
