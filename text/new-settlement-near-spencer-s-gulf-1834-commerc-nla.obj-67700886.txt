Lord Chancellor should have said that no barrister ought
to have recommended an appeal to the house in this par-
ticular case, when the noble and learned lord himself had
formerly recommended it. He was standing by at the
time when this was said, and he went away with the im-
pression, and no other impression, that such was the fact ;
nor had he ever heard a solution of the matter until this
day. If the learned counsel did not mean that which
his words imported, and that which he (Lord Radnor)
heard, then his statement could have had no meaning
whatsoever.
The Doke of WELLINGTON conceived that tiie
question before the house was, whether a certain person
should be ordered to attend at the bar of the house to
answer for a breach of privilege which he had committed.
(Hear.) The observations made by the learned counsel
respecting the conduct of the noble and learned lord had
nothing whatever to do with the case. Supposing it was
tree that the noble and learned lord had advised that an
appeal should be made, whether it was true or false, still
he did not see what they hat! to do with it. It was no
libei on the noble and learned lord to say, that at the bar
he advised an appeal of which, when he had formed a more
mature judgment, he could not approve. (Hear, hear.)
He might have thought proper to animadvert upon the
appeal and to affirm it with costs, although he had*, when
a barrister and in a situation essentially different, advised
that very appeal. He was not aware that the solicitors or
the learned counsel had at all libelled the noble and learn-
ed lord, or that what they had stated was at ail a breach
of the privileges of that house. It was no breach of pri-
vilege to condemn the course adopted by the noble and
learned lord, provided ti at it was done in proper language,
and tbat ihe remarks toe temperate. There could be no

FINSBURY ELECTION.
Friday was the day fixed for the nomination of candi-
dates for the representation of this borough. At twelve
o?clock, Islington-green, the place appointed, presented a
Tory animated scene. Notwithstanding the rain, a consider-
able number of people had assembled, the supporters of the
different candidates being distinguished by their respective
banners, and bands of music gave in addition a cheerfulness
and liveliness to the assemblage.
Mr. Buncombe first appeared on the hustings, and was re-
ceived with a mixture of cheers and hisses; Mr. Wakley
soon followed, and was greeted with immense cheering.
The preliminary forms having been gone through,
William Ward, Esq. stood forward, and in a neat speech
proposed Mr. Pownall as a tit and proper person to represent
the borough of Finsbury in parliament. Mr. L, Haslope
(the leading member, we understand, amongst the Wesleyan
Methodists in this borough), seconded Mr. Ward?s nomi-
nation.
Mr. Babbage was proposed by Mr. F. O. Martin, and se-
conded by Mr, A. Stevenson.
Mr. Buncombe was proposed by Mr. H. Hewitt, and se-
conded by Mr. B. J. Armstrong.
Mr. George Rogers proposed Mr. Wakley, and Mr. H.
Smith seconded the nomination.
Mr. H. Pownall said that, in presenting himself to their
notice to represent the borough of Finsbury, he had much
pleasure in an opportunity of stating the grounds upon which
he sought that honour, as a sincere and attached member of
the Establishment and lover of the institutions of his country.
The union of the Church with the state he held to be part of
that constitution which had shed a lustre around the name of
England, and in the support of which he trusted to have their
suffrages at that election. He loved the Church, not only for
its principles, but for the benefits which it had and was daily
conferring upon the poorer classes of the community. He

COURT OF CHANCERY, Juke 28.
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL V. SHORE.
The hearing of this appeal was resumed this morning
before the Lord Chancellor, assisted by Mr. Justice Lit-
tledale, and Mr. Baron Park,
Mr. Knight was proceeding to read further evidence,
for the purpose of proving that the defendants were per-
sons professing the opinions commonly known hy the
name of Unitarian, when their counsel, at the suggestion
of the Lord Chancellor, consented to admit all that the
evidence went to establish. The learned gentleman then
addressed the court on the same side with Sir E. Sugden,
and contended that the whole question, notwithstanding
all the fuss made about it, lay in a very narrow compass.
The simple points to be determined were, whether Lady
Hewley did or did not hold opinions such as those sec-
tarians of that denomination. To establish the first ot
these, it was only necessary to refer to the fact that the
teaching or preaching of UnitarianEm was, in the time
of Lady Hewley, expressly prohibited by law, while it
was proved that the chapel of St. Saviour Gate, which
she erected and endowed, was one of those licensed under
the Act of Uniformity. In addition to this, which was
in itself conclusive, they had the express direction in the
rules for the government of the almshouses, that the
catechism of Bowles?a perfect Trinitarian catechism ?
was to be constantly used.
The Lord Chancellor said that Bowles?s catechism was
no such thing as a pure Trinitarian catechism. The
direction to use it proved nothing. The Presbyterians
used it, and the Unitarians used it, because, without the
morning, and doing other things which gave rise to sus-
picion. Whenever the defendant went into the plaintiff?s
house in his absence, the blinds were pulled down, and
Mrs. Dayman and he were on one occasion seen in the
back sitting room together. The rumours concurrent on
these observations naturally excited the suspicions of the
plaintiff, and domestic differences were the consequence.
Mrs. Hayrnan was confined in the year 1833, and three
or four hours after the accouchement had taken place,
the defendant was introduced by a Mrs. Jackj-on, �,
friend of Mrs. Hayrnan, into her bed room, and was
seen by the nurse to kiss both her and the child. He
was also seen by the doctor on another occasion in the
room, from which be rushed abruptly, excusing himself
for being there, as being an old married man. Mrs.
Haymau afterwards removed to Deal, and while there a
letter was sent to her by the defendant, which came into
her husband?s hands, and was couched in the warmest
terms, viz., ? May God*bless my own, my dearest, dear-
est, dearest Sarah ; write all, and fear not.? The plaintiff
and his wife afterwards took a house in Portiand-road,
Clapham, and the defendant continued his visits without
the plaintiff?s knowledge. From all these suspicious cir-
cumstances, it was contended that an adulterous inter-
course had taken place.
Mr. Sergeant Talfourd addressed the jury for the de-
fendant, and submitted that this was a mere case of con-
jecture, and by no means founded on proof sufficient to
support a case of this description. The principal witness
of the intercourse, if any had taken place, the maid ser-
vant, had not been called ; she might have proved having
smoothed the rumpled sofa or the disordered bed ; but
instead of calling her, the plaintiff had contented himself
with trusting to toe bickerings and the fancies of a few
inquisitive neighbours.
The Chief Justice summed up, and the jury returned a
verdict for the plaintiff?Damages 1001.
COURT OF EXCHEQUER, GRAY?S INN HALL,
June 28.
(Sittings in Equity before the Lord Chief Baron).
SMALL V. ATX WOOD.
The arguments in this case, which was part heard on
a former day, were concluded this morning. It was a
plea put in hy the defendant to the supplemental bill filed
by the plaintiffs, in which the defendant slated, after
denying ail the matters contained in the same bill, u that
he had been informed and believed that one of the plain-
tiffs, Francis Bailey, did some time in or about the year
1828, absolutely sell and dispose of and transfer to some
person or persons unknown to this defendant, all his, the
said plaintiff?s share, right, and interest, in the partner-
ship or company in the said bill mentioned, and therein
called the British Iron Company, and did atand from that
time cease to be a proprietor or member of such company,
and was thenceforth acquitted and discharged from all
obligations in respect of his having been a member of such
company, and did from such time cease to have any right,
tide, or interest, either at law or in equity of, in, or to the
property or effects of such company, and did from the same
time cease to hav eany right, title, or interest, in any of the
matters, the subject of, or mentioned in the original bill
of complaint in this supplemental bill mentioned, and that
the said Francis Bailey, at the lime of filing the supple-
mental bill, was not a proprietor or member of the said
company, or in any way interested therein, or liable in re-
gard thereto, or in any of the matters of such supple-
mental bill mentioned, all which matters this defendant
does aver to he true, and does plead in part to all the dis-
covery and relief sought by the said bill against this de-
fendant, and humbly v-omauds judgment whether he ought
to be compelled to make any further or other answer to
the same supplemental bill, and humbly hopes to he dis-
missed with his reasonable costs in this behalf sustained,?
Sir Edward Sugden, with whom were Mr. D. Wake-
field and Mr. Lovatt, appeared in support of the plea, and
contended that Mr. Bailey had no right to appear in the
character of plaintiff upon the supplemental bill, as at the
time the bid was filed he did not possess any interest in
respect of which the bill was filed. He had ceased to be a
proprietor of any shares in the company, and had abso-
lutely disposed of his interests in it in the year 1828.
The only point at large to be considered was, whether it
was possible to maintain this bill filed by persons repre-
senting themselves as having an interest in the matter,
when it appeared that such interest had ceased before the
filing of the bill. He would refer to the decision in the
case of the ? King of Spain v. Machado,? in 4th Russell,
in which the King of Spain and others filed their bill, and
when it was held that the Dons who were joined with the
King had no interest in the, case, the court decided that
it .v,*s but justice to allow the demurrer. The court, in
giving jadga-iei.it,. in the case, had referred to another case
of Cuff v. UlatjeffA' i.. The same volume of Russell,
p, 242, and to u Makepeace v. II ay thorn,? in p 244,
where it was held that if one party having an interest
?joins with another party who has no interest, the plea
must be allowed, and there could he no doubt but that
this was tb.e rule of law. Suppose the point, as stated
in the case of ? Cholmondeiey v. Chuton? arose, and all
she parties to this case should die away except Mr. Bailey,
what then would become of the suit? Such a pro**
ceeding, if allowed, must lead 30 mischief. He did not
think it necessary to make any further observations to
satisfy his lordship that the present plea ought to be
allowed.
Mr, Knight, with whom were Mr. Wigram and Mr.
Sharpe, appeared for the plaintiffs, and said that the pre-
sent plea was a singular one. It alleged that in or about
the year 1828, Mr. Bailey had assigned over his interest
to some person unknown to the defendant. The court
would recollect that the original hill was fined in the
year 1826, and the decree was not pronounced until
af er the year 1828; this, therefore, Avas an allegation
that after the original suit was instituted, a person, who
then had an interest, parted with it by way of assign-
ment, and therefore remained an improper party upon the
record. The dates would show that, if an improper
party now, he was equally so when tiie decree Avas pro-
nounced; and here there Avas nothing alleged of any
recent discovery. The decree, of course, must he
considered as valid at present; and it gave Francis Bailey
and others the relief Avhich it was thought proper to ad-
minister by that deerte. Francis Bailey, feeing a party to
that bill, was liable to the costs of the suit, subject to the
rights of indemnity as against Mr. Attwood. Me was
also liable to all undertakings as to costs, which Avere to
be borne by the plaintiffs. The decree of that court de-
clared certain contracts void, and directed accounts to be
taken, on the one hand, of the sums paid hy the com-
pany, with interest ; and on the other hand, of the rents
and profits received by the company ; and no one would
question the liability of Mr. Bailey with respect to these
accounts.
Sir E. Sugden objected to the decree being read. A
party in a plea or demurrer must take the record as he
found it, and must not travel beyond it ; and the only
question was whether, on the record as it stood, this Avas
a good plea ?
Mr. Knight said that the court could not keep from
itself a knowledge of its own acts. This was a decree
of the same court, in the same cause ; and to
say that it was not to be read, was stating some-
thing which he had never urged before. He be-
lieved, however, that it Avas not necessary to enter
into the consideration of this question ; for they had esta-
blished most clearly all that he wanted in their statement
?namely, the fact of possession, which would of necessity
render the plaintiffs liable to account; for nobody could
foresee hoAV those accounts would turn; and if they
should turn in favour of Mr. Attwood, then, as one of
tb.e original plaintiffs, Mr. Bailey bad no interest in
proving an item of these accounts, but did not his liability
create an interest ? He would refer to the case of Mr.
Martiueau, the solicitor, in this suit, who was a share-
holder at the time of the contract; but before the bill was
filed be had assigned over all his shares, had received a
contract of indemnity, and sho wed that hy the constitution
of the partnership, a party so retiring was indemnified
from all liability to contributions. His lordship, never-
theless, had decided that Mr. Martiueau was liable for
those contracts which the bill sought to set aside, and Mr.
Martineau?s evidence was, in consequence, excluded from
this cause.
Lord Lyndhurst.?A plaintiff cannot get out of a suit
bv assigning his interest pending his suit. Ido not sup-
pose that Mr. Wakefield will contend for this.
Mr. Wakefield?l do not contend for any thing so
wild.
Lord Lyndhurst.?lf the plaintiff was properly on the
record in the first instance, he would continue so till the
end. In this case he Avas properly on in the first instance,
and continued so during the progress of the suit.
Mr. Knight said that the plaintiff still continued so,
because the suit Avas still in the Master?d Office. The
learned counsel then referred to the cases of ? Garth v.
Ward,? in 2 Atkins, and the ?Bishop of Winchester v.
Payne,? and said that he thought he had proved to the
satisfaction of the court that, even if Bailey might have
assigned over his shares, yet he was still there for the pur-
poses of the suit ; and should his lordship decide for the
plea, be would, of course, allow the plaintiffs to amend
their bill. It Avould only create unnecessary expense and
delay, and in the end lead to nothing. For these reasons
he hoped his lordship would dismiss the plea.
Sir E. Sugden replied.
what book he was reading, and familiarly took bold of his
arm. She presently told him she was in great distress of
mind because her friends were going to send her to
Chelmsford, and she would rather stay with him if he
could take her home, and to this proposal he agreed.
Mr. Alderman Venables said the young man was
doubtless liable to punishment, but suggested to the
friends of the girl, that instead of pursuing that course,
it would be better to send her to her relatives at Amster-
dam, as she had expressed her willingness to go there.
She might in another country outlive her shame.
The friends acquiesced in the propriety of the advice,
aud both partes were then discharged.
COURT OF COMMON COUNCIL. fi,
On Friday a court was held specially to consider the report se ,
of the committee in relation to the election of aldermen.
Deputy Wood rose, and,lifter some prefatory remarks, pro- ,
posed a resolution to the following effect:?? That the Court c
of Aldermen is, in cases of appeal, and in questions between or
party and party, and other matters of a public nature, an tb
open* court; but matters of police, and those appertaining to nc
the conservative jurisdiction, are, in that court, discussed lei
and disposed of in private. m
Mr. Williams (of Watling-strcet) objected to the resolu. p,.
tion. The character of the Court of Aldermen would, he
stated, he greatly advanced in the public estimation if the
doors were thrown open. It was obvious thqt every right
exercised by that court ought to be exercised for the benefit
of the citizens of London ; but, in consequence of the existing
practices, very strong suspicions attached to the body, there
being something about secret agency not by any means recon- .
cilable with the general ideas of justice. In order to place ?
them on the highest pinnacle of public estimation, he should ,
move an amendment, ? That the Court of Aldermen should f
conduct their business in public, except that part Avhich, re-
lating to the preservation of the public peace and the pre- ,
rention and detection of crime, it may be necessary to * .
conduct in private.?
The Lord Mayor said, it A\-ould be advisable in the bon.
member to move the amendment as a recommendation of the
court, as he (tlie Lord Mayor) could not think fora moment a
of putting a resolution which purported to command the su- Wi
perior court. (Hear,'hear.) it
Mr. Williams said he had not the least objection to adopt jjj
the suggestion of his lordship as he was disposed to treat the q'j
Court of Aldermen with all due respect. ch
Mr. Stacey seconded the amendment. sit
Mr. Dixon opposed the amendment. The Court of Alder- an
men were, he said, by far the best judges whether it would or Wi
Avould not be advisable to throw open their court to the pub- Rg
lie. Whatever might be the preferable course, the' Court of 1
Common Council had no right to interfere (hear, hear), and vo
in adopting the present line of proceeding they were com- da
mining a legal violation. He believed that publicity would i >o
lesson the dignity of the Court of Aldermen. a t
Aid. Sir Petei Laurie said that he should certainly vote bei
for the amendment. (Cheers.) He was most desirous that bei
every thing should be public in the court iu which he had the
honour to hold a seat. wi
Aid. Brown said that he should conscientiously perform tin
his duty, Avithout looking for a moment to public opinion. wf
(Cheers). He could not for a moment see on what principle p a
Sir P. Laurie could think of voting for the amendment, in
preference to the original motion. He upon all occasions D]
acted according to the dictates of his conscience, and he dis-
claimed all acknowledgment of the right of the Court of
Common Council to interfere Avith the regulations of the wt
court to which ho had the honour to belong. is
Mr. E. Taylor said that he approved of the amendment. du
Mr. Richard Taylor said that the declaratory motion of ah
Deputy Wood was a tissue of false facts, unsupported by an liy
atom of the dominatory evidence. He wished to know Avhat th
the meaning of ?conservative jurisdiction? Avas ? Was it tAv

The Lord Mayor.?The Court of Aldermen are responsible ex
to the Court of King?s Bench if there is any thing illegal or di:
improper in their proceedings. in
Mr. Taylor conscientiously believed that if the aldermen or
discussed in public, all complaints against them would ter- w
minate. But he must say that, in all his researches, he eh
could not find testimony of the existence of such a thing as a w;
Com t of Aldermen, th
The Lord Mayor.?Perhaps you?ll look at the summons dc
of this day. The fact is, that Avithout a Court of Aldermen iu
you can?t have a Court of Common Council. ui
Mr. Williams?s amendment Avas then put and carried ; the iu
amendment was then proposed as an original motion, and th
Deputy Wood moved the following amendment:?? That ot
the Court of Aldermen, as the executive government of the ot
City, requires a degree of privacy, the extent of which must ft,
be discretionary Avith the members of that court, hut in all ci
cases where the public safety Avill permit, the utmost publi-
city should be given to the proceedings of that court, as the oi
best, if not the only means of securing popular approbation j, f
and general confidence.?
Alderman Copeland said that there did not exist a morel
honourable body chan the Court of Aldermen, und the court
u i� thrown open whenever any thing which interested ilir c
public took place.
Sir Peter Laurie.?Not at all. The public are interested s
in ?every thing. (Cheers.) I never said otherwise than that si
the doors of the court should he thrown open. t
After a few words from Mr. Galloway and Mr. Peacock, j,
Mr. Williams?s motion was agreed to, and the court ad- y
journed. ______
Amongst the proprietors of East India Stock, and others
connected Avith India affairs, a considerable degree of atten-
tion has been excited by the placing of Mr. Serjeant Spankie?s
opinion upon the table relative to the controlling power of
; the Court of Proprietors Avith regard to the granting of pen-
sions above the amount of COOL, as compensation to any
class of the company?s present and late servants, for tne
blight their prospects have sustained in the cession of the com-
pany?s monopoly. Very voluminous extracts from the many
acts referring to the company?s late charter were laid before
the learned seijeant. He appears, however?and we conceive
most properly?to have confined himself merely to the inter-
pretation of the 3d and 4th of William IV., c. 7, clause 88,
which distinctly provides for the compensation of all the com-
pany?s servants, be they of what class they may, who may
suffer by the abrogation of their monopoly, wherein the
power is vested for such purposes solely in the direction,
subject only to the Board of Control, and the gist of this
opinion turns in conclusion more strongly upon the fact, that
all future pensions and compensations must be payable out of
funds now transferred to the croAvn, and, of course, over
which the Court of Proprietors can have no control.?

Mr. Ellis speaks of a Chiaese philosopher, who, in writing

their women, and the consequent unamiableness of wives,
exhorts husbands not to desist from instructing them ; for,

he at least held the intellectual character of the sex,? ? even

to tread a mill?rats may be taught to run round a

A Female Demagogue?We have often heard of female
preachers, but seldom or never have known one of the gen-
tler sex take up the part of a political agitator. The office ot
democratical delegate, and of those emissariesi Avho so patrioti-
cally undertake to open the eyes of the public to a first per-
ception of their miseries?untelt perhaps before, ?seems to be
�uch a thriving and comfortable profession, that it has been
at length followed by a female. One of this sex and class has
succeeded considerably in the benevolent Avork ot persuading
the people about Dunning and other villages in this county
that they are alike wretched and oppressed, and that all this
wretchedness and oppression arise from tyranny and misgo-
vernment; but she has extracted pretty substantial proof that
their oppressors have still left them something to spare for
purposes which, suit their own whim. The people have
ssvalloAved her orations as ? proof of holy vyrit,? and con-
tributed largely to her support. ? Perth Courier.
New Locomotive Machine.?Mr. Akrill, a Aery in-
genious mechanic of Boston, has discovered a mode by Avhich
a person may easily propel himself on common roads, at a
speed of from eight to ten miles per hour, without any expen r
diture in material, save the cost of the carriage ! r i he con-
struction of the vehicle is remarkably light; the body is on
four wheels, and the impetus is effected by the pressure of the
feet upon some concealed machinery, the nature of which the
proprietor keeps a secret, though he Avillingly shows the car-
riage to every one except professed mechanics. At an eleva-
tion of about four feet the conductor sits, and he is enabled
to guide it Avith the utmost accuracy; to suspend the motion
in an instant; to turn to the right or left; or to give it a
backAvard progress. Besides the mechanical poAyer, how-
ever,, the inventor has called the Avinds to his aid, for should
the traveller be fa\'oured Avith propitious gales, he can by the
introduction of a common umbrella in front, avail himself
of an additional accelerator, the lightness of the vehicle and
the elevation of the conductor rendering the least breeze
sufficient to give the carriage an onward progress. Important
as this invention is on its oAvn account, however, it is doubly
so because it contains a principle which the projector declares
will nearly abolish the friction which has ever been so great
a draAvback to the powers of the mighty steam-engine, and
the removal of which will increase the powers and diminish
the cost of those engines to an almost incredible extent.?

Kilkenny, June 21.?0n Monday night a party of
armed men attacked and entered the dwelling-house of
Martin Cashin, of Templemartin, within about a mile
of the city. They beat his son, and putting a pistol to
his breast swore him not to have anything to do with the
fair ground of Templemartin in future, else his father
and family would ? meet the death of Mar uni and
Joyce.?
The following is a copy of a threatening notice which
was served on Martin Cashin, in reference to the fair
ground above alluded to ;
? Rocklin, June IC.
? At a meeting of the brethren at Rocklin Castle we
find it very unfair that you Cashin should meddle for pos-
session for the lands of the Dwyer?s, of Templemartin.
but as impertinance overruled you, you will and must be
checked for so doing. Now, Cashin, if you do so any more,
or take such liberty, you will be treated with death, ants
that most cruelly, such as Marum aud Joyce ; aud Cashin
not you alone, but any other no matter whom it may be.
let him expect to meet the same fate, and Cashin you
must learn to be a better neighbour than you are at
present, for we have many complaints against yon.

EARTHQUAKE AT RIPON, YORKSHIRE.
On Saturday morning last the inhabitants of Ripon were
alarmed by a tremendous explosion, which shook the whole
neighbourhood. On ascertaining the cause, it was found to
have been occasioned by a convulsion of nature in a field
about a mile from the town. The earth had shook to such a
degree as to leave a fissure nearly 20 yards in width, and on
plumbing the depth it was found to be twenty-four yards. It
still remains iu the same state. ?York Chronicle.
SINGULAR EFFECTS OF LIGHTNING. by
On Monday week, between two and three, pm. there was j) a
a thunder-storm at East Peckham, in this county, which 7
was remarkable for the effects produced by the lightning. Lie
It struck a small cottage near the church, inhabited by G. ?'j
Bishop, a tenant of Mr. Henham?s, at the Court Lodge.
The size of the kitchen was about nine feet square; the clu
chimney was on one side of the square. A woman was Ja "
sitting by a three legged round table ; near her was a cradle, ' 1 g
and in it her infant; beyond the cradle, almost iu contact, eha
was the clock. Such was the situation of things, when the tail
lightning struck the chimney, knocked off the upper part
close to the roof, descended into the room, and carried the be.
round-table so another, on which it laid it, legs upward,
dashed the clock and case to pieces, broke the door of a cub-
board as if it iiad been beaten with a mallet, pierced a kettle be
at the bottom, entering upwards as if a large poker had a
been forcibly driven through it, and finally made an opening BR
below the corner of the chimney. Besides this, the window /
was drawn in and laid on the floor, although the door was C
wide open. Yet, what is most astonishing is, that neither
the woman nor her infant was hurt, while the ceiling and r
walls were cracked in three or four places, aud the ends of a EL
pair of tongs were fused off. ?Kentish Observer. 7
DREADFUL THUNDER STORM AT INVERNESS?
BOY KILLED. I
On Friday week, this town and neighbourhood
were visited with a storm of thunder and lightning, which q
is here a circumstance of Aery rare occurrence. The air p E i
during the whole of tiie morning was close and sultry, and a
about three o?clock a few loud peals of thunder, preceded by
lightning, were heard. At Altnrlie-point, near Culloden, on
the shores of the Moray Frith, the storm was severe. Be- e
tween three and four o?clock, the lightning was uncommonly L
vivid, and the thunder tremendous. The affrighted vii-
lagers fled for safety, or ran about in the utmost terror and ' A
confusion; and a hoy who was herding cattle in a field, n
was struck down by a flash of lightning, and instant!) *
expired. Another youth was standing about twelve yards g
distant, and Avas struck to the ground, but Avas not a
injured. The cattle also fell, cither from lightning, h
or the effect of the thunder. Several persons ran to the spot
where the body of the boy lay, and found it lifeless. The p
electric fluid must have struck about the head or neck, which I
Avas disfigured; one of the ears was cut off, and the collar of
the deceased?s coat burned away. It seemed to have passed
downwards between his clothes and body, causing deep gashes y
in the breast and in one of the legs, and burning his skin and Ta
under clothes. Descending to the earth at his feet, the nails [
in the boy?s shoes were driven out, and a large bole formed in 1
the earth, part of which Avas scattered about to the distance
of seven or eight yards. The unfortunate l4 years 1
of age, his name Avas John Burgess, and he was the son of a ?_
fisherman at Petty. About the time of this melancholy oc- c
currence, the lightning also entered a house near Campbelton,
penetrating it by the gable end, when it shivered the bed to B
pieces, and broke the Avindows Avith the exception of a single fjg

Government has resolved to form a new settlement on
the southern coast of Australia, near Spencer?s GuK,
which contains a harbour, named Port Lincoln, of suffi-
cient capacity to contain in its three coves ail the navy of
England. Captain Stuart, of the 39th regiment, reports
that five million acres of the richest land he ever saw
approximates on St. Vincent?s Gulf, and abuts on the
Murray River, which is navigable lor large craft for one
thousand miles in an easterly direction ; Kangaroo Island
lies iff the entrance of these two gulfs, and abounds in
salt, fish, seals, kangaroos, and possesses a good soil. The
whole lies in latitude from 34 to 36 S., and in longitude
E. from 136 to 140. An interesting feature in this esta-
blishment is, that all the land is to be sold, and the pro-
duce is to be expended in the encouragement of agricul-
tural families to emigrate. It is, according to the evidence
ot several officers who have examined it, a land of corn,
wine, and oil.
The following account of the exports and imports of
he port of Launceston, Van Dieman?s Land, during tiie
year ending the 5 h of January, 1834, shows, even under
their present difficulties, that these colonies are becoming
a great consuming- power of the produce of Great Britain.
The total exports to Great Britain amounted to 45,7901.,
of Avhich wools amount d to 33.654b, of wheat to 4,9471.,
and flour to 1051. To New South Wales the exports
were 17,0901, and other parts 8,1981., in all 71,0861.
The imports from Great Britain amounted to 70 225!.,
the major part of which consisted of British produce and
manufactures ; from New South Wales, to the amount of
23,4571.; other parts to 9,4001.; total imports, 103,0821.
Mr. CBCouneii?s threat about a call of the house hts
already begun to operate; but, curiously enough, it seems
to operate most powerfully upon the Irish members.
Thus, on Friday, leave of absence was given, by the
house, to Mr. William Stuart, six Aveeks ; Sir Robert
Heron, a month; Mr. Finn, six weeks; Coi. Buller,
six weeks; Mr. Richard Oswald, a month ; Mr.
O?Brien, a month ; and Mr. Wallace (of Carlow), six
weeks.

one �f those who attended the commemoration of Handel

data, that four individuals from one hotel, Mivwrt's, now
go regularly 10 the Abbey, as they did befoie, though at
the distance of ha if a century i These are Miss Pryme,
Lord Mount Edgecumbe, Lord Far n barn, and Mr.-Pratt.
?Literary Gazette.
The neighbourhood of Tower-hill now presents a very
animated appearance in consequence of the exertions of
the different officer sent up from Sheerness and Chatham
to raise men for tbeir respective ships fitting out at those
ports. It is said that upwards of one thousand men are
required. The following officers have been appointed for
this duty ;?Lieutenant Batts, of the Columbine, Lieut.
Warden, of the Thalia; Lieur. Cartwright, of the Rose;
and Mr. R. Birtwhistle, of the Columbine, the examining
medical officer to tiie Perseus receiving-ship, lying off the
Tower. A lieutenant from the Winchester is also daily
expected.
It appears by the papers from the United States that our
government seriously intends settling the Falkland Islands,
on the ground that they will be convenient to our ships pro-
ceeding to the Pacific. Captain Fitzroy, in the Beagle, had
proceeded to survey them, and Lieut. H. Smith, late First
Lieutenant of the Tyne, had been appointed governor with
a boat?s crew of four men, who were to be joined by a party of
Royal Marines from England. The islands, it was ascer-
tained, were by no means so unproductive as Avas said, and a
limited number of settlers Avould do well qu Easter Island,
where it was intended the head-quarters of the government
should be fixed, which establishment Avas forming at Port
Louis at the head of Berkley Sound. There were at least
7,000 head of fine wild cattle, and 500 wild horses on the
island, roving over a lai*gc expanse of excellent pasturage.
Game was also abundant, as well as rabbits, and the shore
abounded with excellent fish, Avkales, and seals. There Avas
no timber on the island, but an abundance of peat, a never-
failing fuel, and the climate was by no means so severe as
might be expected.

Quesada ere too late, has now placed the northern pro-
vinces in the power of Don Carlos.
The account which the Quotidienne has received is the
following :? %( Zumalacarreguy being aware that Lorenzo
had left Pampeluna with 2000 men, in order to protect
the entry of Quesada into that city, marched out to meet
him. On the 18th instant, a very warm and protracted
combat took place, in which Zumalacarregnv made 400
prisoners?and there were from 200 to 300 Christinos
killed. Excited by this partial success, the Carlist gene-
ral then marched against Quesada?and on the next Hav
the 39th, he encountered him. The combat wai
bloody. Zumalacarreguy made 800 prisoners,
place between the united forces of Lorenzo? and Linares,
about 4000 men strong on the one hand, and 10 ball

hand. The carnage, it says, was horrible, and tl
tinos were worsted. A Carlist corps had on the
Sunday endeavoured to provoke the garrison of

religion. But we trust that the number of such
Englishmen any where is small; and that all who
can exercise any influence in the present con-
test will remember the words of Him who has said,
