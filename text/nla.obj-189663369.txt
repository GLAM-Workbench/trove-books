Preface.
The substance of this publication was contained in a discourse
preached in St. Paul s Church, Adelaide, on Sunday Evening’,
June 16, 1872. Some of those who listened to this
including a number of persons not ordinarily under my own
ministry, desired its publication. In complying with their
request, I am troubled chiefly with the apprehension that I may
have ill represented Professor Maurice’s doctrine. Much of his
most characteristic teaching I have been compelled to leave
unnoticed. But I do very earnestly trust that I have not mis-
represented him in any important particular. It is hardly
necessary to say that the discourse (as now printed) contains
much additional matter. I have felt it necessary to give fuller
explanation of some things which could only be cursorily dealt
with in a spoken address. And some things, suitable enough
for a confidential communication between a pastor and his
people, but not suitable for a publication which may reach
persons at a distance, have been omitted. The appended notes
may help to fill up the meagre outline of exposition, to those
who have little acquaintance with the writings, or the history to
which they refer.
As to the general character of Mr. Maurice’s life and work,
I do not think this could be better described than in certain
memorable words of Archdeacon Hare :— * “It would be a
blessing, he said in 1849, “beyond all blessings if we could
send forth a few priests, feeling that the Word and Sacraments
are really committed to them, and that the trust is a most awful
one, that they have nothing to do with the catch words of this
party or that, that they may be the messengers of peace to high
and low, that God has indeed founded Zion, and that the poor
of His people may trust in it. It is terrible to see the noblest
bravest spirits driven to despair by coldness and heartlessness:’
led, too, to think the Church the crudest of taskmasters, instead
or the most loving of mothers; led to spurn the truths which in
their inmost heart they are confessing and longing for ....

the dark and base, but among the good and gentle, if, by our
sympathy with one such spirit, we could persuade him that God
is true, though men be liars, that the Gospel is as free and large
as it ever was; that it can satisfy all the special longings and
cravings of their time, which are so absolutely incapable of
satisfying themselves.” It was precisely such a work that Mr.
Maurice did, and such a reproach that he endured.

St. Paul’s Parsonage, Adelaide,
June 29, 1872.


The duty I have imposed on myself this evening, is
one not easy to perform ; and I am quite uncertain
as to my being able to do what I have undertaken.
Let me remind you of the terms of the notice given
last Sunday. It was that I would, this evening,
attempt to give a review of the life and work of
Frederick Denison Maurice. It can be no more
than an “ attempt.” But I trust that, though I
may fail to give you a right appreciation of the
noble and beautiful life he lived, and of the work
he did, I may be able at least to do something to-
wards that end. You will have new proof given
you that, even in this igth century, we have not
wanted for saintly men ; and every retrospection of
such a life lived faithfully to the very last, must do
something towards raising even the poor level of
our own life. On the sth Sunday after Easter,
when discoursing on that collect which I connect
more closely than any other with him and his
teaching,* I was grieved and perplexed by the news
which the telegraph had brought us on the previous
day, in a single crushing line, of his lamentable
death ; and on that occasion some unpremeditated
words were wrung from me, in which I indicated
some part of the witness he had borne to his age.
But in the troubled state of mind in which they
were spoken, the words could not be other than
confused and imperfect. Since then I have received

that for the 6th Sunday after the Epiphany.


from one well able to give it, the whole story of his
last days on earth. Since then also, I have had the
opportunity of revolving in my mind all I have
learnt from him, during 25 years in which I have
been his grateful disciple, and of recalling many
blessed personal recollections of him, which are
now, alas ! all that remain. I have pondered, too,
on the/work he has done for others, of various
character and differing history, and on the service
he has rendered to many sincere seekers after truth,
both within and without our Church. And it has
seemed to me right that the life of one so remark-
able, and the living power of good he exercised
over a wide sphere of influence, should be made
the subject of a serious and connected review.
Thank God, that into our later Church life, there
has entered a spirit at once of stronger faith and
larger charity. It would be unworthy of us, were
we not to recognize the claims on our gratitude
established by those who have created this better
spirit; and this gratitude will be the deeper, when
we consider the cost to themselves at which they
did it.
I approach this subject, however, with fear and
trembling; for the man of whom I shall have to
speak was the very best, purest, most generous,
most loving, most modest, most manly and chi-
valrous, and, to sum up all in one word, most
Christlike,* of all the men I have ever known on
earth. And who am I that I should speak of him?
lam “a man of unclean lips.” I dare not venture
even to praise him, for he had need to be a good
man in a deeper sense than I can claim to be, who
should be worthy to do that. But on the other
hand, I dare not withhold my testimony concerning
* This epithet of Christlike represents most accurately the impression pro-
duced on those who saw him for even a short time : and it was an impression
which fuller knowledge of him only deepened.


him. I owe my very self to him. With him I
connect every good and useful thing I have ever
been enabled to do since my ministry began ; and,
when I recall the wrong things done, the mean
states of feeling sometimes indulged, the pain such
recollections bring is sharpened by the thought
that I, who have had, in such a teacher, a living
representation of Christ before my very eyes, could
only have so sinned through an unnatural hardness
and callousness of heart. In all my sin, I feel my-
self a worse sinner than those who have never been
brought within the circle of such purifying in-
fluences.
The first thing we have to notice in the life of His Unitarian
Professor Maurice is, that he started from a dif- extraction-
ferent point from the great majority of his fellow
Churchmen. The teaching of his earlier years was
not only not Church teaching, but a continual, even
if a kind and charitable, protest against it. His
father was a Unitarian minister, and the influence
over him of that scheme of doctrine must, I sup-
pose, have been powerful in those earlier years,
when his own mind had not yet fully awakened to
know its own wants. Out of that system he had
to work his way in his early manhood, under the
guidance of “ The Spirit of Truth,” who ever
comes most powerfully to the assistance of those
who are seeking His guidance in perfect purity of
heart But, whatever may have been the un-
conscious bias of religious teeling given to his
earlier years, in that household, the picture was His early
certainly there presented of a family perfectly uni- householdlife-
ted, in which the fatherly and the filial relations
were beautifully fulfilled. And we, who know how
the family relation lay at the foundation of all his
later teaching concerning the Divine constitution of
human society, cannot ignore the help that may
have been given him in his father’s house, in laying


hold so firmly of the truth of the Divine Fatherhood.
No one can estimate the great influence, even as
respects the growth of faith, exerted by a human
father who is in his own house unrighteous, unlov-
ing, or even arbitrary and capricious—how the
recollection of such a fatherhood may interpose to
bewilder the minds of his children, when they are
besought to believe that God is their Father. In
this case there was no such perplexity. It may be
added, that all the moral influences around him in
that home were pure and engaging, and, as affect-
ing the growth of intelligence and taste, cultivated
and refined. This was the start in life, in the form-
ation of character, to which, notwithstanding the
completely different form his ultimate belief as-
sumed, I believe the great teacher departed, con-
tinued to look back to the last, with a filial reverence
and affection which never for even a single instant
wavered. He had the priceless blessing, too, of a
mother whose rich power of affection and sponta-
neous sympathy with every noble purpose, enabled
her to identify herself, from first to last, with each
new development of her son’s mind. It was his
happiness to live to see* all the beloved members
of his family circle escape with him from Unitari-
anism, to receive with love and joy the Catholic
truth of Christ’s eternal sonship, to believe in Him,
with S. Thomas, as “ Lord and God.” The growth
of his faith was formative, also, over the growing
* It was close upon the time when I left England in 1854, with the memory
fresh on me of the scenes to which the following words refer—soon after the
agitation of the King’s College decision (referred to more fully in page )
that Mr. Maurice had to endure sorrow on sorrow, in the death of his mother,
and of his sister Miss Priscilla Maurice, a woman of very remarkable character.
Each one of his departed sisters has left some trace of the beauty of nature,
and persistency in some unselfish work which they, in common with him,
manifested through a pure and self-sacrificing career. One, in her “ Aids to
Development,” and other helps to education, when such helps were few ; in
her beautiful “ Memorials of Two Sisters” who died young, and other writings.
Another, referred to above (who herself endured a long martyrdom) in her
book entitled “ Sickness : its Trials and Blessings,” wiitten in intervals


thought of the younger members of his father’s
household, whilst over the elder it tended to widen
the sympathy of human and Christian love, which
the narrower scheme of doctrine to which they had
adhered, on their first emergence from Unitarian
negation, might have unnaturally contracted. This
was the way in which the son and brother rewarded
the solicitous affection which hovered over him, as
an influence of good, during all his earlier years.
I have given marked prominence to his Unitarian
extraction, because I see some public writers have
dwelt on it much. They have not, however, told
the whole story of even that portion of his life.
The difference in his start in life, as a thinker The insight
and believer, proved of immense advantage to him
in dealing with those who were little likely to be derived from
influenced by the ordinary Anglican teaching,* experience,
which rested on authority, and, though not refusing
to consider perplexed states of mind, yet frequently
looked on them with a kind of displeased surprise
or impatience. He learned to see too, that though
snatched with pain and difficulty, from sufferings which would have deprived
women of the common order at once of the disposition and the capacity for
thus ministering to others. Another, in “ Words of Hope and Comfort to
those in sorrow,” only circulated amongst a private though very wide circle of
friends. This last (Mrs. Julius Hare) during the ten years of her residence in
Herstmonceux Rectory, was an angel of mercy and sympathy in every home in
that parish, from the highest to the lowest; and the story of her widowhood
was sacred and beautiful. But still another memorial of the generosity and
devotion of that sisterhood survives in the “ Beachmen’s Church,” at Great
Yarmouth, their offering of sympathy and help to the then Vicar, Bishop
Hills. I cannot refrain from giving these details, and trust I may be forgiven
if I should seem to have made too public, private deeds of charity.
♦ The Anglicanism here indicated, it must be remembered, was the colder,
more soulless Anglicanism which has now nearly entirely passed away. It
preserved the form of correct doctrine, but the power of originating new pro-
cesses of thought, or of adapting the old to the new requirements of an eager
and restless age, had become miserably feeble. It had not as yet been baptized
with a better spirit by John Henry Newman. That powerful thinker and true
saint has long been missed from our company, but the English Church, much
as he may have wounded her, still owes to him a deep debt of gratitude for the
more spiritual temper which he diffused through the school with which the
best part of his life is identified. Many persons suppose the secret of the
power he wielded lay in the singular subtlety of his thought, and the logical
acuteness with which, at different periods, he defended different theological


Unitarianism consists very much of denials, yet its
strength does not lie in these. It was not in the
spirit of denial that the best men he had known in
his youth embraced it, or adhered to it. They were
seeking to know God as Love, which was precisely
the thing the 18th century orthodox teaching had
left in doubt. The Church theology of that day
did not speak even of a living personal God, but
drove as far as possible from the actual life of men
the idea of His Presence in the midst of them, re-
sorting to such polite phrases as “ The Deity,”
“ The Supreme Being,” or, which still survives
as the appropriate euphemism in State recognitions
of the fact that there is a God, “ Divine Providence.”
All this wretchedly mocked the desire of the truest
men to know whether this world of toiling, suffer-
ing men, has a God who has Himself a life which
can meet theirs at every point, and if so, to know
Him as He is. Unitarian teaching did speak of
God as Father, and did set forth His love as some-
thing with which men could feel sympathy. All
this Mr. Maurice clearly saw, though he perceived
also that the notion of Divine love thus set forth,
was one shorn of its true glory. But yet through
all his life he could see, in the men adhering to that
“ system*,” a true desire and endeavour after some-
thing better, which they had just missed. It was
with a singular sympathy and yearning of heart
positions. But a deeper cause will be found in the fact that he, too, through
a series of spiritual trials which were to him like a constant baptism of fire,
was enabled to ally himself with so many states of mind in others, of however
various history; and that the men who looked on him knew hardly which
most to admire, the insight which was so keen, the genius which was so in-
spiring, the nature which was so truthful, or the spirit which was so gallant in
its determination to lose all things for conscience sake. Different as was
the turn of mind in Dr. Newman and in Professor Maurice, the work they
did had its points of resemblance, and the reverential affection and gratitude
they were able to kindle in great multitudes of men of the higher sort,
intellectually and spiritually, were in kind essentually the same.
* The word “ system” was always to him a kind of “ b6te noire.” It was
through men’s fondness for systematizing that he thought they had been hin-
dered from personal faith and love.


towards them that, in after years, he showed how
their denial of Christ in His Godhead, prevented
them from really seizing on that truth of which
they were in quest. The perfection of God’s love
he saw could be only fully made known in a Divine
Redeemer. The reality of His Fatherhood could
only be manifested in one eternally His Son.
Thus, amongst those of the Unitarians who were
not merely sectarian, that is to say, those who
valued truth more than the interests of their “ de-
nomination,” some of his most remarkable converts
were found. And yet he was no mere proselytiser.
He had a due sense of the evil of defective forms
of belief; but he also felt the deep responsibility
resting on any man who simply dislodges his fellow
from any mooring of faith to which he is content
for the present to hold fast, unless he is certain
that he can lead him on to something better. But
his own strong faith glowed like fire in the presence
of all with whom he came in contact. He told
them what God had taught him, with an almost
pleading humility referring to his greater personal
need of being so taught; and they, carrying away
with them what he had told them, found it had re-
volutionized their whole inward life.
In some respects his story runs parallel with that Parallel be-
of St. Augustine. That great Father gamed new ands ; Augus .
power to search the human heart through his earlier tine-
inclination to the Manichaen belief. He was able
the better to identify himself with states of mind
leading men away from Catholic truth. And he
was led, in consequence of his fuller acquaintance
with secret causes of doubt, to uphold that truth
with other than the merely traditional arguments.
It is necessary to refer thus fully to this part of
Mr. Maurice’s history. It is the more necessary, and narrow-
because some narrow-minded and ignorant writers, ™™ ded ortho ‘
adopting the tone of We are the men , wisdom will


die with us! yet wholly unable to understand the
course of such a perfectly truthful mind as his,
have accounted for what they call “ his eccentricities
of doctrine,” by the supposition that some of the
evil taint of early teaching, still unconsciously af-
fected him, and led him astray. They described
him as one who was “at heart a Unitarian still.”
But this was because the men were dull of appre-
hension, or because they had refused the conscien-
tious study needful to understand him. Unitarians
themselves could tell a different tale. They know
that his peculiar mode of asserting the Catholic
doctrine, has more powerfully acted on the minds
of their own people, in the way of drawing them
aside into the ways of orthodoxy, than any influence
whatever which has in this generation been brought
to bear on them.
In all this, I have been doing little more than
clearing the way for that review of his whole life
which I am attempting.
In entering on this review, we see one singularly
eager-minded, preparing himself for his life’s work.
His early life was spent in or near Bristol, which
already the influence of a few persons of remark-
able genius had constituted a kind of centre of in-
tellectual activity. And now,* still hardly more
than a boy, he sought the highest education then
open to him. This was at Cambridge, always the
more liberal of the Universities, which even then
opened its whole apparatus of teaching to men of
all communions ; not requiring subscription of Ar-
ticles until all examinations had been passed;
though requiring it before actually conferring a

gather this from dates ; for the year of his birth is given as 1805, and the class-
list in which at the close of his under-graduateship, his name appears in the
Ist Class in Civil Law, is that of 1826-7. ® ut at this end of the world I have

degree. He passed the usual examinations, we are
told, “ with distinction.” But he could not then,
with a good conscience, sign the Articles. His
College not only offered him a Fellowship, but went
so far as to propose to keep the appointment open
for a year or two, in the hope of of his overcoming
the scruples of conscience which hindered him from
qualifying himself by subscription. Generous as
the offer was, however, he would have felt himself
a man forsworn had he entertained it. What he His first great

not do with it. This sacrifice of a career that
must have been full of attraction to him, is the
more remarkable because —such was the lowered
moral standard of the time—the scruples which re-
strained him were such as many honourable men of
that day would have considered rather wire-drawn.
For in truth there was not much in the Articles
which he could not receive, certainly very little
little which touched on the cardinal matters of faith.
Already the influence of S. T. Coleridge* was
powerful over him. Had his judgment not been
perplexed by considerations of personal interest, he
might even then have felt himself free to take his
proper place—young as he was—as a most dis-
tinguished member of the University. But he
* Archdeacon Hare, long a Fellow and Tutor of Trinity College, Cambridge,
has thus described the religious temper of the young men at the University at
that time “At Cambridge, with the exception of a considerable body who
attached themselves to Mr. Simeon, hardly any of the young men took
interest in doctrinal theology, unless such as were preparing for the Ministry.
The bulk of them were content to hold the opinions which they had imbibed
from their parents and teachers. Some of the more thoughtful ventured now
and then into speculation on the primary questions of Natural Theology. To
these the appearance of “ The Aids to Reflection ” (of S. T. Coleridge), was
almost like a new birth, opening their way into higher regions of thought,
after they had long been disgusted with the course which the University
appointed for them through the dead level of Paley. So barren had our
Church been for nearly a century, thatjthey who hungered after a more sub-
stantial and generous fare than was to be met with at the meagre tables of the
ordinary evangelical writers, were forced to go beyond its limits, to Robert
Hall, to Chalmers, to Irving; for the writings of Horsley and of Davison were
not of a kind to satisfy their wants.”


vindicated his honour by determining to leave his
mind free. After some time spent in London in
literary labor, in which the exuberance of his mind
had full play, his liberated faith grew and strength-
ened. And at length, it was with a free heart, and
a conscience no longer perplexed by considerations
of self-interest, that he accepted the doctrine of the
Church.
Any ordinary man would now have returned to
Cambridge, signed the Articles, and without further
trouble obtained his degree. But the man whose ca-
reer we are tracing was very different from the ordi-
nary type of men. Because he had made up his mind
to sign the Articles, he determined to enter on a
fresh course of study at Oxford, where this was the
first requirement, and where he could assure him-
self that, in doing this thing, he was purchasing to
himself no worldly advantage. But the sacrifice
of worldly advantage was at all times a pleasure
and delight to a nature like his, which found its
highest joy in trampling self under foot. The more
serious privation consisted in the postponement for
years of his opportunity of uttering the thoughts
with which his mind was teeming. The social
element in his nature was always predominant.
No bright and kindling thought in his mind could
he regard as merely his own. Student as he
was, in the most complete meaning of the word,
he could never have been content with the luxurious
enjoyment in his study, of the treasures of his own
intellectual life. He was always panting for utter-
ance : and therefore, to me, the most beautiful
feature of the fresh novitiate which he imposed on
himself at Oxford, seems to be, the necessity of long
silence which he deliberately accepted. It was
closed in 1831, when he took his degree, just two
years before the rise of the new Anglican movement
in our Church, on which he looked, from first to


last, not only with the deepest interest, but with a
power of searching the meaning of its growth and
progress, which he never could have acquired with-
out a personal residence at Oxford.
This power of insight, however, he purchased at
the cost of the sacrifice of a large portion of his
own life, in so far as life can be reckoned by mere
years of existence.
The result of the long struggle of conscience His first
which was signalized in his Oxford career, appeared P u “ b ',
in a distinct form in his first serious publication, scnption no
entitled “ Subscription no Bondage.” Bondage.”
To those who have carefully followed the course
of his mind, this will probably appear the most
characteristic of all his publications. He already
discarded the notion that Creeds or Articles were
essentially, or chiefly, tests of orthodoxy. They
had, he conceived, a far higher meaning. The
Creeds he regarded as the great bond of union
between the Catholic Church and the whole body
of the people, whether learned or unlearned. They
contained the profoundest mysteries of faith, and
yet in them the wayfaring man found the expression
of the simplest and most elemental truths. But to
the Articles he assigned a different meaning. Their
special office was to guide the studies of men of
the more learned class, removing out of their way
the errors and superstitions which had grown up
in the course of history.
In his later years, though he retracted none of the
principles contained in this pamphlet, he admitted
the necessity of no longer attempting to impose the
Articles, either as a condition of entrance on study,
or as a preliminary to the certificate of competency
which marked the conclusion of its first critical
stage. For the men principally concerned regarded


them as pledging them, on the very threshold of
their intellectual life, to conclusions which, even
if in the end arrived at, they thought should belong
to a more mature stage of enquiry. He had
designed to liberate them not only from “the idols
of the Forum and the Cave,” but from all growth
of past superstition darkening their minds. He
respected, however, the complaint of those who
saw in Subscription only a fetter on their limbs, or
a temptation to their conscience.
Passing by the time spent in his first curacy, in
a rural parish, we find him for ten years occupied
as the chaplain of Guy’s Hospital in London. A
memorial of this still survives in a striking sermon
on The Responsibilities of Medical Students , from
which I cannot refrain from quoting a few sentences.
They shew us very clearly the spirit of all his work.
He tells the students of medicine and of man’s
frame, that “ they ought to be the least imposed
upon by the shapes and outsides of things.” He
contrasts with the true physician, “the unhappy
empiric who, for the sake of pelf, trifles with the
lives of God’s creatures,” and to whom “there is
no wonder at all in the origin and growth of
disease.” And he signalises the nobler work of
him, who with sincere purpose to discover the
source of that which causes so much evident
misery, feels continually that he is going farther
and farther away from mere shows and appear-
ances. “ How often,” he exclaims, “when we de-
scribe to you some local suffering, you ask about
other feelings which seemed to us most entirely un-
connected with it, and refer both to some secret
derangement in the powers of life.” To those who
have entered into Mr. Maurice’s teaching, there is
an undertone of deeper expression in such words


as these, showing that he was seeking the right
spirit in which to deal with the moral as well as
physical disease which has afflidted humanity as a
whole. But one thing more I must gather from
this part of his history. He speaks to these future
healers of the body in language which must have
strangely stirred their higher and purer ambition —
the ambition to fulfill a trust. “It is not a light
thing,” he says, “to see a fellow-creature looking
into your face, and asking whether you cannot give
him a week—a day more of life. . . . Such
looks should not depart out of the memory, at least
not out of the heart, for assuredly they will meet
us again on our own death-beds, and at the day of
revelation.” And then, referring to the disclosure
of the truer nature of the worst sinners when death
is drawing nigh, and in general to the absence of
all disguise in times of sickness, he says, “This is
not taught language: it is not cant language: it is
the sincere utterance of a heart which is compelled
by death and despair, to speak out the true thing
which it has long hidden and kept down within it.
Here, then, are testimonies, issuing from the very
lowest pit into which humanity can sink, of its
grandeur and glory. Yes! you will see your fellow-
creatures stripped of all the disguises in which they
have shewed themselves off in the world. You will
see them in the furiousness of passion, in the depth
of pride and pettiness; and yet, I tell you, that you
shall never see a man or woman who does not ex-
hibit some token of belonging to a race which God
created in His own image.” Here is the germ of
his whole doctrine, and therefore I recall it.
It was at this time that he published his Letters His Letters on
on the Kingdom of Christ, in which every essential of h chSt. gd ° m
principle of his later teaching is contained.*
* It is right to note this, because in the King’s College controversy in 1854,

Maurice s hie is comprised. birst, setting aside
many fugitive contributions to literature, there was
his preaching at Lincoln’s Inn, whereby he con-
nected himself, directly or indirectly, at once with
the highest intelligence and the most devout
thought of the country. Secondly, there were his
Professorships at King’s College, where he gave a
wonderful stimulus to the minds of promising
students, and stirred in their hearts a pure and
noble enthusiasm, which at this day is producing
good fruit in various parts of the world. Thirdly,
I may signalize his efforts, in connection with the
“ Christian Socialists,” to redress the wrongs of the
working-class, and at a later time in the Working-
Men’s College, to reduce to practice the principles
contained in his book on “ Learning and Working.”
Fourthly, in Queen’s College, he did much for the
higher education of women. Fifthly, in his Incum-
bency of St. Peter’s, Vere Street, he brought much
of his former work to a point, and gathered around
him a still wider circle of followers. Last of all,
in his Chair of Moral Philosophy and Theology at
Cambridge, he gave utterance to thoughts as fresh
and vigorous as at any portion of his life. For a
short time he held also the Vicarage of St. Edward’s,
Cambridge.

charge. You want to know what were the Christian
Dr. Jelf spoke of himself as taken by surprise by the publication, by Mr.
Maurice, of new—and as he deemed them—dangerous opinions in the
“ Theological Essays.” The present writer at the time pointed out passages
in “The Kingdom of Christ,” in which the obnoxious opinions are clearly
contained.


truths he especially taught, and how far these
really contained the doctrine of Christ. It is be-
cause I believe he, not only in his person but in his
teaching, gave living expression to the very mind
of Christ, that I dwell with such reverence on his
memory. He has rightly been described as a
“ Reforming Theologian.” But I must ask you to
remember that his idea of Reform was not de-
struction, but conservation of all that was valuable
in the teaching of past ages, and reform only in
the way of building up anew the eternal truth that
had been in danger of being buried.
Those who love him know very well the constant
strain of outcry against his teaching, even in its
manner of expression. Lazy or incompetent
readers of his books have described him as a writer
“misty” or “obscure.” They confess that he
gives them a general impression of something good
and beautiful, but they can trace no clear line of
thought. They imply that he is obscure because
he has written in haste, and has not taken the
requisite means to make his meaning plain. I
venture to say that no true student would so de-
scribe him. And although I am wholly unworthy
of such a designation, I at least can testify that the
conceptions of truth which I have derived from his
writings, stand out before my own mind with a
reality and clearness of outline which I greatly
wish I could have found in those of more than one
or two other teachers.
I cannot pretend to traverse the whole course
over which Mr. Maurice’s teaching has extended ;
but I will select some of those great features of his
doctrine as to which ordinary Christians have some
right to be reassured, and in reference to these,
try to make you understand what he teaches.
Some of you may disapprove of that teaching, but
I will try so to expound his doctrine that at least


no one shall have any pretext for saying that its
meaning is not clear.
I. I naturally select first that portion of his
teaching which is in most marked opposition to
what you might have expected from his early
training. In dealing with the great Catholic truth
of the union in One Nature of God the Father,
God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost, he differed
only from many of the common defenders of this
truth in this—that he could not hold it merely as
an opinion, that he came to regard it as the basis,
not only of his own, but of all human life. He
could not see any coherent purpose in the history
of man without this. It seemed to him to lie at
the base of the whole structure of God’s communi-
cations with man. In its light, all was clear.
Without it, all seemed to him to be darkness.
It happened, at a later point in his life than that
at which I have glanced, that a Scotch Calvanistic
Divine —Dr. Candlish, the High Priest of the most
narrow modern cultus , undertook a journey to Lon-
don for the express purpose of exposing what he
considered Mr. Maurice’s heresies. One would
have thought this must have been to some grave
council of instructed theologians, but in fact, it was
to the imperfectly educated young men who frequent
Exeter Hall. No indictment before a learned body
however, could have touched the accused so keenly
as this attempt to turn from him the hearts of young
men in whose candid nature he saw the promise of
much good. And, though some of those who knew
him well, and thought it would have been better
for him to have disdained his assailant, were sur-
prised at his noticing an accusation, coming from
such a quarter, and addressed to such a court of
trial, he at once replied to the charge. In the pro-
test against false accusation then extorted from him,
he incidentally stated his belief in a way which is


better than any exposition of mine would be, he
says: “I affirm that when I believe in God the
Father, in God the Son, and in God the Holy Ghost
—I am escaping from opinions. I believe that I
am at the centre of God’s revelations of Himself:
I believe that He has led us out of our crude and
miserable opinions about Him, to that Name which
expresses what He is in Himself, what He is in re-
lation to me, and to all the Universe.” A brilliant
and thoughtful journalist of the present day—him-
self I believe formerly a Unitarian—has frequently
called attention to Mr. Maurice’s great services in
the elucidation of this truth. And the belief de-
veloped in his own mind* he has explained very
fully in a remarkable essay on the Incarnation.
He tells his readers how he had learnt to see that
the Fatherhood in God which formerly he had been
seeking to realize, he had never firmly grasped as
a reality until he had laid hold on the great truth
that a Father eternally existing, demands an
Eternal Son in whom “to mirror” His perfections.
God must be conceived of as existing independently
of time, as existing when as yet creation had not
sprung into being; and if God is eternally Love,
there must have been, or rather, must he, an eternal
object of that Love.
11. The next feature of Mr. Maurice’s teaching The incama-
which I shall select is his doctrine of the Consti-
tution of Human Society. Here, through his whole Unity of Man
series of writings, he is clear in exposition and kmd ‘
always consistent with himself. All dreams of
unity appearing in the various theories of those
who have preached a doctrine of human progress,
resulting in an ultimate perfection of man, he looks
upon as so many gropings after a great truth which
Christianity has brought to light. This truth is
* “Tracts of Priest and People.”—2nd Series.


the constitution of mankind in one Catholic Church.
The Incarnation is with him not a mere dogma:
it is the fundamental fact in which all the various
relations of men to one another find unity and
coherence. He sees, in the Incarnation, not
merely the reconstruction of society out of the
ruins of the Fall, but the explanation and revelation
of God’s purpose in its original constitution. It is
not the selection of certain units among mankind,
to satisfy the world-wide desire for the union of
men in one body, by a specious and unreal appear-
ance of it. It is the restoration of humanity in
perfect truth, to its original idea. This is with him
the central act, explaining all the rest of God’s
actings in the world. He has protested against
the disposition manifest in Puritan* theology un-
consciously to disparage the Incarnation, by limit-
ing the range within which its power extends. In
Christ’s taking our manhood to Himself, He sees
the regeneration of humanity as a whole ; and the
evil and corruption remaining among men he traces
to the disposition still to seek another centre than
that which, in the Incarnation, has been provided.
He exclaims against all ideas of Church life which
proceed on the principle of mere exclusion, and
specially, against the Predestinarian notion. He
sees in Our Lord Jesus Christ the King and Head
of all men, and resents, as treachery to Him, what-
ever may hinder any man from believing that he
can claim his part in the Christian election.
HI. His language concerning Revelation, has
been held to be vague and unsatisfactory, by those
writers especially who regard Revelation as wholly
external —as a body of truth contained exclusively
in certain inspired writings. His doctrine on this
♦ It must be understood that by “Puritan” I do not mean “Nonconformist”
theology. Mr. Maurice’s writings have penetrated very deeply into the Non-
conformist teaching of the present day.


subject may be unsatisfactory to some, but it can-
not consistently with truth be called “vague.” It
is on the contrary most definite, and has set at rest
the misgivings of many who were seriously troubled
by the thought of vast multitudes, in ancient and
modern times, who have never known the contents
of the Bible. It may be stated very much as fol-
lows. He regards Revelation* as “ the unveiling
Himself of God to man,” not in one way, but with
that variety of operation which St. Paul himself
describes as a characteristic feature of all activity
of the Spirit of God, whether in His action on the
“ knowing” faculties of man, or on his feelings and
will. Mr. Maurice sees in the earlier ages such
unveiling constantly proceeding. Creation itself is
an unveiling of God, and it is the glory of science
that it has made more fully known this part of His
Revelation to mankind. But it is in the moral
order of the world that the Revelation of One alto-
gether good, is most perfectly given. Most clearly
among the chosen people, who were elected to bear
witness of God’s ways to all nations; yet also,
though more dimly, amongst heathen people, he
sees God constantly revealing Himself. “ The
Word of the Lord,” the utterance of the secret
mind of God, which the old prophets set forth as
their special ground for claiming a hearing, is a
phrase which may be properly applied to all utter-
ances of God’s mind whatever. This, in all history,
he sees going forth continually to reclaim men from
their errors or their sins. The richest and fullest
treasure of such communications of Himself is un-
doubtedly that which is contained in the Holy
Scriptures ; and this, attested by such signs of
certainty as to furnish the true standard of judg-
ment concerning all other communications. Here
* The same view of Revelation appears in the writings of the late Mr.
Erskine, of Linlathen, of Dr. McLeod Campbell, and of the Bishop of Argyll.


it was that Mr. Maurice found the means of in-
terpreting all history. Among the large number of
volumes issued from the press by him—more than
thirty in number—by far the largest part is devoted
to the study of the Bible. Yet he could not regard
the Bible as the sole Revelation, because he did
not dare to contradict the doctrine of St. John, that
the Eternal Word is a Light in the soul of every
man. Amongst enlightened heathens and ignorant
savages he finds phenomena of moral life which
cannot be explained by any reference to the culture
of the one set of men, or to the barbarism of the
other. There he sees the operation of the eternal
“ Word of the Lord.” And I can testify that, in
some most interesting conversations with our
greatest missionary, Bishop Patteson, he al-
though he no doubt disapproved of many opinions
of Mr. Maurice—had yet taken to his heart these
special truths, on which he so constantly insists,
and fulfilled his noble missionary work in the spirit
of them.
IV. His doctrine of the Atonement, however, is
that which has exposed him to the greatest reviling
on the part of men who cannot see a true doctrine
unless it is expressed in their accustomed phrases.
It has been no uncommon thing to hear, not only
himself, but those who taught what they had learnt
from him, described as “ denying the Atonement.”
So unscrupulous is the spirit which grows out of
conversancy only with the thoughts of some narrow
religious circle, that even people truly good, could
bring themselves to make a charge like this, which
implied against the men so accused, not only error
in doctrine, but a personal infamy which —had the
charge been true —should have driven them out of
the society of all honest men. For the Atonement
was that truth, which, above all others, they had
pledged themselves in the most sacred manner, to


teach. It was rather the accusers, however, than
the accused, who were fairly chargeable with
“ denying the Atonement;” for they surrounded it
with such a mass of doubtful opinion, that many
sincere disciples of Jesus were deeply troubled in
mind. It is curious to observe how, in modern times,
some of those who protest most strongly against
Romanism, are still in their theology bound hand
and foot by the formulated statements of the Roman
doctors. Thus modern Puritanism suspects heresy
in respect of the Atonement, if there be any denial
of its being the payment of a debt to Divine Justice.
Yet this doctrine dates, not from primitive times,
but from the mediaeval Anselm, who, by the force
of his strong mind, was able to fasten that teaching
on the whole Western Church. It had no place in
the writings of the earliest Fathers. In so far as
they regarded the Sacrifice of the Cross as payment
of a debt, they regarded it rather as a satisfaction
of the Devil’s demand, in strict justice, of the
punishment of the race that had sinned. I think
it may be safely said, that it never entered into their
minds to suppose there could be a conflict in the Di-
vine Nature, between rival attributes, demanding
such a sacrifice as an offering of peace between them.
Professor Maurice in his reforming theology,
sought to disencumber the pure Christian doctrine
from the burden with which later and temptingly
coherent logical systems had oppressed and obscured
it. He began to write when there had grown up
in the Evangelical School, after the glory of its
earlier life had departed, a disposition to dwell very
much on technical terms of modern manufacture.
To men seeking to know the righteousness of God
in Christ, they spoke of a “ forensic righteousness”
—a phrase the very sound of which was unpleasant
to those who were seeking some real assurance of
deliverance from personal sin. In their eagerness


and haste, too, they without intending it, perverted
the plain meaning of Scriptural language; in the
most perfect good faith representing St. Paul as
having said that God can be “just and yet the just-
ifier of the ungodly who believe in Jesus.” They
were quite unconscious of the fact that the word
“yet” which signified opposition and contrast in the
two asserted truths, was not St. Paul’s but an in-
terpolation of their own. Mr. Maurice understood
more clearly 'dth St. Paul, what was contained in
that great affirmation. With the Apostle he be-
lieved that God’s justification of the ungodly who
believe is not in spite of, but in consequence of, His
own essential justice—the fulfilment of His righteous
purpose in the original act in which He made man
in His own image. For the only “ faith in Jesus,”
which is worthy of the name, is that which recon-
ciles the averted will of man, to the righteousness
in God, of which He is the perfect Manifestation—
which makes man “ right” by restoring him to har-
mony with the Eternal Righteousness.
i. In treating of the Atonement, one of the ques-
tions he had to answer was this :—Can it be rightly
called an Expiation ?
The answer to this question altogether depends
on the meaning assigned to “ Expiation.” In so
far as the leading idea set forth in that word is
“ purgation from sin,” there was no man who more
earnestly set forth this as a cardinal feature of the
Atonement. But in much of the teaching to which
he objected, the leading idea is not so much, purg-
ation from sin, as the appeasing of vengeful wrath
against the sinner. This idea of expiation is de-
rived from a heathen state of mind. It excludes
from its view the essential sin, and fastens itself
mainly on the suffering. The essential idea of this
doctrine, however it may be modified in explanation
is, that the vengeance of God, after inflicting much


suffering, is satisfied at last in the suffering. The
restoration of peace so effected bears too close a
resemblance to the exhaustion of the elements of
anger, in our own fiercest moments of human
passion, against those who have most deeply
wronged us. But surely this is to make God as
one of the false and cruel gods of the heathen.
Against this conception of the meaning of expiation,
Mr. Maurice, as a Christian believer, could not but
cry out, as one in pain. No man bowed his head
more reverently before the thought of the Wrath
of God. But he deemed it the wrath of One who is
perfect Righteousness and Love. The pain it in-
flicted he regarded as the necessary consequence
of any deliberate attempt to set at nought the
principles of His universal Rule —a Rule main-
tained not merely for the assertion of authority, but
for the highest good of all creatures subject to it.
The opposition to Love, the opposition to Right-
eousness, on the part of any creature, must recoil
in awful suffering on the head of the offender;
because it is, within the moral sphere, a futile
attempt at omnipotence on the part of one who
thinks that he can, in his puny personal life, suc-
cessfully defy the laws of the universe of God.
A love, rooted in holiness, is the fundamental law
of our moral constitution, the condition of all hap-
piness and harmony in our nature. For anyone to
set himself in opposition to that , is to set in motion
against himself all the powers that are arrayed on
the side of good. This is the explanation of the
suffering that results from sin.
And this notion of the meaning of punishment,
as inflicted by Him who is perfect Love, necessarily
affects our view of the suffering endured by our
Lord. He bowed His head to that suffering be-
cause, as one with the Father, and one with man,
He could bear the full weight of the woe which His


fellows, with whom He had linked Himself, had
drawn on themselves. Our eye must rest, then,
not on the mere shedding of blood, but on the
deeper spiritual suffering of which that is the sign.
A most orthodox continental divine,* contending
that the Sacrifice of the Cross is the great turning-
point of the world’s history, complains of those
who have made the explanation of it a mere
“theology of blood and wounds.” In so far as it
is so it is not a Christian but a heathen theology.
The phrases of the Old and of the New Testament
which have often been quoted in defence of the
more popular theology, Mr. Maurice showed had
been interpreted only in a carnal sense. “ Without
shedding of blood is no remission of sin.” Yes,
that is undoubtedly true. But what does “the
shedding of blood” mean. The blood is the life ;
and “the life” is the expression of the man’s self.
Did our Lord indeed pour out His blood for us ?
What did this mean ? It meant that He offered
His Body and Soul—His entire nature, in all its
capacities of suffering, and all its power of will, to
God, not in the way of turning aside anger, but of
submitting to and fulfilling that Righteous Will of
the Father which was the great law of His Being.
With this view of the Atonement, the idea that
“the vials of God’s wrath were being poured out
on Him,” cannot at all be reconciled. On the
contrary, then more than ever, He was the Beloved
Son in whom “the Father is always well pleased.”
At the same time, the Atonement is in a very real
sense a satisfaction. There the holy love in God,
which delights not in mere suffering, is seen gath-
ering the suffering of His creatures to His heart,
and fulfilling itself in that extreme act of sacrifice.
All travail of the Father’s soul is satisfied in Christ,
*Ebrard.


as all travail of the Redeemer’s soul must yet be
satisfied in His redeemed, in their restored affec-
tions, and their completed submission to the One
Holy and Fatherly will. The Sacrifice of Christ
is at once the completion of the long expectation
of God, and the most perfect revelation to man of
a Divine love, for which nothing is too hard,
whether in doing or suffering.
2. Another representation of the Atonement,
occupying a large place in popular preaching, Mr.
Maurice could not receive. This was that, strictly
speaking, our Lord in His perfect innocence suf-
fered on the Cross instead of the guilty. Here
there was the same predominance of the thought
of immunity from punishment, too often considered
rather in its material than in its spiritual character;
and he objected to this representation because it is
not true. The Divine Justice which he regarded
with such an awful reverence could never be satis-
fied by mere infliction of punishment; the essential
difference between it and the imperfect justice of
man is, that it not only vindicates law, but converts
the will of the offender. In so far as I understand
him, he rejected this view on three grounds.
(i). First, it is not the fact that the human
offender has by that Sacrifice been relieved from
all the penal consequences of his transgression ;
since the best of men must still endure many and
deep sufferings in this present life which is so pain-
ful, and in that natural death which is so terrible.
(2). Secondly, this kind of justification seems to
rest on a sort of legal fiction, whereby one who
has done no sin is regarded as suffering for the sin
of some one else. On this view, the Son of God
is represented as interposing between the Eternal
Father and man in his condemnation—as One not
occupying precisely either the Divine or the human
position—but coming in as a kind of third party.


No such language as this will be found in Mr.
Maurice’s writings, but I think I do not here un-
fairly construe the language he used.
(3.) But finally, he rejected the notion of sub-
stitution in Christ’s sacrifice because it seemed to
conflict with the great Catholic principle that Christ
is the head of the Body, in which all the members
are joined together in the unity of an organic life.
Believing Him to be indeed one with us —the se-
cond Adam —our true Head —he could find no room
for such an idea as substitution. The Head may
represent the Body, may suffer in behalf of and
with it, may draw to itself as the centre of all sen-
sation its most exquisite anguish, but can in no in-
telligible use of language be said to suffer in its
stead. And when he came to consider the basis on
which this popular doctrine rests, he could not find
it in the New Testament, It was the result of a
slow and gradual growth of opinion, moulded into
its present form by human systems.
3. He did not deny, but strongly asserted, that
Christ is “ our Propitiation.” Only he contended
that we must be careful to clear our minds of false
ideas connected with the same word in heathen
systems. Pagan propitiations have tried to make
the incensed gods surrender some vengeful purpose.
The idea of making the propitiation has in such
cases proceeded from man. But in Christian doc-
trine, the propitiation proceeds from God. It is He
who in Christ reveals His propitiousness to all pe-
penitent and believing men. He is more ready to
reconcile us to Himself, than we are to be recon-
ciled. Atonement, at-one-ment, is Reconciliation ;
and this he held to be the central, distinguishing
character of Christ’s work.
4. Above all, he contended that the Atonement
is the fulfilment of an Eternal Loving Purpose.
He saw in the whole history of man the working of


a design which contemplated, as its ultimate end,
the raising man to a far higher state than that
of mere innocence. He contrasted the mere
Eden-like innocence which consisted in ignorance
of evil, with the condition of men who, after long
and sore contest with evil, are raised up to true
fellowship with Christ in His exaltation, and, with
Him , crowned with glory and honour. In this long
mysterious history, he insisted with almost passion-
ate earnestness on the perfect Unity of Will in
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; and objected to
those almost Tritheistic representations of the
Trinity, in which practically the Father is set forth
as the God of Justice, the Son as the God of Mercy,
and the Spirit as the God of Purity. He dwelt
with joy on the fact that Christ is the Lamb slain
from the foundation of the World ; and that in His
great Sacrifice, the Father was eternally taking to
His heart, and making His very own, the sorrow
and the pain which sin has spread through humanity
in all its members.
V. Any account of Mr. Maurice’s teaching would
be incomplete without some reference to his doc-
trine of Eternity. He believed that the knowledge
of God and of His Son Jesus Christ, not only will
one day procure, but actually is, Eternal Life.
He believed those words which none of you will
feel inclined to call in question: “ He that hath the
Son hath Life,” —and those others: “ This is Eter-
nal Life, to know Thee the only true God, and Jesus
Christ whom thou hast sent.” Eternity with him
meant not merely infinite duration of time, but a
fixed state of moral being. No doubt we are our-
selves now, in our own despite, compelled to think
of all things as in Time, for that is a form of thought
determining our human conceptions. We see
through a glass darkly, until at length we shall see
“face to face.” But God is “the same yesterday,


to-day, and for ever.” The life which is in Him is
not to be measured by mere ages, but by what it is.
The real awfulness of condemnation consists, not in
the length of its duration, but in the spiritual con-
dition of the condemned. The temporal life is
marked by constant changes in the outward appear-
ance of things, by shifting impressions, by compari-
son of the regular sucession of events. But Eter-
nity is that which lies beneath all this that is shift-
ing and changeable, and continues to stamp on each
change a certain moral character, which is the one
thing that assures us of the unity of human history.
This, or something like this, was a leading thought
in Mr. Maurice’s mind.
He was thankful that the Church of England had
been saved from laying down any rigid doctrine of
Everlasting Punishment, but he no less clearly per-
ceived and disapproved of the same “time-notions”
in the doctrine of the Universalists. Such notions
of time interfered only in the way of distracting
attention from that which makes “ eternal Death”
an awful thought to the conscience-stricken sinner.
But this subject assumed a higher importance when
he considered the wider truth to which the doctrine
of Endless Punishment stands related. Not only
does it seem to many believers an impeachment of
God’s Love, but it involved, in his view, a denial of
His Supremacy in His own Universe. The object
of punishment being not purely retributive but re-
medial, it can exist no longer than sin itself. To
assert everlasting punishment is therefore implicitly
to assert the everlastingness of sin, in other words
to say that there may be an everlasting defiance of
God within His own realm. This Mr. Maurice
could not reconcile with St. Paul’s teaching that a
day will come when all enemies of God will be utterly
subdued. Such absolute and universal conquest he
could only identify with the ultimate reconciliation of


all alienated wills. When asked how this hope was
to be realized, he simply said “he could not tell.”
“But,” said he, “I can trust Him who has recon-
ciled the world to Himself. I can leave all in His
hands. I dare not fix any limits to the power of
His Love. I cannot tell what are the limits to the
power of a rebel will. I know that no man can be
blessed except his will is in accordance with God’s
will. I know it must be by action on the will that
Love triumphs.”
.... d 4 • •
In all his profound and devout meditations on
God’s doings among men, here and hereafter, he
he saw “an abyss of Love deeper than the abyss
of death.”
This was the spiritual kind of teaching for which
he was ejected from his Professorship in King’s
College, London, in 1854. Since that time the
highest Court of Appeal has decided that the
opinions thus condemned, may be lawfully held by
any clergyman of our Church. But he accepted the
decision* without a murmur, and though he felt
the keenest pain at the suspicion of heresy that for
a time rested on him, he considered it better that
he should suffer than that the Church should be
torn by a new controversy.
VI. There are some other features of Mr. Mau-
* It was an illegal decision which it was thought he might have disputed if
he had chosen ; for King’s College is a Church of England foundation, and
can have no right to impose on its Professors new tests. Though it was
carried by a narrow majority in the Council, it was disapproved of on this
ground by the most distinguished members of the board, such as the present
Prime Minister of England, and the late sainted Bishop Lonsdale of Lichfield.
Among the majority which condemned him appear such names as those of
the late Lords Radstock and Howe, —no doubt gallant officers and good
Christians, but hardly the men who would have been naturally selected as the
fittest persons to determine the accordance of a Professor’s teaching with the
formularies of the Church. The most ignominious feature of the whole
inquiry was that it was undertaken in consequence of an article which appeared
in the Record newspaper. The persons who coincided in the condemnation
were governed by very different considerations. After the lapse of 18 years
I must adhere to the opinion expressed at the time, in a letter to the Guardian,
that the result was simply “ the synthesis of their several sectarianisms.”


rice’s teaching to which I can only direct attention.
Such, for example, as his doctrine concerning the
Son of Man, not only as a future, but as a living
and a present Judge, in the midst of men. Such
as his doctrine concerning the Sacraments as signs ,
in the deeper meaning of that word with which the
miracles of our Lord have familiarised us. Such
also, as his continual protest against the division
of human life into two uncongenial spheres, the
one secular , the other sacred , —his insistance on the
fact that the Incarnation has made all our life
sacred, and that what God has cleansed we are not
to call common or unclean. How in the light of
this doctrine, he brought his prophetic message to
bear on the experience of political and professional
men, of students, traders, and workers, on the
common occupations and every-day enjoyments of
life, those who know his writings will not need to be
told. Those who do not know them I can only
refer to the books themselves.
But you will not naturally expect that, whatever
else I may omit, I should say something about his
position among the Church parties. He would be
generally classed as a Broad Churchman, but no
term can be more misleading, because none is so
vague. Under that term would be classed with him
men of a sceptical turn of mind, such as the majority
of those who, in “ Essays and Reviews,” some years
since startled the religious world. But between
him and them there was a far wider and more im-
passable gulf than between him and either the
High or Low Church. The disposition to dwell
on Scripture difficulties in the way of detailed facts
or dates or numbers, and to select these as a test
of the truth of Revelation, was foreign to his whole
habit of thought. A public writer* has recently
* In the Spectator, April 6, 1872.


happily described his way of looking, not only on
these but on the more serious moral difficulties
which met him in his reading of Holy Scripture.
His peculiarity was not his disposition to question,
but to find in every new difficulty the suggestion of
some wider truth. He would look at it fairly ; he
would not pretend to explain what he could not ex-
plain ; but he would find in it the suggestion or the
prophecy of some profounder harmony of appa-
rently opposing principles than our present know-
ledge can enable us to perceive. Here the spirit of
Wordsworth pervaded his thought. Where he could
not solve the problem, he would feel himself called
to some new exercise of faith and wonder and ex-
pectation. So keenly was he affected by anything
that seemed to lower the value of Holy Scripture
that, when Bishop Colenso published his first vo-
lumes, he went the length of resigning his In-
cumbency in London, in order that, free from all
suspicion of interested advocacy, he might devote
himself to the work of rescuing bewildered minds
from the misery those publications had caused. To
those who knew him the idea of his interested ad-
vocacy of any cause whatever, could never have
appeared at any time except in the light of a most
humorous fancy. Happily, the ‘interposition of the
present Archbishop of Canterbury, then Bishop of
London, hindered him at the last moment from
carrying his resolution into effect. His love of the
Bible, his absolute faith in it as the utterance of
God’s mind to the world, assumed in his case the
nature of a sacred and absorbing passion. He
could not deal otherwise than charitably with any
men, but the severest tax on his charity was that
made by those who, on merely formal and material
grounds, shook the faith of common Englishmen in
that Book which has kept alive in the nation its


reverence, its love of justice and freedom, its
wholesome and vigorous morality.*
What he did for men of the working-class is a
subject requiring separate treatment. It was, I
think, about 1850 that he, with others of his own
class, pained to the heart by the discovery of evil
and oppression which had grown out of the exces-
sive competition in trade, interfered for the relief
of the distressed workers. But he was met at first
with suspicion on the part of the working men
themselves. Amongst them were men who had
lapsed into unbelief, who hated what they called
“priest-craft” with a deadly hatred; who looked
on the whole class of “ parsons ” as men who said
certain things because they were paid to say them;
and who were little disposed to credit any of their
number who came forward at that crisis with the
power of understanding and sympathising with
them. But he conquered all this opposition by the
sheer force of his personal goodness and his un-
affected humility. The influence he gained over
them was very deep and lasting. And he used it
for the purpose, not only of removing present misery
but of raising them intellectually and morally. He
led them to look for improvement of their condition,
not to altered political arrangements, in quest of
which they had been for years vainly spending their
strength, but in the elevation of their personal life.
The Working Men’s College he created and sus-

* The same spirit of faith showed itself in his passionate protest against
Dean Hansel’s clever demonstration, in his famous Bampton Lectures, of “ the
impossibility of a Christian theology,”—his logical proof of the position that
our only possible knowledge of God is a “ regulative knowledge,” sufficient to
guide us in the present life, but not sufficient to give us an assurance that we
stand really related to the Absolute Source of life. The same turn of mind
which is visible in Mr. Maurice’s teaching about Eternity, is visible here. He
would not let go his hold on eternal truths, without which the present shape
and fashion of our conceptions of God would have been impossible, even if
we cannot reduce them within the dimensions of logical statement.


radiated influences of good the extent of which no
one can pretend to estimate. Among the most pa-
thetic things in the story of his burial at Highgate
Cemetery, was the account of the working men who
there gathered, in seriousness and reverence, around
their benefactor’s grave. Ah, never more will they
look on that beautiful face, which, as I remember it
last, was lighted up in its sad pallour, with a glory
not of this earth. Never more will they hear that
rich expressive voice, which, in the tremulousness
of its pure and strong emotion, seemed to stir the
pulses of feeling in the soul of every listener. And
others beside these men there are who will sorrow-
fully feel that the hope of being so cheered and
strengthened is one which they must now “let alone
for ever.” But his spirit is with us still —aye, even
here at this other end of the earth.
For his glowing words have even in some of our
hearts evoked new springs of energy,—have restored
faith where it was in danger of perishing, and have
given us new hope to go on doing our earthly work
with the certainty that a Father’s blessing rests
on it all, that there is a Father’s heart to which we
can return for forgiveness after every sin, and for
comfort after every disappointment. Yes, his words
are here, still real and living things, straining us
in our individual work to higher endeavour, and
correcting the coldness and narrowness of our
religious life.
His dying words were the fit conclusion of his His Dying
whole career. He did not say, like Hooker whom Words-
he has quoted:—“l go to a world of order,” for
already he had seen more clearly than Hooker,
that even this, in spite of all apparent contra-
dictions of it, is a world of order. But amid the
much unrest that enters into the life of every one
who lives a life above the common standard, he
yet had found a peace in God which passes all


understanding. His last words were of that peace,
not as a thing merely delivering us from the sense
of unrest, but as keeping us in the knowledge and
love of God. In that knowledge and love he had
found the true Eternal Life, and he passed away
from our sight with the assured conviction that
death could not deprive him of it. May God lead
us all, through the same course of blessed self-
renunciation, to the realization of the same perfect
Peace.

NOTE ON EVERLASTING PUNISHMENT.
In his correspondence with Dr. Jelf in 1853, Professor Maurice dealt with the
suggestion that he might be “removing some of those influences which deter
men from crime and encourage them to seek for righteousness.” He said :
“ I do not find that these everlasting torments on which you dwell are brought
home in sermons to the consciences of particular evil-doers. They float
vaguely about in the rhetoric of preachers ; the individual drunkard, adulterer,
gambler, parasite, oppressor, does not in the least perceive that they are
intended for him. In his study the preacher may have settled that they must
apply to such and such persons : when he is brought face to face with them,
he begins to think upon all the influences which may have acted on them from
childhood upwards, to tempt them into evils to which he has never been
tempted : he stammers, mutters dangerous encouragements, and leaves them
to think that they may go on in their dangerous habits, and find some
* uncovenanted mercies ’to help them at last. If they had been told plainly,”
(which was his own manner of dealing with them) “that the state of body
and mind which they have brought on themselves, and in which they may
become fixed, is an accursed damnable state; that from this they need a
present deliverance; that God offers them one; do you think there would
have been nothing in their daily experience, or in their inmost conscience, to
confirm the words ?”
In the same correspondence he tested the value of one of the greatest con-
troversies in the early Church, by the meaning which Dr. Jelf sought to fasten
on the word “ Eternal.” Referring to the doctrine of Athanasius, he says
that in his mind “ the two battles—with Heathenism and with Arianism—
were intimately connected together. He felt that Arius, in attributing notions
derived from Time, to the only-begotten Son, was in fact bringing back the
old divided heathen worship. Athanasius asserted the “ Eternal Generation ”
of the Son—not as a dry dogma, but as a living principle, in which every
child and peasant was interested—certainly not understanding Eternal to
mean endless. If that force is given to it, his doctrine means nothing—every
argument by which he defended it is untenable.” He then proceeds to quote
a curious passage in which Bishop Jeremy Taylor has gone into the whole
subject, showing the variations of opinion in the Early Fathers, and the guards
and modifications with which they upheld the doctrine in question. (Christ’s
Advent to Judgment. Sermon 3).
In that sermon the Bishop distinguishes the particular condemned opinions
of Origen from certain free utterances of other Fathers, which have never been
condemned. For instance : Justin Martyr in his dialogue with Trypho, says,
“ The souls of the godly in a better place, of the wicked in a worse, do tarry
the time of judgment: then they that are worthy shall never die again, but
those that are designed to punishment shall abide so long as God please them
to live and to he punished." “ But,” says Bishop Taylor, “ I observe that the


primitive Doctors were very willing to believe that the mercy of God would
find out a period to the torment of accursed souls.” The “ different fancies ”
prevailing “ very early in the Church ” St. Jerome had collected in a review ot
their “ sentences ”at the end of his commentaries on Isaiah. Irenaeus (Lib.
ii. cap. 65) does not speak of the “torment for ever and ever” as belonging
to all the wicked, but only to “ certain great criminals ” —“ all so long as God
shall please" —“some for ever and ever, and some not so severely;” and
“whereas the general sentence is given to all wicked persons to go into
everlasting fire, it is answered that the fire indeed is everlasting, but not all
that enters into it is everlasting . , . .; though also everlasting signifies
only to the end of its proper period.”
And then the Bishop winds up with his own comment: —“ Concerning this
doctrine of theirs, so severe, and yet so moderated, there is less to be objected
to than against the supposed fancy of Origen ; for it is a strange consideration
to suppose an eternal torment to those to whom it was never threatened,
to those who never heard of Christ, to those that live probably well, to
heathens of good lives, to ignorant and untaught people, to people surprised
in a single crime, to men that die young in their natural follies and foolish
lusts, to them that fall in a sudden gaiety and excessive joy, to all alike;
and that this should be inflicted by God, who infinitely loves His creatures,
who died for them, who pities readily, who pardons easily, and excuses much,
and delights in our being saved, and would not have us to die, and takes
little things in exchange for great. It is certain that God’s mercies are
infinite, and it is also certain that the matter of eternal torments cannot be
truly understood; and when the schoolmen go about to reconcile Divine
Justice to that severity, and consider why God punishes eternally a temporal
sin, or a state of evil, they speak variously, and uncertainly, and unsatis-
fyingly.”
This is the way in which that orthodox and pious Bishop writes on this
awful subject. Perhaps I may add to these illustrations of variations of
opinion among “the primitive doctors,” some reference to variations of
opinion among modem Roman Catholic writers. An article in the
“Christian Remembrancer” (vol. 48) quotes first M. Auguste Nicolas
(Etudes Philos, sur le Christianismc, vol. ii.) He contrasts the universal
reception of this doctrine among the ancients without the pale of Christianity
with the state of feeling which has grown up in recent times : “ Among the
modems, on the contrary, this doctrine has become the most insurmountable,
I do not say to the reason of the unbeliever, but to the faith of the Christian ;
and it is not uncommon to find some who could believe all the rest of
Christianity, who are held in check by this article of faith alone.” So also
the Abbe LeNoir, after citing a number of French writers who “deny the
eternity of the consequences of vice,” admits that “our entire contemporary
literature, so Christian in many points, has this same tendency.” He argues
that the condemnation of Origen, even if there were no doubt about the 15
canons of the sth CEcumenical Council relating to that subject, would not
necessarily imply the formal definition, as an article of faith, of Eternal
Punishment. The Abbe goes on to distinguish between the particular
Origenic view of future punishment condemned, and that which may be held
without contradiction of the faith of the Church :—“ We might, for instance,
hold without falling into condemnation, that bodies, personalities, names,
all these distinctions, shall exist for ever that the pains of hell
will be perpetual, without end, &c.—that is to say will occupy the whole
of it ... . and that thus this evolution will not be eternal absolutely,
because that, this evolution ended, there will be new ones, in which new
causes will determine new effects. If, above all, we were to conciliate with this
theory a reign of Christ which should embrace all the evolutions, it would be
clear that this would not fall under the condemnation of Origen, and that it
would require a recourse to other means, in order to reject it as contrary to
Christian doctrine.”


The same article in the “Christian Remembrancer,” refers to Father
Lacordaire as an eminent Roman Catholic preacher who, while not calling
in question the doctrine of Everlasting Punishment, yet strives to mitigate
its horror by maintaining that there is nothing in the Gospel to show that the
number of the saved will be few. He devotes one of his most eloquent
discourses at Notre Dame to prove that “ the city of tears will be almost a
desert compared with the multitudes which will fill the other cities.”
What is far more important, however, than any variations of opinion among
men, is the testimony of the New Testament on this subject. Those of my
readers who wish to see this calmly and carefully considered, are advised to
read an essay on “Forgiveness after Death,” by the Rev. J. LI. Davies,
appended to'his volume of sermons on “The Manifestation of the Son
of God.”
