Foreword.
This Book of Prayers is issued at
the invitation of several brother
Priests for the use of Soldiers on
Active Service. It contains little of
originality, hut is compiled from
many sources.
Its contents comprise Daily
Prayers, Spiritual Communion, Con-
fession, Special Prayers, and Hymns
for Devotional Use.
I hope it will prove useful to those
for whom it is compiled.
I send it forth in the Name of
the Blessed Trinity.

But deliver us from evil. For

through perils of war, are serving
our Empire on land or on sea, be-
seeching Thee to take into Thine
own hand both us and the cause for
which we are fighting. Be Thou our

0 SAVIOUR of the world, Who
by Thy Cross and Precious Blood


hast redeemed us, save us and help
us, .we humbly beseech Thee, O Lord.
O LAMB OF GOD, that takest
away the sins of the world, have
mercy upon us.
O LAMB OF GOD, that takest

A SOLDIER’S PRAYER.
(On going into Battle.)
ALMIGHTY and Most Merciful
Father, forgive me my sins: Grant
me Thy Peace: Give me Thy power:
Bless me in life and death; for Jesus
Christ’s sake. Amen.


Spiritual Communion.
Sometimes it is altogether impos-
sible to receive the Body and Blood
of Jesus sacramentally, yet we may
receive Him spiritually.
Our last Communion on earth may,
with any of us, have to be a Spiritual
Communion, but where and when the
Blessed Sacrament cannot be had,
Christ does not let His faithful ones
suffer for what is not their fault.
By a Spiritual Communion, or
Communion in desire, the soul par-
takes of the fruit and advantages of
the Blessed Sacrament itself.
AN ACT OF SPIRITUAL COM-
MUNION.
IN THE NAME of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy
Ghost. Amen.
Then say: —
The Lord’s Prayer.






Collect for Purity.
ALMIGHTY GOD, unto Whom
all hearts be open, all desires known,
and from Whom no secrets are hid,
cleanse the thoughts of our hearts by
the inspiration of Thy Holy Spirit
that we may perfectly love Thee, and
worthily magnify Thy holy Name;
through Jesus Christ pur Lord.
Amen.
Make confession of your sins to
Almighty God ( use Confession on
page 38).
Then say this prayer: —
IN UNION, O LORD, with the
faithful at every altar of Thy Church
where Thy Death and Passion are
pleaded before the Father, I desire
now to offer Thee praise and thanks-
giving. I present unto Thee my soul
and body, with the earnest wish that
I may be ever united to Thee. And
since, Lord, I cannot now receive
Thee sacramentally, I beseech Thee
to come spiritually into my heart. I
unite myself to Thee, and embrace


Thee with all the affections of my
soul. O let nothing ever separate me
from Thee, let me live and die in
Thy Love. Amen.
“O come to my heart, Lord Jesus,
There is room in my heart for
Thee.”
Then can he said slowly the hymn:
“Glory be to Jesus” (see page 22),
The Lord’s Prayer,
and the following blessing: —
God the Father, God the Son,
God the Holy Spirit, bless, preserve,
and keep me, and all whom I love
wherever they may be, this day and
for evermore. Amen.


Hymns.
No. 1.
Jesu, Lover of my soul,
Let me to Thy bosom fly;
While the gathering waters roll,
While the tempest still is high;
Hide me, O my Saviour hide,
Till the storm of life is past;
Safe into the haven guide,
O receive my soul at last.
Other refuge have 1 none,
Hangs my helpless soul on Thee;
Leave, ah! leave me not alone,
Still support and comfort me.
All my trust on Thee is stay’d,
All my help from Thee I bring;
Cover my defenceless head
With the shadow of Thy wing.
Plenteous grace with Thee is found,
Grace to cleanse from every sin;
Let the healing streams abound.
Make and keep me pure within.
Thou of Life the Fountain art;
Freely let me take of Thee;
Spring Thou up within my heart,
Rise to all eternity. Amen.


No. 2.
Rock of ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee;
Let the Water and the Blood,
From Thy riven Side which flow’d,
Be of sin the double cure,
Cleanse me from its guilt and power.
Not the labours of my hands
Can fulfil Thy law’s demands;
Could my zeal no respite know,
Could my tears for ever flow,
All for sin could not atone:
Thou must save, and Thou alone.
Nothing in my hand I bring,
Simply to Thy Cross I cling;
Naked, come to Thee for dress;
Helpless, look to Thee for grace;
Foul, I to the Fountain fly;
Wash me, Saviour, or I die.
While I draw this fleeting breath,
When my eyelids close in death,
When I soar through tracts unknown,
See Thee on Thy Judgment Throne;
Rock of ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee.
Amen.


No. 3.
Sun of my Soul, Thou Saviour dear,
It is not night if Thou be near;
O may no earth-born cloud arise
To hide Thee from Thy servant’s
eyes.
When the soft dews of kindly sleep
My wearied eyelids gently steep,
Be my last thought, how sweet to rest
For ever on my Saviour’s breast.
Abide with me from morn till eve,
For without Thee I cannot live;
Abide with me when night is nigh,
For without Thee I dare not die.
If some poor wand’ring child of
Thine
Have spurn’d to-day the voice Divine,
Now, Ford, the gracious work begin;
Fet him no more lie down in sin.
Watch by the sick; enrich the poor
With blessings from Thy boundless
store;
Be every mourner’s sleep to-night
Fike infant’s slumbers, pure and
light.


Come near and bless us when we
wake,
Ere from the world our way we take;
Till in the ocean of Thy love
We lose ourselves in heaven above.
Amen.
No. 4.
Glory be to Jesus,
Who, in bitter pains,
Pour’d for me the Eife-blood
From His sacred veins.
Grace and life eternal
In that Blood I find;
Blest be His compassion
Infinitely kind.
Blest through endless ages
Be the precious stream,
Which from endless torments
Did the world redeem.
Abel’s blood for vengeance
Pleaded to the skies;
But the Blood of Jesus
For our pardon cries.


Oft as it is sprinkled
On our guilty hearts,
Satan in confusion
Terror-struck departs;
Oft as earth exulting
Wafts its praise on high,
Angel-hosts rejoicing
Make their glad reply.
Lift ye then your voices;
Swell the mighty flood;
Louder still and louder
Praise the precious Blood.
Amen.
No. 5.
Hark, my soul! it is the Lord;
’Tis thy Saviour, hear His Word;
Jesus speaks, and speaks to thee,
“Say, poor sinner, lov’st thou Me?”
“I deliver’d thee when bound, ♦
And, when bleeding, heal’d thy
wound;
Sought thee wandering, set thee
right,
Turn’d thy darkness into light.


“Can a woman’s tender care
Cease towards the child she bare?
Yes, she may forgetful be,
Yet will I remember thee.
“Mine is an unchanging love,
Higher than the heights above,
Deeper than the depths beneath,
Free and faithful, strong as death.
“Thou shalt see My glory soon,
When the work of grace is done;
Partner of My Throne shalt be;
Say, poor sinner, lov’st thou Me?”
Ford, it is my chief complaint
That my love is weak and faint;
Yet I love Thee, and adore;
O for grace to love Thee more.
Amen.
No. 6.
ITow sweet the Name of Jesus
sounds
In a believer’s ear!
It soothes his sorrows, heals his
wounds,
And drives away his fear.


It makes the wounded spirit whole,
And calms the troubled breast;
’Tis manna to the hungry soul,
And to the weary rest.
Dear Name! the rock on which I
build
My shield and hiding-place,
My never-failing treasury fill’d
With boundless stores of grace.
Jesus! my Shepherd, Husband,
Friend,
My Prophet, Priest and King,
My Ford, my Fife, my Way, my End,
Accept the praise I bring.
Weak is the effort of my heart,
And cold my warmest thought:
But when I see Thee as Thou art
I'll praise Thee as I ought.
Till then I would thy love proclaim
With every fleeting breath;
And may the music of Thy Name
Refresh my soul in death.
Amen.


No. 7.
I heard the voice of Jesus say:
“Come unto Me and rest;
Lay down, thou weary one, lay down,
Thy head upon My Breast:”
I came to Jesus as I was,
Weary, and worn, and sad;
I found in Him a resting-place,
And He has made me glad.
I heard the voice of Jesus say:
“Behold, I freely give
The living water, thirsty one,
Stoop down, and drink, and live:’
I came to Jesus, and I drank
Of that life-giving stream;
My thirst was quench’d, my soul re
vived,
And now I live in Him.
I heard the voice of Jesus say:
“I am this dark world’s Light!
Look unto Me, thy morn shall rise,
And all thy day be bright!”
I look’d to Jesus, and I found
In Him my Star, my Sun;
And in that Light of Life I’ll walk
Till travelling days are done.
Amen.


No. 8.
Just as I am, without one plea,
But that Thy Blood was shed for me,
And that Thou bidd’st me come to
Thee,
O Lamb of God, I come.
Just as I am, though toss’d about
With many a conflict, many a doubt,
Fightings and fears within, without,
O Lamb of God, I come.
Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind;
Sight, riches, healing of the mind,
Yea, all I need, in Thee to find,
O Lamb of God, I come.
Just as I am, Thou wilt receive,
Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, re-
lieve ;
Because Thy promise I believe,
O Lamb of God, I come.
Just as I am (Thy love unknown
Has broken every barrier down),
Now to be Thine, yea, Thine alone,
O Lamb of God, I come.


Just as I am, of that free love
The breadth, length, depth, and
height to prove,
Here for a season, then above,
O Lamb of God, I come.
Amen.
No. 9.
My God ! my God! and can it be
That I should sin so lightly now,
And think no more of evil thoughts
Than of the wind that waves the
bough ?
I sin, and heaven and earth go round,
As if no dreadful deed were done;
As if Thy Blood had never flowed
To hinder sin or to atone.
I walk the earth with lightsome step,
Smile at the sunshine, breathe the
air,
Do my own will, nor ever heed
Gethsemane and Thy long prayer.
Shall it be always thus, O Lord?
Wilt Thou not work this hour in
me
The grace Thy Passion merited,
Hatred of self, and love of Thee?


O, by the pains of Thy pure love,
Grant me the gift of holy Fear;
And, by Thy Woes and Bloody
Sweat,
O, wash my guilty conscience clear !
Ever when tempted make me see,
Beneath the olives’ moon-pierced
shade,
My God, alone, outstretched, and
bruised,
And bleeding, on the earth He
made.
And make me feel it was my sin,
As though no other sins there were,
That was to Him Who bears the
world
A load that He could scarcely bear.
Amen.
No. 10.
Oh, the bitter shame and sorrow,
That a time could ever be
When I let the Saviour’s pity
Plead in vain, and proudly answer’d,
“All of self, and none of Thee.”


Yet He found me: I beheld Him
Bleeding on the accursed tree,
Heard Him pray, “Forgive them,
Father
And my wistful heart said faintly:
“Some of self, and some of Thee.”
Day by day Flis tender mercy,
Healing, helping, full and free,
Sweet and strong, and ah! so patient,
Brought me lower, while I whisper’d :
“Less of self, and more of Thee.”
Higher than the highest heavens,
Deeper than the deepest sea,
Lord, Thy love at last hath con-
quer’d ;
Grant me now my soul’s desire,
“None of self, and all of Thee.”
Amen.
No. 11.
Take my life, and let it be
Consecrated, Lord, to Thee;
Take my moments and my days,
Let them flow in ceaseless praise.


Take my hands, and let them move
At the impulse of Thy love.
Take my feet, and let them be
Swift and beautiful for Thee.
Take my voice, and let me sing
Always, only, for my King;
Take my lips, and let them be
Filled with messages from Thee.
Take my silver and my gold;
Not a mite would I withhold.
Take my intellect, and use
Every power as Thou shalt choose.
Take my heart, it is Thine Own;
It shall be Thy royal throne.
Take my will, and make it Thine ;
It shall be no longer mine.
Take my love; my Eord, I pour
At Thy Feet its treasure-store.
Take myself, and I will be
Ever, only, all for Thee. Amen.
No. 12.
When I survey the wondrous Cross
On which the Prince of Glory died,
My richest gain I count but loss,
And pour contempt on all my pride.


Forbid it, Ford, that I should boast,
Save in the Cross of Christ my
God;
All the vain things that charm me
most,
I sacrifice them to His Blood.
See from His Head, His Hands, His
Feet,
Sorrow and love flow mingling
down;
Did e’er such love and sorrow meet,
Or thorns compose so rich a
crown ?
Were the whole realm of nature
mine,
That were an offering far too
small;
Fove so amazing, so Divine,
Demands my soul, my life, my all.
To Christ, Who won for sinners
grace
By bitter grief and anguish sore,
Be praise from all the ransom’d race
For ever and for evermore.
Amen.


Special Prayers.
PRAYER OF THE BLESSED
SACRAMENT*

at the Last Supper, didst bequeath to
the Church a perpetual Memorial of
The Sacrifice of The Cross; and

earnest down from Heaven, to give

in Thy Strength, and inherit Thy
Joy, Who livest and reignest, God,
world without end. Amen.
FOR THE HOLY SPIRIT.
GIVE ME Thy holy Spirit, O God,
that, forsaking my sins, I may love
Thee more, and serve Thee better
every hour; through Jesus Christ our
Lord. Amen.

danger, midst shot and shell, and

leaders find in Thee; for Jesus
Christ’s sake. Amen.


FOR THE LONELY.

the loneliness of Thy suffering upon
the Cross, be nigh unto all those who
are desolate in pain or sorrow; and
let Thy presence transform their
loneliness into comfort, and holy
fellowship with Thee, Lord Jesus,
Thou pitiful Saviour. Amen.
FOR SICK AND WOUNDED.
HAVE MERCY, O Lord, upon all
the wounded and suffering. Let Thy
grace be their comfort, although
natural friends be far away. Raise
them to health, if it be good; but
chiefly give them such faith and pa-
tience' that they may glorify Thee
upon earth, and escaping safe from
the assaults of Satan, may rest in
peace and arise to partake of Thy
glory; through Jesus Christ our
Lord. Amen.


FOR THE DYING.
LORD JESUS CHRIST, Who in
Thy last agony didst commend Thy
Spirit into the hands of Thy Heaven-
ly Father, have mercy upon all sick
and dying persons, and grant that
they may omit nothing which is ne-
cessary to make their peace with
Thee before they die. Grant this, O
Lord, our Strength and our Re-
deemer. Amen.
GRANT, O LORD, I beseech
Thee, that if in battle I am called to
see my comrade fall at my side, 1
may remember, and strongly believe,
that he cannot fall outside the reach
of the arms of Thy love, and may
fight the more bravely for the Cause
for which he has made the Great
Surrender. I pray this for His merits
Who gave His Life for me. Amen.
WHEN SICK OR WOUNDED,
O SAVIOUR, look with love and
pity upon me Thy servant. Have
mercy upon me, and help me to hear
mv sickness (or my wounds) pa


tiently. Be ever with me and sup-
port my weakness. Bless and sanc-
tify every pain, and enable me,
through suffering, to learn to love
thee more and more. If it be Thy
gracious will, restore me to health
ana strength, that 1 may yet again
serve my country, and evermore
glonly Thy Holy Name. Amen.
THANKSGIVING FOR RECOVERY.
O MOST GRACIOUS GOD, Who
hast m Ihy great mercy restored me
to health and lengthened my days
upon the earth, grant that I may de-
vote tne life which Thou hast spared
entirely to Thy service. Let me never
neglect hy loving mercies, and grant
that 1 may henceforth live as a faith-
lul soldier of the Cross and of the
King, and serve Thee day by day;
for Thy dear Son’s sake, Jesus Christ
our Cord. Amen.


Confession.
Prepare yourself carefully by ask-
ing for recollectedness,and having
yourself in the presence of Jesus
Christ your Saviour,
Say:-
In the name of the Father, and
of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.
Amen.
Think how much it cost the Eternal
God to take away your Sins —even
the blood of Jesus Christ, His Son.
Think how He suffered in the
Garden of Gethsemane. How His
sweat, like great drops of blood, fell
to the ground.
Think how He was betrayed and
dragged to judgment \ was cruelly
scourged, spit upon, and beaten.
Think how He was unjustly con-
demned and crucified. His hands
and feet were nailed to the Cross
with cruel blows, and remember that
it was your sins that caused them.
His head was crowned with thorns.
His tongue was parched with thirst.


His eyes were blinded with blood and
tears. His side was pierced with the
spear of the soldier.
He suffered all this for your sins.
He is looking at you now, and is
tenderly calling you to be washed in
His blood.
“O Lord, I give myself to Thee,
Thine ever, only Thine to be.”
O SAVIOUR OF THE WORLD,
Who by Thy Cross and Precious
Blood hast redeemed us, save us and
help us, we humbly beseech Thee, O
Lord.
COME, HOLY SPIRIT, teach
me my sins, and the state of my
life in Thy sight. Give me the will
to be sorry for my sins and a firm
purpose not to sin again. Come,
holy Spirit, fill my heart with the fire
of Thy love, . .
Now tell God your sins one by
one: make a clean breast of every-
thing: using the Confession on page 8.
m When you have confessed your
sins , say: —
For these and all my other sins,
which I cannot now remember, I am


very sorry, and I firmly resolve not
to sin again, and humbly ask pardon
of God.
Then say: —
0 my God, I offer Thee my con-
fession; accept it for Jesus’ sake;
pardon all that Thou hast seen amiss
in it, and supply all that is wanting in
me. Help my weakness in the future,
and suffer me not again to fall into
my past sins; through Jesus Christ
our Saviour. Amen.
Then say the Lord’s Prayer.
1 will go forth in the strength of
the Lord God, and will make men-
tion of Thy righteousness only.
N .B.—lfyou are not by
means of self-examination and con-
fession to God, to quiet your con-
science, and require further comfort,
or counsel, do not hesitate to go to
your Chaplain or Parish Priest, and
open your trouble to him: that by the
ministry of God’s Holy Word you
may receive the benefit of absolution,
together with spiritual counsel and
advice.
