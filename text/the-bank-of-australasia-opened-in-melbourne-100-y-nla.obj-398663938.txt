THE FIRST PREMISES IN COLLINS ST.. MELBOURNE
MELBOURNE BUILDING BEFORE
REMODELLING
aHE first home of the bank, in Melbourne a two-
roomed brick cottage 24 feet by 16 feet was
situated on the North side of Little Collins Street,
between Elizabeth and Queen Streets. The cottage
stood several feet in from the street line and was
surrounded by a substantial paling fence. An armed military
sentinel supplied by the Government guarded the Bank,
while two huge mastiffs, housed by day in the back yard,
were let loose at night.
In 1840 a site opposite the Customs House and Market
Place was purchased with a frontage of 50 feet to Collins
Street, and a stone two-storey building was completed bv
August of that year. So rapid was the growth of the business,
however, that the adjoining block on the West side was bought
in 1852, and the “largest telling room in the Colony, sixty
feet by forty feet” was added. The back of this building,
with windows iron barred, overlooked Bank Place.
On 23rd June, 1858, the present site, which had previously
formed portion of a block granted to the Wesleyan Church,
was purchased, and in 1876 a beautiful stone building, which
served the Bank for over halt a century, was completed.
This two-storey building, for long one of the architectural
features of Melbourne, was designed by Messrs. Reid and
Barnes, architects of Melbourne. The late Mr. Anketell M.
Henderson was Chief Draughtsman to that firm, and later
was the Bank's Architect for many years. When the building
was remodelled in 1929 his son, Mr. Kingsley A. Henderson,
C.M.G., was the Architect.

MELBOURNE
HAVI!) CHARTERIS McARTHUR was a son of
Captain Donald McArthur, a distinguished Pen-
insular Officer who was stationed at St. Helena
when Napoleon Bonaparte was in exile there.
Born in 1810, Mr. I). C. McArthur joined the service of
the Bank in Sydney in 1835 and was selected to open the
first Bank in Melbourne in 1838.
Appointed Superintendent of the Bank in 1867, Mr.
McArthur retired from that position in 1876, when he became
a Director ami held that office until his death on 15th
November, 1887.
Mr. McArthur was one of the first Trustees of the Botanical
Gardens, took an active part in founding the Mechanics In-
stitute now the Athenaeum floated the first loan on
behalf of the Corporation of the City of Melbourne the
Gabrielli Loan helped to found the first Roads Board,
played in the first Cricket Match in Victoria, and was later
President of the Melbourne Cricket Club.
Of the many other offices which Mr. McArthur held, the
Presidency of the Public Library, Chairmanship of the
Trustees Executors and Agency Co. Ltd., and Directorship
of the North British and Mercantile Insurance Co. Ltd., were
perhaps the most important.
David Chatteris McArthur is referred to by Historians as
the Patriarch of Victorian Banking: and he also took his full
part in furthering the interests of his fellow citizens.

100 years of Banking Progress
in Melbourne
1838—1938
IRON CHEST BROUGHT FROM
SYDNEY CONTAINING THE
BANK'S SPECIE
SHE Bank of Australasia opened in Sydney in
December, 1835, and in January of the following
year, established Branches in Hobart and Laun-
ceston. Extension to Port Phillip was planned to
follow some years later. This move was hastened
by a request from Sir Richard Bourke, Governor of New
South Wales. Mr. I). C. McArthur accordingly left for Port
Phillip in the Government Cutter “Ranger” on Saturday,
30th June, 1838, with an iron chest containing £3,000 in
British silver coin.
The “Ranger” arrived in Hobson’s Bay from Sydney “after
a long and tempestuous voyage” of six weeks. After con-
ferring with the Administrator, Captain Lonsdale, Mr.
McArthur opened for business on 28th August, 1838, in
temporary premises in Little Collins Street.
The aspect of the future city was as primitive as the Bank
premises. Collins Street was full of the stumps of gum trees
that had previously flourished there, and Elizabeth Street was
the bed of a creek.
The year of removal to Collins Street 1840 synchronised
with the beginning of a period of financial stress. It was the
era known as the “hungry forties” when wool slumped and
trade and commerce suffered a severe setback. With the
discovery of gold, however, the whole outlook and tenor of
business were transformed, thousands of men being attracted
to the Colony a cosmopolitan crowd of every type. The
early years of gold fever were succeeded by a period of steady
progress, and it was at this time, in 1859, that the office of
the Superintendent for Australia, and later on New Zealand,
was transferred from Sydney to Melbourne.
For a quarter of a century development proceeded steadily,
with the occasional checks caused by unfavourable seasons.
Sales of property in Melbourne and Suburbs increased tre-
mendously leading to an enormous amount of speculation in
city and suburban land. Then in 1888 came the silver boom
and the fever of speculation reached its peak, only to be
followed by the collapse of the land boom in the tragic year
of 1893, when the huge bubble burst and thousands faced
ruin.

100 Years of Banking Progress
in Melbourne
MAIN ENTRANCE TO MELBOURNE
HEAD OFFICE
EARING a general collapse, the Government of the
day in Victoria took the unprecedented step of
issuing a proclamation declaring a Bank Holiday
for live days. The Bank of Australasia, however,
in the interests of their customers and the com-
munity, decided not to avail of this measure and continued
to pay their depositors on demand. This courageous and
prompt action did much to restore confidence in Australia
both here and overseas.
Recovery from the effects of the 1893 crisis which involved
much hardship on many people took years to accomplish.
Just as the Bank had helped to check the panic in 1893, so
it continued to play its part in the gradual restoration of
trade and commerce to a new plane of prosperity. During
the critical war years, when hundreds of millions were required
for war purposes, and commerce and industry had to be assisted
to the utmost, and in the recent World-wide depression,
The Bank of Australasia in conjunction with the Common-
wealth Bank of Australia and the other trading banks, again
faced its responsibilities in a manner which added to its
prestige.
In the latter part of the post-war period, the remodelling
of the Melbourne premises was begun. This was rendered
necessary by the continued expansion of business. With the
exception of the four external walls, the building was entirely
demolished and rebuilt. So successfully was this carried out,
that nothing was lost of the austere dignity that makes the
structure one of the most notable buildings in Melbourne.
The contrast between that two-roomed cottage in Little
Collins Street and the present building of the Chief Office
in Melbourne, and between that iron chest and the modern
strong rooms of to-day, gives perhaps the best illustration of
the hundred years’ progress of The Bank of Australasia in
Melbourne.
