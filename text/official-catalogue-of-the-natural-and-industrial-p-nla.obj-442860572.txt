TIN.
The approximate area of the tin fields in New South Wales is 8,500
square miles. According to the official report of Harrie Wood, Esq.,
Under Secretary for Mines, the value of the total production of tin to the


Class 43 —continued.
end of 1877 amounts to £2,375,950. The tin ore therefore ranks next in
importance to gold and coal as a source of wealth to the Colony. The
number of miners engaged in raising ore in 1876 was 1,651, and the earnings
of each miner is estimated to be £152 15s. 9d., which is considerably greater
than the average earnings of gold-miners. The ore is at present chiefly
obtained from alluvial deposits, but doubtless the lodes (of which several
have been discovered) will ere long be worked, and the annual production
will be thereby largely increased. The existence of tin in New South
Wales was known for many years, but it was not until 1871 that any
attempt was made to turn this mineral to account as a marketable com-
modity. The most extensive deposits of ore have been found in the north-
ern portion of the Colony, but tin has also been discovered in other districts.
The value of the tin obtained in 1872 was £17,703, in 1873 the value
amounted to £334,436, and in 1877 to £508,540, the total value of the
production to that date being £2,375,950. The ore has hitherto been
obtained in the beds of water-courses, and it is separated from the soil by
sluicing. In some localities extremely rich deposits of drift tin have been
found in the beds of ancient streams, at a depth from 60 to 80 feet below
the surface; but it more frequently happens that the overlying soil is only
a very few feet in thickness. Valuable lodes or reefs have also been dis-
covered, and in some places crushing machinery has been erected to extract
the ore. The profits of tin-mining have been greatly diminished by the
reduced price of the metal consequent upon the large additional supply
obtained from the Australian fields. The tin-bearing granites of New South
Wales belong to the same geological era as those of Derwent and Cornwall.
Warden Buchanan reports that many years will elapse before the ground
now being worked will be exhausted, and says that he is convinced that the
tin fields open a wide scope for the employment of the labouring classes.
The tin ores exhibited in the New South Wales Court are very numerous,
and show all the different forms in which this mineral has been found in the
Colony.

show that they contain from 9 to 49 per cent, of metal, and that
the copper is not unfrequently associated with gold, silver, lead, and sulphur.
The production of copper has increased in value from £1,400, in 1858, to
£307,181, in 1877. Numerous characteristic specimens and some large
blocks of copper ore, also about 25 tons of metallic copper in ingots are
exhibited. The approximate area of cupriferous country in New South

IRON.
Important deposits of iron ore are found in close proximity to coal and lime-
stone in several parts of the Colony. Furnaces, rolling-mills, &c., have
recently been erected for the conversion of pig iron into malleable iron ; and
it is expected that the demand for iron in the Colony will be supplied by
metal locally produced. Haematite, magnetic, chrome, and other iron ores
are shown in the mineral collection. The ore found at Mittagong, in the
Southern district, contains about 66 per cent, of iron. Speaking of the
deposits of iron ore at Wallerawang, Professor Liversidge says —“ They contain
two varieties of iron—magnetite, or the magnetic oxide of iron, and the brown
haematite or goethite —the hydrated oxide ; then in addition to these there
are deposits of the so-called clay bands which are interstrati fled with the coal
measures. These clay bands are not what are usually known as clay iron
ores in England. They are brown haematites, var. limonite, while the English
clay iron ores are impure carbonates of iron, which seldom contain much
more than 30 per cent, of metallic iron, against some 50 per cent, contained
by the haematites. A highly ferruginous garnet accompanies the veins of
magnetite; this garnet is very rich in iron, and it will probably be found
advantageous to smelt it with the other ores, not only on account of the large
percentage of metal which it contains, but also on account of the increased
fluidity it would impart to the slag.” The approximate area of iron ore
deposits is 1,400 square miles. The value of the iron raised to 1877 amounts
to £30,197.

ANTIMONY, LEAD, AND SILVER.
Samples of antimony ore from various localities, and half a ton of Star
Antimony of fine quality are exhibited. The value of the antimony raised
to 1877 amounts to £7,168. Hitherto hut little attention has been devoted
to the development of the antimony lodes ; but it is believed that this
branch of mining will become of considerable importance. The value of the
silver raised in 1877 amounted to £6,673, the total value of the production to
that date being £112,139. G-alena, sulphuret of lead, is of common occur-
rence throughout the mining districts of New South Wales, but the lodes
hitherto discovered have not been profitably worked.

GOLD.
The weight of gold obtained to the end of 1877 was 8,725,119 - 68
ounces, of the value of £32,486,332 Os. 7d. Except in some few localities,
quartz veins have not been worked to a great depth, and the auriferous
resources of the Colony have scarcely been touched. Alluvial lands have in
some instances been worked to a depth of 200 feet, and there are the strong-
est indications of deep leads in various parts where no attempt has been
made to work them. Gold-mining, as hitherto carried on, has been princi-
pally confined to the working of river beds and shallow alluvial claims.
Extensive areas of country are known to be auriferous, and there is still
ample scope for the remunerative employment of a large population in both
alluvial and quartz mining. The poor success which has often attended the
working of quartz veins is largely attributable to ill-judged speculation,
inexperience, and the absence of proper ore-separating and other mining
appliances. The Eev. W. B. Clarke, referring to a recent visit to the
Western district, says that he “ passed over many miles of country in which
the rocks that belong to a golden area yet remain in their original condition,
and will so remain until some fortunate adventurer stumbles by accident on
a tangible encouragement.” Thirty-three samples of gold from the
Northern, Southern, and Western Gold Fields, rich specimens of auriferous
quartz from the “Star of Peace” and other mines, and a model representing
the total production of gold in New South Wales, are shown in the
Exhibition.


Class 43 —continued.
The approximate area included within the proclaimed Gold Fields is
35,500 square miles ; hut from the geological formation of the country, it is
believed that the area in which payable gold deposits will be found will be
greater than that now stated. The returns from the alluvial mines show that
the average yield from the wash-dirt was 1 dwt. 23T4 grs. of gold per ton ;
and from the quartz mines the average yield of the crushings gave 13 dwts.
B’2o grs. per ton. From some of the reefs at Hill End, crushings gave at
the rate of from 30 to 2,100 ounces of gold per ton ; specimens of gold in
quartz from this locality are exhibited. It is known that much gold passes
away in the tailings, and is lost in consequence of the imperfect appliances
at present employed for the treatment of auriferous pyrites.

the yield from this quartz has been very large, yet, owing
to the presence of pyrites and other associated minerals,
much of the gold is lost by the saving appliances at
present used; this has been proved by the yield from the
tailings which were sent to England for treatment.

COAL.
The approximate area of the carboniferous strata is estimated at 23,950
square miles. The principal coal beds exist along the coast to the north
and south of Sydney. The mines first opened are situate in the immediate
vicinity of Newcastle, and it is from there that the Colony obtains its
largest supply. The coal lies near the surface, and the greatest depth to
which shafts have yet been sunk is less than 500 feet. In many districts
the coal crops out on the face of the hills, and can be cheaply got by driving
tunnels. The cost of mining is from 3s. to ss. 6d. per ton. The coal-
shipping facilities at Newcastle are by staiths and steam cranes, whose total
loading capabilities have been increased to 12,300 tons per diem. Experi-
ments with the New South Wales coal at the Eoyal Arsenal Woolwich, in
1858 and 1859 showed that for steam purposes it was only 7 per cent,
inferior to the best Welsh coal; and that, as regards the manufacture of
gas, it produces upwards of 9,000 feet per ton, with an illuminating power
24 per cent, greater than the English variety known at Whitworth. The
Government Director of the Indian Eailway Companies, in his Eeport to the
Secretary of State for India (1868-9), refers to the quality of Australian
coal. He says : “It has been tried on some of the lines of Western India,
and has been well reported on. The experience of the Locomotive Superin-
tendent of the Scinde Co. is that it is equal to Welsh coal in all respects ;
its evaporation power is nearly equal to Welsh coal, and the consumption
per mile is less. The price hitherto has been under that of English Welsh
coal.” The Government Examiner of Coal Fields (Mr. John Mackenzie,
E.G.S.) estimates that one seam of coal, after allowing one-third for loss
and waste in getting, will yield 84,208,298,667 tons. It has been ascertained
by the Eev. W. B. Clarke and the Examiner of Coal Fields that there are
in the upper coal measures at least sixteen seams of coal, each more than 3
feet thick. One seam whose out-crop is near Stroud, described by the late
Mr. W. Keene, is more than 30 feet thick, as tested by several trial pits
sunk on the dip side ; and another, whose outcrop is near Wallerawang,
recently examined by Archibald Liversidge, Esq., Professor of Geology in
the University of Sydney, is 17 feet 6 inches thick. The principal seam
from which coal is now being obtained is from 8 to 10 feet thick, the coal
being free-burning and bituminous, —suitable for household, steam, smelting,
gas, and blacksmith’s purposes. Mr. E. W. Moody, mining engineer, gives


Class 43 —continued.
the following description of coal land on the south-eastern coast: —“ The
five seams of coal contained in this 600 acres will yield 31,250,000 tons of
coal, which will supply a vend of 1,000 tons a day for over 100 years ; and this is
independent of the exceedingly rich bed of kerosene oil shale, wdiich is suffi-
cient to yield 2,000 gallons of refined oil per week for over seventy-two
years. The position of all the seams is so favourably situated that the coal
from each can be got by tunnelling into the mountain range, and conveyed
to the proposed railway terminus below by self-acting inclined planes.’
Writing of the upper coal measures in the Western district, the Govern-
ment Geologist (C. S. Wilkinson, Esq., L.S., F.G.S.) says: “They are 480
feet thick, resting conformably on the marine beds of the lower coal
measures, and overlaid by more than 500 feet of Hawkesbury sandstone.
Eleven seams of coal have been counted in them; the lowest, which is 10
feet thick, lies about 25 feet above the marine beds, and is the same seam
■worked by the Bowenfels, Eskbank, Lithgow Valley, and Yale of Clwydd
Collieries. This seam of coal crops out on the surface on the railway line
near Bowenfels. It dips at a low angle of 3to 5 degrees to the north-east,
and is therefore easily worked ; and as it passes under the vast extent of
mountain ranges to the north and east, it will be inexhaustible for genera-
tions to come.” The production of coal has increased very rapidly of late
years. In 1833, 328 tons were raised, and in 1877, 1,389,871 tons, the
value of the last-named year’s production being £832,225 13s. Nearly
900,000 tons were exported to the other Australian Colonies and New
Zealand, to China, Japan, and India, Mauritius, New Caledonia, and San
Erancisco. Several seams of cannel coal have been found, and the produce
of two of them is retorted for the -manufacture of kerosene oil. Their
thickness varies from 2to 5 feet. The Hartley shale yields 160 gallons of
crude oil, or 18,000 cubic feet of gas per ton, with an illuminating power
equal to forty caudles. The total production of coal to December 31st, 1877,
was 17,426,797 tons, of the value of £9,110,283 15s. Bd., and of petroleum oil
shale 137,299 tons, of the value of £371,432 10s. Sections of the coal seams
worked in the Northern, Western, Southern, and Hunter River Coal Fields
are exhibited, and also samples from several of the seams of petroleum oil
coal.

BUILDING STONES.
Almost every variety of building stone may be obtained in New South
Wales. In and around the city of Sydney there are numerous quarries in the
sandstone of the Hawkesbury formation, which is one of the upper members
of the Carboniferous group. This sandstone, which, for colour and texture
can hardly be surpassed for building purposes, is the stone most commonly
used in the construction of the public and private buildings in Sydney.
Extensive deposits of marble, of Silurian and Devonian ages, occur in several
places in the Colony. The black variety from the Marulan, and the white
from the Cow Elat Marble Quarries, have been used in flooring the Great
Hall of the Sydney University. The marble near Wallerawang is thus
described by Mr. C. S. Wilkinson, L.S., E.G.S., Government Geologist, on
his geological survey map of the Wallerawang and Bowenfels District:—
“ Thick beds of coralline limestone of very pure quality. It forms a
compact marble of various tints, white, cream, and dove-coloured, and
sometimes with pink markings. It dresses well, takes an excellent
polish, and may be obtained in blocks of almost any required size
and quantity. Situated as it is, only 7 miles from the Wallerawang
Eailway Station, it will be available for the Iron-smelting Works
in the district, and will afford a source of large supply for the
Sydney market. The limestone consists almost entirely of corals—
Eavosites gothlandica, Eavosites polymorpha, Lithostrotion, and
others, and mollusks as yet undetermined.”
Granite occurs in great abundance, and in every variety of texture and
colour; it is used in Sydney for building and decorative purposes.

PRODUCTS OF THE CULTIVATION OF FORESTS, &c.
1. Tree Perns. New South Wales Commissioners.
No. 1. Alsophila australis.
This species is more or less abundant in sheltered situations within the
coast districts of the Colony, extending inland about 50 miles. It is the
most abundant of any of its class, and in the Blue Mountain Ranges it
reaches a height of from 50 to 60 feet. Prom its stem vases and drinking
cups are occasionally made by the colonists.
No. 2. DicJcsonia antarctica.
This species has a wide range, inhabiting similar situations to the former ;
extends in a more southerly direction than that species, but does not reach
so far north. In habit it is more slender than the same species in Victoria
or Tasmania, but it attains to a greater height in New South Wales than in
the other Australian Colonies.
No. 3. Alsophila macarthuri.
This species is not of such general occurrence as either of the two pre-
ceding, nor does it extend so far south. In appearance it is very beautiful
and graceful; in some situations the stems attain to a height of from 20 to
25 feet, and diameter about 4 inches ; with fronds from 12 to 15 feet.
No. 4. Alsophila cooperii.
This species is comparatively rare, though abundant in some places. It
attains to a considerable height, and, like the preceding species, its stem is
slender and fronds large. It is the most easily cultivated of any indigenous
species in the Colony, and is very closely allied to Alsophilo excelsa, a native
of Norfolk Island.
The specimens sent of these four species are sufficiently large to illustrate
their character, and will give to the stranger a good idea of this class of
New South Wales vegetation.

Hab. The whole of Australia from Victoria to Queensland, as far
north as Heorge Town.
It has long since been proven that neither of these peculiar animals lay
eggs. The young are born in the ordinary manner, but before they are fully
developed; the mouth is, however, sufficiently developed to perform the
action of suction; the young are placed on the milk areola (there is no real
nipple) by the mother. In the Echidna the areola is an indentation in the
skin, in the Platypus a flat surface. Both have been found in Queensland,
the Echidna as far north as Cape York. The young Echidnse attain to
nearly the full size of the adult before they become spined.

SILK.
Many varieties of the silkworm have been acclimatised in New South
Wales, and the ailanthus and the mulberry trees have become general. The
experience which has been gained indicates that the Colony possesses every
climatic advantage requisite for the production of silk.

WOOL.
Much of the progress of New South Wales is due to the suitability of
the climate for the production of fine wool, and the pastoral industry still
contributes more largely to the support of manufactures and the extension
of commerce than any other. The narrow tract lying between the sea and
the mountains is better adapted for depasturing long coarse-woolled sheep,
and there the Lincoln, Leicester, and Cotswold breeds are found. The table-
lands and western plains are almost wholly stocked with merinos and Saxon
merinos, descended from the flocks of Germany, France, and Spain. The
process of acclimatisation has modified the type of the Spanish merino.
There has been a decided gain in the softness of the wool and an improve-
ment in its elasticity; but, while it has increased in length, it has diminished
in density, so that the weight of the fleece remains about the same. The
increase of the merino sheep has been great and continuous; and, having much
variety of soil and climate, New South Wales can produce in perfection all
the kinds of wool which manufacturers may require, from the very finest
clothing to the long silky lustrous combing wool now so much in demand.
Nearly one-half of the total number of sheep in Australia are depastured
within the limits of New South Wales; and the average weight of washed
wool per fleece is from 2f lbs. to 3 lbs. One hundred samples of wool are
shown in the New South Wales Court at the Paris Exhibition. The limit of
possible production has not yet been reached. The increase has been three-
fold during the last decade ; and an experienced pastoralist estimates that,
with favourable seasons and a continuance of remunerative prices for wool
in the English market, the flocks of New South Wales ten years hence will
reach an aggregate of from forty to fifty millions. Official returns of live
stock shovr that on the 31st March, 1877, there were 366,703 horses,
3,131,013 horned cattle, and 21,503,388 sheep. The Customs returns for
1876 show that the exports of the principal pastoral products —wool, live
stock, preserved meats, hides, and leather—amounted in value to nearly seven
millions and a half sterling.

ALIMENTARY AND OTHER PRODUCTS.
Among the vegetable products and manufactures exhibited at Paris are
wheat and flour, maize and maizena, arrowroot, sugar, oranges, and other
preserved fruits. All the different branches of husbandry followed in
Europe may be carried on under equally favourable conditions in New South
Wales, and some parts of the Colony are fitted for the growth of semi-
tropical products. Snow is of rare occurrence, excepting on the Southern


Class 69 —continued.
Alps and occasionally on the mountain plateaux; and, viewing the country
as a whole, there are few localities in which it is absolutely necessary that
live stock should be housed, or that special provision should be made to feed
them during the winter months. One of the chief hindrances to agriculture
has lain in the cost of transporting produce from lands in the interior to the
seaboard. Railways have now been made to the verge of the districts con-
sidered most suitable for the growth of cereals; and additional impetus is
therefore being given to the cultivation of the soil. The average production
of wdieat is about 20 bushels to the acre, and of maize about 30 bushels;
GO lbs. to 64 lbs. per bushel are not unusual weights for wheat, and from GO
lbs. to G 6 lbs. for maize. As the roots of large trees are suffered to remain
in the ground, the yield per acre over a large area of only partly cleared
land must be proportionately less than in older countries, Avhere the whole
available surface is brought under tillage. In exceptionally fertile soils, 120
bushels of maize have been obtained as a first crop, and with good farming,
an average of 60 bushels per acre can be secured on first class soils. The
cultivation of the sugar-cane is comparatively a new industry. It has been
entered upon on the northern rivers, and on the Clarence one Company has
established three mills, having an aggregate manufacturing capacity of 7,000
tons during the season. The produce of the crop for 1877 amounted to
10,523,520 lbs. Cotton has been grown, but has not proved remunerative;
and while a large extent of country is suitable for the growth of tobacco,
the manufacture of the home grown leaf is not sufficiently well understood
to enable the agriculturist to supersede the importation of foreign grown
leaf, which brings the highest prices in the Australian markets. Fruit trees
of many descriptions grow well in New South Wales, and the market of
Sydney is well supplied with apples, pears, plumbs, nectarines, peaches,
apricots, currants (imported from Tasmania), cherries, grapes, oranges, lemons,
bananas, figs, quinces, guavas, strawberries, mulberries, almonds, walnuts, &c.,
pineapples and other fruits. All the vegetables most esteemed in Europe
are cultivated with success in New South Wales; The value of oranges
exported exceeded £50,000 per annum ; and there is a large extent of country
in which the cultivation of this fruit has been most successful. The export
of maize in 1876 was 594,303 bushels ; and of wheat and flour the balance of
imports over exports was of the value of £467,856. The extent of land
under cultivation on the 31st of March, 1876, was 513,840 acres.

WINE.
There is scarcely a district in which the grape-vine does not flourish; and
there is reason to suppose that the production of wine will become one of the
great industries of the Country. Dr. Lindemann remarks “ The soil and
climate of many parts of New South Wales are eminently adapted to
viticulture ; from the Murray in the south to the Clarence in the north there
are few places where the vine will not flourish, yielding wines in great
variety and of rare quality. Many of the wines grown on the Murray are
rich and alcoholic, surpassing in these qualities the wines of Portugal; while
others, with their soft luscious fulness and delicate flavour, rival the first
growths of the far-famed Constantly Again, the wines grown upon the Hunter
and more northern rivers are light, dry, and fragrant, bearing close resem-
blance to the sauternes, clarets, and burgundies of France. And there can
be little doubt that the produce of the vine in the not very distant future
will become a valuable export.” The quality of the manufacture has steadily
improved. The produce for 1877 was 799,709 gallons, and the total produce
of the vineyards would include about 3,000 gallons of brandy and upwards of
1,000 tons of fruit for home consumption and export to the adjoining Colonies.
