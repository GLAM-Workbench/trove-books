Souvenir of_
H. M. A. X. " KANOWNA."
A FOREWORD.
I have been asked to write a foreword to
the Souvenir of the voyage of the Kanowna,.
I do so with pleasure, because I, like most
people, delight in souvenirs and mementos.
A souvenir is a thing giveii, kept; etc,, to
remind one of the persons or occasions.
Some people, like the Americans, have a
mania for collecting souvenirs. Most
people in love try to steal a lock of liftir
from the head Of their adored one to wor-
ship when they are parted, it is well to
label the lock of hair, for women's hair
changes in the course of years, or less —
either naturally or artificially-—and then if
there is no label how can a man remember
to whom the special lock belongs.
This Souvenir is to remind us of a long
journey, with its vicissitudes —days of plea-
sure, and perhaps days of weariness. It
is a merciful dispensation of Providence
that in after years we remember pleasure
more keenly than pain—and even remem-
brance of pain and suffering and dangers
through which we have passed may give
us pleasure.
I hope that in the future there will be
much to remember about this trip which
may be delightful'—perhaps health renewed
and strength brought back; perhaps some
friendship formed with a companion which
may last for life; perhaps the souvenir of
such a companionship may be a- little gold
ring. Who knows?
May I express a hope that when you
arrive at the dear spot you call home, all
may be well.

"HOWEWARD BOUND."
There are two events which will always
hold a prominent place in the mind of each
member of the A.T.F. One is his first de-
parture from, Australia on active service;
the other, his return home. At some time
or other on the homeward voyage it must
have come to most men to compare it with
the outward one. Then they left in com-
plete batteries, (battalions, and companies.
Strong courage, firm wills did not prevent
heavy" hearts. It was; a great adventure,
and the end for each, no man could fore-
see. They were comrades' who had spent
some time together in camps training for
what they knew was going to prove a
stern task. Then came all the many and
varied experiences which no pen, can depict,
and now they 1 are on their way home again,
the task having ended in victory. But how
different to, that first journey! No longer
are there, any complete units; no battalion,
battery, or company but has left some, if
not most, of its members on Galli;poli,
France, Flanders, and everywhere else
where battles raged. They have become
sadly accustomed to see or hear of com-
rades whom, they knew so well paying the
great price, but as they remember how
(bravely they fought, and how heroically
they died, their hearts are sore at their
loss, but proud that such men were their
comrades.
To-day the roll of each boat, carrying
members of the A.I.F. back to Australia
represents every section of that Force, and
every State in the Commonwealth —iso-
lated representatives of those other com-
plete units of which they formed a, part. To
the memory of all those who left home, but
will never return thence, devout tribute is
here paid. Their reward lies in the good
hands of the God of Battles. To have come
safely through should arouse deep grati-
tude in the heart of each survivor. No
army engaged in the war has borne more
hardship, won higher honour, gained
greater fame than that which bears the
glorious title "Anzac" —the term, as here
used is intended to comprise all men of the
Australian and New Zealand Forces who
have been on active, service—and l no- word
will go d'own to posterity more pregnant
with imperishable glory, nor stir the souls
of generations yet unborn than this which
the soul of Anzac (General 1 Birdwood) gave
to the Bay and; soil made sacred by the
rich red: blood which was shed there in the
holy cause of Freedom. No one is better
able nor more ready to pay highest tribute
to the unquenchable courage and uncon-
querable spirit of all his; comrades in arms',
of whichever Allied nationality they may
belong, but what the immortal deeds of
Greek and Roman warriors were to- the
youth of twenty years ago, so to those who
shall hear ,of them in their schools' for ages
to- come, shall be the epic stories of the
"Anzac" Army!
People will pay pilgrimages and listen
with bated, breath and inflamed patriotic
ardour to their recital, and will feel proud
that they are descendants of ancestors so
strong and glorious in war. All that is
now left to those who are spared to return
to loved ones and the land for which they
fought is to be deeply grateful for the high
privilege of having been able to play a part
in the great struggle, and to remember
that 1 high places carry high responsibilities:
that the honour won by themselves and by
their dead comrades is a sacred trust placed
in their hands. If the manhood and
womanhood of Australia is as great in peace
as it was in war, then the measure of her
coming greatness no man; can measure.

RED CROSS.
EDUCATIONAL REPORT.
A good percentage of the Australian
public having subscribed to the Red Cross,
a few details regarding supplies on board
the H.M.A.T. Kanowna, will not he amiss.
As each man. came on board at South-
ampton, he was handed 1 smokes;, chocolate,
and a wallet by a. Red Cross officer, and
on board there were over £4,000 worth of
comforts, to. be distributed during the
voyage, consisting chiefly of the following
articles: Tinned fruit, lime juice, cocoa, a;nd
milk, eating chocolate, tobacco, cigarette®,
and' kit bags containing an. assortment of
useful clothing, the value of which retail
would amount to over £2. 10s. per kit, was
given to every man after pulling out from
Southampton.
The other supplies are issued to the hos-
pital wards daily, and troop decksi once a
week. These benefits go a long way in
helping to make the "homeward 1 bound"
voyage pleasant.
EDUCATION.
Matters educational have gone on very
satisfactorily durittg the voyage. At first
the outlook was not altogether promising,
as no educational personnel were sent oil
board except an education, officer and a
sergeant, who was to combine the duties
of librarian and law lecturer. Willing
helpers from amongst the N.G;o:'s find ilieii
came forward, however; and they, in addi-
tion to carrying on their ordinary duties,
took up work as instructors.
The following classes have been formed,
and much good work has already been done,
this result being due both to the enthusi-
asm of the instructors; and to the keenness
of the students: French, advanced and ele-
mentary, Warrant Officer McAulay and
C'orpl. Sprinz; commercial law, Sergt, Ross;
bookkeeping, W.O. McAulay; motor engill.*
eering, Corpl. Sprinz; shorthand, Sergt.
Harris; photography, Sfergt. Downing;
mathematics, Education Officer.
A Farmers' Club has also been formed
under the leadership of SeTgt. McCurrie
and L.-Corpl. Jeffers, and three mornings a
week some dozen or more of Australia's
primary producers may be seen on, the boat
deck deep in discussions on topics of in-
terest to the farmer.
Up to date the subjects dealt with include
soil, origin and varieties; moisture and fer-
tility of soils; dry farming; maize growing;
sheep on farms; starting a farm on virgin
country; manuring; hints on starting a
dairy farm; and also general discussions
on the Repatriation Act and the settle-
ment of soldiers on the land in the vari-
oust States.
The total enrolments for all classes num-
ber over a hundred, and, the average at-
tendance is being well maintained.
There are a number of text-hooks oil
various subjects in the educational library.
Some are reference books, others are for
sale. To date over £ll worth of books
have been bought, and there is every like-
lihood that the sales will be greatly in-
creased before the end of the voyage, as
the books are being sold at cost price.
The fiction library has also been attached
to the Education Department, and all hands
seem to be taking full advantage of it.
Over two hundred volumes are in circula-
tion at a time.

SPORTS AND AMUSEMENTS.
(BY THE SPORTS OFFICER.)
In this connection, it will be admitted
we commenced our voyage at a disadvan-
tage as compared with ordinary transports,
the quota.® for which are organised and con-
centrated; in camp some days before em-
barkation. In: the ease of this ship l one did
not know until after embarkation what
talene for entertainment there was on
board, nor what was required in the shape
of music, sports gear, etc.
However, some very good, talent was soon
unearthed, and Up to date (24-9-1919) eight.


concerts have been, given. Pte. Evans
soon got a "brain wave," and a Pierrot,
Troupe was formed, which commenced pre-
parations at once. Two tailors, (Dvr.
Whyte, F Deck, and Pte. Burrows, F Deck)
were soon found', audi with the ever-ready
help, of our worthy Matron, and, Sisters,
who supplied all the accessories for the
costumes, and ironed, them also, it was
possible for the, troupe; to make its first
public appearance two days later. That they
met with unbounded success, no one will
deny. Far be it from me to add: anything
better than the reception accorded, them.
The members of tlie troupe are as follows:
Q.M.S. Bickfordi, 8 Sergt Pettigrove, S-Sergt.
MeKenzie, S-Sergt. Knott, Pte. Evans (pro-
ducer), and Pte. Cottle (accompanist). The
troupe is now busy practising new numbers
for the next Show, which everyone is
eagerly looking forward to. We all hope to
see and hear them more often after leaving
Durban.
In the matter of entertainments and
dances, one must not forget the great
assistance rendered by Pte. Cottle, the offi-
cial accompanist, without whose help the
voyage would have been a very "dumb
show."
Our first sports competition was held on
Friday, Sept. 12, and judging by the en-
thusiasm shown was a,n unqualified success.
The events and successful competitors were
as follow:
Potato Race: Pte Smith, F Deck, 1; Pte
Me Id rum, B Deck, 2.
Thread-the-needle Race: Pte Brown, B
Deck, 1; Pte Gannon, B Deck, 2.
Drill: Bdr Smith, F Deck.
Wheelbarrow Race: Sergt Stienwedel and
Pte Hughes, H Ward, 1; Ptes Butterworth
and O'Neill 1 , B' Deck, 2.
Bun-eating contest: Pte Brown, B Deck,
1; Pte Smith, F Deck, 2.
Obstacle Race: Pte Weston, H Ward, 1;
Pte Stiles, B Deck, 2; Pte Butterworth, B
Deck, 3.
The O'Grady Drill proved quite a feature,
Bdr. Smith gaining a well-merited; win. In
the fourth beat of the thread-the-needle
race, one could not help but admire the
same Bombardier's; initiative when he
dashed across; the field to a Sister whom,
we presume, he judged on her previous per-
formance to be the champion needle
threader. However, the other competitors
pfbjected to being "crossed" in this manner,
and the judges' decision to' "draw for
sisters" was the quickest way out of the
argument.
The most amusing item on the pro-
gramme was the bun-eating contest, and
our worthy skipper, Captain Smith, seemed
to share this opinion also. One will never
forget the convulsions of laughter into
which he went, and it was not until his
retirement to the music room that one
could concentrate one's mind on the bun-
eating. It was nothing more; than a coin-
cidence, so I'm told, that all the bun-
eaters paraded for No. 9's next morning.
Deck billiards and quoits tournaments
are now in progress, and a. boxing contest
has been "billed" for the first Wednesday
after leaving Durban.
In the matter of deck cricket, only two
matches have been played to a finish, and
both of these were "Officers v. Diggers."
In the first match the officers won by 29
runs, but in the second had to succumb
to a horrible defeat by 228 runs on the
first innings.
H Ward 1 commenced a match against E
Ward, but after losing two balls in about
five minutes, it was decided to discontinue
the match to allow the boatswain to get
a credit balance of balls, he not being able
to make them as quickly as the cricketers
could lose them —certainly a very intelli-
gent decision.
The Officers commenced another match
against the Diggers to-day. Chptain Wilton,
M.0., opened for the officers. One bail went
over the side early in the match. A new
ball was provided, and when, the "Doc."
had knocked up 180 runs, the second ball
decided to follow in the wake of its prede-
cessor, and so took: the final plunge, to
the accompaniment of loud sobs from the
bereaved players. The heavy expenditure
of balls in this way is indeed unfortunate,
but will not dampen the ardour of the
enthusiasts so long as the boatswain can
keep up the supply! In this match one
innings each has been played, the scores
being: Officers, 352 (Captain Wilton 200
retired); and Diggers, 348 (S.-Sergt. Clark
138 and Pte. Jeff era 88). The match will
be concluded on leaving Durban.
Five dances have been held, i.e., two, for
officers and three for "diggers," and it is
intended to hold them regularly.
The result, of the Chess Tournament was:
Sergt. Clements, A Ward, 1; Pte. Waters,,
runner-up; while; that of the Whist Drive
was as, follows: Ptes. Ghristensen and Don-
ovan, A Ward 1 , 1; Pte, Cannon and; Pte.
Fordham, F Deck, ru;nners-up.
The Bridge and Draughts Tournaments
are now in. progress.
The following sports gear has already
found a watery grave, of which we mourn
the loss: 3 medicine balls, 1 punch ball, 12
cricket balls (more or less!), 6 tennis balls.
In conclusion, we express our thanks to
the willing band of helpers who,, through
the assistance rendered by them at concerts,
dances, sports, etc., have done so much
towards making our long and tedious jour-
ney the more bearable. We look forward
to their continued support during the re-
mainder of our voyage, and hope others
will be forthcoming, ®o that we may make
the second and final stage even better than
the first.
Our thanks are also due to the ship's
officers and crew, who have done, SO' much
towards making possible all the entertain-
ments.
HUMOROUS PROSE.
NOT TOO BAD.
FIRST PRIZE, B CLASS.
First Chapter according to the Gospel.
1. And it came to pass that in those
days there was a great war.
2. And a great multitude arose and left
the land of the Southern Cross to wage
war with the Turk and the Huns.
3. Now amongst their nuanbers was one
called Billjim, the son; of Bill, of the land
of Waybaok.
4. Wherefore he was a stalwart warrior,
also a wise and a shrewd head.
5. Howbeit didst the wily gypo imshi at
his approach.
6. And he didst tarry with his comrades,
fighting in strange lands, and bringing
great stouch unto all who opposed him.
7. Now, behold! In the far land of Flan-
ders he didst fall unfortunate.
8. For he was smitten.
9. But they took him unto the Land of
Blighty.
10. And the people of the land arose, and
when they beheld Lis wants they didst give
freely of their substance.
11. Wherefore didst Billjim rejoice.
12. Now, it came to pas® that he was
boarded, and after a great journey he ar-
rived back in his own land.
13. And; when he saw the slackness of
the place, he didst go unto an incinerator
and smothered himself with sackcloth and
ashes.
14. For he was exceedingly sad, and said
unto himself: "What manner of men are
these that they know not they sport they
misseth?"
15. Now it came to pass he didst recover
from his hurts. Wherefore he was given
his ticket.
16. Also they rigged him out in fine
raiment.
17. And when his gaze fell upon the
raiment he marvelled.
18. And being a shrewd headi, he took it
unto one called Uncle, he of the three
brass balls.
19. Thereafter didst Billjim go unto the
recruiting office and didst become a disciple
of recruiting.
20. And straightway didst he go out and
address the multitude, and he said unto
them:
21. "O, ye that call yourselves Austra-
lians, what cometh unto, ye that ye hear
not the ery of your brethren afar off?"
22. Thereat didst several answer him, say-
ing: "Verily will we go unto them," and
23. Therefore was Billjim exceedingly
glad, and when, he didst review the day's
work and didst jingle the coins that Uncle
gave unto him, he spoke in a loud voice,
saying: "Not too bad!"

SERIOUS POETRY.
HOMEWARD BOUND.
FIRST PRIZE.
"Homeward Bound," oft have we dreamed
of,
Thought of, prayed for this great day;
When to war and all it stood for
Glad farewells we each could say.
"Homeward Bound," but many comrades
Homeland's: welcome ne'er can share;
Sleep they 'neath the soil of far lands,
Men whom Homeland ill could spare,.
"Homeward Bound,," their voyage ended,
Ne'er forgotten shall they be;
Age on, age shall tell the story
How they died to keep us free,.
"Homeward Bound" with true hearts wait-
ing
Us in outstretched arms to take;
They who bore the pain of waiting
Cheerfully for love's dear sake.
"Homeward Bound," speed on Kanowna,
Quickly we would reach our shore;
Golden, sunny, dear Australia,
From her we will sail no more.

CROSSING THE LINE.
SECOND PRIZE.
We crossed the line on; our voyage
Which to North and to South set a
bound,
And met,bought that each man on this
transport
Another line crossing had found.
It came when the clear call of Empire
Was heard with its promise, of strife,
And the answer from old ways meant part-
ing
From home life, from mother, from wife.
But the manhood, of great Australasia
Crossed that line without halt, without
fear,
Determined from course marked by duty
No peril should them to veer.
And now they are homeward returning,
War's dark storms all over and past,
To a prosperous Peace won so dearly,
But a peace which for ages shall last.

HUMOROUS POEMS.
PERCY AND THE HUN.
FIRST PRIZE.
You're homeward bound for Aussie,
And no matter where you run,
I'll guarantee you'll ne'er forget
Old Percy and the bun.
Why did no guardian Digger
Down to his rescue swoop,
And say to him, "Dear Percy,
Desist —you're in the soup."
Now Percy in a contest once
He tried! to- eat a bun,
He tried to eat it all at once,
Which caused the- Diggers fun;
With open mouth and hands behind
He tried and tried and tried,
Just then a Digger hove in, sight,
And this is what he cried :
"Put a bit of treacle on it, Percy,
Put a, bit of treacle on it, do;
Put a bit of treacle on it, Percy,
Let me Leg of you.
The Diggers won't stop crying,
Oh, Percy, till you do;
Dab it on nice in the same place twice,
o'h, put a bit of treacle on it,, do."
Now Percy being a sporting chap,
He did as he was bid,
A fellow got the treacle
And made the bun non-skid.
He poured; it on in dibs and dabs
Till the bun was covered thick,
And the Diggers kept on singing out
Till Percy looked dead sick:
"Put a bit of treacle on it, Percy," etc.

THE "KANOWNA" COCKiES CLUB.
SECOND PRIZE.
If you find the long voyage dreary, and
are feeling dipped and weary,
Just hop up to the Boat Deck, where the
Cookies, hold their class;
There you'll gain much information how to
run a, farm, or station,
And they'll argue any subject from har-
vesters to- grass.
If you've got a hungry yearning for a living
to be earning,
From a fertile patch, of good Australian
soil,
You will find them optimistic, and in lan-
guage most artistic
Will promise you a fortune, with a mini-
mum of toil.
You will hear them curse the rabbits and
their devastating habits,
And how it's best, to battle with the curse,
Hear them, spout of fertilisers and of wily
advertisers,
Who are, out to make- a, fortune out of
poor old cooky's purse.
Listen to their views on marriage and the
ruinous cost of carriage,
How to build a barn or haystack, and
how to hang a gate;
How by courage and hard, working, and not
by shiftless shirking,
You can conquer nature's curses, and be
master of your fate.
Tpr. E. R. GILMAN.
THE ANCIENT WARRIOR.
1.
Have I been a soldier long, sir?
Well, a thousand years or more,
For I served a year as a charioteer
In "8.C." one-nought-four.
%
My liife has, been one long battle, sir,
Ever since I was a boy;
I was number one on a Lewis gun
In the wooden horse of Troy.


3.
The things I have seen and suffered, sir,
Would fill many a massive tome;
1 was in the storm of Carthage,
And helped in the sack of Rome.
A.
I bombed with Harold at Hastings,
And can never forget the day
When Wellington lost his gas-hat
In the stunt at Botany Bay.
I. am the first original Anzac
Who charged at Sari-Bair,
And fought like a lion in the "Wazza"
Until wounded by a flare.
6.
But one thing I'll always remember,
Till I can remember no more,
Was the day I sailed on the Kanowna
To find Australia's shore.
7.
Yes, I've seen a bit of sloush, sir,
In the wild and woolly past,
But I can't abide ship's tucker,
So I'm afraid I'm done at last.
Bi.
But wherever soldiers gather
In the far off distant years,
They will drink to the "King of Liars"
In long Australian beers.

TO DIGGERS RETURNING
HOME, ADVICE.
Don't tell your friends graphic tales of
battles you were never in. Some of them
may have been there or know more than
you do about them, and may say some-
thing which would injure your finer feel-
ings.
If you bear in mind, the fact that there
were 350,000 other Australians at- the war.
it will make you cautious apd prevent you
from rambling.
The average Digger is seldom guilty of
telling lies, but lie often stretches the truth
beyond recognition. It is nice to clothe
bare facts with pretty language, btu if you
say too much it becomes fiction.
If you say too much about the leaves' you
have had whilst on service, your friends
may wonder if you got as far as the war.
If anybody 1 asks to see your medals and
you haven't any, don't hesitate in telling
them of the decorations you would have
had if only a general and a few dozen staff
officer's had witnessed your reckless brav-
ery. (Others have tokl this tale with suc-
cess.)
When telling your Australian girl of
friends you met in England, don't say too
much about "Dints" or "Tabbies," for most
of them, have heard these words before a.nd
know what they mean.
Co through your collection of photo-
graphs before you arrive home, especially
if you were married before you left. There
may be a few pictures which will make your
wife curious, and it's so boring trying to
explain things.
If you are asked for your opinion about
the way tlie stunts were conducted, don t
be too hard on Haig and Foch. They did
their best. Your friends will understand
that you could have done better had you
been in their place.
When talking of your Paris leaves, don't
refer to more than the public buildings
and beauty spots.
When you talk of theatres and places of
amusement you saw in the U.K. and else-
where, remember what it cost you and ke.ep
quiet, for your friends may think you
foolish.
Don't hesitate in telling your girl friends
of the number of times you were crimed;
they are strangely fascinated by tales of
reckless adventure, and will think the more
of you as long as you don't tell them how
badly you took your punishment at the
time.
Always talk bravely of your reminis-
cences in France. It was always the cool
evening air which used to make you shiver
and feel miserable when the Gothas were
overhead.
When your friends accuse you of neglect
ini writing, remember the submarine war-
fare gag still holds good and can't be con-
tradicted.

THE CLEAN LITTLE COON OF CAPE
VERDE.
1.
Up like Neptune from the sea he came,
Unwashed, unkempt, no clothes —no shame!
At the door of the ward he made his bow,
With a dusky friend to make pow-wow.
2.
Stock-still they stood in their native way.
To ask for shield from the sun's fierce ray,
Though, fearful to "donner" Red Cross
clothes,
We granted his wish because of his pose.
3,
We took him in and we washed him clean,
Till his thick skin shone with a dusky
sheen,
And his rotund "tummy" expanded the
more
In pride at a comfort felt never before.
4.
We dressed, him in white —cap, trousers,
and shirt,
Ten. sizes too big,, but tightly girt,
Then sent him oil' with a blessing and push
To join his friends of the tropical bush.
5.
We saw him later, at the close of day,
Sitting on haunch, in his usual way,
'Midst the coal of the barge, sailing home-
ward with joy,
As proud as a lord, a picture for "Poi."

"KANOWNA'S" WAR RECORD!.
The A.U.S.N. Gov's H.M.A.T. "Kanowna'
was the first Australian vessel to be em-
ployed as a troopship. On the outbreak
of war the "Kanowna" was lying at Towns-
ville —a port on the Melbourne to Cairns
service, on which she was then trading—
and a vessel being required to transport
troops from tvoith Queensland to Thursday
Island and German New Guinea, she was
commandeered by the Government for that
purpose on stli August, 1914. On com-
pleting that work she returned for a short
time to the coastal trade.
On the Ist June, 1915, she was taken
over by the Commonwealth Government,
and left Sydney as a troopship, under com-
mand of Captain Wm. Smith, on 19th June,
1915, proceeding to Egypt, and England.
On arrival in England, the "Kanowna"
was fitted as a hospital ship, leaving Lon-
don with Australian invalids in September,
1915, since when she has been engaged in
repatriating Australian invalids from Eng-
land and Egypt, and Imperial invalids from
Mediterranean and African ports. She al o
made a voyage to Foujes, Turkey, shortly
before the armistice with Germany, evacu-
ating a large number of British invalid
prisoners of war.
