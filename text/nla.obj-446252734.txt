The Basic Wage
Betrayal.
PRICE 3d.
THE PROMISE.
The Right Honorable W. M. Hughes,
P.C., M.P., Prime Minister of Australia,
at Bendigo, October 30th, 1919, stated:
“If we are to have industrial peace, we
must be prepared to pay the price, and that
price is justice to the worker. Nothing less
will serve.”
“The Government is, therefore, appoint-
ing a Royal Commission to inquire into the
cost of living in relation to the minimum or
basic wage. The Commission will be fully
clothed with power, to ascertain what is a
fair basic wage, and how much the purchas-
ing power of the sovereign has been depre-
ciated during the war; also how the basic
wage may be adjusted to the present pur-
chasing power of the sovereign, and the
best means, when once so adjusted, of auto-
matically adjusting itself to the rise and fall
of the sovereign. The Government will, at
the earliest date possible, create effective
machinery to give effect to these principles.”
THE BETRAYAL.
The Prime Minister (Hansard No. 56,
•page 6819) inter alia:
“One thing I do reject absolutely and
without reservation. I reject, because of its
impossibility, any proposal to pay £5/16/-.”

CONGRESS OF INTERSTATE LABOR
COUNCILS AND FEDERATED UNIONS
RE BASIC WAGE COMMISSION.
Reply to Memorandum of Mr. A. B. Piddington,
K.C., Chairman of Basic Wage Commission.
As Adopted by Congress.
The Memorandum referred to was submitted
by Mr. Piddington on the evening of November
22nd, 1920, to Hon. W. M. Hughes, Prime Minis-
ter, in response to a request made by him at 5
p.m. on that day, for a Memorandum on the fol-
lowing matters: —
1. The true incidence of the cost of living.
2. How the findings of the Commission as to
Scost of living may be distributed between
(1) man and wife, (2) each of three de-
pendent children.
3. How the said finding of the Commission
can be made effective so as to secure for
every employee the actual cost of living
according to its true incidence, accepting
the finding of £5/16/- as the actual cost
of living for a man, wife and three chil-
dren.
4. The effect upon industry, domestic, and for
foreign countries, of making a basic wage
for all employes of £5/16/-.
5. The effect of that course upon prices and
actual realization of the desired stan-
dard of comfort.
6. The effect upon the Commonwealth’s obli-
gations to its employees, permanent and
temporary, of whatever course is adopted.
The memorandum was written by Mr. Pidding-
ton in his capacity as a-civil servant, and not as
a Chairman of the Commission, as the following
extract from the Report shows: —


“The subject of this memorandum is out-
side the terms of the Letters Patent of this
Commission, and I have at no time discussed
it with aqy of my colleagues. Having received
your request at 5 p.m. to-day, there has been
no opportunity to summon my colleagues to
ascertain whether they desire to take part in
this matter, therefore I do not sign this
memorandum as Chairman.”
Yours sincerely,
(Sgd.) A. B. PIDDINGTON.
GENERAL.
Mr. Piddington’s Memorandum in reference to
the application of the finding of the Basic Wage
Commission, though written hurriedly and ob-
viously without the reflection and investigation
that such an important and far-reaching subject
deserved, has been accepted by the Government,
and by a section of the public, as an authoritative
statement, proving inability of the community
to pay a wage of £5/16/-, and has had con-
siderable effect in confusing the public mind on
the issues arising out of the Commission’s report.
Consequently, the opportunity is here taken of
refuting many of the statements contained in the
Memorandum, and of expressing the attitude of
the Trade Union Movement on the question.
Every aspect of the matter has been carefully
reviewed by this Conference, and all the available
statistics that appeared helpful have been exam-
ined; but no evidence can be found to substan-
tiate the statement that industry would be ruined
by the payment of a basic wage of £5/16/- to
all adult male employes.
Published statistics are so incomplete and in-
definite that it is impossible to prove from them
by mathematical computation, as has been
attempted by Mr. Piddington, the effect upon in-
dustry of a basic wage of £5/16/-, so we have


ber; forced to rely on a general survey of the
economic field and its resources to guide us in
our conclusions.
It is significant that throughout the memoran-
dum it is assumed that the present division of
the product of industry between capital and
labor is equitable, and that the relative amount
due to each class is an invariable quantity, con-
sequently any adjustment of the proved disability
of the workers must be made without encroach-
ing on profits.
We do not accept this position. In recent
years;, according to latest available data,
labor’s share of production has been steadily
diminishing, and we now demand, at least,
the immediate restoration of the portion
of which we have been deprived, together with
such automatic adjustment as will enable the
workers to maintain and improve their relative
positions.
£5/16/6 (Melbourne) has been described as
an unattainable basic wage, but a moment’s con-
sideration of its purchasing power will readily
dispel this idea. No one has yet asserted that the
wage fixed is too high to provide a reasonable
standard of comfort, or pointed to a single ex-
travagant article in the Commission’s Indicator
Lists, which establish the commodity value of
the wage, so it is unnecessary to deal with this
phase of 'the question, except to say that no ad-
equate provision is made for saving, unemploy-
ment, sickness, and many other essential items.
Reference to Mr. Knibbs’ Bulletin, No. 81,
shows that goods purchasable in Melbourne for
38/8 in 1920, cost 17/6 in 1907. Thus it will be
seen that the “fabulous” wage of £5/16/6 cor-
responds to a wage of £2/12/8 in 1907 10/8
above the basic wage awarded by Mr. Justice
Higgins in the Harvester case—and yet we are
told that industry would be ruined if such a


wage were paid. In this connection it would be
interesting to have a list of the industries im-
perilled, also the nominal total of non-existent
capital upon which interest is being paid.
Since 1914, we have incurred a war debt of
nearly £350,000,000, and public expenditure has
increased tremendously in other directions, and
all these obligations have been met without diffi-
culty. No protest was made by the Government
when the “patriotic” capitalist demanded in-
creased interest on loan money, and exhorbi-
tant profits on goods and commodities required
for war purposes; but now, when its own Com-
mission, representative of employers and em-
ployes, presents a unanimous finding for a basic
wage of £5/16/6, and a report which proves
conclusively that the workers of Australia are
living under scandalous conditions, we find the
leaders of the Government repudiating its solemn
pledge, notwithstanding the Prime Minister’s
statement at Bendigo:
“If we are to have industrial peace we must
be prepared to pay the price, and that price is
justice to the workers. Nothing less will
serve.”
The cry of inability to pay is but another
bogey, and if capitalist control and management
of industry cannot, or will not, provide for every
unit in the community a decent standard of living,
then the workers will be forced to realise that
their only hope lies in the re-organisation of in-
dustry on a social basis, which will utilise the
services of all and insure to every individual the
right to the means of the best life according
to his needs.
CATEGORICAL REPLIES TO MR. PIDDINC-
TON’S MEMORANDUM.
I.—The True Incidence of the Cost of Living.
Under this heading, Mr. Piddington says:
“Assuming that the basic wage does provide the


actual cost of living of the typical family” (man,
wife, and three dependent children).
1. All families with more than three dependent
children suffer privation.
2. All families with less than three dependent
children receive more than is necessary for
the living wage.
3. All unmarried men receive what would sup-
port a wife and three children.
4. Mr. Piddington includes in his list of depen-
dents only wives and children under 14
years.
He has omitted the following who are wholly
or partly dependent on wage-earning class:—
(a) All old age pensioners.
(b) All invalid pensioners.
(c) Thousands of boys and girls over 14 years
of age who are working for less than a
living wage. (See almost any Wages
Board or Arbitration Court Award).
(d) Thousands of fathers and mothers and
other relatives deprived through various
circumstances of a livelihood, and not in
receipt of State assistance, but who are
maintained by their sons and daughters.
(e) All school children over 14 years.
(f) Girls over 14 years who are not permitted
by regulations to enter industries. (The
minimum age is 15 years in Victoria.)
(g) All workers temporarily unable, through
sickness and unemployment, to earn
wages.
These seven classes are usually maintained
by classes designated (2) and (3) by Mr. Pid-
dington, and his statement as to the incidence
of the cost of living is shown to be incomplete.
Mr. Piddington quotes the following population
figures which he says are relevant, and upon
them he bases his estimate of the number of
workers to whom the basic wage will apply.


Children under 14.

Conjugal Conditions.

bands and chil-
dren
220,400
645,626 —
974,966
879,418 .90
These figures relating to the total number af-
fected by the finding and as to the number of
children appear to be inaccurate, A careful an-
alysis of 1911 census figures fails to reveal the
source from which they were obtained. The
Census Report contains no table combining occu-
pation, conjugal condition and issue. Under
heading “Occupations—Males in receipt of sal-
ary and wages—ages 20-64,” are shown as
804,574. This number comprises all in receipt
of salary, and must, therefore, include a great
number outside the scope of the commission,
such as politicians, judges, officials, and
managers of commerce and industry, etc.
The figures quoted by Mr. Piddington are es-
timates used in a manner which implies that they
are statistics. They have an important bearing
on the question, and require explanation.
2.—How the Findings of the Commission as to
i the Cost of Living May be Distributed
Between (1) Man and Wife, (2) Each of
Three Dependent Children.


Mr. Piddington replies thus: —
(a) Man and Wife £4 0 0
(b) Three Dependent Children 116 0
£516 0
The three dependent children referred to are
aged 10 y 2, % and 3 V2 years.
3.—How the Said Finding of the Commission can
be Made Effective so as to Secure to
Every Employe the Actual Cost of Living
According to its True Incidence, Accept-
ing the Finding of £5/16/- as the Actual
Cost of Living for a Man, Wife, and Three
Children.
Here Mr. Piddington proposes, among other
things, that bachelors and childless married men
shall receive only £4 per week, while married
men with children shall receive £ 4 per week and
12/- per week for each dependent child under 14,
no matter what the number may be.
Taking sections (2) and (3) together, and
having shown under section (1) that the cost of
living touches married men without dependent
children under 14, and bachelors more or less
heavily, at no less than seven points not observed
by Mr. Piddington, we emphatically condemn his
suggestion to penalise childless workers. This
proposal, if adopted, would take the last surplus
penny from a large section of the working class,
and as periods of unemployment recur often to
almost everyone, the workers would be reduced
to a point below the subsistence level.
The Commission and the parties represented
assumed the immediate application of the finding
to all workers. In determining the cost of main-
tenance of the typical family, this was taken into
account, and several claims of the Union dis-
allowed on the ground that subsequent to mar-
riage the man would receive wages covering the


maintenance of three children at periods when
they were non-existent. (See Commission's Re-
port, page 45.) Most of the Unions’ claims under
the heading “Miscellaneous Items” were dis-
allowed on this ground. The wage of £5/16/-
makes no provision for saving, insurance, un-
employment, sickness, or maternity expenses. It
will thus be seen that the suggestion to pay £4
for a man and wife, if adopted, would not insure
the standard of comfort approved by the Com-
mission.
4.—The Effect upon Industry, Domestic, and for
Foreign Countries of Making a Basic Wage
for all Employes of £5/16/-.
Summarised, Mr. Piddington’s Memorandum
says that to raise the wages of all workers to
£5/16/- would mean an increase of £93,000,-
000, and the Prime Minister, in effect, says that
the industry could not pay it.
In this section, the Memorandum states that
the total value of production of the Common-
wealth in 1918 was £298,000,000, and that the
increased burden upon industry would amount to
31 per cent, of the production in 1918.
The statement has been widely quoted and is
the basis of the Government’s refusal to honor
its pledge, by enforcing the payment of the basic
wage of £5/16/-.
This sum (298 millions) has been represented
as the only source from which wages are drawn,
and it is stated that the full amount of the in-
crease must be charged against this fund.
How far this statement is from being correct
cannot be ascertained, because data are not
available; but that it is astonishingly defective
the following shows: —
According to Mr. Knibbs’ Bulletin No. 13, the
£298,000,000 is made up as follows:


Value of Production, 1918.
Industry. Yield.
Agriculture £56,080,000
Pastoral 98,297,000
Dairying, Poultry, Bees, etc. .. 33,738,000
Forestry and Fisheries 7,137,000
Mining 26,156,000
Manufacturing (value added in
process of manufacture) .. 75,261,000
£298,669,000
The £298,000,000 represents the value, at
wholesale rates, of the six principal items of pro-
duction only. The wage of £5/16/- is based on
retail prices. The ability of the community to
pay should therefore be estimated at the point
of consumption, and not at the point of produc-
tion, as taken by Mr. Piddington.
It is most important to note that the value of
production for 1918 was lowest since 1914; fur-
ther, since then, 200,000 men have returned from
the front and re-entered industries. Wholesale
prices increased by 37 per cent, between 1918 and
June 30th, 1920. The value of the £298,000,000
consequently would have been £409,000,000 at
June 30th, 1920.
The appended list, whilst indefinite and in-
complete, represents more correctly than that
used by Mr. Piddington the services and com-
modities whose value constitutes the pool of
national distributable wealth, from which the
present wage is paid, and against which the in-
crease should be charged. A reduction in profits
may result; but there is ample evidence of a suffi-
cient margin to suffer this without hampering
industry in the disastrous manner predicted by
Mr. Piddington.
s.—List of Goods and Services to be taken into
Account in Estimating the National Dis-
tributable Income.


1. Production (1918). £298,000,000; In-
crease in price (30/6/20) —37 per cent—
£111,000,000; total £409,000,000.
2. —Wholesale and Retail Profits on (a)
3. —Wholesale and Retail Profits on Imported
Goods. (Imports valued £100,000,000).
4. —Armed Forces. —Naval, Military, Police, &c.
5. —Government Services. Commonwealth,
State, and Municipal,
€.— Professional Services. —lncluding Doctors,
Nurses, Lawyers, Teachers, Lecturers,
Singers, Musicians, Actors, etc.
7. —Domestic Services.— Embracing all persons
engaged in the supply of board and lodging,
and in rendering personal services for
which remuneration is usually paid.
8. —Commercial Services. —Of persons not en-
gaged in the production and distribution
embraced in above list.
9. —Transport.—Embracing all services for
transport of goods and persons, such as
Shipping, Railways, Tramways, Passenger
Conveyances, Cartage and Carrying Ser-
vices.
10. —Building and Construction.—Value of ser-
vices engaged in construction of Buildings,
Railroads and their equipment. Roads,
Bridges, etc.
11. — Rent. —Of Buildings not used for commer-
cial and productive purposes.
12. —Services connected with Banking, Insurance,
Friendly Societies, etc.
13. —Output of Baking Establishments.
14. —Output of Factories employing less than 4
hands.
It is impossible' to estimate the total amount
of the national income from published figures,
but this list serves to show how inconclusively
the question has been dealt with by Mr. Pidding-
ton and the Government.


The amount of £ 241,000,000, total net income
for individuals for year ending June 30th, 1915,
which has been quoted, from War Census, by the
Prime Minister, is likewise unreliable as an estim-
ate for the purposes under consideration. The
year 1914-1915 (which marked the inauguration
of the war and resulted in the most serious dis-
location of industry) covered a drought period,
and in that year unemployment reached the
highest point recorded since 1891. (Bulletin No.
81, p. 62.) These two factors reduced the incomes
of all classes much below the average of normal
years. Further, when we take account of the
understatements through fear of wealth con-
scription or a wealth levy which undoubtedly
occurred, and the normal conditions prevailing,
such as the withdrawal of men from industry for
war purposes, it must be seen that it is as futile
to refer to £241,000,000 (income) as to £298.-
000,000 (production) for the purpose of proving
the case.
6. —The Effect of Paying a Wage of £5/16/- per
Week to All Employes upon Prices and
upon the Actual Realisation of the Stan-
dard of Comfort.
Here Mr. Piddington voices the popular fallacy
that the price of commodities is determined by
wages. He assumes the increase of the present
wage—£4 to £5/16/- —and states that for the
purpose of argument he eliminates all other fac-
tors which influence prices, such as drop in world
prices, etc., and shows the effect of an increase
in wages as follows: —
“With quarterly automatic adjustments of
wages to prices, assuming labor-cost to be
50 per cent., production value or price, then,
if a present wage of £4 were increased to
£5/16/-, the following table shows what
would be the course of events:—

The absurdity of reasoning on these lines can
best be shown by isolating another factor in the
determination of prices, namely, a general
drop in world prices, and applying this in the
same manner, but showing the reverse effect. The
Commission has recommended an automatic ad-
justment of wages in accordance with the in-
crease or decrease in prices. Assuming 10 per
cent, drop in prices, wages would decrease as
follows: —
and so on.
During the past century, wages have invariably
followed prices, both on the upward and down-
ward trend, demonstrating that prices reflect
themselves in wages, and not the reverse, as has
been stated in the Memorandum.
The following figures from Bulletin 81, p.p. 68
and 73, further disprove contentions put forward.
In Queensland, where the highest wage was paid,
the cost of living was lowest, and in Tasmania
with the second lowest wage, we find the cost of
living second highest.

CONCLUSIONS.
(1) That the Memorandum furnishes no valid
reason why the finding of the Commission
should not be given effect to immediately.
<2) That the statement of the true incidence of
the cost of living is inaccurate and in-
complete.
<3) That the Memorandum contains no evidence
of ascertained facts which prove the effect
upon industry of the payment of a wage
of £5/16/-.
Facts about the Commission.
APPOINTMENT AND POWERS OF THE BASIC
WAGE COMMISSION.
The Federal Royal Commission on the Basic
Wage was appointed by Letters Patent dated the
6th December, 1919.
The Commission was to enquire into and
report on the following matters;—
1. The actual cost of living at the present time,
according to reasonable standards of com-
fort, including all matters comprised in the
ordinary expenditure of a household, for a
man with a wife and three children under
fourteen years of age, and the several items
and amounts which make up that cost.


2. The actual corresponding cost of living dur-
ing each of the last five years.
3. How the basic wage may be automatically
adjusted to the rise and fall from time to
time of the purchasing power of the sover-
eign.
The Commission consisted of the Chairman,
Mr. A. B. Piddington, K.C.; the representatives
of the employers, Messrs. G. M. Allard, J. A. Har-
per and E. E. Keep; and the representatives of
the employees, Messrs. R. Cheney, H. C. Gibson,
and T. C. Maher.
During the course of the Commission’s work,
Messrs. G. M. Allard and J. A. Harper tendered
their resignations as Commissioners, and Messrs.
A. C. Morley and W. D. Gilflllan were appointed in
their stead.
THE ORIGIN OF THE COMMISSION.
The need of the appointment of some compe-
tent body to enquire into the Basic Wage was
stressed on many occasions by both Mr. Justice
Higgins and Mr. Justice Powers, President and
Deputy President, respectively, of the Common-
wealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration.
Early in 1919 a Conference of Federated
Unions was convened by the Victorian Branch of
the Australian Tramway Association, to consider
amendments to the Commonwealth Conciliation
and Arbitration Act, and other matters affecting
Unions appearing before the Commonwealth
Conciliation and Arbitration Court.
This Conference decided to deputationise the
Prime Minister, the Right Honorable W. M.
Hughes, P.C., M.P., with the request that a Royal
Commission be appointed to determine what
should be the Wage. After hearing a depu-
tation from the Conference, the Prime Minister
replied that a Royal Commission would be ap-
pointed.


That it was an item of Government policy was
first announced by the Prime Minister in deliver-
ing his Policy Speech at Bendigo, on October
30th, 1919. The announcement was thus re-
ported:—
“If we are to have industrial peace we must be
prepared to pay the price, and that price is justice to
the worker. Nothing less will serve. We have long
ago adopted in Australia the principles of compulsory
arbitration for the settlement of industrial disputes
and of the minimum wage. The cause of much of the
industrial unrest, which is like fuel to the fires of
Bolshevism and direct action, arises with the real
wage of the worker—that is to say, the things he can
buy with the money he receives. This real wage de-
creases with an increase in the cost of living. Now,
once it is admitted that it is in the interests of the
community that such a wage should be paid as will
enable a man to marry and bring up children in decent,
wholesome conditions—and that point has been
settled long ago—it seems obvious that we must devise
better machinery for insuring the payment of such a
wage than at present exists. Means must be found
which will insure that the minimum wage shall be
adjusted automatically, or almost automatically, with
the cost of living, so that within the limits of the
minimum wage at least the sovereign shall always
purchase the same amount of the necessaries of life.
The Government is, therefore, appointing a Royal
Commission to inquire into the cost of living in rela-
tion to the minimum or basic wage. The Commission
will be fully clothed with power to ascertain what is
a fair basic wage, and how much the purchasing power
of the sovereign has been depreciated during the war;
also how the basic wage may be adjusted
to the present purchasing power of the sover-
eign, and the best means when once so
adjusted of automatically adjusting itself to the rise
and. fall of the sovereign. The Government will at the
earliest date possible create effective machinery to give
effect to these principles. Labor is entitled to a fair
share of the wealth it produces. The fundamental
question of the basic wage having been thus satis-
factorily—because permanently—settled, there remain
other causes of industrial unrest which must be dealt
with if we are to have industrial peace.”—“Age,” 31st
October, 1919).

2. The several items and amounts which make
up that cost are as follow: —


In answer to Clause 2 of the Letters Patent—
1. The actual corresponding cost of living in
1914 was; —
Melbourne £3 7 9
Sydney 312 6
Brisbane 3 411
Adelaide 311 4
Perth 3 13 11
Hobart 361
2. Findings as to the last four years (1915-
1919) are deferred pending Your Excellency’s
directions.
In answer to Clause 3 of the Letters Patent, the
Basic Wage may be automatically adjusted to
the rise and fall from time to time of the purchas-
ing power of the sovereign as follows: —
1. It should be the duty of a Bureau of Labour
Statistics, staffed from existing members of
the Commonwealth Public Service, to esti-
mate, etc., from quarter to quarter the actual
cost of the several services and itqms set
forth in the Report as to Rent, Food, Cloth-
ing and Miscellaneous.
2. This Bureau should declare that actual cost
upon an average of prices of the preceding
four quarters of the year.
8. This declaration should be reported to the
Commonwealth Arbitration Court with a view
to its being made the Basic Wage by the
Court in such manner as Parliament may
prescribe.
NATIONAL INSURANCE AGAINST DEATH
AND UNEMPLOYMENT.
In addition, the Commission recommended in-
itiation of National Insurance to cover unem-
ployment and to make provision to the worker’s *
family against the death of the breadwinner.


THE BETRAYAL.
The Prime Minister’s promise to give effect to
the findings of the Royal Commission on the
Basic Wage have not been honored. Rather they
have been repudiated in a most unblushing and
contemptuous manner.
*
Hansard No. 56, 1920, page 6819, reports the
Prime Minister saying, inter alia:—
“One thing I do reject absolutely, and with-
out reservation. I reject, because of its impos-
sibility, any proposal to pay £5/16/-. I reject
it because it will bring ruin to this country
ruin to the very men it is intended to benefit.’’
The committee of the Conference of Federated
Unions therefore publishes the reply of the Inter-
state Congress of Trades Unions, held at Mel-
bourne on January 29th and 31st, 1921, to the
memorandum of Mr. A. B. Piddington, upon
which the Prime Minister bases his contention
that the country cannot pay the Commission’s
findings.
