HOWARD AUTO-CULTIVATORS LIMITED
NORTHMEAD


THE HOWARD ROTARY HOE “FORDSON” is manufactured
in widths of 4ft.—4ft.‘ 6in.—sft., and in four different models,
ORCHARD. FIELD, VINEYARD, and SUGAR CANE.
The cultivator can be easily attached to the older model tractors,
but with the new type British Fordson, it is necessary to make an alteration
to the fenders of the tractor in order to fit the hoe cultivator correctly.
It will be necessary to fit the clutch pedal supplied by us instead of
the pedal on these new type tractors, and the adjustment to be made
by means of a small screw and lock nut.
INSTRUCTIONS FOR FITTING CULTIVATOR TO TRACTOR.
Place the cultivator on level ground. Put a piece of timber or a
bar about six (6) feet long over the rotar tube and under the centre
tubular member (or stay tube) of the cultivator, letting the front end
of the bar rest on the ground. Lift the front of the cultivator till the
axle seats are in line with the tractor axle and push the timber forward
to hold the cultivator in this position, the hoe blades in the meantime
resting on the ground. Remove the U-bolts and take out the pedestal
bolt. Remove the power take-off cover plate and put the cultivator drive
assembly in place using a gasket on the face to ensure an oil-tight
joint. Tighten the flange screws and turn the engine over by hand for
safety to see if any moving part is binding; start the engine and if the
gears do not run smoothly and are developing a grinding noise, remove
the assembly and flt additional paper gaskets to give the proper
meshing. The thickness of gaskets to be used vary from thin paper
to heavy brown paper, approx. .olsin. If unable to remedy the noise,
inform your Agent. Do not run the drive at all.
When drive assembly is correct, back the tractor carefully into
position, steering the lugs on the axle seats on the cultivator, allowing
the drive tubular member to slide under the tractor axle. Connect the
cultivator up in position by tightening on the U-bolts on the axle seats
and raise the drive shaft and housing, lining them up with the drive from
the tractor. Slide back the drive shaft cast-iron sleeve which houses
the clutch fork and expose the sliding dog. Raise this in position to
align the two shafts. When in the correct position tighten the axle
U-bolts. It will be essential to test out the travel of the sliding dog in
the clutch. Move the clutch handle backward and check the distance
away from the fixed dog at this position; move it forward and the spring
‘should have a little tension on it when the are in mesh. Tighten
t'he bolt on the pedestal stay, the stay being placed on top of the
pedestal. f


Slide the drive shaft sleeve back on the studs in the gear box
cover, tightening up in place securely and tighten the clamp bolt under
the sleeve. Raise the cultivator rotar off the ground by means of the
depth control wheel and start the engine. Let the power turn the
power take-off with the cultivator out of mesh, and make sure of
proper fitting. Next let the clutch into gear .and revolve the hoe
cultivator blades.
INSTRUCTIONS FOR WORKING
Before starting the tractor, put the cultivator control gear lever
in neutral by pushing back. Raise the cultivator from the ground by
screwing the depth control handle down so that the wheel resting on
the ground raises the blades from the ground. The machine is now
ready for travelling to work.
TO START WORK.—Screw the depth control wheel up so that it
allows the blades to enter the ground to the required working depth.
The depth .limit skid should be adjusted to clear the ground by one
inch when the cultivator is working full depth in the ground and its
purpose is to prevent the machine digging too deep when the offside
tractor wheel or depth control wheel drops into depressions in the
ground. It should not touch the ground in normal work.
With the engine running, put your tractor clutch well out, put
the cultivator control gear lever in gear by pulling the lever into the
forward notch, and let the clutch in slowly. For travelling short
distances without ploughing, leave the cultivator clutch in neutral
position; the cultivator can then roll on its blades.
When the ground requires to be worked finely, it is necessary to
run the cultivator in low gear, but where coarser work is required,
second gear may do the work desired.
If the ground is too heavy and the load too much for the tractor,
remove a row of hoes from the right-hand end of the cultivator rotar
till the tractor handles the load comfortably.
For ploughing virgin country or land tightly bound with ground
roots, the best results are obtained by working the blades just under
the surface, leaving for a few days and then working to the required
depth. When working in sugar cane country and ratooning is required,
it will be necessary to remove the centre flange of the sugar cane rotar
which is made adjustable by removing the hoe blades and segment
flange. The desired gap can then be made to allow the rows of small
cane to pass through.
MAINTENANCE OF BLADES
Examine the hoe blades daily. If any are bent out of line so that
the back of the blade is rubbing hard on the soil, straighten them
with the hooked bar provided, and carried in the centre tubular member
->f the cultivator.
if the blades are found to be too much worn to be handled that
way, they should be heated in a forge and beaten into shape. DO NOT
QUENCH IN WATER, simply leave out in the air; they are air-hardenirig
material.


It is essential that the cutting edge only should touch the soil
and the back have a clearance. If the edge of the blade should wear
thin, and tend to turn inwards, leaving a heavy shoulder rubbing on the
ground, this can be rectified by placing the end of the blade setting bar
behind the blade and tapping the edge back into position with a
hammer. The efficiency of the machine depends largely on the condition
of the hoes. If the hoes become bent through striking solid obstacles
m the ground and are not straightened, they will take more power to
drive, the quality of the work will be poor, and the hoes will wear
quickly.
A keen look-out therefore should be kept for bent hoes, which
should be straightened as soon as they are noticed.
MAINTENANCE, ADJUSTMENT AND
LUBRICATION
BOLTS, ETC. —It is very necessary to keep all bolts, nuts and
screws tight and these should be inspected occasionally.
SAFETY CLUTCH.—To prevent the possibility of the machine
being damaged by the hoe blades striking a solid obstacle on the ground
a safety clutch is provided on the driven end of the rotar. The springs
which keep the clutch in place are to be adjusted tight enough to allow
the rotar to be driven through the hardest ground required, but not
screwed up too tight. If the clutch is left too loose, the blades will
miss ground and there will be much unnecessary wear of parts. The
safety clutch will probably work stiffly at first, but must be readjusted
as soon as it begins to work. A loud clacking noise will denote when
the clutch is working. It will not be advisable to run the clutch too
long in this way, as the dogs will wear considerably.
DRIVE CHAIN.—The chain box cover should be taken off
regularly and the chain box thoroughly cleaned with flushing oil or
kerosene, at the same time tightening the chain tension. Replenish
with good quality transmission oil, approx. I quart. Also keep the
gear boxes supplied with this lubricant; 2in. depth is quite sufficient.
The drive shaft housing sliding sleeve is provided for a small quantity
of lubrication to be fed to the clutch sliding dog. The chain box cover
should be taken off regularly, approx, every two months.
Grease cups are provided on the depth control wheel and stub
axle assembly and they should be tightened down at least twice per
day. Plugs are provided for oil in the gear drive box and on the jackshaft
and rotar on the drive end.
It would be advisable, if you wish our machine to do what you
expect it is capable of handling, to dismantle the cultivator and
thoroughly clean all working parts after every few months' work, or
more frequently, especially on the drive and stub axle ends of the rotar.
