PATENT
GOLD-SAVING MACHINE,
For Dry or Wet Process.
The above cut represents the " Miners’ Friend ” Gold-Saving Machine—the
simplest and most perfect machine for saving gold by dry process yet invented.
Some of its advantages over all others are; —
That it saves with certainty all kinds of gold from the finest flour gold
to nuggets.
It is strongly made, and complete within itself, and can be placed in
working order within 15 minutes.
Its construction is extremely simple, having neither bellows, fans, nor
artificial blast of any description, and no gearing to get out of
order and break down.
The daily trials prove its capacity to treat auriferous material at the rate of
three tons per hour, and recover more gold than any other dry process machine
(set Press Reports).
It stands about 3 ft. 6 in. high ; 28 in. diameter ; weight 40 lbs. ; stand extra.
Through the simple motion required, anyone can at once work it without previous
gold-mining experience.

Routes to the Goldfields.
COOLGARDIE.
This field has become famous from the numerous rich finds,
notably, Bayley’s Reward and the Londonderry. It is situated
about 352 miles from Perth. The railway from Perth is open as
far as Southern Cross, 236 miles. Fares approximately : First-
class, £1 ; Second-class, £2. Thence to Coolgardie by coach.
An alternative route is to take the train at Albany, and proceed
to Southern Cross. This route is three days quicker than going
by steamer to Fremantle, and thence by train to Southern Cross ;
and, although it involves a somewhat longer railway journey, the
rough sea trip round the Leuwin is avoided. The route from
Southern Cross is as follows :—To Morlinnong Rock is 29 miles,
Karalee 32, Koorarawalyee 42, Boorabbin Rock VVoolgangee
Dams Yerdi 81+, Gnarlbine 101, and Coolgardie 16 miles
further. (See Map.)
Cost of living at Coolgardie, under canvas, may be estimated
at £2 to £2 ios, per week.
THE MURCHISON GOLD-FIELDS.
The principal town of these fields is Cue, situated about 264
miles from Geraldton, the nearest port, which is 300 miles from
Perth by steamer.
Mcllwraith, McEacharn & Co.’s Limited steamers proceed to
Geraldton direct, without necessity, in most cases, of transhipping
at Fremantle. Passengers proceed either direct by coach from
Geraldton to Cue, or by rail from Geraldton to Mullewa, 60 miles,
and thence by coach. Coach fare from Geraldton to Cue, £S ;
from Mullewa to Cue, £s. Horse teams and camels proceed to
other parts of the fields as required. Freight by team from
Geraldton to Cue is £23 per ton. Cost of living at the Murchison
about 355. per week, while wages range from £$ 10s. to £\.

PILBARRA AND BAMBOO CREEK GOLD-FIELDS.
This field, situated in the North-West, about 250 miles from
Cossack, is considered one of the most promising mineral areas in
Western Australia. Up to the end of 1892 the return of gold from
this field was 26,000 oz. Latterly it has been much more
developed, and many prospectors are trying here in preference to
the Murchison or Coolgardie. The nearest port to the fields is
Cossack Roads, and passengers can be booked through by
Mcllwraith, McEacharn & Co.’s line, changing steamers at
Fremantle, whence they have a steamer of this line, leaving
monthly for Cossack. Passengers can proceed by sailing vessel to
Condon (fare, £2), and thence by team to the field, 90 miles; or
they can proceed direct from Cossack to the fields, 250 miles.
The cost of getting from the port to the fields should not exceed
£$ to an experienced miner.
General Information.
During the past two years Mcllwraith, McEacharn & Co.
Limited have despatched more tonnage from the Eastern Colonies
to Western Australia than any other firm. They have, therefore,
been able, from their large experience of the trade, to adapt their
steamers specially to the requirements of passengers and shippers,
and can offer greater facilities than any other line. Their fares
and rates are always the lowest current at any given time.
Saloon Passengers’ accommodation is of a very high Order,
and a first-class table is kept which would satisfy the most fastidi-
ous.
Steerage Passengers receive most careful attention, and are
liberally catered for, Mcllwraith, McEacharn & Co. recognizing
that the success of a service largely depends on this class of
passengers. Bedding and table requisites are supplied free of
charge ; all food is of the best quality, and well served. The

ample deck space of their steamers is an inestimable boon to
steerage passengers, who on most steamers are cooped up with
barely room to move about, owing to deck space being crowded
with cargo and stock.
Stock.— A special feature is made of carrying stock, and they
have been most successful in securing a minimum loss during
1893-1894. Stalls and water are provided free of charge, but
shippers must supply their own fodder. Experienced officers,
accustomed to deal with stock, are employed in these steamers,
this fact ensuring their safety to a very great extent. If it is
desired, insurance can be effected at lowest rates, covering all risks
from port to port.
CUSTOMS DUTIES

imported by passengers :

INSIST ON HAVING
FITZROY BRAND
PRESERVED MEATS
And do not let your Merchant or Grocer
sell you any other.
They are not packed from the refuse meat of
butchers’ shops, but from Prime Fat approved
Cattle only, and, not having to be hurriedly cooked,
time is taken in their preparation, by which all the
nutriment and flavour of the meat is retained, therefore
their Excellence is undeniable. •
THEY ARE SOLD EVERYWHERE.
