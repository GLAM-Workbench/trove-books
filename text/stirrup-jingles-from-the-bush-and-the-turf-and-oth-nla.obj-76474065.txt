TO THE MEMORY OF ADAM LINDSAY GORDON.
To your dear memory, poet horseman lying
In that calm realm of deep and dreamless rest,
Whither, in long procession hourly hieing,
Forever march the bravest and the best,
1 dedicate these feeble measures, knowing
How poor the offering is I faltering make
To one whose ringing lines were ever flowing
In harmony that knew not halt or break.
Yet, generous-hearted friend and gallant rider,
1 feel that could you come from other lands,
This tribute from an all-unknown outsider
At least would fall in sympathetic hands ;
For you would know that I have heard the rattle
Of timber struck by quickly-tiring feet,
That dear to me are scenes where horses battle
On swards resounding to their swift hoofs? beat.
That I have strayed through sombre forests lonely,
And lived the life so dimly here portrayed,
And that, although a feeble climber only,
I trod the pathways by my muse essayed,
While if about my lines there may be clinging
Some shreds of fancy brighter than my own,
They have been caught through listeningto yoursinging,
And have amidst my duller dreamings grown.
So Gordon, on your ashes I am leaving
These aimless rhymes of bush and mine and race,
Doubting, in truth, if their crude clumsy weaving
May be quite worthy of such hallowed place.
Still, as they are the best that I can pi?offer,
I place them o?er the dust from which they grew,?
Well knowing that in spite of foe and scoffer,
They would have found a kindly friend in you.

GRAND NATIONAL STEEPLECHASE MEETING,
12th JUNE, 1887.
There is dust in the air, and a grinding
Of tires on the wheel-weary way,
As, all swaying, and swerving, and winding,
Speed crowds of the grave and the gay
Past the balconies teeming with faces,
And pathways alive with the feet
Of the dwellers in -dank noisome places?
The growth of the alley and street.
Loaded ?buses are groaning and creaking
Under sons of pleasure and toil,
And the vans and the buggies are reeking
With vultures that haste to the spoil.
Here the hoodlum in wondrous made vesture,
That mocks at the pipe ?tween his lips,
Looks aloft with an insolent gesture,
To sneer at the four-in-hand ?whips,??
Steering drags crowned with fashion and brightness,
Where out from the folds of rich lace
(Made still fairer by frames of frail whiteness)
Shines many a beautiful face.
Stand aside ! all a-glitter with mounting
Comes a carriage whose panels are rich


With the crest and quart?rings past counting,
Of one who was reared in a ditch ;
Gleams a ring on each short stumpy finger,
On which, when out purchasing gold,
?Tis averred that more dust used to linger,
Than ever by diggers was sold.
Hip hurrah ! past the trees that are drooping
With dust that has gathered again,
On they go to a carnival trooping,
Where succulent pigeons are slain.
But the fun of the thing, O ! my masters !
Is that the pigeons still try,
In the face of a thousand disasters,
With the hawks and eagles to fly.
On they sweep ?a wild mingling of laughter,
Of hoof-beats, and champing of bits;
While yet faster and faster comes after,
The car in which Nemesis sits.
So they pass through the gates open swinging
The gentle, the simple, the rooks,
As afar on the hot air is ringing
The hoarse-noted roar of the ? Books.?
In the Leger the ? Monties ? are shouting;
And ?Buttoners? capture the pea,
To show ?Arry?here for an outing,
That all such amusements are free
From the guile which they tell him disgraces
The sports that are played by the ? nobs
While the confidence which he misplaces
Is causing a dearth of his ? bobs.?


From their boxes the ? Rats ? are proclaiming
The odds at a price which should tell
To all save the novice in gaming,
That to win is to bid farewell
To the ? sov ? which the favourite carries?
Should that animal chance to win,
For ?tis seldom indeed the ? Rat? tarries
When the luck of the 1 backer ? is in.
On the lawn, which each oath nearly reaches,
Two gorgeous robed plutocrats stand,
With tire bloom on their cheeks as on peaches?
Their rouge is the very best brand.
See, they carry their plumage right bravely?
If grammar be somewhat astray,
One was born?and I?m now speaking gravely,
In a hammock swung under a dray.
And the other when poorer and younger,
Is said to have juggled witli life,
While engaged in appeasing her hunger,
By eating new peas with a knife.
But no matter, she gives us good dinners,
And the past is hallowed by gold,
For at best we are dainty-toothed sinners?
By a chef to be bought or sold.
?Mid the rustle of richly-wrought dresses
A sprig of nobility strolls,
While the women he languid addresses
Know well in their innermost souls,
That for love they will never be taken?
No matter how fair to his eye?


By a man who has seldom mistaken
The paths where his interests lie.
Stay, however, he has not a shilling?
His title is all he is worth,
And, perchance, as a spec he?ll be willing
Bor their gold to barter his birth ;
So the daughters of Croesus are sighing
For the time this idler may deign
(?If by Jove, the old man?s not too trying! ?)
To sell them his thorough-bred name.
Arm in arm with a squatter patrolling,
The member for Blowhole comes now,
Seeking respite awhile from log-rolling?
The care of the state off his brow.
He can pose as the hope of a nation,
And is pained at the thought of pay,
But a hundred might buy his salvation,
If put in a delicate way.
Through the crushing and hum of arriving
Sound strains of the National air,
As, his bright-coated four-in-hand driving,
The Governor stops at the stair.
Ah, though chased by addresses and speeches,
And bound to the vice regal mill,
He at least has?what man seldom reaches?
The whole of a Country?s good-will.
All the course fast is filling with people,
And the paddock ringing with noise,
For the ? Books ? in the Hurdle and Steeple
Have opened with Goodwood for choice


And the Knights whose descent goes no farther,
Than a sire they don?t care to know,
And Companions of Orders who rather
Consider caligraphy low,
Are ?chumming? and talking with fellows
Professedly up in such things
As ?stiff?uns,? and ?shorts in the bellows,?
When sharply the warning-bell rings.
In the jockeys? room trainers are fixing
Their leads, getting ready to weigh ;
In the paddock the public are mixing
Bets, fast as the ? Bookies ? will lay ;
While the man who is looked on as cunning
Is followed by fools who request,
With a constant and wearisome dunning,
? Just tell us, old man, what?s the best??
But the horses are marshalled, and Dargin
Stands ready to open the play ;
Then there sounds o?er the turmoil and jargon,
The many voiced roar, ? They?re away ! ?
Even now as they sweep round the corner,
Invictus is seen in the front,
While, the pace growing warmer and warmer,
Glenduart is out of the hunt.
Bound the bend they have dashed, and their faces
Are turned for the hurdle that stands
In the straight, and, I tell you, the pace is
A trial for hearts and for hands ;
There?s a crash as the hurdle is shattered,
A mass which lies prone on the course,


For a rider, all bleeding and battered,
Is crushed ?neatli the weight of his horse
Brave old Bullion?s racing is ended,
But ?tis little the public care,
? What is broken can never be mended,?
And the nags that their guineas bear
Are all in the hunt, save the grey horse
Whose nostrils are wet with distress ;
And the passions that burn on a racecourse
Count as little one jockey the less.
Still Invictus the running is forcing,
See, he holds the field in command,
As, the turf from their flying hoofs tossing,
They race past the long Leger stand ;
But Balmoral is close on his quarters,
As striking the hurdle he slips,
And then, as he stumbles and falters,
?Mid a shouting, and whistling of whips.
Balmoral?the hope of the double?
Runs up like a racehorse to win,
While the backers forget all their trouble
In the clang of the many-tongued din ;
But stay ! on the outside is flashing
The silk of a rider in green,
And, out from the ruck swiftly dashing,
The colours of Yeomans are seen,
As Corrigan chasing the ? moral ?
Comes forth like a shot from a gun,
And catching and beating Balmoral,
The Hurdle is lost and is won.


The jockeys are weighed, and the people,
?Mid clatter of chatter and munch,
Are picking the horse for the Steeple,
Through fumes of a five-shilling lunch.
But time that for ever is fleeting,
Bings up for another event,
And the men who have lost on the Meeting
Pour out ?on recovery bent.
Here a gentleman lengthy of collar
Has W. Kelso in tow,
You may stake to your uttermost dollar
On the little that party will know,
When, smiling a smile that is child-like,
Bill tells him of wonderful spins
By a horse that, if speedy, is wild-like,
And of numerous by-gone wins ;
For Bill is a scorner of cunning
When fast in the claws of a bore,
Never given to rigging or running,
Still he leaves him wise as before.
Here two races are run, and the horses
That carry the violet-and-gold
Have won, which a matter of course is,
At least so by winners you?re told ;
They swear that they knew all about it,
That Oxenham told them, in fact,
While a man is a fool who could doubt it,
When by such a deity backed.
And now comes the race of all races,
The sight that seems dear to us all.


Though death sits at dangerous places,
And life may be dropped at a fall.
They are off! And the people are crowding
Like grains of the wind-hurried sand,
While fair ones their faces are shrouding,
As the horses steam down to the Stand,
With wild-hearted Omeo leading
The field that race on in his rear,
As rider or reins hardly heeding
He races the treble to clear;
On they charge with a rush and a rattle
Of panels by flying hoofs struck,
Brave riders and stout-hearted cattle,
From leader to last in the ruck ;
Ah ! there at the fence near the railing,
The favourite Wymlet runs round,
See, after the others he?s sailing,
With Corrigan dragged on the gi?ound ;
Now Omeo?s tender spots find him,
And Scobeloff jumps in the van,
While the others are racing behind him
As only bold-hearted ones can ;
But the pace is a cracker, and pounded,
Old Trickett ? turns turtle ? at last,
While just as his doom has been sounded,
The die of St. Dunstan is cast,
And Scobeloff leads to the paling,
Where Studley swerves, lingers, and reels
While the public are shouting, ? he?s failing ! ?
? Old Goodwood will show him his heels ! ?


For King on the favourite is riding
A gallant and desperate race,
And they fancy his turn he was biding,
To smother the others by pace ;
But Watson has set Studley going,
And Threadgate has plenty in hand,
And Goodwood the foam back is throwing,
As they race past the roar of the Stand
Of ? Goodwood can never get near him ! ?
? Old Scobeloff wins all the way !?
As loudly the bookmakers cheer him,
For, have not the ? backers ? to pay !
There is woe in the hearts of the many,
And coin in the fobs of the few,
While those who have ? lost every penny,?
Are looking uncommonly blue ;
But no matter, with Fig Tree a starter?
An animal voted ? real jam,?
From squatter to cabman and carter,
Once more down their dollars they ram,
Though young Fielder is up on a black one?
A demon ?tis whispered for pace,
And Gorry is walking a hack, one
Would sooner see out of the race,
And Phaon is fighting with Harris,
While Oxenham?s pages are thick
With figures I fear will embarrass
Those gentlemen working on ? tick.?
By the men who hold glasses unsteady
With doubting, the start is proclaimed,
And, up from the Grand-stand already
A dozen of winners are named,


As the fears and the wishes make fathers
To hundreds of agonized hopes,
That the demon of gambling gathers
To rage on the feet-trampled slopes.
Round the turn they have swung, and the flashing
Of colours is bright in the sun,
As young Fielder Invader is dashing
To the front, and Figtree is done,
While hands to the palings are clinging,
And lips are all parched with desire,
As Harris the chestnut is bringing
o o
Through horses that falter and tire ;
On, on past the Stand which is swaying
V
With billows of hope and of fear,
On, on, mid a whirl of hurrahing,
On, on till the post is so near
That the backers declare he has won it,
That Oxenham?s luck never fails,
? With that weight how could Honeydew run it 1 ?
When Gorry appears on the rails
Like a flash from the masses that thunder,
Or a stone from Vesuvius tost,
And ere men can question or wonder,
The top-weight is first past the post.
All is over, and cabmen are cursing
The fares they are never to find,
While the ? brokers ? full sadly are nursing
The debts they would fain leave behind,
And the winners are fondly caressing
The thoughts of their judgment and pluck,


When, forsooth, they should only be blessing
The length and the run of their luck.
So, smirched with the dust that is whirling
From wheels through the voice-laden air,
Where the hoofs of the horses are hurling
Dirt back in the face of despair,
All are hurrying in to the city?
The shearers and those that are shorn,
Fitting subjects for dread and for pity?
Of guile and extravagance born ;
Still, boil them, and stir them together,
And I fancy with me you?ll agree
?Twould be awkward indeed to tell whether
From roguery fleeced ones are free ;
It would strike you, in watching them boiling,
That most of the public are rooks,
Who are secretly stupidly toiling
To hoodwink and ?get at? the ?Books,?
While the layers are eagles we know of,
The hackers are kites we despise,
With seldom much cuteness to blow of,
And that?s where the difference lies.


BUSH SKETCHES.
Jftustcr,
The Stockyard posts are rotten,
And weeds the panels fill;
The stockmen are forgotten,
Their whips for ever still.
Clone is the rush and rattle
Of pikers on the rails,
When wings were full of cattle,
And thongs came down like flails.
No more the hoofs of horses
May sound across the plain,
Like roar of mountain courses
When mad with winter rain.
For those they owned as masters
Have other Master now ;
The lands that were their pastures
Are given to the plough.
It may be for the better,
I neither know nor care ;
They could not write a letter,
But could both do and dare.


While horsemen who are growing
Appear to me hand fed,
Much less for work than blowing?
Less sterling than the dead.
They talk about their hunting?-
Three fences and a log ;
Where sport means panel shunting,
And pace a decent jog.
It may be all they boast of,
This sport for gods and kings,
Where gaps are made the most of,
By queer high-collared things.
But to the men who sought out,
And rode at nobler game,
Where battles grim were fought out,
Say I, if some remain,
Why court a second childhood
Mid scenes of talk and bragl
Why mock the distant wildwood
By following a drag 1
Full many suns have yellowed
The bloom on wattle trees,
And many years have mellowed
My life by sure degrees,
Since last I heard the neighing
On hills where horses browse,
Or felt my body swaying
- To miss the hanging boughs ;


As through the scruh-lands rushing,
O?er stones and fallen trees,
The lighter timber brushing
With shoulders and with knees,
We followed them a cracker
Ten miles without a check,
Where even going slacker
Was rough on limbs and neck.
?Twas in the One-tree Gully,
Dan Godfrey cried a go,
And Prince came down with Tully
Above the Overflow.
I saw the stallion dashing
Ten lengths in front of King,
When through the timber crashing,
Brown took the other wing.
I heard the hoofs? loud thunder,
As, riding like a trump,
Without a miss or blunder
He wheeled and shot them plump
Among the mob of ? tailers,?
Where, riled and cursing we
Saw all the loafing ? whalers ?
At grass and swilling tea.
And ere their girths were tightened
And legs were thrown across,
We found that we were lightened
Of every hard-won horse.


There was no time for swearing
Such as the case deserved,
As through the timber tearing,
We neither swayed nor swerved.
While horse had wind to follow,
Or man had luck to pass
Soft patches in the hollow,
Or stump holes in the grass,
We met them in the gullies,
And pressed them on the plains,
Till sweat, that stains and sullies,
Made slippery our reins;
While outlaws back were flinging
Foam-fle'cks from weary lips,
And all the air was ringing
With shouts and cracking whips.
I think I?m right in saying,
?Twas on the cattle run,
I felt my old horse swaying?
Sure sign that he was done;
But four men still were riding
Like demons on their tails,
With whips and voices guiding
Each hoof between the rails.
Thus of three and twenty horsemen,
Who started on their track?
(Though might be found far worse then)
But four had brought them back.


Skeleton QLvzzk.
Where leaves are wet with tears of spring,
And odours rare of wattle bloom
Float on the breath of winds that bring
From forest depths a strange perfume
Of scent distilled from tender leaves,
And waving grass and forest flowers ;
(For living mid them who believes
No fragrance fills the Austral bowers) ?-
By feet of gums whose topmost limbs
Debar the glare with ramparts green,
A silver streak of curves and whims,
The hurrying creek sings on unseen
Save by the birds who bathe them there,
Or skim athwart its rippling breast,
That from its bosom they may bear
Some insect to their leafy nest;
Or beasts that come when suns are low
From wilder depths of scrub and glen,
And barren plains where fancies glow,
And gleam, and break the hearts of men.
Who, lost amid the drear expanse,
Behold with eyes by torture dimned
Great phantom lakes whose waters dance
Through isles and trees, by demons limned


To lure them on with fevered haste
That they may find but sand and stones,
And help to fill the ghoulish waste
With broken hearts and bleaching bones.
Yet, it were wrong to say the creek
Knew only things that creep or fly,
For one who both could think and speak
Had come beside its stream to die.
Who he had been, or why he came
Through barren lands of sun and thirst,
It matters not, since praise or blame
For him had done its best or worst;
The form that once might laugh or weep
Has mingled with its parent clay ;
In mouldering bones foul insects creep,
And mock their god of yesterday.
In days to come some other eyes
Perchance may find what I have seen;
But, to the one who vainly tries
To fathom what that past had been,
And strives to trace by place or sign
If days with him were good or ill?
How much of gall, and what of vine
Had gone his cup of life to fill?
I this would say : the past belongs
For ever to yon crumbling sod ;
Ho part of thine his sins or wrongs,?
His final judge, not man, but God.


Ihtshcb.
Tis night once more, my horse is done,
No sign of life is there !
Surely I know that blasted gum?
I?ve seen that hill-top bare.
But why thus strain my wearied eye 1
Why need I memory tax 1
For there?in yonder basin dry,
I see my morning tracks.
Merciful God ! Have pity on me !
Cooee ! Cooee ! Cooee-ee-ee !
I see my old horse prick his ears;
Is it an answering hail ?
Ah no, alas ! He only hears
Some wandering night-bird?s wail.
Oh Christ! And must I perish thus 1
?Tis fearful here to die !
What, there again 1 Hush, old horse, hush !
I?ll give it one more try ?
Merciful God ! Have pity on me !
Cooee ! Cooee ! Cooee-ee-ee !
An answer ! ?Tis the fiendish bird
That thus derides my pain ;
And yet ?I thought a voice I heard ;
Yes?there it is again !
One effort more, your last and mine,
Truest of friends though dumb ;


See through the trees, their torches shine,
At last relief has come !
Merciful God ! Thanks unto Thee.
Cooee ! Cooee ! Cooee-ee-ee !
|Uaxk liing?s <SkuU.
One night, when round the walls with dismal shrieks
The winds of winter blew,
And sudden rains had filled the forest creeks
With yellow floods anew.
From looking on the dark and angry sky
I faced the firelight?s blaze;
And, lulled to musing by the storm-king?s cry,
I thought of early days ;
Then glanced up to a corner dim of light,
And saw there, peering down,
A black man s skull?where age had changed the white
To dull and dusky brown.
And, gazing, watched its fleshless lips slow part,
While on the silence fell
A sound of words that struck my very heart
Like some wild mournful knell.
But as the language like the race is dead
In which his tale he told,
I may forthwith interpret what he said
In accents harsh and cold.


? Why dids?t thou move me from the forest graves.
Where, still for fifty years,
I slept among my long-forgotten braves?
Full armed with shield and spears?
In quiet resting till the promised hour
When, rising up again?-
With faces white, my dusky race will scour
Once more o?er hill and plain?
Yet, prying white man, list while I unfold
A page of early strife !
And tell thee how I lost?in days now old,
Alike my love and life.
Of yore, when I was king among my race?
A chief by all obeyed,
I met one evening in a far drawn chase
A lithe-lirabed laughing maid?
Princess of another tribe who hated
My own since early years ;
A tribe who, rather than behold us mated,
Had sunk their fire-tipped spears
Deep in her breast : But still she loved me well
With wild untutored ways ;
And, ere the sultry noons of summer fell??
In chilly winter days,
She fled with me across the dank lagoons ?
To where my people?s camp
Lay distant through the forest many moons
Of weary devious tramp.


But as we lay at rest one stormy night,
Cat-like her brothers crept ?
Led to our mia-mia by the camp-fire light,
And slew us as we slept.
My warriors found us steeped in blood and rain ;
And, sadly, in one tomb
Buried both king and bride, so ruthless slain,
Amid the forest gloom.
Finished my story : Be thy fate the same,?
The gruesome relic said,
? Who dared to move with idle hands profane
The helpless sleeping dead !?
?tEta |3ush Jfirt.
In days when breath comes short and fast,
And birds are still with stifling heat;
While clouds of dust are upwards cast
By weary cattle?s lagging feet;
When winds that come are dry and hot,
From burning forests filled with flames,
And horses seek each shaded spot,
With reeking sides and drooping manes j
In times of drought, when all the land
Is full of glare and torrid heat;
When streams are only gleaming sand,
To mock and blister thirsty feet ;


When thunders roll and lightnings flash,
And all the sky is wild and red,
As mighty storm-clouds onward dash,
To join aerial combat dread,
All pitiless, alas, they soar,
Forgetful through the heated air?
Then tearless pass, nor stoop to pour
The life they in their bosoms bear :
?Tis then the fiery demon springs
From forests thick with scrub and pine.
To scorch and blast all living things,
From sturdy box to clinging vine.
Above his path the air is dark
With clouds that speak of fear and death.
While gleaming sparks of leaf and bark
Are borne upon his baneful breath.
The smoke in heavy circles floats,
That hour by hour decrease in size,
While men stand still with parching throats.
To gaze with terror-stricken eyes
Upon the sun that, sinking low
Behind the hill-heads brown and bare,
Seems like some demon?s face aglow
With thirst and anguish and despair.
And through the dust hurrying past
Great droves of cattle, and the goods
Of those in other days who cast
Their lot among the deeper woods ;


While in their rear the bushmen wage
A losing battle all night long,
Where all the air is full of rage
And smoke and death and fiendish song.
Once and again they dash their boughs
Against the crackling ruddy line
That licks their sweat-besprinkled brows,
And makes them reel as though with wine ;
About their feet the insects crawl,
That live in rot and noisome shades;
Above their heads great monarchs fall,
Struck to the heart by fiery blades.
And gliding on from log to log,
Snakes hurry by with sinuous haste,
While kangaroo and native dog
With terror fly the burning waste.
God help the flocks they cannot bring;
The cattle, mad with smoke and pain ;
The birds that have not strength of wing;
The men who fly when flight is vain!
For back the fighters fall at last,
With swollen tongues and blistered feet;
And trees are laid before the blast
As reapers slay the ripened wheat.
* * *
?Tis night once more, and all around
A thousand watchfires light the scene ;
The fire-king holds the conquered ground,
And rests where forest homes have been.


While on the morrow, o?er the smoke
That hangs above the cursed place,
Will eagles fly with regal stroke
O?er blacken?d stump and blasted face ;
And foetid things will scent the prize,
And come to gloat with reeking breath,
And fight, and fill with furious cries
This land of ruin and of death.
(Dlb (Shcphcrh.
Deep in the shades of an Australian forest,
Built from such trees as round it shadows cast,
Stands a rude hut, now but a ruined relic
Of early station days for ever past.
Weird shreds of bark hang from the whitened rafters,
And, swinging by a withered thong of hide,
One of its roof-sheets moves with creaking cadence,
Urged by the winds that through the slab-cracks
glide.
Gone the bark door, whence the hut-keeper nightly
Looked for the lagging shepherd?s slow return;
Mouldering the blackened logs on grass grown
hearthstone,
Where once the crackling pine-sticks used to burn.
All speaks of solitude and long desertion;
Over yon fold the weeds grow rank and long,
Covered with moss lie broken hurdles, rotting,
Tokens of shepherd ways that now have gone.


Well I remember when its latest tenant
Left the lone hut to travel unknown lands ;
Silent I watched his hour-glass swiftly running,
Till few and wavering were its fleeting sands.
Still w T as the sultry noon, except when broken
By the old shepherd?s wild uneven words,
As now again he drove his sheep to pasture,
Or scared the dingo from the sleeping herds ;
Or shouted to his faithful dog, who sadly
Seemed to be brooding o?er its master?s pain,
Licking his hands, with anxious dumb affection?
To catch that master?s eye, but all in vain.
?Twas near the end, the old man?s troubles left him,
And o?er the sea his spirit seemed to steal?
To sit beside a long-forgotten mother,
And watch her swiftly spinning at the wheel.
For, when the summer sun, in splendour sinking,
About the distant hills appeared to cling,
And all the birds, in mighty concert, uttered
A noisy farewell to the dying king?
He whispered to his mother words of welcome,
While on his face a gleam of light was shed,
And, eager, stretching out his arms to clasp her,
The last sand vanished, and the spirit fled.


YARNS BY OLD STAGERS.
JV Iplack Reckoning.
? You want to know why I?ve wandered away
Alone like a beaten dog ??
Said the old sheep super Harrison Grey
? Well, take a seat on the log ;
And here, as you don?t seem given to chaff?
A fool?s own game at the best,
I?ll tell you the reason?now, boy, don?t laugh !
I once was loved like the rest.
?Tis not always right to judge of a life
From the end that is nearly done ;
God knows in the past that I dreamt of a wife,
A true woman?s love had won.
For in spite of all you youngsters may think,
When you see me sit and soak
A weary brain almost sodden with drink,
And rusted by dust and smoke,
I once had a heart that knew how to beat
At a word by a woman said,
Had an eye that could trace her dainty feet,
And an ear that loved their tread.
Boy, I?ve heard them say is these later years,
No woman could share my lot;


They can mind their business, and keep their sneers ;
My life is mine, is it not 1
No, you need not explain, for I don?t mean you, ?
Perhaps in the main they?re right;
After all it is neither rare nor new
To sum up a man at sight;
Why should I squirm at the views of those
For whom I don?t care a curse 1
We are atoms at best that each chance wind blows
About for better or worse.
No doubt it may strike you as somewhat queer,
To find me in such a strain,?
Boy, this very day in a long past year,
The woman I loved was slain ;
And each wilted blade of the drought-dried grass
To-night has deep red dye,
And though you may deem me a drivelling ass,
I swear the stain is not dry ;
In each deepening shade lurks a coward foe,
A spear in his dusky hand ;
While out of the brigalow seems to grow
A house near a creek of sand ;
And shrill on the wings of the sultry breeze,
Strike like a knell on my ear
Dread shrieks. They live in the holes of the trees ?
To steal on me every year.
I?ll give you the tale, though I tell you straight,
There?s little to tempt the taste,
In the telling of women?s gruesome fate,
And a happy home laid waste.


But at least I know, and it comfort gives
In a sinful savage way,
That no single soul of the tribe now lives
Whose hands were at work that day.
The scene lies many a mile from here,
And long are the gloomy years,
Yet, to-day it seems in my mind so near,
That I see the blood-stained spears.
I was then, say, a man of twenty-eight,
As slim and as straight as you,
With never a trouble to addle my pate?
The whole of the world in view.
I managed the cattle on Manneroo West,
Well liked by master and men,
Reckoned a rider not far from the best
Who yarded wild cattle then.
I think on the run, from storeman to cook,
We mustered two dozen, all told, ?
Men who at danger could steadily look?
As usually bought and sold.
We had fun enough in a wild sort of way,
If riding brumbies be so ;
But still you may guess how we blessed the
Macdonald took up ? The Blow,?
For we heard, as well, that the girls would
With him at least for a while,
And there wasn?t a man not ready to give
His hand for a woman?s smile.
I had met old Mac when I was a lad,
And he was counted a swell;


God only knows how he went to the had,
For he kept his secret well ;
But I?m sure at least that his tough old heart
Had a heavy load to bear,
Though he took his ? gruel,? and played his part,
As one who the worst must dare.
His ? diggings ? was only a largish hut,
Built on the bank of the creek,
And though?twenty miles by the nearest cut,
Some of us went every week ;
For to us each nook of the old slab place
Was lit by the sunny curls,
And filled with the lithesome and winning grace
Of his two motherless girls.
Macdonald had three thousand sheep or less,
And as he was clean played out,
His son and himself and his old slut Jess
Did shepherding turn about.
The girls kept house ?if a house you can call
A humpy without a lock,
With a door where a man who chanced to be tall
His head was certain to knock.
Full often I told him he risked a lot
There where the niggers were bad ;
He laughed at my words and quoted some rot ?
For he had the usual fad
Of people who write from their country seats
Of wilds they have never trod?
To say that kindness the savage defeats,
If allied to faith in God.


Boy, do you fancy a white man would stand
Out from home to be driven,
Because the usurper held out his hand,
And asked to be forgiven.
You reckon not. Then what folly to say
A savage is to be won
By kindness, when those who come in his way
Are weak, and don?t keep a gun.
Man?s heart is selfish enough at the best,
And, to a certain extent,
I fear that, in truth, if all were confessed,
Some of my interest meant
That his youngest daughter a chord had struck
Deep down in my inmost heart?
In fact I was well in front of the ruck,
And had the rails from the start.
I know there were better men in the race,
But a woman?s love is won
Bull often by him who has pluck to face
And take the fort at a run.
Be that as it may, where the myall shades
On the golden grasses fall,
When birds were asleep in the leafy glades-,
I won her for good and all.
I tell you the words from the lips that fell
On the summer air that night.
O 7
Have striven and stood ?twixt myself and hell,
In many a mental fight;


For I loved Imr, boy, though it strange may seem
But, stay, the subject we?ll leave ;
A woman?s love is too sacred a theme
For one to wear on his sleeve.
We were saddling up for a longish spell
Of work at the West Bun ? licks,?
And had fixed our swags, I remember well,
When, up through the dead-wood sticks
Dashed the tracker Jack on a sweat stained nag
Bare-backed and rowel-ripped,
While the black boy himself had every rag
From his sooty carcase stripped ;
He jabbered away till I had to swear
If he did not change his style,
I would hang him up by his greasy hair
To collect his thoughts awhile ;
But at last we caught from his broken talk,
That the blacks had burned ? The Blow,?
That he?d seen them with spear and tomahawk
Every living thing lay low.
There were twenty men on their horses? backs,
And twenty swags on the ground,
Ere the black boy?s jaws had time to relax
From utt?ring their latest sound ;
And a savage crew through the slip-rails dashed
A film of blood in each eye,
And silently into the scrub-land crashed?
A rifle behind each thigh.
We were all "well armed ; for in those wild days
Sudden death was apt to hang


In each heavy shade ; and most wore the graze
Of some swift-thrown boomerang.
o %
So although I feared we would not be there
To rescue my darling Nell,
Stil at least I might feed my mad despair
With a vengeance swift and fell.
I led all the rest by more than a length
Through timber and rotten plains ;
For a deeper dread had given me strength,
And love was guiding my reins.
We found at the end what we feared to seek,
Mac dead in a sandy bed,
And scattered over the banks of the creek,
Sheep speared by blacks ere they fled ;
While, further on, at the butt of a tree,
One daughter and son lay slain.
But for her whose life was most dear to me,
I looked for a while in vain.
Ah, God ! in the shade were our vows were said
I caught the gleam of her hair,
But the golden locks had a deeper red
Than erst while had lingered there ;
Her wounded bosom lay bare to thelight?
Poor thing, as she heard my tread,
In a dying effort to hide the sight,
She fell in my arms stone dead.
And holding her there I told the still face,
For every stain on her breast,
I would have a life from the cursed race,
Ere I tasted food or rest.


They thought to fool us by crossing the creek ;
But we had a human hound,
Who could run the scent for a day or a week,
On broken or barren ground,
With an eye so keen, that a broken blade
Of grass was a finger-post,
While the slightest mark by a light foot made
Lay as the tramp of a host.
So we stood and watched till the searching black
At last made a silent sign,
That told us the sleuth-hound had found the track
In the scattered sprays of the pine.
And then like a hungry pack in full cry,
Or tigers that spring to feed,
We hurried behind through the scrublands dry
On their heels who did the deed.
And, just as the darkness was creeping on,
I caught a low warning sound,
And looking saw that the tracker was gone?
I guessed on what errand bound ;
So, watching the boughs that late had shut
His dusky form from our sight,
I saw through the green leaves his dark face cut,
His eyeballs gleam on the night.
They were camped, he said, on a saltbush plain
Not a mile from where we stood ;
Yes, the very dogs who the girls had slain?
For he brought a woman?s hood,
Which must have been dropped by the flying band,
As, darkly traced on the white,


Was the ghastly print of a human hand?
Standing out against the light.
I took it from him, but not a man spoke,
It seemed to act as a spell,
But fierce in each horseman?s heart there awoke
A fury as deep as hell.
We tethered our horses within the wood ;
God knows they must have been glad,
For their reeking sides were ruddy with blood,
While our leggings were as bad ;
And creeping along with a stealthy tread,
We followed the lean-limbed guide,
Who flitted across the fallen leaves dead,
With swift and serpent-like glide ;
Till at last we saw through the thick-set brush
A camp of thirty or more ;
But I sternly held back the wished-for rush,
I had deeper end in store ;
And I made them surround the wretches camp,
And told them to pick their game,
Who, gorged and tired, never heard our tramp,
But sat or stood by the flame.
Boy, I gave the order to shoot them all,
Were they old or babes at knee,
For the sight of a gin with poor Nell?s shawl
Made sex and age one to me.
?Twas a fearful scene ; and their dying yells
Still come to me in my sleep,


While a voice in my brain for ever tells
* As one sows so he must reap.?
Few fled from the spot for our blood was up,
And we shot down young and hoar,
Till filled to the brim was the crimson cup,
Accomplished the oath I swore.
When the last was slain, on their own camp-fire
We tossed both father and son,
And built from the brush their funeral pyre,
Not resting till it was done.
Then threw ourselves down on the blood-dyed grass,
Tired with the kill and the chase, ?-
Heaven knows we must have been weary to pass
A night in that fearful place.
The rest may have slept; lat least could not,
And, turning again to the blaze,
I sa*v through the glow of the dead wood hot
A corpse its charred fingers raise ;
It was but a muscle snapped by heat,
But I tell you, my boy, I thought
That fearsome being would rise to his feet,
And that it was I he sought.
For my rage had cooled, and I knew right well
That innocent blood was spilt,?
That the cries of those women would make a hell
To punish my savage guilt.
And it has been so ; for I swear to you
There flows between us for aye,
The blood of the weak and helpless I slew,
Through the oath I made that day.?


mt (Storkman?s (Dffmug.
Aluigiit, boss ! If a yarn I must spin,
Leastways it won?t be a cuffer,
Although, how this here pitch to begin
I don?t know, as I?m a duffer.
So, a-blowing the froth off the beer,
I?ll give you the strength of the stuff,.
For, you bet, if my language be queer,
At least it is truthful as rough.
Near twenty years come next October
I hired with a squatter out back,
At a pound a week and my dover,
Along of a joker named Jack.
We dossed in a hut on the station,
Did this covee called Jack and me,
And over our jolly tough ration,
Got chummy as chummy could be.
We were stockmen when running cattle
Meant saving your neck by your nerve ;
When life was a rush and a rattle,
With death in a falter or swerve ;
When pikers was ready and willing
A man or a fence to attack,
And the odds a pound to a shilling
?Gin the chap who got in their track.


When you slept your head in a saddle,
Your feet in the ashes at night,
And had to be ready to straddle
A brumbie or outlaw at sight.
But, where is the use of my talking
Of brumbies and pikers and sich,
So, early remembrances corking,
I?ll canter along with my pitch.
The squatter himself was a joker,
Who considered it only right
To miss being landed a broker
By working us both day and night.
But, somehow, he?d come by a daughter,?
W ell, boss ; I?m not good at romance,
But I guess the angels had brought her
To give us poor devils a chance
Out there in the scrub and the mallee?
Just to alter and mend our ways,
For, I swear, in the golden valley,
They?ll never a better one raise.
Now Jack, though he rode like a demon,
And branded a beast with the best,
Would sit in the evening and dream on,
A-resting his hand on his chest.
And so, when we got pretty chummy,
One night in the midst of a smoke,
First making me swear to be mum, he
Just told me as how he got broke


Through racing and women and gaming,
And how he had once been a toff?
But never a word, said he, blaming
The old man that shunted him off.
His breeding I always suspected,
For Jack had a thoroughbred face,
And, dull as I was, I detected
He came of a clean-timbered race.
I fancy as how the young lady
Guessed more than she offered to tell.
When she saw Jack lifting his cady
With the ease and the air of a swell.
But I?m near the end of my tether,
(Well thank you I don?t mind a swill).
?Twas right in the worst of the weather
The pet of the station, fell ill, ?
And kept getting weaker and weaker,
Till Jack said one evening to me, ?
? I?m afraid, Bill, the angels seek her,?
The angels from over the sea
That rolls ?twixt this life and a purer ;
And weary for sight of her face,
They have come with white wings to lure her
Away to that beautiful place.?
Any way, as we watched her that evening,
(Just to give the others a spell,)
In dreams she appeared to be weaving
A chain of the flowers she loved well, ??


While from white wan lips came a murmur,
For a lily to place with the rest, ?
Then, ?an echo, in tones scarce firmer,
? Ah ! God ! ?tis the flower she loves best I? 5,
As Jack, with his eyes wet and saddened,
Turned round till we stood face to face,
Saying, ? Bill, by it she?ll be gladdened,
The flower on her bosom I?ll place;?
Alongside the lake there?s a garden,
It?s not thirty-five miles away,
By riding old Junius hard, one
Might be back ere breaking of day ;
You watch by her side, Bill, old fellow,
And lad ! If I should be missed,
I think you may venture to tell her,
I?m bringing the flower that she wished.?'
He was gone. And I watched till starlight
Was fading away from the dawn,
When I saw in her eyes the far light,
That lately had burned there was gone.
While she asked with questioning wonder,
For what had become of poor Jack,
I heard in the distance the thunder
Of hoofs that were bringing him back.
I answered : ? The lilies he?s bringing,?
The lilies you asked for last night.?
Then, ?the door on its hinge soft swinging,
Jack stood in the gloom?ghastly white


And on up the room swiftly reeling,
One hand tightly pressed to his side,
O?er that hand the life-blood was stealing,
He vainly attempted to hide.
The leaves of the lilies were blotted,
That he laid on her quiv?ring breast,
The ribbon that bound them was clotted,
With his life that loved her the best.
? I have brought the lilies you spoke of
Last eve.? That was all that he said,
When the cord of his brave life broke off?
Snapt short at the side of the bed.
What had happened ? Well this is the story;
(So far I was able to know)
From the wound it seemed that before he
Had passed where the mallee scrubs grow,
He thought he?d be late, and so, daring
The dangers that lurk in that waste,
Raced on, neither heeding, nor caring
For aught in his desperate haste ;
Till some mallee shoot, ?sharp and blackened
Had found out and entered his side ;
Still, he never steadied nor slackened
The pace of his desperate ride,
But, staunching the blood that was flowing
Apace with the hand that was free,
Rode eight miles ?cross fences, well knowing
What the price of such riding must be.


His father,?a Duke or a something,
Wrote out, when he heard how he died,
(And I guess the same was a rum thing,
Considering his birth and his pride)
To say that he felt very sorry,
And what would they look on as fair
Repayment for trouble and worry
Thus caused by his son and his heir.
If sich be the grief of good breeding,
To h with such sorrow, say I,
Who witnessed, all shattered and bleeding,
A brave-hearted ne?er-do-well die.
For I hold so gallant an ending
Was worth all that useless remorse,
Which the world may reckon as mending
The holes of a sin-rutted course.
IE he (Shearer .Shorn.
The fire?s a bit low ; put those pine sticks
Round the billy, while I turn the cakes !
The damper we had at the ? salt licks,?
Was, I reckon, a caution to snakes.
It?s been a hard day at the muster,
And my throat?s just as dry as a board, ?
By the way, Tim ! Had Bruce a buster
At the fence near the Cattle-camp ford 1


That bottle looks summat suspicious,
Sticking out of the tail of Jack?s coat,
Tis ? Red Heart ? by all that?s delicious !
And a rattling good cure for sore throat.
As Jack?s gone the horses to water,
We had better I think take French leave ;
The way his liquor we?ll slaughter,
Boys, would make a Blue Ribboner grieve.
Will I make a fourth to play poker 1
Well, to-night, chaps, I guess that?s not me
Since I played with a mealy-faced joker,
It?s a game that with me don?t agree.
And, as I can?t sing you a ditty,
I may just as well spin you the yarn,
Which will show how a youth from the city
Walked through me in this very barn.
It sticks summat still in my gizzard
For to be, so to put it, done brown
By him what came up with Bill Izzard
The last time he tramped it from town.
Yes, boys, it was during last shearing
That the boss gave a penner the go,
The cause being?fondness for beering,
While the means was?the boss?s great toe.
A youth, with such excessive mildness,
That the ord?nary ways of a saint
By contrast would seem full of wildness,
With a manner, too, polished as paint,


Turned up, and said he was willin?
For to pen up and tar now and then,
Receiving per week twenty shillin?,
And taking his grub with the men.
Well, at night, as you know, after grubbing,
While some on us a ?baccy cloud blew,
And others their scissors were rubbing,
We staked it at poker and 100.
This night I had luck, and was raking
From the crowd to a largish extent,
When I saw the new penner taking
Great interest in every event.
Then he said he wouldn?t mind playing,
If we only would show him the way,
And finished us all up by saying
?Twas his custom each night for to pray.
Well I up and I made myself teacher,
In the hope that his cheque I would win.
And reckoned to lead that there teacher
Such a dance down the roadway of sin.
Now, just as the shearing was closing,
My new pupil had picked up enough
To help him, with my aid, in losing
Somewhere near to the half of his ? stuff.
We were paid, if I can remember,
Right close on to the end of the week ;
The time was well on in December,
And as hot as if hell?d sprung a leak.


Well, the penner, me, and another?
Seems I?ve somehow forgotten his name,
I think it was Jack Sheedy?s brother?
Stayed around just to have a last game.
I felt conscience prick me a trifle,
As I spotted the penner?s soft face,
And thought, ? Poor young devil to rifle
All your cheque is a shame and disgrace.?
So lads we played on until morning,
And then somehow the luck took a change,
(It must have been near about dawning)
In a manner alarming and strange.
The cards that youth held were surprising,
Good enough for the ?Heathen Chinee,?
While the way he kept it on rising,
Was far better to hear of than see.
It ended in us being brokers,
While the innocent?s pockets were packed
With notes won from us clever jokers,
By the cards, as, I now know, were stacked.
For, cuss me, as he tramped it away,
At us all a fair lunar he took,
And remarked, ? Well, I wish you good day,
Chaps ! I?m not quite so green as I look.?
And that?s why I can?t play at poker,
?Cause the thought of it makes me near mad,
When I think of that mealy-faced joker,
And the soft way in which we was had.


?Uhe (Stoagematt?s Jfiuh.
Very well, if I must, just fill up once more, ?
Now. Temple, pass on the bottle !
For a joker so small, as I said before,
You?ve a most capacious throttle.
It was in, let me see, about sixty-eight,
We were humping our drums ? out back,? ?
I may be a year or so wrong in the date, ?
Anyway we had lost the track.
And you know what that means on a cloudy day,
In a country flat as a flam,
With little or nothing to eat, I may say,
And miles from a tank or a dam,
Said Joe, ? let us make for the Tarran tree there,
Just to go into means and ways
For, of both we were scanty, as you may swear, ?
Having not seen a house for days.
Anyhow, up we went, and there, in the shade
Lay a tramp, his head on his swag :
Now, I ain?t much given to being afraid,
But I ain?t much given to brag?
So own to you straight that his cold white face
And his eyes? dull, meaningless stare
Have cut'deep in my mem?ry a fiery trace, ?
I got such a deuce of a scare.


? Well,? said Joe at last, ?the poor joker is dead, ?
He?s lost the last trick, and has paid ;
Just you open the swag for the tommy hawk, Ned,
It must do instead of a spade;
For we can?t leave a man like ourselves to rot
On grass, like a dog by thunder !
This appears a softish enough sort of a spot,
Where we can soon put him under.?
So we scooped a hole in the sticks and the dirt,
With such tools we couldn?t do better,
And, lifting him, saw in his old twill shirt
The faded page of a letter.
Says my mate, ? I guess its a mean sort of a game,
And reading this letter I hate,
Still ?tis the only way to find out his name,
That his friends may know of his fate.
So, down we both sat for to spell it out there, ?
When a picture fell from the fold ;
?Twas a woman?s face, that was wondrously fair,
Bound about with a tress of gold
O
Which we read had been sent from another land
As a token to one in this,
And away in the past that a small gentle hand
Had been touched by the dead tramp?s kiss.
For he, so it told, in the years now gone by,
Had left her, to win him a name,
Left home, love, and friends, in the Yarran to die,
Having got the worst of the game.


? P?rhaps,? said Joe, ?she may still be waiting to hear
His step, and her name on his lips ;
I guess it is better to let him lie here
While she watches the home-bound ships.
For at best we can only tell of his end
While sending the likeness and hair;
Her heart would be liker to break than to mend ;
Nor would it be treating him fair.?
So we laid her love in his lone shallow grave,?
Face, letter, and tress on his breast;
And, unsullied by foot of coward or knave,
The hope of her heart lies at rest.
�flit) jigger?s |lam.
? Wii AT, turning in 1 why have another fill man 1 ?
Joe, pitch that bit of box upon the lire,
I?ll trouble you this way to pass the swill-can, ?
Come, spin a yarn while I fill up my briar!?
So, sitting at a camp tire one September,
I asked a digger old and worn and gray
To tell his life?and this, if I remember,
Is something like the style he fired away.
? Well, as you will, but it must be an old one, ?-
I knows no cullers of these crooked days
When first prospectors very seldom ? hold one ?
Well knowin? selling is the game as pays.


?Twas, let me see, say sixteen years or over,
Since I had for a mate a chap named Bill,
While life was hardly what is termed in clover
When we was sinkin? up on Sandy Hill.
Well, boys, one day when it was near on dinner,
I heerd long Bill send up a dismal groan,
Adding, with reckless oaths, ?As I?m a sinner
I?ve struck upon a damned great chunk of stone !?
At first I scarcely did more than half believe him,
For not a sign of stone was there about,
But later on when goin? to relieve him?
There stuck the cussed thing without a doubt.
That we struck work I guess goes without saying,
We didn?t drink, because?we had no ? stuff,?
For Providence had lately started playing
The kerds on us particularly rough ;
?Cause Bendigo was not a place to live in,
For those as came their capital to nurse,
When diggers forty pounds a bag was givin?
For flour as wasn?t worth a tinker?s curse.
You see the drays was stuck up with their loadin?
In scrub where teams could pull until they burst,
Through which there ran I guess the wildest road in
A country noted for about the worst.
While, if you?ll pardon here a slight digression,
I would remark that morals too was lax,
And, meanin? no offence by the expression,
Observe that whites can steal as well as blacks;


For one night, just before I went a broker,
As I was lyin? smokin? in my tent,
A thinkin? out a small idea at poker,
I seen the canvas near me slightly rent,
And, presently a fairish large incision
Allowed a hand and arm to enter in,
Which same was placed with masterly precision
Upon the lid as covered up my ? tin.?
But, it so happened, yieldin? to a notion,
I?d put a tommyhawk aside my bunk,
Which now I raised?a prey to strong emotion,
Intendin? for to ? trump ? the cussed skunk ;
So, just as he had got each thievin? finger
Around the little bag which held my all,
I didn?t give him time or chance to linger,
But, promptly let the trusty tommy fall.
He seemed to be in kinder of a flurry,
Leastways he didn?t wait to take his hand,
While jumpin? up, in somewhat of a hurry,
I found ?my noble? by the diggers manned :
We bound his stump, and then we tied him double,
Intendin? for to lynch him without fail,
When blow me ! arter all our care and trouble
The bobbies came and marched him off to jail,
And, here, if so be that the crowd is willin?,
I?ll tell a yarn of one as I knew there,
Who found a ton of gold,?lost every shillin?,
And starving, kicked the bucket in despair.


He made his pile through bein? lucky reefin?,
And lost his head through fondness for a gal?
That sort of claim will bring a man to grief in
The quickest time on record, eh old pal ?
I happened to be workin? for this joker,
Who liquored in the name of Tom McKoy,
And either as a millionaire or ? broker,?
He was about the warmest kind of boy ;
His reef was just a mile from where we boarded,
And every time we went to have some grub,
A band of coves with instruments was ordered,
To play us to and from the blessed pub.?
The band went first, while Tom hisself came second
Upon a boss whose only saddle gear
A scarlet blanket was, and this he reckoned
Tip top for style,?and we brought up the rear,
Arrivin? at the pub it was his custom
To have the champagne poured into a pail ;
For men could drink enough of his to bust ?em,
When nuggets were a-comin? thick as hail.
There was no reason that I know to hinder
His using doors for goin? in and out,
But, that to go to meals he used the winder,
There cannot be a shadder of a doubt;
While, all the time he fed the band kept braying,
And that there bar was full of oaths and swill,
Till, ?mid a chorus hoarse of roars and playing,
He joined his miners ?cross the winder-sill.


Then off we started in the same procession,
The band a-tooting, Tom upon his moke; ?
Till eighty thousand slipped from his possession,
And hunger killed him close to where he ? broke.?
But Lord I?m endin? where I should be startin?,
So, just to retrogress to that there stone,
It ended with the same and us a partin??-
Clean bested by the hand it ? went alone ??
While we took diggin? on the weekly system?
A thing for oldish miners rather rough ;
But then it was a game you hit or missed em?;
And that same rock scored heavy on the ? bluff'
Well, let me see, I s?pose a month had ended,
When Bill one evenin? came up feelin? sick ;
And as, though dosed with pills, he never mended,
I guessed as how he meant to ? cut his stick.?
And one night as I listened to his chatter
Of home and kerds and scenes across the sea,
{For fever?d made him mad as any hatter ),
He sudden turned and said this ?ere to me:?
? The gold?s below the stone in our old ? duffer,
I?ll go and get the powder while you drill
When, as he pointed, death prodooced his snuffer,
And on his bunk Bill sank quite dead and still.
buried him?and, though they said I?d ?got ?em,?
Went down and drilled a hole in that old chunk,
And raised the same by powder from its bottom?
Which act gained me the name of bein? drunk ;


Still, down I goes, when lyin? in a basin,
(To prove my dyin? mate no lies had told)
As though sealed up by some almighty mason,
I found a solid mass of yellow gold.
|3ack Ccmntrjj Jlate Jftettiug.
So you?re tired of our civilised racing,
And sick of the din of the ring,?
I suppose you?ve been playing at placing,
And got a hit under the wing ?
?Tis surprising how moral it makes us
When a ? pot ? gets lost in the ruck,
Or the rush of an outsider wakes us
To the fact that pockets are struck.
Or, perchance, you?ve been backing a double
(Hot goods at a thousand to five)
To discover to-day for your trouble
That only one ?leg? is alive.
Do you really suppose men are laying
Such odds to give you a show 1 ?
When the fact that you?re generally ? paying
Should answer decidedly?? No /?
There is little in plunging on horses,
Or ?how would the bookmakers live ?
Taking doubles ?of all our strange courses ?
Just means tossing sand in a sieve.
But I know well, old man, you are thinking
That I have as much right to teach
As a toper who cannot help drinking
May have on intemp?rance to preach.


And, as both our cigars are still lighted,
I?ll give moralizing the ? go,?
For small talking great wrongs never righted,
And rubbing a raw spot is low.
So I?ll give you, as well as I?m able,
The yarn of a meeting ? out back,?
Where I rode for Pat Cox?s stable, .
And was done by Hawkins? old hack.
It was held at a pub near the station?
A place where a man brought his cheque,
And promoted his liver?s damnation
By aid of his mouth and his neck.
?Still I must say this much for old Polly
As soon as she?d got all his stuff,
She well lectured the man on his folly,
In language as pointed as rough.
If the crowd was more mixed than extensive,
Still its clothes had unstudied ease?
Much less pandering to the expensive,
Than savouring of ? go as you please.?
While the men who had just finished shearing
Had all come possessing a thirst
To old Polly both grateful and cheering,
As betokening a lengthen?d ? burst.?
The race-track had been cut through the Yarran,
And each post was a pine-stick pole,
?Grown in scrub-land as hard and as barren
As_ an average rich man?s soul;
While the judge had to issue his fiat
Prom the door in front of the bar,


?Mid the oaths and the wrestling and riot
Of the sons of sheepshears and tar.
They began with a three-quarters scurry
For a saddle of wondrous build,
And they made up for science by hurry,
For with them ?twas the pace that killed ;
Then an hour was devoted to blowing
And drinking and handling the ? kip,?
For at ? heading ? these shearers were knowing,.
And at talk creation could whip.
But at last firmly fixed was each hurdle
Of saplings that gave when you struck, ?
To spring back in a way apt to curdle
The blood of the men in the ruck.
We had just about finished our canter
On mounts that were grass-fed and plain,,
Amid volleys of back-country banter,
When?down in a sheet came the rain.
And away like a shot went old Carter,
While his voice from a shelter came,
In thick tones which remarked, that, as starter,,
He must ? pass ? on this sort of game.
So we sat till the nigger grew whiter,
And water was deep in our boots,
While our breeches grew colder and tighter
Than swelliest summer-cut suits.
But at length when we?d almost decided
To scatter?the storm ?gan to fag,
And old Carter, whose dryness derided
Our dampness?stept out with the flag..


Freddy O?Cock was riding a bay one?
As a fencer far from a ?dab,?
While the black boy was up on a grey one,
As thin and as tall as a slab ;
Tommy Cox had the mount on the Colonel?
A horse somewhat aged and calm,
And full strange as it tells, an infernal
Mail driver was up on Alarm ;
Poor old Stockwell, the horse I was steering,
Was given his fences to brush?
An accomplishment not over cheering,
In face of the mud and the slush.
For a mile we were all in a cluster,
Till Colonel slipped under the rails?
Treating Tom to a deuce of a buster; ?
Then the man who carried the mails
Took Alarm to the front?-or was taken,
I never could rightly tell which,
For my notions of things had got shaken
When my mount slipped into the ditch.
Freddy O?Cock was first to go at him,
Though the bay struck fence after fence,
But the way that old amateur sat him
Was, speaking with mildness, immense.
Thus we raced till we came to the running,
Where backeis indignantly asked
If I thought I was out for a sunning?
For Stockwell was lying long last.
At the hurdle which stood at the turning
The bay made the upper pole snap,


And, the rule about horse-lining spurning,
I sent my old chap through the gap,?
For ?Adventurer? quickly was tiring,
And Alarm was racing at ease,
While the black boy was hot and perspiring
With holding The Slab off his knees.
As I raced by the nigger he shouted,
? Baal gammon, that fellow for pace !?
When the moment we rose the bay clouted,
And left me the postman to chase.
In the run home I thought I had caught him,
For I saw him draw out his whip,
But in spite of himself?the horse brought him
Clean through?and I lost by a pip.
It was bad to be beaten, and spattered
With mud till one looked like a black ;
Still, at worst, neither much to me mattered,
It was this that took me aback ;
W hen a brawny and hard handed loser?
A man who could fight for an hour,
Shouted out to a tall brother booser,
? That chap rode like a bag of flour!?
1 was then but a boy, Jack, old fellow,
Easily hurt by what they said.?
But it strikes me we?re both growing mellow,
So old comrade let?s get to bed !

VARIOUS RHYMES.
Jfttanhtrings in an JUtMral JVrrahu.
Dreamland ! ere the rude awaking,
When our hopes were all of Spring,
And each rosy morning, breaking,
Bore new joys upon its wing;
When the waters through the willows
Shimmered bright as silver shields,
And the grass made scented pillows
In the flower-enamelled fields.
Spots made them dear by idle resting,
When the world was all at play,
Till the waves, our dream-banks cresting,
Burst, and swept them all away ;
Pools of crystal deeply shaded
By the leaves of fern and vine,
Where in summer days we waded,
Ere the lees had soured the wine.
Meetings by the star-lamps lighted ;
, Whispering under gnarled oaks ;
?Strolls in gardens blossom-whited, ?
Gardens dear to evening smokes,


When nicotian visions floated
On the dewy wings of night,
And we hardly knew or noted
Fleeting time?s too rapid flight.
Mimic plays whose memories waken
Thoughts of loved days left behind, ?
Plays where every role was taken
By the fair, the bright, the kind ;
Where the pain was only spoken
From the lips, and not the heart,
Where our vows were only broken
In the acting of a part.
Nights when winter winds were hurling
All their might on mountain trees,
And the leaves were madly whirling
O?er the face of rain-swept leas ;
When we watched the firelight gleaming
On the bowl of glass and pipe ;
Nights of brightly-gilded dreaming,
Born of vintage warm and ripe.
Hope?s own temple ! dear old study !
Where we built any airy shrine,
Lighted by the embers ruddy,
Sacred to the fabled nine,
Echoing to the feet of others
Who had placed their offerings there.
Hallowed by the thoughts of brothers
Who had passed the gates of care.


MEANDERINGS IN AN AUSTRAL ARCADY. 6$
Rides and drives through town and village,
Over hill and swampland low.
Through wild vales unknown to tillage
Where the fern trees tallest grow ?
Out to where the crags and mountains
Stretch beyond the dimmest blue,
And the spray of forest fountains
Lies upon the leaves as dew.
Where the river onward rushing
Springs to misty depths below,
Coloured, as a maiden blushing
?Neath the ardent noontide glow,
Flashing rays of varied splendour,?
As of golden locks undone,?
Born of kisses warm and tender,
Kisses of the kingly sun.
Kisses that again will woo her
Down among the deeper groves,
When the birds are singing to her
All the story of their loves ;
Down amid those wondrous wild lands
Folding homes of shade and rest,
Far remote from upper high lands
Where the eagle builds her nest.
Where the rocks are almost hidden
- By their robes of gold and green,
And the music comes unbidden
From the flashing, flying stream ;


Where the trails are shaded wand?rings
By the virgin cedar boles, ?
Pathways sweet to pensive pond?rings,
Pathways dear to weary souls.
Where a subtle scent is waking
From the spray-besprinkled vines,
And the lights are softly breaking
Through the canopy of pines,
Where the upper world, forgotten,
May not dart a jarring sound
Through the stately limbs begotten
Of the water-nurtured ground.
Oh ! my comrades ! we may never
Meet among such scenes again,?
Realms unknown to mad endeavour,
Lands unknown to want and pain.
Lo ! the waters we remember,?
Kissed by sun, and wooed by shades,
Watched by us one dead December,
Long have left those peaceful glades.
For of parting they were singing
Notes we deemed were wildly sweet,
While the trailing boughs were clinging
Fondly to their passing feet,?
Feet, alas ! that might not linger
Midst the haunts of fern and flower,
For old Time, with stony finger,
Coldly marked the passing hour.


So through shadows deep they wended,
Kissed the base of rock and tree,
Swift the lowest fall descended,
On their journey to the sea,
Bearing scent of fond embraces
Caught from flowers that flourish there,
Caught?to waft to barren places,
Caught?to lose in other air.
Like the river, we may only
Pass the spots where we would dwell,
Like the river, life is lonely,
And we meet?to say farewell.
Since we strayed amid this dreamland,
Sipping youths ambrosial wine,
We have passed through many a meanland
Bordering on the road of time.
Some have left our life forever,
Gone to join the silent dead ;
Some from us wide oceans sever ?
Some are lost, and some are wed.
Dreamland from our life is banished ;
Swept aside its well loved forms;
For the joyous past has vanished
In the rack of later storms.

He comes out from the deeper shades
To where, amid the golden light
That kisses soft the wattle glades,
She stands in robes of white
Alone among the sunlit meads,
A nymph so young, so pure, so fair,
That every ray its brightness feeds
Upon her standing there.
Within her fingers lightly pressed,
Gazed on with tender loving eyes,
A rose?Ah ! flower, indeed, how blessed !
Watched by her ere it dies.
?She dreams of one, yet does not deem
(His nearing tread so light and fleet,)
That o?er his cloak the self-same beam
Has swept which bathes her feet.
But now his arm is round her cast,
His raven hair has touched her own ;
*
Her lover has come back at last,
She is no more alone.
Around the stem her fingers press ;
He pleads to stay with her for aye
The red sweet lips low murmur ? yes ?*
As dies the summer day.


ifepatis.
She pants along the marble nave
Like wounded doe by hounds hard pressed,
Or tired swimmer when some wave
Has struck his breast.
And as she flies, the fragments torn
From off her shoulders strew the way ;
Till all the fairness of her form
Lies bare to day.
On, on, she speeds, to where, above
The chancel, hangs a holy face ;
And there?beneath the God of Love?
She halts a space ;
And, shaking off? their impious hands
With all the strength of last despair,
Now, naked, beautiful, she stands,
And fronts them there.
One foot before the altar placed,
The other on the marble floor ;
No nobler image e?er was traced
By art of yore.
Around her hips the silken hair
Hangs like a sun-dyed, wind-tost cloud,
And mantles all her bosom bare
As with a shroud.


One hand the golden tresses fold
About her lithe, warm-tinted limbs,
Yet scarce the yellow of the gold
Their brightness dims.
The other faultless, snow-white arm,
In last appeal, she throws on high
To where the Christ, in grand, still calm.
May hear her cry.
And who shall say she looks in vain 1
This woman standing all alone :
For such as she the Christ was slain?
They are His own.

How often in the eventide,
When sitting by the fire,
The forms of dear ones who have died
Rise from the glowing pyre ;
And faces of an earlier day
Look up amid the flame,
As those, who now have gone for aye,.
Appear to us again.
We seem to have reunion, then,
With younger hopes and fears,
With women true, and trusted men,
Our friends of dear dead years
While all the past again is bright,
And robed in rich attire ;
Thus watching on a winter?s night
Old faces in the fire.


'll he (Spirits uf the
Sitting lonely in the silence, come the phantoms of the
past,
And across my heated fancy are their shadows swiftly
cast,
Till the ghosts of buried mem?ries in the chamber
silent tread,
And I seem to hold communion with the spirits of
the dead.
While around me in the ether that through ages floats
in space
The soft flutter of their pinions seems to cool my tired
face,
And the odour of their presence as a subtle incense
strong
Steals before my jaded senses like a strain of mellow
song;
And I feel sweet spirit fingers lightly press upon my
hair,
Till the weary brain, responsive, gladly casts away all
care,
E?en as though their unseen watching bore with it a
healing balm,
As of old a voice on Galilee gave deep and sudden
calm.
Stay awhile, ah, best-loved spirit ! Let me feel thou
standest by !
Let me feast my eyes a moment where my thoughts
forever lie !
And though thou art but a vision, born of dreaming
long and deep,
But a mirage of the senses, but a picture dawn by
Sleep,


Yet, oli slumber, lock thy chambers, that no other
enter in !
Let me welcome back my loved one?pure from earth
and earthly sin !
Let me meet my long lost idol freed for aye from
death and pain !
Let me see she but remembers !?then I have not
dreamed in vain.
Nearing now till I can almost feel her breath upon
my cheek,
Though the face seems brighter, fairer, comes the
vision that I seek,
And I gladly spring to clasp it?this my love of days
now old,
But, alas, as cold as marble is the form my arms
enfold ;
While a voice, which seems to echo somewhat of a
distant day,
Gently whispers, ? I may never give you back a love
of clay
That amid the dust lies buried with the one you loved
so well, ?
Never more to hold dominion where a purer theme
may dwell.
Oh, cast thou aside the idols which beset an earthly
life !
So that when the fight is over ?and thou leav?st the
weary strife,
I may meet thee at the portals of the realms of
endless day ;
Then thy hopes will all be garnered?and our love
will be for aye.?

'Two cherubs lie in happy sleep
Within the hollow of a tree.
Above, the May leaves lazy sweep ;
Low hums the bee.
A couch of snowy feathers theirs,
In silvan shadows sweetly set ;
No weary days engraved with cares
Have come as yet.
Above, fond watching o?er their nest,
One elbow leaning on the wood,
Is one, whom they have lately blessed
With motherhood.
Around her form white roses twine?
Not whiter than each snowy breast;
While every fiow?ret seems to pine
On her to rest.
With hands light clasped above her head,
She gazes on them sleeping there;
And all her life is fully fed
With visions fair.
They are in truth her dearer life ;
Save them no other joy she craves, ?
But asks to shield from care and strife
Her sleeping babes.

?Tis years ago, and memories have grown dim,
For fled the lights that lit them to the mind
Alas ! I?ve heard each soul?s expiring hymn,
All gone before, while I am left behind.
Yet, from the wreck of many fancies flown,
One tender flow?ret of the past I keep, ?
One picture that I cherish for my own, ? ,
A memory near me when I wake or sleep.
Yes, still it comes to me, through years now gray
With age, and early hope for ever gone ;
And, floating down Time?s dark and sullen way,.
It strikes my senses like a low sweet song.
I see a crowd of faces all intent
To seize amusement from the mimic play ;
I see her face alight with merriment,
As through the wings she trips?a joyous fay.
I hear applauding cries that loudly ring,
And listen to her as the full notes swell;
I see the floral gifts the people fling,
Then wait to hear her ask?? Was that done well 7


The road to fame was reached, yet never more
Saw I her winning eyes or fairy form ;
Fate, merciless, our too short friendship tore?
Gave her the calm, gave me the drifting storm
I since have heard her later life has brought
A harvest rich of histrionic art;
And wonder does she ever give a thought
To one who helped her in her earliest ? part.?

Mourx, O sea, that he is dead !
Clouds your tears above him shed !
Wandering wild-bird sing his story
To Australian forests hoary !
Scenes to which his muse was wed.
Moon that is forever bright
Bathe his grave with softest light !
Sound his psean torrent rushing
Down where depths your voice is hushing
Mid a gloom of starless night!
Land whose woods he sang of best
Guard him in your virgin breast!
For, remember, in your keeping,
Nature?s poet now is sleeping?
Taking his eternal rest!

Along the bridge the people pass;
The river, like dark gloomy Styx,.
A stream in which each sex and class
Who cross must mix.
Sin brushes with her tainted skirt
The snowy robe that virtue wears
Both gilded wealth and squalid dirt
The roadway bears.
And there beside a pillar sits
A woman wan, with hungry eyes
Across whose brow the moonlight flits,
And, pitying, flies.
With one poor pallid wasted arm,
Her bosom warm its loving nest,
She guards her infant child from harm
o
Against her breast.
About her feet the roses lie
That she has offered all day long ;
The plaintive cry, ? Sweet flowers do buy !?'
Her sad, sad song.
But few alas have time to think,
And fewer still who think will care
To d raw this poor waif from the brink
Of black despair.


The sullen stream still onward flows ;
But neither wealth nor virtue deign
To help this woman no one knows,
And ease her pain.
Too late, alas ! no pitying hand
From that great crowd is stretched to save ;
She seeks at last some kinder land
Beneath the wave.

Fair is thy form where love half-sleeping lies,
Tender thy voice as the last note that dies
On summer air, when breezes soft and low
Through forest harps on moonlit evenings blow.
Scented and soft thy wondrous falls of hair,
Something to love each bright tress coiling there, ?
Great golden cords to bind me to thy feet?
Bright gilded bars through which to woo thee, sweet.
Tenderly dreamful thy lash-shrouded eyes,
Gentle as moonlight, clear as cloudless skies?
Turning my life as the dower to the sun?
Drawing my heart to thee, beautiful one.
Soft a's the dewy moss- ?crimson thy lips,
As some new-wakened rose where the bee sips,
Bright one, I long to taste e?en as the bee,
So, like thy sister rose, yield love to me'!

At times when sleep has almost won its way,
As thick its heavy chains around me twine,
I hear a chord of some far-distant day
Sound like the striking of a mellow chime.
Yet whence it comes I never quite can tell,
Although well-loved the song whose tender notes
Arrest awhile deep slumber?s heavy spell,
Ere far away upon the night it floats.
Now ?tis a croning rhyme of years agone,?
Murmured above the cot wherein I lay,?
The simple refrain of a child?s sleep song,
Whispered by faithful lips long passed away.
And now a voice far fonder, far more sweet,
Storing my youthful life with holy themes,
Striving with earnest hope to guide my feet
Along the pathway of a mother?s dreams.
It floats away, and gentle as the sigh
Breathed from Eolian harps when winds are low,
Come notes of love which bid my memory fly
To vanished hopes and vows of long ago.
Then all are still, ?and then is one sweet swell
Of tender song they linger o?er my bed,
While, soothed to slumber by their gentle spell,
I sleep?watched over by the dear-loved dead.

I saw thee first, my peerless one,
?Neath soft Australian skies ;
What time the rays of summer sun
On far blue summits dies.
The light shone on your golden hair ;
You stood the pines among;
While everv bird that warbled there

But echoed back thy song.
I see thee yet, my dear lost one,
Though soft Australian skies
And tender beams of summer sun
No more will greet thine eyes.
?Tis but a fancy nothing more?
You sleep the pines among?
Yet, like a voice from Heaven?s shore,
I hear thy low sweet song.


olh Jockey anh his Jftcnmt:
battle.
So you?ve come for a pat and a rub, old man,
And I daresay for something sweet 1
Well, then, poke your nose in my coat, if you can,
But hang it?look out for my feet!
You have hundreds of burrs in your mane, I see,
And the gloss has gone from your skin ;
There is but one difference ?twixt you and me?
I grow fat, while you?re getting thin.
We are only a pair of old duffers now, ?
Hardly worth the food we may eat,
You have scarcely pace enough left for a plough,
I?strength for a cabman?s seat.
Still to-day we may both call to mind, old man,
When your coat gleamed bright in the sun,
As from start to finish you jumped in the van, ?
The day our last Steeple was won.
Not a rap do they care for us now, my boy,
For we are both placed on the shelf,
Little use to remember the worn-out toy
That no more may win them their pelf.


Yet what heroes they made of us each, that day,
How they raved of my hands and head ;
When, between you and me, we got right away
From a field that was ? poor or dead.?
Ah, if something had come with a rush at the end?
For a run from the furlong post,
?T would with both I fear have been ? bellows to mend,?"
In the stead of ? eggs upon toast.?
You remember they said that Fred was a fool
Or a cur to ride such a race;
We know had he not been both plucky and cool
He could not have run in a place.
But the backers all swore he threw up his chance.
By letting me off with the lead,
Had he come at us then, we know what a dance
He?d have had on his half-trained weed.
Recall, too, the day when the favourite struck,
And Tommy was pitched on his head.
We heard the rail rattle way back in the ruck,
But the public, who did not, said
He got a cool hundred to slip off his horse,
That his mount never hit at all,
That it paid him a great deal better of course
A hatful to win by a fall.


No matter to them that he?d ridden for years,
And had won them race after race, ?
For his victories they gave him?hut empty cheers,
For defeat?a slap in the face.
I can picture them now as they rush about?-
A terror to trainer and jock,
Half wild with excitement, attempting to ? tout ?
For those tips which the ? Ring ? must knock.
Which gained, then they vanish?of layers in chase, ?
A fiver to plunge on a prad,
And should he be beaten by riding or pace,
They swear by the gods they?ve been ? had.??
For nothing that carries their money must fail,
Or failing is ?pulled ? in their eyes,
.Since though they may not know his head from his tail,
At least they are well up in lies.
We have heard how the locks are all bought by the
And many more wonderful tales; [? Ring,?
But those, who this doctrine persistently sing,
Should remember horsemen like Hales ;
Yes, and most of the rest, for you know, old horse,
When you only went for a ? run,?
?Twas not in the Paddock, nor yet on the Course,
But at home the ? stopping ? was done.


For riders can talk, and few men are such fools
As to trust a fallible hand,
Or to cut themselves playing with sharp-edged tools,
When safer are at their command.
All trainers are terrible rogues at the best,
So at least say backers who pay;
Still I wonder, supposing owners confessed,
If the public the same would say.
You have heard queerish things in your box, old chap,.
When your owner explained a plan,
By the working of which he hoped ? to go nap
Well?he did not next time you ran.
The public would never be guilty, not they !
Of trying to buy those who ride,
Yet I think you may still bear in mind the day
When a backer stood at your side,
And laid me a hundred to nothing about
A horse we just managed to beat;
?Twas purely from friendship, he said. Yo doubt 1
As a hint to me it seemed neat.
We know-how the innocents bluster and rave,
Should a favourite chance to go wrong;
How they call the owner a rogue and a knave,
And harp on the worn-out old song,


That a man should run for the fun of the tiling,
Yes, and ruin a horse for aye,
Forsooth, that a harvest of coin he may bring
To men with no trainers to pay.
Of course, we are hardly the fools to suppose
That ? scratching ? is always quite fair,
Or, in fact, that in every starter who ? goes ?
Backers get a run ? on the square.?
Still, we also know, if the Turf must be swept
Of dirt?all the brooms should be clean ;
And racing will never grow moral except
The public much alter, I ween.
That the Racecourse is not what they?d like to see?
Is a fact all sportsmen deplore,
But I fear the end of the ? stiff ?uns ? will be
The end of the world?not before.
But why should we talk of the days that are past;
Of the races we won or lost;
Both our dice from the box are forever cast,
And aside we have both been tossed.
?Tis time that we went, for Lone Hand is away,
By backers and fielders unknown;
How they petted and cheered him that glorious day,
When he carried the top weight ? home !?


threat Sussex no more may Tom Corrigan bear
To the front in spite of his load,
The strongest and swiftest to do and to dare
That ever man handled or rode.
Old Student now sleeps on the field where he fell, ?
Running game and true in the van;
While brave Kangaroo takes an unending spell
Not far from the brown beaten ? Tan.?
Never more may McLeod recover his seat
Amid shouts of wonder and fear;
While loud must, alas ! be the thunder of feet
That the gallant Jack Cray can hear.
All the friends of our youth have finished the ? course.
While a sterner than Ashworth waits,
Till again on your back I will ride, old horse,
Through the endless paddock gates.
