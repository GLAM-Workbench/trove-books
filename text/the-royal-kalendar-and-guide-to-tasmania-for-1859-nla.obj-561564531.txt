PREFACE.
The Royal Kalendab and Guide to Tasmania fob
1859 is submitted to the public.
The utmost care has been taken to compile a correct Guide r
the Official Directory having been revised in the office of
the Colonial Secretary ; the Legal Directory, in the Registry
of the Supreme Court; the Clergy, by the Bishops’ Secre-
taries ; the Postal Regulations, by the. Secretary to the Post
Office ; the Freemasons, by the Provincial Grand Master ;
the Odd Fellows, by the Grand Secretary ; the Land Depart-
ment, in the Survey Office; and all the information connected
with Launceston having passed through the hands of the
highest authorities of that Town.
With these remarks as to the care which has been taken,
I trust the little Book will receive, in this, its Second Year,
the support of the public.
H. M. H.

FEBRUARY.—Transplant in an open compartment a general crop of celery, in
trenches; plant some young cabbages, plants pretty thick, to come in for coleworts ;
sow also some cabbage seeds in beds, which must be watered in dry weather. Con-
tinue to sow and transplant lettuce and endive ; keep beds of young and old asparagus
clear from weeds with the hand. Sow onions for winter and spring use, and examine
the beds of keeping and bulbous onions, pull them as soon as the tops are decayed.
Gather seeds of all kinds as soon as ripe, as if left too long the seed will fall out of
the pods. Look to wall trees, cut out useless shoots, and nail the others straight to
the wall. Keep all fruit-tree borders clear from weeds. Continue budding, and after
the bud is inserted tie a cabbage leaf over it to protect it from the rays of the sun.
Flower Garden— Sow polyanthus and auricula seed, and transplant perennial and
Mgn»ial/}»l<mts in showery weather; mow grass walks and lawns, to keep up a neat
appearanrid.

fully preparing the soil beforehand. Those possessing greenhouses should now replace
plants which had been put in the open air in spring.

Tie up endive and lettuce ; clean the beds of winter and spring onions. Make hot-
beds and commence forcing early asparagus, sow a small crop of carrots for early use ;
dress the beds of rhubarb, artichokes, and asparagus—to the latter apply salt, if
attainable; cover up the seakale to blanch. This is the best time to plant out fruit,
trees ; sow at this time seeds and nuts of plum, cherry, almond, medlar, apple, pear,
quince, walnut, &c.-—these are, in Tasmania, usually sown much too late in the spring.
Flower Gardes —Strike geraniums, China roses, &c. from cuttings ; part herbace-

JUNE.—In dry weather earth up celery, artichokes, cardoons, &c.; sow peas and
beans for a second crop ; attend to the mushroom beds, keep them dry by a thick
covering of clean straw; trench up all vacant spots of ground and prune standard
fruit-trees of all kinds, also espaliers or wall trees, and nail or tie up the latter straight
to the wall or stakes at proper distances; prune gooseberry and currant trees, and
plant the cuttings. Stake and put malch or wet dung to the roots of newly planted
trees, prune and cut hedges, plant out trees only in mild weather. Wash your apple
trees with a strong solution of soap and soda to remove the blight; it may be effectu-
ally extirpated by anointing the affected trees with spirits of tar, or raking off the
ragged or dry bark and then scrubbing the trunk and branches with a hard brush and
lime-water. Flower Garden —Put narcissus and hyacinths in bulb glasses; take
all plants out of flower-pots that have been in more than twelve months, and put them
in fresh ones, with fresh soil.

week, plant celery into trenches ; water every morning, before sunrise, in dry weather
all beds and newly planted articles —prune and train the summer shoots of fruit-trees.
Flower Garden —Pay strict attention to the flowers that were sown in patches in
the borders, and where they are too thick, thin them about four or five ; cut out all
straggling shoots and keep the borders regularly hoed and raked. During this and
the preceding month allow no weeds to seed, and plants destroyed now will he the
means of saving much labour next month.






TASMANIA.
On the 19th February, 1859, fifty-five years will have rolled
along the stream of Time since Tasmania was colonised by the
British people : for on that day, in the year of Grace 1804, was
discharged from H.M.S. Ocean, a freight of England’s erring
exiles, with their guard of Royal Marines, to populate the new
Colony.
From a Series of Statistical Tables, prepared by Hugh M. Hull,
extending from 1804 to 1823, and which were published by the
House of Parliament, many interesting details of the early history
of the Colony may be gathered : among which may be mentioned,
—the first muster roll, of the people, taken in 1819, by “ Commissary
Hull” Garrison Orders, preventing free settlers from leaving
their houses after dark ; —the couvre feu order to put out lights at
9 p.m. ; —the stationing of armed sentinels in the fields to protect
the wheat, which was then selling at £4 per bushel; —the mys-
terious destruction of all the Government records of 1809; —and
accounts of bushranging and murder to a fearful extent.
Following down the history of Tasmania through series after
series of Statistical Tables, —some prepared by the late Captain
Montagu, others by the Rev. Thomas Ewing, and others, again,
for many years, by Mr. H. M. Hull, —it is brought to December
1846, the culminant point of the Colony in its convict character :
when, in fact, the male convict population of 32,000 men almost
doubled the free ; and nearly 5000 female prisoners spread sin and
demoralisation throughout the land.
Now, a happier state of things exists. “ Where grew a briar, now
flourishes the myrtle.” The crumbling lichen-encrusted ruins of
the old convict stations, with some few hundred prisoners under
coercion at Port Arthur, alone remain to show that Tasmania was
once the “ dust-hole,” not only of Britain, but of the sister Colonies
of Australasia.
The Aboriginal Black Population, which, it is said, once
numbered 5000, now consists of five old men and nine old women.
No children are born to them. Uncleanly, unsober, unvirtuous,
unenergetic, and irreligious, with a past character for treachery,
and no record of one noble action, the race is fast fading away, and
its utter extinction will hardly be regretted.
It is a pleasing fact, that of the population, which at the present
day amounts to upwards of 83,000 souls, 16,500 are Tasmanian
€


born men and boys, and 16,600 Tasmanian born women and girls.
The handsome, spirited, and active young settlers, the beauty of
their sisters, and the very healthy appearance of the little children,
have formed the published themes of admiration of many visitors
from other |ands ; and the children of the present, or third, genera-
tion bid fair to outrival, their parents. In 1849, Mr. H. M. Hull
compiled, from actual weighing and measurement, a table showing
the relative height and weight of nearly a thousand children ; and
the. Tasmanians bore away the 'palm in each case.
Tasmania —truly called the “ Granary of the Australias”—
the “ Garden of the South,”— the “ Sanatarium of India,” —
with a. climate whose summer equals that of London, —whose
winter is not more severe than that of the south of France, —whose
autumn possesses two months more growing weather than England,
—with an equal fall of rain throughout the year, —a freedom from
malaria, —a bright and clear atmosphere,—and the English aspect
of its towns and villages and cultivation, —offers great advantages
to persons seeking health after a residence in warm climates, and
to families wishing to avoid the burning heat, danger, and discom-
fort of. the summer of the neighbouring gold-producing country of
Victoria, from. which it is distant only twenty-four hours steaming.
The productions of Tasmania are gold, black lead, iron, galena,
coal, alum, asbestos, and other minerals; amethysts, topazes,
beryls, opal, jasper, and other precious stones ; gums, valuable in
medicine; and grain of every description (even the cereals of
India), and of superior quality. In its luxuriant climate the
timber-trees are gigantic; shrubs grow into forest-trees; and
flowers, rare and beautiful enough to command elsewhere watchful
care and attention, grow in every valley, unattended, but not
unadmired.
To develop the varied resources of Tasmania, the Royal Society
has been established, under the patronage of Her Most Gracious
Majesty, and with His Excellency Sir Henry Young as President,
including among its 300 members men of all classes, who have in
view the interests of their adopted home. The Museum of the
Soeiety is one of the most valuable public institutions in the
Colony., and particularly attractive to strangers.
The information contained in the following pages will show that
the Colony possesses advantages superior to the other Australasian
Colonies in almost every respect. Under Responsible Government
its resources are being rapidly brought forward Railways are in
immediate contemplation;—lrrigation and Agricultural Societies
are pointing the way to a better and more farmer-like mode of
cultivating the fertile soil; and energetic pioneers are leading their
flocks and herds over the millions of acres of plains and valleys in
what has been, up to this time, called the “ Unsettled Districts.”
—All these point to a bright future for Tasmania.

The office of Coroner is of very ancient date, Coroners being mentioned in the time
of King Alfred. They are principal conservators of the Queen’s peace, and are
Magistrates. Anciently, no one under the rank of Knight could hold the office, and
no fees were demanded for inquests. The fee of Two Guineas, and mileage at the
rate of Twenty Pence per mile, beyond ten miles from the Coroner’s residence, are
now allowed. By an Act of the Colonial Parliament, 22 Viet., Coroners may hold
inquests on fires in Tasmania. All accounts for inquests must he sent to the
Colonial Secretary’s office.
Every Coroner should furnish himself with Jervis on the Office of Coroner, Bvo,

packets be transmitted through the Post Offices of the respective Countries or

appropriate Postage Stamps.
Sealing Wax not to be used.
Letters or Packets which are intended for the East or West Indies, and other warm
climates, or which in their transit must necessarily pass through warm climates,
should not be sealed with wax, unless it has been prepared for the purpose. Consi-
derable delay is frequently occasioned in the case of mails received from England in
consequence of the melting of the wax and adhesion of the letters to each other ;
and, notwithstanding the greatest care is taken in separating the letters, many are
much damaged and torn : the public are therefore recommended, in all cases, to use
wafers in preference to wax in securing their letters and packets, and to advise
their correspondents in England, India, &c., to pursue the same course.
The Names of the Post Office, or Mail Receiving House, to be invariably inserted
in the Address of Letters, fyc.
The public are recommended to date their Letters from the Post Town, or Mail
Receiving Stations, at which they desire to receive their letters and packets, and to
advise their correspondents to insert the same in the direction of their correspondence,
in order to ensure, as far as practicable, accuracy and despatch in their transmission
and delivery.
Letter Receiving Houses at Hobart Town.
The Receiving Houses are visited at 10 o'clock a.m., and 1 and 4 p.m., when all

IRRIGATION.
In the address delivered by His Excellency, Sir Henry Young,
C. 8., as Patron of the Northern Agricultural Society, he brought
prominently under the notice of the members the very high
economic importance of Irrigation ; seeing that its general adop-
tion would considerably enhance the productiveness of grass lands,
and land cultivated with grain crops. Sir Henry mentioned twelve
lakes in the centre of the Island, at heights varying from 1800 to
4000 feet above the level of the sea, the waters of which flow
noi tliwards and southwards, at a gentle descent, through extensive


l'^nin ° f level - count >T- These lakes are as follow :-Lake Arthur

00,000, Lake St. Clair, 10,000 acres, and very deep; Lake Echo,sooo
acres; and six others of smaller dimensions, from 200 to 3000 acres-
together they cover more than 100,000 acres. These, and the river-
shed of upwards of 1 Guides, point out the very great facilities
which exist in lasmama for Irrigation. His Excellency drew
160,000 acres, all capable of being placed under Irrigation : and in
proof of the value of Irrigation to grass lands, he cited U acres of

Sai veyor-General, James Sprent, Esq., who, at a special meeting of
!nLi Sm t ai f ia !\w y ? Society, summoned for the discussion of this
subject, stated that from his accurate knowledge of the countrv he
was able to speak with authority , and he unhesitatingly gave it as
his opinion based upon extended experience—that there was no
country m the world more happily situated as regarded water
which could be used cheaply and advantageously for Irrigation
purposes. At the same meeting was read a Report by the
Police Magistrate of the County of Cumberland, (one of
extensive and flourishing Districts in the Island,)—Mr. Hugh M
Hull —who had personally examined the water supply of that
county : and his Report favourably mentioned the results of Irriga-

in Victoria and the other Australian Colonies, who suffer
horn the depression of the parched summer atmosphere, and its
accompaniments of dust and mosquitos, or whose children require
a change to a cooler climate to brace them against the exhaustion
of a weakened nervous system, should take them on a tour to the
mountain air of Hobart 1 own. This City comprises the unequalled
attractions of the most varied and charming scenery, healthful
climate, and sea-side enjoyment.
The screw steamer City of Hobart, 600 tons, makes the trip from
Melbourne about twice in each month, generally occupying from
48 to 60 hours. Should the voyagers prefer to come via Launceston
20 e W? erS F re ° f T 3o ° tOnS Pach ’ a T ? d make the run in about 18 5
l ro ™ Launceston to Hobart Town two Coaches run
daily, the fares for the 120 miles being 30s. and 4 55.


The scenery around the City is most varied. Mount Wellington
towers over the N. W. end, and so close is its summit (4340 feet
high), that the Church-going Band of the Regiment can be heard
there on a clear Sunday. The rides and drives of the Queen s
Park afford commanding views. In the Park are the Royal Society s
Gardens, of 17 acres, with hot-houses, green-houses, shady bowers,
fruits of all sorts, and flowers from every part of the world; while
the gardens slope down to the calm waters of the River Ileiwent,
which affords ample amusement to those fond of deep-water fishing,
or of rowing or sailing in pleasure boats. Pic-nic parties on the
green banks of the river, or on the beach at Ivangaroo 1 omt, 01 by
climbing to Salvator Rosa Glen or I*ern-tree \ alley, about two
miles from town, or even further up the mountain, on a good bridle-
road, to the Ice House, and by strong active young ladies, even a
climb to the top of Mount Wellington, are frequently resorted to m
the summer and autumn ; while for the sterner sex there are more
extensive walks and rides, all possessing interest, suc h as the
Wellington Falls, the Cliffs of the Quoin, Lady Franklin s Museum,
&c» &c.
Steamers ply between Hobart Town and Kangaroo Point, with
its delightful beaches : the distance is about 3 miles ; the fares, dd.
New Town and Risdon Road, with their gardens and drives, are
well worth notice. „
The Baths, about ten minutes walk from the City, afford means
of enjoying the luxury of secluded Sea Bathing, flhe annual sub-
scription is moderate ; for a single bath the charge is 6d.
Sandy Bay beaches, covered with beautiful Algse and small shells,
afford a promenade for those able to walk or drive two or three
miles; while at Brown’s River, or by steamer to New Norfolk,
every luxury of the country —fruits, flowers, fishing, shooting, &c.,
—can be obtained. . .
In the City itself, the Museum of the Royal Society, in rlarrmg-
street, the Mechanics' Institute, with the Lectures of the season,
the Theatre, the occasional Assembly Balls in the Town Hall, the
Concerts, and the Public Libraries, afford ample occupation and
amusement.
Cricket Clubs are numerous and well attended ; Archery meetings
are held ; and Riding Parties are frequently made up on a minute s
notice to the many beautiful spots about the environs.
Of the Hotels, a few of the most convenient may be mentioned,
where the attendance and Table D’Hote are of excellent character,
such as the Ship, the Freemasons, the Derwent, and De
Roock's HotcXs
Private Boarding Houses, such as Broadland House and Devon-
shire House, afford ample accommodation for families at veiy
economical rates ; while furnished and unfurnished lodgings aie
available in all parts of the City. _ 7
The City is peculiarly favoured in its Public and Private Schools,
in its Religious and Benevolent Societies, and in the orderly arrange-
ments and conduct of its inhabitants, and their thriving Municipal
and other institutions.


A SHORT SKETCH OF LAUNCESTON FOR VISITORS.
Launceston, or Port Dalrymple, as it was anciently called, the
second town of importance in the colony, stands at the confluence
of the North and South Esk rivers ; which here, at the distance of
forty miles from the sea, mingle their waters and form the Tamar.
The town is thus situated nearly centrally in the great valley, which,
extending from the mouth of the Tamar to the centre of the’lsland’,
is bounded on its eastern side by the Ben Lomond range, and by
the western mountains on the other. The town itself is almost en-
closed on its eastern and western sides by the two lesser elevations
known as the Windmill and Cataract dills; having on the north
the low lands through which the Tamar winds its way to the sea •
and on the south the undulating agricultural country. The greater
proportion of the population is located between the two hills, the
river, (which follows the course of the streets, going eastward and
westward,) and a line drawn parallel with it, at the distance of
about a mile. . Of late, however, the progress of building beyond
these boundaries has greatly extended, and a considerable popula-
tion resides on the northern bank of the river, on the surrounding
hills, and on the southern suburb. Ibe municipal boundaries include
an area of 3933 acres, or six square miles, the town proper being
built upon an area of about 800 acres, or one and a quarter square
miles. The streets were intended to be at right angles to each
other, but many of them present somewhat irregular lines. The
inequalities in the line of building, and the alternation of large and
small, of brick, or stone, and wooden houses, increase the want of
uniformity ; but in this latter respect great improvement is being
effected by the operation of the Building Law. Notwithstanding
that it must be admitted that the site was in the first place badly
chosen, the aspect of the Town and the river, from the surrounding
height, is very picturesque.
Biisbane-Street is the chief street, the buildings being larger and
more regular than elsewhere in the town. The principal** Book-
sellers and Drapers’ shops are in this street, while at its eastern
portion is the Government House, and the other houses are princi-
pally private residences ; and these circumstances, combined with
the tact that the street is in the centre of the Town, make it the
centre also of business and fashion.
A considerable proportion of the buildings in the streets is of a
superior character : such as the churches and chapels, the Bank of
Austi alasia, the Mechanics Institute, the principal hotels and
stores, the 1 lieatre, and many of the shops. Improvements in con-
nection with building are either projected, or are already in pro-
gress, which will add greatly to the appearance of several streets.
A pile of buildings, intended for Government Offices, will shortly
be commenced in St John-street, to extend the whole distance
between Cameron and Patterson-streets. A new Union Bank will
it is reported, be erected at the corner of Patterson and St. John-
streets; a free iresbyterian Church at the corner of Frederick and


St. John-streets ; an Episcopalian Church in Frankland-street in
the south ; a new Roman Catholic Church on the site of the present
one ; a Hospital on Mulgrave-square in the south ; a Savings Bank;
and a fountain is in course of erection on the square lying between
Frederick, St. John, Elizabeth, and Charles-streets. Religious,
benovelent, literary, scholastic, and other institutions of various
kinds are established. Besides the hotels, there are numerous
good inns and private lodging-houses. Launceston, from its
admirable position at the head of the great valley, in
which are the agricultural districts of Patterson’s Plains, Morven,
Norfolk Plains, and Westbury, and the pastoral districts of the
midland counties, and also from the circumstance that it possesses
quick and regular steam communication with the neighbouring
colonies, is the great outlet for the produce of the North.
The Bason , a beautiful little lake close to Launceston, is the scene
of many a joyous pic-nic. Fishing parties are frequently made up for
this locality by the townspeople ; and eels, herrings, and black-fish
reward their exertions, sometimes in considerable quantities.
The Patterson Plains road, with its cultivated fields and haw-
thorn hedges, affords a beautiful ride or drive ; and the frequency
with which the steamers proceed down the river, and return, renders
a trip to Kelso Bay, with its splendid Algm-covered beaches, and
George Town with its bracing sea air, a very easy matter.
The Horticultural Gardens and Assembly Rooms are both well
attended. The former, which are extensive, are well kept, and form
a delightful promenade.
The population of Launceston is about 8000, inhabiting 2024
houses. The assessed value of house property is £88,700 ; and the
rates for all purposes, such as police, paving, lighting, water, and
assessed taxes, amount to about 3s. in the pound of rental. The
Revenue of the Corporation is about £13,500 a-year.

Advantages of the Society.
All the profits of each branch belong to the members of
such branch. It is a colonial institution, on the model of
the most successful British Offices ; whilst from the much
higher rate of interest it obtains on its investments, more
profitable returns are secured to its members than the best
European offices can afford. Thus, at the investigation of
March, 1854, all policies then entitled to participate were
increased by Bonus Additions, averaging considerably more
than three per cent, per annum on the sum assured, or about
three times those secured by the most liberal British joint
stoc/c companies.
Bonuses may be applied to the extinction of future annual
premiums, or their value in cash may be handed to the
member.
Surrenders accepted on equitable terms.
General facilities with regard to voyaging, residence
abroad, &c.
