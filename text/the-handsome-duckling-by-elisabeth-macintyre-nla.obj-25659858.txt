Mrs. Hen was terribly proud of her
family. They were all very pretty,
but Leslie was specially handsome.

Mrs. Hen gave them all nice
warm mufflers and little straw hats.
She taught them all to eat and
drink daintily, but Leslie gobbled
up his food and then swam round
in the drinking water!
The chickens didn’t mind, they
all thought he was very clever.

But Leslie said “I am quite clever

Shirley KNEW she should not go,
but she went.


They ran down to the pond and
Shirley sat on Leslie’s back.
He swam round and round and
they both had a lovely time.


Then he said “You’re too heavy,
mp off and swim now!’
Poor little Shirley could not swim
all, she splashed wildly . . . .

and Richard
