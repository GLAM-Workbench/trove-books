NEW SOUTH WALES.
New South Wales is the oldest British colony in
Australia. It was established as a penal settlement in
1788. The extent of country then known under this
name included an area of 800,000 square miles; consider-
able portions of this vast territory have since been created
into two important and independent provinces?namely,
Queensland and Victoria. The fact of New South
Wales being for so many years a convict settlement, no
doubt, operated to its disadvantage as a place of volun-
tary emigration. During the period that transportation
continued in force 54,583 convicts were landed in
Sydney. In 1846 the convicts of all classes in New
South Wales amounted to 10,555. ? Convictism ? was
there abolished in 1850, and since that date the colony
has been gradually recovering from the effects of the
transportation system, and is beginning to take its place
among the chosen lands of English emigrants.
The population, according to the last census, was
351,860; that is, 198,488 males and 153,372 females.
The government is vested in a Governor, nominated by
the Crown, and a Legislative and Executive Council,
answering to our Lords and Commons.


CLIMATE.
The climate of New South Wales is considered to be
very salubrious, but from the great extent of the colony
and other causes, almost every variety of climate may
be found. The result of a year?s observation at Sydney
showed a medium temperature of 52� in the coldest
month, and of 75�� in the hottest; and in respect to
weather, about 240 dry days to 125 of rain.
NATURE OF THE COUNTRY.
New South Wales is admirably adapted both for
agricultural and pastoral purposes. Farming operations
are carried on extensively in all the settled parts of the
country, and the ? runs? for sheep are as fine as any to
be found in Australia.

ALIENS.
In New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland the
position of aliens is regulated by an Act 11 Viet., cap.
89, passed in 1847, by the Legislature of New South
Wales, which then included the other two colonies.
By this Act, children of a mother a natural born sub-
ject may acquire and hold both real and personal estate.
Aliens, subjects of a friendly state, may, without being
naturalised, hold every species of personal property,
except chattels real. But for the purposes of residence or
trade they may hold land and houses for twenty-one
years, with all the privileges of natural born subjects,
except that of voting at elections of members of the
Legislative Council.
All aliens may obtain the full privileges of natural
born subjects, except that of becoming members of the
Executive Council or Legislature, by memorialising the
Governor, obtaining a certificate from him (if he thinks
proper to grant it), and taking the oath of allegiance pre-
scribed in the Act, within sixty days from the date of
the certificate. The certificate is to be enrolled in the
Supreme Court of the colony. The judge administering
the oath is to grant a certificate of its having been taken.
The wives of natural bom subjects are to be deemed
to be naturalised.
REGULATIONS OBSERVED ON THE VOYAGE.
The following is an abstract of an order in Council for
promoting order and health in passenger ships to any of
Her Majesty?s possessions abroad ;
1. Every passenger to rise at seven a.m., unless otherwise
permitted by the surgeon, or, if no surgeon, by the master.


2. Breakfast from eight to nine a.m.; dinner at one
p.m.; supper at six p.m.
3. The passengers to be in their beds at ten p.m.,

passenger or family of passengers shall be entitled to the
use of the fires. The cook to take care that this order is
preserved.
6. On each passenger deck three safety lamps to be lit
at dusk, and kept burning all night, and such further
number as shall allow one to be placed at each of the
hatchways used by the passengers.
?. No naked light between deck or in the hold to be
allowed at any time, or on any account.
8. The passengers, when dressed, to roll up their beds,
to sweep the decks (including the space under the bottom
of the berths), and to throw the dirt overboard.
9. Breakfast not to commence till this is done.
10. The sweepers for the day to be taken in rotation
from the males above fourteen, in the proportion of five

OFFENCES AT SEA PUNISHABLE IN THE
COLONIES.
Formerly offences at sea might, under the Act 11 and
12 Wm. 111., cap. 7, be tried in any colony, and were to
be dealt with according to the civil law, and the method
and rules of the Admiralty ; and subsequently (under the
46 George 111., cap. 64), according to the common course
of the laws of this realm, applicable to like offences
committed on land. But now by 12 and 13 Viet., cap.
96 (1849), these offences, when dealt with in a colony,
are to be tried according to the law of the colony, but
punished according to the law of England.
The Act of Victoria, which was passed in August, 1849,
for the prosecution and trial in the colonies of offences
committed within the jurisdiction of the Admiralty,
provides that all persons charged in any colony with
piracy, felony, murder, ?or other offence of what nature
or kind soever? committed on the sea, or within the
Admiralty?s jurisdiction, may be brought to trial in the
same manner, according to the laws of the colony, as if
the offence had been committed on waters within the
local jurisdiction of the criminal courts of the colony,
and, upon conviction, shall suffer the same punishments
as they would have been liable to had the offence been
committed, tried, and adjudged in England.
EMPLOYMENT.
Industrious and healthy emigrants of both sekes will
find immediate and constant employment in this colony.
The gold of Victoria, and the cotton of Queensland, have
drawn so many, and directed the course of so many


more who would otherwise have settled in New South
Wales, that every description of labour is in request.
Agricultural labourers, married, receive from �SO to
�6O a year, with lodging and rations; a single man gets
�32 or sometimes �36. Young lads of from twelve to
fifteen years of age receive, with rations, about �ls or
�2O a year; bullock drivers, from �4O to �SO ; carters,
�SO ; bush carpenters, as they are called (the runners up
of log huts, shepherd stations, &c.), �45 or �SO; regular
carpenters, �75 or �80; fencers, �4O; gardeners, the
same; shoeing smiths, �BO ; stock-keepers, �4O ; all these
with huts to live in, or a lodging in the farm, and a
plentiful supply of meat, flour, tea, sugar, and milk.
Day-workers or week-workers are all well paid.
Brewers get Bs, a day; bricklayers, 12s. to 145.; coopers,
125.; coach-painters, 10s.; glaziers, 95.; iron
10s.; masons, 10s.; plasterers, 10s.; plumbers, 11s.;
quarrymen, 95.; shipwrights, 125.; stone-breakers, ss.
Engineers, blacksmiths, &c., receive first-rate wages, and
are in request. Shopmen in Sydney receive, on the
average, �6O a year, with board and lodging. No man
need fear of finding work to do or of getting wages,
that he might look in vain for at home, in the colony of
New South Wales. Although it is our oldest Australian
colony, for reasons already given, it is only within a
comparatively recent period that it has become attractive.
Now it is an excellent field for the exercise of labour
and the investment of capital.
Female domestic servants, thoroughly acquainted with
their duties, readily obtain situations on remunerative
terms; but there is a very small demand for governesses
and educated ladies; and the prospect of getting married
?to respectable men?is not much greater than it is at
a 3


home. We may here remark that the Colonial Govern-
ment makes the most careful provision for the protection
and effective settlement of the single women who come
to the colony under the auspices of the Emigration Com-
missioners, unaccompanied by friends or relatives. The
single women are landed and received into an institution
ready for their reception, where they are treated with
the greatest care, and allowed to remain for a few days
to wash and mend their clothes and make preparations
for service. When they are reported by the matron to
be ready, a hiring day is appointed, which is advertised
in the daily papers. No person is admitted into the
hiring-room who is not personally known to the officers
of the department to be of good character, or who has
not a certificate of respectability from a clergyman or
magistrate. The average rate of wages given to cooks
and laundresses is from �25 to �3O per annum ; to dairy-
maids, farm and house servants, from �l5 to �25 per
annum; this rate of wages refers also to house-maids,
kitchen-maids, ladies?-maids, nurses, needlewomen,
waitresses, &c.; all of whom, it must be understood,
receive in addition both board and lodging.
COST OF CLOTHING, PROVISIONS, &c.
To workmen receiving daily or weekly wages, without
rations, the cost of living is a matter of the greatest
importance, and in New South Wales the usual tariff is
high. It is not, however, much higher, and in some
instances it is below, that of the colony of Victoria.
We append a tabular statement of average prices in New
South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. In Queens-
land the cost of almost all articles of clothing is about
one-fourth higher than it is in England.

The sale of land in New South Wales is now regulated
by two Acts; Nos. 1 and 2 of 25 Viet., 1861, entitled,
respectively, ?An Act for Regulating the Alienation of
Crown Lands,? and ? An Act for Regulating the Occu-
pation of Crown Lands.? A summary of the second Act,
which relates to pasture licences and mining leases, will
be found at pp. 15?17.
The first Act regulates the sale of lands. After repeal-
ing the Orders in Council and Regulations issued under


the Imperial Acts 5 & 6 Yict., cap. 36, and 9 & 10 Yict.,
cap. 104, and making provision for reserves for town
sites, internal communication, and other purposes of
defence, public worship, instruction, health, recreation,
and convenience or enjoyment; and after exempting
from sale Crown lands held under lease, or promise of
lease, made previous to the 22nd of February, 1858; and
after providing for sales, without competition, of small
portions of land on which improvements have been made,
and in certain other special cases, it proceeds to enact
that all Crown lands shall be sold either by way of con-
ditional sale without competition, or by auction.
Classification of Lands. ?Crown lands are divided into
four classes, viz.: ? town lands,? being those in or set
apart as a site for any city, town, or village; ? suburban
lands? (declared in the Gazette to be such) ; ? first-class
settled districts,? and ?second-class settled districts.?
Auction. ?Town lands and suburban lands without
improvements are to be sold by public auction only, at
upset prices of not less than �8 per acre for the former,
and �2 for the latter; the upset price of other Crown
lands intended to be sold without conditions of residence
and improvement, is not to be less than �1 per acre. If
no sale is effected at the first auction the lands may again
be put up to auction, and, with the exception of town
and suburban lands, may in the interim be purchased at
the upset price, if not previously withdrawn from sale by
the Government.
Mode of Payment. ?One-fourth of the purchase money
is to be paid at the time of sale, and the remainder within
three months.
Conditional Sale?By the plan of ?conditional sale?


any one may, on certain notified days, make to the land
agent of the district a written application for the con-
ditional purchase of not less than 40, nor more than 320
acres, accompanied by a deposit of one-fourth of the
purchase money, at the rate of �1 an acre. He will
then be declared the conditional purchaser, unless there
be more than one application for the same land or any
part of it, in which case the successful candidate is to be
determined by lot. The lands to be selected under this
system must, however, not be town or suburban lands,
nor within a proclaimed gold field, unless unoccupied for
gold mining purposes, and must not be within certain
distances of towns or villages, varying from ten to two
miles, according to the population of the place; nor re-
served for town sites or other public purposes.
At the expiration of three years and three months the
purchaser has the option of paying the balance of the
purchase money, and receiving a conveyance in fee, or of
deferring the payment indefinitely, by paying interest at
the rate of five per cent, per annum on the amount,
within three months after the Ist of January in each
year. The purchaser, however, must in either case prove
to the satisfaction of the Minister of Public Lands that he
has made improvements to the extent and value required
by the Act, that he has bond fide resided continuously
either by himself or his alienees on the land, and that
he has not alienated it until after, at least, one year?s
bond fide residence thereon.
There are some other minor provisions for effecting
conditional purchase, under mining conditions (other
than gold mining), when the price is to be 40s. an acre;
and for determining values and matters in dispute by
appraisement and arbitration.


PASTURE LAND.
The following is the substance of the principal pro-
visions of the Crown Lands Occupation Act, No. 2, of
25 Viet., 1861. For the purposes of the Act the Crown
lands are divided into three classes; viz., ? first-class
settled districts,? ? second-class settled districts,? and
? unsettled districts.? It repeals the Acts of Council,
11 Viet., No. 61, and 16 Viet., No. 29, and the Orders
in Council and Regulations issued under the Imperial
Act, 9 and 10 Viet., cap. 104, saving all rights already-
acquired under them. It empowers the Governor, with
the advice of the Executive Council, to proclaim any part
of the unsettled districts to be within the ? second-class
settled districts,? but so as not to affect existing leases.
It prohibits the renewal of existing leases, except
under the provisions of the Act, and enables the Govern-
ment to withdraw from any runs lands required for
town or village sites, for internal communications, or
for any public purpose whatever.
It then provides that Crown lands not comprised
within ? old runs ? (that is, runs under leases or licences
granted or contracted to be granted before the 22nd of
February, 1858, in the second-class settled or unsettled
districts), or not comprised within certain distances of
towns or villages, and not being public reserves, may
be leased, subject to the provisions of the Gold Fields
Act, 20 Viet., No. 29, and without competition, for
pastoral purposes, for one year if in the first-class
settled districts, and for five years if within the second-
class settled districts or the unsettled districts?or if
required for ferries, bridges, wharves, machinery for saw


mills, &c.?and for fourteen years if for mineral pur-
poses other than gold mining.
Leases of runs in the first-class settled districts are to
contain not less than one square mile, and are all to ex-
pire on the 31st of December, with- the right, however,
of renewal annually, by payment of a rent for the
ensuing year, at the rate of �2 per square mile, or such
higher rate as the lessees may be paying, subject, never-
theless, to the right of the Government to withdraw the
lands for sale, or for any public purpose. Existing leases
under the regulations of the 29th of March, 1848, are
not to be renewed under those regulations, but may be
converted into leases under the Act if advantage be
taken of the option within two months of the publica-
tion of the Gazette notice to that effect. The holders of
land in fee simple may also acquire, without compe-
tition, at the rent of �2 per square mile, leases of adjoin-
ing land to the extent of three times their purchase land.
Competitors for the same tract of land are to have it
divided between them by arbitration. Crown lands
not previously underleased, or subject to a pre-empted
right of lease, are to be sold by auction after one month?s
notice of sale in the Gazette , at an upset price of �1 per
square mile, or of 10s. if half the current year should
have expired; and the whole of the purchase money is to
be paid at the time of sale. If not sold at auction the
land may be afterwards purchased by private contract at
the upset price ; but the sale by the Government of any
portion of the laud under lease is to cancel so much of
the lease as relates to the land sold and to three times
the adjoining area. (Sects. 2 and 12.)
With regard to lands in the ? second-class settled
districts? or in the ?unsettled districts,? the Governor,


with the advice of the Executive Council, may grant
leases, subject to the following conditions:?l. Exist-
ing leases of runs may be converted into leases for five
years under the Act, by payment within two months
of the Gazette notice of a rent to be determined by
appraisement of the fair annual value (exclusive of im-
provements) of the lands for pastoral purposes; and on
such conversion the runs cease to be liable to assessment
under the Act 22 Viet., No. 17. 2. Leases of ? old
runs? may, on their expiration, be in like manner con-
verted into leases for five years. 3. After the first
year the rent is to be payable on the 31st of December,
with a fine of eight per cent, if in arreaf not more than
three months, and of ten per cent, if more than three
months; and if in arrear six months, the lease to be for-
feited. 4. These leases are not to confer any right to
purchase by pre-emption. 5. The Crown may resume,
without compensation (except a return of a proportionate
part of the rent), any of the lands under lease required
for town or village sites, or for any public purpose what-
ever ; but the lessee has then the option of surrendering
the lease, if he thinks fit, and obtaining a refund of the
full balance of the rent. (Sect. 13.)
The Governor, with the advice of the Executive
Council, may proclaim pastoral districts in the ? second-
class settled? or in the ? unsettled districts.?


GOLD MINING EEGULATIONS.
As regards gold, mining is regulated by a Colonial
Act, 25 Viet., No. 4, passed 22nd November, 1861,
called ? The Gold Fields Act, 1861.? This Act repeals
the 20 Viet., No. 29, except so far as relates to persons
mining for gold in land belonging to private individuals
?without their consent. It empowers the Governor to
proclaim Crown lands to be gold fields, and to grant
?miners? rights,? at a fee of 10s., between the Ist
January and 30th June, and ss. after that date, subject
to certain regulations to be prescribed by the Governor
in Council. All miners? rights are to terminate on the
31st December in each year.
The Governor in Council may also grant ? business
licences,? which must terminate on 31st December in
each year, the fee for which is �l, if granted between Ist
January and 30th June, and 10s. if granted after the
30 th June.
Leases of auriferous lands may be obtained in ac-
cordance with the laws in force for the time being.
The rent is to be fixed by the Governor in Council.
Aliens not holding a ? miner?s right ? to be fined �5
for mining for gold, or for residing on a gold field. A
similar penalty is imposed on any person carrying on
business without a licence. Any one employing persons
not holding a ? miner?s right,? or a lease or licence,
forfeits his ? claim ?or holding. The Governor may,
however, remit the forfeiture if the ? claim ? is held by
virtue of a business licence or lease.
The Act also provides for the partial suspension of
pastoral leases extending over gold fields, and for the


passage of water through freehold property ; and directs
how Commissioners may be appointed, and regulationa
made by the Governor; prescribes the remedy (a sum-
mary one before justices) for encroachments, and defines
the duties of assessors, and the mode of securing com-
pensation ; regulates the assessors? fees, and the mode of
recovery, and penalties for their non-attendance.
Persons resisting officers are liable to be fined �25, or
imprisoned for a term not exceeding three months.
Further regulations relate to the establishment and
control of licensed public-houses on the gold fields;
authorise the constitution of a local court for determining
mining questions, and define the powers of a court of
appeal; and relate to the punishment for forgery,,
personation, and fraud.
Holders of ? miners? rights,? or of leases, are entitled,
both in New South Wales and in Victoria, to vote for
the members of the local court for the district in which
they reside. These courts are for the consideration of
matters connected with the general management of the
district. In Victoria, however, Chinese are disqualified
from voting for members of mining boards by the Colonial
Act 25 Viet., No. 132.
Additional regulations have been issued having reference
to the passage of water through freehold property, the
holding of business licences, and the leasing of lands for
mining purposes other than gold (under the Crown
Lauds Occupation Act), which may afterwards be found
to contain gold. These regulations were published on the
19th September, 1862, 17th November, 1862, and 31st
December, 1862, respectively. Regulations have also
been issued (on 18th February, 1863) for carrying into
effect the ? frontage system ? at the gold fields.


The escort of gold from the principal gold fields is
undertaken by Government, free of charge, if intended
for export, otherwise a small charge per ounce is made,
according to distance.
The duty on gold exported from New South Wales,
whether by sea or land, is now fixed at 2s. 6d. the troy
ounce, but the customs duty is not to be leviable on gold
which has paid duty at the Mint.
GOLD FIELDS OF NEW SOUTH WALES.
WESTERN DISTRICT.
1. Ophir , or Summerhill Creek , in the county of Rox-
burgh, and its tributaries, Lewis Ponds Creek, and Emu
Swamp Creek.
Summerhill Creek is about forty miles long, and
empties itself into the Macquarie River. The tributaries
are each about fifteen miles long.
The country intersected by these waters is clay-slate,
abounding with veins of quartz, many of which are
known to be, and the rest probably are, auriferous.
Summerhill Creek is the first place where gold was
discovered, in sufficient quantity to be worth working, in
May, 1851.
?Ophir, as compared with last year, has somewhat
improved in prospects; new leads of gold are occasionally
found in this district.?? Extract from Gold Commissioners ?
Report, May , 1855.
2. Turon River , in the county of Roxburgh, with
various tributaries.
This river is about fifty miles long, and empties itself
into the Macquarie about twelve miles above the junction
of Summerhill Creek.


The country is clay-slate intersected by quartz veins,
some of which are superficially highly auriferous.
The Turon was first occupied in June, 1851.
? The Turon continues to yield a considerable quantity
of gold, and as fast as one spot becomes apparently ex-
hausted of its treasure another equally rich is discovered.?
?Gold Commissioners' Report , May , 1855.
3. Meroo River and its tributaries, Louisa Creek ana
others.
This river is about forty miles long, emptying itself
into the Cudgegong, which empties itself into the Mac-
quarie about twelve miles below its junction with the
Meroo.
The country is clay-slate with numerous quartz veins.
On Louisa Creek one hundredweight of gold was dis-
covered by Dr. Kerr.
?The Meroo is perhaps at this moment the most
flourishing gold field in this district, as it is also one of
the greatest extent, the auriferous deposits extending
over a very large tract of country; this field alone is
sufficiently large to give employment to*ten times as
many diggers as there are at present in New South
Wales.?? Gold Commissioners' Report , May , 1855.
4. Tamboroura Creelc. ?This creek is about twenty
miles long, and empties itself into the Macquarie between
the Meroo and the Turon, from each of which it is distant
twenty miles, running parallel to them.
The country is clay-slate with quartz veins.
In the Western District a new gold field has been
opened up, called ? The Lachlan,? being in the vicinity
of the river of that name. This field has proved to be
one of the most important and extensive fields yet dis-
covered in New South Wales. One remarkable feature,


which distinguishes it from all other fields of this colony,
is, that the gold is struck in leads , and is obtained by
deep sinking, varying from 100 to 180 feet. Another
has also been discovered, called ? The King?s Plains and
Belubula Rivulet Gold Field; ? but the workings here are
root of a very important character.
SOUTHERN DISTRICT.
o'. The Abercrombie River and its tributaries, Tuena
'Creek, Rockybridge Creek, Cappohamia or Oakey Creek,
and Isabella River. This river is about sixty miles long,
and runs parallel to the Turon, at a distance of eighty
miles to the southward, emptying itself into the Lachlan
River.
The country is clay-slate with the usual quartz veins.
6. Araluen River and its tributaries, Bell?s Creek, and
Major?s Creek. This river is about thirty miles long,
and runs into the Moruya River, which last empties
itself into the sea near Broulee, about 150 miles south of
Port Jackson.
In the opinion of the Crown Commissioner, Mr. Hardy,
the Araluen gold field was likely to become the principal
one of the colony.
The country is granite in the upper portion, compris-
ing the table land from which it rises. About fifteen
miles down the country is clay-slate with quartz veins,
known to be auriferous. Besides these, two other gold
fields have been opened, one on the Marunga and the
other close to Braidwood. Some prolific diggings have
also recently been discovered at the Buffalo Range, about
thirty miles south-east of Spring Creek.
The Southern District has now, for more efficient
supervision, been separated into two distinct districts.


the South-Western and the Southern. During the last
three years several new gold fields have been discovered in
these districts: in the former, the Burrangong, Muttinia,
Corowa, Adjungbilly, Black Eange, and Gundagar
Fields; in the latter, Kiandra Gulph and Shoalhaven.
Of these, Burrangong is by far the most important, and
may be said to rank next to the Lachlan.
PASTORAL DISTRICT.
7. Liverpool Plains , Hanging Rock, and Peel River. ?
Gold has likewise been discovered at Swampook and
Ironbook Creeks, but has never been worked.
8. New England, within and upon the boundaries of
the Kentucky Balala and Saumorez runs, is situate on
the Kentucky Creek and Rocky River.
9. Gwydir, Bingara. ?This gold field extends from the
table lands at the sources of the Bingara and Courongara
Creeks to the junction of those creeks with the Gwydir,
including an area of seventeen by five miles, which com-
prises also the Bora and Spring Creeks, both auriferous.
10. Murrumbidgee, Adelong, near Gundajoi. ?The
miners average from 255. to 30s. per day; Tumberamba.
This creek falls into the River Hume, with a course nearly
south; it is about fifteen miles beyond Adelong. Miners
average from 15s. to 255. per day. Gold has also been
discovered on the east bank of the Tumut River, in the
county of Buccleuch. There are now about 150 men
on this new field, and the results are such as lead to the
belief that a considerable population will fix upon this
field as diggings worthy of their labours.


FREE PASSAGES.
Free passages are granted to New South Wales. The
system is carried on by means of passage certificates,
obtained only from the Colonial Government by residents
on payment of the following sums; ?Male under twelve
years, �3 ; under forty, �5 ; under fifty, �8 ; above fifty,
�l2. Female under twelve, �2; under forty, �3 ; under
fifty, �6; above fifty, �l2. The nominees must be
either mechanics, domestic servants, or persons of the
labouring class, in good health, and of moral character.
Messrs. Houlder Brothers and Co., of 146, Leadenhall
Street, London, dispatch vessels to Sydney, New South
Wales, on the 11th and 25th of every month, from the
London Docks. These ships are of the highest class,
well equipped, and in every way adapted for all classes
of passengers.
Intending emigrants are advised to select their outfit
and cabin requisites at some respectable colonial outfitter?s,
of which there are several in London. E. J. Monnery
and Co., 165, Fenchurch Street, is one of the oldest
establishments of that class. They publish an illustrated
price list, which may be had free on application; and
every information as to the most suitable articles will be
afforded by them.


MISCELLANEOUS INFORMATION.
The latest authentic statistics of the colony are fur-
nished by official returns corrected to the end of 1862.
We subjoin some interesting items of information, which
will be worthy of the attention of emigrants. The
population on the 31st of December, 1862, was very
carefftlly estimated at 367,495; 205,531 males and
161,964 females. The disparity of the sexes, always
an evil in colonies, was gradually diminishing. Ten
years before there were 765 females to every 1,000 males;
but in 1862 there were 788 to each 1,000; and that
notwithstanding that in the first five years of the inter-
vening period the female immigrants to the colony very
nearly equalled the males in number, while in the five
years, 1858-62, the male immigrants were very nearly
3 to 1 of the female.
The census of 1861 shows the number of persons
engaged in each of the leading departments of colonial
industry: and the proportions to the entire population
remain essentially the same. About 18,500 were skilled
workmen; more than 20,000 were engaged in gold-
digging ; nearly 1,000 in coal-mining (a branch of
industry capable of immense development, for some of
the richest coal-fields in the world are within the limits
of the colony) ; 37,400 were engaged in agriculture, of
whom more than one-half were hired farm servants, and
11,000 tenant farmers. An equal nu tuber found employ-
ment as stockmen and shepherds. Some 13,000 unskilled


workmen found employment; and there were nearly
40,000 whose occupations could not be ascertained.
On the 31st of March, 1863, there were 302,138 acres
under tillage. Nearly 4,300,000 acres were the property
of freeholders, two-thirds being in the settled districts ;
and there were 55,000,000 acres held on lease: nearly
62,000,000 were in the pastoral districts. In the
settled districts each freeholder had, on the average,
338 acres of freehold laud. t
There were, in 1862, 30 coal-mines in actual
operation, producing 476,522 tons of coal, the greater
portion of which was exported; 131 steam mills; 859
manufactories with steam power; 30 soap and candle
works; and 30,528 cattle and 48,097 sheep were ren-
dered into tallow. More than 25,000 licences were
issued to gold diggers; but the average find for each
man employed did not exceed in value �B9 per annum.
21,000,000 lbs. of wool were exported.
There were, at the end of 1862, 354 places of worship,
405 Sunday-schools, and 925 educational establishments
of various kinds.
