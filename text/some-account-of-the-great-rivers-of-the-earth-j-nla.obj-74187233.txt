SOME ACCOUNT OF THE GREAT
RIVERS OF THE EARTH.
The following interesting paper was read
by the Rev, J. Garlick before the Science
Society, in the Hall of the School of Mines,
on the 21st September, 1891 :
In attempting to give some account of the
great rivers of the earth, I have nothing new
to say or any original theories to propound.
My object is simply to put together and ex-
press in my own words, order, and sequence,
certain facts and information that are avail-
able to anybody who will be at the troable to
devote himself to the task of tracing maps
and searching out the data that may be
found under various heads in our geographies
and encyclopedias. In order that my ac- i
count may be such as shall convey instruction
and be interesting to you, it is necessary, at
the outset, that we should come to an under- j
standing as to the definite meaning of certain |
technical terms, and as regards the scope I
propose to cover. Let me at once then first
define a few of the terms I shall have to
make use of. By the ? source? of a river, I
mean its first beginning, not only the place
where it rises, but also and especially the
collection of springs, streamlets, or melting
snows, that bring it into being and ever con-
tribute to its growth. The basin is the
whole tract* cicountry drained by the river
and its tributaries, or those other rivers and
streams which flow into it. By ? water-shed,?
I mean a parting, a line of division, an
imaginary line or boundary which runs
along the ridge of separation between ad-
jacent seas, lakes, or river basins,
an elevation, that is, which represents the
limit from which the water naturally flows in
opposite directions. The ?mouth? is, of course,
that part of the river through which the waters
are discharged into the sea, or other large
body of water. A ? delta,? so-called from its
resemblance to the Greek letter ?D, is .the
triangular - shaped island formed by the
alluvial deposits between the mouths of a
river, and the sea, e.g. the Delta of the Nile
formed at the confluence of its two mouths
named (Rashid) Rosetta, and (Dimyat)
Damietta with the Mediterranean Sea. And,
j lastly with respect to the title and scope of
my subject, by ? The Great Rivers of the
| Earth,? I mean not a detailed description of
! all the mighty streams or anything like a
| complete list of them, but, in the first place, a


-qufc selection of those rivers of the old and
00? new worlds that are greatest in length,
and volume, together with some
Ifijerenco to their particular characteristics
?? historical association, and in the second
hI e some very much humbler rivers, which
sift reason of their extraordinary usefulness
erldl or of the benefits they dispense,
t>e deemed entitled to be called
reat.? As a rule, 1 shall confine myself
i icipally to ihe main streams, and
dly refer at all to their tributaries,
wever large and important they
ni y be. And, now, having done
w,�th preliminaries, let us plunge ?in
Sdias res. 1 ' In the earliest record we have
> i 'he earth, as the habitation of man, there
u: nention made of a river which went out to
Y tor that part, wherever it was situated,
V ; ch we are accustomed to look back upon
Jie cradle of the human race, viz., the
G rdon of Eden. ? And from thence,? the
account in the second chapter of Genesis
tells us, ?it became four heads,? and the
names of these four heads are given as Pison,
Gfoon, Hiddekel, and Euphrates. Of these,
as a matter of fact, the last two have always
been identical with the Tigris in Western
Asia, and which still retains the name
Hiddekel amongst large numbers of persons
who d� ell on its fertile banks, and, with
the Euphrates, in the same locality, or Phrath,
orelFrat, which, takes its rise in Asiatic Tu-
rkey. Much uncertaintyattachestoallattempts
that have been made to identify either the
original river, which is said to have become
four heads, or the other two heads, Pison
and Gihon. Before these can positively be
traced, the problem as to Eden and its site
wil 1 require to be demonstrably solved. The
most ancient and the most universally re-
ceived opinion, however, is that Pison is
identical with the Ganges, and Gihon with
the Nile. Josephus, Eusebius and many
other ancient writers held this view. But at
Dost such views rest only upon conjecture,
... t so, however, with respect to the
ddekal and Euphrates; their identification
never been lost, and therefore a know-
h age of these rivers must be regarded as
oval with the existence of man. The Tigris
ius its principal source in the Turkish pro-
province of Diarbekir, a few miles only to the
?ast of the Euphrates. It is navigable for
i-aV s, at certain seasons, from Diarbekir to
Mosul, a distance of about 300 miles, and
nearly all the year round from Mosul to


'Bagdad. Large rafts, called Kelek , s
ported by inflated skins, sometimes from
, to 400 in number are used for transport
cargo. The total length of the river is 1,5
miles. Its breadth gradually increases.
Piarbekir from 100 to 250 yards,
the vrar between the Romans and
Parthians, it was for a short time
boundary line between these two empu
The Euphrates is a larger and more important
river, being 1,71 fl nfllesjong before its jun -
tion with the Tigris, Its ijame gigpi/jes ? the
good anel abound in river,? and it is rapst fre*
quently referred to in the Bible by the te(*fu,
? The river.? It rises from two chief sources
in the Armenian mountains. The area of it?
basiil is 260,000 square miles. The strean
sluggish aud, in the flood season, when ti/e
snows melt in the Armenian highlands, J, t
extends far out from its tfle result
that considerable tracts of country are
gated and covered with productive cultiva-
tion. It was on this river?on both its banks
?that the once famous city of Babylon was
built. IjLevodetus has handed down to pos-
terity a vivid description of the glories of
that great pity, He gives dimensions of
its entire ares as 200 square and
seems to imply that the pf
this space was occupied by houses, some of
them two and three stories high. He speaks
of the brazen gates which guarded the quays
which lined the river banks throughout that
nart of its course which intersected the
city, It was hero, too, that Nebuchadnezzar,
Babylon?s great king, tried his engineering
skill upon the gigantic hydraulic works that
are ascribed to him, his object being to con-
trol the annual inundation to which the i
country was subjected by the overflow of the |
river. Dr, Smith, in his ? Biblical Dic-
tionary,? says There are good grounds-�fot
beiicyipg that throughout the Babylonian
and Persia# periods this river was the regular
passage of communication from the Mediter-
ranean to Babylon. ? The v'm? would appear
to be wearing itself out, for modern dpgppw.i
pons tell us that although it still brinipl
down as much water as of old, yet t&tl
precious element is wasted by the neglect Vj,'
man; that the varies watercourses alor?.o
which it was, in former times, CPPfeyed are
dry ; that the main channel has shrunk,
tflat the water stagnates in unwholesome
marshes.? After its union with the Tigris'/
the Shatt-el-Arab as the river is than!
called, presents to the view banks


covered with villages and cultivation.
deed? the greater part of the land above the
junction, portion enclosed by the two
rivers, and called by the Greeks ? ? Mesopo-
tamia,? is said to be of the richest and
finest country in the world. .Qne conse-
quence of the sluggishness of the stroaift i? �
constantly increasing deposit of mud at the |
mouths ; this causes a gradual increase of
land about the delta. By careful measure- j
ment it has been ascertained that the delta
of the Euphrates is increasing at the rate of
one mile in 30 years ; and this is double the
rate of increase of any other known delta. It
only in sluggish rivers, or in those whose
stream checked by the tide, or in the gulfs
or inland where the tides are small,
that deltas occur. V7h r en there are strong
! ebb-tides or rapid currents the alluvial
i accumulations brought dowp fyy the river
are swept away. The largest delta? occur
in the Mississippi, the Ganges, tlje Rhone, :
the Danube, the Rhine and the Pp. The |
area of Asia is estimated at nearly seventeen
and a half millions of square miles, a region
nearly six times as large as Australia, and as
its mountain chains are of great extent, and
their culminating points the highest in the
world, it follows, almost ae a corollary, that
its' river systems also are amongst the
greatest in the world. Thibet, the most
elgvated and extensive table-land in Asia,
having a mean height of 15,000 feet above
the sea level, gives rise to some of the
largest rivers of Southern and South-
Eastern Asia. The Indus is one pf these;
it is the chief stream of the north-west pf
Hindostan, and one of the great rivers of
the Globe; it is 1,800 miles long, and its
basin capacity is 370,000 square miles. The
British fort Atak, or Attock, is situated on
this riyer, where it attains a breadth of 800
yards." It is bare joined by the Kabul from
Afghanistan. ? So fap jts course has been
through tbe for the re-
mainder of its distance, nearly a thousand
miles, it continues, generally speaking, in a
south-westerly direction, until it empties its
waters into the Indian Ocean. In passing
through the low-lying lands, its waters, in
their course, become heavily charged with
mud, and so enormous is the amount of
alluvium brought down by the river that it
has been calculated to be sufficient for an
annual formation of 42 miles long, 27 miles
wide, and 40 feet deep. The Indus has, for
been the i. :M\ route for the conveyance


of 'merchandise between India and Central
Asia. The Brahmapootra is another of the
rivers which the plateau of Thibet sends forth
to pursue its changeful course to the sea. Its
sources, not yet explored by Europeans, are
supposed to be situated near Lake Manasaro-
war in Thibet, near those of the Indus.
It is the largest river in India,
and in a certain sense is a twin-sister
of the River Ganges; they both take their
rise from the opposite sides of the same
mountains, the periods of their rise and fall
nearly exactly coincide; they both belong to 1
the same geographical division of India, viz.,
Hindostan, and, although at one point their
divergence from each other is 1,200 miles,
they finally unite their waters at Luckipoor,
where they form a wide gulf, communicating
with the Sea of Bengal. The course of the
Brahmapootra is estimated at about 2,000
miles. The Ganges inclusive of windings, is
about the same length. 1,960 miles. Many
ancient well-known cities are situated on the
banks of this river, which has always been an .
object of the greatest veneration by the j
natives of Hindostan, Amongst these I need
only mention Allahabad,Bahar, Calcutta and
Benares. This last mentioned city is built
of freestone, and has a splendid panorama of
magnificent temples, mosques, palaces and
other highly decorated houses. The Hindoos
call it Kasi the Splendid. And it is not only
the ambition, but the greatest happiness, of
a Hindoo to be allowed to die at Benares,
because it is regarded as the most sacred
place in all India, and to die there is thought
to insure immediate admission into heaven.
To bathe in, and to drink, the waters
of the Ganges, is considered a sacred duty
of every Hindoo, and whenever a sick
person is thought to be near his death, his
friends hasten, if possible, to carry him to
the banks of this famous river that he may
drink its water before he dies, and so be
exempt from the necessity of returning to
this world to begin a new life. And those
who live too far from the stream, to be thus
treated, take care to preserve, in a copper
vessel, some of the precious fluid that it may
be giv en to them in the hour of death. It is
customary also, after the dead have been
cremated, to preserve the ashes until an
opportunity offers of throwing them into
their sacred river. Indeed thousands ol
bodies are precipitated into the stream every
year without cremation. Some parts of tfie
j river, especially those t ' flow from spN,l|h


to north, contrary to the usual direction, are 1
regarded as peculiarly sacred.
Time will not permit to refer to all the
great rivers which intersect the various divi-
sions of Asia, but two other mighty streams
which take their rise from this highest table-
land in Asia, ?the plateau of Thibet ?I must
briefly notice, and they are the Yang-tse-
Kiang and the Hohang-Ho. The former of
these is generally named, throughout its
entire length, the Yang-tse by European
geographers, although this name is applied
in China, through which country the river
runs to the lower part of its course only. The
whole river is called Kiang, or Ta Kiang?
the river or great river. In its upper course, it
is sometimes called the Kin-Cha-Kiang. In a
direct line it extends 1,800 miles, but its devi-
ous and winding course reaches considerably
over 3,000 miles. It is essentially a Chinese
river, for after flowing for more than a
thousand miles it crosses the frontier of the
flowery land, and pursues its course through
the very heart of the empire for over 2,000
miles before it empties into the Yellow Sea.
It follows an easterly direction?that taken
by all the great rivers of China, except the
Eu-ho, which flows north. This river and
the ports of Chin Kiang and HangKow were
opened to foreign navigation by the Treaty
of Tientsin in 1860. A British squadron
sailed for upwards of 800 miles from its
mouth in 1861. The tidal influence reaches
at one part of the year a distance of 436
miles from the sea. The Hohang-ho is the
next in size, and has a course in China of
more than 2,000 miles, and of 600 miles
before it enters the empire. During the
larger and lower part of this course it gra-
dually approaches the Yang-tse-Kiang, and
being connected with it by the Imperial 1
Canal, which has a length of 700 miles, it
furnishes what is said to be the most magni-
ficent system of water communication in the
world?a system which brings all the
provinces into direct water contact
with each other. In the north it
cuts the great wall of China, It is
a turbid stream, and is little used by the
Chinese far navigation. It is subject to
frequent floods which prove very destructive
to the cities and wide range of country
situated in its vicinity. The inhabitants
seek to mitigate the effects of this constantly
recurring disaster by erecting, at the cost of
enormous expense, and labor, artificial em-
bankments to guide and confine the super-


abundant waters. It derives its name,
Hohang-Ho, from thg vast qijaijtitles of
yellow mud held in solution byche gtreajp,
and which, together with asimilar ingredient
in the waters of the Yang-tse-Kiang, must,
in very large measure, be held responsible
for the sickly color of the Yellow Sea. It
has been calculated that the accumulation of
mud deposited in the Yellow Sea will be
sufficient in 24,000 years to convert the
sea into dry land. The united basins of
these two gigantic sister rivers enclose an
area of one million and a quarter square
miles. In the north of Asia is the vast
plain of Sioerra, or what is shortly styled
Russia in Asia; this forms the great
southern basin of the Arctic Ocean. Its
rivers number po less than 43, many of
which are, for a considerable portion of the
year, completely frozen oyer, Jp the south
west of Siberia there ia an enormous stretch
of low lands containing a considerable extent
of steppes or plains and deserts, and also the
inland sea of Aral, which is the receptacle
of the internal drainage from the basins
of the River Syr Daria, the A moo
or Oxus, which some writers identify with
the branch Gihon of Eden?s river. But the
four greatest rivers of this part qf Asia,
which I shall briefly refer to are the Yenesei,
the Obi, the Lena, and the Amur, The
Yenesei is the amalgamation of numerous
streams m hich take their rise in the moun-
tain ranges bordering the Chinese and the
Russian empires. It flows from south to
north, nearly through the middle of Siberia,
a distance, inclusive of its windings, of 3,400
miles. Its outlet is through the Yeniseisk
Gulf, into the Arctic Ocean, opposite the
western side of two long islands of Russian
territory, which much resemble New Zea-
land, and which are Nova Zembla.
Its basin capacity is more than a million
square miles. Steamers of large siae traffic
on its water, and its abundant fish supply
affords the principal article of food to the
numerous inhabitants dwelling op its banks
and in the adjacent districts.
The Obi, the mighty river in the west of
Siberia, which flows into the Obi Gulf, and
thence into the Arctic Ocean, is said 1 1 have
the lafgest basin area of any river in the
wqrld, yi�h tlfe exception of those two
monsters, jthe Mpsjsippi and the Amazon, in
North and South America respectively, ft
is estimated at not jess than X,38C),000 square
miles, considerably more titan a third of the


whole extent of Europe.lt has two very diver?
gent sources, the one, the upper stream
called the Irtish, rises in the Ural Moun-
tains, bordering between Europe and Siberia,
! and the other called the Upper Obi, has its
I origin in the Altai Mountains in the Chinese
Empire. Its entire length is 2,520 miles.
The Lena is the great river in the east of
Siberia, It rises on the north west shore of
the va*t inland lake of Baikal, down near
the south bpundary, in this part of Russian
Asia, whu?h we have fouffil to �e so prolific
of great rivers, It is said t,Q drain mote than
a million sonar� miles of gonntry, There is
one thing that makes th� river Lena note?
worthy and remarkable, and that is the fact
that the coldest inhabited spot on the whole
fa,oe of the globe is situated on it. The bleak
town qi Yakutsk, the capital of the Russian
Government, of the gajng name, is situated
on a wide plain surrounded by lofty heights,
on the left bank of the Lena, Tfie {muses of
the native inhabitants have walls built of
gow dung, roofs of earth, doors covered with
hairy hides, and windows of ice. The Euro-
pean houses dotted about amongst these are
said to present a very striking and curious
spectacle. The inhabitants are about 5,000,
and the trade is large and important, as
Yakutsk is the principal emporium of the j
whole of Eastern Siberia. Although the
ground is frozen to the depth of 600 feet, the
summer heat is strong enough to thaw it
sufficiently deep for cultivation, and wheat
and rye are successfully grown. _ The river
in its passage to the Arctic ocean is, for most
of the yeai?, through banks of frozen mud ;
and in the summer prodigious masses of this
are borne along, the turbulent stream, and
these masses are extremely precious in the
eyes of naturalists, inasmuch as they contain
numerous bones of many huge animals,
which, at some extinct and remote period,
flourished in this cold region of the globe.
The Amur, or the Amoor, forms the boun
dary line between the south east of Siberia
and the district of Manchooria, the eastern
territory of the Chinese empire. It rises in
the south east of the Yablonoi or Stanovoi
mountains. Its course is, first 800 miles in a
"south easterly direction, then 800 miles north
east, and after following, in all, 1,600 miles
it empties into the Pacific Ocean between the
Sea of Okhotsk and the Sea of Japan, opposite
to the Island of Saghalien. The upper course
is navigable for only two or three months in
the year being ice bound during the remain-


ins; portion. In the lower course the climate
is almost tropical, vegetation is rich and
profuse, and fish abundant. To a loyal sub-
ject of the British crown this river presents a
peculiar interest, because it marks the ad- ,
vance of Russia?s aggressiveness in the direc-
tion of India. In 1868 all the left bank of the
river was added to Slavonic demands, and all
the right bank below the junction with the
Ussurie River, and in 1860, all the territory
between the Ussurie and the eastern coast,
was annexed. Altogether this river has a
length of 2,770 miles, and a basin area of
square miles. The extent of country
drained by these four magnificent rivers in
Siberia is 4,250,000 square miles, an area
two-fifths greater th in the whole of Australia.
Coming down the map again, through
China, towards India, we meet with the
Burmah Empire, a third of which belongs to
Great Britian. There are several large rivers
in this part, but the largest and most
important of them is the Irrawaddi,
which rising in the extreme east
of India, developes into a splendid
stream of 1,200 miles in length, 24
of which pass through British Burmah, before
it finally falls in to the Bay of Bengal. It is
very deep, and as a rule from 600 yards to
four miles wide. Like the Nile, the Irrawaddi is
the main artery of the country through which
it passes.' Some idea of the volume of water
carried through its channels may be formed
from the statement that in 1877 four hundred
and sixty six thousand one hundred and
twenty millions, two hundred and eighty-
eight thousand nine hundred and forty
metre tons of water of thirty seven
cubic feet was spread over the soil, or car-
ried into the Bay of Bengal. In other words,
the Irrawaddi receives, in one year, a supply
of water sufficient to bury every square inch
of our Victorian soil mountains and valley
and plains "more than nine inches
deep in the fertilising fluid. The river basin
is not so large as from these figures we might
? expect it to be, being not more than 158,000
square miles. This river has always been the
sole high-way of communication between the
interior and the sea-board, through Siam,
Upper Burmah, and the Chinese frontier ;
vessels of large size trade in its waters. At
the present time ?the Irrawaddi Flotilla
Company,? an important English carrying
firm consisting of 60 steamers, secures a
considerable share of the trade. This com-
pany employs 2,000 hands, and spends

like �60,000 a year in, their
venture.
The river systems of Africa, have afforded,
during the present century, a subject of the
keenest interest to geographers ; and this
has been specially the case with respect to the
upper waters of the great,ancient and histori-
cal river Nile. The mystery which, for ages,
enshrouded its sources, has ever made it one
of the most interesting rivers of the world.
The explorations of Speke and Grant in 1861-
2; of Sir Samuel Baker, in 1863-4, and in
1871-2-3; of Gessi, an officer under Colonel
Gordon, when he was Governor-General of
Equatorial Africa in 1876; and of Stanley
more recently, have greatly added to the
renown of this magnificent river. A mere
glance at a modern map of Africa, will show
its vast importance to all future commerce,
cultivation, and possible civilising influences
yet in store for the great country of Equatorial
Africa and its inhabitants. Its course from
the headlands of the stream Shimiyu, about
five degrees to the south of the equator, and
250 miles west from the Zanzibar coast, on
northwards through the Lakes Victoria
Nyanza and Albert Nyanza, through the
Egyptian Soudan, and for the last well-nigh
1,000 miles, in a channel almost parallel
with the north-east coast of the Red
Sea into the Mediterranean Sea near the
Isthmus of Suez, cuts off a huge eastern
slice of the continent, a region including
Abyssinia and Nubia, and altogether an area
of something like 2,000,000 square miles.
The length of the Nile from its most western
knovn source is, inclusive of windings, little
short of 4,000 miles, and its basin exceeds
1,000,000 square miles. It has in it six falls,
or, more correctly speaking, rapids. I think
it would be quite safe to hazard the state-
ment that no river on the face of the earth
has been so much written about, or had asso-
ciated with it so many names of great men,
from Homer downwards, ancient and modern
statesmen, generals, explorers, and philan-
thropists, as this wonderful river which we
find enshrined in the eldest records of history,
and, not loss, in the pages of modern litera-
ture. The upper part of the river, above the
northern frontier of Abyssinia, is divided
into two courses called respectively, the Blue
and the White Nile. The eastern and shorter
of these two, viz., the Blue Nile, or the Bahr-
el-Azrek, was traced to its source in the
Abyssinian highlands in 1770, by the Scotch
traveller, James Bruce, 4-t Khartoum (the


place that will ever be remembered hy,
English-speaking people, at any rate, as the
death-place of General Gordon), it unites
with the greater, the western and true
branch, the White Nile or Bahr-el-Abiad.
In the extensive valley of the Nile, below
Khartoum to Cairo, it scarcely ever rains,
and never tpope than scantily below Cairo,
and the river owes its supplies wholly to the
copious rainfall in the region of its sources.
The rise and corresponding fall of the liver
are very gradual, the former begins about the
middle of June, and attains its maximum
height (which at Cairo registers 10 feet above
its lowest level) towards the end of Septem-
ber. The waters are thus, for at least a
third of the year, continually irrigating, more
effectually than any artificial works could
ever do, the whole fertile valley lying within
its range.
We have not time now to trace the course of
the Niger, the second largest river in Africa,
and with which the name of Mungo Park, as
its first intrepid explorer, must ever be as-
sociated ; nor of the fine Orange River, which
forms the northern boundary of the Cape
Colony, and after a stretch of over 1,050 miles
falls into the Atlantic Ocean; nor of the great
Zambesi, which pours its waters into the
lyiogambique Channel. Suffice it only to say
that the splendid forests, and riqe
fields which abound in the country through
which these rivers flow, are evidences of the
richness and fertility of the soil caused by
the presence of abundant water in a land so
thirsty that in some parts scores of rivers and
streams are absorbed by, and lost in, the
smds through which they pass. I think it
must be conceded that the interest in the
great river systems of Africa, which has been
awakened by modern travellers from Mungo
Park?s writings down to Stanley?s latest pub-
Upipiqn of darkest Africa, will but whet the
appetite for move minute?research, and that
such investigations must ultimately result in
the commingling of extensive foreign popula-
tion with the aboriginals of the country,
Splendidly as some parts of the older con-
tinents are watered, America possesses the
advantages over the old world, in having its
river systems more evenly distributed
throughout the length and breadth of its
teuritory. Unlike Asia, Africa and Australia
it is absolutely without any barren desert.
The great backbone of th<s continent is made
up of the Rocky Mountains or the

the cor)tj;n�nt, nearly the whole extent of
which is washed by the Pacific Ocean, Ope
peculiar result in the formation of American
rivers follows from this, via,, that on the !
western side of the watershed, the rivers are
short and of comparatively small volume, and
Qn the opposite, the eastern slopes, their
copras are extraordinarily long, and ramify
iptp eyery payt of the'cqptinent. We always
connect America in opr thoughts with great
things, great notions, groat enterprises and
schemes, and amongst the things that are
great are its systems of rivers and lakes. The
largest rivers In thp world are in South
America, and the most extensive groups of
lakes in the world are found in the river
system of the St, Lawrence in the south of
North America on the border of the United
fa^
Travelling up the map from south to north,
we come, in about 30 south latitude, to the
wonderful river of the Argentine Republic.
From the Andes and the mountains of
Brazil, mighty rivers have their origin, and
many of these meet and find their outlet in
& ee*&
the La Plata river, which, in reality, is not
a river, but an estuary receiving great rivers.
At its mouth, between Cape St. Antonio and
Cape St. Mary, it is more than 170 miles
wide. About 50 miles further up, near
Monte Video, its waters are quite fresh and
its width is reduced to 53 miles. Above
this point its network of channels are navi-
gable only at intervals, for shallows and
numerous sandbanks abound. The two
tributaries are the Parana and the
The current of the La Plata is
quite apparent from one to two hundred j
miles out in the open ocean of the Atlantic.
Its course, including that of the Parana, is
2,760 miles long, and its basin 1,295,400
square miles. Then near the equator, and
running almost parallel with it from west to
east, is the world?s greatest river, the Amazon,
or Maranon, also called the Orellana. This
river forms the watercourse of the enormohs
drain basins of the whole northern
portion of South America, and of the greater
part of Peru and Brazil in the south.
This river rises from a great number of
sources in the Andes. Its length is upwards
of 4,000 miles, along 3,300 of which there
are no obstructions to navigation. It flows
into the Atlantic under the equator through
a mouth that is more than 200 miles wide.
The Amazon, in its course, receives over 200
tributaries, 100 of which are navigable and


17 of them are between 1,000 and 2,300 miles
long. The breadth of the main stream
varies from three quarters of a mile at Nanta,
2,325 miles from its mouth, to seven miles in
various places. For nearly 1,000 miles from
the sea its depth is never less than 30 fathoms.
Higher up it ranges from 10 to 12 fathoms, |
and at its junction with the Ucayale just
i above Nanta, its depth is sufficient for the
largest vessels. The area drained by the. !
Amazon is 2,300,000 square miles, or more
than three-fourths of the Australian con-
tinent, The Amazop water system affords
a surface area of 50,000 square miles
suited to navigation. Steamers began to ply
on its waters in 1853, and since 1867, the
river course has been open to all nations,and
the trade is rapidly increasing. The mingling
of the waters of the river with those of the
ocean gives rise to a remarkable phenomenon
called the Prororoca, which is said to be one
of the most imposing sights in nature. A
poetical writer has described it thus : ??The
waters of the Orellana, and those of the
ocean precipitate themselves into the battle
like two armies ; with their foaming waters
the shores are inundated; rocks, dragged
along like so many tiny pebbles, dash against
each other on the back of the billow which
bears them ; you might say that the genius
of the river and the God of the ocean, con-
tended for-the empire of the waves. ?yt
Crossing the Isthmus of Panama, and
rounding the Gulf of Mexico to about the
middle point of it, we come to the great
mouth of the Mississippi, in the United
States of North America. Its course lies
wholly within the territory of the United
States, and if, after receiving the waters of
the Missouri, it be regarded as but one river,
from the sources of that stream, its course
will be 4,265 miles, and must then be viewed
as the longest and second greatest river in
the world. Compared with the mighty
Amazon, it is a narrow stream, its breadth
nowhere, except at its five mouths,
exceeding half a mile. It is navig*
able for 2,240 miles, and it, and its
tributaries drain a basin of more than
1,250,000 square miles. It is described as a
rapid desolating torrent, loaded with mud.
In spring time, when the snows melt, it is
subject to very destructive floods, which
sweep down whole forests, rendering the
navigation extremely dangerous. Huge
trees, it is said, are deposited all over the
enormous delta for hundreds of square miles:


I > T o't?4e enters toe Mississippi out the inth�>
ion :�f its banks is an annual event. Not-
, vithstandir.g this, the navigation on the
i-iver has assumed very large proportions.
| Quite a fleet of vessels, comprising 1,500
t steamers, and perhaps as many large flat-
I bottomed barges, have their home upon the
stream. The delta of the Missippi is 150
miles broad, and contains an area of 14,000
square miles, which is protected from the
effects of the annual inundations, by a com
plicated system of levees or embankments.
The next river that we meet with in our up-
ward march through the continent is the
beautiful St. Laurence. This furnishes a
clearly defined boundary line between at
least half the southern territory of British
America and the United States. The com-
mercial capital of the Dominion of Canada,
Montreal, Quebec, the next largest city ip
the dominion, and Toronto, the capital of
the province of Ontario, are all situated on
its banks. The upper part of the river might
not inaptly be called the great river of lakes.
It takes its rise at the south-east of that
magnificent sheet of water, the most westerly
and most elevated of the North American
chain of lakes, and which is said to be the
largest expanse of fresh water in the world?
viz., Lake Superior, between Ontario,
in Canada, and Minnesota, in the
United States, Its area, 32,000 square
miles, is greater by nearly one fourth
than the whole of Tasmania. From
this lake it issues, ovqr a series of waterfalls,
by the St. Mary?s River, and, after passing
through the Lakes Huron, St. Clair and
Erie?from the latter of which it flows over
the world-renowued Falls of Niagra into
Lake Ontario?it empties, after a total course
of 2,000 miles, into the Gulf of St. Lawrence.
Some idea of the vast extent of these five
lakes may be gained from the statement that,
in the aggregate, they are about equal to the
whole of Victoria, some 88,000 square miles.
From Lake Ontario to its deboushure in the
St. Lawrence Gulf, is about 1,000 miles, and
as in this part of the course there are many
rapids, it is of but little use to navigation.
This defect, however,has been fully compen-
sated for by a series of canals on the British
side, The river itself, however, is navigable as
far as Montreal from the sea, for ships of 600
tons, and to Quebec for vessels of the largest
size.

r .v to descr/o�, such as I he' Columbia hit the
west of the United States; theSaskatchewjh.fi
which, rising in two head streams, the Ndrtlf
and South Saskatchewan in the Rocky*
Mountains, on the ease of British Columbia,
empties into Lake Winnipeg and thence in-
creases the waters of the St. Lawrence. The
mighty Orinoco River, with its beautiful cas-
cades in the upper course, its weary stretch
for hundreds of miles of a sea of grass, as flat
and level as a table, and its enormous
delta, beginning 130 miles before it reaches
the Atlantic, and again, the M?Kenzie River
in the extreme north, which, flowing out of
the Great Slave Lake, empties itself, through
many mouths, at M?Kenzie Bay, into the
Apqtic Ocean; the Ypkop }n the WRst or Rus-
sian American, as f he territory is called in
the old maps. All these and others, though
full of interest, we must leave now.
Europe, the smallest, except Australia, of
the five great divisions of the earth, is well
watered by rivers, which, though in many
cases, the high-ways of busy and continuous
navigation,and intimately associated with the
history and progress of the European races,
are, nevertheless, insignificant streams when
compared with the mighty rivers of Asia,
Africa, and America.
I will ' qite but one example in support of
this statement, and I take it '?in globq?-from
Lewis Figuiers?work on ?Earth and Sea,?
as translated by Davenport Adams. ? The
Iser, a small Bavarian stream, receives in its
course 860 affluents on the left bank, and 433
on the right ; it, therefore, is fed by 1,294
springs, to which 136 lakes are added ; all
these waters are poured into the Iser through
103 tributaries.? It is easy to understand the
usefulness (nay, may we not say, the great-
ness) of such a river to the country it
irrigates, drains, and refreshes. Yet the
Iser, ?rolling rapidly,? is but one of the
34 tributaries of the Danube, which itselt
is' not included among the' greater rivers
of the earth.? Rearing in mind then, my
second definition of great rivers, we shall
find some of these in Europe to be amongst
the greatest of all. The population of
Europe, though not half of that of Asia, i
comes next in order to it, amongst the
other great recognised divisions of the globe,
and in character, culture, enterprise, in- ,
dustry, qqmmgpp am} tradp, it far surpasses
Util qther peoples qf the earth. This su-n
periority has enabled the European nations,
in many instances, to make a more extensive*


j uge of gift of rivers than other races
of men have done, Take for instance the
Danube, the second largest and moat im-
portant of all the rivers in Europe. Engi-
neering skill and enterprise hare made it,
for general utility and commerce, one of the
greatest rivers of the world. Flowing
through some of the most thickly populated
parts of Europe, it has become so much a
highway of the nations that a special com-
mission, embracing representatives from
each of the great European powers interested
in its waters, was appointed some years ago
to manage matters relating to its course.
Of this Danubian commission the late
General Gordon, then Colonel Gordon, was,
in 1871, appointed the British member; and
the present deep Sulina Channel, the largest
of its four outlets to the Black Sea, and the
mouth by which most of the larger vessels
and steamers enter, was mainly due to his
professional skill as a naval engineer. The
Danube originates in two small streams in
that mountainous region of south west Ger
many, where the Black Forest flourishes. It
flows through Bavaria, Austria, Hungary,
Bulgaria and Roumania. For ages a con-
siderable part of its course has formed the
i boundary line in Europe between Christen-
dom and the Mohammedan Empire. It re-
vives the waters of the Alpine basin, as well
as the drainage from the southern slope of
the Carthanian Mountains, Its direction, in
a straight line from source to mouth, is up-
wards of a thousand miles, but including
windings it is 2,423 miles. The area of its
basin is 530,000 square miles. Its debouchure
is into the Black Sea, through four mouths,
or which the improved Sulina is the deepest,
and most used, Wurtemburg, Vienna, and
several important cities are situated on its
banks. Just after it crosses the Austrian
border and enters Turkey, it passes through,
at Orsova, the rugged defile of Balkan, his-
torically known as the ? Iron Gates.?
The Volga, Russia?s great river, is the
longest in Europe, and with the exception of
the Danube, the one which conveys th�
greatest volume of water. Its source is a
small lake in the Valdai Hills, and after a
winding course of 2,460 miles it empties
into the Caspian Sea by about 70 mouths,
which spread out, forming a vast delta, just
below Astrakhan, the capital of the govern-
ment in the south east of European Russia.
Its basin area is about 650,000 square miles.
It ia navigable for barges from its source, but


during halt the year it is frozen over. A
system of canals has established communica-
tion between the river and the Caspian,
Baltic, and Polar Seas,
The Dnieper, another of the largest Euro-
pean rivers, is in Russia. It flows west
emptying into the Gulf Perekop, just opposite
to the Crimea, in the Black Sea, It is
famous for its magnificent series of cataracts,
beginning about 200 miles from its mouth,
and extending some 30 or 40 miles down
stream. It is navigable both below and
above these falls. Its basin is 246,000 square
miles.
The Don, the fourth largest European
river, also belongs to Russia. It issues from
the Lake Ivan-Ozera, in the Government of
Tula; its length is 1,120 miles, and the area
of its basin about 240,000 square miles. It
fall into the Sea of Azof. The broad central
ridge of the Ural Mountains forming the
boundary between the west of Asia and the
east of Russia, furnishes the latter country
with an abundant river supply, which geo-
graphers have classified as draining off into
four great oceanic basins, viz., the Arctic,
the Baltic, the Black Sea and the Caspian
Sea. None of the rest of the European
rivers can be called great in magnitude,
not �ne of them being as much as 800
miles in length ; though, if time permitted,,
many of them might be referred to as of I
great historical and national importance,
such as the Rhine and the Rhone, the Seine
and the Po, the Thames and the Tiber, etc.
And so much, also, may be said of the still
shorter streams of Norway and Sweden,
their importance must be gauged not so much
by their length in miles, nor their volume In
bulk, as by the adequacy with which they
meet the various needs of the people through
whose territories they pass,
Australia having no very high mountain
chains, has, consequently, no enormous river
systems. New South Wales and Victoria
have the greatest watershed, und, therefore,
an ampler network of rivers than any of the -
sister colonies possess. South Australia has
the Alberga River connecting the large lakes
in the interior?Lake Amadeus and Lake
Eyre. Queensland has the Flinders and
Mitchell, whigheippt-yinto theGulfof Carpen-
taria from the east *nd the Nicholson from
the west, which after receiving the Herbert
and Gregory, also empties into that huge
gulf. Western Australia has the Gascoyne,
whose embouchure � Marks? Bay; the Mur-


cliison and the Curlew-, or Ashburton, both
flow into the Indian Ocean below Exmouth
Oulf. But the great Australian river is the
Murray. It has the longest course, the
greatest number of tributaries, the largest
volume of water, and the most extensive
basin area. It rises in the Australian Alps
not far from Forest Hill, or Kosciusko, the
highest mountain peak in Australia, Not
far from its source .are the precipitous
rocks, called the Murray Gates, which
| tower above for 3,000 feet. It forms
j the boundary line between Victoria and that
part of New South Wales named Riverina.
It receives from the New South Wales side
the Murrumbidgee, the Lachlan, and the
Darling ; and on the Victorian side, the
Ovens, the Goulburn, the Campaspe, and
many smaller streams. Its course from
source to mouth is 1,300 miles, but from the
source of its longest tributary, the Darling,
to the Murray mouth, the total length of the
river, according to Mr. Hayter in his Vic-
torian Year-book for 1889-90, is 2,345 miles.
After entering the eastern boundary of the
South Australian territory, and flowing
almost due west for nearly 100 miles, it
turns nearly at right angles, and flowing
through low lauds in a westerly direc-
tion, it enters the marshy lake of
Alexandrina, and then expands itself
in Encounter Bay, to the east of Cape
Jarvis, and about 60 miles in a direct line
from Adelaide. The average depth of the
Murray is 16 feet, and breadth, 240 feet.
The extent of the drainage basin of the
Murray and its contributories, is 300,000
Squote miles. This, of course, includes
Riverina and a great portion of New South
Wales territory. The greater half of Vic-
toria belongs to this river basin, which, in
its entirety, is equal to an area three and a
half times as large as the whole of Victoria.
In 1829 Captain Sturt traced the Murrum-
bidgee down to its junction with the Murray
between Swan Hill and Wentworth. In
1836 Major Mitchell, afterwards Sir Thomas
Mitchell, explored the Murray and made the
discovery that the Darling River joined it.
Since then the township of Wentworth has
sprung up atthe junction.Both theMurrayand (
its larger tributaries have for many years
been navigable during certain seasons of the 1
year. In our Art Gallery may be seen a
picture by Mr. Panton, representing the
first steamer on the Murray, that of Captain
Cadell, in 1854 ; the remains of this steamer


rpay pow be ssen erpbqdded in tfig New
South Wales opposite the wharf at
E]chnca. So large a trade in the carriage of
wool and other commodities has been carried
on between Echuca and other places in river
communication with it, that for many years
it has enjoyed the honor of being the second
port in Victoria?that is second only to
Melbourne. And now that Mildura is
rapidly coming to the front as an agricul-
tural and horticultural ares, it is probable that
navigation on the lower riverto Adelaide will
Ultimately develop into an extensive trade.
The particulars I have referred to, though
numerous and diversified, furnish, after all?
but a superficial and meagre account ?of
piy subject. I have taken no notice of the
laws that regulate the rate of currents, of
the force of down-rushing torrents, of the
variety and multiplicity of living forms
for which the rivers of the earth
provide a home; of the beds, as
rich store-houses of shell deposits and?
fosils, hiding and conserving treasures to
be examined in the laboratories of our
natural scientists, and classified and labelled
for our national museums ; of the mighty
powers of human ingenuity they evoke in
the planning and construction of engineering
works ; or, in the application of mechanical
contrivances to utilise the force which their
streams inherently possess, and a
thousand other benefits, the great rivers of
the earth confer on mankind.
