Prisoners under Sentence of Transportation.
MALE convicts under sentence of transportation will, in ordinary cases, be subjected to three periods of discipline before they serve out the term of their sentence
or obtain a conditional pardon in the Colony to which they may be sent.
Ist. The first period will be passed in separate confinement.
2nd. The second period will be passed at hard labour on public works under strict discipline for a period proportioned to the sentence.
3rd. The third period will be passed with a Ticket of Leave in one of Her Majesty?s Colonies.
iIPARATE COIPIAEMEIT.
The duration of the first period will in some measure be regulated by the character, conduct, and industry of a prisoner, and his fitness for association with others.
A prisoner may be recommended on special grounds for removal from separate confinement at any period of his imprisonment, but in ordinary cases the following
rule will be followed:?
The maximum period to be passed in separate confinement will be eighteen months. Records will be kept by the Governor, Chaplain, Schoolmaster, and other
Officers, of the conduct and character of each prisoner undergoing this punishment; monthly examinations of these records will be made by the superior authorities of
the prison, who will grant to deserving prisoners a good conduct badge to be worn on their dress. Prisoners obtaining these badges and not forfeiting them by
subsequent misconduct, will be eligible to be recommended for removal from separate confinement at an earlier period than others. In case of the prisoners under
sentence of transportation for only seven years, and who shall have obtained a certain number of badges, the authorities will be enabled to recommend to the Secretary
of State that they may be removed direct to a Colony, with a Ticket of Leave, instead of undergoing penal discipline on public works.
Xioticc to Prisoners employon Public Works
? Prisoners having usually undergone separate confinement for a certain term, will be required, before their removal from this country, to labour on Public Works,
under strict discipline, for a period proportionate to the term of their original sentence, after which they will be sent to one of the British Colonies.
? Prisoners who do not misconduct themselves will be eligible to be recommended to the Secretary of State for Tickets of Leave in one of the Colonies, on the
expiration of one-half of the term of their original sentences, according to the following scale, (No. 1,) which has been prepared with reference to the respective terms of
transportation. By obtaining special reports of good conduct, they may entitle themselves to this indulgence at an earlier period, according to following Scale (No. 2.)
SCALE Ho. 1.
Ordinary Periods of Detention on Public Works, proportioned to the Terms of different Sentences.
A Prisoner sentenced to 7 Wears, for a period not less than 2 Wears.

Witto 211 ? , 9 84 ?

These periods, together with the previous term passed in separate confinement and the time occupied in the voyage, are calculated to make up about half the period
of sentence.-f It is, however, to be clearly understood, that it is only in cases of prisoners conducting themselves in a satisfactory manner, that any such remission
of their sentence can be recommended.
As a further encouragement, however, such prisoners as conduct themselves in an exemplary manner, and who shew by their general demeanour and willing industry,
that they have profited by the instruction they have received, and are likely to become useful members of society when released from penal discipline, will be eligible
to be specially recommended to the Secretary of State for a Ticket of Leave, at the expiration of one-half the period stated on the foregoing Scale, or at any time
between that and the ordinary term stated in the Scale, No. 1, viz.:?
SCALE No. 2.
Minimum Period of Detention on Public Works, applicable to Prisoners whose
Conduct is exemplary.
A Prisoner sentenced to 7 Wears, for a period not less than 1 Wear.

In order that every prisoner may be aware of his situation, and the effect which his conduct may have in diminishing or extending his period of probationary
discipline, records of his conduct, attainments, and industry will be kept by the Governor, Chaplain, and other Officers, which will be examined monthly, or oftener
if required, and the results communicated to the prisoner.
If a prisoner?s conduct has been in all respects exemplary during the month, he will, after the monthly Report, be recommended to the Visitors or other superior
authority for a badge to be worn on his dress, which, if not forfeited by subsequent misconduct, will afterwards enable the Visitors to recommend him for a remission
of one month of the period of detention set forth in Scale No. 1.
Thus a prisoner under sentence for 7 years conducting himself in an exemplary manner for 12 months after his reception, would place himself in a position to be
specially recommended for 12 months? remission of the period laid down in Scale No. 1, and might be brought forward for embarkation with a Ticket of Leave in
the minimum period of 12 months, as laid down in Scale No. 2.
Or a prisoner under sentence for 10 years conducting himself in an exemplary manner for 18 months, would place himself in a position to be recommended for
embarkation with a Ticket of Leave in the minimum period of 18 months, as laid down in Seale No. 2, instead of being detained 34 years as prescribed for ordinary
cases in No. 1.
Prisoners entitled to a less number of badges would be eligible for recommendation at some intermediate period.
TICKETS OF LEAVE.
The holder of a Ticket of Leave will be required to remain within a certain district, which will be prescribed by the Governor of the Colony, where he will have
the means of working for wages; but if he misconducts himself, or wilfully remains in idleness when employment can be obtained, he will be liable to forfeit his
Ticket of Leave, and to be again subjected to penal discipline. On the other hand, if he conducts himself well he will be eligible to be recommended by the
Governor of the Colony (according to the regulations which from time to time may be in force) for a conditional pardon ; but in ordinary cases none will be so
recommended until they shall have repaid out of their wages a certain sum towards the expense of their conveyance to the Colony.
FAMILIES DF COAVICTi.
Arrangements will be made by which assistance will be given towards defraying the expenses of the passage to the Colony of the wives and families of well-
conducted convicts, on the remainder of the expense being provided from private sources.
* Sentence for Life to be reckoned at 24 Years.
f The average term to be passed in separate confinement being assumed at 12 months, any greater or less period will be taken into account in determining the period of detention laid down in this Scale.
Note ?The indulgence of a Ticket of Leave on arrival at the Colony may he withheld if a prisoner misconducts himself on the voyage.
