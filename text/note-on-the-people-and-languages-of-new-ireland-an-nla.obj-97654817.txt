Note on the People and Languages of New Ireland and
Admiralty Islands.
Sidney H. Eay.
(From letters of the Eev. E. H. Eickard.)
The Vocabularies here given were sent to me last year by
the Eev. E. H. Eickard, of the Wesleyan Mission in New
Britain. They were collected by him at Nusa, on the northern
extremity of New Ireland, and at Green Island, in the Admiralty
Group, in December, 1886, during an excursion round the
Bismarck Archipelago, made from the mission head-quarters at
Kabakada in the Gazelle Peninsula, New Britain. Mr. Eickard
has joined to these a short list of words from the Western end


of New Britain, opposite Huon Gulf, and for the sake of com-
parison I have added the equivalents in the two best known
languages of the region, those of Ealuana and Duke of York
Island.
An account of the New Ireland natives was read before this
Institute, in 1886, by Mr. A. J. Duftield, as a supplement to
which I condense the following from Rev. E. H. Rickard’s
letters.
Nusa. —The people are nearly nude. The women wear an
apron or leaf not larger than a leaf of the Australian gum tree,
and long peaked hats made of pandanus leaves sewn together.
The men blacken half only of the top and bottom row of their
teeth, or in some instances half the top row and the opposite half
of the lower. The men also shave parts of their heads, leaving
various shaped looks—triangular, diamond shaped, &c. A chiefs
wife came on board the vessel alone, a thing which would never
have taken place in New Britain, and which points to alow
state of morals.
Fisher Islands and St. John’s Island. —The people here are the
same as at Nusa, speaking the same language and having the
same customs. They live in large villages. All the natives of
this district are notorious cannibals. In one place Mr. Rickard
was assured that a tribe lived by fighting for any party who
might hire them, the only payment sought being the bodies of
the slain.
Faed Group. —These consist of two circular lagoons about four
miles apart, with several islands, but only one group is inhabited.
Cocoanut palms are abundant, but the population is small (about
200) and is fast dying out. The natives are light brown
Polynesians, speaking a language allied to that of 1 ord
Howe Islands and Stewart Islands. A Samoan could under-
stand them in a very short time. The islanders are ruled by
one man, and are in a very miserable condition, with small huts
and untidy plantations.
Carteret Islands. —The people here are black Melanesians,
speaking the language of Buka (Solomon Islands). 1 They are
in as wretched a condition as the Paed Islanders.
In the Journal of the Institute for 1877 will be found a
detailed account of the natives of the Admiralty Group by
Mr. H. N. Moseley, the naturalist to the Challenger expedition,
chiefly relating to D’Entrecasteaux Island and Wild Island.
I extract the following from Mr. Rickard’s letters :
Admiralty Group :—“ The men were quite nude, with long
1 Buka Vocabularies are given by H. Zoller—“ Petermann’s Mitteilungen,”

Head Hunters,” p. 225.


combed hair, in which is carried a comb. They are of average-
height, none of them stout, with sharp Jewish countenances;
their skin more coppery and bright than that of the New Britain
natives. They were keen traders, the articles most in request
being knives, carpenter’s tools and beads. They gave in exchange
flint-pointed daggers and spears, carved bowls, ornamented
o-ourds, large, clay cooking vessels, and other articles. In the
island ’of AVaikatu the houses were built on piles driven into
the rock. Some of these piles were eighteen inches thick and
about eight feet above the water. One house stood on thirty or
forty piles, and was about fifty or sixty feet long, twenty feet
wide, and ten feet high. At each end was a large shutter. A
loft contained the inmate’s household treasures, which consisted
chiefly of bowls and clay pots filled with oil. The floor of the
house was formed of the thick outer shell of a palm, and
was reached by a ladder from the platform near the water.
“ The canoes of these islands are built of strong timber, with a
heavy but neat outrigger one side and a slanting platform on
the other. They have a house on deck, and carry fire, food, and
cooking utensils.”
(A detailed account of these canoes, with diagrams, was
given by Mr. Moseley, see “ Jour. Anthrop. Inst.,” vol. vi.)
While Mr. Eickard was at AVaikatu one of the king’s wives
lay dead. The corpse was embalmed in oil, and after it had
lain ten days the skull would be scraped and cleaned, the
remainder of the body being buried.
The women wore grass petticoats, and seemed to have a good
position among the men.
The government seemed to be in the hand of one chief, as in
Fiji, and not as in New Britain. The men of the whole village
received their food from the chief, and the houses were built
collectively for the use of all, not as in New Britain, by a man
and his wife alone. The chief’s word was immediately obeyed.
A boy wished to go away with Mr. Packard’s party, but the
chiefs refusal stopped him.

Islands isu , ihu, &c., New Hebrides ngisu, ngusu, &c.; 9. gisa = New Guinea,
Motu isu , Kabadi nise, Maiva nihe; 8 and 9 are probably from the same root,
originally meaning “point” ; the last three words and word for “ear ” show a


suffix ra— their ; 13. niw is a common word, lama in Samoan is the candle-nut
tree; 14. «<9i=Motu and south-east New Guinea hui = “ hair ” or “feather”*

Duke of York Island mama, shallow water; 21. l<ma«=Banks Island and
Aurora lam, &c.; tas, tai, ta, a common word for “ salt ” or “ salt water; ”
24. nanus = Motu ranu, a widely-spread word for “fresh water”; 25. vivili—
Motu Uhiria, to blow with the mouth; 29. luma = Caroline Islands, Kusaie
lorn, the common word, ruma ; pal, bali =th o Polynesian fale; 30. saman =

Polynesian susu; 8,9, 10, common words ; 11, po-ngusi = Fiji ngusu, lip ; see
8, 9 in foregoing note ; in 4, 9 and 12, the prefix, bo, po, may be compared with

mat are common words ; 51. see foregoing note on Nusa (41) ; 52. liin, a form
of the common, Wei, riki.
The numerals call for no special remark. They are formed according to the
imperfect decimal notation of Dr. Codrington (Melau. Lang., p. 224), with prefixes
for the numbers from 6 to 9, and the common sangavul =lo. The correspon-
dence of the Ealuana prefix lav with the same in Banks Island is worthy of note.
In Green Island andra probably = minus, and andra lua, andra sf=less 2, less 1.
About 74 per cent, of the Nusa words here given agree with
Melanesian forms. The proportion in the other vocabularies
is not so large, being 67 per cent, in the list from Western New
Britain, and about 56 per cent, in Green Island. In these notes
I have only pointed out the most obvious agreements, but there
is no doubt that closer investigation and a better knowledge of
the languages of the Solomon Islands will prove more clearly
the close connection of these languages with the Melanesian.
The original speech of the natives of the New Guinea mainland
may or may not belong to the Melanesian family, but it seems
clear that Melanesians have taken possession of the islands
around the eastern extremity, as well as of the south-eastern
shores.

I may perhaps be allowed to add a few remarks upon what
has already been written upon the languages of this neigh-
bourhood. The Nusa words vary considerably from those of
other parts of the same island. In three New Ireland vocabu-
laries, given by Schellong, 1 only eight words agree with the
Nusa, and although Rook Island is close to the western end of
New Britain, only six words are the same in the list here given,
and the one given by Zoller 2 for Rook Island.
Mr. H. N. Moseley 3 pointed out a few agreements between
the words in his vocabulary from D’Entrecasteaux and Wild
Islands, and the Fiji, Polynesian, and New Hebrides, but sought
to connect the language with the Yap of the Caroline Islands
rather than with the Melanesian. The chief point of agreement
with the Yap, as he showed, is in the formation of the numerals
for eight (anda, huap, andra lua ) and nine ( anda sip, andra si)
by subtraction, anda and andra apparently meaning “ minus,” and
huap and sip being the words for two and one. In Schellong’s voca-
bulary for Admiralty Islands the same formation appears, seven
being sua-tolo, eight shua-luea, nine shu-ri, and tolo, luvea, ri the
words for three, two, and one. These Admiralty forms corres-
pond to the Yap me-delip, seven; me-rulc, eight; me-rip, nine ;
from odalip, three; lakrue, two ; darip, one. This formation is
not found in other languages of the Caroline Islands.
A vocabulary of twenty-five words from Elizabeth Island in
the Admiralty Group is given by Zoller: —
1 “Die Jabim-Sprache der Finschliafener Gegend (N. O. Neu Guinea),” yon
Dr. O. Schellong, Leipzig, 1890.
2 “ Petermann’s Mitteilungen,” 36 Band, 1890, y, p. 127. “ Untersucliungen
iiber 24 Sprachen aus dem Scliubzgebiet der Neuguinea Compagnie,” von Hugo
Zoller.
3 “ Journ. Anthrop. Inst.,” vol. vi, 1877, p. 379.

(Words in italic agree with Rev. R. H. Rickard’s list.)
In twenty words common to the Green Island and Elizabeth
Island vocabularies fifteen are the same. Two other vocabularies
from the Admiralty Islands are given by Schellong. The exact
locality to which the first belongs is not stated, and it only
contains a few words which agree, with Mr. Eickard’s vocabulary.
The second is said to be from Green Island, but with a note 1
which shows that it was obtained from a native on a trading
vessel. It does not represent the language of Green Island,
although a few words are the same. If it is the language of any
particular district it belongs to the island of Buka, in the
Solomon’s. A vocabulary given to Mr. C. W. Woodford, 2 by his
boy Hogare, as the language of his native village of Lehona,
Buka Island, is nearly identical with Schellong’s language of Green
Island. The Buka vocabulary of Zoller also closely agrees with
it. The following extract from Schellong shows how widely
his two vocabularies differ from Eev. E. H. Eickard’s
Admiralty.

Words in italics agree with Eev. E. H. Eickard’s list, those
marked (*) agree with the Buka of Woodford and Zoller.
Besides these the words for star, sea, cocoanut, cockatoo, finger,
and skin, in Woodford, and for eat, village, and yam, in Zoller'
are the same as in Schellong’s so-called Green Island.
